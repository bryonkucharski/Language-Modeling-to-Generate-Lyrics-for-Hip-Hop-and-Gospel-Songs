Scared money don't make money, so what you scared for? 
 And real people do real things, so what you waiting for? 
 A stand up nigga stand up the rest of their lives (Yeah) 
 And real G's do what they want, don't ever think twice 
 Uh, it go, one for the money 
 Two for the niggas gettin' it 
 Three for the niggas that be running from it 
 You gotta grind if you really want it 
 Don't hesitate 
 You came this far (?) the whole dream 
 Nobody said it'd be easy though, just stick to your plan 
 They don't understand 
 Going up against the odds 
 Having no regards 
 Make our own laws, you can be your own boss 
 But they don't tell you that all you need is a foundation to stand on 
 And you can build it then the limit is the sky 
 Until then I'm with my niggas getting high 
 And plus we with it you all know the business 
 Scared money don't make money, so what you scared for? 
 And real people do real things, so what you waiting for? 
 A stand up nigga stand up the rest of their lives 
 And real G's do what they want, don't ever think twice 
 Oh what did you think I would never get another M? 
 Niggas in the game 'cause we let 'em in 
 We ain't check they chains 
 We ain't put 'em on blast and expose them fools for everything 
 We ain't tell you how they really lames 
 And that they don't do shit that they get on TV and say 
 We ain't mad though, we on the coast of France for three days 
 I'm tryna make a play, marijuana steam sauna 
 Young ngiga from the bottom cracking lobster, eating pasta 
 You would think that he a mobster 
 La Familia, you are not familiar 
 Just got a bigger safe, now it's time to fill up, nigga 
 Scared money don't make money, so what you scared for? 
 And real people do real things, so what you waiting for? 
 A stand up nigga stand up the rest of their lives 
 (Stand your ass up) 
 And real G's do what they want, don't ever think twice 
 (Do something about it)
