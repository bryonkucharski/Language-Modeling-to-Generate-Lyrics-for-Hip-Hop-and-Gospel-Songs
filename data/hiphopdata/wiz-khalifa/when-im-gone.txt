(Wiz Khalifa - Verse 1) 
 And they say all I rap about is bitches and champagne, 
 You would too if every night you seen the same thing 
 Money wall to wall, young famous n-gga, spend it all, 
 When you die you can't take it with ya 
 Bottle of Rose if I'm drinking with ya 
 Cause most n-ggas is broke their bank is injured 
 Then bitches gonna ride with who they think's a winner 
 And I'll be smiling in case they take a picture 
 Oh, I'm smoking weed drinking liquor make a hundred 
 On a show spend it all on my n-ggas 
 When I go shopping I tell them pick one 
 'Cause they was with me when nobody seen a vision 
 Always about my business don't play the cards 
 I talked to the n-ggas who dealed them, uh 
 Royal flush, now look up them n-ggas and baby girl you see us, yeah 
 I'm gonna spend it all why wait for another day 
 I?ma take all this money I own and blow it all away 
 'Cause I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone 
 No I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone 
 I'm gonna spend it all why wait for another day 
 I?ma take all this money I own and blow it all away 
 'Cause I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone 
 No I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone 
 (Wiz Khalifa - Verse 2) 
 Hella hoes in my car, they wanna feel that maximum speed 
 Never had an absence of weed 
 Tired of being at the bar, everything Louie V, 
 Plus the most exclusive treat in my jar 
 Making my bank, spending it all 
 And that expensive shit you paid for, she had it on 
 She taking it off, most of these n-ggas just talk and taking it off 
 Back in the day money was short, I'm making it taller 
 You know what I mean, some say it's a problem 
 Blowings my greens, not saving my collards 
 No NBA, they say I'm a baller 
 Live for today, it's not like my father 
 I'm gonna spend it all why wait for another day 
 I?ma take all this money I own and blow it all away 
 'Cause I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone 
 No I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone 
 I'm gonna spend it all why wait for another day 
 I?ma take all this money I own and blow it all away 
 'Cause I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone 
 No I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone.
