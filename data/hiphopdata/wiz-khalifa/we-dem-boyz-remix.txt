Hol up, hol up, we dem boyz 
 Hol up, hol up, we dem boyz 
 Hol up, hol up, we makin' noise 
 Hol up, we dem boyz 
 Now I've been in this game for a long time and I'm still getting money 
 Hol up, hol up, we dem boyz 
 Hol up, hol up, we makin' noise 
 Paranoid as a child, blessed to be a dreamer 
 Bitch we dem boys, nigga we the Beatles 
 1-8-7 no appeal, get it how you live 
 Before I go broke accountants jump off a bridge 
 First round draft pick, hittas stay in the field 
 On that poor side of town, grinding to pay our bills 
 They hate to see you flourish, so I draw the curtains 
 I'm so high up in the sky that my I won't get no service 
 Democracy be the dope, community in the choke 
 The warden just caught his case, he was looking forward to vote 
 Nigga count your blessings, lighters on the dresser 
 I scoped it, a whole body, so yes I'm well invested 
 From Fig row to the airport to them Iceland hoes 
 Head to London then to Paris, double sold out shows 
 Then I fell asleep in my Saint-Laurent and woke up, stunt more 
 And just recent nigga, my teeth is nickel, got disco-ball glow 
 Niggas throwin' shots but I dodge 'em all, you can't touch this 
 Don't believe if my name involved in some punk shit 
 Half a mil a week, crib by the beach, got bank roll 
 Got a bitch who got booty-cheeks, good neck though 
 Hold up, hol up, hol up, this game we play, you can't control us 
 Hol up, hol up, they knew us cause the way we pulled up 
 Hold up, hol up, my bitch her shape like Coca-Cola 
 Hold up, hol up, Wiz on joints, my woods be rolled up 
 Hol up, hol up, we dem boyz 
 Hol up, hol up, we dem boyz 
 Hol up, hol up, we makin' noise 
 Hol up, we dem boyz 
 Now I've been in this game for a long time and I'm still getting money 
 Hol up, hol up, we dem boyz 
 Hol up, hol up, we makin' noise 
 I never give a rat a pass, it's the fattest ass that attracts me 
 How do I define Nasty? Ghastly 
 Explain Esco 
 Plain and simple - with a redbone in the Benz'o sippin' XO 
 From the Don to God's Son, the Project Prophet, the live one 
 The father of Destiny, Knight's pops, Will's man 
 Jungle's brother 
 Girl, I house you like the Jungle Brothers, understand 
 I shine before y'all time 
 I been outside when T La Rock invented rhymes 
 When dinner time and BBS's on tinted Saab's was getting robbed 
 I'm 20 in, still outside, don't ask for it 
 That parched up from here on, that half moon is that Nas cut 
 We been 'em niggas that's been them niggas, ask any nigga 
 Mass Appeal, HSTRY, Henny sippers, let's get it nigga 
 Hol up, hol up, we dem boyz 
 Hol up, hol up, we dem boyz 
 Hol up, hol up, we makin' noise 
 Hol up, we dem boyz 
 Now I've been in this game for a long time and I'm still getting money 
 Hol up, hol up, we dem boyz 
 Hol up, hol up, we makin' noise 
 Keys to my estate, put the cheese inside a safe 
 Drinkin' by the case, that be the reason why they hate 
 Fresh up outta cell to the seats of private planes 
 Roll at least an ounce a day, smokin' weed is my escape 
 Peddle to the floor, make sure my niggas straight 
 Every city-state, I'm tryna break the piggie bank 
 Some niggas get put on, some niggas get played 
 Take another selfie, watch my lawyer beat the case 
 We Dem Boyz 
 Hol up, hol up, we dem boyz 
 Hol up, hol up, we dem boyz 
 Hol up, hol up, we makin' noise 
 Hol up, we dem boyz 
 Now I've been in this game for a long time and I'm still getting money 
 Hol up, hol up, we dem boyz 
 Hol up, hol up, we makin' noise
