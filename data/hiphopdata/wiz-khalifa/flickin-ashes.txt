Yeah 
 Swisher Sweets, no Phillies 
 Yeah 
 Me I'm riding clean, smoking good, can barely keep my eyes open 
 Listening to my favorite song, leaning in my ride chokin' 
 Tell my dog to hit this weed, feel like I'mma pass out 
 Thought I had exclusive trees, until he pulled his bag out 
 Had 'bout a half ounce, some shit I've never seen in life 
 Said that once he grabbed it, smelled so bad he had to bag it twice 
 I told him roll that shit up, this weed I had to light 
 These clowns somewhere in the clouds, me I'm a satellite 
 I roll them very nice, with smoke coming out the end like a muffler 
 Got game from the Hustla, never said I'm gon' quit 
 I can't get enough of good weed in my lungs, plus I'm sharin' I ain't cuffin' 
 My eyes wide shut, I'm just staring saying nothing 
 I flick ashes, got big staus, so I don't need a dime, I got big baggage, bitch 
 Yeah I blow it by the zip, anywhere I go it's on the road on every trip 
 Ask my Nini, love her grandson but she know that I'm a trip 
 Got my habit from Ms. Peachy smoking roaches getting lit 
 Now I fill my blunts with so much weed they say "that all ain't gon' fit" 
 On some highly grown shit, with a Hollywood bitch 
 Got the sweetest purple kush in a precisely rolled spliff 
 High as John in Pulp Fic' on the way to see Marcellus 
 Girl I'm in another world, and Chevy got another twirl 
 For those who don't know he got that roll game 
 And I ain't gon' lie, he the reason why I got my roll game 
 I feel like I'm soul plane, I smoked the whole thang, pound or oz 
 Kush fiend, purple master OG
