Up in this bitch and we all faded 
 Fuck 'bout a bitch, no we don't save her 
 Nothin' to a boss, do my own thing 
 It's money over hoes, no I'm no stranger 
 Want more bounce, we got more ounces 
 Want more bounce, we got more ounces 
 Want more bounce, we got more ounces 
 Want more bounce, we got more ounces 
 Gin and drugs, gin and drugs 
 Gin and drugs, we got gin and drugs 
 Gin and drugs, gin and drugs 
 Gin and drugs, we got gin and drugs 
 We got 
 Only on Gin and them drugs, I walked in, in the club 
 About three of them, dawg I'm not kiddin' 
 When I tell you if you came with your bitch 
 Then it's the end of my car, push-start the engine 
 Let's start from the beginning 
 With a young nigga from the 'Burgh 
 Smokin' weed, gettin' money, fuck what you heard 
 Know they hate 'cause I'm flyer than I ever been 
 High off a medicine 
 Bitch bad, her ass fat, I'll probably let her in 
 Ball so fuckin' hard I need a letterman 
 Know a couple niggas that I'm better than 
 Pussy, I don't sweat it or the money 'cause I get it 
 Taylor Gang on top, just remember that I said it 
 Fuck this nigga bitch, grab my shit, then I jetted 
 Up in this bitch and we all faded 
 Fuck 'bout a bitch, no we don't save her 
 Nothin' to a boss, do my own thing 
 It's money over hoes, no I'm no stranger 
 Want more bounce, we got more ounces 
 Want more bounce, we got more ounces 
 Want more bounce, we got more ounces 
 Want more bounce, we got more ounces 
 Gin and drugs, gin and drugs 
 Gin and drugs, we got gin and drugs 
 Gin and drugs, gin and drugs 
 Gin and drugs, we got gin and drugs 
 We got! 
 Baby it's fuck day, who wanna bang? 
 Even though I had some, right 'fore I came 
 It's lit though! 
 Girl you ain't fuckin' what you here for? 
 Got at least 3 zips rolled, all ready 
 Wiz brought another jar with him 
 Gin and drugs got me feelin' like a car hit him 
 'Round 6 a.m once I hit my DM 
 Didn't have a rubber so she got to feel this skin 
 Money stacks stack high, bruh this don't bend 
 What's up with your friend? Biatch! 
 Ho, yeah-yeah-yeah 
 Feeling like Mitch when the light hit him 
 Married to the money, let the rice hit him 
 Up in this bitch and we all faded 
 Fuck 'bout a bitch, no we don't save her 
 Nothin' to a boss, do my own thing 
 It's money over hoes, no I'm no stranger 
 Want more bounce, we got more ounces 
 Want more bounce, we got more ounces 
 Want more bounce, we got more ounces 
 Want more bounce, we got more ounces 
 Gin and drugs, gin and drugs 
 Gin and drugs, we got gin and drugs 
 Gin and drugs, gin and drugs 
 Gin and drugs, we got gin and drugs 
 We got!
