Ah 
 That's just how the fuck it is 
 Fucking punk 
 It's fucking bosses over here man 
 Leave that shit to them little niggas, real talk 
 We out with it 
 Uh 
 Don't leave the door open 'cause we smokin'... 
 Proceed with caution when you approachin... 
 Jump in my ride, I'm getting ghost 
 Don't ever go no where without my bros... 
 Round the best, you get exposed 
 Them execs we ain't sweatin those 
 I'm in sweatpants looking for the remote 
 Rocking better clothes than the ones that was fly before us 
 When it come down to paper, I'm trynna get the highest portion 
 Pull out the old school just so I can slide the Porsche in 
 I worked hard for mine, French bulldogs all in the yard 
 Won't change course or fall off 
 Paid the cost to be the boss 
 When you the man you don't play your hand 
 You deal the cards 
 Me I'm owning the building and smoking weed in every room in it 
 Pulling up high as fuck to your event 
 Shirt open, my chains swanging 
 Don't rep the gang if you can't hang 
 (Wiz Talking) 
 It's simple as that... 
 Matter of fact the shit kinda complex... 
 So don't try this at home 
 Fuck around and learn something you young ass nigga 
 It's bigger than nino, we know 
 We the last generation that's worshipping Al Pacino 
 Seen it first hand in Casino 
 But nigga's gotta go down that road to find out 
 I smoked a couple j's I rolled a couple more fore' I'm out 
 You ever been to where I'm from you probably know 
 What I'm bout 
 Stay ready for the occasion 
 Time equals money that's the equation 
 You nigga's look funny trynna ride the wave 
 I hope that you crash 
 And nobody dive in and save you 
 They call it the game, watch how they play you 
 My life is a movie, you wanna stay through 
 Still think I'm the realest nigga to this day 
 Them other nigga's is hand made 
 Under pressure they break 
 I just do this for my gang's sake 
 I don't get time away 
 I'ma light this j 
 We don't stop hustling 
 Nah, never 
 We don't stop grinding 
 Hell naw 
 We don't stop going hard 
 Nope 
 Made a lot of paper but I got a long way to gooooooo 
 We don't stop hustling 
 Nah, never 
 We don't stop grinding 
 Hell naw 
 We don't stop going hard 
 Nope 
 Made a lot of paper but I got a long way to go 
 This is a really big performance for me like 
 This is something that I kinda take seriously 
 I love performing, I love being in front of people 
 Like the festival crowds are always dope 
 So it's just something that I not only look forward to 
 But I try and make sure I'm really prepared for 
 So I can go out there and just have the best show
