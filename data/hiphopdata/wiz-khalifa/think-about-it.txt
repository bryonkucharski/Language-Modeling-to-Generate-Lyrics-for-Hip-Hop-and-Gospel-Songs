Yeah 
 You know it's Naughty Boy and young Wiz Khalifa mane 
 Hotel Cabana, Taylor Gang. 
 Got me up all night 
 Used to start a fight 
 You don't wanna think about it 
 You drink about it 
 You smoke about it 
 Don't talk about it 
 Every night, the same 
 Who's the one to blame? 
 You don't wanna think about it 
 You drink about it 
 You smoke about it 
 Don't talk about it 
 Don't make me forget, sir 
 13's on my Impala, rock chrome filled with chronic smoke 
 Homie, I got game like the shuttles were fam 
 Milk these lames for what they worth 
 Puff [?] ashes on my shirt, three will motion all you motherfuckers 
 The Porsche in the garage then got a life for my dogs 
 I had nothing at all but now I take trips to Vegas 
 Roll up, playing songs on my oldies playlist 
 Diamonds on my fist, Rollie on my wrist, my life's the shit 
 Got me up all night 
 Used to start a fight 
 You don't wanna think about it 
 You drink about it 
 You smoke about it 
 Don't talk about it 
 Every night, the same 
 Who's the one to blame? 
 You don't wanna think about it 
 You drink about it 
 You smoke about it 
 Don't talk about it 
 Don't make me forget, sir 
 Standing over the terrace, made so much last year 
 These lil' niggas should be embarrassed 
 Claim we the same, but the difference is apparent 
 Copy my style so much they got me like 'where the fuck is their parents?' 
 Smoking so much that they probably think it's scary 
 But I don't give a fuck, I'm rolling another one up 
 And giving middle fingers to you little fucks 
 You get on lying and say I syck, all time you rolling paper and wearing chucks 
 And I ain't even had my best year, ten cars, 20 millions, fuck I'mma do next year? 
 Got me up all night 
 Used to start a fight 
 You don't wanna think about it 
 You drink about it 
 You smoke about it 
 Don't talk about it 
 Every night, the same 
 Who's the one to blame? 
 You don't wanna think about it 
 You drink about it 
 You smoke about it 
 Don't talk about it 
 Don't make me forget, sir
