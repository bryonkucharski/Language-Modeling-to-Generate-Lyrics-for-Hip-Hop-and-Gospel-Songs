We blowin' money bitch 
 I go hard, I go hard, gettin' paid 
 I go hard, I go hard, gettin' paid 
 We don't even count the money no more we just blow it 
 (We spend it all up) 
 We don't even count the money no more we just throw it 
 And make 'em pick it all up 
 Money strapped to my waist 
 Somewhere in the whip I'm in with no bass 
 Flooded the trap I need a new place? 
 Money got to go I told 'em there's no space 
 Never love hoes, hoes I don't chase 
 Only wear loc's the same as my race 
 All I know is stunt, make a hater feel like shit to the point 
 That he in another place? Real talk 
 I-I-I ain't the one but I lean on haters, looking so clean on gator 
 Try to jack me, I guarantee I'll put the beam on haters 
 Hood nigga, when I come to this I'm stocked up 
 Shit on my wrist tryna light this block up 
 Nigga said I got a dope man swag, take a look at these jewels 
 Every one of 'em rocked up 
 And we still on the corner packed in 
 Ace town president somethin' back then 
 Hope the slut that I'm with got insurance so 
 She know I'm about to run up on her back end 
 Like I set of bad, she was gettin' plugged 
 Can take it to the streets, take it to the club 
 I don't rubber band shit I got trash bags 
 Niggas make it rain, I'ma make it flood 
 I ain't gonna talk shit I'ma talk bread 
 I f a hater don't like it, tell 'em drop dead 
 I'm in the hood like a fresh set of projects 
 Where they either rock blue or they rock red 
 I'm the king of the streets 
 Ain't nobody finna take away what I came to get 
 Audi R8 that I came is sick, with interior the color of a all white? 
 We don't even count the money no more we just blow it 
 (We spend it all up) 
 We don't even count the money no more we just throw it 
 (And make 'em pick it all up) 
 We don't even count the money no more we just blow it 
 (We spend it all up) 
 We don't even count the money no more we just throw it 
 (And make 'em pick it all up) 
 Big weed in my joint, diss me there's no point 
 Lil guy but still all my n-ggas got big heat they on point 
 Rollin' up while I drive, engine be in the trunk 
 Decided in 2005 that I can fuck any bitch that I want 
 Ooh, and, and and I ain't trying to stunt 
 This a two seater my bitch can't help but ride up in the front 
 Ballin' most n-ggas wont try to pick 'em up 
 Throwin' so much money you even try to pick some up 
 You tryin' different stuff look at how I block 'em out 
 Smoke like a Cali nigga even when I'm in the south 
 And when when my car come out the whores come out 
 Don't even get on twitter no more 
 'Cause I'm what your bitch talkin' 'bout 
 We don't even count the money no more we just blow it 
 (We spend it all up) 
 We don't even count the money no more we just throw it 
 (And make 'em pick it all up) 
 We don't even count the money no more we just blow it 
 (We spend it all up) 
 We don't even count the money no more we just throw it 
 (And make 'em pick it all up)
