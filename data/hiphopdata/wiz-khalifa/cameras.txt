Um, it's hardly a secret 
 You ain't gon stop tryna get where you going until you reach it 
 Always had them bars back in the day 
 When the same ones running up on you wasn't speaking 
 Look at all your achievements 
 You work hard so it'd be kinda hard not to believe that 
 You party every weekend (weekend) 
 Fuck 'em all who act like they ain't see it then 
 All them nights on the plane 
 Buses nigga too, had to charge it to the game 
 Always wanted stardom 'n' the fame 
 Learn to out smart em 
 And now it ain't no stopping the champagne from poppin' 
 The draws from droppin' 
 Us seeing muscle cars and coppin' em 
 Started off just a little less popular 
 Now you got a new place 
 You drive a new car 
 You smile for cameras than life like a superstar 
 Don't care what they say 
 You reach for the stars 
 Got everything you always dreamed or thought about 
 And everyone knows who you are 
 Never gets boring 
 And haters in your face you just ignore 'em 
 Don't know what they talking shit for 
 Seems niggas get there's you just tryna get yours 
 Therefore, you left all the people you care for 
 Hopped on a plane and got airborn 
 Seen all the bullshit and fell for it 
 But it's all good now 
 Cause the same ones that talk shit telling everyone you made it 
 Then you start seein' hoes you dated 
 Then thoughts started getting jaded 
 Now your life's sort of different ain't it 
 Feel your scars knowin' what your pain is 
 But what's it all worth if its painless 
 Say you wanna be famous 
 Now you got a new place 
 You drive a new car 
 You stop all the cameras than life like a superstar 
 Don't care what they say 
 You reach for the stars 
 Got everything you always dreamed or thought about 
 And everyone knows who you are 
 Are, are, are, are, are, are, are, 
 Are, are, are, are, are, are, are, 
 Who you are 
 Are, are, are, are, are, are, are, 
 Are, are, are, are, are, are, are 
 Who you are 
 Always knew I was this good 
 But never knew I'd be this good 
 Them niggas just startin' I've been doing it 
 Hear 'em talk but they ain't living my life 
 In the dark tryna get in my life 
 But chances I don't 'em, dodge twice 
 Spendin' grands for hoes, this is the high life 
 And for the camera's posing this the high life 
 Bottles raising for my niggas not here 
 I pour out a couple sips 
 Blew 'em on the beach, I smoke for you on my trips 
 Them days I was younger I knew this life was the shit 
 But never like this 
 It's so amazing, we ain't gotta duck shots 
 We just pour and chase 'em 
 Ain't worry 'bout it, 'cause they gon hate 
 Know where I'm going, look where I came from
