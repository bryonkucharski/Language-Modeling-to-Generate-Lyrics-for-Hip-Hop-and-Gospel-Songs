Baby I go, hard 
 So hard, sometimes it's hard to tell whether not I'm even on my job 
 Most of the time I'm running 'round, either that or I'm gone 
 Some of these people hating, but we don't see 'em at all 
 'Cause we done made it, too far 
 Got something to say then fuck 'em 
 Ain't trying to lose out on all of this for nothing 
 I'm usually just balling and shit, whatever I want, I'mma get 
 No time to count the money that I got because all of it's getting spent 
 And all of my niggas grind so all of us getting rich 
 And most of these niggas fly but all of 'em ain't the shit 
 That's why you holding me down, been doing it ever since 
 Only one I wanna be 'round and counting up all these chips... wit' 
 Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it 
 Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it 
 I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me 
 Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it 
 Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it 
 Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it 
 I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me 
 Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it 
 And I, swear you deserve a wedding ring 
 Can't ever see you choosing nothing over instead of me 
 Won't ever leave you, you're the one I need so that's how I'm gonna treat you 
 Take you places where they using different language to greet you 
 Smile and shake when they meet you 
 Lot of cake but you got a lot of love from me and when I'm home, you can't get enough of me 
 Cause even when we both tired, you still put up with me 
 Ain't going nowhere for sure, feel like you stuck with me 
 Swear I feel lucky, I get anything I want 
 And if I need it then you got it, if I say it then you trust me 
 Don't see you much but when I do, I need your love and I'mma need it in a rush 
 Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it 
 Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it 
 I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me 
 Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it 
 Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it 
 Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it 
 I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me 
 Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it 
 Baby I can't break you heart, make you wait no more 
 Anytime you need me, I'll be right there for sure 
 You don't even have to call me, just say my name 
 I'll be right there waiting for you 
 Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it 
 Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it 
 I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me 
 Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it 
 Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it 
 Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it 
 I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me 
 Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it 
 Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it 
 Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it 
 I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me 
 Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it 
 Whatever you want boy, I got it, got it 
 Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it 
 I'm everywhere you be, I can't see you without me 
 Got everything you need, ain't no doubt about it
