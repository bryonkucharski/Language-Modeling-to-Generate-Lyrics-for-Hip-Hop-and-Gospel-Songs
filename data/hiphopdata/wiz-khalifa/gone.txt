Yeah, it's young, ya know? 
 Crack that shit down 
 Roll that shit up, light that shit, pass it 
 Nah, fuck that, face this one, yeah 
 This for all my true weed smokers 
 Yeah, nigga ask me what's wrong with me? 
 I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank 
 (That sticky, that icky, that sticky, that icky, that sticky, that icky) 
 Purple, purple in my pocket and my jeans sag low 
 I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank 
 (That sticky, that icky, that sticky, that icky, that sticky, that icky) 
 Purple, purple in my pocket and my jeans sag low 
 I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank 
 Ridin' in my ride, so blowed, don't how to think 
 But I'm stayin' high 
 I'ma roll me a nice, long Swisher, filled with light green 
 Oh, I think they like me, let me get a light, B 
 (And then I'm gone) 
 Off that Cali bud, what the fuck you chokin' on? 
 Mr. Bud by the Zone, O's like Omarion 
 And we ain't tuckin' nothin' cousin, what's the hold up? 
 Keep 'em comin' back to back to back, we roll up 
 (Till it's all gone) 
 Get a pound, break it down 
 I ain't stingy, it's enough to go around 
 And I'm blazin' right now, niggas tellin' me to hold on 
 Crank it, twist it, light it, take a pull and hold on 
 (And then, I'm gone) 
 I gotta have it, gotta have it, that's unheard about 
 Rollin' up another blunt, before I put the first one out 
 My eyes low, have me chiefin' till I choke 
 Niggas askin' me what's wrong 
 Blew some smoke up out my nose and said I'm gone 
 I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank 
 (That sticky, that icky, that sticky, that icky, that sticky, that icky) 
 Purple, purple in my pocket and my jeans sag low 
 I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank 
 (That sticky, that icky, that sticky, that icky, that sticky, that icky) 
 Purple, purple in my pocket and my jeans sag low 
 I said, I'm gone off that brownish drank 
 Niggas know how I roll, it look like my eyes closed 
 Hennessey and Hydro, rhyme slow 
 Nigga, I'm on a different type of a vibe 
 This a different type of weed 
 And I'm a different type a high 
 (My nigga, I'm gone) 
 To a place that you probably never been in life 
 Smokin' Purple Kryptonite 
 Make sure you curl that Swisher right 
 'Cause I ain't tryna have this home grown runnin' 
 Homie thinkin' he gon' smoke for free 
 I duck 'em, roll somethin' 
 (Then, I'm gone) 
 In my ride, doin' 80 in a 45 Zone, half a zone 
 Got me blown, I get more than high 
 Fresh off of the plane 
 Head start into my hotel 
 Weed man in every city, yeah, I smoke well 
 (Even when I'm gone) 
 I ain't the only one, all my niggas puff pounds 
 Swingin' blunts 'round, sun up till sun down 
 My eyes low and my words are getting slow 
 Niggas askin' me what's wrong 
 I blew some smoke up out my nose and said, I'm gone 
 I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank 
 (That sticky, that icky, that sticky, that icky, that sticky, that icky) 
 Purple, purple in my pocket and my jeans sag low 
 I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank 
 (That sticky, that icky, that sticky, that icky, that sticky, that icky) 
 Purple, purple in my pocket and my jeans sag low
