Niggas talking like they stunting 
 But real niggas ain't stupid 
 Who you think you fooling 
 You gon' have to come prove it 
 You know me I'm a OG 
 I don't say it unless I do it 
 Got a pistol off in my 550 nigga don't make me use it 
 You rap niggas is clueless 
 Getting money is my duty 
 And if the truth is really naked then Juicy J's a nudist 
 Your girlfriends my groupie if I speak to her she gonna lose it 
 Fuck nigga you mad? I don't give a fuck, sue me 
 A hundred deep we all strapped 
 Pistols all on our waistline 
 Real niggas don't talk about it we shoot it out in the daytime 
 In the streets you really not 
 Extended clip I won't miss a shot 
 Try me I'll put you in a pine box 
 My trigger finger got the chicken pox 
 Got money I got hoes, getting head in my drop Rolls 
 All these chickens and all this syrup you would think we at Roscoe's 
 I'm smoking and I'm driving while I'm rolling up 
 You broke so I smoke enough for both of us 
 Niggas don't play with me, these niggas know better 
 These niggas know better, these niggas know 
 These bitches don't play with me, these bitches know better 
 These bitches know better, these bitches know 
 These niggas don't play with me, these niggas know better 
 These niggas know better, these niggas know 
 These bitches don't play with me, these bitches know better 
 These bitches know better, these bitches know 
 Yeah bitch, fuck you know about that 
 Taylor Gang, do more in a hour than you do in a day 
 Smoke and drink as much as we really talk about 
 Talking shit but they know better 
 Talking kush but I grow better 
 Talking money my dough better 
 All my niggas rep mafia 
 Talking borders we crossing those 
 Talking pounds we got lots of those 
 Million dollars that's independent 
 Look at us say those niggas getting it 
 Niggas don't play with me 
 They know I got a couple niggas that'll spray for me 
 They know that if it come down to it that I'll pay the cost 
 Before you say your ready for war be prepared to take a loss, Bitch I'm a boss 
 I be rolling up that good, nigga 
 I keep both hands clean 
 Might be my goons that's on the crime scene 
 Throwing their gang up when they approach 
 Don't even talk bank 'cause you know its bigger 
 Ain't in first class 'cause I'm the only nigga 
 Niggas don't play with me, these niggas know better 
 These niggas know better, these niggas know 
 These bitches don't play with me, these bitches know better 
 These bitches know better, these bitches know 
 These niggas don't play with me, these niggas know better 
 These niggas know better, these niggas know 
 These bitches don't play with me, these bitches know better 
 These bitches know better, these bitches know
