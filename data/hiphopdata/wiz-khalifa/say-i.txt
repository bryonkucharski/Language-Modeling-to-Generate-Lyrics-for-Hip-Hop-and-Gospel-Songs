All in favor of giving ripped and gone 
 And you're gonna have to call someone to drive you home 
 Say I I I I I I I 
 All in favor of getting super high 
 You might start to feel like a bird that can fly 
 Say I I I I I I I 
 Brought me in and watch me go, bad on a hoe ass nigga 
 Don't give me no more I'm on my second fifth of liquor 
 Once I'm power up it's hard for me to power down 
 I fuck a nigga up, and put tears on 'em like a clown 
 I went from rags to riches, riches to rags, 
 Top convertibles, Benzs and Jags 
 Smoking me herbal, sipping me wine, 
 Or should I say turbo 'cause it's green and it's lime 
 Ever since he was infant he was raised around pimps 
 When he took his first step, he walked with a limp 
 Man this nigga hard headed damn fool 
 His teacher sucked his dick in high school 
 Supercalifragilistic ex be ala hooligan 
 Breakin down the diesel mixing cookies with the headband 
 Went to jail on a Friday, didn't get out till Tuesday 
 Got a DUI for drinking too much lou, bitch 
 I. Got a DUI, why? I didn't even have to drive 
 Now, I'm in jail for a crime, made bail and I paid the fine 
 My lawyer charged me high ass prices, 
 DNV, bout to take my license 
 Insurance, is going up, and when I go to court I know I'm fucked 
 All this shit, just for drinking 
 Need a designated driver, I'm to drunk for thinking 
 Two hands on the steering wheel 
 Don't let a friend drink and drive if you being real 
 Might crash the whip, might lose your life 
 If I get too high tonight just make sure 
 I making home safe and you do the same 
 Now let's get fucked up and lose it man, bitch 
 Roll the paper so loud I wake up the neighbors 
 The boss I don't need no favor 
 You pussy so fuck a hater bitch 
 Now that my cake up, my crib got an elevator, 
 My new shoes is alligator 
 And ever meal got a waiter with it 
 And I'm all about pour drank up 
 While I'm rolling the stank up 
 Sweat my wife out her make up, 
 Blow a pound when I wake up, 
 See the cars they don't wanna race us 
 I do it big niggas do it A Cup 
 Walk up in the club then gonna bring some champagne 
 I'm a blow a lot of drugs, I put money on it, 
 Spendin all this bank let a fuck nigga hate 
 Real nigga show love sound funny don't it 
 All this money think I lucked up, 
 All this Gin got me fucked up 
 Man I live life the Taylor way 
 Drinking Bombay and lemonade, rolling up some paper planes.
