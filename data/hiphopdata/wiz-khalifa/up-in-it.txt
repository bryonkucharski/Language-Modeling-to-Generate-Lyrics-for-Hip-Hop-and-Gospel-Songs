Damn, we back in business 
 Uh, wakin' up the neighbors, you could hear the headboard shakin' 
 I'll leave all of your body parts achin' 
 Speedin' up the pace while I look right into your face 
 You tell me that's that good shit you're tastin' 
 And I know you like it from the side 
 But tonight I'mma just unwind and let you ride and watch you take it 
 'Cause I'm tryin' to get you so wet, I mean so wet 
 If there's a record for this shit then I'mma break it 
 It's goin' down no matter the place or time I call 
 I got enough space 
 Think anything you think you want, no prob I got enough cake 
 All up in it in the mornin', knowin' damn well that I had you up late 
 Ain't buyin' it you ain't spendin' it, you keep throwin' it back so I'm givin' it 
 You love when I get up in it 
 You love when I get, you love when I get 
 You love when I get, you love when I get 
 You love when I get, you love when I get 
 You love when I get, you love when I get 
 Wake up when I bake up that's just somethin' that I do 
 Pick your favorite sex scene, that's what I'm gon' do to you 
 Up in your bed's where you probably belong 
 Givin' you all that I got till it's gone 
 Sexy as fuck you still got them heels on 
 Favorite position, we tryin' them all 
 Once I get in can't get out of my zone 
 Fuck you so good you won't pick up your phone 
 And when your girlfriends or whoever do call 
 You fuckin' with me so you tell 'em you gone 
 You don't smoke so I break it down, you roll it up 
 You poke it out, your face down so I hold it up 
 You don't give a shit that my money so big I can't fold it up 
 Plus I ain't tired till you finish, this ain't a race but I'm winnin' 
 You love when I get up in it 
 You love when I get, you love when I get 
 You love when I get, you love when I get 
 You love when I get, you love when I get 
 You love when I get, you love when I get 
 You don't even gotta name a place where we can go 
 'Cause we already goin', goin', goin' 
 Don't nobody gotta ask or even got to know 
 Baby we already goin', goin', goin' 
 You love when I get up in it 
 You love when I get, you love when I get 
 You love when I get, you love when I get 
 You love when I get, you love when I get 
 You love when I get, you love when I get
