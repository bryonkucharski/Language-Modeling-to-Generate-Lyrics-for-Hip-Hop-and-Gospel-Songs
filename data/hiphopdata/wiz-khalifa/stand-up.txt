Listen, I came in the game feet first 
 Hit the ground runnin', a hustler till I meet dirt 
 Gotta be consumption I'm pumpin, the people need work 
 Love the niggas frontin I came from nothin' and seen worse 
 The long-armed khalifa reachin' with each verse 
 I got that food for your thought, plus what the streets thirst 
 And you can ask around the haters'll know, 
 I'm tame with the flow, I'm sorta like the jaeger and blow 
 I see the dream like a martin luther, I preach to the constitution in peace, 
 But violate it, get that ass annihilated 
 I'm on the grind, money is time so why waste it 
 And everything but my piss clean, I'm high maintenance 
 You niggas are weak, sweet like one of them now-and-laters 
 The canon blast your candy ass if you try and hate it, 
 I made it, 'cause I stayed a couple steps ahead of y'all and 
 A hundred percent, since benji got the bread involved I'm, 
 Lovin' this shit, come fuck with the prince, 
 I'm leavin' heads hollowed like them things stuffed in the clips 
 And the streets gon' remember this cat name, I'm beatin' the rap game 
 Just like nigga huggin the strip (why?) 
 Cause that's how a hustler do, fall back I don't fuck with you, 
 We make it happen the clappin know we can scrum with you 
 Yeah we can take it to the heads, give you a lump or two 
 A fool is still, team bring heat like a oven dude 
 (Chorus x2) ladies stand up, gentlemen stand up, 
 This is pure skill, far from damned luck, 
 You gotta make a plan to never give your man up 
 And man up, to positively stand up 
 Once again the youngest sin came to drop the hammer 
 How could a bystander feel that this is not bananas? 
 We earn stripes, you all hype in that propaganda, 
 Gats spot, you cats shot, but not from cameras, 
 Back glock, cause snap shots'll stop your plan up, 
 Stuck in my ways, the haze taste like tropicana, 
 Thinkin' the days of way back, people will say that, 
 The youngin was gifted sick when he stayed back 
 Now the people listenin play back, I got it made 
 Obligated to gettin' passin grades and blaze tracks, 
 You'll be amazed at how I make units move 
 Self-made, twelfth grade, boy I'll take you to school 
 I'm through the streets of pistolvania where my goonies move, 
 (??????) Can't miss these trucks with the rims on them 
 And you can find me speedin, listenin to big and em, 
 Fresh outta class with the weed tucked in my timberlands
