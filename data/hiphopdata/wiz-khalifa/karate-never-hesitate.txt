Cup full of gin, now we're huntin' her friend 
 I might fuck once, but I never ever call again 
 Fucked your bitch in my van, slapped the shit up out yo' man 
 Fuck the police, I go Ham 
 Hit her from the back like, "Damn" 
 Damn How you get all that? 
 All that OG in my joint, how you hit all that? 
 I be always movin' forward, I ain't never movin' backwards 
 Natural with the talent, I don't ever have to practice 
 And since we talkin' practice bitch, I'm ballin' just like Iverson 
 My new bitch immaculate and I'm so used to traffickin' 
 I be with the baddest bitch and best believe I'm stabbin' it 
 I hit her with the magic stick, my car could do a magic trick 
 You can't lock me down baby, let me live my life 
 Whip a four into a six, 'cause baby I'm not nice 
 Ay, you ain't bossed up nigga, you can't change that price 
 Tried to short me, got him on the phone like, "Make that right" 
 Got a plane to catch, we can only fuck for 30 minutes 
 Say she got a man, but she say she love me when I'm in it 
 I'm a real nigga, scratch my tattoos when I hit it 
 Fuck her real good, make her call a Uber when I'm finished 
 That's my nigga Chev, I get to the bag 
 (?), yo' bitch give me head 
 Like, "Ooh ", ooh she smart 
 This a spaceship, this a robot, watch it park 
 Cup full of gin, now we're huntin' her friend 
 I might fuck once, but I never ever call again 
 Fucked your bitch in my van, slapped the shit up out yo' man 
 Fuck the police, I go HAM 
 Hit her from the back like, "Damn", (ooh) 
 I can see the plot (ooh) 
 Ooh, I just bagged a thot (ooh) 
 Diamonds, they be dancing macarena in my watch 
 Sippin' (?), servin' Legos baby, you know I have blocks, ay 
 Mother-fuck the neighbours, they was wishin' that it stop, woo 
 Gun in my crib and we gettin' it André 
 Gettin' them Benjamins all day 
 No I ain't payin' attention, my charm is a artist, my chain a magician 
 Pourin' and drinkin', I'm sippin', (?) and I'm finished 
 And my bitch bad like Dennis the Menace, I gave her the business 
 I just fucked your baby mama, ooh boy, you the enemy 
 Text and said she sick and need the dick, she want the remedy 
 I just want the headshot, I just want the Kennedy 
 Got to rappin' like I'm Wopo, don't know what got into me 
 Cup full of gin, now we're huntin' her friend 
 I might fuck once, but I never ever call again 
 Fucked your bitch in my van, slapped the shit up out yo' man 
 Fuck the police, I go HAM 
 Hit her from the back like, "Damn" 
 And I'm with some gangstas, gangstas 
 And I'm with some gangstas 
 Uh, heaven and glory 
 She so high tellin' me stories 
 Puttin' on for the G's before me 
 We the motherfucking gang, Army, Navy, Air Force 
 Blowin' KK got me airborne 
 Gettin' comfortable's what I'm here for 
 Confidence in my approach, the fans wanna hear more 
 Therefore, I built this whole belief that I'ma stand on the foundation, that's real 
 Smokin' on (?) the bill 
 Chill, as my driver turns the wheel 
 Rollin' papers, never let the paper stand still 
 I'm on a mission and I can, will 
 Eliminate the competition to destroy the enemy, just gotta break the image 
 How do I anticipate 
 What I need in my relationship with you 
 How do I never hesitate 
 When I'm afraid and don't understand what to do 
 Got your nigga emotional 
 Goin' through his feelings 
 Never fit in but always manage to get my dividends 
 We at the crib, bring your friends 
 I could show you how I live 
 Say you want to fuck but it depends 
 I met her at Penn, sleep them (?) 
 Hardly ever call them again 
 Sweetest bitch, call her Harley Quinn 
 Nigga, your squad hardly win 
 (?) call them hoes fallin' in 
 They cheerin' for the kid 'cause I'm ballin' 
 Winter, spring, summer, fall, I just want it all 
 Got a joint rolled for each and every one of y'all 
 All my clothes is recent, all my hoes is decent 
 Can't join us or beat us 
 How do I anticipate 
 What I need in my relationship with you 
 How do I never hesitate 
 When I'm afraid and don't understand what to do 
 Got you rollin' papers, got you rollin' papers 
 Pullin' up to Ubers, wakin' up the neighbours 
 Got you rollin' papers, got you rollin' papers 
 Got you rollin' papers, got you rollin' papers 
 Fallin' asleep, wakin' up days later 
 Huh-huh-huh-huh 
 Ain't it ain't about the clout man 
 It's about getting paid and smokin' up 
 That's what we about 
 Hah-hah-hah-hah
