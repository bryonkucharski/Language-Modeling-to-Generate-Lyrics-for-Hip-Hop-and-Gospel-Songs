[Wiz Khalifa] 
 Thousand pounds of weed 
 Riding in my car so fast I won't turn down the speed 
 Them hoes don't use they feet no more, they break down to their knees 
 And suck me like a king 
 Rose in my champagne glass and diamonds in my ring 
 Uh, roll some, that's your bitch on my dick, I might let her hold something 
 You niggas smoking sevens Imma need a whole onion, whole youngin, oh 
 Same ones that hate, same ones that tag along 
 No Blackberry, too many lame niggas call my phone 
 Call me world wide Wiz 'cause I'm never home 
 Ever leave me round your bitch I'mma get her stoned 
 And you know that, I rock camos and throwbacks 
 And go download some of my old track and go play somewhere there's hoes at 
 Fucking high, and you down there where them lows at 
 Gettin' tired of hearing my flow jacked go head hand me a joint you can't roll that 
 I got a whole lot of hochie, and I'm rolling up for anyone in here that knows me 
 Everybody smoking, yeaaaaaaaaa it's a party, oh, it's a party 
 Everybody smoking papers, nobody smoking blunts 
 Bitches rolling weed and my niggas fucked up 
 Yeaaaaaaaaa it's a party, oh, it's a party 
 [Chevy Woods] 
 Quarter pound of that sour, that's four days on tour 
 Sleeping on how we smoke, see all these pillows on this floor 
 Every state we score, fill those papers they be raw 
 Look like a piece of chalk in my hand but I ain't writing on the chalkboard 
 And I heard it's a party, it's a party it's a party but I'm cool 
 Them niggas smoking garbage, I'm no fool 
 We give 5 j's out half zips? Nigga that's really smoking 
 Ain't enough weed up in that swisha to get you high, you joking 
 Niggas claim that they be high, they be hella low 
 When they gang up in the building you gon' smell that sour smoke 
 I could get that shit from my backyard, go pick it out myself 
 Yellow light let me slow it down, niggas need some help 
 28 ain't enough you need more 
 All this weed over here, that's 1 weed jar 
 When them planes get the flying, niggas wanna part 
 Smoking crash with the plane, Amelia Earhart 
 [Neako] 
 What I smoke in one day, these niggas don't smoke in one week 
 Riding round and its just me, Pepsi can, playing that Bun B 
 Gotta smoke that dope on the run with me, comfortably, I'm smoking weed 
 Doing speeds, who with me, probably a chick from TMZ 
 I make her roll like two or three, let her smoke and feel the breeze 
 Y'all chip in on a half a zip, counting grams, saving weed 
 Average shit, it was us just smoking out in NY 
 Swear to GOD we let ten fly, that's ten planes with ten guys 
 Nine smoke, meaning someone left without his mind pot 
 Planes Continental, flights nonstop 
 You get some zips, well get some P's 
 Smoke your spliffs and ragged bitch tell me how does she breath 
 Perfect planes, we call them G6â²s 
 And its just me chilling, me and three bitches 
 Rolling up its cool, come take this bong rip 
 Pack this bold straight dope, make your lungs rip
