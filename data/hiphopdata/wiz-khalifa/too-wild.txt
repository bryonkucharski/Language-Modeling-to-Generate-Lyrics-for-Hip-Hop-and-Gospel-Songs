Late nights, everyday is a motherfuckin' party 
 Too stoned, don't know what I did last night 
 Hangin' with my niggas gettin' drunk 
 Smokin' weed and doin' what we want 
 We live our lives 
 And ain't no one gon' bring us down 
 Staying out, sleeping when we can 
 'Cause we don't stop 
 Going hard, wake up in the morning 
 Do it all again! 
 Roll up the Marley, let's get it started 
 Life of a party! 
 Let's live for today, we might not be here tomorrow 
 And they say I'm too wild 
 They said I'm too fun 
 They say it's too much 
 But too much ain't nothin' at all! 
 'Cause we just want more, (more) 
 We just want more,(more) 
 Every time I hear the music 
 I go crazy 
 Floating there you take me away 
 Higher we've ever been before 
 Take me to the clouds 
 Take me to the clouds 
 Take me to the clouds 
 Take me to the clouds 
 Every time I hit the club 
 I take my money, I spend it all 
 Standing on the couch just showing love 
 Don't give a damn 
 Don't give a fuck 
 Float me and take me away 
 High up in the clouds, never coming down 
 Somewhere out the space, never on the ground 
 Always turning up, never turning down 
 Another hundred grands 
 As soon as I turn around 
 Take me up to where I wanna be 
 Tired as fuck, but we don't wanna sleep 
 Mary Jane and them paper planes 
 Pouring shots, you better take this drink 
 And they say I'm too wild 
 They said I'm too fun 
 They say it's too much 
 But too much ain't nothin' at all! 
 'Cause we just want more, (more) 
 We just want more, (more) 
 They say I'm too wild 
 They said I'm too fun 
 They say it's too much 
 But too much ain't nothin' at all! 
 'Cause we just want more, (more) 
 We just want more, (more)
