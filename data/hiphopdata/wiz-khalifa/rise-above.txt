Uh, you would have thought that from seeing me going hard 
 That that'd motivate these motherfuckers to get on they job 
 But instead they hating on what I've been doing 
 Having conversations in my face about what I should do for 'em 
 What I'mma do keep rolling and dropping weed on 'em 
 Pack my bags look like I'm staying for weeks but be gone in the morning 
 If the flight is private, we probably should board it 
 You see it you like it, I can probably afford it 
 If niggas really felt some type of way about the shit I'm doing 
 You picked a crazy time to start letting me know 
 Cause jealousy and envy that's a trait for mostly bitches 
 Not a man so you ain't one if you letting it show 
 Now the money like the weed how we letting it grow 
 And I ain't holding on to shit I'm letting it go 
 Started small but now we all in them bigger game 
 All in a bigger plane, ballin' and getting paid 
 First the love was there 
 Then the paper came 
 Then the haters came 
 But we still rise above 
 But we still rise above 
 My phone is dead, but I got a contact 
 My sharpie paint pen on my Timbo combats 
 You talk shit, I won't respond back 
 What they gon' get, and you don't want that 
 That nigga will forget the deal 
 Remember what? get for real 
 My whip appeal, my crib is real 
 My wrist as well you know... the Richard Mille 
 And my grunge nigga, I make her come quicker 
 Then rock toe socks, yellow sponge nigga 
 I Tebow, for hoes that eat hoes 
 Emojis fo' me and my people 
 The hoes love me, I'm on they TiVo 
 I work they thighs, and they kegels 
 Skateboard, I love Chanel 
 Retweet me bitch, I'm Pharrell 
 First the love was there 
 Then the paper came 
 Then the haters came 
 But we still rise above 
 But we still rise above 
 Yeah, I hustle no muscle 
 I'll never be muzzled 
 I'm a piece to a puzzle 
 I'm Robert Townsend and my words gon' Hollywood Shuffle 
 My nigga I move moo, my motivation is moves foo' 
 I get up and does do, I evenly do ten things at once 
 Multitaskin' super fast and king of tattin' super pimpin' 
 House of rollin' run a business while I'm tourin' on you bitches 
 Doing features while watching a double feature nigga 
 I see you suffering from haterism, get that check 
 I take nothin' and make somethin' there's no breaks when the hustle's runnin' 
 Ain't dealin' with fakes ain't fuckin' with snakes 
 They all in my face now they got what it takes my nigga I'm straight 
 So don't reach out 'cause I peaced out when I reached out 
 There's no response like knockin' on an empty house 
 Yeah, so I keep on while you peep on what I be on and you're behind 
 That's what karma's about 
 First the love was there 
 Then the paper came 
 Then the haters came 
 But we still rise above 
 But we still rise above 
 Man what the fuck is wrong with these niggas 
 They rollin' up, let alone doin' a song with these niggas 
 Claimin' they ballin', to me they playin' 
 These niggas ain't really doin' what they sayin' 
 Man what the fuck is wrong with these niggas 
 They rollin' up, let alone doin' a song with these niggas 
 Claimin' they ballin', to me they playin' 
 These niggas ain't really doin' what they sayin'
