Way before your time the world knew this would happen 
 Was destiny to many, was just hard work for you 
 As you were brought into this world 
 You tried to find out about your surroundings 
 The people, the feeling of being alive and breathing the air 
 The smiles you see at that point are the ones you should always remember 
 Authentic is due to the choices you make for yourself 
 It'll be a bunch of fake smiles so easy to forget 
 But some although not healthy for them will create an understanding of what the word real means 
 Us and never as one of your greatest attributes 
 Others before thyself as long as long as thyself is taken care of is well being 
 And money, well, I know you know how to get money 
 I'm gonna say this one time only, live young man, you deserve it 
 Let's celebrate, Blacc Hollywood 
 And we be in the club, buying all our champagne 
 Spillin' it on the couches 
 Me and my niggas deserve this shit 
 We was there for the come up 
 I am Blacc Hollywood, I live Blacc Hollywood 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Hope you got thousands in your pocket 'cause she ain't lookin' for love 
 Hope you pop a lot of bottles 'cause she ain't lookin' for love 
 Hope you drive the newest car because she ain't lookin' for love 
 Hope you brought a lot of drugs because she ain't lookin' for love 
 That's no love 
 That's no love 
 That's no love 
 That's no love 
 Hope you got thousands in your pocket 'cause she ain't lookin' for love 
 Hope you pop a lot of bottles 'cause she ain't lookin' for love 
 Pull up to the club with my thugs smokin' so strong 
 Hop out and walk through the back, so high I don't know where I'm at 
 Them bitches get open, I'm with some niggas who all 'bout that action 
 Poppin' them bottles, you look outside, see them foreigns 
 She get them dollars out them niggas 'cause she ain't lookin' for love 
 Smoke that loud up by the pound, she get champagne and drink it up 
 Hope you ain't a Captain Savior 'cause she ain't lookin' for cuffs 
 In the club spinnin' face, she in your face, you think it's love 
 Said you throwin' dubs, bro that ain't enough 
 Money, clothes, and drugs, that's what bitches love 
 Rollie cold as fuck, that's what bitches love 
 Back to the topic, pop that ass and please don't stop it 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Hope you got thousands in your pocket 'cause she ain't lookin' for love 
 Hope you pop a lot of bottles 'cause she ain't lookin' for love 
 Hope you drive the newest car because she ain't lookin' for love 
 Hope you brought a lot of drugs because she ain't lookin' for love 
 That's no love 
 That's no love 
 That's no love 
 That's no love 
 Hope you got thousands in your pocket 'cause she ain't lookin' for love 
 Hope you pop a lot of bottles 'cause she ain't lookin' for love 
 That's no love, that's no love 
 That's your bitch, get her bed in my truck 
 You ain't give her what she needed, and she ain't lookin' for love 
 Homie she don't want no flowers, only make her cum 
 Poppin' ass, kinda naughty, met her ass at the party 
 Took her to the after party, drink some gin off her body 
 Spend some ends, now I'm going in 
 Took her and her friend, hit the skins 
 Then we smoked again, eyes like I'm Korean 
 Shots of gin, that's what all this juice is for 
 In Blacc Hollywood, that's my newest car 
 I'm like eney meeney, I got plenty 
 Pockets filled with hundreds, fifties 
 Nothin' lower, come fuck with a stoner and get stoned 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Hope you got thousands in your pocket 'cause she ain't lookin' for love 
 Hope you pop a lot of bottles 'cause she ain't lookin' for love 
 Hope you drive the newest car because she ain't lookin' for love 
 Hope you brought a lot of drugs because she ain't lookin' for love 
 That's no love 
 That's no love 
 That's no love 
 That's no love 
 Hope you got thousands in your pocket 'cause she ain't lookin' for love 
 Hope you pop a lot of bottles 'cause she ain't lookin' for love
