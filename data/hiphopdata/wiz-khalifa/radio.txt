Uh huh, Uh huh 
 Should I stay or should I leave 
 Don't know which way to go 
 My mind is saying yes, my heart keeps saying no 
 Can't find the words to explain, you always take it wrong 
 Call up the station, tell them play it on the radio whoa whoa 
 Play it on your radio whoa whoa 
 Play it on your radio whoa whoa 
 Should I stay or Should I leave 
 Don't know which way to go 
 My mind is saying yes, my heart keeps saying no 
 Can't find the words to explain, you always take it wrong 
 Call up the station, tell them play it on the radio 
 (Wiz Khalifa Verse 1) 
 I wanna call my girlfriend, but she's all mad 
 Everything was good then, now she's all bad 
 I hit your phone up, you never call back 
 Would I be wrong if I took everything I bought back 
 Me and you against the world girl, I thought that 
 I'd be able to see them signs, no contract 
 So high off of life, will make a hater catch a contact 
 But now I treat her like I'm jumping out a plane and fall back 
 Yeah, 'cause I can only dream of what we had 
 Try to work, but seems we go wrong 
 Sometimes I pray to God, you take me back 
 Then run and tell the homies I've moved on 
 But soon as I get my head right 
 You gon' think I'm stuck and I'm just frontin', no headlights 
 Put you in the club and bought you stuff you never wear twice 
 Now the thrill is gone and the decisions in the air like, Damn 
 Should I stay or Should I leave 
 Don't know which way to go 
 My mind is saying yes, my heart keeps saying no 
 Can't find the words to explain, you always take it wrong 
 Call up the station, tell them play it on the radio whoa whoa 
 Play it on your radio whoa whoa 
 Play it on the radio whoa whoa 
 (End)
