"Never too late, too late to start start, never too late, too late to start start" 
 I'm tryna have the wrist all bladed up 
 With all kitted up 
 Niggas say damn change, wiz couldn't give a fuck 
 Spit it like my last song, one life live it up 
 Niggas see damn's change, kids couldn't get a buck 
 So please don't approach me man 
 Like this a free show, cause you don't know me me fam 
 And please don't extend your hands like you know we fam 
 And please don't pretend like we only scram 
 Where was all this love at when I was only can? 
 When I was tryna sell y'all my only jam? 
 I don't keep friends, I'm my only fan 
 And take falls, I'll never, I will only stand 
 Ima make this all riches, is what I totally did 
 If you don't know me now, then how you know me then? 
 And I hope y'all loving the kid, but if not, its 
 "Never too late, too late to start start, never too late, too late to start start" 
 I'm tryna have the strip all whipped out 
 Crib all pimped out 
 Chicks smiling in my face, tongues all licked out 
 Flat on the front side, back all sticking out 
 Waiting for that one time, a rap nigga did it out 
 But you gone have to slow up love 
 Tryna skee 'cause she think ima blow up 'cause 
 All she thinking me getting her nails done, and her hair done 
 Ma I'm not the one 
 Ion need no chick plotting all my tricks 
 No birds tryna fly with me on my trips, 
 If I am with a Miss, she a down ass chick, 
 So take a sec, just chill and get off my tip 
 I'm just tryna get rich of these tracks I get 
 And you tryna get rich off the scratch I get 
 And you chicks think it's all about bread, but it's not, its... 
 "Never too late, too late to start start" 
 "'Cause I wan't to tell you, that there's no point in hating anybody, because to the extent that you tear down another, you tear down yourself (yeah, yeah), we have done the same s--" 
 I'm tryna have the city on lockdown 
 Fam off the block now 
 Money coming fast, more cash then the cops now 
 Would harass, but they can't really not now 
 Used to laugh, but your man's really hot now 
 I used to rap for the kids in class 
 Told 'em I would use rap just to get my cash 
 And I was on the word about how to get my math 
 And told my teachers and the staff they can kiss my ass 
 'Cause I can't find a interest in my book 
 So I stayed to myself and every class I took 
 Supposed to be doing work, but I made my hooks 
 'Cause I get motivation everywhere I look 
 And I show no regret for any chance I took 
 But I learn from mistakes just like I should 
 So if you dudes ain't paid your dues, for you fools its... 
 "Never too late, too late too start start, never too late, too late to start start"
