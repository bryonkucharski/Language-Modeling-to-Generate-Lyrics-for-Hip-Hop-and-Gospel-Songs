I heard that love, was blind 
 But girl I've seen it (girl I've seen it) 
 And I need it (yes I need it) 
 I want to make, you mine 
 And girl you know it, 'cause I showed it 
 Please don't blow it 
 What you need is right here (ah oh) 
 What you need is right here (ah) 
 Everything you need is right here (Right here, here, here) (ooh) 
 What you need is right here (ah) 
 Everything you need is right here (here, here, here) 
 (I got it right here for you girl) 
 And no I'm not there 
 It's true them other dudes don't compare 
 See I got girls a few I don't care 
 When I see you, I stop and I stare 
 I'm not some player 
 Or just some guy 
 You like my swagger 
 Think that I'm fly 
 You caught my eye 
 Across this club 
 I'm way pass drunk 
 I think I'm in love 
 And you my drug 
 I need you most 
 I take you until I overdose 
 Come here get close 
 And hit this smoke 
 If you want 'scape 
 Then we can get ghost 
 If you want go 
 Back to my crib 
 Get interested 
 Won' see how I live 
 Some peace and quiet 
 To get to know Wiz 
 Before we slide 
 You need to know this 
 I heard that love, was blind 
 But girl I've seen it (girl I've seen it) 
 And I need it (yes I need it) 
 I want to make, you mine 
 And girl you know it, 'cause I showed it 
 Please don't blow it 
 What you need is right here (ah oh) 
 What you need is right here (ah) 
 Everything you need is right here (Right here, here, here) (ooh) 
 What you need is right here (ah) 
 Everything you need is right here (here, here, here) 
 And no where else 
 It ain't my fault can't myself 
 I catch my breath 
 When I see you 
 You just my style 
 So whatchu won' do 
 You private it can just be us two 
 If you got friends 
 Then bring your crew 
 You know how to keep a secret 
 Me too 
 I won't tell no one else what we do 
 Puttin' your nails all in my tattoo 
 I want you bad as hell and that's true 
 You tell me what a playa gott' do 
 To make you understand a mad dude 
 I won't act new 
 When I'm around 
 If you end up lettin' me bust you down 
 I ain't no clown 
 That you know this 
 Before we slide you need to know this 
 I heard that love, was blind 
 But girl I've seen it (girl I've seen it) 
 And I need it (yes I need it) 
 I want to make, you mine 
 And girl you know it, 'cause I showed it 
 Please don't blow it 
 What you need is right here (ah oh) 
 What you need is right here (ah) 
 Everything you need is right here (Right here, here, here) (ooh) 
 What you need is right here (ah) 
 Everything you need is right here (here, here, here) 
 So don't go far 
 I won' be everywhere that you are 
 Your biggest fan 
 So be my star 
 I hope you find your way to my car 
 I take my time, do this right 
 I'm down for anything that you like 
 Make girls play the left 
 'Cause your right 
 Just one thing to tell you tonight 
 I heard that love, was blind 
 But girl I've seen it (girl I've seen it) 
 And I need it (yes I need it)
