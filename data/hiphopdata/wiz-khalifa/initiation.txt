(Intro: Wiz Khalifa) 
 Sledgero 
 You've always been a fool man, but you're stupid for this one 
 (Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa) 
 This is for my young niggas, this is for my paid niggas 
 This is for my wild niggas, this is for my gang members 
 This is for the ones that don't care 'bout bein' hood niggas 
 This is for them badasses, this is for them good niggas 
 This is for them fly niggas, this ain't for them broke niggas 
 This is for high niggas, roll one up and smoke, nigga 
 This is for them boss niggas that be gettin' paper 
 This is for them real niggas, this ain't for them fakers 
 (Hook: Wiz Khalifa) 
 This is for them Taylors [x16] 
 Yeah I got it, so I flaunt it 
 And I bought it 'cause I want it 
 Screamin' fuck a bitch nigga and a hater 
 This is for them 
 (Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa) 
 This is for them lil niggas that be goin' so hard 
 That be on they grind, know exactly where they post are 
 Tryin' to get they cheese, tryin' to get they pocket so large 
 This for niggas over-seas, this is for them dope boys 
 This is for them joint-smokers, this is for them gin-sippers 
 This ain't for no ho niggas, this ain't for no bitch niggas 
 This is for them rich niggas that be gettin' paper 
 All I do is ball, nigga, that's my human nature 
 This is for them niggas who know that they got strong pack 
 If it ain't strong, we don't blow that 
 If it ain't strong, it's gon' go back 
 Money so long, that shit throw-back 
 And my nigga, this shit paid for, I don't owe that 
 It's a movie dog, it's a Kodak 
 And I'm so gone, see you later 
 This ain't for y'all 
 (Verse 3: Lola Monroe) 
 Monroe, Taylor Gang's? 
 For dough, four more coupes then blow mo' 
 It's about to go down like a credit score 
 Your broke ass can't even use debit, whore 
 Versacci decor from the bed to the floor 
 Have several seats or exit door 
 Pussy sweet, shoot me 
 We ain't gettin' money, Jew me 
 Whole time your pockets' tighter than a new weave 
 Fuck 'em, we gon' roll up like two sleeves 
 Taylor Gang, I'm built to bang 
 Y'all pussy weed blanks from failure range 
 They could never duplicate my Taylor frames 
 It's the Taylor ring, got a Taylor dame 
 For this cheese, oh snap 
 And focus on my head shots 
 And I ain't never loafin', you won't catch me with bread knots 
 Eenie, meenie, minie fuckin' mo 
 All these birds be goosin', so I be duckin' hoes 
 N-never had an issue givin' bitches my ass to kiss 
 Wiz told me get 'em so I'm comin' out blastin' bitch 
 (Outro: Amber Rose) 
 Hey baby, it's me 
 Um, I know you out there performin' right now, but 
 I just wanted to leave you a little message 
 To let you know how much I love you 
 And I miss you 
 And I wish you were home with me right now 
 But I'm so proud of you 
 And I'm so happy that you're doin' so well out there 
 I miss you baby, I miss you so much 
 I can't wait to see you 
 I love you, muah, bye
