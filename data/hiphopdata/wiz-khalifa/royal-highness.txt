 Casey Veggies 
 If you don't know by now 
 I don't like driving, baby, I'm the pilot 
 Never let the plane come down 
 Forever on some fly shit 
 Yeah, I got it vibing 
 Baby girl knows my sound 
 I'm your royal highness 
 Baby going fast for me 
 Then I tell her slow it down 
 I ain't really worried about 
 When my time gon' come 
 'Cause I know it's now 
 I been really grinding 
 Baby, come find me 
 Gotta let me know you're down 
 I don't like driving, baby, I'm the pilot 
 Never let the plane come down 
 Forever on some fly shit 
 Yeah, I got it vibing 
 Baby girl knows my sound 
 I'm your royal highness 
 Baby going fast for me 
 Then I tell her slow it down 
 On the west side yeah I'm living proof 
 Started small but now everything new 
 I spit like I ain't got no tooth 
 Flying topless, the plane got no roof 
 I'ma shine till my name in the sky 
 I'ma ball hard and break all the rules 
 Graduated and hopped in that coupe 
 With my main girl now I gotta say bye to you 
 I can count up a mil on a bad day 
 She ain't down then she ain't got no use 
 By the way that she making that ass shake 
 I just told baby do what she do 
 She the type I got to search for 
 Wasn't handed to me, had to work for it 
 They riding the wave like a surf board 
 While the boy hotter than the earth core 
 Told her wait til' I go get my cash right 
 When the money was low she didn't act right 
 Caught up living in the fast life 
 To be the boss I paid the mad price 
 I be with some women watching Friday 
 Smoking spliffs up on the highway 
 Shawty call me royal highness 
 'Cause I did this shit my way 
 If you don't know by now 
 I don't like driving, baby, I'm the pilot 
 Never let the plane come down 
 Forever on some fly shit 
 Yeah, I got it vibing 
 Baby girl knows my sound 
 I'm your royal highness 
 Baby going fast for me 
 Then I tell her slow it down 
 I ain't really worried about

 Baby girl knows my sound 
 I'm your royal highness 
 Baby going fast for me 
 Then I tell her slow it down 
 Wiz Khalifa 
 Oh for real 
 Real expensive, my clothes 
 I'm reinventing flows 
 Presidential, my smoke 
 You guys are little clones 
 Go 'head and wash your self up 
 The only loud smell should be the dope 
 Everything else is top shelf 
 Dinner on a boat, smoking a joint 
 I call that time to kill 
 I don't trip, I let shit slide 
 But niggas 'round me will 
 5k, Vegas at Tao, The owner pay the bill 
 Best seats 
 We at the game, I'm ashing on the field 
 Soon as we board the plane, they screwing up they faces 
 Money in cases, old watches, colorful bracelets 
 Some of us famous 
 The others just started they come-up
