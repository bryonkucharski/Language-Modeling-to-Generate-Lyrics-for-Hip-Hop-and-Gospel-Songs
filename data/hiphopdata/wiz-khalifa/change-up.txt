Uh huh, uh, yeah, ya know, it's the boy Wiz 
 Sometimes I gotta sit back and think, ya know 
 The audacity I have for these n*ggas man, ya know 
 But you know I just gotta focus on the positive, ya know 
 'Cause the negative ain't gonna do nothin' but, you know what I'm sayin' 
 Bring me down, and I've worked too hard to get where I'm at 
 I can guarantee you one thing, I ain't going nowhere 
 I'm'a be right here baby, 412, uh huh, and this the Prince, yeah, yeah

 Uh, look homie I'm from the ill-gritty, city where they kill plenty 
 Lost some n*ggas along the way, some of 'em still wit' me 
 So why don't y'all come through, while the boys show you 
 How we livin' in the 412 
 Where young n*ggas got no intentions of workin' jobs 
 Cookin' that raw is they definition of workin' hard 
 Chop it, bag it, hit the block and work it hard 
 Tired of strugglin', so we started hustlin' 
 Gotta bring that money in, didn't wanna run the streets 
 But lookin' at an empty plate'll make a n*gga wanna eat 
 And get up on his feet, hustlin' and scramblin' 
 A (..?) will let the cold world make a man of him 
 And fam listen, pay attention to who you 'round 
 Another man can never pull you up, but he can pull you down 
 This somethin' every real n*gga can feel here 
 They hate me for the fact that I'm still here

 Yo, some say I mention drugs in every one of my songs 
 Not knowin' you ain't gotta be doin' wrong to get your hustle on 
 Long as you're goin' hard, I was taught, growin' up in Pittsburgh 
 Shit it means, gettin' cake by any means 
 N*ggas on that rap shit, n*ggas on that crack shit 
 Most n*ggas will clap quick, end up on your back split 
 Some n*ggas will 9 to 5, and never make a pack flip 
 Tryin' to get that cheese, some n*ggas end up on that rat shit 
 'Round here that's how you get sent into a back-flip 
 Nothin' else to be said, my n*ggas try and see bread 
 Tired of them stomach pains, n*ggas try and keep fed 
 Fillin' up your pipe veins, green for the weed-head 
 City full of pipe-dreams, believe me I been sold those 
 Heavy chronic habit, we gon' need the whole zone 
 I stay higher than the Ozone Layer 
 I'm from the Burgh, n*gga don't go there

 I never backed or run away, slacked for one day 
 Had somethin' on my chest, and held back what I wanna say 
 That's how I wasn't raised, manned up quicker 
 The young boy grew up into a stand up n*gga 
 Fuck you pay me, I demand them figures 
 I'm gettin' mine shorty, we young n*ggas on the rise, on the grind shorty Had enough of the lies, jealous n*ggas I despise, look in my eyes
