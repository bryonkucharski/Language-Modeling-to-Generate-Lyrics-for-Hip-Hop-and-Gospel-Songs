Oh 
 It's kinda crazy 'cause 
 People think 
 I got it made just 'cause I got paper 
 I mean 
 I do got it made but 
 That's 'cause I made it myself 
 Gang Gang 
 Uh, people be all in my face 
 Wasn't the time and the place 
 Do interviews and I'm on stage 
 'Cause baby I gotta get paid 
 Don't matter what most people say 
 'Cause all of 'em get in the way 
 I'm working with more than I play 
 Which mean I'm gon' be here to stay 
 I roll me one up and I blaze 
 And take a tree straight to the face 
 Those thuggers keep hoping I change 
 But no, I'ma stay in my lane 
 I'm smelling like weed on the plane 
 And white people think it's a shame 
 As soon as they mention my name 
 They go back to being the same 
 I did everything that I want (uh) 
 I still don't really care what anybody else think 
 Now I can have anything, I ain't gon' stunt 
 And I don't feel bad 'cause I did it my way 
 And now they all say 
 "It must be nice, it must be nice 
 To have them Washingtons on your side 
 It must be nice, it must be nice 
 To have everybody on your side 
 It must be nice, it must be nice 
 To have them Washingtons by your side 
 It must be nice, it must be nice 
 To have everybody by your side" 
 Whether you coming or leaving 
 Know everybody be talking 
 Nigga be having a problem 
 Straighten up soon as you walking 
 Some of them familiar faces 
 Fame is so easy to get lost in 
 So many different motives 
 If you slip up it'll cost you 
 Don't know who got your best interest 
 But you don't stop, you keep going 
 They really talking, you live it 
 When the time come you gon' show it 
 Keep on my heart and stay focused 
 Come with a different approaching 
 Go from a player to coach be 
 'Cause you go harder than most 
 I did everything that I want (uh) 
 I still don't really care what anybody else think 
 Now I can have anything, I ain't gon' stunt 
 And I don't feel bad 'cause I did it my way 
 And now they all say 
 "It must be nice, it must be nice 
 To have them Washingtons on your side 
 It must be nice, it must be nice 
 To have everybody on your side 
 It must be nice, it must be nice 
 To have them Washingtons by your side 
 It must be nice, it must be nice 
 To have everybody by your side"
