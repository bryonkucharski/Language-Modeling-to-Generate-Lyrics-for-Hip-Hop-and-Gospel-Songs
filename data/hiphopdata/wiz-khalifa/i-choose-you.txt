I oh, I choose you baby 
 That's what the game told me 
 Ain't nothin' change, still the same man 
 The game chose me, sing 
 Oh, I choose you baby 
 You know the game chose me 
 Ain't nothin' change, this is what the game told me 
 Listen close here youngin' 
 See I've been doing this here the most fed coming chea 
 And not a dude that a post here frontin 
 See niggas pay attention to mine 
 You listen and find, you gone hear something 
 I know 
 Niggas wanna know how I came up 
 He only 18, they see him stacking his change up 
 And alot of niggas chose to get in the game 
 But difference from you damn pricks 
 The prince was hand picked 
 The young guy is about as fly as it can get 
 They want I, 'cause I supply and demand quick 
 I'm C4 explosive is how ya man spit 
 And I got a seat for anyone who can't stand it 
 I ain't chose the game, the game chose me 
 A lil fame from the rap, but still the same OG 
 'Cause when I came in it, cats said I stayed lowkey 
 But always making sure they know me 
 That's when the game told me 
 I oh, I choose you baby 
 See I ain't choose the game, the game choose me 
 A lil fame, but still the same OG 
 That when the game told me 
 Oh, I choose you baby 
 'Cause when I came in it, cats said I stayed lowkey 
 But always making sure they know me, 
 That's when the game told me 
 And you know 
 I can't get enough, it's like I got a fetish for it 
 Too many wack MC's for me to just ignore it 
 I get on track simply to flood the state with heat 
 Stack my cake and eat, preaching more then they the streets 
 Seen them teens drop out the bumping the corner 
 Money and order, so they don't even want their diploma 
 Me, I'm tryna make a company owner 
 So while that may be tempting, this rap shit is bringing the ends in 
 And some say that (what?) there will be no one greater than him 
 One day that (what?) non believers, I'll convince em 
 I'm more of a leader and eating like I'm supposed to 
 Talk by the older dude, stand on my own two (yes) 
 And I'm deep in the game, not like I toasted be 
 I get somewhere if a lane, they took over me 
 Somewhere down the line, the grind molded me 
 It's so sick and this what the game told to me 
 I oh, I choose you baby 
 That's what the game told me 
 Ain't nothin' change, still the same man 
 The game chose me, sing 
 Oh, I choose you baby 
 You know the game chose me 
 Ain't nothin' change, this is what the game told me 
 Now ima take you back to 97 
 I put in work to grind better 
 I was now with a rhyme fetish 
 Aged quicker, and seeing things in a different way 
 Was fourteen when I figured I had some shit to say 
 So I let it be known 
 That the tighter with top spitter 
 I'm coming for em, ready to own 
 And if somebody better let 'em be shown 
 I'm a comptetitive dude, plus I'm ten steps ahead of you fools, they say 
 I oh, I choose you baby 
 See I ain't choose the game, the game choose me 
 A lil fame, but still the same OG 
 That when the game told me 
 Oh, I choose you baby 
 'Cause when I came in it, cats said I stayed lowkey 
 But always making sure they know me, 
 That's when the game told me
