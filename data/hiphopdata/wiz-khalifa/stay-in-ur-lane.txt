These dudes better stay in they lane 
 And get there brain on the right track. 
 Now you gotta check your do-cane cash 
 And you let ya mouth write that. 
 We ain't playin' when the shit get real 
 Talk shit get your life snatched. 
 And don't rest better guard ya grill 
 That's how it is 'cause it's like that. 
 I move blocks to rude pops and dude drops. 
 I'm too hot mix J Big and tupac. 
 So move not I'm way big and dude shot. 
 Ya crew watch I'm hot bitch and you not. 
 I'm not a fake matter 
 Nigga I don't pop shit about my cake holla. 
 Make dollars but you perp and you make notta 
 Notta man notta cent hoe I stay propa. 
 Face scholar nigga let the trey 8's holla. 
 And punk nigga play dumb get ya face swallowed. 
 You not a hustla dog 
 You don't know what half a brick means 
 In rap, you get eight like half of sixteen, I'll 
 Bash ya team dang I'm sickning I'm dope 
 Plus coke will smash ya trip beam man. 
 But before all them balls come and lump ya face 
 With all that tuff talk and pump ya brakes 
 Ease back shawty. 
 These dudes better stay in they lane

 Ya rhymein's a waste can I mean with this basic look 
 The mean to face it'll eat through ya face and then 
 I breeze through this place 
 No heat on my waste, but still 
 Will eat through your face with knees in this place 
 I'm on the move now, high price big places 
 Leave them niggas like 100 with the big faces 
 Niggas try to act bad in them red cases 
 Till that metals in they mouth like a pair of braces. 
 Big road talk slick up in them fake lies 
 Same time he just another fruit up in the grape vine. 
 You see I laugh clock math 'cause I take time. 
 And you trash plus ass at the waste line. 
 And don't test, cause dude you'll be losing ya breathe. 
 Got respect like I movin the tech. 
 And I advise you and your crew to doin' your best. 
 Try and get your mind right or we'll be movin it left.

 You see its real when a nigga say 
 Ballin, really got dough, real that he say he push coke 
 But really got blow. 
 Common that he claimin that he thug but he not doe 
 And when do a nigga say spittin' really got flow. 
 I ain't playin' around. 
 I'm not a gangster, 
 But if you cross mine I'll be layin' them down. 
 Yeah, you talk about poppin' ya heat. 
 But when the beefs on them real OG's 
 Will come and rock you to sleep. Coward. 
 In my advice you should think twice. 
 Before you cross the path of a real nigga. 
 Live the street life. 
 Who pull cards and reach for they heat right. 
 N' youl get smoked like them tree' in the peace pipe. 
 Man they put you in the dirt yeah. 
 You steady throwin' up the set. 
 But you ain't never put in work there. 
 So all that talk about the game you bang. 
 Just stay in your lane before a shot lay 'n' ya frame. Yeah.
