(Niggas gonna need a nap in a little bit) 
 Burn slow (Get back up from a trap nap) 
 Burn slow, burn slow 
 (I'm burning slow right now) 
 Burn slow 
 (I'm at the end of the inscent) 
 Burn slow, burn slow 
 (Niggas ain't got kids) 
 Burn slow, burn slow 
 Nobody open the door 
 Homie I blow by the "O" 
 Burning it down, good shit is all that I know 
 I done had all that before 
 Shawty a pro, told her get down on the floor 
 She take it all in her throat 
 She wanna go, smell the weed all in my clothes 
 Fuck her, don't need her no more 
 Six in a row, get a bitch, give her the bone 
 Break her like six in them stones 
 Niggas so cold, thinking I sit in the snow 
 I keep a bitch getting stoned 
 Smoke in my home, all my whips covered in chrome 
 All my dips love giving dome 
 Get it to go, back to my crib stuffing cones 
 Y'all either kids or my clones 
 We turnt up on marijuana and champagne 
 Them niggas talk 'bout who they are, but they don't do a thing 
 Can't tell me I ain't drunk, I'm on that water in a cup 
 Different strokes, find me a bitch I can poke 
 I'mma go get me an "O" and 
 Burn slow, burn slow 
 Burn slow, burn slow 
 Burn slow, burn slow 
 Burn slow, burn slow 
 Got a couple thousand dollars and some change rolled up 
 I get money every day so everything's on us 
 I got my own strain, it come with my name 
 Go straight to the brain, your shit ain't the same 
 A different lane, we sipping champagne 
 I been in the game, just give me a flame 
 She looking for change, I'm rolling up Jane 
 I'm balling insane, got more than six rings 
 In love with my slang, I'm puffing a J 
 I hunt her today, come up with a play 
 Most of these niggas be wanting to cuff on a bitch 
 I just be up in the way, stuff in the safe 
 I'm loving the race, stuck in first place 
 Fuck her for days 
 Them niggas wanna talk about it but they don't wanna roll 
 What it takes to be a real G, they don't even know 
 I go to her page, she come to my place 
 It look like a maze, we roll up a plane 
 She look at my change, she start giving brain 
 If they ain't the gang, then we ain't the same 
 Burn slow, burn slow 
 Burn slow, burn slow 
 Burn slow, burn slow 
 Burn slow, burn slow
