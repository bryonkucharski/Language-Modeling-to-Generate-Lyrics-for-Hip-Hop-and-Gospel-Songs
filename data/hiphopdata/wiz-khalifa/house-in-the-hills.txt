Got no time for the conversations or funny shit 
 Nigga, only the reals who I get my money with 
 Used to turn on the TV, see what I want 
 And now the same one I dreamed about, the same one I'm stuntin' in 
 In the 6-2, almost 26 
 And every nigga that I'm with got a zip 
 I look at this shit as one big table and best believe every nigga I'm with got a sit 
 They try to hold us back, paint a picture of us, then sell it straight to the public 
 You young, black, then you thuggin' 
 What they don't talk about the kid that came from nothin' 
 Who stuck to what he believed in and turned himself into something great 
 They should use that story to motivate 
 But instead they'd rather focus on the fact that he's a pothead 
 Not the fact there's not a lot where I lived 
 25 and not dead 
 I'm tryna tell you somethin', this shit's real 
 When you work hard to get it that's how you feel 
 The man that start what they knew and they ain't (?) away 
 We started small to them houses in the hills 
 To them houses in the hills 
 Houses in the hills 
 Houses in the hills 
 To them houses in them hills 
 You make a little money, take care and right yourself 
 And people start coming up with they hand out 
 People take their stresses and make them yours 
 Well that's just what comes with being a man 
 I try to do all that I can to make sure that 
 My son grow up without having to see half of the stuff I've been through 
 But in life we all got our own path 
 Don't understand that by now you won't begin to 
 Cop another Rollex or Porsche try and get even with me 
 Pulled up to the club, swear it looked like the dealer with me 
 'Cause we had so many cars it was stupid 
 So I don't see a reason to try and reason with me 
 Made a couple million and fast too 
 They ain't teach a young nigga that in the classroom 
 Or how to make your people better by taking knowledge and spreadin' it 
 Not being in the game but ahead of it 
 When you work hard to get it that's how you feel 
 The man that start what they knew and they ain't (?) away 
 We started small to them houses in the hills 
 To them houses in the hills 
 Houses in the hills 
 Houses in the hills 
 To them houses in them hills 
 Thousand dollar benefit plates 
 No matter how high the stakes, niggas never outta place 
 Now I'm high, Empire State 
 Drunk stumblin', never will I tumble far from grace 
 I'm one of them under-celebrated greats 
 Under the influence of what Uncle Snoop threw me 
 Soon as I stepped off the plane 
 Switchin' four lanes like Jay and Jermaine 
 Killin' beats, visitin' grave sites and pissin' champagne 
 I been in the crib enjoying my hobbies 
 Suckers figured this'll be the perfect time to try me 
 Try me 
 Assumptions that I'm lunchin', gettin' sloppy 
 I'm just gettin' better, seasoned veteran 
 Eagle eye perspective, scope before I go in 
 Come out with the whole hen 
 A dollar and a dream 
 Have a house on the hill and the world on a screen 
 When you work hard to get it that's how you feel 
 The man that start what they knew and they ain't (?) away 
 We started small to them houses in the hills 
 To them houses in the hills 
 Houses in the hills 
 Houses in the hills 
 To them houses in them hills
