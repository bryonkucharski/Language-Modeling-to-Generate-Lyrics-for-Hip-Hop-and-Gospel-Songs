 Taylor Gang Taylor Gang Taylor Gang Taylor Gang 
 You know I'm reppin' Taylor (Bang X16) 
 On my way from Cali, 
 So you know I'm smokin' flavor 
 Ain't fuckin' wit blunts, 
 You know we only smokin' paper 
 And I throw it up so that they know just what my gang is 
 Mother fuck a hater 
 (Wiz Khalifa verse 1) 
 I left the crib with 10 grand bought a hundred pair, 
 I'm the coach I can show you how to be a player, 
 Five-eights is the fitted, bitches love my hair, 
 Camo shorts go with anything I wanna wear, 
 The let me in the club fuck a dress code, 
 Me and all my niggas rollin' up the best smoke, 
 Og kush from the West Coast, 
 Oh you down to fuck? Well shortie let's go, 
 Diamonds in my chain niggas tryin' to steal my lane, 
 Tryin' to get my brain bitch I'm reppin' Taylor Gang, 
 Smoke till I'm insane, drinkin' till I'm throwin' up 
 Only papers if you Taylor'd nigga throw it up, 
 High socks, low cuts, 
 Smell that good weed then you know it's us, 
 That yellow car pulling up them niggas ain't hot so they close to us, 
 Got 'em flying two fingers and hold 'em up, 
 Taylor Gang Taylor Gang Taylor Gang Taylor Gang 
 Taylor Gang Taylor Gang Taylor Gang Taylor Gang 
 You know I'm reppin' Taylor (Bang X16) 
 On my way from Cali,

 Ain't fuckin' wit blunts,

 And I throw it up so that they know just what my gang is 
 Mother fuck a hater 
 (Wiz Khalifa 2nd Verse) 
 Bought a crib like scarefaces, this is my world 
 All my niggas down to bang but we can try worse 
 Smoking ounces to the head, feel my mind twirls 
 I'm the mayor and my bitch look like a fly girl, 
 Topic of discussion talk shit 'cause they bitches love us, 
 Plus them niggas suckas I got that in living color, 
 All my cars are different colors, all my broads are different colors, 
 All I do is fuck 'em once, and I don't call or give 'em numbers, 
 Rolex, more sex, good weed, no stress, 
 Run my town, arms, chest, lift weights, boflex, 
 Throw your set up what you rep when you twistin ya fingers, 
 Real recoginze real and my nig you a stranger, 
 Gotta bank for a scrilla, a brain full of papers, 
 Got a phone full of hoes, and a gang full of Taylors 
 Taylor Gang Taylor Gang Taylor Gang Taylor Gang 
 Taylor Gang Taylor Gang Taylor Gang Taylor Gang 
 You know I'm reppin' Taylor (Bang X16) 
 On my way from Cali, 
 So you know I'm smokin' flavor 
 Ain't fuckin' wit blunts, 
 You know we only smokin' paper 
 And I throw it up so that they know just what my gang is 
 Mother fuck a hater 
 (Chevy woods) 
 You see me out I rep my gang, 
 Used serve that John McCain,

 Gettin' all this money wit you know who, 
 It's Taylor Gang over you, 
 We poppin' bottles gang signs, 
 All my niggas gang signs, 
 Rollin' up gang signs, 
 Niggas trippin', bang time, 
 Hold up, what they say 'bout us? 
 Same niggas gotta get the ok 'bout stuff, 
 They ain't in the same league, 
 They don't play like us, 
 No stems no seeds keep that rolled up, 
 Bang on them hoes, we does that, 
 Socket work, I just had a plug for that, 
 Get your Taylor on, 
 Hold for whatever you rep, 
 Throwin' up the gang,
