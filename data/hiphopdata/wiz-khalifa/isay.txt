It's KK what I'm smoking nigga 
 And I done popped so many bottles thing I'm through with it 
 Been smoking so much weed in public own a school with it 
 Been on my grind since I was young and now I'm stupid rich 
 You niggas stupid, I'm in the club and it's ruthless 
 My crew ain't part of that bullshit 
 My new whips the hardest 
 Walk in the office like a business man 
 I'm just an artist 
 Smoking and all, crib full of weed 
 Plaques on the wall 
 My face on all the magazines 
 Kush in this jar I'm getting this cheese 
 Pants skinny rubber bands plenty 
 Whole team going hard like it's the last inning 
 Whole team going hard you got no chance of winning 
 Lot of seats on the floor lot of cash pinning 
 I play the game left hand like my man Jimmy 
 You just a right hand man call that man semi 
 What can I say? 
 What can I do? 
 To show how much 
 Real shit a nigga do 
 What can I say? 
 What can I do? 
 To show how much 
 Real shit a nigga do 
 All of this off the internet 
 Those who ain't seen it coming dog I been a threat 
 Been smoking up all this weed 
 Been rolling up while I drive 
 Been to the bottom and back 
 Been seen you haters disguised 
 Niggas telling me lies 
 Just to try to get close 
 Shades cover my eyes 'cause I be higher than most 
 Been on the plane for twenty hours, and wasn't tired 
 Live by the code, money power 
 Once I got on, my niggas hired 
 Juicy J he ride, it's the gang or die 
 The game will stress you out but that's what this dubie is for 
 You acting like you know me now 
 Never knew me before 
 Snoop sat me down, school me even more 
 Kick it with my son and don't even do the awards 
 Said next year I might win me one 
 You got problems don't lend me none 
 Got a pound then go send me one 
 What can I say? 
 What can I do? 
 To show how much 
 Real shit a nigga do 
 What can I say? 
 What can I do? 
 To show how much 
 Real shit a nigga do 
 Niggas out here broke because they scared of that bread 
 My money so old I got mold on that bread 
 How you think I win and copped that Rolls-Royce Corniche? 
 Turn around and bought a Maybach next week 
 A nigga don't hustle then a nigga don't eat 
 A nigga ain't paying fair, and life ain't cheap 
 Nigga ain't shit sweet but this box of swisher sweets 
 Ever since I was a youngin I was 
 Getting it in the streets 
 Now I'm on tour even getting it overseas 
 All the way in Switzerland stacking swisser-cheese 
 I ain't too good for that brown paper bag 
 I can still move that work and I get it off fast, hoe 
 What can I say? 
 What can I do? 
 To show how much 
 Real shit a nigga do 
 What can I say? 
 What can I do? 
 To show how much 
 Real shit a nigga do
