Last night I let the party get the best of me 
 Waking up in the morning, two hoes laying next to me 
 Plus I heard an officer arrested me 
 Good weed and cold drinks, that's the motherfucking recipe 
 Nigga and we roll deep, so deep 
 It's going down in this bitch, concrete 
 We gon party all night, no sleep 
 Tell the owner them is all my guys 
 So tonight everything is on me 
 The drinks is on me 
 The bitches, the hotel, the weed is all free 
 Get high, I mean so high 
 We don't see the whole suite 
 Then we goin' fly to a level where you goin' need yo own key 
 TGOD 
 No driving, no sleeping 
 Live it up like it's the weekend life 
 When the DJ play the right song 
 Gonna drink, gonna party all night long 
 No driving, no sleeping 
 Live it up like it's the weekend 
 When the DJ play the right song 
 Gonna drink, gonna party all night long 
 Leaving from the club now she wanna stay with us 
 Came to spend it all, don't care what I'm paying for 
 Used to be too young, now I'm out here buying the bar 
 Everytime I look up, it's another red cup 
 Bunch of niggas in the game but they ain't playing with us 
 They just paying enough 
 Man them niggas ain't ballin they just laying it up 
 Saying they does, I'm just rolling hella weed up 
 While on my way to the club 
 I had to wait at the club 
 But now I don't cause everything is on me 
 The drinks is on me 
 The bitches, the hotel, the weed is all free 
 Get high, I mean so high we see the whole street 
 We fly I mean so fly we goin' need a whole week 
 TGOD 
 No driving, no sleeping 
 Live it up like it's the weekend 
 When the DJ play the right song 
 Gonna drink, gonna party all night long 
 No driving, no sleeping 
 Live it up like it's the weekend 
 When the DJ play the right song 
 Gonna drink, gonna party all night long
