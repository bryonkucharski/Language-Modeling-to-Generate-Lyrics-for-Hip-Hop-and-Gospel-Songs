Yeah 
 Nigga for real, for real 
 My niggas is real, for real 
 I'm the field for real 
 I'm 'bout my check for real 
 I'm 'bout my respect for real 
 My diamonds are crystal clear 
 I'm shining from ear to ear 
 Roll with the paper, see them lames later 
 Can't save her, her nigga stepped out, now she sayin' what she really think 
 Rollin' up pounds of dank 
 Open accounts, no matter where we at, smoking there and back 
 Eyes barely open, not never smokin' 
 Hit her once and she choke 
 2 K's, that means it's potent 
 Can't overdose but my strain explosive 
 Trained to go, my chain, it glow 
 Everything you see, I paid for 
 Gang or croak 
 Nigga for real, for real 
 My niggas is real, for real 
 I'm the field for real 
 I'm 'bout my check for real

 My diamonds are crystal clear (they clear) 
 I'm shining from ear to ear 
 I'm shinin' from ear to ear 
 Stand my ground, I ain't showin' no fear 
 I done came up like the top of the stairs 
 These niggas hate 'cause they cannot compare, aw shit 
 I'm in the crowd with the mosh pit 
 I hit the stage and they show tits 
 I'm in the game, I can't forfeit 
 Honestly, I'ma make more hits 
 Hop in the coupe and I swerve into lady 
 She gave me top because I am the greatest 
 I stayed the same and then came all the changes 
 You wanna know what it's like to be famous 
 Rollin' up weed in public 
 Skies be on all of that fuck shit 
 I'm ballin' bitch, like I got buckets 
 And they hate 'cause we stunt like nothing, biatch! 
 Nigga for real, for real (for real)

 My niggas trap for real 
 Run in the game 
 You speak on me, put "Big Homie" in front of my name 
 For every one of you lames 
 Y'all unoriginal niggas, they all sound the same

 Got the bug, I think they caught it
