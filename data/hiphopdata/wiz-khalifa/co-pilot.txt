They see me coming they say they come big time 
 Yeah nigga big money big rhymes 
 Big old thing in my past for big body dimes 
 Between hate and love is a very thin line 
 You see me coming they say they go big dope

 Big old thing in my short for big body bro's 
 Between hate and love is where the guns pop off 
 Now I don't buy shit, all of my chips go high lips 
 Boog it up nice jeans, born styling 
 Hot tack shit, expects shower hate TV's 
 In the mirrors watch the house with my bad chick 
 Pull size to cruise, bubble back that oh we feelin' in the move 
 With some slow wet sex she real splash it 
 She told me go long and do it bad at me
