If I said it, I meant it nigga... 
 We all in... everything's taylored 
 And fuck it, we ain't gotta go to the store no more 
 I got my own papers baby girl, I'm finna get my own weed too 
 Get you a pound and let you roll that shit 
 Uh, I'm rollin' up the windows while I'm smoking weed 
 Driving through my town like I don't know the speed 
 Countin' so much paper I can't fold it up 
 Bad bitch, she sucks me while I'm rollin' up 
 Yeah bitch, you probably see me everywhere 
 Money long, now my house got TV's everywhere 
 Literally everywhere you turn you see a flat-screen 
 New bitch... looked nothing like my last fling 
 Ridin' in a Maserati nigga no shirt 
 Niggas probably hatin' on me but it won't work 
 Camo shorts on like a general 
 Mind on a meal blowin' on medicinal 
 I'm just a young nigga hustliiiiiiiiin yeah... 
 Hustliiiiiiiiiiiiiiinn yeah... (X2) 
 Been through every nigga town, neva had a problem 
 Young millionaire, never had a job though 
 Throw that money up and watch her hit the ground 
 As long as your money up she said it's goin' down 
 Brought her homegirl said that she don't do friends 
 Kicked the bitch out and make her find new friends 
 Should I get hella high or buy some new rims 
 745 or a new benz 
 I take every day and live like it's the weekend 
 Doin' it all if you ain't ballin, take a seat then 
 If I said it, I meant it... throw a stack at that bitch'ass 
 And make her pay her rent with it 
 I'm just a young nigga hustliiiiiiiiin yeah... 
 Hustliiiiiiiiiiiiiiinn yeah... (X2)
