 Back with another one of them classic ones, fuck with the boy 
 Say you tired of hired help come and fuck with the boss 
 Niggas say "Man you winning" fuck it I tell 'em of course 
 I get love like a star, units move, cake appear 
 412 PGH you hatin' 'cause we cakin' here 
 Ask around you'll hear about the noise the youngin's making here 
 Hit 'em with that 'Oh No', now I'm record breaking here 
 See this that slow flow you heard of 
 Seeing mo dough and re-ing more dro to burn up 
 Keep it low though before the po-po swerve up 
 Pull us to the side and them homos search us 
 Gotta keep the work up, 'cause I was taught supply-demand 
 Smoking putting Pistolvania on the map 'cause I'm the man 
 Hustle hard plus the ladies love the nasty flow, scrappy know 
 So why you hate me? 'Cause he crazy since the 80's (fucker)

 Not quite the remix, you see this G-Shit? 
 For you to Pittsburgh ditty-bop to the beat with 
 Fresh with my A-1's, keep a leaning fitted cap 
 For those who sick of rap thank God ya niggas back 
 A lot of niggas wack and that's just sad to see 
 We in a marathon you cats are lapped to me 
 Khalifa still the same, ain't nothing change but my change 
 And my foot got a lil deeper up in the game 
 It's hard seeing through all this reefer up in my brain 
 Let the trunk bang while you weaving and switching them lanes 
 Hope if you in the club let 'em know you moving through 
 To pop something, roll something, man do what you do 
 18, making major moves that's why they hate me brother 
 Plus I'm getting cakey I been crazy since the 80's fucker

 Let me make it clear, when that cake appear 
 Ima make more in one day than most niggas make a year 
 I put my time in, (what you doin' man?) nothing but grinding 
 Moving these units they coming back for what I'm supplying 
 I'm from the Steel-City, y'all niggas still lost 
 I'm the youngest in charge spittin' that real raw 
 My dutchies real long plus I work real hard 
 Fuck a battle dog I'll show you how to make a real song 
 Or how to switch states, get cake from a mixtape 
 Couple hundred-thousand off my face from Myspace 
 You'll be frustrated from tryna keep up with my pace 
 How I control the track you fools get over-lapped 
 You'll get left in the dust just cause you lesser than us 
 And coming at the kid? Simply said it's just pressing ya luck 
 See I was hungry on this grind when you was lazy brother 
 So why you hate me? I been crazy since the 80's fucker
