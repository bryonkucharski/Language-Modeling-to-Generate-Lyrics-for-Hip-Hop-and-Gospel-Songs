My jeans cost a thousand 
 My whip from the old school 
 Nothin' but bosses around us 
 And you ain't got no pool 
 So much champagne, I drowned in it 
 OG, rolled a pound of it 
 Keep it G, you like the sound of it 
 Came to spend money, who's countin' it? 
 I'm the realest in the drop, just left the dealer 
 In this outfit I'm a killer, tell the coppers I ain't innocent 
 If it's poppin', then I'm in it 
 Own it all, you probably rent it 
 When I talk, you niggas listen 
 Thirty thousand, I'mma spend it 
 Hella bottles in my section 
 Throwin' money on the floor 
 No, I ain't on the guest list 
 I walk right in through the door 
 I'm so turnt up, so turnt up (Get higher!) 
 I'm so turnt up, so turnt up (Get higher!) 
 I'm so turnt up, so turnt up (Get higher!) 
 I'm so turnt up, so turnt up (Get higher!) 
 Mixing gin up with the Tequila 
 Smokin' reefer 
 Got it twisted thinkin' I don't get fucked up 
 Make you a believer 
 Camera's outside, there go young Khalifa 
 No keys, left the 69 inside 
 'Cause my license just expired 
 I'm in my Cadillac I don't drive 
 Hit the club and get so high 
 And I don't really know about y'all 
 But all of my niggas got bank 
 I'm payin' for all of these bottles 
 I'm a boss nigga, fuck you think? 
 Good weed, good drink, better clothes 
 Fast cars, club owners let us smoke 
 Grind hard, you don't work hard, you'll never know 
 How it feel, to have a couple niggas that's real 
 Hella bottles in my section 
 Throwin' money on the floor 
 No, I ain't on the guest list 
 I walk right in through the door 
 I'm so turnt up, so turnt up (Get higher!) 
 I'm so turnt up, so turnt up (Get higher!) 
 I'm so turnt up, so turnt up (Get higher!) 
 I'm so turnt up, so turnt up (Get higher!) 
 Get higher! 
 Get higher! 
 Get higher! 
 Get higher!
