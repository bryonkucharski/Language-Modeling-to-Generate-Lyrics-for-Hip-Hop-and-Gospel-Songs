Let it go, let it go homie 
 You know we can see through them blinds homie 
 And see through the truth and them lies homie 
 Just let it go, let it go, let it go 
 (Oh oh oh oh) 
 (Oh oh oh oh) 
 (Oh oh oh oh) 
 (Oh oh oh oh) 
 I done stay on top of my game, Gang controlling my lane 
 Paid so much for my frames, put these lil niggas to shame 
 Ordered so many of them bottles, so many of them bottles you would think I am insane 
 Already changed the game once I done told you 
 But now I'm gonna do it another one do it again 
 Tell the club owners we need more sections 
 I made these lil niggas go cop they Rolexes 
 You get the venue, you gon' need more bouncers 
 And tell the weed man we gon' need more ounces 
 Hundred grand in a rubber band 
 Use to be the kid, now homie I'm the man 
 Hundred grand in a rubber band 
 I used to be the kid, but now homie I'm the man 
 Let it go, let it go homie 
 You know we can see through the blinds homie 
 See through the truth and them lies homie 
 Just let it go, let it go, let it go 
 Let it go, let it go homie 
 You know they can see what we see homie 
 Difference from the real and make believe homie 
 So let it go, let it go, let it go 
 Living my life about peace 
 Sharing this money and trying to all of niggas up and off them streets 
 Used to look up some niggas, but now it all seem that it come down to me 
 Make sure my family gon' eat 
 Grinding from up underneath 
 Now they just say I'm a now they just say I'm a beast 
 And now all these haters looking at me pitifully 
 'Cause I'm the shit, literally 
 And I be stuntin' when I ride past my old school 
 I say fuck the new car, I cop the old school 
 Let it go, let it go homie 
 You know we can see through the blinds homie 
 See through the truth and them lies homie 
 Just let it go, let it go, let it go 
 Let it go, let it go homie 
 You know they can see what we see homie 
 Difference from the real and make believe homie 
 So let it go, let it go, let it go 
 This time I feel like its now or never 
 And going nowhere so no matter what they say I be here forever 
 Even though some folks will make it so you can't win 
 Don't need to take it on the gin 
 Remember homie you ain't even gotta hold it in 
 Let it go, let it go homie 
 You know we can see through the blinds homie 
 See through the truth and them lies homie 
 Just let it go, let it go, let it go 
 Let it go, let it go homie 
 You know they can see't what we see homie 
 Difference from the real and make believe homie 
 So let it go, let it go, let it go 
 Let let it go, let it go, let it go 
 Let them go, let them go, let them go 
 Let them know, let them know, let them know
