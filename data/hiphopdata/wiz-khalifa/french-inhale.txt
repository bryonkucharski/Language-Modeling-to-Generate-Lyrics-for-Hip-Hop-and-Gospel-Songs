(Chorus - Mike Posner) 
 French Inhale, I like the way you French Inhale 
 Do it Again 
 French Inhale, I like the way you French Inhale 
 Do it Again 
 (Verse 1 - Wiz Khalifa) 
 You don't gotta sell it, 'cause its already sold 
 And you don't gotta roll one 'cause its already rolled 
 Check out my technique, just weed let it fold 
 Shit I've been smokin' since I was 14 years old 
 I had a dime who never smoked blunts just bowls 
 Taught me how to blow O's, inhale threw my nose 
 So if you see me smoking ' blow my high 
 Uh, so I roll one and we both gonna fly 
 You smell it all in my clothes 
 I'm taking in all the smoke when I... 
 (Chorus - Mike Posner) 
 French Inhale, I like the way you French Inhale 
 Do it Again 
 French Inhale, I like the way you French Inhale 
 Do it Again 
 (Verse 2 - Snoop Dogg) 
 I take it to the face, inhale it threw my nose 
 Blowin' with the homies on the low, man f-ck these hoes! 
 It crackalack, peel it back 
 Whatcha call that mack who crack a bad bitch like that? 
 A cracker jack! 
 I'm like a florist, touring like a tourist 
 Godzilla flying on a pegasaurus 
 Niggas know about it, even 'fore I pull it out 
 I put some fire on it, and now there beggin me to put it out 
 I'm in the hallway rolling on the purple syke 
 I know the in's and out's so I'mma do what the f-ck I like 
 (Chorus - Mike Posner) 
 French Inhale, I like the way you French Inhale 
 Do it Again 
 French Inhale, I like the way you French Inhale 
 Do it Again
