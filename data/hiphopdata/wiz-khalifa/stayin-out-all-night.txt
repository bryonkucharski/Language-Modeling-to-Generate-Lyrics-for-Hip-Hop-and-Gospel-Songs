I had so much champagne up in the club 
 And ain't come up here tonight looking for love 
 I'mma leave all my problems out on the floor 
 I'mma drink so much that I can't make it home 
 So would you take me home? (Yeah)

 Now we rollin' on, stayin' out all night 
 Stayin' out all night, stayin' out all night 
 Getting drunk, stayin' out all night 
 Stayin' out all night, stayin' out all night 
 Crashing a party, stayin' out all night 
 Stayin' out all night, stayin' out all night 
 Getting this money, stayin' out all night 
 Stayin' out all night, stayin' out all night 
 Leaving all my problems at the door 
 Pouring up, soon as you think it's enough they bringin' more 
 Hanging onto what niggas told me "get your paper up" 
 You work hard for what you got, they could never take it from you 
 All you need is a little patience, let me demonstrate 
 All my niggas in the game, we talkin' 'cause we been through it 
 Rolling weed in raw papers, taking shots, gin got me faded 
 If I get back to your spot, won't know how I made it 
 Now I made my way in the game 
 So much money, don't know how a nigga stayin' the same 
 I'm too straight, I get high all day, I take it straight to the brain 
 I stay fly all week, like seven days on a plane 
 Came here to spend it not leave with it 
 Like KK rolled up, let my team hit it 
 Some Bombay, let's sip till it's mayday 
 That fuck shit don't play 
 I had so much champagne up in the club 
 And ain't come up here tonight looking for love 
 I'mma leave all my problems out on the floor 
 I'mma drink so much that I can't make it home 
 So would you take me home? (Yeah)

 Yeah, keep the good times rollin' and the champagne pourin' 
 On the plane and I don't know where I'm goin' 
 Make sure my team keep ballin' and the hoes keep callin' 
 And the money keep fallin' on the floor 
 Where you tryna go, only care about what's in your drink 
 You tryna go hard, don't think about tomorrow 
 Don't care about what people think 
 You don't care about waitin' outside 
 You be with everybody up in the front 
 You yellin' "face down, ass up" up in the club 
 And now we turning up (let's party) 
 I'm in the club rolling weed like I'm Marley 
 Smoking dearly departed 
 That's kill, too real, come to me get it started 
 And The bottles be poppin' like its 4th of July 
 We just pourin' them shots, back shooting corks in the sky 
 Pouring some for the girls, and pouring more for my guys 
 'Cause we made it my niggas, I just wanna thank my niggas 
 Hear niggas talking shit, but they ain't my niggas 
 Now we rollin' on, stayin' out all night 
 Stayin' out all night, stayin' out all night 
 Getting drunk, stayin' out all night 
 Stayin' out all night, stayin' out all night 
 Crashing a party, stayin' out all night 
 Stayin' out all night, stayin' out all night 
 Getting this money, stayin' out all night 
 Stayin' out all night, stayin' out all night 
 I had so much champagne up in the club 
 And ain't come up here tonight looking for love 
 I'mma leave all my problems out on the floor 
 I'mma drink so much that I can't make it home 
 So would you take me home? (Yeah)
