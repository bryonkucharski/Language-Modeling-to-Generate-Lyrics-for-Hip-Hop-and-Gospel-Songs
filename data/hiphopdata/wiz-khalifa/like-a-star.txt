Riding something butter soft, interior smoked out 
 See you try to budget yours. Me? I don't care what it costs 
 Blowing hella cake I'm switching states to get my numbers off 
 Spin the parking lot and fuck the finest thing I come across 
 Phone full of missed calls 
 Keep some bitches on my line 
 Conscious with my conversation, caking is my occupation 
 Keep them 'rillos rolling up, filled to the tipple 
 Good weed and I blow it by the zip, I'm in my whip 
 Riding weed and switching lanes, cruising to my newest shit 
 Hoes been acting funny so I'm fucking with my newest bitch 
 Everything designer on, 
 Diamonds look like Lemonheads 
 On the beach with foreign freaks, you tricking with them chickenheads? 
 Gotta get my bread (bread) so I hardly sleep at night 
 I do a show to studio, I'm just in time to catch a flight 
 Young but I'm paid, it comes from grinding everyday 
 And having patience, blowing Master Kush in my spaceship 
 Cruising with my hat back, tat-tat-tatted up 
 Gucci on my loafers 
 Getting chauffeured now my status up 
 Paid to cost, I'm the thinnest boss, fuck them other guys 
 Blowing weed I'm never sober, you can't tell me otherwise 
 Name well known, ranked at the top 
 Bad bitch in every city, big face on the watch 
 Kush on my clothes 
 Big bank in my knot 
 Smoke a hundred cigarillos, pullin straight up out a pillow 
 Now I'm eating, staplin in cases for my pillows (?) 
 To my city I'm a prince so I sit behind tints 
 Mad I found an avenue to get my revenue 
 I'm with a model bitch cheifing in a tailor made suit 
 Taylor Gang president, heavy hustle under boss 
 In my car blowing smoke signals out the roof 
 Money conversation talking paper then come fuck with me 
 I'm in the air, that's why you look up to me, you know?
