They ain't got nothing on you, 
 I swear them hoes, they ain't got nothing on you 
 That nigga broke, he ain't got nothing for you 
 I swear these hoes, they ain't got nothing on you 
 I fuck with you 'cause you're very loyal 
 And you're so fine, you make my blood boil 
 I have to go and get another lawyer 
 She took the charge, they ain't got nothing on her 
 I swear to god they ain't got nothing on her 
 Huh, wiz in the airport, she got something on him 
 We ball out in the mall in California 
 We might just pull up in twin Californias 
 They ain't got nothing on you, 
 They ain't got nothing on you, 
 They ain't got nothing on you, 
 Hoes ain't got nothing on you 
 I think that shit just paranoia 
 She think I'm with another woman 
 Another woman that gon' keep me comin' 
 Girl, these hoes, they ain't got nothing on you 
 It's nothing, Claim they are, but you bluffin' 
 Come home and I hit it hard, and she gives me head that's concussion 
 I'm stunting, og kush what I'm puffin 
 In the club you know me, I spend it all 
 My homies gon' get to bustin' 
 Got a quarter million to spend 
 Just came home from tour and I crushed it 
 Just bought my wife a pair of glass shoes, 
 Cause her ass thick as a pumpkin 
 They ain't got nothing on her 
 She don't want no other nigga, she fuckin' with a stoner 
 And if I'm up in this bitch, then I'm prolly with the owner 
 Hella bottles, hella marijuana, anything you want, my niggas got it 
 We got liquor, we got mollies, we got bitches tryina ride, taking pictures 
 We just standing on the couches, they could try but 
 They ain't got nothing on her, 
 They ain't got nothing on you, 
 They ain't got nothing on you, 
 Hoes ain't got nothing on you 
 I think that shit just paranoia 
 She think I'm with another woman 
 Another woman that gon' keep me comin' 
 Girl, these hoes, they ain't got nothing on you 
 I fuck with shawty 'cause she very loyal 
 We can tie the knot like Memph and Toya 
 I won't ignore you and I won't divorce you 
 Let's have two girls and call them Rose and Porsche 
 I respect that girl, I accept that girl 
 I'll do anything I can to protect that girl 
 If I could do it all again, would have kept that girl 
 But I'm unhealthy for you baby I fuck up your world 
 You your Daddy's lil' girl, but you's a grown lady 
 And I don't see you like he see you 'cause we not related 
 We got faded at my spot, I swear we're so wasted 
 After the third shot of patron, I swear can't even taste it 
 They ain't got nothing on you, 
 They ain't got nothing on you, 
 They ain't got nothing on you, 
 Hoes ain't got nothing on you 
 I think that shit just paranoia 
 She think I'm with another woman 
 Another woman that gon' keep me comin' 
 Girl, these hoes, they ain't got nothing on you.
