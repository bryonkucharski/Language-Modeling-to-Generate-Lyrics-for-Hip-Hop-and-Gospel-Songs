She's about to earn some bragging rights 
 I'm 'bout to give it up like I've been holding back all night 
 Girl, take pride in what you want to do 
 Even if that means a new man every night inside of you 
 Baby, I don't mind 
 You can tell by how I roll 
 Cause my clique hard and my cup cold 
 My talk slurred 'cause I'm so throwed 
 And I'm wiping sweat from my last show 
 And he's TG and I'm XO 
 I'm only here for one night 
 And I'mma be your memory 
 Say it in my ear, so I can hear what you're saying to me 
 I got cups full of that Rose 
 Smoke anything that's passed to me 
 Don't worry 'bout my voice 
 I won't need it for what I'm about to do to you 
 Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you 
 I'mma have to take your number when I'm through with you 
 All I ask of you is try to earn my memory 
 Make me remember you like you remember me 
 Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you 
 I'mma have to take your number when I'm through with you 
 All I ask of you is try to earn my memory 
 Make me remember you like you remember me 
 Old rapping ass 
 Lightyears past the class 
 Hit it, don't have to pass 
 Nigga, we the new Aftermath 
 Niggas after fame, I just had to laugh 
 Niggas after fame, I'm after cash 
 You's a fan, I'm a player 
 I'm the man, you's a hater 
 And I only smoke papers 
 That's how you tell I'm Taylor'd 
 Nigga listen 
 Break it down, rolling weed on the island of my kitchen 
 And not a thing goes down without permission 
 Look, everything I got on I was made for 
 Everything that I got I done came for 
 All the shit that you see I done slaved for 
 All the cars and the crib, yeah that's paid for 
 Need I say more 
 Spend so much money on clothes 
 Said fuck a store, making my own 
 I hope that you're rolling one up while you're singing along 
 And know I was rolling one while I was making this song 
 Pour out some shots 
 You're taking too long 
 Young and I'm rich 
 And plus all of my friends on that Bombay and lemonade 
 Good to you 
 Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you 
 I'mma have to take your number when I'm through with you 
 All I ask of you is try to earn my memory 
 Make me remember you like you remember me 
 Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you 
 I'mma have to take your number when I'm through with you 
 All I ask of you is try to earn my memory 
 Make me remember you like you remember me 
 I'm on some gin, you on some gin 
 I'm moving slow, I'm driving fast 
 I hit the weed, you take the wheel 
 We lose control 
 Drop the top in that 69 
 And that motor roar in that old Chevelle 
 Can't say a thing, how you supposed to feel 
 Stacking all of this paper, dawg 
 I like to call this shit old news 
 It means haters jocking our old moves 
 Popping champagne 'cause we made it 
 Back of the Phantom, we faded 
 All of this shit that I did I probably won't remember tomorrow 
 Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you 
 I'mma have to take your number when I'm through with you 
 All I ask of you is try to earn my memory 
 Make me remember you like you remember me 
 Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you 
 I'mma have to take your number when I'm through with you 
 All I ask of you is try to earn my memory 
 Make me remember you like you remember me
