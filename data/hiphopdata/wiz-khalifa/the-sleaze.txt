This here I'm going insane, mental disease 
 Puttin' a bar up to a place, niggas can't reach 
 Bout to cop so many chains, li'l Mr. T 
 The way she give me brain, she needed degree 
 She dropped it to the floor, she did it for the cheese 
 Told her that I need some more, she did it with sleaze 
 Clique full of G's 
 And they go ape, don't swing through the trees 
 Tried, them triggers will squeeze 
 Did it with sleaze 
 And your wifey love a nigga with sleeves 
 Hit it and leave 
 I ain't stressing, when will you niggas believe 
 Shit is a breeze 
 Give me the keys 
 Just got the newest thang, get it with ease 
 Hopped up out the bed, did it with sleaze 
 They say I run the game, literally 
 I'm walking to the bank, get it with sleaze 
 My car is sleazy, my squad is sleazy 
 My job is sleazy, its way too easy 
 Just got the newest thang, get it with ease 
 Hopped up out the bed, did it with sleaze 
 Ain't too much hustling 
 Get it go straight to the bank, my nigga I can't get enough of it 
 Ashes all over my jeans, if this shit stank I'm puffing it 
 Trying to do shit just like Puff did it 
 Dirty ass game, ain't no loving it 
 That nigga hates, bitches lovin' it 
 They say I run the game 
 Got fortune, fuck the fame 
 My garage is like a showroom 
 Couple ounces in my brain 
 Damn she fine, thick as can be 
 Buy me all the newest things, ma this dick ain't for free 
 Everywhere I go I'm weed scented 
 Rock crew necks ripped jean with em 
 Take no swag, mix sleaze with it 
 Take your ho, spend cheese with us 
 Everywhere I go, my weeds in it 
 My crew-necks reps jeans with it 
 Take no swag, mix sleaze with it 
 Taylor Gang, we beast with it 
 Just got the newest thang, get it with ease 
 Hopped up out the bed, did it with sleaze 
 They say I run the game, literally 
 I'm walking to the bank, get it with sleaze 
 My car is sleazy, my squad is sleazy 
 My job is sleazy, its way too easy 
 Just got the newest thang, get it with ease 
 Hopped up out the bed, did it with sleaze 
 Taylor Gang 
 If you real badass, you know what the fuck I'm talking bout 
 Fuck the rules, we make our own 
 I'm my own boss 
 I count my own money 
 I fire the fuck out of you niggas If I feel like it 
 And I'm sleazy as hell 
 Feel me? 
 Just got the newest thang, get it with ease 
 Hopped up out the bed, did it with sleaze 
 They say I run the game, literally 
 I'm walking to the bank, get it with sleaze 
 My car is sleazy, my squad is sleazy 
 My job is sleazy, its way too easy 
 Just got the newest thang, get it with ease 
 Hopped up out the bed, did it with sleaze
