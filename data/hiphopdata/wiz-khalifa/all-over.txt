Set, where haven't we been yet 
 Jet Set, where haven't we been yet 
 Jet Set, where haven't we been yet 
 Jet Set, where haven't we been yet 
 Getting money all over the world, all over the world 
 (Toronto and Amsterdam, Brazil, Paris, France and Japan, anything for the grands, yeah) 
 Getting money all over the world, all over the world 
 (Germany to Italy, North South Pole, anywhere in between, anything for the green) 
 [Curren$y]: 
 Spitta, spend gettin' on beat 
 Red carpet, yo bitch my date 
 She throwin' the Jets and that pit we take her, upload 'em with a song on now right today 
 Those niggas is not like the planes 
 Them hoes don't digg em, they tryna get on my team 
 And how can you blame, she know self preservation 
 The first rule, she know she'd die of boredom if she with you 
 While I'm sitting poolside looking real cool 
 With a Grape flavored 50 cent juice 
 Made for one, the corner store lady gimme two 
 Nigga that's love, that's what I live on 
 Right before take off, twitter from the cell phone 
 Another show rock, more money got work than Chris and Neef, Can't Stop Wont Stop, yeah 
 Getting money all over the world, all over the world 
 (Toronto and Amsterdam, Brazil, Paris, France and Japan, anything for the grands, yeah) 
 Getting money all over the world, all over the world 
 (Germany to Italy, North South Pole, anywhere in between, anything for the green, yeah) 
 [Wiz]: 
 C'mon, I go straight where the cash is 
 Heard about your last date being tragic 
 I know, my last tape was a classic 
 So all I hear now is paper or plastic 
 Few Rosays, now you drunk saying boy "why you in my face and you only want one thing?" 
 You wasting your time fucking lames 
 Only 2 things poppin', that's Jet Set and The Gang 
 Eating sushi, few groupies, new clothes and left over room keys 
 And where my good girls to smoke weed and love playing Nintendo Wii 
 And I got pictures in my cell phone, iChat 
 When I'm gone, land somewhere calling home 
 Put me right up where the best at 
 Nigga we Jet Set, so where haven't we been yet? yes 
 Getting money all over the world, all over the world 
 (Toronto and Amsterdam, Brazil, Paris, France and Japan, anything for the grands, yeah) 
 Getting money all over the world, all over the world 
 (Germany to Italy, North South Pole, anywhere in between, anything for the green, yeah)
