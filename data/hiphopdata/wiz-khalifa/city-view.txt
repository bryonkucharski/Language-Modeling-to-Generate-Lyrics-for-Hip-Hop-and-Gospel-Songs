This shit ain't as easy as it looks nigga 
 It's way fucking easier 
 Don't get it twisted bitch 
 But on some real shit though 
 Man these nigga's don't want it 
 Riding in the car in the (?) 
 Nigga that's stuntin' 
 Gettin' all this paper 
 Got me shittin' in public 
 That roof with a city view 
 I did that from nothing 
 And these nigga's keep hating me 
 But I'm just gonna keep stackin' up 
 No one thing I'll never change 
 I talk shit but I back it up 
 You nigga's don't go hard as me 
 So why the fuck you mad at us 
 I'm rolling up the (?) weed 
 The first one wasn't fat enough 
 Your car don't go fast enough 
 You don't fly first class enough 
 You don't do no switching states 
 You don't do no packing up 
 All you do is gassin' up 
 That's why you aren't past enough 
 Smokin' weed and crackin' up 
 All this cheese I'm racking up 
 See one thing about me 
 I've always been about my 
 As soon as you doubt me 
 I show you how hard I grind 
 Yeah I hear they hate me 
 But they do it all the time 
 There's no you without me 
 I know this so I'm not letting go 
 I'm not letting go 
 I'm not letting go 
 I'm not letting go 
 Get it how I live it 
 Get it and don't care how I spend it 
 Swear to god, my credit card ain't got no limit 
 Time is expensive so I spent hundred thousand on my watches 
 Full of diamonds 
 I ain't even reached the top and I'm still climbing 
 I'm still climbing 
 I'm still rhyming 
 Filling up paper with chronic 
 Keeping nigga's out the way 
 Who got the hating shit in common 
 Let's be honest 
 Let's keep it real here 
 My bank is full of comma's 
 I'm talkin' millions 
 And I got no problems 
 Spending what I spent yeah 
 'Cause I'm probably 
 The realest nigga in here 
 Matter of fact I know I am 
 And I know my diamonds are frozen 
 Not to mention my bank overflowin' 
 And I just can't stop I keep goin' 
 See one thing about me 
 I've always been about my 
 As soon as you doubt me 
 I show you how hard I grind 
 Yeah I hear they hate me 
 But they do it all the time 
 There's no you without me 
 I know this so I'm not letting go 
 I'm not letting go 
 I'm not letting go 
 I'm not letting go
