Fall asleep 
 Fall asleep 
 I got a crib so fat that 
 You'll get lost in that bitch 
 I got a car so fast that if I push one button, you won't see nothin' 
 I got a feelin' that if it wasn't for me it wouldn't be a lot of you niggas 
 Well copy this then 
 Spend a million, count another million boy 
 Fall asleep 
 Fall asleep 
 Fall asleep 
 Fall asleep

 I woke up in Hawaii today 
 For real, I hold dope 
 None, these little young niggas try me today 
 Uh, cause between all of these closets and all of these boxes I got 
 Ooh, I got so much swag 
 That the people at the airport don't even wanna touch my bag 
 Only nigga in first class 
 Fall asleep 
 Fall asleep 
 Fall asleep 
 And I roll that weed and get baked off 
 Before the plane even take off, nigga I 
 Fall asleep 
 Catch me on the road gettin' money 
 I'm in a whole different country by the time I 
 Fall asleep 
 Fall asleep 
 I'm flyer than most of 'em 
 They try and hate, but most love 'em 
 Them dollars, got most of 'em 
 Thanks to who supplyin' what I'm rollin' up 
 All this kush in my mind got me slowin' up 
 Don't gotta smoke, I get high enough for both of us 
 Get a O and blow and get another O and blow another O
