Yeah it's real shit 
 Let me roll this weed up and wrap this shit, you know 
 Too much purple for me 
 Uh, coming up I always thought I'd be the runner up 
 Gave my all but it felt like it wasn't enough 
 I remember spending summers in the studio 
 My pops told me have fun be a kid for once 
 What he ain't know, was for a kid a that I had big dreams 
 I take a small frame turn it into a big screen 
 Taking best friends turn them to a good team 
 I'm watching Scarface living all the good scenes 
 Burning dope thinking about the days when I was broke 
 Desperate niggas in my city don't know how to cope 
 Young nigga said he starving he ain't got a meal 
 Down to catch a body all about a dollar bill 
 My niggas is all I got so it's more than trust 
 We ain't even have a car we was on the bus 
 Public transportation now it's underground we make it 
 Throw it in the safe I can't hear what they say 
 I'm packing up my bags 
 Packing up my bags, packing up my bags 
 I gotta catch a plane 
 Gotta catch a plane, gotta catch a plane 
 I can't be at home 
 Can't be at home, can't be at home 
 I gotta be away 
 Gotta be away, gotta be away 
 Theirs just way to many niggas I use to know back in the day 
 Now when I see them out 
 I just don't got shit to say to you niggas 
 When I see you in the club I make my way through you niggas 
 You must be mad I ain't wait on you 
 But no matter the circumstances I never (?) on you 
 I'm just taking all my dream trying to make it facts 
 Putting on for my team trying to make it crack 
 Getting all sorts of green trying to make a stack 
 Lose yourself in my city and never make it back 
 Said he will but the chances are he will never change 
 Daddy sold dope but you would probably do the same thing 
 If I get $30K I would probably spend it on my wrist 
 Fuck these politics when these kids ain't have a pot to piss 
 Fuck the Promises, the shit I'm on is common sense 
 If you ain't talking them I'm gone 
 I'm packing up my bags 
 Packing up my bags, packing up my bags 
 I gotta catch a plane 
 Gotta catch a plane, gotta catch a plane 
 I can't be at home 
 Can't be at home, can't be at home 
 I gotta be away 
 Gotta be away, gotta be away 
 Say hello, my name is Sebastian 
 Hello, my name is Sebastian 
 Do you love your daddy?
