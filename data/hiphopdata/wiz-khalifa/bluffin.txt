Talkin' big money, bitch, uh 
 That little shit you talkin' 'bout 
 That's lunch money 
 We don't even smoke that, I got-I got-I got-I got so much (so much) 
 And this shit gon' be like this for uh I got so much (so much) 
 Pretty much the rest of the time we here I got-I got-I got-I got so much (much) 
 My little niggas got more money than you fuck niggas man, I promise 
 I got so much, quarter million, little nigga I was nineteen 
 Had my hustle down pat I did the right thing 
 They don't move that fast they act like they don't like cheese 
 Had a couple niggas mad like they don't like me 
 Is it 'cause I'm hella paid? I think it might be 
 Yeah my pockets hella straight 
 And I smoke so much dope I got OG in my IV 
 So many niggas jackin' that shit don't even surprise me 
 I don't even want it back, shit it's off to the good 
 Can't even say I didn't know you would 
 Make a little money, get it from the bro 
 Bring that shit back to the hood 
 Anytime you see me, man I'm on the grind 
 Nigga wasn't workin' when you knew you should 
 Now you talk about me when I'm on the road 
 And when I ride by I'm in the newest one 
 I got so much money I think I should pay for all this 
 They ain't down to spend how much they say 'cause they ain't ballin' 
 I got so much paper I just spend it like it's nothin' 
 Ain't no way they spend how much they say 'cause they just bluffin' 
 I got so much money I think I should pay for all this 
 They ain't down to spend how much they say 'cause they ain't ballin' 
 I got so much paper I just spend it like it's nothin' 
 Ain't no way they spend how much they say 'cause they just bluffin', I got so much 
 Big money 
 Even larger crib 
 No I ain't just stuntin' 
 That's how I'm supposed to live 
 I move fast paced 
 So I drive faster cars 
 Take a look outside 
 Those are really ours 
 And we're really stars we all travel safe and go really far 
 In that custom paint, in that suede floor 
 In that California, that's really hard 
 In that California, that's what we on 
 Smell that strong, you know I'm baked 
 Chances dog, that's what we take 
 How much you hate, that's what we make 
 Roll up one, that's what we face 
 Lot of y'all claim that you real, gon' show up fake 
 But that shit don't mean a thing 
 'Cause I'll still be on my grind 
 And stackin' all of this change 
 I got so much money I think I should pay for all this 
 They ain't down to spend how much they say 'cause they ain't ballin' 
 I got so much paper I just spend it like it's nothin' 
 Ain't no way they spend how much they say 'cause they just bluffin' 
 I got so much money I think I should pay for all this 
 They ain't down to spend how much they say 'cause they ain't ballin' 
 I got so much paper I just spend it like it's nothin' 
 Ain't no way they spend how much they say 'cause they just bluffin', I got so much 
 Don't even gotta ask if I get enough, cause, I got so much 
 Gin in my cup, twenty-two cones I'mma stuff lightin' another one up (I got-I got-I got-I got so much) 
 Live it up, every dollar spend it up 
 Don't even gotta ask if I get enough, cause (I got so much) 
 Gin in my cup, twenty two cones I'mma stuff lightin' another one up, cause 
 I got so much money I think I should pay for all this 
 They ain't down to spend how much they say 'cause they ain't ballin' 
 I got so much paper I just spend it like it's nothin' 
 Ain't no way they spend how much they say 'cause they just bluffin' 
 I got so much money I think I should pay for all this 
 They ain't down to spend how much they say 'cause they ain't ballin' 
 I got so much paper I just spend it like it's nothin' 
 Ain't no way they spend how much they say 'cause they just bluffin', I got so much (I got so much) 
 Hey man, green is for the money, gold is for the honeys 
 Step up your game or step down 
 Whenever a problem troubles us all 
 If you trust in the Lord there will be a brighter tomorrow 
 For there's nothing too much for the great God to do 
 And all that he asks and expects of you 
 Is faith that's unshaken by tribulation and yield 
 Confidence and knowledge that God knows best 
 And trouble and sorrow, they are only a test 
 But without God testin' of our soul 
 It never could reach the ultimate goal 
 So keep on knowing and believing 
 All that God has promised you would be yours to receive 
 Preach, Church, tabernacle 
 Wiz! Wiz! That's the way 
 Wiz! Wiz! That's the way 
 Wiz! Wiz! That's the way
