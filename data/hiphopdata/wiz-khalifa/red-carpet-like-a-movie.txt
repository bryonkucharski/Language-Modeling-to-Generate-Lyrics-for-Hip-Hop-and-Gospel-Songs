Yeah, getting more scrill, deal or no deal, uh 
 Yeah, chubby bags, heavy hustle, 'course the gang, uh 
 On and on, and on, and on and 
 We just drink and smoke until the morning 
 Your home girl's texting you, ignoring them 
 Hit the weed, giggle a little then you get horny 
 I hit the weed, get on my mission and then I'm going in 
 Knowing damn well they got boyfriends 
 Till they get the front door, asked her which floor I'm on 
 I'm at the top, polo socks and pajamas on 
 She smoke chronic, know the lyrics to all my songs 
 It's like I died and went to heaven, me and all my dogs 
 That's why we sip champagne till the bottles gone 
 Roll weed on ya, take the bitches, I don't follow y'all 
 I can never make up this if I wanted to 
 It's real talk what I'm saying to you 
 I don't wanna wake up knowing just one thought of you 
 Got me fallin', I can't get up 
 So will you co-star with me? 'Cause my life is like a movie 
 Champagne parties in my hotel 
 Her friends don't even smoke but they digging the smell 
 Ex boyfriend ringing ya cell but every effort to save you's to no avail 
 Nutting but starter's on my team, nigga, coach fail 
 And all we do is get high and watch Adult Swim 
 Relatively fly like a meteor or spaceship 
 Party every night and early morning get wasted 
 All the way 100, you others niggas are make shift 
 Roll that rapper weed, you smoke and don't wanna taste it 
 Let's face it, she wanna fly where the planes is 
 Got her testing out all of my trees, mint-flavors 
 She [Incomprehensible] the paper 
 I can never make up this if I wanted to 
 It's real talk what I'm saying to you 
 I don't wanna wake up knowing just one thought of you 
 Got me fallin', I can't get up 
 So will you co-star with me? 'Cause my life is like a movie 
 I can never make up this if I wanted to 
 It's real talk what I'm saying to you 
 I don't wanna wake up knowing just one thought of you 
 Got me fallin', I can't get up 
 So will you co-star with me? 'Cause my life is like a movie 
 We stay smoking that la, la, la, easy rider, joint roller, my 9 to 5 
 You can prolly smell it in the car when we riding by 
 More like all the way up, we ain't kinda high 
 We more than fly, introduce you to the gang members 
 That's Taylor like blood, no gang members 
 No names enter and now you on champagne land 
 I'm on an island of hard liquor, it be fans, joint lit and guitar pickers 
 Going nowhere for awhile, I got good snickers 
 Now you wanna mingle, heard young single 
 Big face chips, baby, stack my Pringles 
 You call it tight, I say well fit 
 And we ain't taking no prisoners, now you jealous 
 In ya state please make sure the weed great 
 Fresh produce, purple and green crates 
 Groove, crisp bills in my jean pants 
 Telly room, prolly doing the Uncle Snoop dance, yeah 
 I can never make up this if I wanted to 
 It's real talk what I'm saying to you 
 I don't wanna wake up knowing just one thought of you 
 Got me fallin', I can't get up 
 So will you co-star with me? 'Cause my life is like a movie 
 I can never make up this if I wanted to 
 It's real talk what I'm saying to you 
 I don't wanna wake up knowing just one thought of you 
 Got me fallin', I can't get up 
 So will you co-star with me? 'Cause my life is like a movie
