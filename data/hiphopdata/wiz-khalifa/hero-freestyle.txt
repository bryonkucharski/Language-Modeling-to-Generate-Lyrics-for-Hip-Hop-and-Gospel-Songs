Its yoooouuuung Khalifa man 
 Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh 
 Alot of y'all thinkin' its yo time but I'll tell you it's Taylor Gang season 
 I got 'em mad so they tryna talk bad but I don't care cause motherfucker I'm eatin' 
 And my city got faith in me 'cause I give 'em someone to believe in 
 They tell me I'm a hero 
 A young motherfuckin hero 
 The best when I'm flowin', get goin', no way I can stop 
 Superhuman strength but don't show it so call me Hancock 
 Benny off of Sandlot, I pick on the Beast 
 Represent my city streets when I shit all over beats 
 Young Pete Park how I stick to a track, man 
 The way I make hits you should call me the Batman 
 I'm more like a Jetson cause nigga I'm spacely 
 I'm eatin' like Pac-Man you playin' like Jackson 
 A role model but gotta keep me some weeds whirled 
 Ridin' with a superhero dime I call her G girl 
 Know I'm a star my car's parked out of the world 
 And my diamonds kind of remind lil mama of sea world 
 Homie you niggas got zero 
 They say they need someone to come and save the game and I'ma motherfuckin' (hero) 
 A young motherfuckin' (hero) 
 No cape, I'm tatted up to my face 
 I know more than half of you niggas fake 
 Like the mystery men roll a swisher sweet then 
 I gets ill T. Milli tell 'em I'm bad news 
 I straight run this shit, punisher, Frank Castle 
 I'm Tony without the iron suit 
 I put that motherfucker on ain't no tellin' where I'm goin' 
 Got my pedal to the floor, you'll never be in my lane 
 Can't remember my name they notice me from my chain, lets go 
 I'm Young Wizzle, I'ma keep this thing poppin' 
 This year my CD gone be the sickest thing droppin' 
 Makin' money off of rap you niggas need options 
 The way I get that green they say I be green goblin 
 I became boss man, y'all remain lame now I'm somewhere gettin' tan smokin' swisher sweets, coughin' 
 Fresh like a body, yeah a body in a coffin 
 Might as well take you back to '97 I'm the bomb like bl-ow 
 Alot of y'all thinkin' its yo time but I'll tell you it's Taylor Gang season 
 I got 'em mad so they tryna talk bad but I don't care cause motherfucker I'm eatin' 
 And my city got faith in me 'cause I give 'em someone to believe in 
 They tell me I'm a hero 
 A young motherfuckin hero
