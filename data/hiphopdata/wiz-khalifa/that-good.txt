(Wiz Khalifa) 
 I'm smoking everywhere I go 
 (No stick, no seeds, just Al Green) 
 I always gotta keep one rolled 
 (I keep that, need that, got that) 
 I'm rolling every gram I own 
 (That purp, that bomb, that kush) 
 Don't gotta understand, they know 
 I smoke that, fire that, good that good that 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Concentrated, everyday I'm faded 
 Tree's prepared and properly cultivated 
 I nursed ?em, sprayed down, no chemicals 
 Just me and my buddy, ya hear me now 
 Never treat ya wrong, to each his own 
 Snoop and Wiz the new Cheech and Chong 
 We up in smoke, making street schemes 
 Smoking sticky green, having sweet dreams 
 Break it down, put it in the zig zag 
 And pull the top back and let the ass drag 
 Hit the switch, quickest way to get a bitch 
 Executive branch, get a whiff of this 
 Black car, sack a dank 
 High school n-gga what the f-ck you think 
 I'm passing all my classes with flying colors 
 And everyday I'm high as a muthaf-cker 
 (Wiz Khalifa) 
 Sun roof open, smoking while I'm rolling 
 My bitches only notice it if its potent 
 Bottle of Perignon, we can go kick it by the ocean 
 Get in between your legs 
 Join roaches and ashes all in your bed 
 You calling her babe, she calling me instead 
 'Cause I put that game all in her hair 
 She saw the crib, she know that I'm balling 
 When he ain't have nothing he used to stall em 
 Now I with the boss dogg, all the bad hoes want him 
 And my pockets on swole, I'm talking Rick Ross big 
 And now when we shop we don't care what the cost is 
 Rolling up good, smoking that bomb shit 
 Blow a whole OZ, n-gga that's boss shit 
 Now she all f-ck her man, rubberbands in my pocket 
 Getting money, going hard for my profit 
 Bad bitch keep the joint stuffed like stockings 
 Young n-gga getting bread, why knock it 
 I'm smoking everywhere I go 
 (No stick, no seeds, just Al Green) 
 I always gotta keep one rolled 
 (I keep that, need that, got that) 
 I'm rolling every gram I own 
 (That purp, that bomb, that kush) 
 Don't gotta understand, they know 
 I smoke that, fire that, good that good that 
 In highschool, we do just like we like to 
 We cordially invite you 
 Now roll up get high to it 
 We welcome you to highschool 
 We do just like we like to 
 We cordially invite you 
 Now roll up get high to it 
 Get high to it 
 I'm smoking everywhere I go 
 (No stick, no seeds, just Al Green) 
 I always gotta keep one rolled 
 (I keep that, need that, got that) 
 I'm rolling every gram I own 
 (That purp, that bomb, that kush) 
 Don't gotta understand, they know 
 I smoke that, fire that, good that good that
