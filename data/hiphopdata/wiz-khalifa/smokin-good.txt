I'm a cigarello fiend smokin' weed like it's oxygen 
 Roll a lot skunk, need some blunts, get two boxes in 
 Goin' to pull my stash, out rollin' out this half ounce 
 Puff pass, nigga I puff grass till I pass out 
 I'm a cigarello fiend smokin' weed like it's oxygen 
 Roll a lot skunk, need some blunts, get two boxes in 
 Goin' to pull my stash, out rollin' out this half ounce 
 Puff pass, nigga I puff grass till I pass out 
 Half ounce what I got to smoke up in some days 
 Yeah I choke up and get blazed 
 Eyes closed up and get glazed 
 I'll blow some in your face 
 But you ain't hitting nothin' 
 If I'm in here I gotta smoke somethin' nigga 
 Crack a swishy if I'm rollin' up that good 
 And we roll it by the O, yeah I know you wish you could 
 Ain't nothin' funny gettin' money like I should 
 Anywhere I go niggas know I smokin' good 
 I'm smokin' good 
 I'm smokin' good 
 I'm smokin' good 
 I'm smokin' good 
 I'm smokin' good 
 I'm smokin' good 
 I'm smokin' good 
 Niggas know about what young Khalifa into 
 Love to smoke out, a lot of reefer in him 
 Get you skunked out, you know I'm street official 
 When boys gotta problem, you should keep your issue 
 I'm from Pistolvania, where them heaters hit you 
 Out in California, where the weed official 
 And you could tell that I'm a boss 
 Don't really gotta tell you that I'm smokin' good, 
 You smell it through the wall 
 Crack a swishy if I'm rollin' up that good 
 And we roll it by the O, yeah I know you wish you could 
 Ain't nothin' funny gettin' money like I should 
 Anywhere I go niggas know I smokin' good
