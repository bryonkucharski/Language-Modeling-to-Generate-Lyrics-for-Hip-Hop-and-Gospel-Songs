Got you rolling papers, got you rolling papers 
 Got you rolling papers, got you rolling papers 
 Minus the bullshit 
 Got you rolling papers, got you rolling (uh) 
 Can't do it average, you cool and savage 
 Makin' niggas do backflips 
 FaceTime my phone, you be on a jet 
 Roll my spliffs, send me pics every now and then 
 When we met, I could admit, I was just after sex 
 Taught you not to look for results, but trust the process 
 Plus, you got your paper, ain't no nonsense 
 Smoke from the bong intense, when she with you, she over it 
 Faded but focused, I stay posted 
 Hit me up, the case closed, I leave the gate open 
 Know what's good, your chain say "Ocean" 
 Put you on to the finer things 
 Now when you see designer, you keep your composure 
 Send a text, say she comin' over 
 I don't have to send a car, she get her own 'Cause she ain't been sober 
 No panties on, you ain't needin' those Ron O'Neal, Curtis Mayfield 
 Hittin' notes, hit the joint 
 Leave the roach 
 You don't know 
 What you do to me lately 
 I got so much love for ya 
 Want you to know 
 How much that I fuck with you, oh 
 You don't know 
 What you do to me lately 
 Wanna roll one up for ya 
 Want you to come to the back of the club 
 Show some love to a real one (uh) 
 Netflix and extra long spliffs 
 Hit it once, she recognize what the difference is 
 My bottom bitch don't even trip 
 She see me with other chicks 
 She hardly drink, but for me, she'll take a sip 
 Do what you gotta do to pay your rent 
 Only party with lame niggas at they expense 
 I'm talkin' good weed, steak and shrimp 
 Niggas runnin' off of styles that they ain't invent 
 Tried to grab a towel just to hide the scent 
 You smell the kush all through the vent 
 Go through the hallways lookin' innocent 
 I've been a gangster and a gentleman 
 Talk to the boss and not no middlemen 
 Is you with it or against it? 
 Please make a decision 
 Smoke a pound a day, eliminate the competition 
 I'm that nigga, been that nigga 
 Past and present tenses 
 You look good, I need a badder bitch to complement you 
 You don't know 
 What you do to me lately 
 I got so much love for ya 
 Want you to know 
 How much that I fuck with you, oh 
 You don't know 
 What you do to me lately 
 Wanna roll one up for ya 
 Want you to come to the back of the club 
 Show some love to a real one 
 It's a gang thing, it's a gang thing 
 It's a gang thing, it's a gang thing 
 Don't do me like that 
 I'm a star too 
 Sledgro 
 Everywhere that we go 
 We blow it by the 0 
 The K.K., the smoke
