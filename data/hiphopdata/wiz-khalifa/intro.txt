With the hunger of a Chris Wallace back in '94 
 I like to welcome y'all to rock with PG's young ball 
 From the bottom of the pot, yea I'm the Pitts of the Burgh 
 With the kids on the curb, and small time, is pitching the herb 
 I'm back, and those who didn't previously know what I'm crack 
 To the people, I'm legalized the lethal 
 We all got problems involving the rude of evil 
 But they caught me non-dodging, long arming the people, yup! 
 And for the record, I ain't no half stepper 
 I rose from the city of steel, the streets greedy for real 
 Cats chasing their paper, that's basic 
 Mathematics, hate to run the streets but took a staff at it 
 As I look back at hard it seems 
 I remember when this music thing was all but a dream 
 But I'm here for my city 
 And can't name no one that's near fucking with me 
 I'm 'bout to make history
