Gang, gang 
 Gang, gang, gang 
 Gang 
 Leave it to me, I'll have you twisting that weed with a G 
 Got too much talent just to be sittin' around with 
 Weed and alcohol, that's the balance 
 Ridin' in the Benz with low milage 
 Working till my hands get callouses 
 Been a player, I established it 
 Whips be the fastest 
 Chicks be the baddest and my kush above average 
 Legendary status and my crib like a palace 
 I know why they mad 
 'Cause your bitch layin' in my bed 
 Still got the weed smell in her hair 
 Comin' home later, nigga gettin' cares 
 Make a whole pound disappear 
 Come for the money, tryna get a dog 
 Live this for the gang, imma get involved 
 Look at me different now 
 Roll some weed and put your niggas on 
 You ain't 'bout the paper, what you in it for? 
 And my eyes so low, soon as I walk in 
 I got a joint rolled you know that imma spark it 
 That's why I ride so slow, me and my gangsters 
 I hear 'em talkin' like they livin' but they ain't us 
 Pockets, they swole 
 I won't leave here alone, came here with no bitch 
 But when I walk out the door, I might leave here with your bitch 
 Uh, they ain't goin' hard as us 
 We courtside, chillin', smokin' out the building 
 Regardless if authorities give us permission 
 Boss bitches niggas breakin' they credit card limits 
 To try to ball with us 
 We in talks with those who only own business 
 My spark lit, then I paint pictures 
 Don't leave witnesses, nah nigga, my gang different 
 Pull the Benz out in the rain 
 Hit her once, I won't even remember her name 
 Hella diamonds up in my chain 
 To say that I'm dope is an understatement but no, I ain't underrated 
 Came from a place where niggas make their own way 
 Got some girls who fuck me but got niggas so they don't say 
 I'm puttin' KK in the paper 
 On point gang, ready for danger 
 Long joints, rollin' them things like broken fingers 
 Too clean to ever have a stain 
 Khalifa the boss before you beat the game 
 And my eyes so low, soon as I walk in 
 I got a joint rolled you know that imma spark it 
 That's why I ride so slow, me and my gangsters 
 I hear 'em talkin' like they livin' but they ain't us 
 Pockets, they swole 
 I won't leave here alone, came here with no bitch 
 But when I walk out the door, I might leave here with your bitch 
 Pockets is gettin' swole 
 Used to smoke blunts now it's paper she roll 
 Diamonds to my toes 
 Everywhere I go, I'm froze 
 You already know 
 Fool 
 Gangsters too 
 This is how them gangsters do
