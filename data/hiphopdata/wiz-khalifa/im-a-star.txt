Wiz Khalifa 
 See there's a big difference 
 Between the star life, and your life 
 Me, I live the star life 
 You smell it when I come through 
 Johnny Juliano 
 When I come through watch me put my game on 
 Fresh from my head down, big ass chain on 
 This my life and stars shine bright 
 Yeah I am a star, look inside my car 
 They know who I am I'm seeing 'em from afar 
 Don't act like you know, I know just who you are 
 Admit it or you don't cause baby I'm a star 
 Wiz Khalifa 
 Yeah 
 And you know that, but you can't stand it 
 Out of this world I'm from a different planet 
 See how I landed?, big ol' chain on 
 Tight ass white tee, black chuck tays on 
 I make great songs, my shit classic 
 See y'all CD, walk right past it 
 Call me acid that's how I do y'all 
 Heat niggas up till I can see right through y'all 
 Never slipped out, goons right by me 
 Hear niggas talk shit but they don't try me 
 Can't do front door, don't got I.D 
 Straight up the elevator to the V.I.P 
 Drink my drink up, blow my weed smoke 
 Bitch don't say shit, let my team poke 
 Bout my money, you see me grinding 
 There go a hater, you see me shinin'?

 Yeah I am a star, look inside my car 
 They know who I am I'm seeing 'em from afar 
 Don't act like you know, I know just who you are 
 Admit it or you don't cause baby I'm a star 
 Rocks in my charm look like boulders 
 Young and rich so my hoes much older 
 Me I'm cleaned up, tats all over 
 Know I'm getting it. home girl told her 
 No not sober, need my weed lit 
 Keep my blunt rolled, ain't no secret 
 Blow like 3 zips, me and po run 
 Brand new Guccis, big ass chain on 
 Where my plane goin' down Miami 
 Sun gon' tan me, palm trees fan me 
 Takin' pictures where my fans be 
 Niggas sit down, they can't stand me 
 Straight from the Burgh', taylor gang my family 
 Hustle heavy that's why we cakin 
 Get my shine on that's why they hatin' 
 As soon as I pull up y'all can't say shit 
 When I come through watch me put my game on 
 Fresh from my head down, big ass chain on 
 This my life and stars shine bright 
 Yeah I am a star, look inside my car 
 They know who I am I'm seeing 'em from afar 
 Don't act like you know, I know just who you are 
 Admit it or you don't cause baby I'm a star
