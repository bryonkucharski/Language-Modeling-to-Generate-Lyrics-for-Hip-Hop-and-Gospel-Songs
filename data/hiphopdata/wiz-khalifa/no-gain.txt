We started? 
 I've got so much, so much shit to do, don't even know where to start 
 Be here forever. 
 I think that's the plan, yanno? 
 Start here, end up there 
 Soon as you think something's goin' on you start back over 
 It's never gonna be the same 
 I ain't complainin' though 
 I really wouldn't have it any other way 
 Nigga 
 Every day you wake up your destiny depends on what you do 
 Sometimes I roll up when I'm stressed out and sometimes I roll two 
 Here people sayin' shit about the way I am but I know that ain't true 
 At times I feel like I'm all by myself and I know you do too 
 I made some phone calls and checked emails 'cause I'm always grindin' 
 Ain't no rush, I do things slow 'cause it's all about timing 
 Some people think when you get to this point in life you've made it 
 I've seen so many settle for less, that's when talent get wasted 
 I ain't there, but if I can I'mma try to be perfect 
 And for those that's ridin' with me, I'mma try to make it worth it 
 I drink too much, I'm into weed, 'cause it's better for the stress 
 I just woke up, I don't get sleep, boy my schedule's a mess 
 Man I work hard 
 Man I work hard 
 Man I work hard 
 Man I work hard 
 It ain't no game (no pain no gain) 
 (Ain't no gain without bein' no pain) 
 It ain't no game (no pain no gain) 
 (Ain't no gain without bein' no pain) 
 It ain't no game (no pain no gain) 
 (Ain't no gain without bein' no pain) 
 (No pain) 
 Man I work hard 
 Just left another one 
 Just wrote another one 
 Just got another check 
 'Bout to thumb through another one 
 Fallin' asleep on the plane, (?) 
 Them nigga holdin' it down, don't care if it make you uncomfortable 
 Hardly spend nights at the crib, homie that's just how I live 
 Don't even go hard for myself, I got a wife and a kid 
 I don't ever question the biz, nigga it is what it is 
 You niggas ain't killin' shit, no you niggas ain't killin' shit 
 What they doin' it ain't nothin' 
 (?) Nothin' 
 Call my phone, it ain't nothin' 
 I smoke a lot but don't judge me 
 Probably wake up earlier than all of you niggas 
 Mafuckas always hate on the squad, but all the hatin' mafuckas ain't get paid 
 Man I work hard 
 Man I work hard 
 Man I work hard 
 Man I work hard 
 It ain't no game (no pain no gain) 
 (Ain't no gain without bein' no pain) 
 It ain't no game (no pain no gain) 
 (Ain't no gain without bein' no pain) 
 It ain't no game (no pain no gain) 
 (Ain't no gain without bein' no pain) 
 (No pain) 
 Man I work hard
