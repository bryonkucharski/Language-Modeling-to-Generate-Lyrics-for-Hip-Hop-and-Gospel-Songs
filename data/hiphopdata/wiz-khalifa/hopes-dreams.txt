(Wiz Khalifa - Verse 1) 
 Long money, hopes and dreams 
 Always be around them n-ggas wit paper but got your own money 
 It's yo world, buy this drink for you girl 
 You said tell the DJ play this song for me 
 Heres my number case you ever need company 
 Better weed tons of drink, love the way I dress, let her rub my ink 
 Hell yeah, I'm fly, that's why they all beneath, me 
 Got money fall and she make dough 
 I'm giving her all she can take though 
 And you know we ball but this ain't no game no 
 I'm spending it all cause that's what we came for 
 Yeah that's what we came for 
 Throwing my money when I see you every time she gettin' low, low, low, 
 Foot on the gas when I see you yeah 'cause she ready to go, go, go, go 
 (Wiz Khalifa - Verse 2) 
 Throw it in the air watch that paper fall 
 Don't know how much I came here with 
 End of the night, shit, she gon take it all 
 See them diamonds in my chain 
 You ain't gotta know my name 
 Rushing to the bar, I need another round of drinks 
 Then it's to my car, puff a pound of dank 
 Now we in the stars, and I'ma make it rain 
 Drown the sink, 
 Got money fall when she make dough 
 I'm giving her all she can take though 
 And you know we ball but this ain't no game no 
 I'm spending it all cause that's what we came for 
 Yeah that's what we came for 
 Throwing my money when I see you every time she gettin' low, low, low, 
 Foot on the gas when I see you yeah 'cause she ready to go, go, go, go 
 And all them other hoes competing they ain't even coming close, close, close 
 Foot on the gas when I see you yeah 'cause she ready to go, go, go, go 
 (Wiz Khalifa - Verse 3) 
 Pay for your own clothes, fly on your own trips 
 You a big girl, you buy your own shit 
 Supply your own smoke, you like your own zip 
 No leasing yours, you like to own shit 
 So rich, the one them n-ggass hate the bitches wanna go with 
 I'm, buyin O's like it's Wheel of Fortune 
 Feelin' flawless, living lawless, yeah 
 Throwing my money when I see you every time she gettin' low, low, low, 
 Foot on the gas when I see you yeah 'cause she ready to go, go, go, go 
 And all them other hoes competing they ain't even coming close, close, close 
 Foot on the gas when I see you yeah 'cause she ready to go, go, go, go 
 I'm throwing money up and watching her go round and round 
 Watching her go round and round 
 I'm throwing money up and watching it come down, come down 
 Watchin it come down, come down 
 And we can go to my house or we can go to your crib 
 We can jump in your car, you can see how I live 
 But I'm still throwing money up 
 So much I'm losing count, can't count 
 So much I'm losing count, can't count 
 Yeah I'm talkin' bout.
