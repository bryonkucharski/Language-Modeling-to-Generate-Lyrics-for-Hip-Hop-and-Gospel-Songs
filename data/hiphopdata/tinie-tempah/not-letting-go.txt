Tinie Tempah 
 Yes, ah, yo 
 Tinie Tempah 
 Yeah, ready for the summer, girl, your hair looks killa 
 See your batty getting bigger but your waist looks slimmer 
 And I hope I'm still with you when your hair get thinner 
 I ain't gotta work it out, I know I'm onto a winner 
 And I love it when I see you sing a song in the mirror 
 When you play your favourite records where there ain't no filler 
 Chicky-cha, chicky-chicky-cha, Sade, J Dilla 
 Now I'm on the right track, from the train to the limo 
 Now we're on the right track (right track), yeah 
 Used to know me back in college, now I got it like that 
 Could have got the side track, now I'm back on my feet 
 If I hadn't achieved, would you pack up and leave? 
 Now you scratchin' on me like we're Adam and Eve 
 Playing remix to Ignition in the back of the Jeep, ah 
 She like the hook but she don't know the verse 
 She know I love her even if I never say the words 
 Jess Glynne 
 You were something I can't replace 
 You made my heart work 
 You make me stronger 
 I'm not letting go, I'm not letting go 
 You were something I can't replace 
 You made my heart work 
 You make me stronger 
 I'm not letting go, I'm not letting go 
 Jess Glynne 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 I'm not letting go, I'm not letting go 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 I'm not letting go, I'm not letting go 
 Tinie Tempah 
 Livin' in a bubble, we ain't struggling in life 
 Ready for your trouble and a couple of fights 
 Why don't you stay over here and keep me up in the night 
 And when you comin' in here, I'll do you just like you like 
 Girl I'm ready for your loving, girl I keep on falling 
 You my lucky number that I keep on calling 
 Wanna never let me go, she said she fed up of touring 
 Because I kiss her in the night and then I leave in the morning 
 I tell her one, already know she the one 
 She's 22, we in Le Fountain Blu 
 And when she's free, you know she call on me 
 And then I make her take it off and pull it all on me 
 Playing in the sheets, don't sleep tonight 
 Playing R. Kelly "I Believe I Can Fly", yeah 
 She like the hook but she don't know the verse 
 She know I lover her even if I never say the words 
 Jess Glynne 
 You were something I can't replace 
 You made my heart work 
 You make me stronger 
 I'm not letting go, I'm not letting go 
 You were something I can't replace 
 You made my heart work 
 You make me stronger 
 I'm not letting go, I'm not letting go 
 Jess Glynne 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 I'm not letting go, I'm not letting go 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 I'm not letting go, I'm not letting go 
 Tinie Tempah & Jess Glynne 
 Oi my size, I see you're quite shy 
 Guess I'm a sucker for those nice eyes 
 I ain't in it for the money or the fame 
 I'm the one that all the honeys couldn't tame, yo I change 
 (You make my heart work, you make me stronger) 
 You know I changed 
 (This thing we have, it can't be bought or sold, now) 
 Jess Glynne 
 You were something I can't replace 
 You made my heart work 
 You make me stronger 
 I'm not letting go, I'm not letting go 
 You were something I can't replace 
 You made my heart work 
 You make me stronger 
 I'm not letting go, I'm not letting go 
 Jess Glynne 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 I'm not letting go, I'm not letting go 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 I'm not letting go, I'm not letting go
