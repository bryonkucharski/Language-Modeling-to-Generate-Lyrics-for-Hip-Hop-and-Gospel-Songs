 I heard you good with them soft lips 
 Yeah you know word of mouth 
 The square root of 69 is 8 something 
 'Cause I've been try 'na work it out, oooow 
 Good weed, white wine 
 I come alive in the night time 
 Okay, away we go 
 Only thing we have on is the radio 
 Ooh, let it play, say you gotta leave 
 But I know you wanna stay 
 You just waiting on the track to finish girl 
 The things we could do in twenty minutes girl 
 Say my name, say my name 
 Wear it out, it's getting hot, crack a window, air it out 
 I can get you through a mighty long day 
 Soon as I go the text you gone right is gone say...

 Then with your arms around me 
 Back and forth you rock me 
 So I surrender, to every word you whisper 
 Every door you enter, I will let you in

 You 'bout to break me, I swear you got me losing my mind
