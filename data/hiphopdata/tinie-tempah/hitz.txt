I make hitz, not the public 
 I tell the DJ what to play! Understand? 
 I make hitz, not the public 
 I tell the DJ what to play! Understand? 
 Baa baa black sheep, rock star, rap G 
 Make enough dough to own a black card, that's deep 
 I've been getting real fucking friendly with the banks man 
 And I don't mean Phil card or Hilary ya asking 
 P'hapz see me up in the vicinity and flash me 
 I'm the definition of definitive and catchy 
 The only thing that's bigger, quicker, slicker 
 More black and more upper London is a taxi 
 Bitch I'm so sick, I need a mother fucking vaccine 
 Pick your ring style like some other fucking fast weed 
 Centre of attention like a Bang and Olufsen 
 Hey Steevie reaching for a flat screen 
 The only ever time I see you niggers on kisses is like 2am or when you go to pucker up 
 Look 60 GM4 you need to buckle up 
 All my women so soon, all my women so nuts 
 So what and uncut and no fucking edits 
 She won't even get a high if she made no fucking effort 
 And all you silly singers and you ring tone rappers 
 Like school dinner curries 
 Don't fucking get it 
 My car is a unleaded 
 Got a yard with a terrace 
 She called me chauvinistic 
 But she can't even spell it 
 I don't wanna hear another nigga say you fly 
 If you ain't never been on business class on the Emirates 
 I'm a racket, I'm tennis 
 I'm Dennis, I'm a menace 
 Call me Rob Patterson, I got a lot of niggas jealous 
 I'm a mentos mint in a can of Dr Pepper 
 That's tick, tick, tick, tick, boom to you fellas 
 It's so important that your mighty Nigella 
 Ain't listening if her name ain't Remi or stella 
 Got a big bag of chips and Mary Poppin's umbrella 
 'Cause we're 'bout to rain on them like London weather
