(Vadakae Kaetu Paaru Enna Pathi Solluvaan 
 Jarthaar Beda Pole En Paerathaan Melluvaan) 
 They sayin' don't sell out 
 Don't sell out 
 (Kala sa kala sala 
 Kalasala kala sala 
 Kalasa la kalasala) 
 Let's get! 
 I'm 'bout it, you know it 
 Disturb the line then pour it 
 Sparklers as in my Moet 
 If you need the glass and I pour it 
 Fashion week front row it 
 Chelsea and Soho it 
 Better valet park my ... 
 Then the Council come and tow it 
 Rebel Vodka, JD and coke 
 Bitch turn up the radio 
 Heartless press pay as you go 
 Mixed with a little KC' and Jo 
 Now my sex is crazy yo' 
 We don't want the ratio 
 Tryin' to get fellatio 
 From girls as fresh as Daisy Lowe 
 Them girls say Hi, Them girls say Hello 
 I tell 'em stick your number in an envelope 
 She take it off but leave on her stilettos 
 You know you can find me riding white girls like a fellow 
 We say to 'em 
 (x2:) 
 All you're mad you ain't us 
 Hold up when I'm famous, party like in Vegas 
 Yeah that alcohol made us 
 I tell em, tell 'em don't sell out, tell em, tell 'em and don't sell out 
 Tell em, tell 'em and don't sell out, tell 'em and don't sell out 
 Yeah! 
 Tatatata Tiger Beer or Cobra, lime in my Corona? 
 Chase down my bilateral periodical haematoma 
 Livin' la vida loca, I be from Barcelona 
 Life throws me lemons, now Celebrity Juice on my sofa 
 Got girl in Oklahoma, and the LA girl that do yoga 
 A girl in Amsterdam that's a stoner 
 And a sexy female chauffeur 
 And a girl that makes a racket 
 I call her Anna Kournakova 
 In and out the tax bracket 
 So much for my diploma 
 Say what's up? And say what's happening 
 He'll be in the club just racks on racks on racks in 
 Was using words but no were using actions 
 Been around the world, and ladies love me and my London accent 
 We be sayin' to em 
 (x2:) 
 All you're mad you ain't us 
 Hold up when I'm famous, party like in Vegas 
 Yeah that alcohol made us 
 I tell em, tell 'em don't sell out, tell em, tell 'em and don't sell out 
 Tell em, tell 'em and don't sell out, tell 'em and don't sell out 
 Am I drunk? No, am I lean? yes 
 I'll do the roar, no, I'm clean, yes 
 I'll do the tour, and shout 
 Bring out to me, yes 
 Roses could bore, no 
 And sedeem, yes 
 Am I mature? no 
 Should I be, yes 
 Are my jeans still saggy like the queen? 
 And I wear a lot of gold around my V 
 And I sell out all my shows just like they're free 
 We keep on saying to them 
 (x2:) 
 All you're mad you ain't us 
 Hold up when I'm famous, party like in Vegas 
 Yeah that alcohol made us 
 I tell em, tell 'em don't sell out, tell em, tell 'em and don't sell out 
 Tell em, tell 'em and don't sell out, tell 'em and don't sell out
