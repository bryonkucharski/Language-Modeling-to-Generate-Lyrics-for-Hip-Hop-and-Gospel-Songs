They know something special's happening 
 They know something special's happening 
 2010, they were chart toppers 
 2020, they'll be battling 
 Always remind 'em that I'm African 
 Please don't ask me 'bout that crap again 
 Asian tings at the gathering 
 Swear my album's going platinum 
 They know something special's happening 
 They know something special's happening 
 2010, they were chart toppers 
 2020, they'll be battling 
 Always remind 'em that I'm African 
 Please don't ask me 'bout that crap again 
 Asian tings at the gathering 
 Swear my album's going platinum 
 Heard they're tryna take a shot at me 
 I might have to take a stab at them 
 Side chick tried front on me 
 Let me hit it from the back again 
 Friends say that I'm back again 
 The ends say that I'm back again 
 My sensei say I'm back again 
 They know something special's happening 
 Yeah, I've got a lot of actor friends 
 I ain't got a lot of rapper friends 
 I just always sense the jealousy 
 Even from these niggas' management 
 'Cause I'm fresher than a mannequin 
 Your last banger was an accident 
 I can see these haters panicking 
 They know something special's happening 
 Your whole setup is embarrassing 
 The whole scene is what I'm carrying 
 Lost touch with a ting I used to link 
 I heard she went to jail for trafficking 
 Grind up, daddy never put the time in 
 Never told him I was mad at him 
 Left me feeling like I'm Anakin 
 Lamborghini in the garrison 
 Two Ferraris in a new favela 
 I've been riding with the same old crew forever 
 Flying private, tell the pilot "choose the weather" 
 Sunset, tryna choose a Jenner 
 Sunset like I'm Juicy J 
 I was only doing two a day 
 Now I'm doing twenty-two a day 
 My young G's twenty-two today 
 They know something special's happening 
 They know something special's happening 
 Oriental with the Mandarin 
 Journey Mercy when I'm travelling 
 Lord have mercy on these fuckboys 
 Ain't no manners for these sluts, boy 
 2010, they were chart-toppers 
 2020, now their stuff's void
