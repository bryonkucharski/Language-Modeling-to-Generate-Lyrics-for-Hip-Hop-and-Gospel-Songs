Yeah (x3) 
 Eenie meanie minie 
 Thank God it's Friday 
 Please don't ask for my I.D. 
 If I'm in your iTunes library 
 Got my own book library 
 My mansion is so tidy 
 But my neighbours hate my mistress 
 'Cause she never wear no nightie 
 I go claridges to do high tea 
 Jordans on like Spike Lee 
 I'm high end, you're high street 
 Swagger jacking my stylee 
 When I was a kid I used to save up for my Nikes 
 Now all these little kids are trying to save up for my Nikes

 Trampoline 
 Sharing clothes that's trampy 
 Splitting bills that's trampy 
 All this hanky, hanky panky 
 Now her hand prints on my banksy 
 I'm just strictly speaking Anne frankly 
 All my girls is fancy in a white Ferrari Spider 
 Rolling with Anansi and Diplo to disco 
 She sniff Whoa 
 She gwan like she RiRi 
 Wine to calypso 
 She ask me if I'm single 
 I said may be I think so 
 I can't concentrate 
 When that thong on like Sisqo

 First of all swagging 
 Two girls with me so am bragging 
 So much money in ma pocket 
 My pants might be sagging 
 My car migt be tinted 
 My weed might be scented 
 My girl might be bow-legged 
 Her friend might be with her 
 Gold Roley on when I perform 
 Ring, Ring 
 Mobile phone the way it's going off, it must be on 
 Till the break of dawn party like 
 Rock Stars! 
 We don't stop till we see them f-cking cop cars 
 Shake (x7) 
 Tambourine 
 Tan till her skin peel off, tangerine 
 Then she vogue
