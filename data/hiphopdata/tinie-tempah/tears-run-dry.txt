There's nothing to borrow 
 There's no more regrets 
 Your shadows I follow 
 But it's like no one's there 
 But my tears run dry 
 But my tears run dry 
 Oh my fields wont die 
 When your not there 
 So I go 
 Head first into your puddle of tears 
 Heart first into the tunnel of fear 
 Had your very first son at 21 
 Only old enough to be my mum by a couple of years 
 Cuddled all of your kids 
 Soon you'll be cuddling theirs 
 And we always hear our names when you mumble your prayers 
 Remember when you said get a job pick another career 
 But fuck that shit were to humble to care yeah 
 Maybe it's God describing a blessing 
 The truth can be hard to swallow, should I reply to these questions? 
 I'm stuck in the fucking middle on either side of the fences 
 Of all this blinding and f'ing just drive me Down to my session 
 This a mid life crisis is this some kind of depression 
 Like substitute teacher I wanna teach you a lesson ah 
 I think we should live and just let it die 
 I'll just put on my fucking shades to hide the pain in my eyes 
 But my tears run dry 
 But my tears run dry 
 Oh my fields won't die 
 When your not there 
 So I go 
 Standing in front of mirrors that make me look best 
 Rolling on something special to make me forget 
 Mum and Daddy came to this country and gave me the best 
 But all the money in the world ain't replying the debt 
 After taking a cheque my girl got impatient and left 
 Still have a damier canvas case of the ex 
 She sending me the sort of things you don't say in a text 
 I won't even listen to this song 'cause it makes me depressed 
 'Cause I didn't ever do anything to hurt you 
 Feels like I don't have anybody to turn to 
 You were the only woman I let into my circle 
 Closer than Celie and Nettie in the colour purple 
 Saw her the other day she said she's going to nurse school 
 Gave me her BBM and said we should keep it virtual 
 But I think we should just live and just let it die I'll just put on my fucking shades 
 And pretend everything's fine 
 They said I used to have it, guess I got it back 
 They said I fucking lost it, guess I got it back 
 The pot can't call the kettle black 
 Here's a double shot of pride, swallow that 
 Gave your sister my number if you ever wanna chat 
 Heard she gave it you, you never even hollered back 
 Said there was too much on your plate but it wasn't that 
 You was like an email with a file you just got attached 
 Read your article and didn't even need to diss you 
 Cover shoot I hope they put you in a different issue 
 And tell your girl I said mwah ciao and bisou bisou 
 She was on my tour bus for a month and didn't even miss you 
 After the shit we did its crazy if she even kiss you 
 Here's some aloe vera kleenex if you need a tissue 
 I think we should live and just let it die 
 I'll just put on my fucking shades and pretend everything fine 
 They said I used to have it, guess I got it back 
 They said I fucking lost it, guess I got it back 
 The pot can't call the kettle black 
 Here's a double shot of pride swallow that [x2]
