 I'm fucking crazy with the kicks, call me Jean Claude, 
 About to be a bigger star than my mum thought, 
 'Cause every day I got a groupie at my front door, 
 Now I drive past the bus I used to run for, 
 Where's my fucking clap, where's my encore? 
 I walk alone, 'cause I was born alone, 
 I chirps her just for fun, I never ever call her phone, 
 I leave her in the club, I never ever walk her home, 
 DL the fuckin' foundation, I'm the cornerstone,
