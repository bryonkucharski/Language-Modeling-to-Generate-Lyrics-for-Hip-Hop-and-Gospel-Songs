Oh, written in the stars 
 A million miles away 
 A message to the main 
 Oh 
 Seasons come and go 
 But I will never change 
 And I'm on my way 
 (Verse 1 - Tinie Tempah) 
 Let's go 
 Yeah 
 You're listening now 
 They say they ain't heard nothing like this in a while 
 That's why they play my song on so many different dials 
 Because I got more fucking hits than a disciplined child 
 So when they see me everybody brrrrraps, brrrrrraps 
 Man I'm like a young gun fully black Barrack 
 I cried tear drops over the massive attack 
 I only make hits like I work with the racket and bat 
 Look at my jacket and hat 
 So damn berserk 
 So down to Earth 
 I'm bringing gravity back 
 Adopted by the major I want my family back 
 People work hard just to get all their salary taxed 
 Look, I'm just a writer from the ghetto like Malory Black, man 
 Where the help or the sanity at? Damn 
 I used to be the kid that no one cared about 
 That's why you have to keep screaming till they hear you out 
 (Verse 2 - Tinie Tempah) 
 Yeah 
 I needed a change 
 When we ate we never took because we needed a change 
 I needed a break 
 For a sec I even gave up believing and praying 
 I even done the legal stuff and was leaded astray 
 They say the money is the route to the evilest ways 
 But have you ever been so hungry that it keeps you awake? 
 Mate, now my hunger would leave them amazed 
 Great, it feels like a long time coming, fam 
 Since the day I thought of that cunning, plan 
 One day I had a dream I tried to chase it 
 But I wasn't going nowhere, Running Man 
 I knew that maybe someday I would understand 
 Trying to change a ten into a hundred grand 
 Everyone's a kid that no one cares about 
 You just got to keep screaming till they hear you out
