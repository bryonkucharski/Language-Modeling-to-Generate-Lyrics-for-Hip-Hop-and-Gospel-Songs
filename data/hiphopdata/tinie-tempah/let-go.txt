If you can see me, then you're probably a little too close 
 So you think you could love me, well you gotta be stronger than most 
 Cause my ex didn't like it, didn't like it, 
 No my friends they don't like it, they don't like it 
 Somebody remind me 
 When's the right time, when's the right time to let go 
 Uh, dear whoeva the fuck is listening, 
 Tell me of the pleasures of being a normal citizen 
 Cause all these fittins' and Vivians keeping me from fittin' in 
 Why do I feel safer on stage than in my own living room 
 My grandma say that if I leave my drink I shouldn't sip again 
 Ooh this tour has got me feeling tired like I'm itchin' 
 And uh even though it's physical differences in my siblings 
 That's why I feel so down even at the top of the... 
 Uh, dear whoeva the fuck is witnessin', 
 Disturbing London independent black businessman 
 Based on the work and the effort I'm gunna give this year 
 Everybody's getting the presents they want for Christmas, yeah 
 Life is only ninety nine winters 
 So I'm tryna bond with daddy even though I don't like Guinness 
 Don't be confused by my image, I'm no fuckin' public pin-up 
 But my heart won't let me say no to a picture 
 Uh, dear whoeva the fuck is, Fuck it, this is discovery hate it or love it 
 I'm now officially the property of the public since licensing my album 
 And signing a deal to be published 
 But none of these songs are written for me, nor am I a puppet 
 Journalists come for interviews but don't stay on the subject 
 Yeah, no, yeah - are we done yet? 
 Questions you've asked me hundreds, now can you grant me some rest 
 Because I'm tired of it, I'm living out my dream, and I'm tired from it 
 If music needed saving, I'd die for it 
 Music's where my heart is, I'm alive for it 
 I promise 
 If I'm never liked my heart might break 
 Here in the dark, yeah, we'll be safe 
 I don't care, no looking back 
 I've never been, never been, this far from home
