I know you gon' think you're crazy 
 Just a foolish girl 
 But I believe just maybe 
 A heart a heart can save the world 
 A heart a heart heart can save the world 
 I believe a [x2] 
 Imagine if 
 A heart, a heart, a heart can save the world 
 Disturbing London send the whole world our love 
 Where did time go how'd we use the hours up 
 I'm feeling like I can make the stars light up 
 I'm feeling like I can make the stars light up 
 Before I became a star I was wishing I was 
 They used to love me doing well and now it's pissing them off 
 Hope it hurts below the belt like a kick in the crotch 
 Family of refugees is why were killing them soft 
 Yeah time to thicken the plot 
 I know they're wishing they could bottle just a bit of my luck 
 'Cause every time I touch the mic it's like I'm singing for God 
 I give it everything I have I fucking give it a lot 
 Kofi tell the UN we need an immigrant mob 
 Full of blacks, full of Irish, full of women and dogs 
 We need a million man march, only a million can stop 
 Who's gonna come and save the world make sure the villains are got? 
 Tell Mr Cameron and Oprah 
 When people unemployed and they dunno who to vote for? 
 We need a voice bigger than Mariah or Leona 
 A hero a soldier I think we need a donor you know 
 A Heart, a heart, a heart can save the world 
 Yeah you know 
 A Heart, a heart, a heart can save the world 
 A heart a heart heart can save the world 
 I believe a [x2] 
 Imagine if 
 A heart, a heart, a heart can save the world 
 Disturbing every city on the Map this year 
 Know that they can feel it in the atmosphere 
 Lived is just the devil spelt backwards yeah 
 Yeah and I'd rather fast forward than to be in rewind 
 So when you puff puff pass can you keep it alight 
 Heard a heart can save the world do you believe in the hype 
 If you could open up the heavens who'd you see in the sky 
 Lord gimmie a sign, open my eyes 'cause I see the blind leading the blind 
 Kids are having kids who don't know how to read or to write 
 It's 'cause my father was a man he chose to be in my life 
 Had to see an optician helping me with my sight 
 Said don't ever loose the hunger I can see in your eyes 
 I told her give me mouth to mouth because I need to survive 
 Can you perform the CPR that's gonna keep us alive 
 I know you gon' think you're crazy 
 Just a foolish girl 
 But I believe just maybe 
 A heart a heart can save the world 
 A heart, a heart, a heart can save the world 
 I believe a [x2] 
 Imagine if 
 A heart a heart a heart can save the world
