Nah, come on T, man 
 Not even chatting to these bruddas, man 
 They're boys, man, baby boys 
 Still got Oysters and that 
 Not even oyster for petrols 
 Time's different on their wrists 
 Oh, my god, look at my Roley 
 Look at my squad, like holy moly 
 Oh, my god, look at my Roley 
 Look at my squad 
 Yeah, fuck it, I'm a selfish prick 
 Stacking I go getting rich 
 Rocking YSL and shit 
 You in the ghetto getting nicked 
 Champagne glasses in the whip 
 Moses told me that it's lit 
 I've got makeup on my dick 
 Holy cow, holy shit 
 Wore no collars when we met 
 Make up stories in their heads 
 When this morning, made some eggs 
 For your bae in my bed 
 I have things but not success 
 I got steaks and overheads 
 Closed mouths don't get fed 
 Boy, you tired, go to bed 
 I'm alive and I'm a ledge 
 You're alive, so why you dead? 
 [?] In the flesh 
 Boujee bastard in the flesh 
 Niggas say it with their chest 
 I just say it, then it's pressed 
 'Raris in the SLS 
 Parties in the SLS 
 Oh, my god, look at my Roley 
 Look at my squad, like holy moly 
 Oh, my god, look at my Roley 
 Look at my squad 
 I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm a fucking nervous wreck 
 God, I hate these sycophants 
 Everything that's in my head 
 Sound like Kanye when he raps 
 I don't do this for my 'Gram 
 I don't do this for no bants 
 Why you tweeting me this shit? 
 You ain't fucking relevant 
 Someone tell 'em that I'm woke 
 Someone tell 'em that he's broke 
 Someone tell 'em that the boy done seen a mill at 24 
 In Australia for a show 
 You in Shoreditch doing coke 
 I got a mac by five guys, anyone can get this smoke 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Kings all in my lineage 
 No trace, no witness 
 Pray to God for forgiveness 
 Lambo all tinted 
 The kids all know the plate 
 Chicks go all the way 
 It's one phone call away 
 Oh, my god, look at my Roley 
 Look at my squad, like holy moly 
 Oh, my god, look at my Roley 
 Look at my squad 
 I'm a boss 
 In a Porsche 
 It's very posh 
 Too much sauce 
 Too much sauce 
 And my house is like my exes 
 Too much sauce 
 My Lamborghini 
 It look like Jaws 
 That's not a Roley 
 It's Michael Kors 
 Too much sauce 
 You best run back to your older boy 
 I know young Gs is gon' FaceTime if they wil' out like Soulja Boy
