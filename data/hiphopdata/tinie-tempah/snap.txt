Lets go... (uh) 
 The ones we love 
 The ones we've lost 
 There's some we frame 
 And there's the ones we crop 
 When all my favourite ones were ruined by my ugly dog 
 But mum and daddy's wedding days are the most lovely shot 
 I had a 1000 free minutes till they cut me off 
 Talking to this chick that used to love me (uh) 
 She used to send me lovely pictures of her lovely (uh) 
 Now they are even bigger and they're bustier 
 Ha wow. I used to wonder at the stars a lot 
 Sitting in my dads old barber shop 
 I used to pull faces when he past the mop 
 Then he gave me his plate and glass to wash 
 He made me wanna be the man in charge, the boss. 
 That's how he got his first grey 
 But he laughed it off 
 The moments and memories we keep 
 Will be forever stored in my micro SD 
 Back in the day 
 When I was young 
 Those were the days 
 Wish that I could go back 
 I wanna take you back 
 To the very moment when you take a snap 
 Back in the day 
 To little me 
 Reminiscing all, all the memories that 
 Made me happy and they made me sad 
 All the very moments when you take a snap 
 Second year of college on the fourth day 
 That's when I see you standing in the hallway 
 (Uh) Leonardo da vinci portrait 
 She had a face that I could be looking at all day 
 Dior shades, small waist 
 God put a lot of body in a tall frame 
 I got all fazed 
 She was pure 
 I took up literature just to get to know her more 
 She said she liked immature when she was immature 
 Shy girl, she could of worked on her image more 
 (Uh) she made me laugh till my ribs were sore 
 We were for better for worse 
 We were for rich for poor 
 I was tidying my room 
 When my sister saw 
 And said T why you still got her picture for 
 These moments and memories we keep 
 Will be forever stored in my micro SD 
 Woo. 
 Back in the day 
 When I was young 
 Those were the days 
 Wish that I could go back 
 I wanna take you back 
 To the very moment when you take a snap 
 Back in the day 
 To little me 
 Reminiscing all, all the memories that 
 Made me happy and they made me sad 
 All the very moments when you take a snap
