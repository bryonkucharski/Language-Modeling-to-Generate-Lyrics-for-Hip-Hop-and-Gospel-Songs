They say that some things are too good to be true 
 But I just hope they ain't talking about you 
 I heard that everything must come to an end 
 But I just can't imagine me without you 
 Don't tell me I'm dreamin' 
 'Cause if I've been dreamin' 
 I don't ever want to wake up 
 So in love with this feelin' 
 Tonight I'll be sleepin' 
 Sleepin' with my eyes wide shut 
 Out of sight they say out of mind 
 But your image will remain till the end of time 
 I'm strong but hearts are easy to break 
 Don't want to fall if there ain't no one to catch me 
 Me without you, me without you 
 Oh, I don't ever want to wake up 
 Don't tell me I'm dreamin' 
 'Cause if I've been dreamin' 
 I don't ever want to wake up 
 So in love with this feelin' 
 Tonight I'll be sleepin' 
 Sleepin' with my eyes wide shut
