(Wiz Khalifa - Chorus) 
 I grew tired of the same, then one night 
 Packed my things, told the one I love 
 I'll be back one day 
 Through the fight, through the pain 
 Booked a flight, took a plane 
 Told her not to cry 
 I'll be back one day 
 Been dreaming this since I was young 
 So baby girl I'll be going till I'm gone (gone) 
 Till I'm gone (gone) 
 Till I'm gone (gone) 
 (Tinie Tempah) 
 I buy time in Switzerland 
 I drive round in Monaco 
 I shook hands with Royalty 
 I make songs that monarchs know 
 Ti Ti Ti La So fa? 
 Mi Mi Mi Ra Do? 
 Call me Aloe Blacc 'cause I Need That Dollar yo 
 Ha ha 
 Hic-hic-hiccup 
 Blame it on the liquor 
 I came through like a stick up 
 Now I'm ballin' like a kick up 
 I be cutting off these bitches like an episode of Nip Tuck 
 And yes I am the best man, I'm so sorry 'bout the mix up 
 Come out and play, pour out another bottle 
 Let's do it all today and worry 'bout it all tomorrow 
 I do it for the thrill 
 You know I love the rush 
 And once you get me going I can never get enough 
 (Wiz Khalifa - Chorus) 
 I grew tired of the same, then one night 
 Packed my things, told the one I love 
 I'll be back one day 
 Through the fight, through the pain 
 Booked a flight, took a plane 
 Told her not to cry 
 I'll be back one day 
 Been dreaming this since I was young 
 So baby girl I'll be going till I'm gone (gone) 
 Till I'm gone (gone) 
 Till I'm gone 
 But I won't be gone for too long 
 (Tinie Tempah - verse 2) 
 In Amsterdam and Milan 
 Just came off Aussie tour 
 You've never seen this before? 
 I'm the one like 2 plus 3 
 M-M-M-Minus four 
 Fe-fe-fe-fi-fo-fum 
 Everytime I can stalk 
 Yeah, yeah, I'm honest I landed in a rocket 
 With a crown inside my watch and silver B sign on my bonnet 
 You don't need a thermometer to tell you who's the hottest 
 Ip dip do muthaf-cker you are not it 
 Come out and play, pour out another bottle 
 Let's do it all today and worry 'bout it all tomorrow 
 I do it for the thrill 
 You know I love the rush 
 And once you get me going I can never get enough 
 (Wiz Khalifa - Chorus) 
 (Tinie Tempah - Verse 2) 
 Ok I'm in it, I'm in it to the finish 
 I keep them bottles coming like my card ain't got no limit 
 Got some friends that playing football 
 And some friends that playing cricket 
 And a mistress that is fine like a f-cking parking ticket 
 Haha 
 I said I'm in it, I'm in it till the finish 
 I keep them bottles coming till there ain't nothing in it 
 I'm like Mario on mushrooms 
 I'm like Popeye on some spinach 
 We gon keep it coming till I no speaka no English 
 Ah
