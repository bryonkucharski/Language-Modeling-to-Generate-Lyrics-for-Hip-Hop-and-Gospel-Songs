Simple 
 Honey, I'm a fine boy, no pimples 
 I've done deja-vu and done dimples 
 And fuckin' everybody wants me on their single 
 My mommy 44 years with no wrinkles 
 I got a hundred thousand on me I can sprinkle 
 All year my house covered in tinsel 
 I go pop and I won't stop, simple 
 Yeah 
 So involved in this moment, I can't let go 
 (Tik tok, check my Roley wrist watch 
 Fuck how much a drink cost, we about to take off) 
 It's outrageous and sophisticated it's all in the air... 
 (The big boss, make 'em jump like Kriss Kross 
 Girl you better turn me on 'cause I'm about to switch off) 
 I can't explain it, but you're gonna love this, 
 So crazy outrageous, simply unstoppable 
 I can't explain it, but you're gonna love this, 
 So crazy outrageous, simply unstoppable 
 I think I should remind 'em 
 I'm about to clean up like a Dyson 
 'Cause I just say how it is like Simon 
 I like the taste of alcohol, I got wine gums 
 I don't ever wanna hear another siren 
 Them high-rises can block your horizon 
 Disturbing London is the city that I'm from 
 Where if we like the tune, we make the DJ rewind 'em 
 So involved in this moment, I can't let go 
 (Tik tok, check my Roley wrist watch 
 Fuck how much a drink cost, we about to take off like...) 
 It's outrageous and sophisticated it's all in the air... 
 (The big boss, make 'em jump like Kriss Kross 
 Girl you better turn me on 'cause I'm about to switch off) 
 I can't explain it, but you're gonna love this, 
 So crazy outrageous, simply unstoppable 
 I can't explain it, but you're gonna love this, 
 So crazy outrageous, simply unstoppable 
 Yeah, Yeah, I betta make 'em say Ooh 
 Keeping Travis on my table 
 I said no to like 6 or 7 labels 
 I used to sit next to Rachel in Staples 
 My fans are crazy with stencils and staples 
 I came to cause a bit of chaos and to break rules 
 If it ain't me, it ain't cool 
 Eh baby, bring another bottle to the table 
 Yeah, yeah 
 I can't explain it, but you're gonna love this, 
 So crazy outrageous, simply unstoppable 
 I can't explain it, but you're gonna love this, 
 So crazy outrageous, simply unstoppable
