 Well I'm a lover not a fighter 
 So I kiss that girl and say goodbye now 
 'Cause I came for kicks not for arguments 
 No whoa oh oh 
 'Cause I'm a lover not a fighter 
 Leave a message after the beep 
 (Beep beep beep) 
 Hello? 
 (Tinie Tempah:) 
 Somebody fill in the gaps, somebody fill in the dots 
 I feel like Cruella de Vil the way I be stealing the spot 
 When all the shutters is down, bitch we be still in the shop 
 I shop for clothes when it's closed, that's why I feel like the boss 
 In my vintage eBay watch, that's why I feel like the Hoff 
 Weren't gonna wait for no institute not to gimme a job 
 These critics giving me bollocks, that's why I give 'em my crotch 
 These paps are getting too nosey, that's why I give 'em my snot 
 'Cause I just tripled my cost of living: steak, salmon, lobster, chicken 
 That's made in my Boffi kitchen by Rosa Dacosta women 
 Come from Disturbing London, the city of foster children 
 Grateful what God has given save us from constant sin 
 In the city of God, I'm from the city of God 
 Bitch, I've been up in the Shard, I really been at the top 
 Separate the man from the man dem, find out who's real and who's not 
 Can't take the heat? Then get out the kitchen and gimme the pot 
 You know what?

 Hello? 
 (Tinie Temaph:) 
 I used to sit on the settee eating a tin of spaghetti 
 Now women think that I'm sexy because I been on the telly 
 Car like 007, them alloys spin in Pirellis 
 I'm with a gold digging heffa, I call her Miss Moneypenny 
 Well is it real? Is it fake? Somebody gimme a break 
 I grew up on minimum wage and I grew up in an estate 
 These rappers calling me bruv and they can't even relate 
 Are they even ready and willing do anything that it takes? 
 I saw my teacher from college, she says she thinks that I'm great 
 I'm gonna give her the D 'cause she never gimme an A 
 She's tryna get in my jeans, I'm tryna kick off my Js 
 Take off my D&Gs and give her my DNA, cause 
 All these bitches be loving me, sipping my bubbly 
 Watching Hangover hungover, be the quickest recovery 
 Couple bad grades, I did shit in my study leave 
 And now she wants my name and a kiss on them double Ds 
 And I love it 
 (Labrinth:) 
 I've got too much love to burn babe 
 Ain't got no time to exchange words babe 
 Things to do people to see 
 Yeah I guess we all gotta play the game 
 Well I'm a lover not a fighter 
 So I kiss that girl and say goodbye now 
 'Cause I came for kicks not for arguments 
 No whoa oh oh 'cause I'm a lover not a fighter
