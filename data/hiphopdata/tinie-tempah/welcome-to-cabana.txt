Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our six star 
 The Hotel Cabana, a world full of drama 
 Interior designed by Dolce & Gabbana 
 Hotel Cabana, where you check out 'fore you check in to our beds 
 And I guess you'll write their checks out without checking 
 Double rooms with hammocks in, masquerades and mannequins 
 Discounts for kids now and anyone who hasn't sinned 
 Yea, but beware of the piranhas 
 And surveillance from the cameras while you're wearing your Havanas in 
 Hotel Cabana, where the sleepless kids live 
 Dancing with fire, look what young money did 
 Confetti on their heads, stranger in my beds 
 Cabana 
 Hotel Cabana, where the curious go 
 Jump in the sauna, let the bad habits grow 
 Oh oh dancing on the edge 
 Hope it never ends in Cabana 
 Let me take you on a journey through these eternal corridors 
 Polished floors, no third, no seventh or eleventh floor 
 Founded and built up on a premise of a clever thought 
 Witness an experience of something unforgettable 
 Hotel Cabana, José Hosanna 
 There are cloaks and daggers 
 There are snakes and ladders yeah 
 Lost souls roaming round like night owls 
 So make sure the doors are locked before you turn the lights out
