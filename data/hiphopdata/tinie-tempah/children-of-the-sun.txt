John Martin: 
 Lay down your head 
 You're not alone 
 Anywhere you go, I follow 
 We are the children of the sun 
 That's all you need to know 
 Lay down your head 
 You're not alone 
 Anywhere you go, I follow 
 We are the children of the sun 
 That's all you need to know 
 Tinie Tempah: 
 Bitch I'm a moon walker like Michael, sky walk all over my rivals 
 Both hands on that Bible, I'm next in line for that title 
 When they got had nothing to do, what was I do, who was in the studio with Taio 
 We climbing high, we on the Kilimanjaro, and their panicking 
 They don't really know what's happening 
 Never gotten clothes off a mannequin, we don't want no comparison 
 I overdose on extravagance, we went for gold and got platinum 
 I told my bro to get an ambulance 'cause I caught a cold and went spaz on them 
 How can home be where the heart is, when your shadow even fucking leaves you when you are in darkness 
 Still get stopped by Sergeant Pepper, looking for that Ziggy Stardust 
 After a lifetime of regret, I'm just looking for some answers 
 John Martin: 
 Lay down your head 
 You're not alone 
 Anywhere you go, I follow 
 We are the children of the sun 
 That's all you need to know 
 Lay down your head 
 You're not alone 
 Anywhere you go, I follow 
 We are the children of the sun 
 That's all you need to know 
 Tinie Tempah: 
 I had opportunity in my window, wise words in my kindle 
 Disturbing London, we here to ball, your team stuck in limbo 
 Like Freddie, Bruno and Ringo, I saw the signs and symbols 
 With that top down on my yellow ride, let bitches hate on my bimbo 
 I'm yards away from that milestone, international dial tone 
 Put me through amaro when you Instagram with your iPhone 
 From yellow bricks to them brown stones, I ring bells, I'm household 
 Look at all the rappers we outsold so keep your mouth closed 
 How did I become so jaded, maybe all these insecurities are making me feel naked 
 Feel like Harry did in Vegas, had my privacy invaded 
 That's a liberty a pity, the epitome of what fame is 
 Priest up in my parish, keep on putting me in their prayers 
 Swear I'd never sell my soul, my pride and dignity is too major 
 We rarely ever get those second chances, after a lifetime of regret 
 I'm just looking for some answers 
 John Martin: 
 Lay down your head 
 You're not alone 
 Anywhere you go, I follow 
 We are the children of the sun 
 That's all you need to know 
 Lay down your head 
 You're not alone 
 Anywhere you go, I follow 
 We are the children of the sun 
 That's all you need to know 
 Tinie Tempah: 
 Looking for a light that can outshine the sun 
 I know one day our time will come 
 Bought a camera to capture these cinematic nights 
 Still don't satisfy my appetite for this lavish life 
 Tell me, doctor, am I fit for all these flashing lights? 
 Like Michael said, it doesn't matter if you're black or white 
 We got the colors of the sun to descend above us 
 All we have is each other in case you happen to wonder 
 Let's go 
 John Martin: 
 Lay down your head 
 You're not alone 
 Anywhere you go, I follow 
 We are the children of the sun 
 That's all you need to know 
 Lay down your head 
 You're not alone 
 Anywhere you go, I follow 
 We are the children of the sun 
 That's all you need to know
