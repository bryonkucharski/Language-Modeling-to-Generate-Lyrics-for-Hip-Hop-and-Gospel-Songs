(Spinderella) 
 Antoinette, what's up, girl? 
 How you doin'? 
 (Antoinette) 
 Yo, what's up, Spin, what's up, Pep, what y'all doin'? 
 (Pepa) 
 Chillin', chillin', chillin' 
 (Spinderella) 
 I mean I was all right until this jerk tried to pinch my butt 
 (Pepa) 
 I almost smacked him for it 
 (Antoinette) 
 Word? 
 (Spinderella) 
 Yeah, he bugged out, bugged out 
 (Antoinette) 
 ...See what you sayin' 
 Cause honey, these days some guys, honey, they just never get enough 
 (Spinderella) 
 Sho nuff 
 (Pepa) 
 That's what I'm sayin' 
 1-2, here we go 
 To Washington, D.C.'s (Go! Go!) 
 Slow - tempo 
 Guys, if you're cool, I'll please ya 
 But since I got a big old butt, I'ma tease ya 
 With somethin' def that I bring for 
 You and yours truly, so let me ring your 
 Bell inside this place tonight 
 And my body is yours, fellas, right? 
 Psych 
 (Guy 1) 
 Never get enough 
 (Guy 2) 
 Aw 
 (Guy 1) 
 Of that sweet foxy thing 
 (Guy 2) 
 She is foxy, you know she's she foxy 
 (Guy 1) 
 I want her all the time, youknowmsayin? 
 ...Cause yo 
 I never get enough 
 Of that sweet lovely thing 
 I just got to make her mine 
 Now let's get back to this smooth groove 
 With rhymes cool enough, they'll soothe 
 With looks good enough to quench your 
 Thirst, and if it's not good enough, I'll drench ya 
 (Yeah, go head, girl) (Go, go) 
 But what he wants to - no, no, no 
 I can't let him play me 
 So - ehm, why don't you say we 
 (?Sit us in a cell?) back up off me 
 You ain't the tea, so smell the coffee 
 And if I got a song I'll sing mines 
 If my butt looks tight in my jeans, yo, I swing mines 
 Touch my body, I call your bluff 
 Cause some guys just never get enough 
 (Guy 2) 
 And she called your bluff, money 
 (Guy 1) 
 My bluff? 
 (Guy 2) 
 Mh-hm 
 (Guy 1) 
 Oh man 
 Never get enough 
 Of that sweet foxy thing 
 I just want it all the time 
 Never get enough 
 Of that sweet lovely, lovely thing 
 If I get her, I make her mine 
 Let's go 
 Let's go after her, come on, let's go 
 (Yo, he wants it) Sure, he can have my autograph 
 (He don't want that!) Well, then I think I oughta laugh 
 Cause guys will play like they love you 
 Give 'em an inch and they think they're above you 
 And that's the chance for him to diss me 
 And for a girl like moi, that is risky 
 That's why I gotta come on tough 
 But some guys - they just never get enough! 
 (Guy 1) 
 Never get enough 
 Of that sweet foxy thing 
 (Guy 2) 
 I just gotta make her mine 
 Why can't she see? 
 (Guy 1) 
 I never get enough 
 Of that sweet, sweet foxy thing 
 Once again, here we go 
 To Washington, D.C.'s (Go! Go!) 
 Slow - tempo 
 Guys, if you're cool, I'll please ya 
 But since I got a big old butt, I'ma tease ya 
 With somethin' def that I bring for 
 You and yours truly, so let me ring your 
 Bell inside this place tonight 
 We gonna end it like this -
