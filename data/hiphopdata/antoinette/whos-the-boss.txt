Day time 
 Night time 
 Any time's the right time 
 Who's the boss ofcourse antoinette's rhyme... 
 Now here we go hug your stereo 
 It might pump or jump around 
 Bum rush the sound beat it down run it in the ground 
 The bigger they are the harder they fall oh well they fell 
 Their records couldn't sell even if you gave 'em away free 
 Ah, honey you're just a wanna be 
 Rap star 
 And now you're trying o front on me 
 But kids who play will suffer when the beat is on 
 And the going gets tougher when the heat is on 
 I go off and I be keeping it kept on/make like a rash break out or get stepped on 
 Step child you're just a son in this 
 And antoinette is like running this 
 Yeah dance go ahead do that 
 Instead pick up your head 'cause I flew that 
 Antoinette taking no loss wearing no shorts but telling you who's the boss... 
 If you were brave because you escaped or get hit wit' 
 You little nit wit 
 You better get wit' antoinette on set 'cause I'm fed up 
 I'm going head up/now get up 
 Ducks who get stuck in 
 Grab your cup and I'ma fill it to the brim 
 So take a sip don't bite 
 Your lip don't take bites out or it's gonna be m.c.'s lights out 
 The young the old the bold they all like be looking because I'm hooking but I ain't a hooker 
 So save that for t.j. 
 That he say and she say ain't no threat 
 I'm knocking out gangs with no stress 
 So who's the boss? it ain't a weak chick 
 So let me launch a rhyme and let the beat kick... 
 Lace up so you could face up and hit the line up 
 Play me wrong and yes you might wind up dead on arrival 
 Because this is survival of the fittest 
 So do your push ups and get wit' it 
 Before I go off without that 
 No question about that ('they're closing in') yo-i doubt that 
 Face to face rhyme for rhyme 
 Fist to fist sweet dreams when rings hit lips so 
 Slow down I won't go down in a throw down 
 Yup she's out now that's another hoe down 
 You should be knowing this 
 You can't flow with this 
 The best the gangstress-the def soloist/i roll, the mic transforms like a decep 
 A's in effect so who could possibly efect the chick with soul? 
 The boss who has to master 
 To ducks who front I make like a ghetto and blast ya' 
 I'm hyper riper doper stronger 
 Break beats get broken and rhymes last longer 
 I'll find and lose ya' and left ya' lost 
 And you sweat to death like a horse/now who's the boss...?
