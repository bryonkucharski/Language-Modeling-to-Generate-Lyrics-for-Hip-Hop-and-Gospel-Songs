White man (7x) 
 This record were about to embark on 
 Might offend some other white junkies but... 
 If you are righteous weather you are black yellow or white 
 You will know what I'm about to say is right 
 If you are down with the clan you must understand 
 That where gonna stand up and fight you 
 My brother man. 
 White man 
 Will always get paid 
 White man 
 Black is beautiful, brown is hip 
 Yellows okay but white ain't shit 
 Man I'm not a racist or a fanatic 
 See me on the Ave chillin' with my automatic 
 My name's Schoolly School - I'm in your neighborhood 
 Though my color is brown - I'm up to no good 
 Look at that nigger 
 Wants to pull a trigger 
 To high on caine 
 That's what I figure 
 Come here honey tell you something funny 
 We make the raps and they make the money 
 Keep us uneducated and dumb in the brain 
 The same white bitch got you strung out on caine 
 White man 
 If you ever feel like this 
 Man Fuck school, school is getting sleazier 
 Fuck work, my work is getting measier 
 Fuck life, I'm tired of getting pleasier 
 I rather sell drugs, selling drugs is easier 
 Standin'on the corner selling cadges of crack 
 Telling all these little kids to step the fuck back 
 Sneakers ran over, you hear all nighty 
 Only thing you care about is beat me up scotty 
 Yes slick, I'm giving my dick 
 Don't come here causing some/and? Pain 
 'Cause you's the same white bitch that got me strung out on kane 
 White man 
 Yo babe check this shit out 
 Fuck the TV, the sender is wrong (?) 
 To say cheebah cheebah in a Schoolly D song 
 They think I'm uneducated and some of the brain 
 That same white bich got me strung out on kane
