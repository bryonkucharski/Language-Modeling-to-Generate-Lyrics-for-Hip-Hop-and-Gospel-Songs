Cheeba, cheeba on my brain 
 Went downtown jump the train 
 12.o clock in new york 
 No cab I had to walk 
 Downtown latin quarters 
 Got inside drunk some water 
 Stepped on stage started to talk 
 Said yo yo what up new york 
 Danced all around act so silly 
 Homey in the crowd said must be from philly! 
 Code was cuttin' I was grabbin my dick 
 Thought to my self I'm tired as shit 
 Jump off stage ran outside 
 Grab code money jump a ride 
 Turn left no homey turn right 
 Straight back to the after midnight 
 Got into the place people was cheerin 
 Girls threw panties that they was wearin 
 Fella's in the back they was learin 
 My fat gold chain they was starin' 
 I wasn't carin you faggots 
 I ain't fearin 
 Calm down cool and chill 
 Crack another forty smoke some kill 
 Woke up early Sunday morn 
 Jump out tha bed fila's on 
 Thought about the hangover 
 Kiss the dog called my mom rover 
 Went into the kitchen captain crunch 
 Turn on the tube the brady bunch 
 Instead of a house they lived in a palace 
 Jan was fuckin' mike mike was fuckin' alice 
 My little eyes opened up wide 
 The thing in my pants started to rise 
 Sat down on the couch to cool and chill 
 Crack me a forty roll some kill 
 I was smokin' I was tokin 
 My mom said boy you must be jokin 
 Threw me outside it was rainin I was soakin 
 That weed so damn provokin 
 Yeah! So I crack another forty 
 Smoke some kill thought to my self my mom got I'll 
 Yeah 
 Wait to she get my bill
