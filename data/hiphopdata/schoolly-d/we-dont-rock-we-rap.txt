1,2, 3, 4 We don't rock we rap 
 It's like that 
 You thought it was gone 
 But now I'm back 
 Standin on stage in a hell of a rage 
 Fake rock N rollers put you back in your cave 
 I don't like rock N roll I never did 
 Didn't evne like when I was a little kid 
 You's a longhaired freak 
 Seven days a week 
 Making money in leather 
 I make money in sneaks 
 I don't like rock N roll cause rock is rambling 
 Rather hear rap cause rock is handling 
 Long haired suckaz get out of my face 
 Cause me and Code Money running the place 
 We RAP! 
 We don't rock we rap 
 1,2 3, 4 (4x) 
 You is capastetic 
 You know you can bet it 
 I take you rock N rollers man you never get wet it (?) 
 Code cut the records down to the bone 
 I'm the only MC that rock the microphone 
 For your information, in this nation 
 It's all about that rap creation 
 Another motivation, domination 
 I'll be ill as innovation 
 It's a killer, no it's a thriller 
 Yo Code how about a miller 
 We don't rock we rap
