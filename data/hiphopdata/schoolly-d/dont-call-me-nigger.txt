"As we all know, you just can't believe everything you see and hear, can you? 
 Now if you'll excuse me, I must be on my way.." 
 (Schoolly D) 
 Don't call me nigger... WHITEY! [x2] 
 Don't call me nigger (nigger) WHITEY! [x2] 
 The whitey my man, you say you're my fan 
 I look into your face and I gots to say damn 
 I feel a lot of pain, the money you gain 
 Because I'm black you think it's come out of 'caine 
 I'll put you on a level, same as the devil 
 Stole my bass then you steal all my treble 
 Line to the eye, a bullet to the head 
 For all those lies, motherfucker you said 
 No you can't face this, so you disgrace it 
 I'm Schoolly School boy, and I will lace it 
 Don't call me nigger... WHITEY! [x2] 
 Don't call me nigger (nigger) WHITEY! [x2] 
 Now take that word nigger, and this is what I figure 
 A nigger, is ignorant, shiftless and lazy 
 So what you tryin' to say boy, is that I'm crazy 
 Now I'm not a racist, or a fanatic 
 But what I'm bout to say might cause a little static 
 White America was raised on sanction 
 And to the black man, I'd like to mention 
 When I am Schoolin, on the microphone 
 Yo homes, leave the fuckin' crack alone 
 Don't call me nigger... WHITEY! [x2] 
 Don't call me nigger (nigger) WHITEY! [x2]
