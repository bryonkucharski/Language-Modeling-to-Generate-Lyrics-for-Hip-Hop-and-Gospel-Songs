Code money

 Put your Filas on

 You wear a lotta gold but you're eatin' popcorn 
 Always rappin' never, never, rockin' the beat 
 First name is Schoolly, last name is D 
 My deejay's funky

 Always rappin' never, never rockin' the beat

 Def and mighty, supernatural rappin' 
 Ace boon coon ski never back-stabbin' 
 Don't give a fuck about what you heard 
 First name Schoolly, last name D, word 
 80 Dollar shirt and my 100 dollar sneakers 
 Gemini mixer and some PB speakers 
 Turnin' out parties everywhere that we go 
 And peepin' all the hoes at the end of the show 
 I say one thing, he says another 
 What's that word you be sayin', muthafucka? 
 I guess it's all right, man, I don't care 
 But I might scare your mama out her underwear 
 Fresh, fres 
 100 Dollar Filas on, it got to be fresh 
 Jammin' to a beat just got to be fresh 
 See a fly young lady, she got to be fresh 
 The things I said to her, you know they had to be fresh 
 I said, "Fly lady, now you got a big butt" 
 Thinkin' to myself, I need to bust me a nut 
 Let's go some place and you give me some smut 
 She looked me up and down, I was out of my luck 
 Man, what the fuck there a whole copy breed 
 And then a pimp pulled up in a Caddy Seville 
 Put my hand on my nuts when I started to ill 
 Nigga saw what I was doin' and he started to chill 
 Didn't wanna be pushin' daisies off some hill 
 So all you mothers and you fathers, with due respect 
 I know you have to worry when I got the kids in check 
 Because the shit I'm sayin', dudel, you did it too 
 I pull a microphone, 212122 
 Well, I'm a tell you a story never ever been told 
 About the 52-crew, so bright, so bold five M C's with mic's in their hand 
 Could you rhyme with a hell of a man? 
 Deejay Lynn on the mix guaranteed to put you all in a blizz 
 If you're out there dancin' on the floor in the fix 
 I let you all know I'm not talkin' shit 
 'Cause I'm always rappin' never, never rockin' the beat 
 First name Schoolly, last name is D

 I know you're wearin' gold but you're eatin' popcorn 
 Always rappin' never, never rockin' the beat

 Ha, we gon' do somethin' for ya you know 
 I got my block hair cut, you know, I got my silk shirt 
 And my Filas on I got my tailor-made jewels 
 There's somethin' I gotta say before I go and it go like this 
 You know we rock, we roll, we jam and we mix 
 And all the other M C's get off of our dicks 
 Because we rock, we roll, we jam and we mix 
 And all the other M C's get off of our dicks 
 Because we rock, we roll, we jam and we mix 
 And all the other M C's get off of our dicks 
 It's that Coqui 900, can I have me a sip 
 Yeah, I get real high, start talkin' some shit 
 And if the shit ain't hot, you know that it's it 
 And then I meet a fly lady, you're lookin' real slick 
 And then I take you in the back, I give you a kiss 
 And then I kiss you in the places that I just won't miss 
 Because we rock, we roll, we jam and we mix 
 And all the other M C's get off of our dicks 
 Because we rock, we roll, we jam and we mix 
 And all the other M C's get off of our dicks
