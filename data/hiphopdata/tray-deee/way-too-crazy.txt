(Feat. Jayo Felony, Daz DillingerJayo Felony, Daz Dilling) 
 (Verse One: Tray Deee) 
 I'm from the city of no pity where them gangsta's at 
 Dippin Lacs, flippin sacks, makin' paper stack 
 Ain't no rules it's just who's pushin major weight 
 And just to claim your stake you gots ta gain some rate 
 Checkin' fools for your dues, let 'em see what'cha got 
 Every step is for respect, you either keep it or not 
 On these blocks I done dropped niggas down to size 
 Ain't no question when it's flexin, who been down to ride 
 Till I die, it's just that Eastside mentality 
 That cause tragedy, now who ya think can handle me? 
 I'm at my peak, out on these streets with heat 
 Homicidal techniques and puttin' niggas to sleep 
 I keep busters on point so they don't get lazy 
 Why you think they sayin' Tray Deee's so crazy? 
 (Jayo Felony) He looked up in the mirror, tell 'em what did you see 
 (Daz) A crazy G from the LBC gettin' way too crazy 
 (Chorus: Tray Deee) 
 They say Tray Deee, is a way G 
 Ba-by, and I'm just too crazy 
 They say Tray Deee, is a way G 
 Ba-by, and I'm just too crazy 
 They say Tray Deee, is a way G 
 Ba-by, and I'm just too crazy 
 They say Tray Deee, is a way G 
 And I'm just too crazy 
 (Verse Two: Jayo Felony) 
 How dare you step on my blue suede shoes 
 Nigga your crew boo-boo but you were born to lose 
 See every time I write a rhyme it's like my last fuckin' time 
 Now do niggas wanna sell dope or do niggas wanna drop dime? 
 Bicth let me flip this brick and, get up off my dick 
 All I can get from you is a motherfuckin hit 
 Bitch, ?? ?? for real, fuck a cheap thrill 
 'Cause you givin' up the ass, haven't you heard crack kills 
 Wanna see me gold, hell no see me flow 
 C's walkin' on the moon by 2004 
 Want me to blast but not, 'cause I'll blast your spot 
 They got a AK for your fuckin' pepper spray 
 You sackin down white gal, pow yow all day 
 It's either Beach to the Bay, where the Gz play 
 Motherfuck my enemigos, spray you or you spray me 
 Me and my nigga Tray Deee on the C/sea, we're gettin' way too crazy 
 (Chorus: Tray Deee) 
 They say Felony, is a way G 
 Ba-by, he's way too crazy 
 They say Felony, is a way G 
 Ba-by, he's way too crazy 
 They say Felony, is a way G 
 Ba-by, he's way too crazy 
 They say Felony, is a way G 
 He's way too crazy 
 (Verse Three: Tray Deee, Jayo Felony) 
 Saggin khakis, totin Magnums wit plans for blastin (BUU BUU!) 
 Whoever wanna chance if their hands the fastest 
 Rich and get beat, no retreat, deceit 
 Pullin whole cards hard, niggas playin' for keeps 
 Stay indiscreet, evade them weak niggas that shaky 
 Don't mistake me, I stay pullin off safety 
 A straight G from the heart with mine 
 Down to ride, and I ain't never hard to find 
 Apologise to me, apologise to me 
 'Cause you's about to meet your end, nigga that's on 4 times 10 
 I'ma boy, with a straight jacket and Chucks, what the fuck 
 On mine? Pickin' niggas like chickens who givin' it up 
 I make brothers pull their pants up, never try to sag 
 In presence of a real ridah, that represent the C-rag 
 (From Long Beach to San Diego) 
 (Daz) It's Tray Deee 
 (Jayo Felony) and Jayo 
 (Daz) Actin' a fool and gettin' way too crazy 
 (Chorus: Tray Deee) 
 They say Felony, is a way G 
 Ba-by, he's way too crazy 
 They say Tray Deee, is a way G 
 Ba-by, he's way too crazy 
 They say Felony, is a way G 
 Ba-by, he's way too crazy 
 They say Tray Deee, is a way G 
 Ba-by, he's just too crazy 
 (Outro: Daz Dillinger) 
 Ha ha, yeah 
 (He's way too crazy) 
 Doin' it like that everyday all day, ha ha 
 (He's just too crazy) 
 And y'all just don't understand this where we drop this on y'all 
 (He's way too crazy) 
 And we gon' continue to drop it like this till we die 
 (Is a way G, ba-by, he's way too crazy) 
 Tray Deee and Jayo Felony
