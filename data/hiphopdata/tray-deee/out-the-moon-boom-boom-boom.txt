Ha, ha 
 What is an M.C.? 
 If he can't rap 
 What is a D.J.? 
 If he can't scratch 
 Don't worry about a thing cause my niggas goin' do it all just like that 
 Boom, Boom, Boom... Boom 
 Ah, bend over, bend over 
 Indeed I am 
 Flossy like gangsta shit 
 I got pounds of weed and keys 
 Sittin' on G's 
 Catch a breeze 
 When I ride by high 
 Sittin' on Tonas 
 Tearing up spots 
 And blocks in my hood ain't got no corners 
 'Cause we done chipped 'em all off a proper piece 
 Bustin' rocks and glocks 
 And gettin' ghost from the Police, 
 No peace 
 So, he gets served with no concern 
 To who gets burned and one day they'll learn 
 Not to be fuckin' with the nigga 
 Buckin' with the trigga 
 Nothing you could figga 
 Could help you escape 
 >From this mind state 
 That I create young nigga 
 Yeah! and it's just like that 
 (Snoop) x2 
 L.B.C. out the moon and my speakers go 
 Boom, Boom, Boom... Boom 
 My rearview mirror's vibratin' cause my speakers go 
 Boom, Boom, Boom... Boom 
 (Soopafly) 
 Now I rock 
 Some will talk 
 It don't stop 
 When that funk shit drops 
 To make your shit go pop 
 Now let that beat ride 
 In your 'G ride 
 We gettin' me right 
 Hittin' with that Dogg Pound "see" life 
 Now its I, with that stylish flow 
 So niggas step back or heads get cracked 
 And I won't let back 
 Who coming with that gangsta shit 
 The shit that only gangsta's get gangsta with 
 Now quick to bust your ass like the cop 
 Waiting, debating for my ass to flip flop 
 But I don't flop 
 I just flip the script 
 When I did and set trip 
 Keep the clip close to my hip 
 And don't say shit 
 When I blast 
 I done told your ass 
 Slow the fuck on down 
 Dogg Pound, Motherfucker 
 (Snoop) x2 
 Boom, and you know that 
 D.P.G's out the moon and my speakers go 
 Boom, Boom, Boom... Boom 
 My rearview mirror's vibrating and my speakers go 
 Boom, Boom, Boom... Boom 
 (Hershey Loc?) 
 >From the archives 
 I arise off the Long Beach streets 
 Will be comlete to the do is done to all that competes 
 Don't be alarmed as I swarm through 
 I warned you and your crew see wax 
 So, what's that? 
 A known fact 
 Battle that the habitat our men is deadly 
 You can get diluted 
 Or depends on where your head be 
 Striving for what you're in for 
 And for your info mo' flow 
 Than the tightest nigga flowed in Ninety-four 
 So, stand and deliver 
 Watch nigga's shiver 
 Quiver in they boots 
 As I mob with my troops 
 Through the east 
 Where the phonies get deleted 
 Be seated, and all the G's I know 
 Stay heated 
 (Tray Deee) 
 See I was born to be known as a thug and thief 
 So anyone with beef 
 I gotta slug to sleep 
 Peep, I'm not no nigga 
 Figga' he can come up 
 By getting a job so I mob 
 Not givin' a fuck 
 I'm the drama 
 Mama warned all they kids about 
 I mash up strapped 
 Get my dibs 'n' out 
 Hustler musn't trustin' a gat 
 To keep me fat, seeking victims 
 Pick 'em and then I stick them in track 
 My heat black 
 With the cereal number scratched out 
 Don't wear a glass shield but 
 You'll still be assed out 
 I'm Mr. Tray Deee 
 And since they say "G" as my title 
 My method mainly homicidal 
 (Snoop) x3 
 Boom, Yeah, and you know that 
 2-1 out the moon and my speakers go 
 Boom, Boom, Boom... Boom 
 My rearview mirror vibrating cause my speakers go 
 Boom, Boom, Boom... Boom 
 (Tupac) 
 Ha, ha, ha 
 Could it be 
 My history living G like 
 Enemies that want to see me 
 Would it be like 
 Picture me practicing perfection 
 Now hit the deck 
 Playa haters gettin' chin checked 
 When I hit the set 
 Watch how they fall 
 When I buck 'em all 
 We Outlaw, Westside 
 Playa, touch 'em all 
 I buck them all 
 Then remain ballin' 
 Out the moon 
 With my glock cocked 
 Shot Calling 
 Brothers fall then they crawl 
 And they beg for they life 
 Should have never tried to rush me 
 Your dead here tonight 
 This is Thug Life 
 Go tell them Busta's 
 Up at Bad Boy records 
 That tricks got a big mouth 
 Busta better check it 
 I can see it plain as day 
 This game I play wide open 
 I pull the trigga 
 Dead figga with his eyes open 
 His pride broke 
 And I tried smoking 
 But, bailed out 
 Soon as they left me at the jail house 
 Mobbin' in my... 
 (Snoop) 
 Yeah, and you know that 
 Death Row out the moon and my speakers go 
 Boom, Boom, Boom... Boom 
 Outlaw out the moon and my speakers go 
 Boom, Boom, Boom... Boom 
 My rearview mirrors vibrating and my speakers go 
 D.P.G out the moon and you know that
