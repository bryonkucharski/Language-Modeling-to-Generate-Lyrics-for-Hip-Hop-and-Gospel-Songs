I'll bring the bag of weed 
 You can bring the bottle of wine 
 Call me whenever we can get together 
 And have us a real good time 
 Its still morning 
 I'm still yawning 
 Outside my window 
 Someone's calling 
 Her name was Micky 
 Habits freaky 
 She liked to do me 
 Her and her homeys 
 Did I mention 
 That I'm balling 
 Rollin' on gold ones 
 That's right crawling 
 That's why she's jocking 
 Early this morning 
 I'm feeling under the weather 
 I'll soon be feeling better 
 Don't forget the paper this time 
 (Repeat: x2) 
 (Somebody's calling) 
 I'll bring the bag of weed 
 (Outside my window) 
 You can bring the bottle of wine 
 (Somebody's calling) 
 Call me whenever, we can get together 
 (Outside my window) 
 And have us a real good time 
 Call me whenever, but never ever after 10 
 'Cause I got to be at home with my bitch and my kids 
 I hit the skin flip the twin lips of love apart 
 Get to diggin' in ya ligaments then bust ya heart 
 'Cause from the start, soon as we sparked the bag I brought 
 I seen you chokin' through the smoke noticed your titties was taut 
 You caught, up in the game that I came to spit 
 I cracked the Hennessey and entered DP gangsta shit 
 You want to get with this, or is you in to twist 
 The game up and make me cum just to say you came up 
 And gained what another strike on your rap 
 When you coulda kept your mouth shut and right on the step 
 With the program knowin' damn well you wrong girl 
 'Cause I shook you and took two of your homegirls 
 You played yourselves so I had to leave 
 Baby shoulda just chilled off this bag of weed 
 (Repeat: x2) 
 (Somebody's calling) 
 I'll bring the bag of weed 
 (Outside my window) 
 You can bring the bottle of wine 
 (Somebody's calling) 
 Call me whenever, we can get together 
 (Outside my window) 
 And have us a real good time 
 I can bring the fat ass bag of weed 
 I just now left the spot 
 You can bring the cold ass bottle of wine 
 And make that your first spot 
 (Somebody's calling) 
 I'll bring the bag of weed 
 (Outside my window) 
 You can bring the bottle of wine 
 (Somebody's calling) 
 Call me whenever, we can get together 
 (Outside my window) 
 And have us a real good time
