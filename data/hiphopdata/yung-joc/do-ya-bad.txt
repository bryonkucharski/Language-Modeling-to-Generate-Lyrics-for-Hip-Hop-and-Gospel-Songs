If it's a problem 
 Gon let me know 
 And if it ain't shit 
 Nigga gon let it go 
 But while it's on my mind 
 I need to let you know 
 Them choppas on deck 
 And I ain't afraid to let em' go 
 (4x) 
 Yeah I'll do ya do ya (do ya bad do ya bad) 
 (2x) 
 You on that dumb shit, ain't wit it man 
 That's the main reason murders get committed man 
 It can go down any minute man 
 Whole squad jump out that black on black many man 
 So you betta be quick and on ya toes 
 Where dem choppa bullets stop nobody knows 
 Babies crying niggas dying all ova da place 
 Mamma crying 'cause is blood all ova her face 
 This is not a game this is not a test 
 Swiss cheese ya brain mayne you be laid to rest 
 I'll bust yo head ask questions lata 
 Throw yo duces sianara to you hatas

 I suggest you keep it moving if you wanna keep her 
 You don't want these problems that's a bad idea 
 Machetti have ya ass running like diarrhia

 If I pull dat tube errybody hit da dirt 
 Look dis could be da boy dat if you only keep it coo nigga act like you growin' steady still in middle 
 Schoo nigga you don't really want dis beef bra put in back in the freeza 
 You'll freeze up when I pull the heat then squeeze pull them knees up

 Call dem boys set you up in broad daylight

 If you loose ya bun say I neva found da shit 
 If I owe ya guap pay ya ass wit counterfeit 
 Oh yeah I'll flex ya nigga don't think I can't 
 Have my broad put some suga in ya gas tank 
 Catch a break line slash ya back tire 
 When ya crank ya car ya engine catch fire 
 Now I don't know what you been told 
 But these are brief descriptions 
 Of how this hood goes
