This a nitty beat 
 Here we go again, ghetto ville U.S.A 
 You know I got by the name nitty right 
 I gotta introduce you to another motherfucker 
 Out my squad right 
 Dis nigga go by the name of Jock 
 He resides in College Park, right 
 But for right now what we gotta do for y'all 
 We gotta give y'all a hit 
 Niggaz in my face, damn near er' day 
 Askin' a million questions like, ?Jock, where ya stay?" 
 Tell 'em College Park, where they chop cars 
 Eat 20 grand spend a grand at the bar 
 Jest bought a zone, Jay's on my feet 
 I'm on that patron so get like me 
 69 cutlass wit' the bucket seat 
 Beat in my trunk bought it just for the freaks 
 Catch me in the hood posted at the sto 
 Pistol in my lap on the phone countin' dough 
 If a girl choose let her do her thang 
 Just like her mama and I ain't sayin' the name brain 
 Everybody love me I'm so fly 
 Niggaz throw the deuces every time I ride by 
 I know ya wonder why, I'm so cool 
 Don't ask me just do what cha do 
 Meet me in the trap it's goin' down 
 Meet me in the mall it's goin' down 
 Meet me in the club it's goin' down 
 Any where ya meet me guaranteed to go down 
 Meet me in the trap it's goin' down 
 Meet me in the mall it's goin' down 
 Meet me in the club it's goin' down 
 Any where ya meet me guaranteed to go down 
 Verse numba 2, do the damn thang 
 Keeps on my neck pockets full of Ben Franks 
 When I'm in the mall hoes just pause 
 As I pop a few tags give me that on the wall 
 Time to flip the work make the block bump 
 Boys from the hood call me 'Black Donald Trump' 
 Dope boi magic seven days a week 
 Numba one record long as nitty on the beat 
 Oh, I thank they like me betta yet I know 
 Lights camera action when I walk through the door 
 Niggaz know my crew we certified stars 
 Ready in the front bout 35 cars 
 Bitches in the back, black beamer coups 
 Girls like girls, time to recruit 
 If ya got a problem say it to my face 
 We can knuckle up any time any place 
 Meet me in the trap it's goin' down 
 Meet me in the mall it's goin' down 
 Meet me in the club it's goin' down 
 Any where ya meet me guaranteed to go down 
 Meet me in the trap it's goin' down 
 Meet me in the mall it's goin' down 
 Meet me in the club it's goin' down 
 Any where ya meet me guaranteed to go down 
 Time to set it off let these nigga know 
 Have ya every seen a Chevy wit the butterfly doors? 
 I ride real slow no need to speed 
 Gotta make sure ya see the buckets on my feet 
 Feds on my trail but now thank I don't know 
 I keep my hands clean 'cause I never touch dope 
 Every time I see 'em look 'em in the eye 
 Ask 'em how? I know it's me surprise 
 Put it in the air rep where ya stay 
 Take a step back blow the kush in they face 
 Stuntin' is a habit let 'em see the karats 
 I'ma make it rain nigga I ain't scared to share it 
 Meet me in the trap it's goin' down 
 Meet me in the mall it's goin' down 
 Meet me in the club it's goin' down 
 Any where ya meet me guaranteed to go down 
 Meet me in the trap it's goin' down 
 Meet me in the mall it's goin' down 
 Meet me in the club it's goin' down 
 Any where ya meet me guaranteed to go down 
 Yung Joc, nitty strikes again 
 This a Nitty beat, Playmaker
