 Now showing 
 New Joc City, starring Yung Joc, A-T-L's most wanted 
 In an action packed movie about gunfights 
 Grinding, the ol' trap, and most of all, getting money 
 (Yung Joc) 
 Oh you already know what it is folk 
 Hey folk, y'all niggaz watch out, dope boy's comin' 
 Let me paint a picture, here's the backdrop 
 Niggaz on the block with a sock full of rocks 
 My intuition tells me, here come the cops 
 First nigga run, last nigga get knocked 
 A couple hours later when it's time to get funded 
 Ten percent of food stamps cost you fo' hundred 
 I had to use a alias 'cause I'm a most wanted 
 Now I'm back in the Chevy on the pedal and I'm runnin'

 Now I gotta switch up cause my trap on fire 
 It's hot like the thermostat was set on high 
 I need another spot just to stash those pies 
 I'ma juice the first down hoe that rode by 
 I'ma tell ya like this, watch yourself bruh 
 The first time she get wrong it time to check her 
 Even though she lick me from my balls to my neck up 
 I gotta watch myself cause this could be a set up

 Niggaz pointin choppers at me like Uncle Sam 
 Thankin' to myself "What the fuck, God damn" 
 I sho' hop to God that this nigga chopper jam 
 I'm lookin' at him crazy, I don't know what to tell him 
 He put the chopper to the back of my cerebellum

 But if you touch that bitch the whole house gon' explode
