(Feat. 3LW) 
 3LW: 
 You think you know me but you have no idea 
 Act like you 'bout it 
 Well lemme put this in your ear 
 If you really 'bout it 
 Do like a fus like you don't care 
 If you 'bout it 
 I don't doubt it 
 Show me that you sure 'bout it ('bout it) 
 Yung Joc: 
 I'll get your mind off ties 
 Cause the hustla don't stop 
 If your girl don't chew then my name ain't Joc 
 The money don't flip then the block ain't hot 
 If she don't scream your name then your game just shot 
 I gotta couple reasons you can call me the boss 
 Ill drop a couple stacks and watch your ass get lost 
 Joc the real shit Shorty bes believe that 
 If you ain't ride till die 
 Bring them car keys back 
 Take your foot off the brake 
 Baby gon ride out 
 If them suckas wanna hate Put um in time out 
 I get that cake you'll soon find out 
 If you ever cross me you'll get crossed out 
 3LW: 
 I've seen it before in a rhyme and a roll 
 Come and catch up with me baby don't stop 
 Get to the floor whatchu waiting for 
 'Cause we can ride b straight to the top 
 Way too long and now it's the time to show um all that is not a game 
 'Cause I don't care what I'm lookin' like 
 I just wanna show you that I'm not goin' no where 
 You think you know me but you have no idea 
 Act like you 'bout it 
 Well lemme put this in your ear 
 If you really 'bout it 
 Do like a fus like you don't care 
 If you 'bout it 
 I don't doubt it 
 Show me that you sure 'bout it ('bout it) 
 Yung Joc: 
 Imma get rich and imma die tryin' 
 I ain't 50 Cent but respect my mind 
 Respect my gansgsta respect my shine 
 Put your click in chick if you step outta line 
 I ain't Kanye but I been through the wire 
 Couple more albums before I retire 
 Most of these rappers ain't nothin' but liars 
 How are they The Killers when they sing in the choir? 
 Straight from the bottom and I'm tryin' to get higher 
 Too many strikes, Got too many priors 
 Messin with us like playin' with fire 
 Get your wick split, time to meet your messiah 
 3LW: 
 I've seen it before in a rhyme and a roll 
 Come and catch up with me baby don't stop 
 Get to the floor whatchu waiting for 
 'Cause we can ride b straight to the top 
 Way too long and now it's the time to show um all that is not a game 
 'Cause I don't care what I'm lookin' like 
 I just wanna show you that I'm not goin' no where 
 You think you know me but you have no idea 
 Act like you 'bout it 
 Well lemme put this in your ear 
 If you really 'bout it 
 Do like a fus like you don't care 
 If you 'bout it 
 I don't doubt it 
 Show me that you sure 'bout it ('bout it) 
 Now I been walking up this road tryin' to find which way to go 
 Tryin' to pull my faith 
 Sometimes it seems like I don't know 
 Now I gotta chance to touch? 
 And the answers right in front of me 
 Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! 
 You think you know me but you have no idea 
 Act like you 'bout it 
 Well lemme put this in your ear 
 If you really 'bout it 
 Do like a fus like you don't care 
 If you 'bout it 
 I don't doubt it 
 Show me that you sure 'bout it ('bout it) 
 You think you know me but you have no idea (No Idea!) 
 Act like you 'bout it 
 Well lemme put this in your ear 
 If you really 'bout it 
 Do like a fus like you don't care 
 If you 'bout it 
 I don't doubt it 
 Show me that you sure 'bout it ('bout it)
