(Background) Uhhhhhyeeaaah 
 (Joc's Dad:) Everything that glitters ain't gold baby 
 (Yung Joc:) I hear ya Daddy 
 I'm choppin 24's 
 Blowin' good dro 
 Yeah, I got plenty Hoes 
 Life ain't picture perfect 
 Yeah ya see the ice 
 And I dress nice 
 Make 'em look twice 
 Life ain't picture perfect 
 Yeah I'm blowin' on some good lime 
 Skatin on two 85's 
 Wouldn't believe half the shit that's skatin through a niggas mind 
 745 complimented with leather and wood 
 Chickens on my dick 'cause a nigga fresh and smellin good 
 Jack boys plottin on my stacks on deck 
 Wanna put the Tec to my chest for the ice on my neck 
 Oh yeah it's easy to attain it all 
 Harder to maintain it all 
 If you want a pierfect picture only god can paint it dog 
 Niggas in these videos with multi-platinum projects 
 Can't even get credit cards 
 And they Momma stay in projects 
 How is that? Scracth my head 
 Somethin' don't seem right 
 Ya teeth full of ice 
 So when ya smile I seen lights 
 Seems like I'm hatin' I'm just statin the facts 
 I ain't feelin' to smile in ya face and put a blade in your back 
 Now try not to get caught up on the way shit looks 
 'Cause everything ain't picture perfect, just listen to the hook 
 Yeah I'm off in magic city 
 Trickin them ass and titties 
 Bitches blowin' me kisses makin' me wanna hit it 
 I must admit, got a good chick and she been holdin' me down 
 But I ain't fuckin' around 'cause there is too much shit goin' around 
 Like the rims on my pickup 
 Scared to get my dick sucked 
 Nigga run into the clinic even from a hiccup 
 Pick up the pieces from the fuckin' puzzle 
 I'm affiliated with niggas who murder, rob and hustle 
 Plus you think I'm ballin 'cause I'm poppin' Crys and spendin G's 
 I'm just tryin' to drink away the pain that killed my nigga steve 
 Nigga please, I ain't shit 
 Cookies and cream 
 Feelin' like Marvin it make me wanna holla and scream 
 Now half the shit ya doin' already been done 
 And that's why half my niggas dead, locked up or on the run 
 That dope money ain't sufficient it don't last all ways 
 Niggas trap all night in project hallways 
 All day long niggas front like stars 
 On them big ass rims that most than they cars 
 Spent 300 on a outfit a hundred on some nikes 
 But his baby needs wopes, diapers and pedialite 
 And you prolly' got a cousin, brother or a friend 
 And this song sound like it from begging to end 
 Then again it might be me 
 And I'm tired of the nonsense 
 Can't sleep at night 'cause I got a guilty conscience 
 (Background:) Can't you see? (over and over until it fades out)
