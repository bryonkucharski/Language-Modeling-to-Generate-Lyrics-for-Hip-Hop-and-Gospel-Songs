 Gorilla Zoe 
 We bottle poppin', we-we bottle poppin',(aye) [x3] 
 Say-say you gettin' money, we-we ain't seen nuttin 
 We bottle poppin', we-we bottle poppin' [x3] 
 Say-say you gettin' money, we-we ain't seen nuttin 
 Yung Joc 
 I pull up to the club, jumpin' out of rovers 
 Lookin' like a car show, dat's da way we roll up 
 Dope bois showin love, all da ho's know of us 
 Need extra security, dey know dey can't control us, 
 I see some niggas hatin', I keep dat supersoaker 
 So I V.I.P. my way standin on da sofas 
 Now watch me demonstrate da way a playa post up 
 I don buried cha weight, u know we throw dem toast up 
 Say ya gettin' guap, well shawty we ain't heard 'bout it 
 Finna set-up shop, well we ain't even worried 'bout it 
 Word on da block, oh dey say you servin' pie 
 I think ya need ta stop, I got some killas dat'll get dat work up out 'em 
 I don't got luv fa you busta's, unless you my kinfolk 
 Yeah you smell dat fruity fruit err'time da wind blow 
 I throw away dat chump change, I'm all abot dat bigga dough 
 Joc a real hood nigga, just like Gorilla Zoe 
 Gorilla Zoe 
 When da money start droppin', all da ho's start jockin 
 When dem ho's start jockin, dem bottles start poppin' 
 When dem bottles start poppin', know dat we're not stoppin' 
 Imma keep bringin' bottles, den dem models start flockin 
 Imma throw a stack, she gon' throw it back 
 I pop da rubberband, she gon' pop ha back 
 She know dat I ball, she gon' grind da wall 
 She gon' bust it open, fo me and my dawgs 
 Got boi's in da club comin' fresh from the trap 
 Watch dem boi's cuff they gurls, 'cause dey know we got dem stacks 
 We in da middle of da flo' blowin' cush packs, 
 I got my workers in da bathroom, sellin pill packs 
 Now da party don't stop 'cause dey we got dat guap 
 She gon' make ha booty clap and Imma throw another knot 
 When da money still phat, dey know dat it's a wrap 
 Bottle poppin' ova here, tell dat DJ run it back 
 Yung Joc 
 When my nigga Steve died 
 U know we popped dem bottles 
 Niggas tried to run and hide 
 We went lookin' wit dem choppas 
 Now it's time to take a ride in dat all black Impala 
 If you niggas think I'm lyin' I put dat on my momma 
 And dats why err'time, his birthday come up 
 Imma hit da town, from sun down-ta-sun up 
 Buy a couple rounds, till dey all get drunk up 
 Fo my nigga, I'm a clown 
 Like the numba 1 stunna 
 Yeah we in da club, my niggas on a pill or two 
 Throw dat bitch a dub, tell dat ho' "I'm feeling you" 
 Pour ha some of dis bub, yeah dat's what I'm finna do 
 Den I ask a question, "shorty what'chu in to?" 
 Den she started blushing, told me bring a friend or two 
 A whole lotta rubba's we gon' cut her like a gin-su 
 Flexin bout some money, dat's da shit beginna's do 
 She know I'm gettin' money and she wanna be a winna too
