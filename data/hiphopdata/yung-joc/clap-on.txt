Lay it down, lay it down cocksukaz, 
 All you hatas and bustas best beware, 
 'Cause if you think its about chu comin' out hard, 
 On da outside lookin' in, 
 On top of da world, 
 Space age pimpin', 
 And living legends da motherfuckaz back, 
 Guns cocked, and reloaded 
 Hm, and dey ridin' high. 
 Clap on, clap off, 
 Got dis strap willin' to knock ya trap off 
 Clap on, clap off, 
 Got dis strap willin' to knock ya cap off 
 Big face rubber band gimme dat shit 
 Nigga you don't need it anyway loud mouth bitch nigga, 
 Snitch nigga at da club like he ain't done nothin' 
 Chest poked out cock sucka' you don't run nothin' 
 OK I'm a pull a muthafuckin' o.j.

 Pray you don't ever see it unfold in ya face nigga

 Boy you know what its goin' be 
 My nigga you know what its feelin'; to be death to my enemy 
 Patna your no kin t me tell it to da gelatin 
 Herd chu been spillin' beans birds from da Philippines 
 One serve judge 2 da nigga you feelin' to serve me,

 Naw one phone call bullets comin' through ya 
 Wall play about my mu fuckin' money and da saw 
 My nigas tow throw aways fuk da law tools on deck 
 Wit tech's and da sawed-off shots 2 ya neck

 Bouncin' lossen blood by da ounces momma cryin' up a river when da news announces 
 I'm pimp tight M-J-G plenty ammunition 
 In my coat pocket when I squeeze I'ma get attention 
 You can talk shit just don't put my name in it, 
 Dis is real life and I don't play games in it, 
 I'm a stranger to you so you can't handle me you ain't killin' nothin' 
 But ya homeboy's and ya league you can bump ya guns, 
 All dat bullet talk you say you don't mean shit, 
 Mufucka' dis a new day you can neva play like piano 
 You sloppy I'm jus' slippin' like Giano Versaci

 I get a doctor to kill you, and dump you in some apartments
