Might as well, might as well, might as well 
 Trap stupid (boy you comin' through) 
 Club jumpin' (boy you comin' through)

 Paint the chevy, throw some rims on it too 
 Roll a blunt for me, and roll one for you 
 Fuck with me, you're fuckin' with the whole crew 
 Say whattttt (might, might, might as well) 
 Joc eyeball the purp, I don't need no scale 
 Got a real trap house, and real clientele 
 Buy 72, the biggest motor chevy made 
 Built 7 on the horses, real heavy weight 
 I get head then cake, everyday my birthday 
 Birthday sex with your bitch, fuck her everyway 
 Bought to mount it up, goin' throw them 30's on it 
 Paint stupid wet, boy I put my ladies on it 
 I'm a guap boy, body all mugged up 
 Tryin' to be a hot boy, get your body ___ 
 In high school I brought jewels for show and tell 
 Oh well I'm fly as hell, might as well 
 Trap stupid (boy you comin' through) 
 Club jumpin' (boy you comin' through) 
 My girlfriend say she ain't wanna fuck with you

 Roll a blunt for me, and roll one for you

 Smash that, make you tires scream like a choir 
 Stare at me with butterflys like mariah 
 I bought them all, and all the tires I desire 
 Swag team I started my own empire 
 3 strikes and the judge be the umpire 
 So I do my dirty night like a vampire 
 I aim higher than you could put your lighters 
 I hope you got heat, my whole team fire fighters 
 My sway make your granny wet, make you change her diapers 
 The bitch that you with... pshhh I one night her 
 Rowdy rowdy typer, that boy ring bells 
 Beat that nigger till he swells, might as well 
 Trap stupid (boy you comin' through) 
 Club jumpin' (boy you comin' through) 
 My girlfriend say she ain't wanna fuck with you 
 Say whaaaaaa 
 Paint the chevy, throw some rims on it too 
 Roll a blunt for me, and roll one for you

 My last ten dollars, Ima spend it on the kush 
 Obama, middle fingers up the bush 
 Nothin' in my face, bitch I might mush 
 'Cause of your shades, fresh fade, make 'em look 
 Ima rep my city 
 Crawlin out the chevy, what you sittin' on 
 Oh halle berry I wanna take her home 
 Trap stupid (boy you comin' through) 
 Club jumpin' (boy you comin' through) 
 My girlfriend say she ain't wanna fuck with you 
 Say whaaaaaa 
 Paint the chevy, throw some rims on it too 
 Roll a blunt for me, and roll one for you 
 Fuck with me, you're fuckin' with the whole crew
