 Call me cookie Monsta eat that thang for dinner 
 You gone fuck around and make me pull it out and put it in ya (in ya) 
 Juicy, Juice in them thongs when I bend-a 
 Ova then I cutter like a sword from a ninja 
 I been stroking, I ain't, in the back of the phantom, legs up, doors open- mayne 
 Similar to Chris Brown, I teller to run it (Run it) 
 That arch in her back, now I'm digging in her stomach 
 Like a bill collector, she keep runnin' from it 
 Neighbors hearin Screams so they think the house is haunted 
 (Chorus 1x)- Slim 
 Verse 2- Joc 
 I remember that night, at club ????? 
 I was on Ciroc on the rocks, she was Goosed up 
 Headed out the door, down the street to the Flame 
 Your homegirl was working so we went and threw some change 
 Bout 2 O?clock on the dot we was out 
 You, Me and her bucket naked on my couch 
 All I remember, it was in December, 
 Her name was September, munchin on my timber-mayne 
 Then I went and pinned her down and we was round two?n it 
 And you was in the middle of us two an? now we doin' it 
 Blowin' on my blowpop, Now they both is chewin it 
 By the way they do it I can tell they ain't new to this 
 (Chorus 1x)- Slim 
 (Joc) Ha Ha that's right, we gone end this thing right 
 Aye, Lets Go 
 Verse 3- Joc 
 When I'm on my tippy toes, you know I'm in my zone 
 She want me to beep beep all night long 
 And play wit that pussy, I man up in it 
 I'm juggin in her box, I stand up in it 
 I said I'm playin' wit that pussy, I man up in it 
 I'm juggin in her box, watch me stand up in it 
 (Chorus 1x)- Slim 
 See imam give 'em what they want 
 Why not?
