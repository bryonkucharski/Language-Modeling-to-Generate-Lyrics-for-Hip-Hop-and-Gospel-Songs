Yeah 
 If I ain't busy doing something 
 I'm busy thinkin' of something to do 
 Get some business bout yoself 
 I be so busy gettin' money I ain't got time to talk 
 Be too busy buying cars I ain't got time to walk 
 Be so busy on the low I ain't got time to eat 
 Be so busy on the hustle I ain't got time to sleep 
 I be so busy gettin' quickies ain't got time to lay 
 I be too serious being busy ain't got time to play 
 Be so busy on the grind still find time to shine 
 Be so busy flippin twenty's I ain't got time for dimes (No) 
 Not in this lifetime 
 No way possible 
 I'm too busy breaking down peas lifting boxes and stuff 
 Running from the cops and stuff 
 With them pots and stuff 
 You know just said that shit gettin' gwaup and stuff 
 Man I be busy in the trap 
 I be busy movin packs 
 I be busy handling business I ain't got time for all of that 
 I be busy gettin' stacks 
 I be busy gettin' change 
 *** 
 Ain't time to be playing games 
 Man I busy than a muthafucka 
 I be busy on the block 
 Doing shows getting gwaup 
 Man you know how shawty rock 
 Man I be busy than a mutha 
 Man I be busy doin' my thang 
 Ain't nothing changed but my change 
 You know how we do it man 
 I got insomnia 
 I can't sleep man 
 I'm getting money 
 I'm a busy man 
 Down in Florida 
 Handling business man 
 I'm like Snow White 
 You met me down in Disneyland 
 Fernando down in Orlando

 I be busy all times just weighin them in 
 One ton that's two mil my friend 
 I counted 1.9 weigh it again 
 Man I be busy than a mutha say it again 
 Ay where you at 
 I'm everywhere 
 From city to city 
 I'm getting money ducking snitches 
 I'm so busy
