(Feat. Twista) 
 (Shawnna) 
 Shawnna kick hot shit for bitches that got they baby daddies locked 
 In the pen' gone; fittin to rock 'cause he did wrong 
 Run up on the cops and he hit 'em with the glock with his wig gone 
 Sellin rock on the big phone 
 In the projects niggaz run up on your set with the tech' out 
 Leave you wet with you chest out 
 Killer niggaz realer niggaz have a nigga fill a never realer nigga 
 Drill a nigga fuckin' with a villain never spill a nigga 
 Fuck that! Nigga bust back, we in the 'Llac 
 Me and my bitches all strapped 
 Puffin the sack and we be sippin on 'gnac 
 Fittin to react, and pop a nigga for them stacks (Ooh-Ooh!) 
 Niggaz I'm with they put the fifth to your whole melon 
 Now with the murderers are known felons 
 I gotta pop a nigga drop a nigga rock a nigga shock a nigga 
 Lock a nigga fuck a nigga, cop the floppin nigga 
 Roll for my bitches that be droppin' in the strip clubs 
 Tryin' get 'em a lil' somethin' 
 If you gotta take it off, take it off like a boss for the big ones 
 Then you get you a big gun 
 Motherfuckers from the Chi like to put it yo' eye if it's on bitch 
 Put it straight to yo' dome heads 
 Now you fuckin' with them gangsters, ballers, hoes, hustlers 
 Bangers - niggaz that with them real motherfuckers like whoa! 
 (Chorus 2X: Ludacris) 
 It's real real - on the block I been up for days 
 I gotta keep the steel steel - in case a nigga wanna get in the way 
 So now what's the deal deal? On the street you got nothin' to say 
 So when I see him I'ma get him (WHAT!) drill him (WHAT!) 
 Fill him fill him (WHAT WHAT!) 
 (Twista) 
 Twista kick hot shit for hoes and thugs 
 In ghettoes and clubs that get crunk; for my homies locked down 
 To whoever hurtin' in the hood and ballers with 22's on big trucks 
 To my thugs that call over to they mob 
 And to the hustlers that be servin' hydro and cocaine 
 To my niggaz that ain't hoes; if they have to 
 They will steal a nigga touch a nigga check a nigga cut a nigga 
 Pull the trigger bust a nigga, yellow motherfucker nigga 
 Ready to fill and spill a drink, I'm drunk go and weed it up 
 And I'm talkin' about go like I'm smokin' the bone 
 Full of some shit that damn sho' wouldn't seed it up 
 Got you fillin the hole then go see your body 
 Probably reanimated with all my Legit Ballaz rollin' up 
 Up the streets stuffed the beats 
 So you see them Navigators, Escalades, Benzes, 
 Beamers, Excursions - bumpin systems TV's and them 20's spinnin 
 Mob for them niggaz that done up off them hard times 
 K-Town, West side, South side 
 Murder us for the money that's why I'm known to kick a hard rhyme 
 Whatever set you represent throw it up 
 If you buck or crunk then take yo' motherfuckin shirt off 
 Dealers get your work off; you wanna party 
 Full of hustle niggaz killer niggaz gangsta niggaz chill niggaz 
 Baller niggaz thug niggaz player haters real niggaz 
 (Shawnna) 
 I'ma kick hot shit for bitches up in the industry tryin' to compete me 
 I'm from the hood South side, West side 
 Where niggaz'll put a motherfuckin slug in my enemy 
 Motown, Pucketown, do or die 
 The difference between a motherfuckin thug and a gangsta 
 One's thug in a chamber 
 Get a nigga stick a nigga put him in a ditch and then forget a nigga 
 Hit a nigga puck a nigga little with the rocker nigga 
 Puff that say you love that 
 We in the 'Llac and put the lemon in the 'gnac 
 Remy and sacks that got me scummy in the back 
 Puffin the raps that got me layin out slacks 
 And it's speakin' like, "Wow, that, blunt let me hit the weed" 
 'Cause I been feelin' like 
 Fuck a nigga bust a nigga Shawnna never love a nigga 
 Chi about to show the motherfuckers how to rush a nigga 
 Crush that put it on momma 
 On everything I got e'rything for the drama, puff marijuana 
 To the Shawnna and put it on ya 
 Flows who you froze in a comma 
 We so relentless, you know Chi up in the business 
 Flows in yo' dome in an instance 
 Hoes and them folks and the Mo's and the ki's and the fo's 
 And the BD's and lows and the fiends and the hoes and God! 
 (Chorus - repeat 2X)
