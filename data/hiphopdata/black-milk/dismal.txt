Hold up 
 How you go from bein' on to havin' no riches? 
 Hoes all in your phone to havin' no bitches 
 Used to be highroller, now look how you sittin' 
 Thinkin' that your life is over, out here tryin' to make a living 
 Told my conscience "Shut the fuck up!", tryin' to get it together 
 Put my hands on my face, can't look myself in the mirror 
 I swore to God, I said I'd never go back bein' broke 
 Feelin' like I'm back at square one, fuck a nigga bein' po' 
 Guess he didn't answer your prayers or help your affairs 
 Now that no one cares, what's the point of bein' here? 
 Yeah yeah, you had it all, hit a broad all night 
 Now shit is comin' full circle, didn't play your cards right 
 Trip 
 A'yo, a'yo, hey, uh, right there 
 Lay low, a'yo, uh, right there 
 There they go 
 A'yo, lay low, right there 
 A'yo, hey, a'yo, right there 
 Lay low, a'yo, hey, right there 
 Right right 
 Now you askin' "Was it worth it?", since your fame did surface 
 Now you see your purpose, didn't turn out picture-perfect 
 Thousand-dollar purchase, guap all in your pockets 
 Used to be on top but now they sayin' you ain't got it 
 So a'ight then, watch me get it even if they goin' to knock it 
 Dollar out of fifteen cents, I turn my shit into a profit 
 Put myself in a hole, money, it got me stressin' 
 Frontin' to force a smile while tryin' to battle depression 
 Nigga, you lost your grip up, nigga, you 'bout to slip up 
 Grab that bottle of liquor, "Porka-Porka", then sip up 
 Hopin' the story ends, hope a new one begins 
 Leavin' from where I been, wake up out the sleep I'm in 
 Huh 
 Trip 
 A'yo, a'yo, hey, uh, right there 
 Lay low, a'yo, uh, right there 
 There they go 
 A'yo, lay low, right there 
 A'yo, hey, a'yo, right there 
 Lay low, a'yo, hey, right there 
 Right right 
 For my niggas, and my bitches 
 On they hustle, tryin' to get it 
 When you think you know big dough, then what is it for? 
 Yeah they talkin' mash, woah, what I'm in it for? 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 They on that, we on that 
 Right now
