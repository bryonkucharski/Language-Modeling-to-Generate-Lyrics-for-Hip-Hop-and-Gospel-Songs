Was I too loud to hear you screaming 
 Was I a fool to dream it once again 
 Was I to calm to feel 
 To steal 
 Some ordinary whispers 
 Calling out your name 
 Did I foresee the lies I've forgotten 
 Did I expect scars upon your face 
 I couldn't tame my mind 
 And blame 
 The rhymes that fell to pieces 
 Broken on your trace 
 But maybe I was meant to hear your promise 
 And get through it all again 
 And all the lines will mend 
 And lead the hopeless 
 If the gods may know your name 
 Can't you believe in the voice I followed 
 Can't you forgive the choices I have made 
 And if I need you now 
 Somehow 
 It's funny I'm still fighting 
 Though it's far too late 
 But maybe I was meant to hear your promise 
 And get through it all again 
 And all the lines will mend 
 And lead the hopeless 
 If the gods may know your name 
 If the gods may know your name 
 And I tear everything apart 
 But there's nothing to expect 
 From a bleeding heart 
 From a bleeding heart 
 But maybe I was meant to hear your promise 
 And get through it all again 
 And all the lines will mend 
 And lead the hopeless 
 If the gods may know your name 
 And maybe I was meant to hear your promise 
 And get through it all again 
 And all the lines will mend 
 And lead the hopeless 
 If the gods may know your name 
 If the gods may know your name 
 If the gods may know your name 
 If the gods may know your name 
 If the gods may know your name 
 If the gods may know your name 
 If the gods may know your name 
 If the gods may know your name 
 If the gods may know your name
