Haven't told a soul 
 But they seem to know 
 Didn't say a word 
 But I've been overheard 
 I guess it's obvious 
 How I feel about us 
 They say that I'm a hopeless case 
 It's written right there all over my face 
 It's no secret, no matter what I do 
 I can't help but feel it 
 There's no use in playing it cool 
 It's no secret, gotta let you know 
 'Cause I really feel it 
 Baby, I'm in love with you 
 When you talk so sweet 
 I get a little bit weak 
 When I see that smile 
 My heart goes wild 
 When we finally touch 
 Ah, ah and then a voice inside me screams 
 Don't be shy 
 It's no secret, no matter what I do 
 I can't help but feel it 
 There's no use in playing it cool 
 It's no secret, gotta let you know 
 'Cause I really feel it 
 Baby, I'm in love with you 
 I picture us together, in a world that's just for two 
 It's my vision of forever, can you see it too? 
 What do I have to do for you to understand? 
 Gotta get through to you baby if I can
