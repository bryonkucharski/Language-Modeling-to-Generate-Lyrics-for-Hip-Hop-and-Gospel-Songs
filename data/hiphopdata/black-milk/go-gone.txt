Let's change it up man... let's do some soul shit 
 It's like Cadillac grills, black shit kills 
 Matter fact, niggas wit backpacks feel this 
 Even though I'ma still talk about grills and millions nigga 
 Fine bitches come, fine bitches go 
 All they want is a piece of the bank roll 
 Diamonds from they neck to they ankles 
 But I tell hoes 
 Oh my, this nigga flows retarded 
 Y'all niggas trash, y'all niggas ain't artists 
 "Sanford and Son", all I see is garbage 
 When I see y'all niggas 
 Is that that ice? Niggas get icey 
 Check that price tag, shit looks pricey 
 Shouldn't blow all my dough on the ice see 
 But it goes good with my white tee and my Ice Cream's 
 Might seem that my shit bangs mo' 
 It's hot, spit with the octane flow 
 Time is money and time ain't slow 
 Gotta go hold some of that Lebron James gold 
 Ya got niggas out here, and they so gone 
 Ladies out here, and they so gone 
 Listen to the song, feel free to sing along, everybody (x2) 
 I'm sayin' make this money, take this money 
 Delt with if you try ta take it from me 
 Left Timb bloody, ain't no runnin' 
 Ain't no money, ski mask comin' 
 Hardcore with it, yeah Black did it 
 If G once did, then Black'll hit it 
 Now Black giving, off ta my man's and them 
 Y'all done wit her, send her off then 
 Plus mad dough is a must and 
 Your girl was lusting, for me 
 Her double D cups and 
 Show when her nips is bulging 
 And I know for sho' it's not that cold in here 
 Know this, I gotta show kids, my flows ferocious 
 Make sure you know this shit 
 Go together like afros and picks 
 New song, sing along with it
