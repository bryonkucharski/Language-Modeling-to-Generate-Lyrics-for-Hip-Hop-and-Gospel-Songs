So I say what up to the world, still rockin' in advance 
 Black Milk, people's choice, most popular demand, I 
 Man, I have everyone like damn 
 Goddamn, that nigga Black back once again 
 Not fair how simply will he just 
 Stick to the beats and the MPN?, ock 
 No idea not, I'ma just kill it and 
 Plus times money and I'm counting every minute 
 Producer rappers get the most criticism 
 Until they heard Black now they gonna feel different 
 Took it back made 'em change they decision 
 Bout ock non-stop, hip-hop's Jimi Hendrix 
 I'm underground but don't get it twisted man 
 I'm in the range and I'm thinking bout tha Escalade 
 We like a little platinum on the chain, on the ring 
 I'm from the city of the gators dog, what'chu think 
 'Cause I don't walk with no backpack on 
 Don't put me in a box dog we do it all 
 You can catch me in the club from the window to the wall 
 Till the sweat drops down, watchin' strippers take it off 
 We can spend a little money doesn't matter what the cost like 
 Cost like, little ice give me little frostbite 
 Yeah I like the dark type, but my favorite color when 
 It comes to the whips is the Caucasian off-white 
 It's time to blow and it's time to do damage 
 And make it hard for niggas to get on like a hammock 
 'Cause I ain't here and gone like I'm hammer 
 You hand me hundreds of grands, I hand you an album 
 And then we break bread, shake hands right over the contract and 
 We eat with our hands so hand me a couple napkins 
 And when I'm done I'm going back for seconds for the cabbage 
 'Cause my niggas hungry as hell, we always feelin' famished 
 And when I say the cabbage, you know I mean the money 
 And when I say the rap game, you know I mean the buffet 
 Hey, call ya waiter, tell him, "give me a to-go plate" 
 It's Popular Demand, then done gave me the okay
