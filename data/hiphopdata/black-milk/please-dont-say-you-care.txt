Got a vicar with a dice to see the world is not my size 
 To breed a creed that keeps my mind from off this world for sure 
 There's a traitor without fear screamin' truths into my ear 
 Yes I've surely got your point; 
 Please stay away anyhow 
 Please don't say you care, please don't say you dare 
 Please don't say you understand what I demand 
 When all you see is nothing but your gain 
 So don't try to make me believe you care 
 Got a devil deep inside - take my hand when worlds collide 
 To lead aside from all the views that penetrate my mind 
 Far to sell my inner soul - earn some money, gain control 
 But lately I have come to hear me talkin' to myself 
 Please don't say you care, please don't say you dare 
 Please don't say you understand what I demand 
 When all you see is nothing but your gain 
 So don't try to make me believe you care 
 There must be something else - far away 
 There must be more to this - somewhere in my dreams 
 Is it hiding in my sleep? 
 Am I made to never know? 
 Where to go 
 Please don't say you care, please don't say you dare 
 Please don't say you understand what I demand 
 When all you see is nothing but your gain 
 So don't try to make me believe you care 
 Don't try to make me believe you care 
 Don't try to make me believe you care
