Used to be sorry trying to pack a bag of ramen open 
 Now I gotcha bitch chokin' on this dick long strokin' 
 Everyday; bone smokin' 
 Champagne; glass toastin' 
 Suckin' on this sex pistol 'bout to blow her brains open 
 Used to fuck with rat bitches 
 Now I fuck with bad bitches 
 Fuckin' since middle school 
 And dog you never had bitches 
 Dog I came from rag to riches 
 Now I got your bitch permission 
 Squirtin' on her lips and when you home you gon' kiss her 
 Take a nigga head off 
 Like a hot mascot 
 Tell me why your breath be smellin' 
 Like a burnin' bag of fag cock 
 Blowin' on some apricot 
 Crib like Camelot 
 Thinking of the days when I was countin' up my sack of rock 
 Leave ya with a scar face 
 'Cause you niggas rap a lot 
 Nigga you a? 
 Homie I'm a long grenade 
 Found them yellow diamonds have a nigga leakin' lemonade 
 Nigga you bitch man 
 'Bout to need first aid 
 Dog I'm on the grind 
 Like an old stripper 
 In a room full of virgin nerds and fat niggas 
 Now we pack swishers 
 Drink straight liquor 
 Make ya bitch go down low and lick your sister 
 Ghetto ass nigga got dressed on suburban 
 Rap niggas gettin' jerked 
 Ain't no Jergens 
 Fuck so bad in they ass fit Excursions 
 Detroit niggas got it wrapped like turbans
