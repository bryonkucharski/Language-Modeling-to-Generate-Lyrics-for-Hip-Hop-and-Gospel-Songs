In the abbey of disguise, try to look into your eyes 
 But you turn away from me 'cause I'm so ordinary 
 Who am I to miss the point of my self-deceptioned lies 
 Self despair, how can I dare to dream on? 
 If it's true that it makes no difference, under any circumstance, 
 I'm wrong 'cause I'm still tryin' to interfere with what I've got 
 Does it makes no difference ? far beyond my common sense, 
 How come that I'm so determined if it makes no 
 Difference 
 See my microcosm turn, against me once again 
 Smash the frame, can't stay the same in this confrontational ride 
 Who am I to miss the point of my self-deceptioned lies 
 Self despair, how can I dare to dream on? 
 If it's true that it makes no difference, under any circumstance, 
 I'm wrong 'cause I'm still tryin' to interfere with what I've got 
 Does it makes no difference ? far beyond my common sense, 
 How come that I'm so determined if it makes no 
 Difference 
 If only I knew what is comin' my way 
 I could consider a change right away 
 If it's true that it's no difference, under any circumstance 
 And when I'm wrong, I'm wrong 
 If it's true that it makes no difference far beyond my common sense 
 When I'm wrong, I'm wrong 
 If it's true that it makes no difference, under any circumstance, 
 I'm wrong 'cause I'm still tryin' to interfere with what I've got 
 Does it makes no difference ? far beyond my common sense, 
 How come that I'm so determined if it makes no 
 So determined if it makes no 
 So determined if it makes no 
 Difference
