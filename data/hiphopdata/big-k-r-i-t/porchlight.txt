Yeah 
 Baby leave the porchlight on 
 Baby leave the porchlight on 
 Baby leave the porchlight on 
 I can feel your pain through the phone 
 I promise not to stay too long 
 So leave the porchlight on 
 I gotta get it while the gettin' good, get outside the hood 
 I'm tired of the landlord tripping on us 
 My partner said he gotta play, heard it worked the other day 
 I've been home late because I'm bendin' corners 
 Don't worry, hit me via text, ain't no need to stress 
 Gotta make some moves, I hate to leave you home lonely 
 I know just how it be when you in between the sheets 
 While I'm in the streets thinking need to be at home 
 Doing those I got you on the grind nigga 
 When I'm on the shine ain't no telling when I'm coming home 
 Remember that you said that pussy mine 
 In that time you'd meet at the door with no panties on 
 And don't be mad, playing hard to get 
 Cause you could cum till your heart content 
 Yeah, I can feel your pain through the phone 
 I promise not to stay too long so leave the porchlight on 
 I'm coming home, baby it won't be long 
 I know you lookin' fine, slide up behind ya 
 Say something good to you (something good to you) 
 It won't be long (baby leave the porchlight on) 
 I'm coming home, coming home nice and strong 
 I wanna see them eyes when I surprise ya 
 I promise I won't stay too long so leave the porchlight on 
 Back out on the road again 
 Different city, in the studio, working on the flow again 
 I really wanna talk on the phone 
 Shorty I gotta finish this song, it won't be long 
 Until we presidential suite, vaca'ing on the beach 
 Waikikiing for a week 
 Diamond in the back, leather on the seats 
 Louie on your frame, red bottoms on your feet 
 I mean the money can't change how you feel right now 
 Even harder cause you bother once the sun goes down 
 Wonder where I'm going after shows and such 
 Don't be listening to your friends 'cause they talk too much 
 Think I know just what we goin' through, to make it right 
 I pray you understand this ain't over night 
 I'll be on the next flight on my way back home 
 I promise I won't stay too long so leave the porchlight on 
 I'm coming home, baby it won't be long 
 I know you lookin' fine, slide up behind ya 
 Say something good to you (something good to you) 
 It won't be long (baby leave the porchlight on) 
 I'm coming home, coming home nice and strong 
 I wanna see them eyes when I surprise ya 
 I promise I won't stay too long so leave the porchlight on 
 I won't take too long baby 
 I'm on my way baby (baby leave the porchlight on) 
 Comin' home 
 I wanna love you girl (baby leave the porchlight on) 
 You know I'm on my way (baby leave the porchlight on) 
 I can't stay away too long 
 I'm coming home, baby it won't be long 
 I know you lookin' fine, slide up behind ya 
 Say something good to you (something good to you) 
 It won't be long (baby leave the porchlight on) 
 I'm coming home, coming home nice and strong 
 I wanna see them eyes when I surprise ya 
 I promise I won't stay too long so leave the porchlight on 
 I won't wait too long baby 
 Why don't you go on and flip that light on? 
 I wanna see me steppin' up to the door when I'm gettin' closer, closer baby yeah
