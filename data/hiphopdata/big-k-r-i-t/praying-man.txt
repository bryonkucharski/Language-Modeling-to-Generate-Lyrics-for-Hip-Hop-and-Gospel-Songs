Guess I was on the road 
 Didn't know which way to go 
 I think I hear a praying man coming 
 A praying man coming 
 Sometimes I couldn't read the signs 
 My people done left me behind 
 I think I hear a praying man coming 
 I think I hear a praying man coming 
 Stumble along the path, he emerged from the grass 
 Stopped at me and asked why so sad 
 Perhaps because they had taken what I had 
 I'm sure it wasn't much to them but it was all that I could grab 
 I was on my way to church, I was running late at first 
 But after all this riff raff here, I missed service and it hurts 
 But what's worse I'm not sure how long I've been swaying in the breeze 
 Tired of talking to the trees and you the first praying man that I've seen 
 I lending hand, but I see if you got some time 
 I'm glad you looked up because most people pay no mind 
 He smiled and said "Son well, I can do you one better" 
 He removed a pocket knife and cut me down from my oppressor, forever 
 Guess I was on the road 
 Didn't know which way to go 
 I think I hear a praying man coming 
 A praying man coming 
 Sometimes I couldn't read the signs 
 My people done left me behind 
 I think I hear a praying man coming 
 I think I hear a praying man coming 
 Boating along the sea, he emerged from the mist 
 Asked me how I got far from the beach 
 'Cause they stripped me of my pride and put these shackles on my feet 
 I was stacked on top of my folk and it was really hard to breathe 
 It was a little hard to believe that I had been caught up in this mess 
 And some of my own people would sell me to my death 
 It was a lot of us on the ride and it was a lot of us that was lost 
 But some of us couldn't take it so some of us jumped off 
 And I'm really glad you found me on your course 
 I been out here for a while and there's no sign of the shore 
 He smiled and said "Son well I can do you one better" 
 He lended me his hand and picked me up from my oppressor, forever 
 Guess I was on the road 
 Didn't know which way to go 
 I think I hear a praying man coming 
 A praying man coming 
 Sometimes I couldn't read the signs 
 My people done left me behind 
 I think I hear a praying man coming 
 I think I hear a praying man coming 
 Driving along the road 
 He asked me what I was running from and where I was trying to go 
 "Well I was working in the field and one of my kinfolk just got killed 
 And I knew they'd come for me and Lord knows I wanna live 
 See I heard there's people free, not that far but far from me 
 To be running from these dogs with no shoes up on my feet 
 I heard of this railroad that ventures underground 
 And takes my kind of people to a place that we can't be found 
 And I been wounded for some miles, so I decided to rest my head 
 I guess they let me go 'cause they assumed that I was dead 
 Smiled and said "Son hop in this wagon and get settled" 
 He offered me a ride and drove me far away from my oppressor, forever 
 Guess I was on the road 
 Didn't know which way to go 
 I think I hear a praying man coming 
 A praying man coming 
 Sometimes I couldn't read the signs 
 My people done left me behind 
 I think I hear a praying man coming 
 I think I hear a praying man coming
