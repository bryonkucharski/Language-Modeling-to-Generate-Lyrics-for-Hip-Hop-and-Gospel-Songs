Do not be alarmed. You have activated a pre-recording 
 This is LFU300MA 
 To hear clearly, adjust volume to maximum velocity 
 Thank you and enjoy 
 Back one more 'gain for all them players 
 Natural women and mind frame elevators 
 Ten toes down with this experimental south sound 
 Dope up the lines enough to go around 
 And around and around this world thrice over 
 Ain't nothing new under the sun back in '05, I tried to told ya 
 We here 4Eva in a day, can't go back with this one way 
 Take you to where the grass is much greener 
 Putting in work for my redeemer 
 Yea that's the most high 
 I ain't talking 'bout blunts rolled 
 But like saved souls and warm welcomes at front doors 
 Don't let your problems weigh you down 
 Don't let them burdens slow yo pace 
 The quickest way from A to Z is straight 
 On that narrow path, a road less traveled 
 So free yo mind and be one with time 'cause that's all that matters 
 Not all that riff raff or random chit chatter 
 Haters scatters like jacks do 
 Don't drop the ball unless you can pick up 
 All the weight that a winner has to 
 Don't let the struggle outlast you 
 Even if society outcasts you 
 Stand strong in your belief 
 The mountain top ain't hard to see 
 When you let God and let be 
 Live From the Underground
