A mother lost her child, I tried to ease her pain 
 It's only God's will, she said she felt the same. 
 It's funny how the sun will up and battle rain 
 As if the clouds couldn't stand to see me outside a-gain 
 Wrote a rhyme that was kind, with some vision to it 
 Bottom line, it might expand yo mind if you listen to it 
 Too much shine can dull the soul 
 If you feel how I feel then I rap some mo' 
 How can the Devil take my brother if he's close to me 
 When he was everything I wasn't but I hoped to be 
 I get a little honest, and I ask my self 
 If the time come will you save me if I ask for help 
 Send my mind on a journey to the outermost 
 To document what it had seen, and Cc: me the notes 
 And ask Kurt Cobain why, 'cause I need to know 
 He stopped when he had such a long way to go 
 I saw love in the eyes of a perfect stranga 
 She overlooked my caring heart in search of a gangsta 
 Will we ever be together? Only time will tell 
 She called my phone and talk to me as her eye was swelled 
 I put my problems in box beside my tightest rhymes 
 On a lock and key, buried deep of in my mind 
 And when it gets too full, and I can't close the lid 
 I spaz on my family and my closest friends 
 Trade my materials for a peace of mind 
 I'm so close to Heaven, Hell I need some time 
 Who cares about life, and the highs and lows 
 Maybe I should write another song about pimps and hoes 
 Cars and clothes, Idol Gods, Golden Cabs, Louie Scarfs 
 I do this for the love, and it's free of charge 
 I don't need jail to be behind bars 
 This is purely art, in my Grandma's household this was surely taught 
 Don't be naive, yeah these time's is hard. In the mist of all the glamor, hope you find god 
 I never wished to be the burden bearer 
 But souls need saving and it's now or never 
 Shock value is all they wanna see 
 It's us against them, and it's just you and me 
 Tryna take heat what I say in my songs 
 Forgive me if I ever ever stilled you wrong 
 Most people stop for signs, but I've driven through it 
 If it don't touch my soul, then I can't listen to it 
 The radio don't play the shit I used to love 
 Or maybe I'm just growing up 
 I never seen a star on a red rug 
 If I wanna see a stars I just look above 
 To the Heavens 
 I know you been down so long, So I'll be stronger for you 
 I know you been down so long, 'Cause I've been down too 
 Yes I understand, What you're goin' through 
 Yes I understand, 'Cause I'm goin' through it too 
 I pray you find your way, and all things old become new 
 I pray you find your way for my sake, 'cause I'm lost too 
 Yes I Understand, What you're goin' through 
 Yes I understand, 'Cause I'm goin' through it too 
 I lost my friend this mornin', woke up screamin her name 
 She meant so much to me, I'm scared I won't be the same 
 Hope you understand, what I'm goin' through 
 Hope you understand, when I call out for you 
 To vent.
