This for all my country folk 
 Slamming them Caddy doors 
 Sitting out on the porch 
 Fresh from head to toe 
 This for all my Southern kin 
 Be proud of who you is 
 No matter where and when 
 Let 'em know the game you're in 
 This for all my country folk 
 Back on my grind again, wasting no time again 
 Putting it on the line, been losing I'm tryna win 
 Whenever, right now is the better 
 Hoping all those stars and planets align together 
 Tryna weather the storm, go beyond and gone 
 Find all of life's treasures, bringing 'em to my home 
 Like, like we made it Sippi-land, country and all of that 
 Tell all them haters congratulate us or fall back 
 'Cause I'm in my old school, traveling to the A 
 Don't worry, little baby brother, I'll be back like any day 
 Spread the word, I flip verbs like birds 
 Get flipped by dope boys that park rims on the curb 
 Got my CD in they deck, bop they heads, break they neck 
 Whispering that I got next to execs 
 That never heard of Mississippi lyricists 
 Not even visionaries envision this 
 This for all my country folk 
 Slamming them Caddy doors 
 Sitting out on the porch 
 Fresh from head to toe 
 This for all my Southern kin 
 Be proud of who you is 
 No matter where and when 
 Let 'em know the game you're in 
 This for all my country folk 
 Leave it behind, the, the, the crime 
 Fighting for every yard across the poverty line 
 Any given Sunday could be my last 
 Pay my tithes with the gas money or let the plate pass 
 Cause God can understand the lows 
 The feeling of being stranded on the side of the road 
 Watching all the fancy cars come and go 
 Like it couldn't get no worse, but it storms some more 
 Cause whenever it rains, little buddy, it pours 
 When you need the sunshine like the most 
 But even a magnolia fights to grow 
 Under certain circumstances similar to yours 
 I just wanna be heavenly, I suppose 
 Cause success never ever save your soul 
 I came from the bottom of the map to show 
 The world that it's more to us country folk 
 This for all my country folk 
 Slamming them Caddy doors 
 Sitting out on the porch 
 Fresh from head to toe 
 This for all my Southern kin 
 Be proud of who you is 
 No matter where and when 
 Let 'em know the game you're in 
 This for all my country folk
