Annotate (Wake up, Wake up 
 Wake up, Wake up) 
 Thank God for the day, thank God for the morning 
 Won't take this here for granted no good Lord I gots to get on it 
 With every breath I take, or move I make, I gots to keep wanting 
 A better life for me, and all of mine, no time for that yawning 
 In the bed waiting, procrastinating, I gots to be hungry 
 Too old for games that don't mean a thing, can't play with my homies 
 Just know I'm paying dues if I don't pick up for ya, whenever you phone me 
 Cause being broke ain't fun and that pity party I threw is starting to get boring 
 Good morning 
 I know today gonna be the best day of my life, my life 
 (Wake up, wake up) 
 I know today gonna be the best day of my life 
 (Wake up, wake up) 
 Gotta keep my head out the clouds and my feet on the ground 
 Gotta be realistic, stop talking and listen 
 Cause at the blink of an eye your life'll pass you by, good Lord you missed it 
 Now, you're wishing that you went slow, took advantage of that 2-4 
 Yeah you gave your all to get your back from off the wall but you can give more 
 Stand tall against the grain, be yourself don't do the same 
 As the next man cause all paths are different, so don't jump the train 
 Hell, we can't complain, for this borrowed time 
 So don't misuse yours, cause you can't borrow mine 
 Good morning 
 I know today gonna be the best day of my life, my life 
 (Wake up, wake up) 
 I know today gonna be the best day of my life 
 (Wake up, wake up) 
 Gotta keep my head out the clouds and my feet on the ground
