Olds school flow 
 Yo, yo, yo, yo 
 They used to say 
 They used to say 
 This rap shit 
 They used to say (He's dreamin') 
 They used to say (He's dreamin') 
 This rap shit (is not for real) 
 This rap shit (is not for real) 
 They used to say (He's dreamin') 
 They used to say (He's dreamin') 
 This rap shit (is not for real) 
 This rap shit (is not for real) 
 (Big K.R.I.T - Verse 1) 
 Yeah I remember it so clearly 
 Rappin' to my pop about the cars and the clothes 
 Shrimp and the lobster that I heard about 
 Like word of mouth 
 The UGK tape and Scarface will turn ya out 
 I was like 13 thirsting for a good beat 
 Scoping for a studio talkin' bout I spit heat 
 Like Ball & G, on that pimp type shit 
 36 had me crunk on that late night tip 
 They say (He's dreamin') 
 They used to say (He's dreamin') 
 This rap shit (is not for real) 
 This rap shit (is not for real) 
 They used to say (He's dreamin') 
 They used to say (He's dreamin') 
 This rap shit (is not for real) 
 This rap shit (is not for real) 
 (Big K.R.I.T - Verse 2) 
 I played ball for a minute, did I mention wasn't in it 
 Writing rhymes on my glove so I will never forget em 
 Had to quit it, didn't feel it back in high school 
 Rather write poems, known for flowing, that's what I do 
 Couldn't be little Zac forever, peace to my big brother 
 Follow ya dreams baby, that's word to my grandmother 
 When I hear the streets tappin', my beats kickin' my flow 
 I overhear the same shit they always say before (he's dreaming) 
 (Big K.R.I.T - Verse 3) 
 I told them call me KRIT, they told me change my name 
 Don't be alarmed if you don't make it, that's just part of the game 
 Besides I ain't rapping about dope nor did I sell it 
 I guess the story of a country boy just ain't compelling 
 A&R's searching for a hit, I just need a meal 
 Couldn't afford to pay the rent, but passed up on the deal 
 Cause, it wasn't right sometimes you gotta wade the storm 
 In a class of my own, but I was scared to raise my arm 
 Like, this my dream, this my life, I sacrificed it all 
 Except my soul in the firm belief there is a God 
 Watching out, when all the others used to doubt 
 Felt my pain and pointed down and said "Son, your time is now" 
 I think my grandma pulled some strings on the low 
 That's between her and the lord I'll ever know 
 For those that caught me in the Spin, in Complex magazine, XXL, the Vibe and whatever inbetween 
 It's safe to say that dreams come true I guess 
 Don't let nobody tell ya, try for yourself 
 Just know that I was once considered just a dreamer 
 But I paid my dues and turned so many doubters to believers 
 They used to say 
 They used to say 
 They used to say 
 They used to say 
 He's dreamin', he's dreamin', it's not for real, it's not for real 
 He's dreamin', he's dreamin', it's not for real, it's not for real 
 I don't care if it is a dream, I've got to believe in something I love 
 What can I do, what have I got to lose 
 You know sometimes dreams do come true 
 Might as well be a dream, dream, dream
