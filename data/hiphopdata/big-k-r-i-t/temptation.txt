Yeah' I'm tryna turn this into somethin' 
 Turn this into somethin' 
 Yeah' I'm tryna to turn this into somethin' 
 Turn this into somethin' 
 And we ain't tripping on the sun because the stars out 
 Chrome wheels, candy paint, bring the broads out 
 Yeah' I'm tryna turn this into somethin' 
 Turn this into somethin' 
 Yeah' I'm tryna to turn this into somethin' 
 Turn this into somethin' 
 And we ain't tripping on the sun because the stars out 
 Chrome wheels, candy paint, bring the broads out 
 Yeah I'm tryna turn this into somethin' on the go 
 Holler at my partner for some drank that I could pour 
 Sippin', candy dripping while I'm tippin' on them vogues 
 Horizontal sideways trunk might explode 
 Headed to the spot where the strippers show me love 
 'Cause they got them fire wings and I love to grub 
 Trying to get my mind off my bitch back at home 
 Searching for a freaky bopper dying to turn me on 
 Yeah' I'm tryna turn this into somethin' 
 Turn this into somethin' 
 Yeah' I'm tryna to turn this into somethin' 
 Turn this into somethin' 
 And we ain't tripping on the sun because the stars out 
 Chrome wheels, candy paint, bring the broads out 
 Yeah' I'm tryna turn this into somethin' 
 Turn this into somethin' 
 Yeah' I'm tryna to turn this into somethin' 
 Turn this into somethin' 
 And we ain't tripping on the sun because the stars out 
 Chrome wheels, candy paint, bring the broads out 
 Yeah I'm tryna turn this into somethin' for the night 
 Gotta play it safe drop my bait while she bite 
 She sucking and she fucking well, that's just my type 
 It's something about that pussy when it's gushy under lights 
 She claims she knows my name and she seen me out in public 
 Finally got the nerve to speak to me 'cause she been crushin' 
 Agreeing in whatever that I tell her she'll bust it 
 I showed her what I'm bout and turned her out soon as I touched it 
 Yeah' I'm tryna turn this into somethin' 
 Turn this into somethin' 
 Yeah' I'm tryna to turn this into somethin' 
 Turn this into somethin' 
 And we ain't tripping on the sun because the stars out 
 Chrome wheels, candy paint, bring the broads out 
 Yeah' I'm tryna turn this into somethin' 
 Turn this into somethin' 
 Yeah' I'm tryna to turn this into somethin' 
 Turn this into somethin' 
 And we ain't tripping on the sun because the stars out 
 Chrome wheels, candy paint, bring the broads out 
 Yeah I'm tryna turn this into somethin' 'cause she 'bout it 
 Pimpin' put her in submission she could never doubt it 
 Stock legs, corn bread fed, she a stallion 
 Drank in my tank turn me up to a thousand 
 Crank it to the max while she shake it from the back 
 Claiming that she dyin' I'mma hit her with this 'Lac 
 Told her turn around and scrub the ground to the beat 
 Set that ass on my lap and whisper this to me 
 Yeah' I'm tryna turn this into somethin' 
 Turn this into somethin' 
 Yeah' I'm tryna to turn this into somethin' 
 Turn this into somethin' 
 And we ain't tripping on the sun because the stars out 
 Chrome wheels, candy paint, bring the broads out 
 Yeah' I'm tryna turn this into somethin' 
 Turn this into somethin' 
 Yeah' I'm tryna to turn this into somethin' 
 Turn this into somethin' 
 And we ain't tripping on the sun because the stars out 
 Chrome wheels, candy paint, bring the broads out
