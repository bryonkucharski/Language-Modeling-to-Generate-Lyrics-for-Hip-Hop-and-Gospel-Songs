I'm hydroplaning 
 It's been a long time since I felt this way 
 Since I- since I felt this way 
 Since I- since I felt this way 
 I'm hydroplaning 
 It's been a long time since I felt this way 
 Since I- since I felt this way 
 Since I- since I felt this way 
 I'm hydroplaning 
 It's been a long time since I felt this way 
 Since I- since I felt this way 
 Since I- since I felt this way 
 I'm hydroplaning 
 It's been a long time since I felt this way 
 Mix the drank with the dank got me got me got me 
 Thunder cracking, another day to be chillin' 
 Nothing to do but roll up and po' up and catch that feeling I had 
 Back when I was younger, used to bum from my partner's uncle 
 Had that smoke that smelled like dumpster 
 Something missing, I'm way too high to talk my pimping 
 So I sip my Remy, that's when I first got tunnel vision 
 Yeah I saw it clearly, sunshine never shine like this 
 When I was sober off in the yo I never rhymed like this 
 I think I'm tripping, no I'm high, no I'm throwed 
 Well all I know is that my world is super slow 
 I like this better, light as a feather, too fly too land 
 Too throwed to drive in this weather 
 I'm hydroplaning 
 I'm hydroplaning 
 It's been a long time since I felt this way 
 Since I- since I felt this way 
 Since I- since I felt this way 
 I'm hydroplaning 
 It's been a long time since I felt this way 
 Since I- since I felt this way 
 Since I- since I felt this way 
 I'm hydroplaning 
 It's been a long time since I felt this way 
 Since I- since I felt this way 
 Since I- since I felt this way 
 I'm hydroplaning 
 It's been a long time since I felt this way 
 Mix the drank with the dank got me got me got me 
 It's getting harder to explain the way I feel when I'm zoned 
 High as fuck, money stuck so don't call my phone 
 See I was young when I was tipping, but I wasn't tripping though 
 Perfect combination of elevation had me tipping slow 
 Fall asleep while we ride, cloud surf to my house 
 I never knew the strength of the drink until I melt away in my couch 
 And dream about the things I never had and all the places I couldn't go 
 Tried to play it cool around my folk but I was fucked up on the low 
 Eyes bloodshot red, can't get to my bed 
 Cup of lean in my stomach, ounce of smoke in my head 
 I ain't been this way in a while, it's cool, I need to relieve the stress 
 All the worries of this life and blew it out my chest 
 I'm hydroplaning 
 I'm hydroplaning 
 It's been a long time since I felt this way 
 Since I- since I felt this way 
 Since I- since I felt this way 
 I'm hydroplaning 
 It's been a long time since I felt this way 
 Since I- since I felt this way 
 Since I- since I felt this way 
 I'm hydroplaning 
 It's been a long time since I felt this way 
 Since I- since I felt this way 
 Since I- since I felt this way 
 I'm hydroplaning 
 It's been a long time since I felt this way 
 Mix the drank with the dank got me got me got me 
 Tryna hold on 
 But I'm steady getting higher as the sweet meets the fire again 
 Round 10, toe to toe with the green 
 See me I'm bobbing and weaving but he's choking me and cheating mane 
 Tryna train my lungs, to hang 
 'Cause I'm gonna be smoking till Kingdom Come 
 Sang the songs that chose to make people roll up the mota 
 (And feel good like they supposed ta) 
 Wanna stay grounded but somehow gravity pulls me up 
 Am I upside down? Man what the fuck 
 Going on mane, hydroplaning 
 As I'm going up, not going insane but 
 Out of control, feel like it's out of my hands 
 Let me grab a hold before I crash land 
 Because it's like I'm going crazy, hydroplaning 
 I'm hydroplaning!
