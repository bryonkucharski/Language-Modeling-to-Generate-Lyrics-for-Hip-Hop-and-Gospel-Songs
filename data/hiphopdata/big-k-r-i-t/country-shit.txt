Let me tell you 'bout this 
 Super fly, dirty, dirty 
 Third coast muddy water 
 Shawty, pop that pussy if ya wanna 
 Let me tell you 'bout this 
 Old school, pourin' lean 
 Candy yams and collard greens 
 Pocket fulla stone, ridin' clean 
 Let me tell you 'bout this country shit 
 Country, country shit (Country, country shit) 
 Let me tell you 'bout this country shit 
 Country, country shit (Country, country shit) 
 Let me tell you 'bout this country shit 
 Country country shit (Country, country shit) 
 Let me tell you 'bout this country shit 
 Country country shit, yeah, country shit 
 I told 'em, aw man, hold up 
 What you know about it? 
 Candy cars, superstars 
 Rubber bands in my pocket 
 A couple broads for the poppin' 
 If she ridin' then she boppin' 
 Bitch, I'm sellin' if you shoppin' 
 If you need it then I got it 
 If I want it then I cop it 
 If you don't like, nigga, top it 
 Why you worried 'bout mine, hoe? 
 What's off in your wallet? 
 I was ridin' my screw shit 
 Rims chop choppin' 
 Top dropping throwin' bread crumbs 
 Crows start flockin' 
 Knockin' pictures off the wall 
 We sit tall, we still crawl 
 We still shoot, we still score 
 We still win so we still ball 
 We still hood so fuck the law 
 I got nuts and I got loot 
 If you can't see the king 
 In a nigga like me undoubtedly 
 Well, fuck him too 
 Let me tell you 'bout this 
 Super fly, dirty, dirty 
 Third coast muddy water 
 Shawty, pop that pussy if ya wanna 
 Let me tell you 'bout this 
 Old school, pourin' lean 
 Candy yams and collard greens 
 Pocket fulla stone, ridin' clean 
 Let me tell you 'bout this country shit 
 Country, country shit (Country, country shit) 
 Let me tell you 'bout this country shit 
 Country, country shit (Country, country shit) 
 Let me tell you 'bout this country shit 
 Country country shit (Country, country shit) 
 Let me tell you 'bout this country shit 
 Country country shit, country country shit 
 Okay, the caddy still swangin' 
 And the trunk still bangin' 
 Nigga trickin' ain't pimpin', shawty 
 What is y'all thinkin'? 
 What, what, what is y'all sayin'? 
 What, what, what is y'all sangin'? 
 Hit the club by the bar 
 Like what is y'all drankin'? 
 Old school, foreign cars, shawty 
 What is y'all crankin'? 
 Kush blunts, bank tellers ask me 
 Why is y'all stankin'? 
 If it's money I chill, shawty 
 Why is y'all playin'? 
 She was bound to fuck a pimp 
 So why is you carin'? 
 Save the hoe 
 Cape crusader and her service aidin' hoe 
 Dame the hoe, blame the hoe 
 For the same shit you pay me fo' 
 Shake it mo' for a pimp 
 With my shrimp on my plate 
 Countryfied, country fly with a tape 
 Let me tell you 'bout this 
 Super fly, dirty, dirty 
 Third coast muddy water 
 Shawty, pop that pussy if ya wanna 
 Let me tell you 'bout this 
 Old school, pourin' lean 
 Candy yams and collard greens 
 Pocket fulla stone, ridin' clean 
 Let me tell you 'bout this country shit 
 Country, country shit (Country, country shit) 
 Let me tell you 'bout this country shit 
 Country, country shit (Country, country shit) 
 Let me tell you 'bout this country shit 
 Country country shit (Country, country shit) 
 Let me tell you 'bout this country shit 
 Country country shit, country country shit
