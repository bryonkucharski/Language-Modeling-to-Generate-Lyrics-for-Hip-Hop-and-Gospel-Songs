Good Lord we back one mo' 'gin 
 This for the people, this for the have-nots... 
 I know what you going through 
 I know what you dealing with on the daily, you feel me? 
 Ain't nothing but sunshine from here... 
 Let's get high 
 Sippin' on this drank don't ease my pain 
 Lord, I wish it would 
 Smoking all this weed don't make me sane 
 But it should 
 In a world that's down and out 
 In a world that's down and out 
 I got my back against the wall 
 Once again, I've been cornered 
 Smoke that roach from my ash tray 
 From the other day and down this last Corona 
 That I scrape for, gotta make more 
 Gotta get mine 'cause when I get time 
 I'mma get shine and clear my runway 
 And wait till I get signed 
 To stretch my wings and fly 
 Do what I gotta do to get by 
 See the world through my third eye 
 Would answer the things I worried about 
 At the end of days, bills to pay 
 If it's a white man's world, am I still a slave 
 To the minimum wage? 
 Keep words minimal, subliminal 
 Y'all won't make it anyway 
 Out the traps they set 
 Follow them tracks they left to the White House 
 And tell Oprah Winfrey I don't need no chicken 
 Bitch is gonna turn my lights out 
 On a daily basis 
 Piece of American Pie they cut me, I can barely taste it 
 But I know it ain't 'bout shit cause my grandma ain't make it 
 Sippin' on this drank don't ease my pain 
 Lord, I wish it would 
 Smoking all this weed don't make me sane 
 But it should 
 In a world that's down and out 
 In a world that's down and out 
 Can't take that for granted though 
 I'm still searching for antidotes 
 Niggas outchea sick from the money they spent 
 Trying to get more cars and clothes and hoes 
 That really know they poles, is that on earth winning y'all? 
 Is every woman in a sundress, really down for the cause? 
 I can't be sure, nowadays everybody 'bout dough 
 About the play, a queen to be? A gold digger? I can't even say 
 But either way I strap up, wrap up 
 'Cause I don't want no capsules after 
 A rock-a-bye that I deny 'cause she stay on heads like tassels 
 And that's not to say ain't no queens around my way 
 I seen one the other day, but she had bruises on her face 
 And cried to me that men ain't shit and she fed up 
 They only want her with her legs up 
 Even though her nose swollen and eye was closed 
 I told her keep her head up 
 Sippin' on this drank don't ease my pain 
 Lord, I wish it would 
 Smoking all this weed don't make me sane 
 But it should 
 In a world that's down and out 
 In a world that's down and out
