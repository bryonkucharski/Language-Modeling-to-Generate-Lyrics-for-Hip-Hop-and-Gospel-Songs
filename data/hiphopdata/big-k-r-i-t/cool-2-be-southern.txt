We make it cool to be southern 
 We make it cool to be southern 
 We make it cool to be southern 
 We make it cool to be southern 
 We make it cool to be southern 
 Okay I'm straight up off my grandmama porch 
 Hollywood now, I took the southernized approach 
 Collard green pockets but I southern fried the flow 
 Candied yam drop with some cornbread to throw 
 Play some shit, keep the dank lit 
 We swang whips old schools like my paw-paw 
 You can't get 
 Now which motherfuckers said that we can't pimp? 
 I hit ditches like switches, before the paint flip 
 I can't be faded 
 The heart of king born in the 1980's 
 For real, you never see a nigga like me lately 
 Debonair, never scared, Fred Astaire when I carry a cadence 
 Refrain for being lame, ho 
 I got a surefire way to give the game what it came for 
 A third coast nigga still bustin', stop frontin' motherfucker 
 We make it cool to be southern 
 I'm talking about the dirty south, folks with the grills in mouth 
 We make it cool to be southern 
 Everybody wanna ball nowadays, but don't nobody wanna get paid 
 We make it cool to be southern 
 Get down if you wanna, crackin' seals, blowin' some mari-j-uana 
 We make it cool to be southern 
 Return of 4eva all day, them country people feel what I say 
 We make it cool to be southern 
 Let me take you down this country road 
 Country flow, country foe, country fire 
 24's on the Caddy, type savvy 
 My paper ways never fade, I got 'em from my grand daddy 
 Old school, so smooth 
 The type of fresh that you can comb through 
 Or you can cut it with a butter knife 
 And spread it on the brain of a dame for some change 
 But that's only if you cut it right 
 Off top my drop, rims chop, no cops, drink pop 
 Lord knows I ain't seen it with my 
 Green lit, grain grip, bad bitch on my tip 
 And when she tell me, lord knows she don't mean it 
 I been this way since I was knee high 
 To a grasshopper gettin' money in my Levis 
 I mean my genes, Pine-Sol clean 
 Bird's eye view with my frame on lean 
 We make it cool to be southern 
 I'm talking about the dirty south, folks with the grills in mouth 
 We make it cool to be southern 
 Everybody wanna ball nowadays, but don't nobody wanna get paid 
 We make it cool to be southern 
 Get down if you wanna, crackin' seals, blowin' some mari-j-uana 
 We make it cool to be southern 
 Return of 4eva all day, them country people feel what I say 
 We make it cool to be southern 
 Get down, get down, get down with it 
 Get down, get down, get down with it 
 Get down, get down, get down with it 
 Get down, get down, get down with it 
 I'm talking about the dirty south, folks with the grills in mouth 
 I make it cool to be southern
