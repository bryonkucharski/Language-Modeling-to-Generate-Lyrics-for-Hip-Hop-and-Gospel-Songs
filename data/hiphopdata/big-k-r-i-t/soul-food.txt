Big KRIT: 
 What happened to the soul food? 
 What happened to the soul food? 
 I'm talkin' good eatin', good seasonin' 
 Raphael Saadiq: 
 Out here in this world, just tryna make it 
 Everything I see, sometimes I can't take it 
 But damn I really miss those times 
 That soul food's on my mind 
 Mind, mind, mind 
 Big K.R.I.T.: 
 Grandma's hands used to usher Sunday mornings 
 Now before Sunday school, I hustle and I'm on it 
 I can't slow down, nah, a dollar and a dream 
 In this life you live, you're either the dealer or the fiend 
 Leanin' horizontal 
 The acrobats on the corner, they flip 
 So when them white vans pull up, shawty, we dip 
 Out of view, could've been a track star at the school 
 But it took the police just to get that .44 out of you 
 Dash, sprint, hurdle, over those steel gates 
 They keep us in and keep folk out but we don't feel safe 
 As we used to back when we was in a booster 
 Watchin' our uncles drink coolers, talkin' pound-for-pound bruisers 
 Over rib bones 
 Now I sideways tote 
 How did Bobby Johnson hold it? 
 Pull the trigger till the clip gone 
 Potato tip, no potato salad 
 That American pie ain't even snappin' 
 Raphael Saadiq: 
 Out here in this world, just tryna make it 
 Everything I see, sometimes I can't take it 
 But damn I really miss those times 
 That soul food's on my mind 
 Mind, mind, mind 
 Big K.R.I.T.: 
 Aromas on the corner, these the soul, they say 
 Some greens just can't be cleaned and you can't wash out the taste 
 Of rotten roots 
 Salted looks and herbs 
 If it ain't made with love then it ain't fit to serve, I heard 
 Some get bruised and battered 
 Thrown away half eaten as if their seeds never ever mattered 
 It ain't ripe, it ain't right 
 That's why most people don't make love no more 
 They just fuck and they fight 
 What happened to the stay-togethers? 
 Yeah, I'm with you. And that means forever 
 Grandparents had that kind of bond 
 But now we on some other shit 
 Nah, we ain't got no rubbers here 
 I know she creepin' so that ain't my son 
 Apples fall off of trees and roll down hills 
 We can't play games no more 'cause we got bills 
 Back in the day, the yard was oh so filled 
 Now nobody comes around here 
 Raphael Saadiq: 
 Out here in this world, just tryna make it 
 Everything I see, sometimes I can't take it 
 But damn I really miss those times 
 That soul food's on my mind 
 Mind, mind, mind 
 Big K.R.I.T. & (Raphael Saadiq): 
 (Never thought it'd be, no soul food on my plate 
 We gather 'round and lie, bow our heads and pray 
 And I) 
 I still remember, the family parties 
 The happy faces, no broken hearts 
 Nobody starvin', but all that there is old news 
 What happened to the soul food? 
 Raphael Saadiq:
