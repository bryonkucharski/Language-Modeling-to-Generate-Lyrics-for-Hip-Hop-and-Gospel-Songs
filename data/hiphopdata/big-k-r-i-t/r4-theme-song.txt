Refrain from bein lame, say it like you mean it 
 Get up of your feet like it's the first time you've seen it 
 Music is my bitch, let nothing come between us, can't no one do it better ho, it's the return forever, forever, forever, forever, forever, forever, forever, forever, forever... 
 They hollerin' bout time, that's what they told me 
 You want this money don't be scared ho show me 
 Old school, I'm pushin hella flats 
 I'm workin' wheels, crackin' seals, breakin pro's backs 
 Never change, I can't be Hollywood 
 I'm way too country, plus I'm bumpin' in my neighborhood 
 5th wheel, comin' out hard 
 Cause all I wanted was some rims on the candy car 
 3rd coast, now what you know about it 
 I keep it trill, never slippin' you should never doubt it 
 Pimp tight, picture perfect frame, never trickin on these dames, refrain from bein lame 
 Refrain from bein lame, say it like you mean it 
 Get up of your feet like it's the first time you've seen it 
 Music is my bitch, let nothing come between us, can't no one do it better ho, it's the return forever, forever, forever, forever, forever, forever, forever, forever, forever... 
 They hollerin' hold up, look I can't slow it down 
 Too much to prove, if it ain't money I can't come around 
 Multi, that's what I'm known for 
 I'm never comfy, came from nothin' bitch I want more 
 Don't play, you know the score fo'real 
 I kept it country, and I've been country even with a deal 
 Still fly, can't keep a player down 
 Mainstream is cool but in my heart forever underground 
 Thank god, make due with what I have 
 I grew up poor, fuck what you heard I ain't goin' back 
 R-4, I'm lettin my nuts hang, never trickin on these dames, refrain from bein lame 
 Refrain from bein lame, say it like you mean it 
 Get up of your feet like it's the first time you've seen it 
 Music is my bitch, let nothing come between us, can't no one do it better ho, it's the return forever, forever, forever, forever, forever, forever, forever, forever, forever... 
 Now remember, now you've got to go out there and you gotta work like nobody's ever worked before... 
 Can you dig it?
