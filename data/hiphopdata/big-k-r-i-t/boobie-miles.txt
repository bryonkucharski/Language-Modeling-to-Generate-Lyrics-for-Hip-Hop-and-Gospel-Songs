Get money, don't be no lame 
 Bench warmers never ride foreign, so play the game 
 Never drop the ball, never accept a loss, get back up if you fall 
 And when your number's called, you better give your all 
 I hope you give your all 
 You gotta play until the end 
 The only difference between a winner and a loser is 
 A winner plays until he wins 
 Ain't nothing for free so get your ass up 
 My partner said if we don't speed then they might pass us 
 So we hit 85, trying to keep this dream alive 
 All I see is green, I think these screens is fucking with my sight 
 Nowadays hoes claiming that they crushing 
 Bop a darling in my bucket 'til their heads catch concussions 
 But please don't push my buttons, I don't know you like that 
 Can't do no favors for these haters, I don't owe you like that 
 Well, I guess it's the allure like when you need to score 
 One second on the clock and the shot's all yours 
 Hit or miss, we take the risk 
 'Cause anything is better than Viennas and warm grits 
 Trading bust it babies for fly divas that buck 
 Her only concern is if my car match her clutch 
 Yeah, she's a gold digger but that pussy good 
 So what the fuck, don't be late for this player's ball 
 Hurry up and 
 Get money, don't be no lame 
 Bench warmers never ride foreign, so play the game 
 Never drop the ball, never accept a loss, get back up if you fall 
 And when your number's called, you better give your all 
 I hope you give your all 
 You gotta play until the end 
 The only difference between a winner and a loser is 
 A winner plays until he wins 
 They told me life is what you make it 
 So what you been creating on your free time? 
 I'll lend you bars if you need rhyme or reason 
 Some people change, it's a part of life like seasons 
 Just be aware that everybody ain't your friend 
 They'll be gone with the wind, once your jump shot, don't go in 
 Or your ACL torn and you're a couple yards short 
 From a Super Bowl Championship and it was down 4 
 Gotta play the field, be willing to ride, willing to dive 
 For what you desire, call your pop fly but never collide 
 With other players that play the game 
 Don't be eager to run with crowds, stay in your lane 
 Pass the knowledge on to your team but carry the flame 
 'Cause it's yours and yours alone to brighten your way 
 Put God first and free your soul 
 'Cause even Olympic runners sometimes lose their gold so 
 Get money, don't be no lame 
 Bench warmers never ride foreign, so play the game 
 Never drop the ball, never accept a loss, get back up if you fall 
 And when your number's called, you better give your all 
 I hope you give your all 
 You gotta play until the end 
 The only difference between a winner and a loser is 
 A winner plays until he wins
