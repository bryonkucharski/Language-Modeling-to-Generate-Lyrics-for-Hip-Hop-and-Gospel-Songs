Like it was 1986, yeah I'm back bitch 
 Big money, subwoofer, Randy Savage 
 It was 1986, yeah I'm back bitch 
 MC 24 crawling through the traffic 
 It was 1986, yeah I'm back bitch 
 Rolling clean, hella screen, digi-dashed it 
 It was 1986, coldest year ever 
 Mama coulda cut me out the womb but she knew better 
 Digi my dash, this for the playas 
 That got them some golds and copped them some gators 
 Fresh than a motherfucker I knew what it took 
 The thing that I'm giving you couldn't get out a book 
 Now don't be tricking no hoes, don't be lending your ride 
 And if you fuck, wear a rubber 'cause they burning inside 
 If it don't pay whatcha asking then you wasting your time 
 If you can't get you no old school don't go fucking with mine

 It was 1986, coldest year ever 
 Mama coulda cut me out the womb but she knew better 
 Watching for jackers, scoping for law 
 They go to hating when I'm bassing 'cause I swang and I crawl 
 Scraping the wall, rubbing the curb 
 A chef with the whipping, my trunk shaken and stirred 
 I got a fetish for Chevys, an itch for the doller 
 On the hunt for a freak, down to fuck if she swallow 
 I be popping my collar till I'm dead in a tomb 
 Hell, I been popping my collar since I fell out the womb 
 Like it was 1986, yeah I'm back bitch

 Mama coulda cut me out the womb but she knew better 
 It feels good to have it 
 Knowing that I did what I could 
 It feels good to have it 
 I put the leather on top of the wood 
 It feels good to have it 
 I rode chrome all around my streets 
 It feels good to have it 
 To see it, to need it, to grab it 
 Feels good to have it
