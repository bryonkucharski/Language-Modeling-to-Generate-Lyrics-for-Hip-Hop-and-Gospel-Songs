Eve lyrics 
 "Life is so hard" 
 (Eve) 
 This song is a dedication to those strugglin and livin' on 
 For those who can't see the light, it's comin' 
 Stay strong, feel me... (echoes) 
 (Teena marie) 
 Ooh, yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 Yeah yeah, ooh, ooh... 
 (Chorus: teena marie) 
 Livin' life is so hard 
 Every day I pray to god 
 Tell him to send me light so I can touch my soul 
 And always know right from wrong 
 Livin' life is so hard 
 Every day I pray to god 
 Tell him to touch my heart so he can ease the pain 
 Anything to hide the scars 
 (Eve) 
 Uh, uh 
 Thank you god, I appreciate every blessin 
 Happiness to heartaches, take it as a lesson 
 I learned a lot in this year 
 Got a profession that keeps me stressin 
 Facin criticism, answerin questions 
 And you still keep me happy and healthy 
 Blessed with a mind to play the cards that life has dealt me 
 No doubt I struggle, I cry at times 
 Sometimes I wish I could live in a bubble 
 And it gets hard not to stray to trouble 
 I'm proud of me, got a family that holds me down 
 Real friends 'cause the other ones claim they don't know me now 
 But long as God with me, I'ma be good for sure 
 He's the one who picks me up when my face is to the floor 
 Life is crazy, people never cease to amaze me 
 Stay with stories by how they made me or raised me 
 And it's funny, 'cause everybody seems to be so hungry 
 Either they want my life, or they want my money 
 (Teena marie) 
 How can life be so hard? 
 How can my life be so hard? 
 Whatever doesn't kill me makes me strong 
 Whatever doesn't kill me makes me strong 
 Every day I pray to god 
 Every day I pray 
 Whatever doesn't kill me makes me strong 
 Whatever, whatever, whatever 
 (Eve) 
 Uh, been through a lot 
 Still gotta watch my back 'cause people plot 
 Close is to do you dirty just so they can take your spot 
 Some days I feel like I wanna quit 
 But I pray too long and dreamed and worked too hard for it 
 Wouldn't trade my life, none even a little bit 
 Cause it could be worse for real, I could be turnin' tricks 
 Might bitch and whine but always just in the back of my mind 
 I could be livin' on the streets, nothin' to eat without a dime 
 So I thank god, and I think why 'cause life's hard 
 Meet a lot of people but always I'm puttin' up my guard 
 Cause you never know, some people snakes 
 Some people give a lot but mostly not, most people take 
 A lot of smilin' claimin realness but most people fake 
 Still gotta smile, 'cause that's what it takes 
 Sometimes it's lonely 
 I feel like people see me really don't know me 
 But my best friend is him, and I know he'll hold me 
 (Eve) 
 Uh, uh 
 I got a lotta people on my side protectin me 
 Dee, waah, chivon, and the family 
 Gotta thank God for them 'cause they keep me right 
 I also thank him every day for the love of my life 
 I thank him, for this gift just to be able to write 
 And rock crowds that scream my name, able to excite 
 Thank God for my fans; I love the way they love me 
 Happy that I'm comfortable, eatin, livin' lovely 
 I love my life, still there's the pressure and pain 
 So I make sure that I'm grounded and able to maintain 
 Alotta people think I'm lucky, travelin and hangin' out 
 But if they only knew, I +wish+ I could be hangin' out 
 I'm bangin' out hits, in the studio I'm livin' low 
 Makin' plans to last a lifetime, make sure I'm gettin' dough 
 Huh, come on, just so the people know 
 Uh, come on, just so the people know
