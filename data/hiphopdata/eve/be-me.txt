I'm just trying to be me... to be me 
 (Chorus: 2X's) 
 One... 'Cause I really wanna see the world 
 Two... Always knew I was a super girl 
 Three... Staying laced in diamonds and pearls (to be me) 
 That's the way you gotta treat a girl 
 (Verse One) 
 When I was broke cats was like do that 
 Uh oh 
 Now that I got something cats is like screw that 
 They wish I could've blew that 
 Back with them complaining 
 I move on speak shit so far from so long 
 Spassing, stressed out, not maintaining 
 Blew up called me cherry bomb 
 You the one that made me go forth and go on 
 Changed my hair from blonde 
 Mad 'cause I can go investigate the whole Gucci line 
 Publishing's a motherfucker baby and I own mines 
 Let me live niggas, did this with my own rhymes 
 Worked hard... I deserve the best in life 
 She stay clean... I deserve to be dressed up right 
 She spits mean... God definitely blessed her right 
 We can all buy diamonds and furs nothing to tell 
 We can all buy the mall with nothing to sell 
 Your career's dead wrong, change your style, wear a vail 
 Chorus: 2x's 
 Mad 'cause we got shit 
 Dropped what I dropped shit 
 (Verse Two) 
 All we do is drop hits 
 Mad 'cause we killing it 
 Long cash, twenty-one, investigating in stock shit 
 Call the ??? long so I could cock shit 
 Now I'm supposed to down play all the things I want in my life 
 Got my own money now, ain't gotta be nobody wife 
 Only if I want to, not 'cause I need to 
 Choose the situations I do and do not go through 
 I told you I was gonna make it big, gonna grow 
 This is dedicated to all of the haters that didn't know 
 Talking about me made people wonder who she was 
 But they know who it was 
 Haters created my buzz 
 And I'm here now 
 Going on my second year now 
 Fuck it, we could take it there, keep at a stare down 
 Now I think that my message is clear now 
 That bitch E-V-E singing what you hear now 
 Chorus: 2x's 
 (Verse Three) 
 Traveling to me away was Atlantic City 
 Now, float me in a boat in the Atlantic feel me 
 Gotta come to the table with something 'cause I got mine 
 Gotta spoil Eve royally, not just like pipe line 
 I said it before, I can fill my own belly 
 Say I ain't your type (lying), matches make you jelly 
 Uh, need you for what 
 Get in where you fit in, if you can 
 Understand 
 I'mma keep it comfortable, that's my plan 
 I'm just trying to be me, bubble and Philly bitch 
 Coarse I'mma boss and floss, I ain't no silly bitch 
 Bet she come fully equipped from chips to whip 
 Keys to her own crib, big shit to grip 
 I'm living it down, so ya simmer it down 
 Went from Ooh sheek to Oh I remember her now 
 Niggas couldn't stand her, now they wanna give her a pound 
 Wanna know her cause my feet is planted in the ground 
 Chorus: fades away
