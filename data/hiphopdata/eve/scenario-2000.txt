(Swizz Beatz) 
 See y'all don't understand us you know 
 Ruff Ryderz is a family 
 Ruff Ryderz... Ruff Ryderz... Ruff Ryderz 
 Lets go... Swizz Beatz 
 (DMX) 
 This is the darkest shit sparkest shit 
 Hittin wit the hardest shit 'cause before we started shit 
 Wit kidz I knew my fuckin' friendz all turned against me 
 Said fuck it bought me a dog ever since me and my dog has been like this 
 He got my back I got his schemin on mad niggaz 
 Dats how we do bidz 
 It's about time to start another, robbin spree 
 'Cause yo, my way is highway, robbery 
 When I was up north since 16 I was sendin niggaz home in a coffin 
 Livin' like a orphan, you bad nigga? 
 I'll be back to see if you'll be still here 
 You know my style will put yo fuckin' man, in a wheelchair 
 He'll never walk again, on the strength of me 
 Dats how I left him G, scared to death of me 
 Niggaz cannot run, hit wit da hot one 
 From the shotgun, catz was close wondered how we got done... 
 (Eve) 
 Yo yo, E-V-E 
 My dogz believe in me 
 Petty thugz hide yo cake, never teasin me 
 I show love to, all my bitches hustlin one'z, tussle wit these 
 Makin' moves, second to none, I locked it, huh 
 Made a sudden move you got bit 
 Flooded wit the double R, real street shit 
 Da blond hair bandit, you got gunz, hand it 
 Turn my face when I bust a cannon 
 'Cause I don't wear sunblock 
 Ask Drag if the fire is hot (Flame On baby) 
 Shit pop shellz, fall three feet, roll over and stop 
 We warn niggaz that we comin', then we total the block 
 We scorn niggaz like they mothers, then we wet up they socks 
 Red dot, excapin on a radar, to seashore, then hide out 
 And buy out bars till we see far 
 In this game, we beat y'all, you got money? 
 Keep y'alls, for us be tearin tryin' to hide, then tear out fire 
 Beat y'alls 
 (JadaKiss) 
 And you can come see me if you tryin' to 
 Get some gramz for the night 
 'Cause I can get it for you raw, gray, tan or white 
 Fuck rap yo, I'd rather be plannin the flights 
 Somewhere hot on a wave runner, tanning wit dykes 
 Blowin' the haze, while all of 'em givin' me brains 
 One at a time, y'all start from the front of the line 
 But everybody wanna contact me, and get wit me 
 And still end up bein mad 'cause I charge 50 
 And as for you suckaz, you can keep those rapz 
 And screw yo awardz, my son can't eat those plaques 
 I never was shipped but some thingz I never forget 
 Like if you spent three you guaranteed to make back six 
 Drove the Benz off the lot and just dusted her off 
 Tints, rims, stashed, tick the governor off 
 Even the catz that be hatin' still be lovin' the dogz 
 'Cause they know that the double R's comin' for war 
 Wha 
 (Styles) 
 You ain't ready to die, then why should you live? 
 'Cause when I start bustin' the gunz you hidin the kids 
 And the Pieer's still ridin' wit clips, survivin wit bricks 
 We beefin on the 4th you got to die on the 5th 
 Like I wasn't hustlin dope or robbin the blocks 
 Starvin or not, carvin the cheek, palmin the glock 
 I figure which nigga could I watch wit a watch 
 I like to knock off my crack then I pull off a heist 
 Put it together, double it twice this shit is my life 
 Catch me wit a .45, hot pair of Nikes 
 And three red dice, like, give me the bank or gimmie yo face 
 Gimmie a shank It's Holiday (Uh) 
 The hooptie's in the front but the truck is a mile away 
 Niggaz wanna ride tomorrow when they'll probabaly die today 
 'Cause da Pio'll hollow the gunz 
 Then holla at son (I feel you nigga) 
 And when he go to holla back, niggaz swallowin one 
 (Sheek) 
 Y'all dem bust in them crowd niggaz and hit whoever 
 When you should aim for them niggaz that took yo leather 
 They right there, but you scared that they gon bust 
 'Cause they crazy, but crazy niggaz bleed like us 
 See I'm one shot through the heart like Cupid 
 Y'all niggaz might be crazy, but y'all not stupid 
 It's 99, I'm killin' you, woman and kid 
 Fuck Scarface, watch me, I'm mo action to see 
 Than the muthafuckaz that y'all see on TV 
 And fuck what you heard, check how Sheek get down 
 Comes the gun, shit, I'm rhymin wit one on me now 
 You neva know, what clown could walk in the studio 
 Talkin' shit, and there's gon be more than the amps that blow 
 I'll pour gas on yo skin and watch yo shit detach 
 Wit a book of matches, now dats when you met yo match 
 And the worst thing for you is for me to have a gun when I'm thirsty 
 I'll turn niggaz more Holy Man, than Eddie Murphy 
 And I deal wit mo bricks than that city do in Jersey 
 I got call cops niggaz 
 I got autops niggaz, that'll bust you and slide 
 Wit some of 6-drop niggaz 
 Revolver Pop niggaz, easy Ox niggaz, get knocked 
 Say I smoked detox niggaz 
 Drug program, hit the streetz and cop 56 mo gramz 
 Y'all niggaz ain't fuckin' wit the fam and dats word 
 (Drag-On) 
 Hey yo boy, what's the difference between fire and water? 
 You whether drown or die off torture, cause yo skins of ya 
 And watch ya burn off fat, dog I'm off the thermostat 
 Could put a comb to my mouth and give yo bitch a perm wit that 
 Keep shellz in the envelopes 'cause I'll mail out bullets 
 More blood that a riot on a jailhouse footage 
 Buck 40, got a extra 20 wit the semi, when it hit you 
 You gon do a 360 pretty swiftly 
 When I burn you to a crisp you gon be crunchier than chips 
 Wit my hand all up in the bag, munchin on this shit 
 Bit by bit, clip by clip and every block by block is brick on brick 
 So I got knots on knots, got thingz that'll pop yo top 
 And double R spot yo block wit 16 shots and watch y'all drop 
 And ain't nobody gettin' up, lest they in the wheelchair 
 Sittin' up or spittin' up, either way I don't give a fuck
