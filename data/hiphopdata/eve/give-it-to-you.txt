Give It To You - Eve 
 Yo yo yo (Yo) 
 Yo yo yo (Yo) 
 Ha 
 Yo yo yo yo 
 Yo yo yo yo 
 Well all my love I give it to you girl, my life I'll live it with you girl 
 Worth more to the eye man, than a diamond and a pearl (diamonds and them pearls) 
 So just give it to me girl, and a live it with me girl... I wanna rock your world 
 I heard about it happenin' 
 I never thought it could be 
 The way he looked into my eyes 
 Things he doin' to me 
 He caught me by surprise 
 He opened up my life 
 He wasn't like them other dudes 
 I wanna be his wife 
 He said he got played 
 I told him don't be scared 
 My mission make ya' mine 
 Forget the rest 
 They ain't prepared 
 He said he liked my style 
 I said I liked his lips 
 He took my hand 
 And his hand 
 And then he told me this 
 Well all my love I give it to you girl, my life I'll live it with you girl 
 Worth more to the eye man, than a diamond and a pearl (diamonds and them pearls) 
 So just give it to me girl, and a live it with me girl... I wanna rock your world 
 You ever met a dude 
 You can't get out yo mind 
 You go to sleep 
 He in your dreams 
 He with you all the time 
 This was the way it was 
 Thought it was meant to be 
 Till I picked up the phone one night 
 And it was Tiffany 
 She said he was her dude 
 I said is that a fact 
 She said I let him go and play 
 But he always come back 
 I said that can't be true 
 She said it always is 
 I hung up, heart was struck 
 'Cause couldn't believe this shit 
 Well all my love I give it to you girl, my life I'll live it with you girl 
 Worth more to the eye man, than a diamond and a pearl (diamonds and them pearls) 
 So just give it to me girl, and a live it with me girl... I wanna rock your world
