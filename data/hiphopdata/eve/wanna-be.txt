(Missy) 
 Yeah, I'm back in this joint right here 
 For all my people who 
 Who sick of playin' seconds and 
 And takin' somebody's leftovers 
 Get out the back seat, take the passenger seat 
 Ya know what I'm sayin'? 
 Heh, y'all feel me? Y'all feel me? 
 Hear me out 
 (Tamia) 
 Is it me or her babe? 
 You gotta make your decision 
 'Cause you got the wrong impression 
 I don't want nobody's seconds 
 I just want all of you babe 
 I'm used to gettin' what I like 
 Just to curve my appetite 
 Serve you on a plate with a first class wine 
 (Tamia) 
 I wanna be the girl you take to your crib 
 And not the girl you hate to show where you live 
 I wanna be the girl for you all your life 
 And not the girl you're pickin' up late at night 
 (Tamia) 
 Let's be truthful please 
 Will she always be around? 
 I need to know right here and now 
 Can I bury her underground? 
 I just want all of you babe 
 And she's always in the way 
 And she's always in your face 
 Am I the one who's being played? 
 (Tamia) 
 I wanna be the girl you take to your crib 
 And not the girl you hate to show where you live 
 I wanna be the girl for you all your life 
 And not the girl you're pickin' up late at night 
 (Missy) 
 Not your chick on the side 
 I wanna be your main chick 
 So you gon' have to pick 
 Between Lisa, Kim and Stacy, and whoever 
 Not your chick on the side 
 I wanna be your main chick 
 So you gon' have to pick 
 Between Lisa, Kim and Stacy, and whoever 
 (Tamia) 
 I wanna be the girl you take to your crib 
 And not the girl you hate to show where you live 
 I wanna be the girl for you all your life 
 And not the girl you're pickin' up late at night 
 I wanna be the girl you take to your crib 
 And not the girl you hate to show where you live 
 I wanna be the girl for you all your life 
 And not the girl you're pickin' up late at night
