[Swizz] 
 Uhh, yeah yeah yeah 
 Yo yo, come on 
 Come on Eve, Swizz Beats 
 Drag-On baby 
 [chorus Swizz]4x 
 We want y'all to move right now 
 [Drag-On] 
 Break 'em down 
 Put 'em up 
 Shake 'em down 
 Pat 'em down 
 Then bat 'em down 
 Get the gun 
 Gat 'em down 
 Get the rope tie 'em up 
 Strike a match lite 'em up 
 Then fly 'em up to the spot a pile of dust 
 Get the chips stack 'em up bag a bitch dig her out 
 Then kick 'em out let dogs sick 'em out 
 All I do is tell 'em get the tissue 
 I only fuck wit chicks that suck nuts out of pickles 
 You want problems? well I'll solve 'em and make examples 
 I love bustin out crowds so all people get trampled 
 Spit crowds wit the 4-5 
 Like when Moses split the tide 
 Those that froze chose to die 
 Stay higher than a hello, how you doin? 
 Burn the rubber till the tires ruin 
 Burn a coat of fire human 
 Cause this Drag 
 Burnin like the grits on Al Green's back 
 Causin a switch rock 
 [chorus]8x 
 [Swizz] 
 Hold on dog 
 Who want some of this, gun right here 
 All y'all clown niggas put your hands in the air 
 Is it you over there? Is it you over there? 
 Is it you, is it you, is it you right there? 
 Nigga, this ain't that shit that you used to bounce to 
 This that thing that you smoke a ounce to 
 I'm gonna do it, even without you 
 I pop all them clown niggas around you 
 This for my playas thats swingin the 4-4 
 Wildin out, bustin at po-po 
 Comin over here, you got to go yo 
 Y'all think y'all got beats it's so so 
 Swizz fallen off, nigga thats oh no 
 Y'all remain let the dogs go 
 Listen y'all I stick in the streets like cleetes 
 Y'all niggas know Swizz Beats uhh 
 [chorus]8x 
 [Eve] 
 Yo, yo ,yo 
 Nigga pack up, watch a pro player get her stack up 
 Cowards in my way any second then he plaqued up 
 Dogs all behind me roll out, section racked up 
 Simple situation blown away cause you backed up 
 Watch out now know you heard about the Ruff ryde 
 Deaded at the door watch the floor, who the tough guy? 
 Brick house run 'em down knwo what we about shut 'em down 
 Keep these niggas like "Here she comin now" 
 Yo in public yo I'm evil 
 Fuck wit only people that I know thats my peoples 
 The fake shit I see through 
 Hated just to be you cause faggots is lame 
 Get fucked say "Gettin fucked" nigga why change? 
 It's anotha that was sweet takin out 
 Anotha that I peep fakin out 
 Tryin to take the easy route 
 A yo look I hold it down got my back while we ride 
 It's over for you fake ass bitches come on and hide 
 Swizz!!
