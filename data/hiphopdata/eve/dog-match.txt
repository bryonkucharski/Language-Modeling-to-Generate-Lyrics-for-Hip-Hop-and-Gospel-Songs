 Ugh! (Whoa) Ugh!(Woo!) Ugh! Ugh! (Arf! Arf! Arf!) 
 Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! 
 Now for every real dog 
 There's that bitch that's behind him 
 That bitch that when that nigga get to missin' 
 She gon' find him 
 Old girl gonna stay with the dog 
 Hand in hand with the dog 
 And whatever the fuck went down she ran with the dog 
 First time I had a match and didn't scratch 
 You catch just loss half you niggas, but the punk can fetch 
 And I know my babygirl is gonna stretch 
 Any rappin' motherfucker, male or female 
 Place your bets 
 You can imagine what the bloodline is like 
 Since I love mine to fight 
 I'm on some shit like what time tonight 
 Y'all niggaz can't be for real 
 Cause any one of you faggots 
 Will catch a face full of lead 
 Bitch you shouldn't be faggots 
 Fuckin' maggots, once you have it, as good as I got it 
 I know my hands is in my pockets 
 But Eve got you spotted, red dotted 
 Eve didn't before the Dog 
 Nothin' but a war with tha bark 
 (Eve) 
 Always been the bitch that could roll with a thug and 
 Wipe up the blood 
 Roll in the mud with your other ducks nigga what? 
 What you need when the chips is down 
 I'll abide on the stand when evidence is found 
 I give pound to ya niggaz they respect this bitch 
 I spit rounds at your enemy no less than six 
 Always keep the extra clip Dog taught me well 
 The extra eyes on your team I see who's next to fail 
 Always hold your back up, I picked it up when you slack up 
 And if attention gets to close I tell the world to back up 
 Biting two time, rhymes who ride? 
 Bitch and your livin' lessons through life 
 Fuckin' with the dog he's a master 
 Plus he's gonna show me how to blast ya 
 Want attention then pass ya 
 Split you then stash you 
 The game is real, E-V-E, DMX, the name's for real, uh 
 1 - (DMX) 
 Fuckin' with the dog man niggaz keep beefin' 
 Eve will hold it down now, niggaz can believe (Woo!) 
 Quick as niggaz come and quick as they'll be leavin' (Ugh!) 
 Paramedics on your chest, pushin' and breathin' 
 (DMX) 
 Get 'em girl, ha-ha, that's my baby 
 I'mma put the bitch down, cause the boy got rabies 
 All my pups is crazy, cause off the leash 
 They can eat, stand and match defeat, out of the least 
 And if the beast is in the big one 
 The beast is in the little ones 
 Talkin' 'bout let's hit him son 
 Fuckin' with the little guns 
 Y'all niggaz had a little run 
 What more do you want? 
 For your fans you can front 
 But the dog is on the hunt 
 (Eve) 
 You know I'm at the door point fox rippin' 'em out 
 And you're the only one that can tame me 
 When I'm flippin 'em out 
 Bite's lethal, no recovering 
 I spitz no other than acid 
 Up against the top contenders 
 None of them lasted 
 This bitch gon always hold you down 
 Keep the cowards thinking twice 
 I keeps it gritty nigga 
 Never think that love is life 
 Turnin' my back is something cats would do 
 I never take flight 
 Cause any breed he put's me up against 
 This bitch is gonna bite 
 (DMX) 
 Ugh! Woo! 
 Ugh! Ugh! Woo! 
 Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Woo! Woo! 
 Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! 
 Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! 
 Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! 
 Ugh! Ugh! Woo!
