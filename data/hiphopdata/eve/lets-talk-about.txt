 Uh-uh-uh-uh (Flame on, uh, come on, uh) 
 Yo, yo (uh, uh)

 Let's talk about who I am 
 Blond bee, find me in the hood with my peoples 
 Love y'all, hate the rest of y'all that I can see through 
 Above that, I can't feel nothin' unless it's lethal 
 Testin' your moves, never that, make no position fetal, uh 
 (Drag-on) 
 I wanna talk about Dog nigga, L-O-X, Eve, and me 
 Now that's the hottest thing in the streets 
 Are beats is Swizz 
 Cheesed up with holes in the shit 
 Like a log rolled thick 
 And ain't nothin' sweet but Drag-Eve tracks 
 Honey Roasted 
 Burn until it's been around the hour, fuck that 
 (Eve) 
 Yo let's talk about 
 Platinum plaques, hangin' on my wall 
 See me decorated, she's the one 
 Heard 'em say it, see me celebrate 
 I pop shit when it's necessary, not for nothin' 
 I use clips for them big beefs 
 See me bustin', plow! 
 (Drag-on) 
 I wanna talk about bitches I fucked 
 I'm a dog so I can't stand no bitch that hounds 
 I far from a clown 
 If I'm not knocking her down, Drag's probably not around 
 So I'm not one to claim by either one of you dames 
 If y'all catch Drag with a mane, trust me 
 She got my last name 
 Here's the hook, uh 
 (Drag-on) 
 Now Drag gon' show y'all niggas how we lock this shit

 Let's talk about little dick niggas 
 Always talkin' bout what you got 
 Rather be finger-popped 
 Dick probably the size of a bough stuffed with rocks 
 Fuck the cop nigga, go shoot pool, pussy plot 
 You make me cum, I might flood the block, wet on my socks 
 (Drag-on) 
 I wanna talk about guns niggas don't bust 
 Y'all need to see me if y'all wanna see shells pop out 
 Make you say watch out, when I got my glock out 
 Niggaz clock out, 'cause I run up in your watch house 
 Snatch up all your rocks out 
 Then throw your box out 
 Ya motherfuckers better watch out 
 (Eve) 
 Yo, let's talk about fake ass bitches 
 Lying to yourself, you ain't ready for the world mama 
 Beggin' every second hungry, life drama 
 Get your own stacks 
 Why you think these niggaz pussy hungry 
 Cause you actin' triflin' 
 Layin' up, takin' his money, uh 
 (Drag-on) 
 I wanna talk about live or die 
 Fuck you and I 
 Niggas will fry like stripped bacon 
 I leave them shakin' 
 Keep 'em sizzlin' 
 Fuckin' with them you might win 
 But they only got six shots with a barrel that spin 
 And us our clip is spinning 
 And hittin' all their men 
 (Eve) 
 I wanna talk about ryde or die 
 My dogs control confrontation 
 In any situation 
 Five niggas on your team 
 Five niggas you replacing 
 Five niggas used to gleam 
 Five niggas left with nathan 
 But their game that we took 
 And now they back to chase it 
 (Drag-on) 
 I wanna talk about biting ass niggas 
 Let me see y'all niggas catch the flow 
 Go red-vest with the four-four blow 
 Ya niggaz gonna hit the ground for sure 
 Nigga let me know if you want more 
 If he catch you with a pound to choke, you know 
 Nigga never die slow, till his eyes close 
 Then jump on the highway, I go 
 Man fuck the po-po, them niggas is moving slow mo, come on 
 Here's the hook, uh
