 Beenie siegal 
 Philly is where I'm from 
 (Beenie siegal) 
 We from p-h-i-l-a period, pa period, eve they hearing it 
 Believe they fearing it, but loving it though 
 I hate the game, fuck the fame but I'm loving the dough 
 You couldn't tell me in a million years 
 And a thousands bars that I roam the reservoir with dogs 
 Show the world what crew love was about 
 Drop adrenaline. 4-5-6 
 I show them what a thug was about 
 I know you love flossing wit x, busting them checks 
 Getting tattoos, paw prints on your chest 
 I ain't mad, baby get that cash 
 Make them hating bitches kiss your ass 
 Ruff ryde lift that? 
 I'm gon walk till I see how these flee's gon feel 
 When I come through wit the whip with the bee's on the wheel 
 Burgundy thing, cream gut, cherry wood 
 Steering wheel, or be surround by the wing on the hood 
 I know they like how they collide 
 He roll wit roc, you ruff ryde but we black Friday tied 
 How you think they gon feel seeing us grammy night 
 Let me tell you, a bunch of if, and's and mics 
 Billboard charts, source ad and mics 
 And if I say so myself goddamn we tight 
 Fuck being humble ain't no other way to end this 
 We ain't open up the doors, we knocked that bitch up off the hinges 
 Philly, philly, 
 Philly where I am from 
 Philly, philly 
 Philly where I am from 
 Philly, philly 
 Philly where I am from 
 Philly, philly 
 Philly where I am from 
 (Eve) 
 Yo, yo yo 
 No doubt we represent p-h-i-l-a period, e-v-e eve period, fuck wit beenie period 
 We gon hold it down for illdelph for life 
 Came through made a name nigga nailed it tight 
 And now we shine, been knew, shit it was about time 
 Switched from streets the beats, platinum lines 
 Used to struggle in the hood just to brodie the mic 
 Took the fame 'cause they ain't give it us, now we excite 
 The biggest crowds and they screaming loud philly the shit 
 Rocc-a-fella rap guerrilla, blond bombshell bitch 
 I ruff ryde, take your mind shit you doing the same 
 Work hard now the streets stay shouting our names 
 Fame is funny, get money, snakes in the grass 
 When the hostility shows, niggas face get smashed 
 But I stay grounded, brick house stallion 
 My bitches keep me real while I make millions 
 Pile it all, we gon have it all any minute 
 Give it back the hood and we gon ball in a minute 
 Cause any thing we want, we gon have it on our plates 
 Matter of time before we killed the beans it was our fate 
 And cats were stressed, gave it all they expected less 
 Disrespect take it back the hood, protect your chest 
 Try to break us but we broke through 
 Got the job done, that's what's up we got the job done 
 Running shit now tell them where I am from 
 Philly, philly 
 Philly where I am from 
 Phily, philly 
 Philly where I am from 
 Philly, philly 
 Philly where I am from 
 Philly, philly 
 Philly where I am from 
 Philly, philly 
 Philly where I am from
