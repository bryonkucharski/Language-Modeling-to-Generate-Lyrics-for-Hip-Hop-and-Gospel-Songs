He's phony, she's fake 
 That's the type of people I hate 
 Hey, hey, hey, Jada, Jada, hey, hey, hey, Jada, Jada 
 Point 'em out, point 'em out, point 'em out 
 He's phony, she's fake 
 That's the type of people I hate 
 If you're real and you know it, clap your hands 
 If you're real and you know it, clap your hands 
 Wait a minute, who's real, who's not? 
 She's real but he's not 
 If you're real and you know it, clap your hands 
 If you're real and you know it, clap your hands 
 Yeah yo, guns go clack, packs go move 
 Blood gettin' draw, skin gon' bruise 
 'Cause real gon' win, the fake gon' lose 
 The love overpowers the hate by twos 
 All they left was the yellow tape in his shoes 
 It's real when the funeral wait to make the news 
 ? So we six up on 'em 
 So when they act corny, we jus' switch up on 'em 
 He's phony, she's fake 
 That's the type of people I hate 
 If you're real and you know it, clap your hands 
 If you're real and you know it, clap your hands 
 Wait a minute, who's real, who's not? 
 She's real but he's not 
 If you're real and you know it, clap your hands 
 If you're real and you know it, clap your hands 
 Who's phony, who's fake? 
 [Incomprehensible] on eights 
 Life's good, I'm straight 
 Clap your hands one at a time, you were late 
 Can't keep it 100 then the ones I hate 
 But I'ma keep it 200 for the ones they fake 
 Red and black cars on the red chrome stakes 
 Young Juiceman I should warn off my plates 
 He's phony, she's fake 
 That's the type of people I hate 
 If you're real and you know it, clap your hands 
 If you're real and you know it, clap your hands 
 Who's real, who's not? 
 She's real but he's not 
 If you're real and you know it, clap your hands 
 If you're real and you know it, clap your hands 
 Yeah yo, pocket full of cash, wallet fulla class 
 In and out the lane, dippin' through the traffic 
 We ain't hustlin' no more, we doin' gymnastics 
 Couple of flips and they stash it, vastly 
 Real gon' recognize real, phony gon recognize steel 
 I reckon I will 'xpose those who are, if you ain't what you are 
 I don't gon' too far, sorry, muah 
 Get yourself a fresh flesh or a new scar 
 Bullet holes on the side of your new car 
 Load up the are, spray yo, kayo 
 It's real on this side, phony where ever they are 
 He's phony, she's fake 
 That's the type of people I hate 
 If you're real and you know it, clap your hands 
 If you're real and you know it, clap your hands 
 Wait a minute, who's real, who's not? 
 She's real but he's not 
 If you're real and you know it, clap your hands 
 If you're real and you know it, clap your hands
