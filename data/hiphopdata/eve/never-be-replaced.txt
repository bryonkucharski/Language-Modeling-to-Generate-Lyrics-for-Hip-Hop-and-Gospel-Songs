Baby I love you and I'll never let you go 
 But if I have to boy I think that you should know 
 All the love we made can never be erased 
 And I promise you that you will never be replaced (2x) 
 I love you, yes I do 
 I'll be with you as long as you want me to 
 Until (until) the end (the end) of time 
 From the day I met you I knew we'd be together 
 And now I know I wanna be with you forever 
 I wanna marry you and I wanna have your kids 
 Thinking never compared to the feeling of your kisses 
 I can say I'm truly happy to this day 
 You make think I better live my life everyday 
 There's never been a doubt in my mind 
 That I regret ever having you by my side 
 But if the day comes that I have to let you go 
 I think there's somethin' I should probably let you know 
 I enjoyed everyday that I spend with you 
 And I will miss you but I'm happy that I even had you at all 
 Baby I love you and I'll never let you go 
 But if I have to boy I think that you should know 
 All the love we made can never be erased 
 And I promise you that you will never be replaced (2X) 
 I love you oh yes I do 
 I'll be with you as long as you want me to 
 Until the end of time
