 (Mo'nique) 
 Ain't nothing worse then a brotha 
 Who always bling blingin 
 Flossin, rollin' like he got it like dat 
 Always up in your face telling you what he got, 
 What he can bring to the table 
 And then it's like this nigga cinderella 
 'Cause he always dropping yo ass off at midnight 
 And you can't seem to understand 
 Why at midnight is he always dropping yo ass off? 
 'Cause let the truth be told, 
 He ain't bling blingin or sling slingin, 
 He ain't doin' shit! 
 That 500 benz he drivin' - that's his mamma's a 
 And that goddamn jewelry he wearin -all that shit is ridded 
 And at 12:01, they come and lock his bitch ass up 
 Now ain't that some shit?
