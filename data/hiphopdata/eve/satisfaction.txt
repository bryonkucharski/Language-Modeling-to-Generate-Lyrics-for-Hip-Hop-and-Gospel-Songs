Now I'ma do this thing like it ain't done before 
 Never leave the game stranded, I had to give more 
 I'ma give you what you want, what you waitin' for? 
 Make the music that the people can't ignore 
 A lotta niggas is bitches, a lotta bitches be trippin' 
 A lotta them be wishin' that they was in my position 
 A lotta niggas be cowards and most chicks be chickens 
 Fuck 'bout the CLUCK! CLUCK! Eve ain't trippin' 
 Most dudes is okay, half of the rest ain't 
 Talkin' 'bout what they wanna do, reality they can't 
 Ask 'em what they life worth, watch 'em draw a blank 
 I really ain't got no interest if it don't involve the bank 
 Most of the time I'm nice to 'em, half the time I'm not 
 It ain't nothin' new though, learned it from off the block 
 People think I changed much 'cause I'm livin' good 
 Now they get my voicemail, hear them callin' me rude? 
 Sometimes I feel bad, most of the time I don't 
 'Cause if I don't protect my shit, other niggas won't 
 Some want me to neglect my shit, take it for a joke?! 
 But I'm stayin' on the grind, never goin' back to broke 
 Anything I want' 
 I can get it 'cause I know I need it 
 You see me comin' and I know you heat it 
 Anything I need' 
 Gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it 
 Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction 
 Everything I am' 
 Just because I had to make it happen 
 They never thought that I would make it rappin' 
 Anything I need' 
 Gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it 
 Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction 
 You tryina enter through the back door? 
 Ain't nothin' happenin', 
 This whole ship is my ship bitch and I'm the captian 
 Can't beat me join me baby then get to clappin' 
 Bang it in ya whip to get ya neck snappin' 
 I know you hopin' that I rest so you can breathe 
 Stressed when we in the same places till I leave 
 Whisper to they friends what they wanna do to me 
 Wish they could erase me, take away the air I breathe 
 And I feed 'cause that shit only give me hunger pains 
 Never let you muhfuckas put out my flame 
 Ready for whatever, was trained to maintain 
 And I always been a savage 'bout the fame 
 Separate the girls from the women and the winnin' 
 Always knew the thrill was worth it from the beginnin' 
 Baby what's the deal I'm hurtin' 'em how I'm livin' 
 I gotta conquer it all now the world's my mission 
 Anything I want' 
 I can get it 'cause I know I need it 
 You see me comin' and I know you heat it 
 Anything I need' 
 Gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it 
 Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction 
 Everything I am' 
 Just because I had to make it happen 
 They never thought that I would make it rappin' 
 Anything I need' 
 Gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it 
 Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction 
 Ain't nothin' hotter than this heat y'all, it's like a magnet 
 I don't really mess wit too many 'cause they be plastic 
 That's it enjoy it boy, it's like magic 
 Anything less than a banger will not have it 
 Still I Ruff Ryde but I got my team 
 And we ain't goin' nowhere till we lock the game 
 But in the mean time ball while we live the dream 
 And now I need to hear y'all sing 
 Anything I want... 
 I can get it 'cause I know I need it 
 You see me comin' and I know you heat it 
 Anything I need' 
 Gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it 
 Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction 
 Everything I am' 
 Just because I had to make it happen 
 They never thought that I would make it rappin' 
 Anything I need... 
 Gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it 
 Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction (x2)
