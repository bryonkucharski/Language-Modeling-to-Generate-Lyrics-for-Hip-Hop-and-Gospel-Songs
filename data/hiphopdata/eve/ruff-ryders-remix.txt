This thing right here is for my people 
 In the streets, 
 (Swizz beats), and this thing right here will 
 Take ya ass of ya feet. 
 Verse one: drag-on 
 They call me drag-on 
 It's time to ball 
 I'm gonna burn'em all 
 To they all say turn'em off 
 These chips I gonna earn'em all 
 Chicken heads know I be the kernall 
 'Cause I burn internall 
 Mixed with the inferno 
 So be careful for I burn you 
 You better learn duke 
 Yeah, I heard you 
 But I'm gonna hurt you 
 What you don't know 
 Ours verse who? 
 Is a virtue 
 Ruff ryders be the team 
 Which means 
 A lot of cream 
 Runin' skeems 
 Stunnin' beams 
 To make y'all stop drop right on the scene 
 This nigga here is to hot 
 And to much 
 For you to touch 
 Betta tell ya man 
 If two touch 
 Then he too will get you bust 
 You bust? 
 We do 
 You can ask people 
 But quitly 
 They don't believe us till they lead violate 
 Is you buyin' this 
 Cause niggaz that purchase 
 Is under the dirt kid 
 They call me drag-on 
 I'm the youngest 
 But get bunka's 
 Callabo wit' my dogz from yonka's 
 Plus these bronx bomba's 
 Spittin' flame to the gutta 
 But ya all get flamed 
 Chorus x2: damion 
 My dogz gon' stop 
 Y'all dogz gon' drop 
 Then we gon' 
 Shut'em down open up shop 
 First we had'em like ooh 
 Now they like nnnooo 
 What baby, that's how ruff ryders roll 
 Verse two: jadakiss 
 When I pop up 
 I lock shop up 
 Pull the drop up 
 Park a block up 
 Hit the alarm put the top up 
 Stash the dro in my sock 
 Then pull my sock up 
 Keep the burner 
 But if it's hot put my glock up 
 You know what I'm about 
 Slidin' off get my cock sucked 
 Writin' rhymes watchin' scarface in the hot tub 
 What you wanna bet 
 When I pull it out 
 If you don't shout 
 Then every bullet will go in and out 
 Who you besides kiss take a piss 
 In a bottle of cryse (crystal) 
 Then give it to a modelin' bitch 
 And you like ya watch plain 
 I'ma flood mine 
 Alligator bloodeline 
 Trade the finest coke 
 And write one time 
 Verse 3: styles 
 Ya niggaz ain't hearin' me out 
 Till I pop up appear in ya house 
 Clearin' it out holiday style 
 Everybody actin' violent and wild 
 Snatch the wife silence the child 
 That's how we move 
 Kill me, my man kill you 
 That's how you lose 
 I ruff ryde 
 I don't like to slide felt that I sliped 
 And the gunz only helpin' the clip 
 And the clips only my hand 
 And like who the fuck is helpin' ya man 
 When I cock back and hop the van 
 Double r 
 Get a jar 
 Play the shit in the car 
 Hit the party start a fight at the bar 
 Snatch ya r (rolex) 
 Sell ya shit for some coke 
 And get the fuck out the dogde 
 Verse four: eve 
 Cats you, figga 
 That my niggaz flippa 
 With the trigger 
 News teams crowd around try to flick a picture 
 Get wit ya, this bitch runnin'it down to ya quicka 
 Nigga not makin' sence 
 Betta stay up off the liquor 
 Blonde bomb shell 
 Karamel, heavy spitta 
 Groupies sayin' I'm they sista 
 Hush ya mouth for I hit ya 
 Sickenin' wise guys and thugs and bullshitta's 
 Take you for a ride cover up ya eyes 
 Then I hit ya 
 Used to be shya now I'm a ruff ryda 
 Fake niggaz play me close 
 When they used to ride by ya 
 Snatchin' up ya figures frontin' know 
 You niggas, hatta's screamin' 
 Who that bitch 
 Mind ya business nigga 
 Verse 5: damion 
 X is gonna hit ya niggaz hard 
 Leave ya niggaz scared 
 Fuckin' wit' the dog 
 When you fuckin' wit' the god 
 Rip that niggaz heart 
 Faggot niggaz saw 
 Remember me from up north 
 I had you scared to cough 
 My name is ringin' bells 
 In penatentary cells 
 I makin' thugs rebell 
 It ain't hard to tell 
 You never really wanted it 
 Saw the mic yo jumped in front of it 
 Out of sixteen I'm gonna hit 
 Which one of you niggaz am I gonna get 
 Thought you knew what I was gonna spit 
 This time, wit' this rhyme 
 By the end of it 
 Ya niggaz is gon' be like yo x riped it 
 Did my thing as usual it's never gon' stop 
 You cats can't be for real I got this shit locked 
 It's not a game or a joke 
 To my name or get smoked 
 Simple as that simple as black 
 To the throught 
 Hit'em all under the coat 
 Now you losen' yo life 
 Rrrrrrrrr a dog is a dog for life.
