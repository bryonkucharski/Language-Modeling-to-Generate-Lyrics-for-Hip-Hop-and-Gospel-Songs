She looks good to me 
 She's got everything I want 
 (She's got everything I need) 
 She looks good! 
 She looks good to me 
 She's got everything I want 
 (Oh Yeah) 
 (She's got everything I need) 
 Every time I look at her eyes 
 I'm knocked out 
 She slides like a river on a rescue fountain 
 Jump on board now 
 Slide up and down 
 Nothing else matters 
 As I hear my heart pounding 
 She looks good to me 
 She's got everything I want, 
 She's got everything I need 
 Yeah she looks good to me 
 Every time I see her I can't bear to breathe 
 She's got everything I want, 
 She's got everything I need 
 (She looks good) 
 She looks good to me 
 She's got everything I want 
 (Oh Yeah) 
 (She's got everything I need) 
 Yeah she looks good to me 
 She's got everything I want, 
 She's got everything I need 
 Yeah she looks good to me 
 She's got everything I want, 
 She's got everything I need 
 Yeah-he-he-ah oh 
 She lays there asleep and I listen to her breathe 
 Sweet in the mouth says that she's with me 
 All I think about is the moments like these 
 And hold her in my arm and make her believe it 
 She looks good to me 
 She's got everything I want 
 She's got everything I need 
 Yeah she looks good to me 
 Every time I see her I can barely breathe 
 I can barely breathe 
 She looks good to me 
 She's got everything I want 
 She's got everything I need 
 Yeah she looks good to me 
 Every time I see her I can barely breathe 
 She looks good to me 
 She's got everything I want 
 She's got everything I need 
 Yeah she looks good to me 
 Every time I see her I can barely breathe
