Looking like you glued to your chair 
 It's a party going on in here 
 Don't you dare leave no stay 
 I just wanna boogie baby 
 Just take your time and ease your mind 
 And Let the rhythm take control 
 You need to get on get on the dance floor 
 'Cause I'm gonna rock yo body baby 
 Lemme rock yo body baby 
 Girl just get on get on the dance floor 
 Just lemme rock yo body baby 
 Ima rock yo body on the dance floor 
 I don't know whos gonna let you see

 And I know you can move yo thang mama 
 And you just where I'll be 
 I just wanna boogie baby (yeah) 
 Just take your time and ease your mind (ease your mind girl) 
 I just wanna mooove 
 Are you looking stop looking 
 Just meet me on the floor

 You know you want some more 
 If you trust me just trust me 
 We'll rock right out the door 
 Girl such a beautiful night started on the dance floor
