 Yo, Eve

 Rasta 
 (Damien Marley (Eve)) 
 Now this one is elementary 
 We going to end it for the century 
 Ruff Ryder evolution presentary 
 Rag-a-muffin play-mentry 
 Yo (Uh, Come On, yo) Bumba

 Uh huh uh, uh huh (yo) uh huh (yo)

 You say that you love me but why could you lie

 (Eve - *rapping*) 
 Yo, yo, yo

 Ruff Ryder Ryde or Die jack bout we

 We, we, we 
 (Damien Marley) 
 Mack to wrist to my girl I love the best 
 But when you left me it's like a bullet to my chest 
 Now I got to say I got a bullet through vest 
 Knocked off my feet I pleaded no contest 
 Sleepless nights without no sleep or rest 
 This is like a muffin jury you got to mix 
 Take it no more and had to make her confess 
 Sometimes I feel I'm in the Wild, Wild West 
 Lost the love I had now I live to the death 
 (Stephen Marley (Damien Marley)) 
 Long as I she caught me lying I get caught for lying 
 If she sure believe then sure believe is the sign 
 But listening to promises what a fool am I 
 Can somebody tell me? You know all his life 
 I'm just trying to be friendly, but I'm losing my mind 
 The news that your moving got me standing outside 
 Use to be rubber ducky late nights no wine 
 Mrs. Lovely Vessel body all mine 
 Girl went to shoot me with the shoot all mind 
 Sweet like a puppy, is so hard to find 
 And I know you don't love me, I'm reading the signs 
 Cause there's no where to go since you left me behind 
 (Now it's TRUE, TRUE) that I loved you for truth 
 (TRUE, TRUE) she stick like ankle glue 
 (TRUE, TRUE) I make your gray skies blue 
 (TRUE, TRUE) you want me pers-nal boo 
 Chilling up on the house our love be that strong 
 DJ's steady playing on the one's and two's
