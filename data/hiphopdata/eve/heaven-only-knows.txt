Heaven only knows 
 Heaven only knows 
 Heaven only knows 
 Heaven only knows 
 (My story) 
 Went from dancin' on table tops 
 To makin' labels pop 
 For tha love of tha money 
 So I could cop everything 
 From icy rings to drop tops 
 Now I'm on top 
 But to look back on my reality 
 Happy I stopped lettin' niggas rule my world 
 Impressed by niggas tryin' to school this baby girl 
 I was fuckin' too early 
 15 knowin' money was green 
 Puffin' too early 
 Body big not grown 
 Knowledged up too early 
 Thought it was cute to flirt with older cats 
 Up in they face 
 Didn't have a daddy so I put a daddy in the space 
 My mommy was my shelter but I broke free 
 Learnin' that the streets was harder 
 Than I thought they'd be 
 Wantin' to be grown- rebellin' 
 Ain't no tellin' where I'd be- pussy sellin' 
 Never would i 
 Instead I wore a g-string 
 Thought never could i 
 Thougth I had to to be grown beginning of my life 
 Heaven only knows (heaven only knows) 
 Heaven only knows (heaven only knows) 
 Ooh 
 Heaven only knows (heaven only knows) 
 Heaven only knows (heaven only knows) 
 Yo closed my self down held myself in 
 Exposed my myself alone no one helpin' 
 What am I to do but cryin' on that night 
 No one in the house knew TV was my life 
 Who was I to tell and what would they think of me 
 No one understood the pain that was sent to me 
 Broke down from the things men would say to me 
 Sellin; dreams to a naive kid- I blame me 
 But I never really had someone to tell me what to do 
 Teach me that I'm better than just pussy that's true 
 Teach me that the future was written already waitin' 
 So respect myself and life not to be consumed with hatin' 
 Do positive and positive would happen 
 Stay positive and positive was rappin' 
 It was like my brain was clouded with unnecessary shit 
 But I chose to see through the negative and make hits 
 Heaven only knows (heaven only knows) 
 Heaven only knows (heaven only knows) 
 Ooh 
 Heaven only knows (heaven only knows) 
 Heaven only knows (heaven only knows) 
 Yo yo now I'm 20 years old and look where I'm at 
 I thank the lord every day and pray there's no turnin' back 
 I wannna keep my family happy and that's that 
 See tears in my mother's eyes from platinum placks 
 See things that I've done I don't regret 
 I just learn from mistakes in the past knowin' that 
 I had to earn respect and earn trust 
 In school was never given 
 The way you find out about life is simply livin' 
 To be strong stay strong let nobody crush you 
 Your body is your temple young girls 
 Don't let him touch you 
 He'll respect anything you say if he really loves you 
 Don't settle for second let him put no one above you 
 I did a lot of things in my life I take back 
 Gotta take from the good and the bad collect that 
 Cause it helps to build who you see now respect that 
 Young black and strong keep me in your tape deck 
 Heaven only knows (heaven only knows) 
 Heaven only knows (heaven only knows) 
 Ooh 
 Heaven only knows (heaven only knows) 
 Heaven only knows (heaven only knows) 
 Heaven only knows (heaven only knows) 
 Ooh 
 (Fade)
