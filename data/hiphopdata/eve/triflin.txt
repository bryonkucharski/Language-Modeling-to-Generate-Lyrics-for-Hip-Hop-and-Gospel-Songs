(Eve) 
 Ice gleam when you walk through 
 Stopped in my tracks, like daddy what I need 
 But I'm a play the back 
 Got a whole lot of chicks want to say they touch your stacks 
 And I see you're playin' Santa Claus 
 Got 'em all on your lap 
 But they givin' you whatever you want 
 Not me though, stallion; ride rough 
 Plus I'm trying to see dough 
 Enough to make you fiend 
 Coko like cane 
 What you need? 
 Challenge make it nothing 
 Let me see if you can handle me 
 (Coko) 
 Sexy, tempting 
 Caught my attention 
 Knew that he had me in a daze 
 Oh, fly ways, teasing me 
 Enchanted, the way he 
 Stopped and stared me in the face 
 (Coko) 
 But as soon he said a word 
 The same old line that I already heard 
 Disappointed me right away 
 'Cause of the things he had to say were... 
 (Coko) 
 Triflin', ghetto 
 Sorry, oh no 
 Tired, gaming 
 That's such a shame 
 Triflin', ghetto 
 Sorry, oh no 
 Fine as hell though 
 And that's so pitiful 
 (Coko) 
 His lips, enticing 
 So inviting 
 Smile could melt your heart away, oh 
 I started to imagine 
 Just what could happen 
 If he should come and talk to me 
 (Coko) 
 But as soon he said a word 
 The same old line that I already heard 
 Disappointed me right away 
 'Cause of the things he had to say were... 
 (Coko) 
 Triflin', ghetto 
 Sorry, oh no 
 Tired, gaming 
 That's such a shame 
 Triflin', ghetto 
 Sorry, oh no 
 Fine as hell though 
 And that's so pitiful 
 (Coko) 
 Oh, I like what I see 
 Oh, shorty come and talk to me 
 Oh, you spoke your first word 
 Oh, I can't believe the shit I heard 
 (Eve) 
 Huh? What you mean you want to touch at my house? 
 You'll never see me bent over my couch 
 Think I'm a chicken; watch me thug it out? 
 Matter of fact, I'm a forget that I met you 
 Now, why you gonna make me get ghetto and disrespect you? 
 Had to be a clown, and I'm a laugh at your silly ass 
 Pass on your petty cash 
 Never should have thought I was weak 
 Can't believe you had the nerve to speak 
 Player, you know who I am? 
 You must of thought I was some type of freak 
 (Coko) 
 Triflin', ghetto 
 Sorry, oh no 
 Tired, gaming 
 That's such a shame 
 Triflin', ghetto 
 Sorry, oh no 
 Fine as hell though 
 And that's so pitiful
