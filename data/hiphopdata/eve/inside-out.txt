I would swallow my pride 
 I would choke on the rhines 
 But the lack thereof would leave me empty inside 
 I would swallow my doubt turn it inside out find nothing but faith in nothing 
 Want to put my tender heart in a blender 
 Watch it spin around to a beautiful oblivion 
 Rendezvous then I'm through with you 
 I burn burn like a wicker cabinet chalk white and oh so frail 
 I see our time had gotten stale 
 The tick tock of the clock is painful 
 All sane and logical 
 I want to tear it off the wall 
 I hear words and clips and phrases 
 I think sick like ginger ale 
 My stomach turns and I exhale 
 So Cal is where my mind states but it's not my state of mind 
 I'm not as ugly sad as you 
 Or am I origami 
 Folded up and just pretend demented as the motives in your head 
 I alone am the one you don't know you need take heed feed your ego 
 Make me blind when your eyes close sink when you get close tie me to the bedpost 
 I alone am the one you don't know you need you don't know you need me. Make me 
 Blind when your eyes close, time me to the bed post
