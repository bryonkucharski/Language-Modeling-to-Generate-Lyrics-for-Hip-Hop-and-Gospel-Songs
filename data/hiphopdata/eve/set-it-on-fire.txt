Set it on fire, fire, fire, fire, fire 
 Uh yeah, if you came to play our game 
 Make me say a lot of things I never face 
 Still tryin' to catch up, chasin' me for days 
 I'll be in the fast lane, you'll be up away 
 What we do we see each other and no play 
 Still got the mask, they break jaws but no face 
 Brand new, think breakin' laws is okay 
 Talkin' shit are only get you blown away 
 So take my advice stay fare, this fame, you'll never want that 
 In and out, no trace like that 
 Know you'll feel the heat your on back, come on 
 Listen, I gets time when the clock is moved next to movin' lights 
 Drownin' at the sounds of the crowd but they're in placed safe 
 Steppin' on the fire, fire, fire till it explode 
 Set it on fire, fire, fire, let it burn, fire, fire, fire 
 Set it on fire, fire, fire, let it burn, fire, fire, fire, fire till it explode 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey yo, hip hop dead and I'm revivin' 
 Contagious flow call poison madman 
 Everybody doing it, Jersey to tight Tee 
 Followin' the transam never excite me 
 Always a leader and the rest to follow 
 Short [Incomprehensible] as well as the bible 
 Maybe are called but few are chosen 
 You know it's will if Eve is spoken 
 You know it's get crazy when the lights go out 
 You better be prepared for different route 
 The heat keeps comin', you better start runnin' 
 The way that they aimin' that thing, you can't stop them 
 You know it's get crazy when the lights go out 
 You better be prepared for different route 
 The heat keeps comin', you better start runnin' 
 The way that they aimin' that thing, you can't stop them 
 Listen, I gets time when the clock is moved next to movin' lights 
 Drownin' at the sounds of the crowd but they're in placed safe 
 Steppin' on the fire, fire, fire till it explode 
 Listen, I gets time when the clock is moved next to movin' lights 
 Drownin' at the sounds of the crowd but they're in placed safe 
 Steppin' on the fire, fire, fire till it explode 
 Set it on fire, fire, fire, let it burn, fire, fire, fire 
 Set it on fire, fire, fire, let it burn, fire, fire, fire 
 Listen, I gets time when the clock is moved next to movin' lights 
 Drownin' at the sounds of the crowd but they're in placed safe 
 Steppin' on the fire, fire, fire till it explode 
 Set it on fire, fire, fire, let it burn, fire, fire, fire
