Now I ain't ever been the type to 
 Not excite ya 
 Can't miss the vixen that meant ya like her 
 Play ya position, just might invite ya 
 Party till the mornin if she like ya 
 I ain't attracted to no lame dudes, 
 Don't wanna name a few 
 Don't lie either so don't ask 
 She might be namin you 
 When I'm allergic to these corny bitches 
 Tryna start shit to end my ? I'm too up on my riches 
 ?Gang? been a part of me, dawg, and I'm'ma keep winnin' 
 Never shoulda started me off 
 I love the way I'm livin' 
 And they wonder why she won't stop 
 Sit around mumblin to myself hopin that my shit flop 
 Now that's the shit I like to laugh at 
 Obsessed with my every move 
 Dummy, find a crash test 
 Every year I'm just a little wiser 
 And yo it's still gon be left in the race? 
 (Ayyo she got it like) 
 (E!) 
 Every day, eatin and takin' it to the 
 (V!) 
 Vixen V-12 with systems 
 (E!) 
 Everybody keepin' it movin 
 It's double R, ???, this is Eve-olution, now scream 
 (E!) 
 If you're really ready we're takin' it to the 
 (V!) 
 Vicious spit flows ridiculous 
 (E!) 
 Say it like you know the letters 
 Bombshell ???? scream my name for me 
 (There's more but I have no more time to sit here and type out lyrics for you 
 Lazy ass so I suggest you get the lyrics to this song so I can have them. Thank 
 You.
