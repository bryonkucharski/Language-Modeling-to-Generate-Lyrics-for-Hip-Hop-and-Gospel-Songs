{Drag-On} 
 I be the D-R-A-G dash ya niggas foot slim 
 'Cause bullets make your feet fast 
 We throw babies in the trash 
 Drag don't play with little gats 
 Crib like McDonalds nuttin but Big Macs 
 And quarter pounds 
 Bitch place your order now stay in line 
 I only fuck with broke niggas 
 That stright depend on crime 
 You straight pussy so fuck your ass cap 
 'Cause in jail they'll put your cap where 
 Your ass at you ass black 
 Projects that's where Drag at 
 Yeah ya got heart 
 But if I don't got my gun 
 That's where ya gonna get stabbed at 
 Boy as a young I never grabbed that toy 
 Drag was taught to grab that and ask 
 "Where the cash at" 
 {Sheek} 
 You think we shoot his pocket sides 
 Deuce decuce and 25's 
 You ain't takin' em' nigga 
 You threatenin' lives 
 I ain't frontin motherfucker 
 I don't shoot no legs 
 I'm tryna see if your brains 
 Really look like eggs 
 Or is it just that commercial 
 Your brain on drugs 
 Now it's a total different look 
 From these shotgun slugs 
 To get rich it could take less than two days 
 I'm like them little beepers 
 Halfs and bullets two-ways 
 Fuck vests my shit go throught toupèès 
 I'ma thug in New York 
 And when I'm on your set 
 We the apartment where they filmed 
 Good times at 
 Bitch what the fuck I'ma thug nigga 
 Chrous:(2X) 
 I'ma thug in da streetz and I know what to do 
 If you fuckin' with me I'ma fuck with you 
 I don't give a fuck now I'm doing my thing 
 Like a motherfucking dog I'm doing my thang 
 {Styles} 
 Weight on my back 
 Hate in my heart 
 Blood in my eye 
 Foot on the gas 
 Blunt in my mouth 
 Lovin' the ride 
 Hand on the gun 
 Ear to the street 
 Back to the wall 
 Mind on my money while I'm clappin at y'all 
 {Jadakiss} 
 I got niggas in jail 
 Crack in the hood 
 Hustle in south 
 Fiends and customers 
 That run in your house 
 I got family ties 
 I'm handy with knives 
 I live my life in the ghetto 
 Nose candy and nines 
 I'm deeper than most 
 Sleep wit it close 
 Wake wit a demon 
 Have visions of the whole 
 World shaking and screaming 
 {Styles} 
 I was born to be a leader 
 But if the game was dirty 
 I was born to be a cheater 
 You talking to me greasy 
 I was going to get the heater 
 {Jadakiss} 
 You tell me what you know about blow 
 Gettin' dough and straight warrin' with a meaner 
 Frontin in a Benz or I was soarin' in a Bima 
 {Styles} 
 Lyin' in the cut 
 The gun is straight running 
 Like a tire on the trucks 
 If he is real or a liar 
 Put the plyer to his nuts 
 Or the fire to his guts 
 {Jadakiss} 
 'Cause niggas is too soft 
 That heat make niggas cool off 
 Fuck ice I'm tryna cop the crew lofts 
 {Styles} 
 So we can be back in effect 
 I throw the barrel to the back of your neck 
 And hop back in the vette (corvette) 
 {Jadakiss} 
 'Cause everybody is a felon with loot 
 'Cause they say rap is like dust 
 {Styles and Jadakiss} 
 And we the only ones sellin' the juice 
 Chrous:(2X) 
 I'ma thug in da streetz and I know what to do 
 If you fuckin' with me I'ma fuck with you 
 I don't give a fuck now I'm doing my thing 
 Like a motherfucking dog I'm doing my thang 
 {Eve} 
 Bitches is so sick 
 They throw up 
 So scared they don't even 
 Come around in places that I show up 
 Go ahead nigga put your dough up 
 Me against who nigga grow up 
 Bitches choke can't even get their flow up 
 I ain't got no fear 'bout you bitches in da industry 
 Actin' all confused don't know who you supposed to be 
 Chickens lost steady worryin' bout 
 Who's dick is tossed 
 Stop stallin betta get this thing before it's gone 
 But I ain't mad 
 'Cause I ain't gon' pass it on 
 Callin' askin can you get on my shit 
 'Cause your cash is gone 
 You won't get no sales off of me 
 Bitch please 
 Pitbull run with dogs 
 I don't like fleas 
 Chrous:(2X) 
 I'ma thug in da streetz and I know what to do 
 If you fuckin' with me I'ma fuck with you 
 I don't give a fuck now I'm doing my thing 
 Like a motherfucking dog I'm doing my thang
