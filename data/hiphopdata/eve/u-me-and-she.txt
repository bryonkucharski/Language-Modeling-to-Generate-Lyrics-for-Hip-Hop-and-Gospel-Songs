I'm sittin' down in da corner 
 Chillin' with all my boys 
 Mr. Biggs is in the house 
 U, me and she 
 What we gonna do 
 Baby, baby? 
 Get at the party, city of Venis 
 I did it to myself, couldn't help the way I felt about him 
 Sick when he wasn't there, like I never dealt without him 
 Played the fool by choice, all I had was this man 
 Let him have the best of both worlds 'cause it was his clan 
 All the things I wanted to hear, he told me gently 
 Whatever it was, wanted nothin', gave me plenty 
 Told me that he split with this chick but couldn't shake her 
 'Cause she had his kids so he fed her with this paper 
 First it started off like that, dough for closure 
 Started slackin' off, in fact it wasn't over 
 Now my world is crumblin' down, I'm feelin' shaky 
 Used to be a superwoman, no bitch could replace me 
 Wanted him to leave me alone but I was caught up 
 Thought I was strong, broke down when breaking up was brought up 
 Tried to really ride with this dude, I thought I loved him 
 And every time I asked what I should do, he said trust him 
 U, me and she 
 What we gonna do 
 Baby? 
 (Trust me) 
 Baby 
 (Hold me, yeah) 
 U, me and she 
 What we gonna do 
 Baby 
 (Believe me) 
 Baby 
 (Need me, yeah) 
 To hate, I must be crazy, feeding him the bullshit 
 Attitudes and tryin' to hold out that shit was useless 
 The more I tried to back up, the more he kept comin' 
 Lie after lie, shit, lying wasn't nothin' 
 Tear after tear come down, tellin' me to be cool 
 All I need is you, baby, nobody could be you 
 Believed him, he deceived me just to keep me 
 Callin' me from her spots sayin' how he need me 
 I had to step back, he got me stressed out 
 This ain't what I planned, thought I had my life sketched out 
 Huh, I guess not, love me to hurt me 
 Hurt me to make-up, then make-up to desert me 
 U, me and she 
 What we gonna do 
 Baby? 
 (Trust me) 
 Baby 
 (Hold me, yeah) 
 U, me and she 
 What we gonna do 
 Baby 
 (Believe me) 
 Baby 
 (Need me, yeah) 
 Back and forth with the he said, he said got me dizzy 
 If I leave, know the routine, he beg 'cause he miss me 
 Too late, 'cause you had me, lost me, daddy, move on 
 Boss-bitch, no more floss, nigga, I'm gone 
 Arguments for hours, me and her comparing notes and 
 After all the screamin' stop, we comparing quotes 
 You got sloppy thoughts, you was that nigga let me catch you 
 Heart didn't hurt till I covered up your tattoo 
 My statue on a pedestal, every breath too 
 Never knew the worst till you felt what the best do 
 And I'm that, it's over now, hope I stressed you 
 But Niggas only do it when you lie, when I let you
