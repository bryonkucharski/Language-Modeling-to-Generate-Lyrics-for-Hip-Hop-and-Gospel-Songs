Uh Yeah 
 U know them nights when you looking good 
 When it all come together sexy head to toe like you know you should 
 Body banging got they tongues hanging 
 Got 'em lined up wanting your atttention 
 But you like to keep 'em waiting 
 Riding through they screaming sexy 
 But you keep it movin constantly smiling at 'em come and get me 
 Alot of dudes ain't got the courage 
 So till they get it up live it up mami that don't keep you worried 
 Attention something that you get 
 Not something that you need 
 Unless you spot the dude that makes you weak (then) 
 If that's the case gotta let it flow 
 Get close to 'em let 'em in yo ear this is what you hear 
 Chorus: Robin Thicke 
 All I want is you only u

 Girl you know that I wanna do things to u 
 Nobody else gets to do

 Girl you know that I wanna make it come true

 Yuh My body your body touching and sweating 
 Kissing and tugging

 Love it when it's perfect tell me what you want 
 Eyes met mine and it was on 
 Wanted to take me home 
 Told me that you wanna make me moan 
 I was up for it already 
 Just to let you take charge 
 I was feeling kinda freaky 
 And I'm knowing you the cause 
 Told me just to lay back 
 Relax close my eyes it'll be all right

 Guess I was yo plan for the night 
 Guess wat ima let you be my man for the night
