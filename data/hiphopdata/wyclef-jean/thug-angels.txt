Refugees yo.. all you say 
 Dirty dirty dirty south 
 I used to play while at the YMCA, in L.A. 
 Sold my first AK 
 I saw her man get murdered on Sunday, bloody Sunday 
 (What about Texas?) They need to chill with the gun play 
 (New York city y'all) Police are at the door 
 The Magnum was by the ashtray 
 (Look at shorty y'all) He 'bout to go out like Scarface 
 He woke up in a cardboard box with no space 
 With Thug Angels singin', sayin' 
 (Huh, huh, hu-huuh 
 Uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh 
 Huh, huh, hu-huuh) 
 So you wanna be a thug? 
 To all my thugs in Houston 
 You wan' push drugs? 
 To all my thugs in Memphis 
 You want the cars in the videos? 
 To the Jacksonville Thug Angels 
 Let me tell you how it really goes 
 I'm on the highway with a black bandana, headed to Atlanta 
 Until I heard woop woop, that sound of da police, should I pull over? 
 He had the dark shades on, but he ain't look like Stevie Wonder 
 His face was, pale and long - he looked like a cold day in December 
 Now let me ask the truth or somethin' 
 should I slow down and be a good camper? 
 I heard a young thug scream 
 "It depends what you got in the beamer" 
 Now I got two choices I could blast and become most wanted in America 
 Or I could slow down like the man in the Bronco 
 and get Johnnie Cochran to be my lawyer 
 Ohh Sonya, hit her on the Motorola 
 If I get locked up I ain't getting out 'til Tuesday 
 'Cause this is Saturday, and it's a holiday 
 Now I got to spend a weekend in the south in jail 
 But you told me that crime paid 
 The dirty dirty dirty south 
 I used to play while at the YMCA, in L.A. 
 Sold my first AK 
 I saw her man get murdered on Sunday, bloody Sunday 
 (What about Brooklyn?) They need to chill with the gun play 
 (Hey) Police are at the door 
 The Magnum was by the ashtray 
 (New Jersey) He 'bout to go out like Scarface 
 He woke up in a cardboard box with no space 
 With Thug Angels singin', sayin' 
 (Huh, huh, hu-huuh 
 Uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh 
 Huh, huh, hu-huuh) 
 So you wanna be a thug? 
 My thugs in Chicago 
 You wan' push drugs? 
 My thugs in Orlando 
 Tou want the cars in the videos? 
 To V-A and D.C., St. Louis, Miami... 
 So you a killer, how many people did you kill? 
 You a dealer, how many drugs did you deal-a? 
 For'reall-a, used to sell crack on the hill-a 
 Yeah right, my name is Elvis and your wife is Priscilla 
 You're an actor, you need a part in this thrilla 
 Hold up, ain't no need to bust your four-fiff-a 
 There's two of us, one of us is bound to leave here in a coma 
 So say your prayers, and give my regards to the undertaker

 Watch out, for the beasts 
 Watch out, if you got a seed, homie 
 'Cause you don't want your kids growin' up 
 Thinkin' they never had no daddy 
 Big Pun, rest in peace forever 
 Bronx, pour some liquor, haaa 
 Slang Tom, rest in peace 
 To the outsiders, pour some liquor, haaa 
 (Let's go) 
 Police is in the news, watch yourself 
 Y'all saw what they did to Diallo 
 Hey, no pushin' 
 Back up, back up, back up, back up 
 (Get your hands out my pocket) 
 Y'all know, like I said on my last album 
 The record's not over yet 
 Back up, back up, back up 
 (You nigga, you betta turn music down, I call 911) 
 You gon' do what? 
 Woy! Yo, turn up your musics louder 
 Woy! All my people in the system Jeep 
 Woy! All my people goin' to school early in the mornin' 
 Woy! All my people in the college doors, talk to them 
 (Haitian singing to end)
