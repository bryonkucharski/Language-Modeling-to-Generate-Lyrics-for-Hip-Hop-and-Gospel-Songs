(Wy-Clef Jean) 
 We got the Refugees All-Stars rubba dubbin' in the club 
 Wyclef Jean, John Forte, Prizewell. 
 Nah mean the streets are gettin' a little crazy... 
 Looka looka looka looka looka 
 Looka looka looka here looka shorty got back 
 Should I ask her for a dance hold on there's too many in a wolf pack 
 And besides Dirtycash talkin' to her 
 Buyin' her fake furs and takin' her to the fever 
 Quite as his kept that ain't even his Benz 
 She spends his franklins at the malls with her friends 
 Material girl, livin' in a material world 
 But it's all right cause its Saturday night 
 So mista funkmaster pump the Bee-Gees 
 And all you college students bring your ouijas' 
 Check the spellin, R E--F U G E--E get the CD from Sam Goody he he 
 You ain't even close wit the rhymes that you wrote 
 Don't be mad cause you broke 
 Let me clear my throat ah huh ah huh 
 John Forte grab the mic roots sway it this way 
 (John Forte) 
 I more than just a rhymer you still a small timer 
 Hopin that the game treat that ass a little kinda 
 Every step tango'd 
 Your beat don't concern me 
 I'm eatin mangos in Trinadad wit attorneys (oh yeah) 
 My crews slang flow worldwide like a current 
 Wit da every spot where nobody get insurance 
 Brotha do the math you ain't half near exotic 
 My man's claim true - you - forget about it 
 Pope hoe just a new stance like my influence 
 Well recognize you a lie tryin' do it 
 Got juice told your lady oops 
 We nuts baby 
 Smooth and charizmatic automatic 
 You gonna save me 
 Godbless the day that my sons survive 
 We strive to teach the youth baby and stay alive 
 (Wy-Clef) 
 Refugee camp 
 Nuts baby

 Yo watch your lady

 Yo if you got more than 
 Dollar in your pocket right now put your hands up 
 (Prizewell (Dirtycash)) 
 Yo yo 
 You can tell by the way I roll shorty that I'm a ladies man 
 A business man 
 Condos down the shore 
 Multi million pension plans 
 But it ain't in my plan to make move without the fam 
 I keep it intact 
 You Clef do the track 
 John play da mack while I pay the tax 
 Business as usuall 
 Watchin suspects 
 Steal my assetts 
 Get cut with gillettes 
 We built this concept 
 Connect like nynex 
 Drinks at the bar 
 My American express 
 (Wy-Clef) 
 Yo I cook up cook up 
 The cop a pull up pull up 
 Then I cuff up cuff up 
 You whos callin bluff 
 Now you shook up shook up 
 Cause you lock up lock up 
 When I love up love up 
 You who's callin bluff 
 (Wy-Clef) 
 Hey yo John is chillin'
