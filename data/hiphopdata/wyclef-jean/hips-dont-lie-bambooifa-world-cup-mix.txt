Ladies up in here tonight 
 No fighting 
 (We got the refugees up in here) 
 No fighting 
 No fighting 
 Shakira, Shakira 
 I never really knew that she could dance like this 
 She make a man want to speak Spanish 
 Como se llama? Bonita, mi casa, su casa 
 (Shakira, Shakira) 
 Oh baby when you talk like that 
 You make a woman go mad 
 So be wise and keep on 
 Reading the signs of my body 
 And I'm on tonight 
 You know my hips don't lie 
 And I'm starting to feel it's right 
 All the attraction, the tension 
 Don't you see baby, this is perfection 
 Hey girl, I can see your body moving 
 And it's driving me crazy 
 And I didn't have the slightest idea 
 Until I saw you dancing 
 And when you walk up on the dance floor 
 Nobody cannot ignore the way you move your body, girl 
 And everything's so unexpected, the way you right and left it 
 So you can keep on taking it 
 I never really knew that she could dance like this 
 She make a man want to speak Spanish 
 Como se llama? Bonita, mi casa, su casa 
 (Shakira, Shakira) 
 Oh baby when you talk like that 
 You make a woman go mad 
 So be wise and keep on 
 Reading the signs of my body 
 I'm on tonight 
 You know my hips don't lie 
 And I'm starting to feel you boy 
 Come on let's go, real slow 
 Don't you see baby asi es perfecto 
 I know I'm on tonight my hips don't lie 
 And I'm starting to feel it's right 
 All the attraction, the tension 
 Don't you see baby, this is perfection 
 (Shakira, Shakira) 
 Oh boy, I can see your body moving 
 Half animal, half man 
 I don't, don't really know what I'm doing 
 But you seem to have a plan 
 My will and self-restraint 
 Have come to fail now, fail now 
 See, I'm doing what I can, but I can't so you know 
 That's a bit too hard to explain 
 Baila en la calle de noche 
 Baila en la calle de día 
 Baila en la calle de noche 
 Baila en la calle de día 
 I never really knew that she could dance like this 
 She make a man want to speak Spanish 
 Como se llama? Bonita, mi casa, su casa 
 (Shakira, Shakira) 
 Oh baby when you talk like that 
 You know you got me hypnotized 
 So be wise and keep on 
 Reading the signs of my body 
 Señorita, feel the conga 
 Let me see you move like you come from Colombia 
 Mira en Barranquilla se baila asi, say it! 
 Mira en Barranquilla se baila asi 
 Yeah, she's so sexy, every man's fantasy 
 A refugee like me back with the Fugees from a 3rd world country 
 I go back like when 'Pac carried crates 
 For Humpty Humpty we need a whole club dizzy 
 Why the CIA wanna watch us? 
 Colombians and Haitians 
 I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction 
 (Incomprehensible) 
 No more do we snatch ropes 
 Refugees run the seas 'cause we own our own boats 
 I'm on tonight, my hips don't lie 
 And I'm starting to feel you boy 
 Come on let's go, real slow 
 Baby, like this is perfecto 
 Oh, you know I'm on tonight and my hips don't lie 
 And I'm starting to feel it's right 
 The attraction, the tension 
 Baby, like this is perfection 
 No fighting
