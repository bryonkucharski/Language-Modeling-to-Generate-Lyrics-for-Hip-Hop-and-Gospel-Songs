Refugee camp 
 Turn me up give me some more 
 Tom Jones your ready baby 
 Yeah that's it 
 Let go 
 One, two toms coming for you 
 Three, four gonna bust through your door 
 Five, six you better lock up your chicks 
 Seven, eight before its to late 
 Act right ladies seem forgot body 
 Feels like pussycats come out 
 Late night no matter where they roam 
 They always gonna come home to Tom Jones 
 Thirty years strong never went wrong 
 Still in the game I decide when I'm gone 
 Now I'm gonna set the whole house on fire 
 I won't stop rocking till I retire 
 You know and I know you gotta move on the dance floor 
 Were blowing up this party with this sex bomb 
 Take my hand understand I'll rock for years all across the land 
 So let me see you shake it till the sun comes 
 Now you're in the mood 
 So let me see you move 
 I got you hypnotized with the sound of the groove 
 From London to L.A. 
 And back to the N.Y. 
 Turn on your satellites so we can see it worldwide 
 You know and I know you gotta move on the dance floor 
 Were blowing up this party with this sex bomb 
 Take my hand understand I'll rock for years all across the land 
 So let me see you shake it till the sun comes 
 Pussycats come out late night 
 Girl you make me want to holler 
 Tom Jones international baby (3*) 
 Tom Jones, oh oh oh oh oh, Tom Jones (2*)
