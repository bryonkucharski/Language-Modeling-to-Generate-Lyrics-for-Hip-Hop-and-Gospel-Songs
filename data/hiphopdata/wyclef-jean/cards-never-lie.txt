The cards never lie, my last breath a sigh 
 And now I think about if it's my time to die 
 I don't know what I was thinking, steady wasting time with Hill 
 And I need to live my life because my time is unforgivable 
 I can't understand how my life changed around 
 Manifest my destiny, is it the brown on the grown? 
 Blue skies are turning gray it's the point of indecision 
 Leaving in the car and much be spent on television 
 Oh girlfriend, get your mind on right 
 Don't spend your time 'cause you can't waste your time 
 Everyday like it's your last but you must feed the mind 
 Intervention comes and snatch up all your dreams from behind 
 Love, you feel it and you got to let them know it 
 Love, your heart and that's the feeling that you go with 
 If you have a dream you need to go and let them know it 
 'Cause you could wake up in the morning and it could be over 
 No, no, no, no 
 I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna go 
 Just, just, just let me stay home 
 Let me live my dream, let me see another dawn 
 No, no, no, no 
 I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna go 
 Just, just, just let me stay home 
 Let me live my dream, let me see another dawn 
 Carmen, don't listen 'cause the cards have deceit 
 Just slide him the money, we don't need a receipt 
 Truth only exists within the eyes of the beholder 
 Plus he's kind of young for fortune telling 
 He probably should be older 
 But the cards never lie, I thought I told you 
 Now it's her turn to try, to reach her goals 
 Before she reaches the light 
 This is love 
 It's like I'm trying to throw my life away 
 Sometimes love is all you got 
 And other times it makes you pay 
 Well, when you finally rise 
 Then you'll realize 
 The windows to the soul are not the hips but the eyes 
 Oh you could wish on the stars but they dead, just a lie 
 But they shine just as bright as they did their entire life 
 No, no, no, no 
 I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna go 
 Just, just, just let me stay home 
 Let me live my dream, let me see another dawn 
 No, no, no, no 
 I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna go 
 Just, just, just let me stay home 
 Let me live my dream, let me see another dawn
