 Ladies and gentleman, 
 The world music ambassador Wyclef Jean's in the house 
 Alongside of sexy Lucia 
 Jan, let it go 
 Let it go 
 Let it go 
 Let it go 
 Let it go 
 Let it go 
 Let it go 
 Let it go 
 Let it go 
 I'm told, I was partying with the Russians in a yacht 
 Ass bigger than a hat and saw a girl 
 Asked her where's she's from 
 That's when she replied, "You're a bi!" 
 I'm drunk, got it going dippy-dong-dong 
 And the way she move her body, now I'm dippy-dong-dong 
 She hide like the sun, got me dippy-dong-dong 
 Murder She Wrote, what a bomb-bomb! 
 (Women sing) If you look into my eyes you can see my cheri amour 
 (Wyclef) I want it 
 (Women sing) Does it feel like a dischevel? when I tell you that I want you 
 (Wyclef) Yes it do 
 (Women sing) Would you be my lover now, and tempt me off from danger 
 (Wyclef) I'd love to 
 So let's dance on a dial, the party no style 
 When you party on a yacht, you don't worry about cops 
 They can shut us down 
 They can shut us down 
 They can shut us 
 They can shut us 
 They can shut us down 
 I'm told, I was partying with the Russians in a yacht 
 Ass bigger than a hat and saw a girl 
 Asked her where's she's from 
 That's when she replied, "You're a bi?" 
 I'm drunk, got it going dippy-dong-dong 
 The way she move her body, now I'm dippy-dong-dong 
 She hide like the sun, got me dippy-dong-dong 
 Murder She Wrote, what a bomb-bomb! 
 (Women sing) If you look me in the morning and you hit me lights, I make love 
 (Wyclef) I'd love to 
 (Women sing) I can feel that you were sent to me from up above, my love 
 (Wyclef) I want you 
 'Cause when I look into your eyes, you're so god-divine. 
 Tiki-tiki-taka, you got me, hear my thighs 
 So let's dance on a dial, the party don't style 
 When you party on a yacht, you don't worry about cops
