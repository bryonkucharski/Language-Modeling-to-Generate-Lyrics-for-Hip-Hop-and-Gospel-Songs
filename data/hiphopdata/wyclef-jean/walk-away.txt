Yo, I'm happy to be in the South 
 To set off my tour in the countryside 
 But who better to set it off for me 
 Than this man right here 
 Yo, this Kenny Rogers chillin' on the 
 Country side with men like Wyclef 
 (Uh, huh) 
 Jerry Wonder 
 (Uh, huh) 
 Big Jack 
 (Mm, hmm) 
 Big Beast 
 (Mm, hmm) 
 And we gon' do something like this for you 
 You got to know when to hold 'em 
 (Yeah, yeah) 
 Know when to fold 'em 
 (DJ's, DJ's) 
 Know when to walk away 
 (Hip hop, hip hop) 
 Know when to run 
 (Yeah, yeah) 
 You got to count your dub-plates 
 (Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto) 
 Before you touch the turntables 
 (All hoods) 
 'Cause if you run out of big tunes 
 That means your sound is done 
 (Y'all ready?) 
 You got to know when to hold 'em 
 Know when to fold 'em 
 (Soundbwoys) 
 Know when to walk away 
 Know when to run 
 (Hey, hey, hey, hey) 
 You got to count your dub-plates 
 Before you touch the turntables 
 (DJ's) 
 'Cause if you run out of big tunes 
 That means your sound is done 
 Get the hell up, 'Clef said, get the hell up 
 Now throw your hands in the sky 
 (Bo, bo, bo, bo) 
 Brooklyn in the back shootin' craps, y'all, whassup? 
 Ladies lookin' hot and pretty 
 Doin' your thing in the club high saditty 
 Worldwide, the gritty committee pity the fool that 
 Act shitty in the midst of the calm, the witty 
 (You got to know when to hold 'em) 
 Y'all know the name 
 Same assassin from before but the beat just changed a little 
 [Unverified] who flip flows 
 That got women in they thongs gettin' on but not Sisqo 
 Select your squad team and your itch 
 Bey know my flow muy caliente, fuego 
 No disrespect to soundbwoy but you better step away from me 
 Easily defeat Measley MC's and tease you 
 Ease back squeeze two in your wig and breeze through 
 You got to know when to hold 'em 
 Know when to fold 'em 
 (Soundbwoys) 
 Know when to walk away 
 Know when to run 
 (Hey, hey, hey, hey) 
 You got to count your dub-plates 
 Before you touch the turntables 
 (DJ's) 
 'Cause if you run out of big tunes 
 That means your sound is done 
 C'mon, c'mon 
 (Get the hell up) 
 Soundbwoys 
 ('Clef said, get the hell up) 
 (Now throw your hands in the sky) 
 Yo, this combination gon' bust from Brooklyn to Shanghai 
 Feel the boogie, boogie Henny got me tipsy, tipsy 
 Kenny Rogers and Pharoahe Monch? No way, this can't be 
 48 tracks, country meets rap 
 Put this on full blast, I'm about to break all formats 
 My destiny is to lead while y'all follow 
 This is Showtime and I'm Live at the Apollo 
 You got to know when to hold 'em 
 (Soundbwoys) 
 Know when to fold 'em 
 (Emcees) 
 Know when to walk away 
 (Yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 Know when to run 
 You got to count your dub-plates 
 Before you touch the turntables 
 (DJ's) 
 'Cause if you run out of big tunes 
 That means your sound is done
