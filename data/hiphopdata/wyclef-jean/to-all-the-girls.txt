Yo, Wyclef, It's time that I confess (Refugee Camp) to all the girls 
 (Don't do it, don't do it) 
 *Singing* To all the girls I loved before 
 *Rapping* To all the girls I cheated on before 
 *Singing* To all the girls I loved before 
 To all the girls I cheated on before, I tip my hat like Willie Nelson 
 You got pressure, take a sip of this Molson 
 Here's what happened, it wasn't my intentions 
 To fall into seduction while playing a temptation 
 I thought I had it figured out, but games don't last 
 The hourglass ran out, I got sprayed with the tear gas 
 Big men don't cry, hold my feelings inside 
 Stress brings me ?, I gotta hold my pride 
 When I see you with another guy, jealous thoughts of homicide 
 Call me selfish when I say Abraham has many wives 
 You say this is the 90's, either it's gonna be me or her 
 I found myself in a blur 
 Lookin' into the clouds thinkin' out loud 
 "I'm in love with two women, who is it gonna be now?" 
 To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year 
 I got a new change of gear, I swear 
 I can see clear now the clouds disappeared 
 You forgive but never forget, so the past reappears, uh huh 
 To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year 
 I got a new change of gear, I swear 
 I can see clear now the clouds disappeared 
 You forgive, but you still think that I'm a ho 
 Second verse is gonna hurt, based on a true life story 
 I got married at 24 in New Jersey 
 You know the feelings start nature take it's course 
 Two years later 'Clef gets a divorce 
 When I had the cold feet, I shouldn't've walked the altar 
 With Dionne Warwick, she could predict my future 
 Went with my feelings even though it wasn't right 
 Creepin' with my secret lover in the middle of the night 
 Back home, break of dawn, dinner's at the table 
 Thin Line Between Love And Hate is on cable 
 I'm lookin' at myself thinkin' out loud 
 "I'm in love with two women, who is it gonna be now?" 
 Break: (includes elements from Rapper's Delight) 
 Hotel, (I'm not a) motel, Holiday Inn (you don't believe me though) 
 And if your girl acts up at the carnival, then you take her friend 
 Hotel, (I'm not a) motel, Holiday Inn (you don't believe me though) 
 And if your girl acts up at the carnival, then you snatch her friend 
 Break it down right here 
 One love, you're lucky to have one love 
 It sounds bugged, drinking wine from the same jug 
 One heart, one mind, one soul 
 She ain't a gold digger, she don't care about your bank-roll 
 Keep your money, she make her own cheddar 
 All she want from me is respect like Aretha 
 Cooked me lasagne, stayed in for the winter 
 Chilled to the summer, now I'm gone till November 
 Have you seen her? 
 I think I did 
 But what I did wrong was take a love for granted 
 Cause first comes trust, don't rush into lust 
 Easier said than done, I lust and I must 
 Passion is a must, but then we start to cuss 
 We was just makin' love, now we tearing up each other's guts 
 Like species, she called me an animal 
 So feel the tongue of the warm-blooded mammal 
 I'm not a ho (repeat and dimminuendo at the same time) 
 (You don't believe me though) 
 I know you're diggin' this 
 Is it OK if I play my guitar right about now, is it all right? 
 (You don't believe me though) 
 All right (you don't believe me though), all right 
 People in the back, is it OK if I play my guitar right about now? 
 All right, all right, all right, all right 
 People on the side, is it OK if I play my guitar right about now?
