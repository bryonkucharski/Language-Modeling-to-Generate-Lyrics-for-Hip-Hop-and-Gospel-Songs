 [Benzino]: 
 I wake up every mornin nigga get up 
 I grab my tech just in case I gotta tear up 
 I said that same shit about ten years ago 
 Same nigga but now my tech is by my window 
 Been reppin threes wearin black 
 Since the days of block parties hollow tips and stolen Cadillacs 
 Been dodgin guns every other fuckin' day 
 Moms can't understand {what's come over it} 
 Runnin' up the weed spots everybody lay the say 
 Everybody gone up in your parkin 
 Gun shot to your boy where your wallet 
 Mr. Benzino kill a man just for profit 
 [m3]: 
 Yo it's the city of the grime 
 And I stay with my nine 
 Slangin and bangin' with Boston niggas that rap Hangmen 
 So when you talk Bean town call me out 
 And end up with a small fuckin' glock in your mouth 
 Niggas

 We never shuvin niggas we try to hug you niggas 
 It's the love it's the love 
 We never shuvin niggas we try to hug you niggas

 [m3]: 
 It's the usual suspect 
 When it's better suitin with the tech 
 'Cause I'm known to keep one on deck 
 I checks niggas sometime I have to correct niggas 
 Sometimes it nothin' at all just disrespect niggas 
 I can't stand a snitch lovin' niggas that ain't a bitch 
 No nigga hatin' 'cause I'm tryin' to get rich 
 Money don't make me a man 
 Whether I'm paid or I'm broke 
 I'm gon still be Mr. Mic meaner from outta town 
 With a clientel like hell 
 'Cause I'm a hustler that raise sin in these streets 
 That I ain't sold and I that can't sell 
 Plus I'm gifted to be connected 
 I get a turno cause someone to turn on after I whips it 
 'Cause I'm a dealer boy clothes at the tailor boy 
 This ain't no gimmick little nigga this is the real McCoy 
 Despite the masses in the gloves they're still thugs 
 I'm still in these streets so I'm a home town and a most loved 
 Boston, Mass keep it thug with niggas 
 We never shuvin niggas we try to hug you niggas 
 It's the love it's the love 
 We never shuvin niggas we try to hug you niggas 
 'Cause it's the love my niggas

 [Wyclef Jean]: 
 Yo I got a call from Ray Benzino he sent me from Imadapan 
 They greeted me with two kisses you know I'm a Made Man 
 How ya think I got the name Hatician Sicillian 
 After I do the prom I change colors like a chamelleon 
 Now understand this refugee got plans to better the land 
 So when the revolution come I keep my gun in hand 
 And that's the truth Wyclef will put two in your goose 
 And use your head like the hunters do to a moose 
 It's the L it's the O it's the V it's the E 
 From the see double O from the L G double E 
 Still crush numb in the E three double O 
 Pedal to the floor before you can say go 
 Ay yo I'm a say this one time stay off my dick 
 You're not in my league so sit Boo Boo sit 
 Let geezie you spit all lines legit 
 Scientists got the formula to come cop the hit 
 Boston, Mass keep it thug with niggas 
 We never shuvin niggas we try to hug you niggas 
 It's the love it's the love 
 We never shuvin niggas we try to hug you niggas

 It's the love...
