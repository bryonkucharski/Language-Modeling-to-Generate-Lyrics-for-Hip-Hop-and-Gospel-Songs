I asked my mother why do you cry 
 She said your brother had... he just died 
 Well I told him not to go outside 
 He said he had to fight for his country's right 
 But don't you know that mo-mother 
 Don't you know that we can't stop the violence, no 
 Because the war is not over 
 Until you can feel love, peace, and hear silence 
 But I smell gunpowder (pow) 
 My brother's been dead ever since 
 I didn't believe it, but when I saw him I was convinced 
 Two shots to the head he was already dead Lord, 
 I headed for revenge in the city of Port Au Prince 
 Screaming bro-brother 
 Don't you know that we can't stop the violence, no 
 Because the war is not over 
 Until you can feel love, peace, and hear silence 
 But I smell gunpowder (Pow) 
 Zion's gunpowder (pow) 
 L.A.'s gunpowder (pow) 
 I wanna know why 
 Christians pray for a new day 
 We don't need no, we don't need no, we don't need no 
 But its still the same way 
 I wanna know why 
 Ghetto people pray for a new day 
 Hey, hey, heeey 
 And its still the same way 
 But the preacher man told me 
 Good things come to those who wait 
 Do good things come to those who wait? 
 I wanna know tell me 
 Good things come to those who wait 
 Do good things come to those who wait? 
 We wanna know, we wanna know, we wanna know (pause) 
 Pe-people 
 Don't you know that we can't stop the violence, no 
 Because the war is not over 
 Until you can feel love, peace, and hear the silence 
 But I smell gunpowder (gunpowder) 
 Brooklyn's gunpowder (gunpowder) 
 Shaolin's gunpowder (gunpowder) 
 Uptown's gunpowder (gunpowder) 
 Jersey's gunpowder (gunpowder) 
 Even New Zealand's gunpowder (gunpowder) 
 Australia's gunpowder (gunpowder) 
 Brixton's gunpowder (gunpowder) 
 Even New Haven's gunpowder
