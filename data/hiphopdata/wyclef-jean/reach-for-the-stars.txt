Reach for the stars 
 First you got to have a vision 
 Reach for the highest 
 If you could see it, you could be it 
 And I know you can get there 
 One day yeah yeah, one day yeah yeah 
 Reach for the stars 
 First you got to have a vision 
 Reach for the highest 
 If you could see it, you could be it 
 And I know you can get there 
 One day yeah yeah, one day yeah yeah 
 When the sun sets, the moon shines 
 Her Instagram pics stop time 
 Now scatter, runnin' down the aisles 
 And she keep the payment short 
 And while she lookin' at her stomach in the mirror 
 She ain't like the way, she look so, she got a tummy tuck for the summer 
 And as ironical, Veronica we all wanted a piece of her 
 She used to roam the block and I'd do anything to get to her 
 'Cause hip-hop got the toll on me 
 And still one time killing me softly 
 But welcome to the school where everybody keep a sawed off 
 And dude took his own life 
 He didn't wanna get bullied no more 
 Young world you gotta be strong 
 Just when you wanna give up that's when a story's born 
 Reach for the stars 
 First you got to have a vision 
 Reach for the highest 
 If you could see it, you could be it 
 And I know you can get there 
 One day yeah yeah, one day yeah yeah 
 Reach for the stars 
 First you got to have a vision 
 Reach for the highest 
 If you could see it, you could be it 
 And I know you can get there 
 One day yeah yeah, one day yeah yeah 
 My brothers was the greatest debaters, they used to debate philosophy 
 Ever since Obama won we been having a tea party 
 And now Mr. Jackson found where my daughter's signing her ABC's 
 And now I'm sippin' wine in the house thinking of Remy 
 Teenage love, look at them whole heads 
 They're from the school of rock, battle of the bands 
 So if you're ever down, listen to this song 
 You don't want 'em singing about a star is born 
 Reach for the stars 
 First you got to have a vision 
 Reach for the highest 
 If you could see it, you could be it 
 And I know you can get there 
 One day yeah yeah, one day yeah yeah 
 Reach for the stars 
 First you got to have a vision 
 Reach for the highest 
 If you could see it, you could be it 
 And I know you can get there 
 One day yeah yeah, one day yeah yeah 
 I know 
 I know oh oh oh 
 I know 
 I know oh oh oh 
 I know 
 Reach for the stars! 
 I know oh oh oh 
 All right 
 I know 
 Reach for the stars! 
 I know 
 I know oh oh oh
