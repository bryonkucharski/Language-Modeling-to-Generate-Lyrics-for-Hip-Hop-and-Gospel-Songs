This is the life 
 This is the life of a night walker 
 Hey girl, the party's on the floor 
 What you doin' in the back of the club smokin' bud? 
 Hey girl, she said, "I owe my pimp money 
 If I don't pay him tonight, then it's gonna get ugly" 
 Hey girl, she said, "There is no excuse 
 This is the life of a prostitute" 
 From the club to your ride, straight to the telly 
 To make money, money, make money, money, money 
 There she goes again the [Incomprehensible] Ethiopian 
 See her walkin' by, but I can't believe what happened 
 She jumpin' in a car with a stranger she don't know 
 Movin' at night time, whatever it takes to get the dough 
 Hey girl, I hope you listen to this song 
 I know you feel like your daddy did you wrong 
 But only you can boot your destiny 
 She said, "Thanks for the advice but I got to make my money" 
 Hey girl, the party's on the floor 
 What you doin' in the back of the club smokin' bud? 
 Hey girl, she said, "I owe my pimp money 
 If I don't pay him tonight, then it's gonna get ugly" 
 Hey girl, she said, "There is no excuse 
 This is the life of a prostitute" 
 From the club to your ride, straight to the telly 
 To make money, money, make money, money, money 
 So hey girl, I can see it all in ya eye 
 Everythin' you cry is wholesome in your life 
 How many men you done let between your thighs? 
 Listen ma, there ain't no surprise 
 You're a street walker, slick talker 
 The face of an hour, the terrible night 
 And do anythin' just to survive 
 When you make fun at me, I'm tryin' to stay alive 
 Hey girl, the party's on the floor 
 What you doin' in the back of the club smokin' bud? 
 Hey girl, she said, "I owe my pimp money 
 If I don't pay him tonight, then it's gonna get ugly" 
 Hey girl, she said, "There is no excuse 
 This is the life of a prostitute" 
 From the club to your ride, straight to the telly 
 To make money, money, make money, money, money 
 This one goes out for 
 Diamonds, China, Phoenix, Belinda 
 Delicious, Star, Mercedes, peaches 
 Vanilla, cocoa, cinnamon, icky 
 Ebony, oh I can't forget India 
 Ecstasy, sparkle, fantasia, Francis 
 Sunshine, Vanessa, precious 
 Haitian Madonna, you're so precious girl 
 Don't let yourself go dirty 
 Hey girl, the party's on the floor 
 What you doin' in the back of the club smokin' bud? 
 Hey girl, she said, "I owe my pimp money 
 If I don't pay him tonight, then it's gonna get ugly" 
 Hey girl, she said, "There is no excuse 
 This is the life of a prostitute" 
 From the club to your ride, straight to the telly 
 To make money, money, make money, money, money
