Yo Serj, pass me that lighter 
 Yeah... yeah, yeah! 
 Flowers, smiling through the battlefield! 
 The break is over man, I'm back with the ink pen 
 Like Ali Bomaye okay I'm on my second wind 
 Used to roll dice when the luck was on my side, man 
 Four-five-six, walked away with a grand man 
 Seen many blocks turn to The Twilight Zone 
 D.A. on the case like Sherlock Holmes 
 My old high school sweetheart started sniffin' a bone 
 For the right bag she deep throat, deeper than a baritone 
 I caught you off guard, this verse is unexpected, check it 
 Like when I rhymed on Big Pun's record, check it 
 I got a swagger that cut any rapper mind over matter 
 Lyrical dagger like alcohol I'm bad for your liver 
 Quiver, shiver body temperature get found in Hudson River 
 Deliver a message to your miss you won't be comin' over 
 And if you on the street tonight, see that ReFugee logo 
 We beam around the world like satellite 
 It's them hip-hop boys, turn your radio down 
 It's the rock 'n roll boys, turn your radio down 
 It's them reggae boys, turn your radio down 
 Neighbors mind your business 
 It's a riot again, the world is getting nervous 
 So we travel again! Main journey's the unconscious 
 It's a riot again, the world is getting nervous 
 And so we travel again! Main journey's the unconscious 
 Come rock with me 
 I got the music on the block with me 
 Come chill on the spot with me 
 And just laugh in spree 
 Yeah you're right, we got enough for everyone 
 So get all your friends and your families and come along 
 Move to the beat that's all we do we got Jerusalem 
 Everyday we offer praises like King Solomon 
 Ain't gon' hurt ye, don't be nervous 
 I'm your guardian angel, know you purpose 
 And if I look at you low, if I should make it 
 Believe me, I leave you, show you how to make it 
 Hung up high, in the M-I 
 Double-S-I, S-S-I 
 P-P-I, three-piece tie 
 Wanna see me die so the heavens they cry 
 It's them hip-hop boys, turn your radio down 
 It's the rock 'n roll boys, turn your radio down 
 It's them reggae boys, turn your radio down 
 Neighbors mind your business 
 It's a riot, riot 
 Riot, riot 
 From the train to the plane, security check 
 From the bridge to the tunnel, security check 
 It's a riot again, the world is getting nervous 
 So we travel again! Main journey's the unconscious 
 It's a riot again, the world is getting nervous 
 And so we travel again! Main journey's the unconscious 
 I was down in Texas; drivin' reckless 
 Police stop me, aks me for my license 
 (oh yeah) 
 Registration so I played him some Elvis 
 He let me go, then I lit off the chalice 
 I said if things don't change 
 We headed for the Armageddon 
 And the great dragon with seven head, ten horns 
 At the Armageddon 
 Listen to the choir children 
 The matterings of all matter 
 Masters and their extended batters 
 Internet intelligence for investments for the natural world 
 Their divestments, truth is knowledge 
 Although bipolar if it's attainment is equitable 
 Man's mirrors face the flesh but hide the spirit 
 in opposite worlds; vision can only be attained universally 
 Lamps of varied sizes and shapes carrying different shades 
 All having the propensity to illuminate 
 Let's ruminate on realization that the means is the end 
 The Earth's water is mirroring the stream-of-consciousness 
 The dead being reborn 
 As flowers smiling through the battlefields 
 It's them hip-hop boys, turn your radio down 
 It's the rock 'n roll boys, turn your radio down 
 (Flowers, smiling through the battlefield!) 
 It's a riot again, the world is getting nervous 
 So we travel again, main journey's the unconscious 
 (oh) 
 It's a riot again, the world is getting nervous 
 And so we travel again, main journey's the unconscious 
 (oh) 
 It's a riot again, the world is getting nervous 
 So we travel again, main journey's the unconscious 
 (oh) 
 It's a riot again, the world is getting nervous 
 And so we travel again, main journey's the unconscious 
 (oh)
