Here's to the state of Mississippi 
 For underneath her borders the devil draws no lines 
 The devil draws no line, if you drag her muddy river 
 Nameless bodies you will find, you will find 
 Whoa, the fat trees of the forest 
 Have hid a thousand crimes, a thousand crimes 
 The calendar is lyin' 
 When it reads the present time, the present time 
 Whoa, here's to the land 
 You've torn out the heart of, the heart of 
 Mississippi find yourself another country 
 To be part of, to be part of, yeah 
 Here's to the state of Mississippi 
 Whoa, and here's to the state of Mississippi 
 Here's to the people of Mississippi 
 Who say the folks up north they just don't understand 
 They just don't understand and they tremble in their shadows 
 At the thunder of the Klan, at the thunder of the Klan 
 The sweating of their souls 
 Can't wash the blood from their hands, from their hands 
 They smile and shrug their shoulders 
 At the murder of a man, at the murder of a man 
 Oh, here's to the land you've torn out the heart of 
 Mississippi find yourself another country to be part of, to be part of 
 Here's to the state of Mississippi 
 Whoa, and here's to the state of Mississippi 
 And here's to the cops of Mississippi 
 They're chewing their tobacco 
 As they lock the prison door, they lock prison door 
 Their bellies bounce inside them when they knock you on the floor 
 They take, no they don't like taking prisoners 
 In their private little war, in their prive little war 
 Behind their broken bades they're murderers, 
 They're murderers, they're murderers, they're murderers 
 Oh, here's to the land you've torn out the heart of 
 Mississippi find yourself another country to be part of, to be part of 
 Here's to the state of Mississippi 
 Whoa, and here's to the state of Mississippi 
 So here's to the state of Mississippi
