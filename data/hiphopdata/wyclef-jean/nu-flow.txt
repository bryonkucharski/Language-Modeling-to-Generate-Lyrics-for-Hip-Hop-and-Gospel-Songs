Ladies and Gentlemen: 
 Boys and girls 
 It is my pleasure to 
 Introduce to you all 
 The finest; the brightest; 
 The meanest; the strongest 
 The very best of them all 
 The south London collective group 
 Known as: 
 For goodness sake Roger who is it? 
 This is big bro (bro) 
 Taking over the show 
 With this new flow, flow 
 You need to listen up 
 And feel this shit, shit 
 'Cause we won't quit, quit 
 We make them hits 
 And stack them chips 
 It's Flawless I came for the doe 
 As soon as I step in the door 
 I see that you're hating my glow 
 The crew, the flow we're 
 Soon to blow 
 We're tired of being this poor 
 And having to sleep on the floor 
 And working a 9 to 5 
 Just like a five-dollar whore 
 Knowing we're worth more 
 We simply had to settle the score, 
 That's why you see these albums 
 And the singles in the store 
 It's Big Brovaz baby trying to 
 Cash some major figures 
 You mess with my cheese and I'll switch just like Schwazernegger 
 This is big bro (bro) 
 Taking over the show 
 With this new flow, flow 
 You need to listen up 
 And feel this shit, shit 
 'Cause we won't quit, quit 
 We make them hits 
 And stack them chips 
 It's Dion 
 I bet you won't forget my name 
 I probably maybe gonna 
 Get inside your brain 
 My family does the same 
 It's BB's time to reign 
 We're doing them platinum things 
 I know you're not ready for me 
 You move you lose 
 Can't wear my shoes 
 Cherise brand new 
 Me and my crew 
 Don't try our flow 
 If your tongue don't roll 
 You'll lose control 
 We're just way too cold 
 This is big bro (bro) 
 Taking over the show 
 With this new flow, flow 
 You need to listen up

 'Cause we won't quit, quit 
 We make them hits 
 And stack them chips 
 Hey yo this is Jay Rock 
 And I've got more 
 Skill's then average 
 Put us together man we're more than all of yawl can manage 
 'Cause we be the baddest at it 
 This here took years of practice 
 And now it's only more 
 Money and it's more madness 
 Stack up on a daily basis, 
 We've travelled so many places 
 Switching so many chicks were mixing up the names with faces 
 They see the ice and they trip, 
 They like to ride in the whip 
 But all I wanna know is if these girls is riding the ah 
 Who's, who's, Who's this! 
 This is the N.A.D.I you didn't 
 Think I was coming at ya 
 Giving you people a different 
 Kind of big brother flava 
 I bet yawl didn't think I be riding these beats and making the paper 
 But I guess that I'm a paper chaser playa and it's in my nature 
 This is big bro (bro) 
 Taking over the show

 You need to listen up 
 And feel this shit, shit 
 'Cause we won't quit
