(This one's goin' out to the strip joints 
 Yo, meet me at Suzy's Rendez-vous 
 For every Go-Go Bar 
 I'ma send this one out to the gentlemen's clubs 
 Magic City, New York dogs, Rolex 
 I be seeing y'all up in there late at night 
 I understand when your girl is stressing you out 
 (Mons Venus, Crazy girls) Know what I'm saying? 
 Don't let the ladies fool y'all now, fellas 
 They be doin' the same thing y'all be doin' 
 Turn up my symphony, man. 
 Turn up my symphony! 
 Drop a BEAT!) 
 Just 'cause she dances go go 
 It don't make her a ho, no 
 Maxine, put your red shoes on 
 We going to the disco 
 We gonna eeeelope to Meeeexico 
 Called up my mama, said I'm in love with a stripper, yo 
 Ten grand, let me see you shake it like you got no 
 Bones in your body and you was made to be a celebrity 
 Twenty grand, know it's a sin, but before me you show 
 Me a little more skin it would fulfill my fantasy 
 Thirty grand, to the highest bidder but Chris Rock 
 Said, 'There's no sex in the champagne room' 
 Forty grand, looked into her eyes, I saw tears falling 
 Down, type of tears that money couldn't buy 
 Just 'cause she dances go go 
 It don't make her a ho, no 
 Maxine, put your red shoes on 
 We going to the disco 
 We gonna eeeelope to Meeeexico 
 Called up my mama, said I'm in love with a stripper, yo 
 Just 'cause she dances go go 
 It don't make her a ho, no 
 Maxine, put your red shoes on 
 We going to the disco 
 We gonna eeeelope to Meeeexico 
 Called up my mama, said I'm in love with a stripper, yo 
 Wyclef: 
 Excuse me, what is your name? 
 (Ho) 
 Uh, my name is ho, yo 
 I was blessed with the body of the Goddesses 
 Have you any idea how hard this is? 
 I could flex in 25 positions 
 But I only work here to pay my tuition 
 Yo, tantalizing teaser 
 Table-top pleaser 
 Give me what I need a 
 Mastercard or Visa 
 Lap dance fantasy 
 Picture us unda your white canopy 
 Wyclef extended his hand to me 
 Like Billy D. said he's feelin' me 
 Take me away from here, so far 
 Where they ride horses, no cars 
 No more stripping in bars 
 Me and you 'Clef, against the odds 
 Just 'cause she dances go go 
 It don't make her a ho, no 
 Maxine, put your red shoes on 
 We going to the disco 
 We gonna eeeelope to Meeeexico 
 Called up my mama, said I'm in love with a stripper, yo 
 Just 'cause she dances go go 
 It don't make her a ho, no 
 Maxine, put your red shoes on 
 We going to the disco 
 We gonna eeeelope to Meeeexico 
 Called up my mama, said I'm in love with a stripper, yo 
 (Yo a lot of y'all sitting with y'all girls 
 Fronting like the Budweiser commercial 
 Talking bout, 'IIIIIII, I don't be going to the strip joints' 
 You lying man! You'd be surprised who you see up in there man. 
 I got one question for you liars, man) 
 Shot callers, What are you a preacher? 
 You calling her a hooker? He without sin cast the first stone. 
 I met her on the subway, she gave me that VIP card 
 And told me if I ever have problems, 
 Don't hesitate to come by, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Just 'cause she dances go go 
 It don't make her a ho, no 
 Maxine, put your red shoes on 
 We going to the disco 
 We gonna eeeelope to Meeeexico 
 Called up my mama, said I'm in love with a stripper, yo 
 Just 'cause she dances go go 
 It don't make her a ho, no 
 Maxine, put your red shoes on 
 We going to the disco 
 We gonna eeeelope to Meeeexico 
 Call up my mama, said I'm in love with a stripper yo! 
 (Yo baby, can I get another lap dance? I tell you I 
 Got nothing but funny money, man. New York Dogs.)
