Uh huh, uh huh 
 Feels good to be back at the essence where it all started you know 
 Uh huh, uh huh 
 What up 
 Uh huh, uh huh 
 Turn up my headphones man, uh huh uh huh 
 I got a few things I wanna tell the people out there 
 Yo, yo, yo 
 All I hear is Fugee this, Fugee that 
 Where Fugee At? I need Fugees to spit up on this track 
 Lauryn if you're listenin, Pras if you're listenin 
 Gimme a call I'm in the lab in the Booga Basement 
 Y'all know my style, I'm still *mini, money, mini, mini, 
 It ain't all about the money* 
 When I was hustla, two dogs by my side plus a black pistola 
 Loud MCs, feel the silencer 
 Y'all still rhymin, y'all cuckoo, I send cycles to Belvue 
 This ain't a sequel son, but I have you "Scream 2" (Ah!) 
 Real live cinema of the streets produced a junkie 
 Put back on your shirt man you lookin' like ET 
 You're cracked out, for dough, some blow on saxophone 
 You're rhymin off beat even with help from my metronomes 
 See, y'all ain't MCs, you a CM 
 Common Motherfucker rhymin about Lexus and Benz 
 The same Benz you got jacked in, drunk off of Gin 
 You woke up in hell gettin' sexed by Marilyn Manson 
 You lie, you deny, pass me the microphone 
 I guess like Eddie Murphy you was givin' 'em a ride home 
 Yeah right, 25 mics, material in The Source 
 While your rap crew's on steroids lookin' like Full Force 
 Your girl she's buffed, puffed, in daytime don't play rough 
 The freaks come out at night so that's when I bring out the cuffs 
 Grandma Marnier, CD player number two 
 Shadae's in my bedroom singin' "sweetest taboo" 
 We used to rap, now y'all wanna come and get me with a bat? 
 Y'all must be smokin' crack, with Pookie from New Jack 
 How could y'all forget, I'm the reason y'all MC 
 But y'all flip like Pharisees and charge me for blasphemy 
 You know who you are, eight bar superstar 
 Karate cars, buy up the bars with the credit cards 
 You wanna impress, I'm young chick, you just met 
 First thing she say, "I used to run with Wyclef" 
 Look surprised, see your flesh outside your vest 
 Yeah you could fight, in the WWF 
 'Cause in this arena ain't nothin' but gladiators and haters 
 Hopin they kill me and roll and feed me to the tigers 
 Oh Lord, protect me from the devil 
 They open the book of life, y'all readin like the anti Christ 
 Your weak kid, stop lyin' to the public 
 You wanted it so bad that you took all the production credits 
 Some MCs in the underground, mad at me 'cause I'm above ground 
 Counting English pounds 
 I tell ya what, success don't come overnight 
 I was in Noah's Ark for Forty days and Forty nights 
 Contemplatin what should I write, what should I recite 
 'Cause ain't nobody here but thugs and chicks wit ice 
 That's when I daydream into the twilight 
 Girls wit they man, screamin "I hate life" 
 Baby girl look in the opposite direction 
 'Cause my class is the *Misedu...*
