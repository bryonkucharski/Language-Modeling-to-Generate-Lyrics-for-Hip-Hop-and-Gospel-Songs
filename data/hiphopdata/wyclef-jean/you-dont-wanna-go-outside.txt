Wyclef Jean with Spragga Benz 
 You know I got the reggae mix but this ain't complete 
 Know what I mean? To all the girls I cheated on before 
 Right about now all my thugs around the world 
 If you love reggae music I want you to do this 
 Check it out, yo 
 Ah, put your lighter in the air, right, right 
 Put your lighter in the air, right, right 
 Put your lighter in the air, right, right 
 This is going straight to number one, check it out, yo 
 Chickenhead 
 (Jack it up, jack it up) 
 Hey yo, what's your prize tonight? 
 (Yes, we have to jack it up) 
 I see it in your eyes 
 (Yes, we have to jack it up) 
 You'll be alright tonight 
 To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year 
 Hey yo, dear queen, by the time you get this letter 
 It's four pages but my name ain't Aaliyah 
 I don't know much about biology or chemistry 
 Failed the S.A.T.'s, study Brooklyn zoology 
 Remember me, Wyclef, the memory 
 Ecstasy with no theory of manoghany 
 To be or not to be, last words from Shakespeare 
 But a package says I wanna get the bitch with no fear 
 A few good men in a new millennium 
 Woman got a new law, if you cheat you're a dead man 
 So I've been dead like hundred times 
 Ask Cyndi Lauper, she'll tell you time after time 
 She became an infomaniac, wanted it all the time 
 A thin line between love and lust 
 She mistake me for the rapper when I said Can-I-Bus 
 Chickenhead 
 (Jack it up, jack it up) 
 Hey yo, what's your prize tonight? 
 (Yes, we have to jack it up) 
 I see it in your eyes 
 (Yes, we have to jack it up) 
 You'll be alright tonight 
 (To all the girls I cheated on before) 
 (Spragga Benz, where're you at, wher're you at?) 
 Chickenhead in a di bed, I feel dead, I feel dead 
 We have to jack it up, jack it up, keep up your head 
 Chickenhead in a di bed, I feel dead, I feel dead 
 We have to jack it up, jack it up, jack it up, yo 
 See my gal, she a gimme a hug each day I come 
 Each an hour, understand, now she be on the bum 
 Wake up in di morning, all she know we are alone 
 Each day I cheat on a chickenhead I figure on 
 Bust it, man, I go chill, me called a gal you wanna kill 
 She have faith, she have di skill 
 I know she want it she will 
 Gimme the right, a me remember 
 Me have to come back for November 
 But the gal fe mi calendar forget that be the day 
 Chickenhead in a di beb, I feel dead, I feel dead 
 We have to jack it up, jack it up, keep up your head 
 Chickenhead in a di bed, I feel dead, I feel dead 
 We have to jack it up, jack it up, jack it up, jack it up 
 (Yo Spragga Man, what's going on?) 
 Chicken head 
 (Jack it up, jack it up) 
 Hey yo, what's your prize tonight? 
 (Yes, we have to jack it up) 
 I see it in your eyes 
 (Yes, we have to jack it up) 
 You'll be alright tonight 
 To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year 
 Yo, yo, from the college dorm, until dusk is dawn 
 I never felt cold until I lost one 
 Don't let go like En Vogue chocked on 
 Clash of the titans, now I'm in my unicorn 
 I left New Jerus, I'm on my way to Brooklawn 
 Someone hit my bumper, I turned around and saw Sharon 
 Got surprised because I saw little Shawn 
 In the passenger seat with a bottle of Dom 
 Remain calm, called Cocren on the horn 
 Salaam, warm up the jeep 'cause a murder about to go on 
 What the bomb, bomb but this ain't a reggae song 
 It's like a old flick, Godzilla vs King Kong 
 If you saw the movie than you know what's gonna happen 
 Down South, West Coast, than back to Manhattan 
 Like Vanessa from 'Soul food' when she came at night 
 Thank God, it was a dream 'cause I woke up with my wife 
 Chicken head 
 (Jack it up, jack it up) 
 Hey yo, what's your prize tonight? 
 (Yes, we have to jack it up) 
 I see it in your eyes 
 (Yes, we have to jack it up) 
 You'll be alright tonight 
 Thugs around the world, yo 
 Ah, put your lighter in the air, right, right 
 Put your lighter in the air, right, right 
 Put your lighter in the air, right, right 
 Salaam Remi, Wyclef Jean, Spragga Benz 
 Nobody's safe no more 
 Lock your door, chickenheads on the loose 
 Oah, I'm out, Refugee Camp 
 ABC, for your crews wanna test 
 Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
