Yeah, I was looking out my window 
 When I heard this sounds 
 Look up into the sky 
 Saw the moon turn to blood 
 Looked at my little brother 
 Said, "you high as hell maaan" 
 Apocalypse... 
 1,2 the headlines youths just rolled through 
 Apocalypse... 
 3,4 solder, 100 horsemen at your door 
 Apocalypse... 
 5,6 you wanted dead or alive, hit or miss 
 We we y'all, yeah, we we y'all 
 Verse One: 
 Arrival of the Carnival 
 New beats, I never recycle 
 While you looking for samples 
 You might get trampled 
 Surprise, hey 
 I'm back with lightning and thunder 
 I heard you over saying that I was a one year wonder 
 You dumb or some, I went to refugees 
 Silly felony, when I'm done 
 Collect royalty from record company's 
 Clouds getting darker 
 Suns getting nearer 
 I'll turn a atheist into a god fearing believer 
 The back of a building 
 Your body's found by children 
 Playin' hide go seek 
 What we found was his skeleton 
 In the back of a car 
 You spawned with the wrong guard 
 You know my empire strikes back hard 
 Missles launched, war 
 Is the day after ashes 
 Projects, cannons 
 Being launched hit the palace 
 Vision, revelation 
 Sky wrote apocalypse 
 Enemy pilots kamikaze into the abyss 
 Apocalypse... 
 1,2 the headlines youths just rolled through 
 Apocalypse... 
 3,4 solder, 100 horsemen at your door 
 Apocalypse... 
 5,6 you wanted dead or alive, hit or miss 
 We we y'all, yeah, we we y'all, yeah, we we y'all 
 Verse Two: 
 A yo, Back on earth 
 The party's at the tunnel 
 On the west side of the river 
 Went mad quiver 
 Rats get fed to the alligator 
 Gun blast equivalent to the bombs in pearl harbor 
 Rescue choppers brooklyn turn to hiroshima 
 I'm driving to jersey to escape the terror 
 I was on the highway pushing a black viper 
 A car pulls up, is he a jack or a sniper (sniper) 
 A blue range rover, he says pull over 
 I didn't know he was a DT undercover 
 I screamed out my lungs 
 This is discrimination! 
 What's the charge?, he said you just robbed a gas station 
 Who me? not me! it couldn't be 
 I was in the Grammys with Brandy 
 Didn't you see me on TV? 
 Bullshit, you're all in the same game 
 He tried to run me off the road 
 Like he was Rosco P. Coltrain. 
 I stayed calm, gave him a hell of a show 
 'Cause when its time to go 
 All I gotta press is turbo 
 Heard it on his walkie, road block on 280 west 
 Things got serious, that's when I bust a left 
 U-Turn, my eyes burned 
 My concern was a truck coming 
 Head on collision within a chase position 
 Close one, I almost went up in a blaze 
 Running from what appears to be a masquerade 
 Least that what I thought, it was all in my mind 
 Reality stuck when I got to the borderline 
 The headline reads every ghettos sad story 
 A rookie shoots a boy over mistaken identity... 
 (Crash) 
 Chorus repeat (2X)
