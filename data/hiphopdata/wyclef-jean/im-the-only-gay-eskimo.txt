I'm the only gay eskimo 
 I'm the only one I know 
 I'm the only gay eskimo 
 In my tribe 
 I go out seal hunting with my best friend Tarka 
 But all I wanna do is get into his parka 
 I'm the only gay eskimo 
 In my tribe 
 Well ... me an nut fluck chuck buck, we both like blubber 
 But me I've got this crazy fetish for rubber 
 I'm the only gay eskimo 
 In my tribe 
 I make a wish on the northern lights 
 That I could get a decent pair of whale skin tights 
 I'm the only gay eskimo 
 In my tribe 
 And the seals they sing now 
 *Seal noises* 
 These cold winter nights are taking their toll 
 I even get excited when I see the north pole 
 See the north pole 
 I'm the only gay eskimo 
 I'm the only one I know 
 I'm the only gay eskimo 
 In my tribe
