I'll never forget 
 Here's what they say when I came to Africa 
 "It's going to change my life." 
 I ain't understand what they were saying 
 Until I landed in Africa 
 I'll never forget the first time 
 My plane landed down there in Africa 
 10,000 people came to the airport 
 So they can come greet the Rasta 
 Arrived at the hotel, through that get-me start 
 After that called up my mother 
 I told then, "Thank you, mama, to all that drama 
 You'd said I would make it as an African."
