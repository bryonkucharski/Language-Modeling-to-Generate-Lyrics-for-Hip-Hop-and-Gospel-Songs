This is not the burial, it's the resurrection 
 Hey kids gather 'round 
 It's DJ Muggs, with Wyclef 
 Aha, I got a story to tell, check it out, c'mon 
 What do you mean, John 3:16? 
 For God so loved the world, every man packs an M-16 
 Says the boy to the fiend 
 What do you mean? Huh 
 What do you mean, John 3:16? 
 For God so loved the world, every man packs an M-16 
 I wanna wake up from this dream 
 Check it out 
 I caught the bullet, I was stumblin' like a mulet 
 Drink White Russian, game, Russian roulette 
 Flight Continental six o'clock in the mornin' 
 Briefcase full o' cocaine on my way out, I tipped the doorman 
 Jumped into the cab said, "Hail Mary, full of Grace" 
 Yesterday communion was the Mafia's reunion 
 Confessed to the priest, evade the apple, I ate the peach 
 Slept with Vanity, sold my soul to Robin Leach 
 Devil music in my ear, no fear, I'm pumpin' Def Leppard 
 Slow down, here comes the narc with the German shepherd 
 I got the plan, man, meet me in the van 
 I got this kid from the Sudan bringin' tecs from Iran 
 What do you mean, John 3:16? 
 For God so loved the world, every man packs an M-16 
 Says the boy to the fiend 
 What do you mean? What do you mean? 
 What do you mean, John 3:16? 
 For God so loved the world, every one packs an M-16 
 Says the girl to the fiend 
 So in the streets, the product must be clean 
 Five-eleven, the young one went to Heaven 
 Yo with the gun to his head, yo he was already dead 
 Sunday mornin' in court, the judge got Wyclef confessin' 
 "Yo, I murdered Steve Austin," now I'm wanted by Bionic Woman 
 Women bring you more miseries like that movie 
 Stress go to India, smoke hashish with Gandhi 
 My bills of rights is to make sure you're all right 
 Superman left the gang, 'cause his weakness was Crips-tonight 
 Godfather got the cottonballs to his cheeks 
 Pig couldn't fly straight so you die in your sleep 
 I stay awake only to see Nicodemus 
 The young one got murdered, the day was the Sabbath 
 What do you mean, John 3:16? 
 For God so loved the world, every man packs an M-16 
 What do you mean, says the boy to the fiend 
 Why we killin' for the green? 
 What do you mean, John 3:16? 
 For God so loved the world, every one packs an M-16 
 Says the girl to the fiend 
 I wanna wake up from this dream 
 I know this drug dealer, who drive a black Beamer 
 Dreadlock cut off once by this girl named Delilah 
 Pretty little dancer, voice like Tina Turner 
 Chickenheads are you a virgin? Yeah right, so was Madonna 
 S-s-sinner, sinner, seek the master 
 If not, feel the explosion from the day after 
 Bit by the vampire, worked for the mobster 
 Two to the head and now you swimmin' with the lobsters 
 We got'cha got'cha, set up in Oklahoma 
 You caught a bad one like a kid catchin' pneumonia 
 So storyteller, what's the moral of this story? 
 Live reality and don't get caught up in your fantasy 
 What do you mean, John 3:16? 
 For God so loved the world, every man packs an M-16 
 Says the boy to the fiend 
 Aren't we all human beings? 
 What do you mean, John 3:16? 
 For God so loved the world, every man packs an M-16 
 But the dream is still for green 
 So we die in the steam 
 What do you mean, John 3:16? 
 This is how it is around the way, y'knahmsayin' Muggs? 
 Wyclef and it don't stop 
 Refugee Camp, bing 
 What do you mean, John 3:16?
