Yeah, now I'm a rock-star, it started with my imagination 
 Used to gaze at the twins before the birds hit 'em 
 Daydream about the God, my axe, my Excalibur 
 A man, who just saw the future beyond the dishwater 
 Yeah, cab driver used to gyspy cab rider 
 But she stuck with me when I had nothin', so I had to wife her 
 And I used write these thoughts on a black and white notebook 
 Haitian experience, now I'm a page in a book 
 I'm a Haitian, Haitian 
 When I landed in America, 'Merica 
 I got myself a green card, green card 
 Mamma say, if I ever break the law, they gon' send me back home 
 This is my Haitian experience 
 First stop out in England, England 
 Immigration send me back to Washington, Washington 
 Said I need a visa if I wanted to be in the United Kingdom 
 I pray that the Queen of Buckingham is listening 
 Your Highness, I got a palace out in Port Au Prince 
 I got a hundred acres and a whole lotta land 
 But I can't go back and see my people in the ticks 
 I'm a Haitian in America 
 When papa first got his green card, worked seven jobs in America 
 Then he came and got me from Haiti, told me I had one chance 
 To make it in America 
 In the legal Valley and lookin' for work in Manhattan in America 
 My papa was a Haitian, Haitian 
 He got to America, 'Merica 
 On a six month visa, visa 
 When the visa expired, he went underground like rats in the sewer 
 This is the Haitian experience 
 Runnin' from the Immigration interrogation 
 But his vision was his chosen 
 (How you gon' get us to New York?) 
 Absolute lost and at sea and never see the airport 
 Yeah, I pray that the President is up there listenin' 
 Your Excellence, I got a palace out in Port Au Prince 
 I got a hundred acres and a whole lotta land 
 So we go move from detention, we go, we build the land 
 I'm a Haitian in America 
 When papa first got his green card, worked seven jobs in America 
 Then he came and got me from Haiti, told me I had one chance 
 To make it in America 
 So I learned to play guitar with dreams of becomin' a rock star 
 (In America) 
 (I'm a Haitian) 
 I'm a Haitian in America 
 When papa first got his green card, worked seven jobs in America 
 Then he came and got me from Haiti, told me I had one chance 
 To make it in America 
 In the legal Valley and lookin' for work in Manhattan in America 
 What we gon' do right now is we gon' go back 
 Way back 
 To what I call Lassie 
 The roots, the Haitian experience 
 Let's go 
 Look in her eyes, she will survive 
 She smiles like she's in love 
 She's 21, she lost her feedin' arms 
 But she ain't lose her soul, dancin' outta control 
 Like Angelina Ballerina 
 Like Angelina Ballerina 
 Like Angelina Ballerina 
 Yes, I'm a Haitian in America 
 When papa first got his green card, worked seven jobs in America 
 Then he came and got me from Haiti, told me I had one chance 
 To make it in America 
 In the legal Valley and lookin' for work in Manhattan in America 
 Man, I just got on a plane leavin' Haiti 
 And I landed in Brooklyn, New York City, Cooney Island 
 Marlboro Projects, man, in projects, it's so rough to blend in 
 I learned to how to rock, sing, dance, pop, loc, whatever it took 
 (Foreign Content) 
 Yeah, that's my dad, a Haitian livin' in America
