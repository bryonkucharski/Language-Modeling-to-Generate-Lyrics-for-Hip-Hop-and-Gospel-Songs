Yo yo, this Wyclef, alongside DJ Skribble (for the ladies) 
 Yo Skribble I have one question 
 Could you please answer this for me? 
 I gotta know this yo 
 What makes a DJ *cut and scratched "fresh"* 
 What makes an MC *cut and scratch "fresh"* 
 What makes the ReFugees *scratch "fresh"* 
 Why are kids getting jealous? 
 'Cause we F, R, E, S, H 
 Fresh, fresh, fresh, that's, fresh! 
 F, R, E, S, H 
 Fresh, fresh, fresh, that's, fresh! 
 Hey you, player, with the dibble and the dabble 
 You wanna battle who? Wyclef or DJ Skribble 
 Hold the stickup it's a freestyle session 
 Skribble where you from man *scratched "Long Island"* 
 Well I'm from Haiti, then Brooklyn, then Jersey 
 With a universal tag, plus I got *scratched "money in the bag"* 
 You slept on this musician, plus the hip-hop art 
 Bring your best MC's *scratched "What?"* 
 Cause every man got disciples if you ever want a rival 
 Show up, with a mic, and a rifle 
 Wyclef stuck the bank at mid-day 
 And took all of Sony money, in a black van he got away 
 I just got a call from Tommy Mottola 
 He said forget about it "oh my word" 
 So I held John Agrassia, at gunpoint 
 He's shook, callin Donny Aiena, while smokin' a joint 
 I said, 'Who's the informer?' They say, 'Michael Malden' 
 I had to take him out "Three the hard way!" 
 The moral of this story don't blame the record company 
 If your record ain't selling you lack creativity 
 But what you want me to say? What what you want me to say huh? 
 Yo I've been trying to get a deal for, years and it ain't 
 What you want me to say? 
 *Cut and scratched "hehehehehehe"* 
 *Cut and scratched "ju-ju-just shut up"* 
 *Cut and scratched "Bite it!"* 
 *Mix the above three*
