The streets is mad right now 
 Tell 'em why we mad 
 Rappers whatever you call yourself 
 Pack ya bags and get out of town 
 'Cause I'ma strike down on thee wit great vengeance and furious anger 
 Those who attempt to poison da hood 
 I'ma let y'all know da preacher's son is back 
 Uh, Refugee, one time, one time 
 Uh, M.O.P., two time, two time, one time 
 Bumpy knuckles now the world is in trouble 
 Come on 
 Yo, you're number one on the charts 
 You're a masquerade 
 Paid for your billboard slots 
 You're a masquerade 
 Because the block knows hot 
 You're a masquerade 
 You're livin' in a uh 
 You're livin' in a masquerade 
 I'm on first 
 So, this ain't a rap verse 
 It's more like a voodoo curse 
 So when you die the kids'll throw rocks at ya hearse 
 Cause you lie too much 
 You don't got no gat 
 At your arm reach is ink 
 At your headpiece now you pissin in your briefs 
 Hold up 
 We just saw you on your BET and MTV, a public access channel 
 Talkin' bout I'ma thug 
 You're an animal, a canibal, you even scare hannibal 
 But when the blackout came no light for your candle 
 So welcome to the real world where a spade is a spade 
 And I'ma call it like I see it 
 Ay, y'all living in a masquerade 
 Even though Jacob iced you out wit the baguettes 
 Money wit no respect, that makes you a suspect 
 So you can't ride through Brownsville 
 You want peace you better call Churchill 
 If not, feel Clef when he connects wit M.O.P. family and plays guitar at your eulogy 
 You wanna claim you run da block 
 You're a masquerade 
 Givin' information to the cops 
 You're a masquerade 
 I mean you never seen a rock 
 You're livin' in a uh 
 You're livin' in a masquerade 
 Masquerade 
 Now the grimy lil bastards line up 
 Time's up 
 I'm up 
 They say we dem dans to show you how to get it crunk 
 I'm still plottin wit Fox 
 Today 
 I do it wit Clef 
 Whoever 
 We throw mack and that's to the death bless royalty 
 You youngstas better get back before you get a set back and get clapped 
 That's it and that's that 
 Clef 
 Hold that 
 Take all dat and fall back 
 I kick too much ass 
 Kick ass 
 To rock jewels, rock Prada 
 F-ck Gucci shoes, Timbs mo hotta 
 We still grip arms Brook norm bound sh-t 
 The streets don't want that watered down sh-t 
 Fam, we clear the whole stage 
 You don't wannaa ride wit us 
 We got road rage 
 Now I'ma let my hood tell you 
 You're a masquerade 
 I bet you feedin the dogs 
 You're a masquerade 
 I thought we still and we rob 
 You're a masquerade 
 You're livin' in a uh 
 You're livin' in a masquerade 
 I'm hittin sixteen bars 
 A murder, real murder, baby 
 This ain't a façade 
 Nigas pumpin they fist like they punchin at gods 
 Over ten years rippin MC 
 I bring it hard 
 Don't make me split yo chest and pull yo card 
 R&B singer the greatest and now barred 
 'Cause he been feelin' on booties of too young cuties 
 Got mo bombs left 
 You punk nigas, we used to shake your pumpy hands 
 You'll have no arms left 
 You ain't a pimp 
 You ain't a mack 
 You keep biches in the house all day 
 I keep 'em on the track 
 Drinkin' cocoa and wearin long mink coats black 
 Hit 'em twelve-inch stilettos 
 Tappin through the ghetto 
 I can see it in your eyes 
 Little nigas you ain't a part of shakin nigas hand, shakin nigas heart 
 I keep the underground in shape 
 It never be soft 
 You wanna make it like them fat naked biches turnin' me off 
 Now I'ma let my hood tell you 
 You're a masquerade 
 I bet you feedin the dogs 
 You're a masquerade 
 I thought we still and we rob 
 You're a masquerade 
 You're livin' in a uh 
 You're livin' in a masquerade 
 Neary Paneary won't you take 'em to the Middle East
