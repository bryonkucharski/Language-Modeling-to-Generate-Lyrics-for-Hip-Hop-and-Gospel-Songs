Ehhhh, zhe, zhe, zhe, zhe 
 I was four, four years old 
 When the Marine left Haiti, the U.S. Marine left Haiti 
 I was a kid and every time a Marine battalion passed in front of the house 
 My father took my hand and said, 
 "Don't look at that, don't look at that." 
 And every May 18, which is the flag day, the father came 
 Put the Haitian flag in front of the house 
 And I said, "Father, what is that, what does that mean for you?" 
 And he said,"That means that you are Haitian. 
 That mean that my great grandfather fought at Vertières 
 Never forget that. 
 You are Haitian. You are from this land. 
 You are not French, you are not British, you are not American 
 You are Haitian."
