I'm ready, I'm ready 
 Check, 'Clef, to, rock 
 Hey, I'm dancin with this girl, you find your own girl 
 (Oh-own girl, oh-own-girl, oh-own-girl, oh-own-girl) 
 It's still no fightin' tonight though homey, yeah 
 Geyeah, it's all love tonight 
 My love good for all season, winter summer fall spring 
 I got de shaman ram flow, ting-a-ling-a-ling 
 Columbian swing when Shaki do her t'ing 
 One bright feed the power like Lords of the Ring 
 Many fight fi the crown, but there's only one King 
 Many girls want the title, but there's only one Queen 
 One King for the Queen, one Queen for the King 
 I don't wanna wake up if this thing is a dream 
 If you have no home, I'll be your shelter 
 Baby, don't be scared 
 If you lost your sight, I would be your eyes 
 Lead you in the spotlight 
 If you've enough time, I will be one time 
 Only to be with you tonight 
 But there is never, never enough time 
 To make it forever mine 
 Time after time, you get better like fine wine 
 I look into your eyes and see your soul in the skyline 
 Call me Mr. Freeze, I feel a chill in my spineline 
 'Cause every time you touch me, it's like a divine sign 
 Many fight fi the crown, but there's only one King 
 Many girls want the title, but there's only one Queen 
 One King for the Queen, one Queen for the King 
 I don't wanna wake up if this thing is a dream 
 If you have no home, I'll be your shelter 
 (yeah) 
 Baby, don't be scared 
 If you lost your sight, I would be your eyes 
 Lead you in the spotlight 
 If you've enough time, I will be one time 
 (yeah) 
 Only to be with you tonight 
 But there is never, never enough time 
 (yes) 
 To make it forever mine 
 And I don't wanna put out this fire 
 Transition like a knight, mama 
 I feel my place where the soul get higher 
 Nights get cold I gotta hold ya 
 Nights that we slept in the middle of the sofa 
 Holes in our loafer, but we had each other 
 Christmas throw Santa down the chimney 
 Felt like Pookie from New Jack when he got the turkey 
 'Cause we those ReFugees, survive the tsunami 
 So ain't nobody gonna tell me this ain't what I need 
 If you have no home, I'll be your shelter 
 (yeah) 
 Baby, don't be scared 
 If you lost your sight, I would be your eyes 
 (yeah) 
 Lead you in the spotlight 
 If you've enough time, I will be one time 
 (yeah) 
 Only to be with you tonight 
 But there is never, never enough time 
 (yes) 
 To make it forever mine 
 Shaki', 'Clef 
 Jerry Wonder what we tell 'em boy 
 (Find your own girl, find your own girl, find your own girl, find your own girl) 
 Yo Cliff, let the horns go 
 (Find your own girl, find your own girl, find your own girl, find your own girl)
