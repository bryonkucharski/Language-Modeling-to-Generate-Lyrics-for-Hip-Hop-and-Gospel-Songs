By the rivers of Babylon, 
 There we sat down 
 Yeah we wept, 
 When we remembered Zion. 
 By the rivers of Babylon, 
 There we sat down 
 Yeah we wept, 
 When we remembered Zion. 
 When the wicked 
 Carried us away in captivity 
 Required from us a song 
 Now how shall we sing the lord's song 
 In a strange land 
 When the wicked 
 Carried us away in captivity 
 Required from us a song 
 Now how shall we sing the lord's song 
 In a strange land 
 Let the words of our mouths 
 And the meditations of our hearts 
 Be acceptable in thy sight here tonight 
 Let the words of our mouths 
 And the meditations of our hearts 
 Be acceptable in thy sight here tonight 
 By the rivers of Babylon, 
 There we sat down 
 Yeah we wept, 
 When we remembered Zion. 
 By the rivers of Babylon, 
 There we sat down 
 Yeah we wept, 
 When we remembered Zion. 
 By the rivers of Babylon, 
 There we sat down 
 Yeah we wept, 
 When we remembered Zion. 
 By the rivers of Babylon, 
 There we sat down 
 Yeah we wept, 
 When we remembered Zion. 
 By the rivers of Babylon, 
 There we sat down 
 Yeah we wept, 
 When we remembered Zion. 
 When we remembered Zion.
