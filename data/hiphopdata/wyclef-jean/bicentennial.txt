 With the peoples band 
 Every time the djs play us 
 People jump around and pay us 
 After call them shades 
 Now put your hands up on my waist 
 No need to come to the altahome 
 And wash your sheets and I'm on the phone 
 We've been kicked, we've been stabbed, we've been shot 
 Lord we've been abused, Lord knows 
 Everytime they throw us down 
 We stand up and hold our ground 
 Get it right, get it right 
 Get salsa, samba
