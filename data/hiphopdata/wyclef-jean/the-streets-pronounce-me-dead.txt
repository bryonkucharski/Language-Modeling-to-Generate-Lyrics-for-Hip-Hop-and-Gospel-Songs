The return of the hip hop ammadeus 
 Wyclef Toussaint St. Jean drama 
 Streets pronounce me dead 
 Streets pronounce me dead 
 Streets pronounce me dead 
 Streets pronounce me dead 
 Streets pronounce me dead 
 Streets pronounce me dead 
 I tell 'em I'm alive but rumor says I'm dead 
 The resurrection of the dead, I could never get 
 And if I ever die, all I do is ride 
 The streets pronounce me dead 
 Puttin' two holes in my head 
 At the funeral, I had more friends than the grateful dead 
 Haters started talkin' sayin' I went left 
 Akon took my spot, will.i.am took my vest 
 Started beatin' on the coffin 'cause I could hear the crowd 
 But they can't hear me 'cause Lil' Jon's preachin' too loud 
 That's when the bishop said last words for friends and family 
 Then the fans stood up and said y'all forgot the Fugees 
 Fifty million records sold straight from the basement 
 How y'all gon' tell me Wyclef is irrelevant 
 A rapper stood up and said, yup I got amnesia 
 Last time I remember him was Gone 'til November 
 He said I don't spit no more, all I do is sing songs 
 Last time he felt me was when I rhymed with Big Pun 
 That's right get the hate off ya chest 
 You a rap con artist, not a Kanye West 
 (I ain't dead) 
 Streets pronounce me dead 
 Streets pronounce me dead 
 Streets pronounce me dead 
 Streets pronounce me dead 
 Streets pronounce me dead 
 Streets pronounce me dead 
 I tell 'em I'm alive but rumor says I'm dead 
 The resurrection of the dead, I could never get 
 And if I ever die, all I do is ride 
 I mean the streets say it's been a while since they heard me spit 
 That I spit so hard, my ghostwriter must be cannabis 
 But far permit, this is how I started 
 But my battle raps couldn't get me groceries from the super market 
 So I found another target to aim at 
 I went from food stamps to the black a mac's 
 Eight track cassettes, the CD's, the iPod's 
 Bmx bixes, the hoopdies, the hot rods 
 And my swag come from Nazareth 
 How you gon' say I'm dead when I rose like Lazareth 
 And this ain't mystic, I ain't talkin' voodoo 
 We do carry spears like the Zulu's 
 So watch your mouth boy, I ain't dead 
 Fo' the city gon' turn red, blood will shed 
 So before you speak boy watch your tone 
 Fo' my chrome gon' turn you to a statue of stone 
 (I ain't dead) 
 Streets pronounce me dead 
 Streets pronounce me dead 
 Streets pronounce me dead 
 Streets pronounce me dead 
 Streets pronounce me dead 
 Streets pronounce me dead 
 I tell 'em I'm alive but rumor says I'm dead 
 The resurrection of the dead, I could never get 
 And if I ever die, all I do is ride 
 They all got shocked when I rose from the coffin 
 Dust my self off then headed out to new Jerusalem 
 Destroyed and rebuilt, my voice sound like silk 
 Audio tune like milk, I used to shop lift with no guilt 
 And Christmas time toy guns the size of elves 
 I seen the ra-ta-ta-ta turn into the real shells 
 Yup killa, you press ya luck 
 Went to sleep in the pond, woke up with the ducks 
 And this ain't gangsta talk, I don't talk the talk 
 I suggest you walk or get outlined in chalk 
 And you ain't from the street 
 But yet you walk the streets 
 You a C, O, P, a cop walkin' the beat 
 But the rule on the streets they could turn on you 
 Like a pit bull after givin' him food 
 Or the girl that you bought all the cars and the jewels 
 Only to find out on memorial dey fuckin' in the swimmin' pool 
 (I ain't dead) 
 Streets pronounce me dead 
 Streets pronounce me dead 
 Streets pronounce me dead 
 Streets pronounce me dead 
 Streets pronounce me dead 
 Streets pronounce me dead 
 I tell 'em I'm alive but rumor says I'm dead 
 The resurrection of the dead, I could never get 
 And if I ever die, all I do is ride 
 Yea 
 Warriors music 
 Drama 
 From the hut, to the projects, to the mansions 
 So y'all know you, y'all ain't got no excuses 
 I'm alive 
 Wyclef aka Toussaint St Jean
