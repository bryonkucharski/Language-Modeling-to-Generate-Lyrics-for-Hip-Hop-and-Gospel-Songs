 (New millennium, pump this in your jeeps) 
 This is for all y'all out there 
 That ever dealt with somebody (Pump this in your jeeps) 
 Who lyin' fakin' cheatin' 
 Stealin' creeping, B-Sin' (Pump this in your jeeps) 
 I got this thing called the lie detector 
 Two tea-spoons and they're bound to tell the truth (Pump this in your jeeps) 
 Listen 
 (Mya) 
 You told me, that I was your fantasy yeah 
 You said that we would practice monogamy 
 So I became a freak under the sheets 
 Put his ass to sleep creeped into the kitchen 
 And got the remedy it's called the lie detector 
 I slipped it in his drink I brought it to his bedside 
 And said take a sip of this and don't think 
 You won't believe what happened 
 When he sipped the lie detector 
 Looked into his eyes 
 Asked him where you been? 
 He said it's no surprise 
 'Cause I've been with my ex girl 
 Why'd you tell me the truth? 
 He said you wanted to hear the truth 
 Sometimes I wish I never gave him a detector 
 I thought he loved me but he loved her 
 So I'm kind of glad he took the lie detector 
 Now I know the truth so you can get the boot 
 (Beenie Man) 
 Man you have to you have to you have to go mami 
 Tie up tie up tie up clothes yeah 
 End of end of end of the road 
 Once you find out you gonna light up 
 (Mya) 
 She told you 
 Baby let's get married 
 Always been faithful 
 Let's spend eternity 
 So he became a freak under the sheets 
 Put her ass to sleep 
 Creep into the kitchen 
 Got the remedy 
 It's called the lie detector 
 Slipped it in her drink 
 Brought it to her bedside 
 And said take a sip of this and don't think 
 (Beenie Man) 
 Now to all the women of the country 
 It ain't my fault 
 If the girl ain't want for love me 
 Truly want to meet me 
 Kind of girl that want to 
 Too many girls they sugar 
 They want to kiss me 
 Anyway my life is sweet 
 My girl is neat 
 I know the streets 
 Girls jumping at my feet 
 Well my brides are few 
 Oh I see we don't defeat 
 From your lovin' girl is but a treat 
 (Mya (Beenie Man]] 
 If you got a need for some prescriptions (Baby it's all up to your expectations) 
 Make sure that it's with communication (Look out for your man 'cause he put down the foundation) 
 Don't want to find yourself asking how did this happen (Ma just shows my love is not open) 
 Friday the thirteenth went to the movies (Baby hurry up and get goofy) 
 You won't believe what happened 
 When he gave the lie detector 
 Picked up the pager numbers 
 Said who's called sixty-nine? 
 She said don't be surprise 
 'Cause it's been your best friend 
 He looked and swallow his pride 
 Felt like crying, but guys don't cry 
 Sometimes he wished he never gave her a detector 
 But thought she loved him, but she loved his best friend 
 But now he's kind of glad she took the lie detector 
 He found out the truth so he gave her the boot 
 (Beenie Man) 
 Hey you have to you have to you have to go mami 
 Tie up tie up tie up clothes yeah 
 End of end of end of the road 
 Once you find out, ya gonna light up 
 You have to you have to you have to go mami 
 Tie up tie up tie up clothes yeah 
 End of end of end of the road 
 Once you find out you gonna light up
