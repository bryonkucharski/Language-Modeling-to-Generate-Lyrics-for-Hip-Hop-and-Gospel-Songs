Yeah 
 Guess who's in the carnival this year? 
 Yeah 
 Wyclef, alongside Bud and my refugees 
 We gonna hit them with the rhythm of the night 
 Refugee is going to leave them all behind 
 We gonna hit them with the rhythm of the night 
 Refugee is gonna take them on a flight 
 ??? 
 We gonna hit them with the rhythm of the night 
 Refugee is going to leave them all behind 
 We gonna hit them with the rhythm of the night 
 Refugee is gonna take them on a flight 
 I ain't shy, no proper playa hater 
 I'm sure I do do why? 
 I ain't shy, no proper lying son? 
 Ce va no francais 
 ? 
 Ladies fine, let us get closer 
 Let me see you go down a little lower 
 Don't cheat and hold on to my shoulder 
 Want to see who's some real bad breakups 
 Sex entwined and I got my drink on 
 Don't push and spill the hatuva? 
 Carnival and it's time to party y'all 
 If you'll permit me then the bag will hate with y'all 
 ??? 
 ??? 
 Right now get your flags 
 And this is what I want y'all to do 
 Wave to the east 
 Wave to the east 
 Wave to the east 
 Wave to the east 
 Wave to the east 
 Wave to the east 
 All my ladies 
 And my shorties 
 All my ladies 
 (Creole French Lyrics)

 We gonna hit them with the rhythm of the night 
 Refugee is going to leave them all behind 
 We gonna hit them with the rhythm of the night 
 Refugee is gonna take them on a flight 
 We gonna hit them with the rhythm of the night 
 Refugee is going to leave them all behind
