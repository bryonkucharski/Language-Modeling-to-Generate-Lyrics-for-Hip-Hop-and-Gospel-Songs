I got the skully to my face (hardcore) 
 I got the skully to my face (hardcore) 
 Cause anything can happen at the Carnival 
 (Yo make room, make room, make room, MAKE ROOM, make room) 
 You can't stop the shining 
 Yo, don't slip Mike 
 You don't want to go there is all, trust me 
 I know your girl wit you, but you don't want to get embarrassed 
 Trust me 
 Yo, when you're rolling to the Carnival, anything can happen 
 What, what, say what, say what, anything can happen 
 Making love to your girlfriend, anything can happen 
 What? Say what, say what, anything can happen 
 She's sleepin' wit your best friend cause anything can happen 
 Wh-a-at? Say what, say what, anything can happen 
 You roll down the block, come back with your gat 
 And POW, cause anything can happen 
 Verse One: 
 Feel this composition, it's a brand new dub 
 First thing I did, was went to the pub 
 Tequila with worm, lemon, salt, and no rocks 
 'Cause when it hits my chest -- it gots to be hot 
 Uh haha, stop, 'Clef can I rock, yo 
 Get out the bathroom, let me go again from the top 
 Feel this composition, I wrote it in the tub 
 First thing I did, was went to the pub 
 Tequila with worm, lemon, salt, and no rocks 
 'Cause when it hits my chest -- it gots to be hot 
 Ah, stop, 'Clef can I rock 
 I'd like to give a shout out to my people on the block 
 For you Silly Willy playin' thug cartoon 
 My infrared scope got your movements on zoom 
 Boom new toon, write songs in my room 
 Sleeping with the bride, even though I ain't the groom 
 Your husband assume, come back with his goons 
 Put me in the trunk on your way to your honeymoon 
 Radio my platoon, Wyclef to Sev' 
 'I hear them playing Elvis, they on they way to Graceland 
 But they don't scare me, I'm in the trunk, I ain't sorry 
 Natural born killer, who slept with the enemy' 
 Think quick, what should I do, what did double-oh-seven do? 
 I pulled a bomb from my shoe (hahahahaha) 
 And exploded the trunk (blaooww) I woke up half drunk 
 Over looked by a bunch of gypsies wit a bag of skunk 
 You got the skully to your face, star, anything can happen 
 What, what, say what, say what, anything can happen 
 Sellin crack in the corner, man, anything can happen 
 What? Say what, say what anything can happen 
 I just got laid off, anything can happen 
 What, what, say what, say what, anything can happen 
 You don't wanna go there, cause anything can happen 
 What, what, say what, say what, anything can happen 
 Verse Two: 
 Aiyyo, anything can happen, you can't stop the shining 
 You lookin' at my watch, but my mind's really the diamond 
 Nine to the Seven, you better off steppin 
 When I'm writin with my pen, it turns into a lethal weapon (Ding!) 
 Take this lesson, to your next session 
 I suggest, you practice with the freshman 
 Sophomore, junior, then come check the senior 
 By then I would have graduated from the school of ruckus 
 Wyclef and Jerry Wonder, last of the producers 
 If the royalty ain't right, I put a call to Donny Eina 
 But always stay humble went from bummy to neat 
 Cause money break groups up like the Five Heartbeats 
 Don't get souped cause you, pushin a Coupe 
 Next year you on foot, runnin' from a lawsuit 
 For example, I know I'm nice, I don't front it 
 Least anticipated, to the most wanted 
 Yeah, that's me in the spotlight 
 With a mic and a guitar, like M.O.P., I like it raw 
 Yo, when you're rollin' to the Carnival, anything can happen 
 What, what, say what, say what, anything can happen 
 Every man got disciples, anything can happen 
 What, what, say what, say what, anything can happen 
 It's all about survival man, anything can happen 
 Hah, say what, say what, anything can happen 
 You lookin' at me wrong, man, anything can happen 
 What, what, say what, say what, anything can happen 
 Will the Knicks win the championship this year? 
 Say what, say what, anything can happen 
 Will we find some peace of mind this year? 
 Say what, say what, anything can happen 
 You ready for the revolution this year? 
 Say what, say what, anything can happen 
 Will you make love with no condom this year? 
 No no, no no, that will never happen 
 The record is not over yet 
 The record is not over yet 
 The record is not over yet 
 Where the ladies at? Put yo' hands in the air! 
 And for the ladies, we won't play you 
 If you proud, shake what yo mama gave you, hey! 
 Whether your fat or slim, bubble your ting 
 Fellas if you need help, use ginseng 
 And for the ladies, we won't play you 
 If you fat, shake what yo mama gave you, hey! 
 Whether your fat or slim, bubble your ting 
 ReFugee thugs hang at the roller rink 
 Roller skatin baby 
 Carnival (Make room, for the Carnival, make room) 
 And it don't, nine-seven to infinity 
 Rest in Peace, Rest in Peace 
 And the record is not over yet, the record is not over yet 
 It is not, the record (fades out)
