If you could see them 
 The bullet riddle brothers you thought were brave 
 The thugs, the gangstas 
 If you could hear them right now as they knock on heaven's door 
 They would tell you straight up 
 Stop the sh-t 
 The shootin, the bangin' 
 Too many tears 
 Too many wakes 
 Too many twenty-five to lifes 
 And wake up 
 They're up there right now talkin' to you in tongues of fire 
 For the love of life 
 Stop it 
 Yo, if you don't stop, I'm gonna get you before you get yourself
