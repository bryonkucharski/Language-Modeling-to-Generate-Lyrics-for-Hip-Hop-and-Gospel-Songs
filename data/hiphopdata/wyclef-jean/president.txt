Yeah... 
 Election time's coming 
 Who you gonna vote for? 
 Yeah 
 If I was president, 
 I'd get elected on Friday 
 Assasinated on Saturday, 
 Buried on Sunday 
 Then go back to work on Monday 
 If I was president 
 If I was president 
 If I was president, yeah 
 Instead of spending billions on the war 
 I can use that money 
 So I can feed the poor 
 'Cause I know some so poor 
 When it rains that's when dey shower 
 Screamin fight the power 
 That's when the vulture devours 
 If I was president, 
 I'd get elected on Friday 
 Assasinated on Saturday, 
 Buried on Sunday 
 Then go back to work on Monday 
 If I was president 
 If I was president 
 If I was president, yeah 
 I know some soldiers 
 That sleep but they can't dream 
 Wake up with screams 
 Sounds of M-16's 
 So take this medal of honor 
 For your bravery 
 I wish you the best kid 
 For you and your family 
 If I was president, 
 I'd get elected on Friday 
 Assasinated on Saturday, 
 Buried on Sunday 
 Then go back to work on Monday 
 If I was president 
 If I was president 
 If I was president 
 But the radio won't play this 
 Dey call it rebel music 
 How can you refuse it? 
 Children of Moses 
 Tell the children the truth, the truth 
 It's not all that bling that's diamonds 
 Tell them the truth, the truth 
 Most of y'all wear cubic zirconium 
 (Take it off now) 
 Tell them the truth, the truth, yeah 
 Your soul is worth more than diamonds and gold 
 (Rapped) 
 If I was president 
 All blacks would have reparation 
 No segregaton, feed the nation 
 So there's no famine, 
 Muslims, Jews, Christians 
 Would hold hands every week on the beach 
 Party by the sand, word up 
 Take trips on Air Force One 
 Don't need to bring the homeless 
 With no sneaks to Air Force One 
 Better schools in the 'hood 
 Better teachers for the classes 
 Making money, paying no taxes 
 Find the best scientists 
 Tell 'em to come up with an answer 
 I want the cure for AIDS and cancer 
 But I gotta watch my back 
 Snipers on the hill with the steel 
 Waiting at JFKill 
 If I was president, 
 I'd get elected on Friday 
 Assasinated on Saturday, 
 Buried on Sunday 
 Then go back to work on Monday 
 If I was president 
 If I was president 
 spoken: 
 I feel the rain coming, let me take out my guitar for them right now 
 Let's go 
 Refuguees!
