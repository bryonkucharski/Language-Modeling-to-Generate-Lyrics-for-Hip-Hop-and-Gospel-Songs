Yeah I wanna dedicate this to everybody that love hip hop music 
 Cause without hip hop music I wouldn't be here today 
 Preacher's son, yeah 
 Imagine if Biggie and Pac never got shot 
 And they both still were rulers of hip hop 
 And Puffy and Suge was roomates from college 
 And Big L never got found in the alley 
 Nas and Jay-Z they were still homies 
 Squash the beef with Ja Rule and 50 
 Benzino shook hands with Eminem 
 And on the same record I heard Eve, Fox and Kim 
 And sometimes when I dream, that's when I wake up 
 I kinda hoped that The Fugees didn't break up 
 And when they walked into the studio I prayed they didn't spray 
 'Cause I miss that scratch from Jam Master Jay (Whoa oh oh!) 
 Shots go off, mother's cry 
 Death since rise, homicide 
 Black on black crime needs to stop 
 Y'all can't blame it on hip hop 
 'Cause what we say is what we see 
 What we see is reality 
 The ghetto's the ghetto you got them livin' in sorrow 
 Soon they won't live to see tomorrow 
 Imagine if Big Pun was still alive 
 I could see Fat Joe screamin Terror Squad 
 Imagine if there were still four survivors still in Destiny's Child 
 And TLC never lost they Left Eye 
 Imagine Refugees never needin a passport 
 And John Forte never at Newark Airport 
 Million Man March, man, that was a start 
 Now I need a million more to meet me at Central Park 
 When the revolution start y'all 'gon have to play this 
 Imagine Slick Rick not gettin' deported (Whoa oh oh!) 
 Shots go off, mother's cry 
 Death since rise, homicide 
 Black on black crime needs to stop 
 Y'all can't blame it on hip hop 
 'Cause what we say is what we see 
 What we see is reality 
 The ghetto's the ghetto you got them livin' in sorrow 
 Soon they won't live to see tomorrow 
 In the club never though Shyne shot the gun 
 But in the limosine JLO had to run 
 Paparazzi snappin shots through the mirror 
 That's when I saw a smile from Princess Diana 
 Back and forth and forth and back 
 Like Miss Aaliyah man do I miss her 
 The war goes on with The ROC and The Lox 
 Murder INC, G- Unit it's a fight to the top 
 Stop! We lost too many soldiers like Freaky Tah 
 While they get the cover of a magazine who got to die 
 Shots go off, mother's cry 
 Death since rise, homicide 
 Black on black crime needs to stop 
 Y'all can't blame it on hip hop 
 'Cause what we say is what we see 
 What we see is reality 
 The ghetto's the ghetto you got them livin' in sorrow 
 Soon they won't live to see tomorrow 
 Yeah, peace be with y'all
