(Feat. Buju Banton & T-Vice) 
 Imma take you to a place 
 Where the trouble's I'm the base 
 Where everybody's fine 
 And ther's no color line 
 The only thing we see 
 Is the party by the sea 
 So lets call the refugee 
 Vole, Vole, Vole, Vole 
 Pompe, Pompe, Pompe, Pompe 
 Sote, Sote, Sote 
 Mete main nou anle. Met main nou anle (2 x's) 
 If you come from the Caribians 
 Lets show them how we do it 
 Throw your flagz in the air and wave it 
 Ladies while you shake it break it (2 x's)
