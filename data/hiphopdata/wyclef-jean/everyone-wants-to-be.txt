Everyone wants to be the cowboy living life the wild wild west style 
 Everyone wants to be the outlaw 
 Well everyone tough and no one is gonna back down 
 Everyone's tough and no one is gonna back down 
 Everyone wants to be the superstar live like a star and driving the fancy car 
 Everyone wants to get some fame playing the man's game 
 Everyone tough and no one is gonna back down 
 Capone said him tough and no one is gonna back down 
 Hey yo warning to informers and traitors first one die will be the instigator 
 Who died and left you commentator outer body experience see it's not all good 
 Look into the eyes of who was once Clint Eastwood 
 Fire koombaya for back up call Libya soldiers hold your fire I see Ethiopia 
 I hear you boast about who you toast around the coast 
 But once you hear the fire you vanish like human ghost sucker 
 Everyone wants to be the cowboy living life the wild wild west style 
 Everyone wants to be the outlaw 
 Well everyone's tough and no one is gonna back down 
 Everyone's tough and no one is gonna back down 
 Sandokas said him tough and no one is gonna back down 
 Jesse James said him rough and no one is gonna back down
