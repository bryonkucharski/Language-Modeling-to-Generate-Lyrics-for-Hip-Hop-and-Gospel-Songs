You should be rolling up by now 
 Knowing I'm a look 
 Cool in them 
 Black and white pictures 
 When they talk about 
 Underground rappers 
 Gettin' high and making history 
 I'm sick and tired these niggaz 
 Claiming they as sick as me 
 They lying I checked your chart 
 Your file saying you soft 
 Something fishy hoe nigga 
 You more bass then boss 
 Off the boat small fries 
 And stowaways get tossed 
 Can't party on the shore with us fool 
 Get yo floaties up, kiddy pool nigga 
 Ain't really that cool 
 Can't follow these moves 
 You need more expensive shoes 
 Working out smoking strong 
 On a week long cruise 
 Bonfire with theses bitches 
 Singing songs to the moon 
 Too high to judge 
 Call my ex bitch that did foul shit 
 Fuck her brains out and settle the grudge 
 Back shot revenge style, ain't no love 
 Light grub, roll up after a quick scrub 
 Cover my tracks don't let my bitch know where I was 
 Sticking to the script thought I'm improvising a bit 
 Same as my OG's but I put the Jets in the mix 
 Classic like Eddie Murphy's SNL skits 
 Dead stock tissue in the box elephant print 
 On my flint 13's, no retro 3m reflective 
 Ya bitch tight recklessing my DM's 
 Sexting tryna see him 
 Smoke a J where he being but I got no time for company 
 I'm building one of them hunny 
 I know that's why you want me, success is my cologne 
 I spray that bottle all on me, yeah, yeah jet life
