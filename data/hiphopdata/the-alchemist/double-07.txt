You should be rolling up by now 
 Shelter from the rain in a parked car 
 Chopping game, modifying my slangs 
 Fog lights in the grill, in the grill whipping the 96 [?] 
 (?) 
 My independence remain 'cause I ain't working for the radio station like Martin Payne 
 I grind and maintain my peace of mind almost lost it once on the line 
 Too see that I found it just in time, a mercenary killer 
 Paid for bringing death to these wack niggas 
 You call them raps that's why them labels never called you back 
 Pimpin', yeah jack, spitta snap, long flight, turbulence bad 
 Baggage claim tags car service rolling grass Double 07 
 But I ain't talking agents, 2 ounces and 7 grams my nigga we still blazing 
 You uneasy in my presence, dumb questions, dumb statements 
 I'm on a whole other level roof terrace you the basement 
 Couldn't gain possession them haters couldn't take it 
 Can't see me unless you sleeping nigga Freddy vs Jason 
 Snoozing on a JET movement, the worst nightmare in the making
