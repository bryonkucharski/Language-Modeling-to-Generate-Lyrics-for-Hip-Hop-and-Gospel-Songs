Huuuh 
 I call my brother Sun 'cause he shine like... noon time 
 My last on the turnpike, maneuvering minds GT5 My nerves is ice 
 And I wouldn't change none of it at hind sight, believe this 
 'Cause if I wouldn't have been that then I wouldn't be this 
 Inspiration for niggas who out there chasing that paper 
 Walkin' the walk, and running over them haters 
 Outlining the chalk, the conversation is deaded 
 'Cause I'm living for the loot 'n' you wasn't talkin' no bread biiitch 
 Cake all layerish, playa all himalayerish, got the 420 vision 
 Rollin' doobies up, rollin' doobies up, up in the incision 
 My rocket furnishes, projection screens built in my ceilings 
 I spit the picture so vivid because I'm really livin' 
 This jet life, tennis shoes 'n' tuxedos 
 Them other fools ain't fly, they fuckin' mosquitoes 
 Don't work, they just cryin, whinin, fuckin' pinot grigio 
 You need to get on your grind 
 Stack a stack of dead people, that concussive presidential time 
 For that cash I brung a clean tag, this is mine 
 Fuck you doin' with that dough 
 Az holdin' the baby, peepin the whole scene, I'm bout to blow 
 You know
