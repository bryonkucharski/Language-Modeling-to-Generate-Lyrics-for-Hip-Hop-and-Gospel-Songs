Lose your life 
 Yeah, what up? Snoopie D-O Dub 
 West coast kings, what's up, Alchemist? 
 I wanna holla real quick, man 
 'Cause see a lota these niggas got the game 
 Fucked up, man, they don't know, man 
 It's real seriously, it's heavy out in those streets, man 
 You could lose you're like that 
 You wanna lose your life 
 Play me, got a pocket and mah cock it and you might 
 You wanna lose your life 
 Niggas getting dropped and popped on the block every night 
 You wanna lose your life 
 Money is the key in the street life 
 You wanna lose your life 
 Walking 'round gang banging betta keep that thang hanging 
 20 lil missiles in the clip of the 5-7 
 I'm like navigation if you trying to find heaven 
 You already know I'm a rare breed 
 Sitting on a nice amount of acres and square feet 
 Yeah, see even the best die respect my 
 Colombian neck tie, you just can't pass death by 
 You can be homie 'cause neutral god body, neita, king Zulu 
 One thing about death it ain't gonna fool you 
 No reason to lie for nothing to prove too 
 Why you still here? Though the devil will use you 
 Closed casket is how I know the bullets abused you 
 Even though I'm a boss I like to eat food too 
 Spray a nigga block up when I'm in the mood too 
 Blow a blunt get a drink whatever soothes you 
 'Cause if it ain't the street the system will lose you 
 You wanna lose your life 
 Play me got a pocket and mah cock it and you might 
 You wanna lose your life 
 Niggas getting dropped and popped on the block every nightt 
 You wanna lose your life 
 Money is the key in the street life 
 You wanna lose your life 
 Walking 'round gang banging betta keep that thang hanging 
 Homie, listen to the flow let it take you where you're going 
 Billy Jean step over the track till it's glowing 
 You thinking I'm the O N E metaphors are no win 
 Avalanche P pushed powder till you snowed in 
 Open sesame unveil the recipe cocaine cook up, heroin and ecstasy 
 Got me locked in the coupe like the lambos arresting me 
 Gun play necessity war fare, none spared 
 Duffel bag money ain't all there we sick 'em all morning victim 
 He who test P just begging for the death walk with devilish me 
 Sit back kick back knowing that there's none hotter 
 Graduated from a drug dealer's alma-mater 
 Magna cum lauder, the kitchen I'm so jada 
 You niggas got no worries, hakuna matata 
 You wanna lose your life 
 Play me got a pocket and mah cock it and you might 
 You wanna lose your life 
 Niggas getting dropped and popped on the block every night 
 You wanna lose your life 
 Money is the key in the street life 
 You wanna lose your life 
 Walking 'round gang banging betta keep that thang hanging 
 (Incomprehensible) 
 Niggas getting dropped and popped on the block every night
