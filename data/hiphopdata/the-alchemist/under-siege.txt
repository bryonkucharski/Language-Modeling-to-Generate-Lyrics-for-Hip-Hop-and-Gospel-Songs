(Intro: Ohno) 
 All you motherfuckers 
 All you bitches 
 All you bitch ass niggas 
 Can't stand all you motherfuckers 
 Yeah 
 (Verse 1: Ohno) 
 Y'all fuckin' with some raw individuals 
 Smart criminals 
 Gangrene top of the pinnacle 
 Let it rule 
 Brittle you and your crew it's pitiful 
 I come through and burn like the sun do visible 
 Physical burn off ya skin 
 It's the critical interval between death and miracles 
 Miniscule is what y'all gots in options 
 My synopsis tells me y'all not this hotness 
 Ox shit 
 Move over here comes that bulldozer 
 I run niggas over pull off into the shoulder 
 Spine pulling they arms out of their shoulders 
 They commented wrong in the eyes of the beholder 
 Alarms off, neighborhood watchin over my shoulders 
 Frontline turn this vet back into a soldier 
 It's all over I'll break over the globe global 
 Then takeover with raw breaks and go postal 
 Tell your commissioner 
 Ya *scratch* 
 City under siege 
 (Verse 2: Alchemist) 
 On some Steven Seagal shit 
 Salmonella chicken I'm kickin that raw shit 
 For practice so when you snack on this you get nauseous 
 And vomit 
 I fly over the city and bomb it 
 And parachute down with the truth and strong arm it 
 Like Red Dawn 
 Fuck around and get stepped on 
 The word's out, all the buttons got pressed on 
 It's a hostile takeover 
 The break's over 
 I'm straight soldier 
 Fuck up your face like a makeover 
 When you step into the path of the tanks, get raced over 
 And flattened while I still got my stereo blasting 
 I'm a savage 
 Loco, my case is basket 
 Way beyond the point of no return I passed it 
 And I stole your gadgets 
 So I advise you not to open the baggage 
 My backpack is an explosive package 
 C4 plastic 
 Closed casket 
 It gets drastic in the street like I'm directin traffic
