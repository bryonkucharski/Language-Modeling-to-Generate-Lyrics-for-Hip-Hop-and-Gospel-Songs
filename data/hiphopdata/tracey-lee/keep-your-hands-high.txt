Tracey Lee f/ Notorious B.I.G. 
 Many Facez 
 (Notorious B.I.G.) 
 Fuck that, I preach it, my nine reaches 
 The prestigious cats who speak this Willie shit 
 Flood in pieces, my hand releases snatches 
 Smackin cabbage, half-ass rappers shouldn't have it 
 So I grab it, never run, the out come is usually 
 A beat down brutally, fuck who you be or where you from 
 West or East coast, squeeze toast leave most 
 In the blood they layin in, ask Tray and them 
 (Tracey Lee) 
 Oh shit, I suppose its time to go snitch 
 Flip a line and get the show lit 
 You clown niggaz hold it 
 Down your flow lax, just so you know that 
 We could battle for days like old cats 
 Black, you dealing with a throw back 
 Winnin' like straight jacks, with a wide range 
 Of rhyme teams, my lyrics they bang like migraines 
 Nigga my name, Tray the terrible 
 Philadelph, wild child incredible 
 Too sick for medical attention, people listen 
 It's verbal ascension, like Maxwell many dimensions 
 Flood over tracks, well, mics in critical condition 
 Killin' ya Maxell, unveil lyrical skills unknown 
 For my people with illegal cell phones 
 A real MC let's bring it back home 
 Live from the two-one-five, that lost a back bone 
 In charge, and heavily on like break fog 
 You for saw it, nigga stay down 
 Biggie make them hit the floor face down 
 (Notorious B.I.G.) 
 What, what, what, the rings and things you speak about 
 Bring 'em out, it's hard to yell with my bat round 
 In your mouth, its more than I expected 
 I thought them jewels was rented, but they wasn't 
 So run it, cousin, I could chill the heat does it 
 Ran up in your shell about a dozen, you never seen 
 Bank like Frank White, ya hand clutchin 
 Ya chest plate contemplates, bout to die nigga wait 
 Keep ya hands high 
 Chorus: repeat 2X 
 You don't wanna die, keep your hands high 
 Ain't no right or wrong in this game called survive 
 So you know it's Tray and B-I, G schemin on your cream 
 Why try, keep ya hands high 
 (Tracey Lee) 
 Hey yo it's show time, so I'ma blow nines into your spine 
 So what's yours is mine, you know what this is 
 Bag the Benjamins with all ya riches 
 How quickly, the milli turn Willies to bitches 
 Controllin your fate, a hole in your plate 
 Fuck the show dates, I want the whole state 
 With squads harassin, all of y'all niggaz who flashin 
 We doing this the Tray Lee way, delay 
 Then nigga we spray, ain't no ignoring us 
 Me and Notorious 
 (Notorious B.I.G.) 
 I got a new mouth to feed, I'm due south with keys 
 Y'all pick seeds out y'all weed, I watch cowards bleed 
 Motherfucker please, it's my block with my rocks 
 Fuck the hip-hop, them one-two's and it don't stop 
 Me and my nigga Lance, took him and Cease in vans 
 Bought ten bricks, four pounds of weed plants 
 From Branson, now we lamp in, twelve room mansions 
 Bitches get naked off Get Money, Playas Anthem 
 Don't forget One More Chance and, my other hits 
 Other shit niggaz spit be counterfeit 
 Robbing come naturally, in and out like fuckin' rapidly 
 Pass the gat to me 
 Make his chest rest where his back should be 
 Fuckin' blasphemy, blast me, your family rest in coffins 
 Often, Franquiza, far from soft or fragile, uh 
 Play hard like Reggie Miller, rapper slash dope dealer 
 Slash guerilla, slash illest turn iller 
 (Tracey Lee) 
 So nigga keep ya hands high 
 Run all your so called possessions, links with baguettes in 
 Keys to your Lex, for us to make your shorties dressed in 
 A full jack maneuver, don't no body move, just the moolah 
 It's RNF and Junior M.A.F., runnin' through ya like Kahlua 
 If rum sung then you fly, niggaz with the 45 
 But True Lies, but you brought out the real nigga in me 
 Now I'ma cock the semi, watch you strip like Demi
