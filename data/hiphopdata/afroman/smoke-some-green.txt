All the fellas roll a fat blunt and 
 Smoke some green, smoke some green, smoke some (green) 
 All the ladies rub on your cunt and 
 Smoke some green, smoke some green, smoke some (green) x2 
 Because I got high in this bitch 
 You can't see my burgundy eye in this bitch 
 T burg Mississippi p-dale in this bitch 
 T-shirt, cds for sell in this bitch 
 Inhale and get high, my my my 
 You need to give beer and marijuana a try 
 I ride thirteens and hit the three will switch 
 I'm from Eastside Palmdale Cali, Biaatch 
 Hungry Hustler records with the marijuana leaf 
 Still pimpin' poor bitchs even though we got beef 
 Get an ounce, Get an ounce 
 Now I'm about to smoke some green 
 Flick my ashes, drink my glasses, and I keep my clothes clean 
 Two or three hoes wanna pose with Afroman 
 Marijuana, malt liquor, butt cheeks in my hand 
 Real women groping me 
 Cheater haters scoping me 
 Cops know I got some liquor plus I got some dope on me 
 All the fellas roll a fat blunt and 
 Smoke some green, smoke some green, smoke some (green) 
 All the ladies rub on your cunt and 
 Smoke some green, smoke some green, smoke some (green) x2 
 First my head start ta spin then my beer cup falls 
 Falls on all y'all. Oh shit ah nah 
 Started slapping hoe bitch 
 Took that bitch to berlin 
 Told that bitch to suck my dick till the fucking world ends 
 All my homies got some bitches 
 All them bitches bring me riches 
 Put them riches in my britches 
 Leave them bitches in some ditches 
 Beers, blunts, bag of weed 
 Everything a brother need 
 No stems no seeds roll it up with speed 
 Palmdale cali anti-dope alley 
 So much weed my house look like a galley 
 I'm never on MTV, I'm never on BET 
 I talk too much about W-EED 
 Love me a sugar bear, great big derriere, 
 Real long pretty hair, marijuana everywhere 
 Ride cross country, smokin' in the country 
 At the waffle house *chicken* I got the muchies 
 All the fellas roll a fat blunt and 
 Smoke some green, smoke some green, smoke some (green) 
 All the ladies rub on your cunt and 
 Smoke some green, smoke some green, smoke some (green) x2
