I wanna say uh hustle up to all the hustlas out there, I love you man 
 I've been hustlin 
 From dusk till dawn 
 I've been hustlin 
 For so long 
 I'm the hungry hustla afroman I recycle cardboard, beer bottles, and cans 
 Food stamps, bust token plus G.R. checks, underground rap tapes tryin' to 
 Get on deck 
 Hit the rap contest sellin weed on stage, 
 Go to work for the man for minimum wage, 
 Slave hard, grave yard, every day get scard, 
 Airport, fast food, security guard. 
 Slangin rocks all day 
 Let my beeper just beep 
 Go to work go high, go strait to sleep 
 Wake up, bake up, then punch them clocks 
 Swerve them blocks, serve them rocks 
 Workin at the airport with Jivonni and Kid 
 Slangin everything the airport bring in 
 Cook crack sip yak stack cheese 
 Walk around sell my own CD's. 
 I've been hustlin (24-7,365) 
 From dusk till dawn (all my life just tryna survive) 
 I've been hustlin (food stamps bus token plus G.R. check 
 For so long (underground rap tapes tryna get on deck) 
 I've been Hustlin Dusk till dawn (swerve them rocks)

 Ghetto resident everyday get bent 
 With the 2 tall cans for 89 cent 
 Get money get fame get women get props 
 Chillin' kick it with my homies rippin rocks from the cops 
 Walk slow around the corner then dash hall ass 
 If you run, run fast 'cause the cops might blast 
 Run, Shake, Break, bail 
 Might as well 'cause it's hell in the county jail 
 Cut to the left (left) Cut to the right (right) 
 Run up in the house shut the door goodnight 
 Come back out bout 20 minutes later 
 Braggin to the homies how I shook that hater 
 Start back hangin' start back slangin 
 Rappin', sangin, system bangin' 
 Ain't got no job ain't got no credit 
 But whatever you need I'll get it 
 I've been hustlin (24-7,365)

 Afro motha fuckin' M A N 
 Tryna go to the top 
 Not the federal pen 
 But I'm in the ghetto 
 My problems won't let me go 
 Until I go get some dough 
 Only legal things 
 I can do for snaps 
 Is program beats 
 And bust husla raps 
 Made my first CD started slanging it 
 The boys in the hood started bangin' it 
 But I couldn't get rich on my side of town 
 So I jumped in the cadilac and moved around 
 To the ??Slathlaswane?? ??Kathaswalne?? 
 Even goddinna tell me have you seen her 
 Dude named afroman from Palmdale 
 Sellin CD's in front of Sell-u-tell 
 Rap contest, partys, clubs, and bars, 
 From a homeless bum to the grammies with stars
