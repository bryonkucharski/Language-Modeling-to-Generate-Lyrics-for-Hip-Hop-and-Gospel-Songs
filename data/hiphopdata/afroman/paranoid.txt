 Aiight 
 How long can sell? 
 (You see life is like football you know what I'm saying) 
 Before I have to go to jail 
 (You gotta hike the ball and just make something happen man) 
 Can I possibley get real? 
 (I mean you know you might get tackeled you know what I'm saying) 
 Before somebody go and snitch 
 (Then again you might fuck around and make a touch down) 
 I'm so paranoid stressed stressed paranoid paranoid 
 One false move I can be destroyed (echo) 
 I avoid the cops I use a decoy 
 See my mother fuckin' driver he's a white boy 
 I'm so paranoid stressed stressed paranoid paranoid one false move 
 I can be destroyed to avoid the cops I use a decoy 
 You see my mother fuckin' driver he's a white boy 
 All my life I did nothin' but dealin' 
 Learned to rely on my gut feelin' 
 Yo name is what? what? I know you from where? where? 
 I don't meen to seem vicious but you look suspicious 
 Stop talking bout drugs on the telephone 
 Stop walking with a bunch of thugs to my home 
 Stop fuckin' up, call me before you come 
 Stop telling these bitches where you got it from 
 How long can I sell 
 The sheriff departments right down the block 
 Before I have to go to jail 
 Pass my beer so I can swallow this rock 
 Can I possibley get real 
 Pass the tabs the turnakit and syringes 
 Before somebody go snitch 
 Before the DEA kick the door of the hinges 
 I'm so paranoid stressed stressed paranoid pranoid 
 One false move I can be destroyed (echo) 
 I avoid the cops I use a decoy 
 You see my mother fuckin' driver he's a white boy 
 I'm so paranoid stressed stressed paranoid paranoid 
 One false move I can be destroyed (echo) 
 I avoid the cops I use a decoy 
 You see my mother fuckin' driver he's a white boy 
 As I bail down the street with my khakis creased 
 Everybody looking at me look like the police 
 Havin' conversations with my gang asailants 
 Do you think we under police surveilance 
 Asking questions giving suggestions 
 Pulling smith an wessons on strange pedestrians 
 Cookin crack up, dolla bills stacked up 
 Hope the cops don't backup here they come man 
 How long 
 Stop runnin' stop runnin' 
 Can I sell 
 The sheriff departments right down the block 
 Before I have to go to jail 
 Pass my beer so I can swallow this rock 
 Can I possibly get real 
 Hurry up pass the tabs turnakit and syringes 
 Before somebody go and snitch 
 Before the DEA kick the door off the hinges 
 Maybe I otta stop sellin water 
 Spend more time with my son and my daughter 
 But my drug life drug me away from my wife 
 She couldn't deal with the stress and the strife 
 The cocaine rockin' and the hood rats jockin' 
 The late night knockin' the drive way blockin' 
 Late at night I fantasize bout rappin' 
 But I gotta sell dope till it happen 
 For how long 
 Hey who is that who is that man? 
 See you all fuckin' up 
 I got these looks 
 Yo man little rich kids comin' over here 
 That's what I'm saying now 
 You know the gonna snitch 
 They can't even lie to there parents 
 What the fuck you think they gonna do when the police presure em? 
 Get to crying and shit... afroman sold it to me mommy 
 He stays over there 
 How long can I sell 
 The sheriff departments right down the block 
 Before I have to got to jail 
 Pass my beer so iI can swallow this rock 
 Can I possibley get real 
 Pass the tabs turnakit and syringes 
 Before somebody go and snitch 
 Before the DEA kick the door of the hinges 
 I'm so paranoid 
 Now god lay me down to sleep 
 Before the cops rape 
 Please give me a beat 
 If they accidentally kill me 
 And I don't escape 
 Pray some white person 
 Gotta video tape 
 Twinkle twinkle little little star (echo) 
 That looks like a police car (echo) 
 Shining on my dope spot (echo) 
 A police raid (echo) 
 I hope not (echo) 
 Little little homie hold my gun (echo) 
 I'm gonna fuckin' run (echo) 
 Where I run, I don't care 
 Throw that dope, anywhere (echo) 
 Cops chase me, through the hood 
 Straight in to the woods camera 
 Fly like leapords 
 I hear, German sheapards 
 Freeze, hold It right there 
 Drug dealers, nightmare 
 Busted crack, criminal court 
 No black support 
 Handcuffs very tight, baptist jury all white 
 They could never, be my peers, sentence me twenty years 
 This rap so damn real, I'm glad I gotta record deal 
 If I don't sell a mill 
 This could could happen still 
 What a predicament
