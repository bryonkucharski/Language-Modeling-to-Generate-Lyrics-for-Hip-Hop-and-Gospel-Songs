 There go thAT Homie Big DRAWERS 
 HUSS UPP Hustler! 
 (Talking and shizz) 
 Limpin' through the hood with my kakis saggin 
 The bottom of my pants toe back from draggin 
 I'm not a handicap but I like to limp 
 Life's a bitch and I'm a Palmdale pimp 
 Limpin' down the street to the gangster beat 
 Lean to the side and grab my meat 
 I don't walk, I stroll brother 
 Afroman is a soul brother 
 I'm young, but I'm from the old school 
 Always hang around old fools 
 Lean to the side as I stride 
 I can't hide my hustler pride 
 When I walk that walk and talk that talk 
 They sport my clothes, Break them hoes 
 Hey Ladies 
 Afroman is from the 80's 
 Keep on Limpin' 
 Down the street 
 Keep on Limpin' 
 To the beat 
 (4 times) 
 Limp when you sing, limp when you rap 
 Hold your leg straight, bend your kneecap 
 Put a glide in your stride, dip in your hip 
 Be cool fool, when you clock your grip 
 You can limp fast, you can limp slow 
 However you limp, limp to the tempo 
 When I was, thirteen years old 
 Some boys in the hood taught me how to stroll 
 My homie TooTall said "what up G"? 
 Walk to the liqour store 
 And walk like me 
 I did it wrong and I did it right 
 I did it all day, I did it all night 
 I used to practice in my room 
 In my mirror, to the sound of the stereo boom 
 The very next day I walked to school 
 And grown women told me "you so cool" 
 Power to the people - right on 
 The sheriff hit the block 
 Turned the spotlight on 
 The skinny black boy called Afroman 
 Rollin' through South Central 
 With my dick in my hand 
 (More Talking and shizz) 
 Four things I like, about a pimp 
 The way he dress, the way he limp 
 That clean, unique car that he drives 
 And the cool ass way he talk and jive 
 Even when he get locked up in jail 
 He hop out his cell and begin to bail 
 All the homeboys locked in the pen 
 Limp down the hall for me once again 
 You can take my freedom, put me in the hole 
 But even in the hole - I'm'a hit my stroll 
 (Talk, talk, talk)
