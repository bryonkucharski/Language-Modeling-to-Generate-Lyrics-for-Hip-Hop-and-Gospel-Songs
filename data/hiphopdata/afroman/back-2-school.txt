Man my daddy told me, boy when I was your age, 
 I had to walk 13 miles to school 
 I said, Oh, is that why you didn't graduate? 
 Talkin' noise with all of my homeboys 
 Then we go back to school, yeah (Her titties bigger than they were last summer, know what I'm sayin'?) 
 With a mouthful of beer and a noseful of weeeeeed 
 You know I been act a fool, yeah 
 Mama, (Mama), go to the University of Smoking Marijuana (What?) 
 All of my friends go to USC, so I'm gonna tag along and hit the bong with them 
 Walkin' through the masses, lookin' for my classes 
 I can't concentrate on the teacher, surrounded by titties and asses 
 Spend a lot of money on some brand new clothes 
 Tryin' to impress these brand new hoes 
 Laugh every time I have sex with a chick, 
 Baby don't know I'm an ex-convict 
 Walkin' round the campus with my fro on pick 
 Every twenty seconds I'll be grabbin' my dick 
 Full of alcohol at the football games 
 Doin' more drugs than my nigga Rich James 
 My GPA's droppin' at a very fast rate 
 It would take a miracle for me to graduate 
 Maybe I won't, maybe I will 
 Stressed out, poppin' pills in my Coupe Deville 
 How do I party (party) and still pass 
 I hardly (hardly) ever go to class 
 Got a golden eagle on my stolen Regal 
 If you bought it from me, it's illegal 
 'Cause I'm Afroman, the educated crip 
 On a rock cocaine scholarship 
 Cook that crack until it's done 
 I use that for my Negro college fund 
 Broke minorities, sellin' dope to those bitches in sororities 
 She's drinkin' one too many 40's 
 She took her clothes off, now we're havin' orgys 
 Baby I don't mean to act rude, 
 But you told me you would never fuck a black dude 
 Colt 45 must have got you in the mood, 
 To eat a fat dick like sum soul food 
 Hey fellas, can I get jiggy with it? 
 Hey check this shit out right here, 
 Hey homeboy, don't stress, 
 I got the answers to the test, 
 My college professor smokes a lot of grass, 
 She's gonna make sure we pass, 
 That's how you pass trigonometry, 
 Sell dope to your teacher, use niggernometry 
 On the microphone, there's not a rapper bomb as me, 
 And when the police pushin, nobody's calm as me 
 Wait a minute, you know what's fucked up 
 Black people in college act stuck up 
 So self-concsious, and insecure, 
 You wanna speak back, but you really ain't sure 
 Look at me, what do you see? 
 You see the OG you ashamed to be 
 So fuck you, you pretty little rich frat boy, 
 You can suck my dick just like that boy 
 I said honey, (honey), you got some sexy looks, 
 You need money (money), to buy your textbooks 
 Get it wet, and I can get it hard, 
 We can slide your vaginal credit card 
 Computer girl, come to my house and be my tutor girl, 
 Before we study, can we smoke a little Buddha, girl? 
 Raise your shirt, lick the nipples on your hooters, girl 
 Open up your legs, baby your the girl 
 Stick out your tongue and let me shoot it, girl 
 You was playin' with my floppy, then my hard drive downloaded, 
 Down your thoat, and fuckin' exploded 
 Tell your prejudice dad and mom, 
 To email their comments to suck my dick.com 
 Afro's the bomb, blowin' up like Vietnam
