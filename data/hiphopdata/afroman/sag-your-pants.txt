Let it go 
 Wha, c'mon 
 Somebody say hey 
 I'm just playin' 
 Before Palmdale, we use to stay 
 Deep in the hood where they sell yay 
 I seen a gangbanger walk by real fast 
 Brand new khakis hangin' off his ass 
 At first, I didn't like the chump 
 'Cause he looked like he needed to go take a dump 
 But everybody sag in the hood 
 Pretty soon, it started lookin' good 
 1987 I started stoppin' my mama from doin' my school shoppin' 
 Mama, love you right 
 But these wranglers too dam tight 
 Stay home, cook something to eat 
 Daddy, take me to the SWAP meet 
 Walkin' through the SWAP meet wit a jerri curl 
 Tryn to get somethin' from the home girl 
 Joseph, I love you right 
 But them wranglers is too dam tight 
 Okay ima give you a chance 
 But first... 
 Sag yo pants 
 Do that gangsta dance 
 Walk, walk, walk, walkowww 
 Who invited saggin, take a guess 
 I don't know but he from the west 
 Remember them old school rappers right 
 Like run dmc, they pants was tight 
 Don't get me wrong, I luv N. W.A. 
 But they wasn't saggin the right way 
 Saggin come from the L.A. streets 
 SWAP meets, old school beats 
 Move to the suburbs of Palmdale 
 Kept on saggin hard as hell 
 Had a cool step, plus a bad rep 
 Didn't fit in with the preppy prep 
 They crack little jokes, look down they nose 
 But now they smoke weed and wear baggy clothes 
 Play rap music, dance and drink beer 
 Shit we been doin' for years 
 Sag yo pants 
 Do that gangsta dance 
 Walk, walk, walk, walkowww 
 I sag my daddy, I sag my mama 
 I got to bed and sag my pajama 
 Sag at home, sag in church 
 Sag wit the homies in the police search 
 Sag at work, sag at school 
 Sag in the airport fool 
 Sag when I stayin, sag when I bail 
 Sag when I out the county jail 
 Sag in the SWAP meet, sag in court 
 Sag when I hop out the super sport 
 Sag when I'm playin' basket ball 
 "Pull yo pants up joey" hell naw 
 Sag wit my kids, sag wit my wife 
 I can't stop saggin, ima sag for life 
 Fist Palmdale sager, I don't bang 
 But I still let, my khakis hang 
 Sag bold, sag nervous 
 Sag when I'm doin' community service 
 Sag when I mac, sag when I brawl 
 I bet ya my pants don't fall 
 Sag yo pants 
 Do that gangsta dance 
 Walk, walk, walk, walkowww 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Pull 'em up, pull 'em up, pull 'em down B-CAAA 
 Ooowww yeeaa 
 Let me get them size 46, yeah B-CAAAA
