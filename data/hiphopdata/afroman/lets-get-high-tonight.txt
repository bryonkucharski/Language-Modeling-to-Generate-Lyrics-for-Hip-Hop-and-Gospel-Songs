Let's get drunk today 
 Let's get high tonight 
 Maybe in the morning 
 Things will be alright 
 I am living under 
 So much stress and chock (?) 
 Sometimes I stop and wonder 
 How to enjoy my life 
 Hanging with my homies 
 Talking yaah (?) 
 Smoking marijuana, drinking Cult 45 
 Hey homeboy, let's get drunk today 
 Let's get drunk today 
 Let's get high tonight 
 Maybe in the morning 
 Things will be alright 
 I am living under 
 So much stress and chock (?) 
 Sometimes I stop and wonder 
 How to enjoy my life 
 Bumping my music very loud 
 Limping down the sidewalk so high 
 Slap my brother, let's get drunk tonight 
 Let's get drunk today 
 Let's get high tonight 
 Maybe in the morning 
 Things will be alright 
 I am living under 
 So much stress and chock (?) 
 Sometimes I stop and wonder 
 How to enjoy my life 
 Now I'm nice and tipsy 
 And I'm high-igh 
 Flirting with the ladies 
 Walking by-ie-ie 
 Hey pretty lady, let's hook up tonight 
 Let's get drunk today 
 Let's get high tonight 
 Maybe in the morning 
 Things will be alright 
 I am living under 
 So much stress and chock (?) 
 Sometimes I stop and wonder 
 How to enjoy my life 
 Buckaa! (chicken sound :P)
