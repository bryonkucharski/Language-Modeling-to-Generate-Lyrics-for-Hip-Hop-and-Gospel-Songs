(Laughing) 
 Yeah, 
 Comeon Homeboy, Turn it up 
 Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh Buch-ach x2 
 Afroman, Double H, Double C 
 Double OG, Checking in the double tree 
 Colt 45, No Bubbley 
 Cops give me trouble, but they still don't trouble me 
 Hit the lights, read my rights 
 Fly somewhere, anywhere, anywhere, I really don't care 
 Run up in the club, grab me a woman (Oh) 
 Waitress keep them drinks 'a coming (burp) 
 Hah, easy come easy go, fuck what you talking bout? 
 I don't know, Shut up bitch, I'm in my own zone 
 Turn the music up, and leave me alone 
 Put your hands up if you're with me (ooh) 
 Tell the bartender, 'a hit me (Buch-ach!) 
 Take shots to the head, pick 'em up, put 'em down (uh) 
 You know tomorrow morning, your head's gonna pound (Oh) 
 But tonight, since you don't care, put your beer bottle in the air 
 The hungry hustler, Afroman, That fool Raule 
 Fatso and Matt Payne, Drinking brew 
 Drinking brew, taking blunts to the brain 
 Palms in the air, 'cause it's a Palmdale thang 
 Everybody in the crowd, put your beer in the air (uh) 
 If you're real short, stand up in a chair (uh) 
 If you ain't quite, fucked up yet, smoke you a newport cigarette 
 Keep a beer, in your hand, take a swig every chance you can 
 If you feel the urge, go ahead and burp, chill for a minute 
 Then take a slurp, Drink slow homie, don't want the bottle 
 To get all foamy, moving, grooving, jumping around 
 Bottle in the air, chugging it down. 
 Take shots to the head, pick 'em up, put 'em down (uh) 
 You know tomorrow morning, your head's gonna pound (Oh) 
 But tonight, since you don't care, put your beer bottle in the air 
 Throw it in the trash, drop it on the ground 
 Stagger to the bar, get another round 
 If you got alot of money, than share 
 I'm sure another alcoholic will care 
 Smoke a sweet, to the beat, if it's good 
 Put it on the beat, gotta have alot fun before you get too old 
 Lock the door, to your room, drown everybody out with the boom 
 Stereo blasting loud as hell, cellphone calls go to your voicemail 
 Take a little time out for yourself 
 Cause Afroman is good for your health 
 Take shots to the head, pick 'em up, put 'em down (uh) 
 You know tomorrow morning, your head's gonna pound (Oh) 
 But tonight, since you don't care, put your beer bottle in the air
