Dashing through these hos 
 Cadillac's and sixty 'fo's 
 On three wheels we go 
 Clocking lots of doe 
 Cellphone ringtone ring 
 My song "because I got high" 
 Smoking weed while I watch 
 The police flying by! 
 Oh, jinglebell, east palmdale jobe is back and not whack 
 Ooh found your daughter and you finally caught 'er and you mad 'cause I'm black 
 Ahaha I fucked her good, just like I should, I think I blew her balloon 
 I didn't use a condom and now we have a problem, she havin' my baby in June (Say what?!) 
 I know this holiday hooker 
 I think her name is Jan 
 And if you 'ain't got no money (Hell yeah) 
 She's got a layaway plan 
 I got a blowjob from her friend 
 I think her name is gwen 
 My dick plugged up her mouth 
 She couldn't get no oxygen! 
 Oh jinglebell, county jail, jobe's from the hood 
 Skinny women suck my dick real good but their butt cheeks feel like wood (Ouch!) 
 I be swimmin, in big fat women, when I'm in the sack (Ooh!) 
 Why have a skinny little bicycle bitch when I can ride a cadillac?! 
 I met this beautiful woman, she said she was Hawaiian 
 She said she didn't like black guys, however she was lyin' 
 She'd seen my go detonas, all my coupes and cash 
 She licked my hairy balls, like chocolate coconuts! 
 Oh, jinglebell, shotgun shell, sheriff got a gun 
 He pulled the trigger, shot that nigger look at that mo' fucka run! 
 Hit 'em in the head kicked him in the ass, put a kneecap in his chest 
 Went to the court, and told the judge, "This man was resisting arrest!"
