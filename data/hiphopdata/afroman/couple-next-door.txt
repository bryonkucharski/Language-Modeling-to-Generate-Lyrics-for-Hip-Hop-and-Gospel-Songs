Hahahaha, yeah 
 Just move from side to side 
 C'mon y'all 
 I can't sleep at night 
 Cause the couple next door just fuss and fight 
 But when the night's over and it's daylight 
 They hug and kiss and everything's all right 
 Head, shoulders, feet, and toes 
 Scratched up knee caps and elbows 
 Every night, they duckin blows 
 But they still together and that's how it goes 
 This is a story of Jack and Jill 
 No, not the ones who went up the hill 
 I mean a couple lovers that live next door 
 They always fightin, and I keep the score 
 They be pettin and pokin 
 Jabbin and jokin 
 Coo'in and crackin' 
 Moo'in and whackin 
 Neckin and knockin' 
 Sangin and sockin 
 Squakin and squeezin 
 Burnin and freezin 
 He holds her hand, long as he able 
 But when he lets her go, she bops him with a table 
 Pattin and pinchin 
 Cloutin and clenchin 
 Havin' theyself a good tiiime 
 I can't sleep at night 
 Cause the couple next door just fuss and fight 
 But when the night's over and it's daylight 
 They hug and kiss and everything's all right 
 Head, shoulders, feet, and toes 
 Scratched up knee caps and elbows 
 Every night, they duckin blows 
 But they still together and that's how it goes 
 Reverend Green thought he called one day 
 On this nice newly-wed across the way 
 But just as the pastor knocked on the door 
 A right connected and he hit the floor 
 They was pettin and poppin' 
 Bangin' and boppin 
 Coo'in and kissin' 
 Hittin and missin' 
 Groovin and grievin 
 Lovin' and leavin' 
 Kickin and cacklin 
 Ticklin and tacklin 
 My other neighbor tried to intervention 
 But one jab knocked out his good intentions 
 They was stewin and stabbin 
 Jivin and jabbin 
 Havin' theyself a good tiiime 
 I can't sleep at night 
 Cause the couple next door just fuss and fight 
 But when the nights over and it's daylight 
 They hug and kiss and everything's all right 
 Head, shoulders, feet, and toes 
 Scratched up knee caps and elbows 
 Every night, they duckin blows 
 But they still together and that's how it goes 
 A lion escaped from a circus train 
 Strayed in Jack and Jills domain 
 They got in a towering rage 
 The lion took a look and jumped back in the cage 
 They was swattin and swayin 
 Plottin and playin' 
 Stompin and stabbin 
 Groovin and grabbin 
 Dancin and duckin 
 Trippin' and truckin 
 Plottin and pleadin 
 Bangin' and bleedin 
 Her mama said "I'll go fetch her!" 
 But mama came out ridin' on a stretcher 
 They was hittin and holdin' 
 Faintin and foldin 
 Havin' theyself a good tiiime 
 I can't sleep at night 
 Cause the couple next door just fuss and fight 
 But when the night's over and it's daylight 
 They hug and kiss and everything's all right 
 Head, shoulders, feet, and toes 
 Scratched up knee caps and elbows 
 Every night, they duckin blows 
 But they still together and that's how it goes 
 One day a reporter interviewed the wife 
 Try'na get some data on her hectic life 
 She said that she never had time for books 
 She was too busy, duckin left hooks 
 Swattin and swingin' 
 Sockin and singin' 
 Cuttin' and cuddlin 
 Messin and muddin 
 Fondle and fussin 
 Kissin' and cussin 
 Tippin and teasin 
 Squattin and squeezin 
 The cop said "Stop! I'm the law!" 
 Too bad he couldn't stop that right to the jaw 
 They was jivin and jumpin' 
 Thrivin and thumpin 
 Havin' theyself a good tiiime 
 I can't sleep at night 
 Cause the couple next door just fuss and fight 
 But when the nights over and it's daylight 
 They hug and kiss and everything's all right 
 Head, shoulders, feet, and toes 
 Scratched up knee caps and elbows 
 Every night, they duckin blows 
 But they still together and that's how it goes 
 That's how it goes
