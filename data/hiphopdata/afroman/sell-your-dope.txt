A few words of inspiration 
 This song is dedicated to hustlers standing on the curb 
 Smokin' herb, movin weight from the inner city to the suburbs 
 Paranoid of jail, pocket full of YAYO, just waitin on another sale 
 Sip your beer wipe your tears encourage your peers it's gonna be all right 
 Everything is gonna be all right sell your dope make your money every night 
 Them brothers around the corner they wanna start a fight 
 SELL YOUR DOPE keep on hustlin till your moneys right 
 You and your girl argue every night sell 
 Your dope especially when your pockets tight 
 You can't find a job 'cause your skin ain't white 
 Sell your dope brother you know this world ain't right 
 Hey whattup lil inchworm 
 I hope this letter make you feel just a lil bit better 
 Got your t-shirt picked your khakis creased 
 So you can be g'd up when you get released 
 Me and my homeboys put together some Jimmys 
 To buy some beer and a couple of strippers 
 You can use my car till you find another 
 Can't wait till you get home but later on 
 That money you get from your GR check 
 Should be enough to put you back on deck 
 Now I know you on parole but don't be scared 
 This time we be prepared 
 Fuck the feds don't say shit to your broad 
 Keep your dope stashed in your neighbors yard 
 When they kick in the door with they steel toed boot 
 Won't find nothin' but a lawsuit, baby baby 
 Everything is gonna be aright SELL YOUR DOPE 
 Make your money every night 
 Them brothers around the corner they wanna start a fight 
 SELL YOUR DOPE keep on hustlin till your moneys right 
 You and your girl argue every night 
 Sell your dope especially when your pockets tight 
 You can't find a job 'cause your skin ain't white 
 Sell your dope brother you know this world ain't right 
 Your baby momma she might trip 
 'Cause you hangin' with a Crip tryin' to clock your grip 
 She can't help a black man out 
 But when bills come around she's got her hand out 
 The baby needs pampers and Similac... 
 Plus you need rims for your Cadillac 
 Ignore your girl when she starts trippin' 
 Keep them kilos flippin Dayton's dipin 
 We can expand by a little land 
 Hand the dope game down to the next man 
 Buy a little business clean the money 
 Look at the cops funny hey hey hey 
 Frontin in your caddy or a beat up Taurus 
 Got the baby gangsters sellin shit for us 
 We can dance underwater and not get wet 
 Sell crack on the internet but not yet 
 Everything is gonna be aright SELL YOUR DOPE 
 Make your money every night 
 Them brothers around the corner they wanna start a fight 
 SELL YOUR DOPE keep on hustlin till your moneys right 
 You and your girl argue every night 
 Sell your dope especially when your pockets tight 
 You can't find a job 'cause your skin ain't white 
 Sell your dope brother you know this world ain't right 
 Them brothers around the corner they wanna start a fight 
 SELL YOUR DOPE keep on hustlin till your moneys right 
 You and your girl argue every night 
 Sell your dope especially when your pockets tight 
 You can't find a job 'cause your skin ain't white 
 Sell your dope brother you know this world ain't right 
 1, 2, 3, 4 breakdown 
 (Singing and talking) 
 Early in the morning when I get outta bed 
 I chop up some quarter pieces and get ready for my cluck heads 
 I sell it all day baby I sell it all night long 
 Till the 15th comes around and everybody is all gone 
 I go out and buy some activator turn my fro into a jheri curl 
 Put the Daytona's on my lac and then I go scoop up my little girl 
 Baby don't try to change me if I go to the pen 
 'Cause when the white man lets me go I'm gonan do the same old thing again 
 Everything is gonna be aright SELL YOUR DOPE 
 Make your money every night 
 Them brothers around the corner they wanna start a fight 
 SELL YOUR DOPE keep on hustlin till your moneys right 
 You and your girl argue every night 
 Sell your dope especially when your pockets tight 
 You can't find a job 'cause your skin ain't white 
 Sell your dope brother you know this world ain't right
