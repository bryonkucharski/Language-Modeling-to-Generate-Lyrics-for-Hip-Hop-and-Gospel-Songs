:b 
 I quit my job this mornin' 
 I don't want to work no more 
 Fuck MacDonald's and Taco Bell, 
 That modern day slavery is knockin' on my front door 
 (I don't fit in the corporate world man) 
 Get you a big fat sack o' yayo 
 Can't see my kids can't see my wife 
 Can't see a way to control my dog-on life 
 Hungry hustlas 
 (Afroman) 
 Got hired at the dope spot 
 I'm an employee 
 Cookin' crack like a black Chef Boyardee 
 Got Meth, speed, whatever you need 
 Zigzags come free wit a bag of weed 
 If You want some sure, go talk to her 
 The skinny black dude wit the real long perm 
 Laptop computers, rap CDs, Motorola phones, Sony color TVs 
 Got the porno tapes in the back of the car, get it free when you buy a hot VCR 
 Got gats and D's, car batteries 
 Getting money with my folks on a hundred spokes 
 Cops ain't waiters, we don't tip em 
 Treat cars like women take 'em home and strip em 
 Match the pink slips, get the smog inspection 
 Put a add in the paper in the classified section 
 Cause' I don't want to work no more 
 (Fuck that shit) 
 Modern day slavery knocking on my front door 
 (Fuck that shit) 
 Can't see my kids can't see my wife, 
 Can't see a way to control my own life 
 'Cause I don't want to work no more 
 Modern day slavery knockin' on my front door 
 Can't see my kids can't see my wife, 
 Can't see a way to control my damn life, motherfucker 
 (Melody) 
 I quit my job this morning' 
 I don't want to work no more 
 Fuck MacDonald's and Taco Bell, 
 Modern day slavery is knocking on my front door 
 Get you a big fat sack of yayo 
 Can't see my kids can't see my wife 
 Can't see a way to control my dog-on life 
 Tell the Neighborhood watch, tell the Neighborhood listen 
 Tell the neighborhood ya big screen television missin' 
 New in my hood, I got to come to ya 
 Steal ya car battery and sell it back to ya 
 Then I come back, just for kicks 
 I leave ya car sitin' on four big bricks 
 All I need now is some vascus homes, 
 Cause my garage looks just like auto zone 
 What you say man? Ya need another beeper? 
 Buy from me, 'cause it's a whole lot cheaper 
 Got a cellular phone, and ya really oughta get it 
 Fo a limited time, brother, the chip come wit it 
 So come to my house, when the times is hard 
 It's just like Vegas in my back yard 
 I keep my Afro pick, my khakis creased, 
 And my next-door neighbors callin up the police 
 Cause' I don't want to work no more 
 Modern day slavery knockin' on my front door 
 Can't see my kids can't see my wife, 
 Can't see a way to control my own life 
 I said cause' I don't want to work no more 
 Modern day slavery knockin' on my front door 
 Can't see my kids can't see my wife, 
 Can't see a way to control my damn life 
 (Melody) 
 Rough, reckless, snatch yo necklace, 
 Sell it on the corner and buy myself breakfast 
 I made in an hour or more, 
 So what the fuck do I want to get job for? 
 So the yuppies the guppies, can floss their power 
 My black ass five dollas an hour 
 And the fact is, after taxes, got to live 
 Where the Mexicans and the blacks is mother fucker 
 Crooked police, gangs in chuck tailors 
 Bums sleeping in fuckin' trucks and trailers 
 Three hundred dollors every two weeks 
 From the stupid, tired, penny pinching pencil neck geeks 
 Abraham Lincoln told me I was free 
 So ima walk to corner and do what I want to 
 While you at work I'll be watchin cable, 
 Wit ya girl dancin' naked on my new pool table 
 I don't want to work no more 
 Modern day slavery knockin' on my front door 
 Can't see my kids can't see my wife, 
 Can't see a way to control my own life 
 Said I don't want to work no more 
 Modern day slavery knockin' on my front door 
 Can't see my kids can't see... 
 Ah man I got to sell like a twenty doller rock, y'all keep singing, I'll be right back. 
 (Melody) 
 I quit my job this morning' 
 I don't want to work no more 
 Fuck MacDonald's and Taco Bell, modern day slave rails 
 Is knocking on my front door 
 Get you a big fat sack of yayo 
 Can't see my kids can't see my wife 
 Can't see a way to control my dog-on life
