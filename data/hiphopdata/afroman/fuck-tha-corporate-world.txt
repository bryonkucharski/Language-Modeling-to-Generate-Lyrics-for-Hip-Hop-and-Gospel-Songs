I'ma quit my job, go home check on my girl 
 Fuck tha corporate world 
 Smoke marihuana, drink malt liquor till I earl 
 Fuck tha corporate world 
 Hop in the cadillac, let the daytoners twirl 
 Fuck tha corporate word 
 If tha cops [..] 
 Fuck tha corporate world 
 Paddy-wag, paddy wagon afroman 
 Ruff 'em up cuff 'em up, lock 'em in the can, 
 Mess up his records so he can't get a job, 
 Maybe he'll have to kill, steal and rob 
 Can he survive, yes he can, he the hungry hustler afroman 
 Ain't got no job, ain't got no credit 
 But whatever ya need, baby he'll go get it 
 Cut my hair is what y'all said 
 But I couldn't get a job with a bald head 
 First I get fired, last to get hired 
 I work for myself, Now I'm retired 
 Damn, take bravery 
 To escape modern day slavery. 
 Jam, you ever seen the place 
 Kinda look like [..] 
 I'ma quit my job, go home check on my girl 
 Fuck tha corporate world

 2003, [...] 
 Gold daytoners on a rolls-royce bentley, 
 Run the pencilnecks out the pool, 
 Sag my khakis, show my ass, 
 To the pencilneck-geeks sittin' in first class 
 Blonde bimbo, stretch limo 
 House next-do, to rush limbaugh 
 Standin on the curb, smokin' herb 
 Subwoofer subbin' all through the suburb 
 Underground baby, fuck the masses 
 Internet cellphone [..], 
 Sexy freak, everyday of the week 
 No [..] from a pencilneck-geek 
 Stop kissing ass, work for yourself 
 Fuck slavery! increase your wealth 
 Quit yo job, go home check on your girl 
 Fuck tha corporate world 
 Smoke marihuana, drink malt liquor till you earl 
 Fuck tha corporate world 
 Hop in the cadillac, let the daytoners twirl 
 Fuck tha corporate word 
 If tha cops [..] 
 Fuck tha corporate world
