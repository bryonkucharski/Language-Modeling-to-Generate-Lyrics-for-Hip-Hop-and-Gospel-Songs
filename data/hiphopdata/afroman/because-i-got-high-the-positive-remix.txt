Ironically... I care about everything 
 Check it out, playboys 
 I had problems with glaucoma, but then I got high 
 Smelled the cannabis aroma, and I got high 
 Glaucoma getting better and I know why 
 Because I got high, because I got high, because I got high 
 I used to smoke cigarettes, but then I got high 
 Getting tired and call it quits, but them I got high 
 I'm playing basketball and jogging and I know why 
 Because I got high, because I got high, because I got high 
 I used to drink beer and wine, but then I got high 
 I woke up feeling fine, because I got high 
 My hangover's over and I know why 
 Because I got high, because I got high, because I got high 
 Anxiety attacks, but then I got high 
 I used to take Xanax, but then I got high 
 No more prescription pills and I know why 
 Because I got high, because I got high, because I got high 
 The state made revenue, because I got high 
 They built a school or two, because I got high 
 Now the state can fund drug treatment and I know why 
 Because I got high, because I got high, because I got high 
 No more criminal traps if it's legalized 
 I don't have to buy from gang bangers shooting craps, if it's legalized 
 I can advocate with Weedmaps and I know why 
 It's legalized, it's legalized, it's legalized
