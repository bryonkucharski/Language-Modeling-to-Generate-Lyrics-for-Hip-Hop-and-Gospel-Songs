Yeah, there's a price to pay for the girls you lay 
 Life's gonna hand you a bill one day 
 Before your freedom or your life get took 
 Get a wife or a playboy book 
 One more time 
 There's a price to pay for the girls you lay 
 Life's gonna hand you a bill one day 
 Before your freedom or your life get took 
 Get a girl, a wife, or a playboy book 
 Sittin' at a red light 
 Tryin' to get my head right 
 This girl pass with a monster-ass 
 Mentally distracted 
 I mannishly reacted 
 My penis expanded 
 Her number I demanded 
 The questions I asked her were nice and discrete 
 But now she's in my passenger seat 
 Turn on the beat 
 Went to my castle 
 Fucked without a hassle 
 Oh it felt great, in her asshole 
 She was sexy, seductive, her name was Morgan 
 I loved the way she sucked my reproductive organ 
 I road it and road it 
 Finally unloaded (uh) 
 Went to the bathroom because I couldn't hold it 
 Oh I looked down and I was trippin' 
 Because I seen blood drippin' 
 Off the tip of my penis 
 It don't take a genius to figure she's a virgin 
 Scrubbed my dick with detergent 
 I'm in the mix, if you know what I mean 
 'Cause the girl's only sixteen 
 Your nipples are hard 
 Your booty is soft 
 But cutie, I need to drop you off, pass my keys 
 Smashin' down the street 
 Tryin' to get rid of the broad 
 But her mama standing in the front yard 
 Lookin' at me weird 'cause I'm gangsta geared 
 I look kinda old with a fro and a beard 
 She looked at me as if I was Satan 
 I smashed off on my hundred spoke daytons 
 Turned the shit up had the bass go whoppin' 
 Stressin' like a mothafucker goin' back to Compton 
 Turned down the street and I was skatin' homie 
 Sheriff department straight waitin' on me 
 We just need to ask a few questions homie 
 Why the fuck you putting these handcuffs on me? 
 Got to the station, now they tellin' me 
 That shit I did was a felony 
 Maybe you can release your rap tape 
 When you through doing time for statutory rape 
 Bucccccca 
 Padapapadaa... 
 Met this girl named Kim working at M&M 
 She was nice and slim 
 She got a man but she don't talk to him 
 You know, let her tell it 
 Sniff that pussy you can probably smell it 
 Anyway she got a baby, of course, of course 
 Her and her man is goin' through a divorce 
 We kept talkin' so good so far 
 We started walkin' back to my car 
 Fired up the engine went to my house 
 Pulled down my pants, started cheatin' on my spouse 
 With a slow tempo I fucked the broad 
 But she's a nympho, bitch like it fast and hard 
 Oh my god this girl is odd 
 Lost my vision as I shot my wad 
 Put on my pants, cocked up my gat 
 I gotta get rid of this hood rat 
 'Cause she's callin' other men on my telephone 
 It's time for this bitch to take her ass home 
 After ejaculation, took the bitch home with no conversation 
 No more Luther or S. Gate 
 I pulled out my all-white too short tape 
 I'm playin' dopamine beat, and the shit still hit 
 I'ma make the bitch walk if she talk some shit 
 Got to her house, banked on the curb 
 Threw my head back, fired up some herb 
 She asked me do you wanna come in? 
 I said wait a minute woman 
 Who do you live with? 
 She said I'm single I don't play that shit 
 I don't lie, I tell every guy 
 You gotta call me first before you come by 
 I said alright 
 Put my car in park 
 Then I walked inside 
 I hit the alarm on my '83 caddy 
 She was yippin' and yappin' 
 About her baby daddy 
 Talkin' with a hoochie pitch 
 She called her baby daddy a lil ol' bitch 
 Talkin' shit loud and fast 
 Bitch talkin' bout she kicked his ass 
 Said she socked him, like a lil ol' hoe 
 But we was disturbed by a knock on the door 
 Damn, who is that? where's my gat? 
 I hope I don't die fuckin' with this hood rat 
 I'm tryin' to be one of those Palmdale playas 
 But now I'm caught in some chaos 
 But now I'm caught in some chaos 
 But now I'm caught- 
 Hey anyway man 
 The TV and the radio was playin' 
 I couldn't quite figure out what they was sayin' 
 They voices started escalatin' 
 And I'm sittin' on the couch debatin' 
 Should I stay? should I leave? 
 Should I grab the bitch by her fuckin' weave? 
 Sock her in the eye, bitch don't lie 
 You knew your baby daddy was fixin' to come by 
 And you invited me in 
 Now look at the shape I'm in 
 My palms are sweaty 
 My muscles was tense 
 I stood up fool I couldn't take the suspense 
 I walked to the door kinda nervous 
 I'm not ready for a funeral service 
 Opened up the door, calm and cool 
 I got eye contact with the fool 
 She talked about him as if he was small 
 Come to find out he like seven feet tall 
 I spoke, he spoke 
 He gave me a pound with his hand 
 I walked right past the man 
 Jumped in my '83 Cadillac 
 Drove down the street then I never came back 
 Went to the house, grabbed the mic and started rappin' 
 About the scandalous shit that coulda happen
