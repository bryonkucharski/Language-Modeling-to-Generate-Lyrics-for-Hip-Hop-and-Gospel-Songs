Will somebody call me a cab? 
 I swallowed another tab 
 I might overdose under the circumstance 
 So betta yet call me an ambulance 
 'Cause I'ma dopefiend baby, I don't know why 
 All I wanna do is get high 
 Between your legs is where my brain is at 
 'Cause I'ma nymphomaniac 
 I used to smoke marijuana when I was a kid 
 Now I'm trippin' on acid 
 I'm high on every drug known to mankind 
 So go ahead and pass it 
 My designated driver was this girl 
 Her name was Carolyn 
 But I can't go home 'cause she just died from an overdose of heroin 
 She's a dopefiend baby 
 She don't know why 
 All she wants to do is get high 
 Between her legs is where my brain is at 
 'Cause I'ma nymphomaniac 
 This butt naked girl sat next to me 
 And offered me some ecstasy 
 Then she gave me a big fat kiss with a mouth full of LSD 
 Wave your hands in the air 
 Then wave it like you just don't care 
 If you got on clean underwear somebody say oh yeah 
 Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah 
 Check it out all the homeboys gather round 'cause 
 Repeat after me 
 Shit, God damn, get off your ass and jam 
 Shit, God damn, get off your ass and jam 
 Shit, God damn, get off your ass and jam 
 Shit, God damn, get off your ass and jam 
 My hands are shakin, my nose is twitchin, my eyeballs are real gigantic 
 I'm layin in bed, with a throbbin head, and I'm trippin' on widespread panic 
 Hell yeah, A man, I'm gonna do some impersonations right 
 A, the first one is a mixture between the lead singer of the B-52's 
 And Robert Smith from the cure right 
 I'm gonna do Axl Rose from Guns 'n' Roses 'cause 
 Willie Nelson, Willie Nelson, we gonna sing some country 
 Maybe I didn't fuck you 
 But little darling don't cry 
 The fact is I masturbated 
 About an hour before you came by 
 You were always on my mind 
 You were always on my mind 
 On the road again 
 Open up your legs and let me stick it in 
 My favorite past time is making love to my girlfriend 
 I can't wait to shoot my load again 
 Shoot my load again 
 Stick my dick some where it's never been
