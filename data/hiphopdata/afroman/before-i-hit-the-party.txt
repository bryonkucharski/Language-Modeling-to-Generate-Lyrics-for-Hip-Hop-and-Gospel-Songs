Before I hit the party (baby) 
 You know I need (what you need man, what you need man, what you need man) 
 Some coke 45 (baby), and a bag of weed (a bag of weed man, a bag of weed man, a bag of weed man) chorusx2 
 Friday night, time to party 
 Smoke marijuana, drink bacardi 
 Get drunk and I, before I leave 
 Put my hand on my wrist, push back my sleeve 
 Look at the time, I'm on my marijuana watch 
 Got a big thick girl rubbin on my crotch 
 My marijuana watch reads, 4ro:20 
 I'm getting fucked up while I make mo' money 
 The party don't start till 11:30 (porno time, watch so nerdy) 
 Thin girl with me got a big ol' butt 
 Whenever I want I can bust a, what 
 Jump off in the shower, 30 minutes to an hour 
 Stop out the shower on a thick white cloth 
 Big boodie bastray tryin' me out 
 Before I hit the party (baby) 
 You know I need (what you need man, what you need man, what you need man) 
 Some coke 45 (baby), and a bag of weed (a bag of weed man, a bag of weed man, a bag of weed man) chorusx2 
 I turned on the music to help me pick, something sick 
 To keep the girls on my dick 
 Looked in the closet what did I see, hemp suits lookin' back at me 
 Afroman be dressin pimpalicious, and women find me magicly delicious 
 Turn up the sterio, hit the blut, slick the fo' fo' 
 Weed, beer, plastic cup, afroman's pre-game warm up 
 Do it till the liqor and the weed kick in 
 My sight get blurry and my edge spin 
 Now I am offially fucked up 
 Pour the rest of the beer in my styrofoam cup 
 Before I hit the party (baby) 
 You know I need (what you need man, what you need man, what you need man) 
 Some coke 45 (baby), and a bag of weed (a bag of weed man, a bag of weed man, a bag of weed man) chorusx2
