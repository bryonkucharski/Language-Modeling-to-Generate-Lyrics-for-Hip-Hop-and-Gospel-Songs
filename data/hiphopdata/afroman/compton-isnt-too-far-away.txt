When I was young we wanted to get out the ghetto 
 But after we moved out of the ghetto 
 It was hard to get things we needed 
 I took a picture in the hood 
 Standing by the door 
 White T shirt and black khakis 
 Sagging kind of low 
 I see the corner that I worked 
 With my homies in the back 
 LAPD searching us 
 Looking for some crack 
 I don't need to be the king of the world 
 All I need is some activator 
 For my Jehri curl 
 Compton isn't too far away 
 Neither is South Central LA 
 No matter what the cops try and say 
 We move from South Central 
 To the desert of the real high 
 Palmdale-Lancaster 
 Blue suburban sky 
 When I come home late at night 
 The sheriff harasses me 
 He puts me in the choke hold 
 So bad I can barely breath 
 I'm the hungry hustler Afroman 
 I'm going parking lot platinum in my Astrovan 
 Compton isn't too far away 
 Neither is South Central LA 
 No matter what the cops try and say 
 I'm selling yay 
 I see police lights 
 On palmdale boulevard 
 Back-up units pulling in 
 I'm thinking oh my god 
 I got nowhere else to go 
 My hands are in the air 
 I don't know what to do 
 But you can't have my weed and my brew
