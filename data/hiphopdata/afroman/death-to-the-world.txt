Death to the world! Cthulhu's come: 
 Let Earth abhor this thing. 
 Let every mind prepare for doom, 
 As anguish and woe he'll bring. 
 As anguish and woe he'll bring. 
 As anguish and woe he'll bring. 
 Up from the sea, R'lyeh did rise: 
 The cultists awestruck dumb. 
 With ancient rites so wretched and perverse, 
 Cthulhu's time has come. 
 Cthulhu's time has come. 
 Cthulhu's time has come. 
 Death to the world! Cthulhu reigns. 
 The Great Old Ones Destroy 
 With wrath and doom, so cruel and foul, 
 Replete with obscene joy. 
 Replete with obscene joy. 
 Replete with obscene joy. 
 He rules the Earth with dreadful might, 
 And through our ghastly dreams 
 His twisting turning tentacles 
 Elicit from us maddened screams. 
 Cthulhu's time has come. 
 Cthulhu's time has come. 
 Cthulhu's time has come.
