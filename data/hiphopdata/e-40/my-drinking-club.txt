Step right up! 
 From the East to the West, from the North to the South 
 Sign up right'ere, your scheduled membership 
 To the drinkin' club 
 Uh... 
 They got you soaked (that's right) 
 I see your cup up (drink it to em) 
 Let's get drunk 
 And get my fortune out of my drinking club 
 (E-40) 
 E-40 in the C-L-I-C 
 Stuck up in the house, party top celebrity 
 Burpin and gurpin, gelchin the bourbon, lurkin around 
 I'm seein all kinda broads, from outta town 
 Uh, top hots, tycoons, big cheeses 
 Plus the perpetual jahahnjawel priestess 
 Homies and lurkers and things like that up under the vertical shade 
 Rovers in lamborghinis swimming pink bikinis, lingerie 
 Tryin' to knock her big ass by all bus lights on Fridays 
 If you're not a member of my drinking club, sideways 
 What kind of motherfuckin perculatoins you niggaz got 
 Up in the refrigerator? 
 Who wanna join my drinkin' club, sign up the legislature 
 Might not know how to read and write but I do know how to count money 
 You can call me Lieutenant Fuck a Hoe but all the ruskie runny 
 You can dip but don't screw up, speakers on sub 
 Beat your ass, my drinking club 
 *Chorus w/ variations* 2X 
 (Young Mugzi) 
 I got you perved on some of the righteous, who's the tightest 
 I'm down with pipes fifth and gallons of the finest nitrous 
 Oh girl now pass the joint to the nigga big head 
 Where I hear about your scheamin but the rotations I don't jinn 
 Who dog sin? Big fin is what I'm rollin' 
 You know how I do, I got bunny boo boo grippin and totin 
 Fools be pimpin', we guaranteed to have you spittin' 
 Bobcat tight, while I'm pullin secure out my linen 
 I'm nothin' but a baller, alkaholic bitches pop my collar 
 Tearin down pussy walls in your motherfuckin daughter 
 M-O-S, S-I-E 
 M-U-G, and K-I-V 
 Always to' with E-4-0 
 Hit the air like cubes by a liquor store 
 (E-40) 
 Motherfuckers better know, we gets down like that 
 Straighten up, beer mugs, my drinkin' cup bitch! 
 *Chorus w/ variations* 2X 
 So damn deep, I can't call it 
 I guess I'm just an alkaholic 
 Huh, dagnabbit, doggonit 
 Ya Hillside hillbilly vomit 
 Back and forth to the bathroom constantly 
 All the actors gather up, and watch me 
 Get super twisted highly afflicted every day a cherry 
 Go on my body and throw up on the bartender 
 Pull out a wad of money, ballers up to par 
 Treat the whole party, by buyin up the bar 
 Sharp pain and orange juice got my moose up 
 Stainless artichokes, tequila poppes, Medusas 
 Better prepare myself for the upset stomach, oh 
 Stop by the M.P. on the way home and pick up a bottle of Pepto-Bismol 
 Step right up now last call for alcohol 
 Get your hurricane gorilla member here ya monsters 
 That's right, 'cause when we and my motherfuckin entourage 
 Get together and we come back from a motherfuckin concert 
 And the afterpaty jumpin' off, I wanna see ID's, we got video cameras 
 We checkin' all you bastards under 21 or under 18 or whatever however

 Once you drink with us, you won't be the same 
 The drinkin' club, we can't slow down main 
 We're gonna drink you all, we got a monster pit 
 That's right

 And tuck, throw up, and drink again 
 Repeat A, first line of B, then chorus 5X (E-40 talking throughout)
