Man, I can sell anything, mane 
 I got the mouth piece of a pimp, man 
 Who want it, who want it? 
 I can sell it, I can sell it 
 Who need it, who need it? 
 I can sell it, I can sell it 
 I got a gold mouthpiece 
 I can sell it, I can sell it 
 Holla at me in the streets 
 I can sell it 
 I can sell a flat tire to a bike 
 A left to a right, a root beet to a sprite 
 A dick to a dyke, a mute to a mike 
 Wind to a kite, dark to bright, a shadow to a light 
 Cheese to pizza, slut to a diva 
 Stripes to a zebra, spots to a cheetah 
 Tall can to a liter, sell sound to a speaker 
 A bucket to a Beemer, a scam to a schemer 
 Sell love to hate, the truth to lies 
 Sell real to fake, sell shit to flies 
 Sell gas to Texaco, insurance to Geico 
 Tank full of petro, minutes to metro 
 Hill billy like Jethro, magazines [Incomprehensible] 
 Screaming that eastside, straight up out the valley yo 
 It's Sick Wid It, in case you suckas didn't know 
 I can sell snow to a ski slope 
 Who want it, who want it? 
 I can sell it, I can sell it 
 Who need it, who need it? 
 I can sell it, I can sell it 
 I got a gold mouthpiece 
 I can sell it, I can sell it 
 Holla at me in the streets 
 I can sell it 
 Who want it, who want it? 
 I can sell it, I can sell it 
 Who need it, who need it? 
 I can sell it, I can sell it 
 I got a gold mouthpiece 
 I can sell it, I can sell it 
 Holla at me in the streets 
 I can sell it 
 I can sell mud to a worm, sell a pimp a perm 
 Knock a bitch on a straight path, sell her a term 
 Sell fire to a match, ice to a freezer 
 Sell itch to a scratch, sell credit to a VISA 
 Sell the club for street weed, zip for zip 
 And fly to Iraq and sell extra clips 
 Sell sand to the beach, fuzz to a peach 
 Get double for each, sell lips to a leach 
 I can sell Buffy some ass, sell a bum some trash 
 Sell trees in a forest, sell the yard some grass 
 Sell the future to the past, a blind man some glasses 
 Miles to a car, cigar some ashes 
 Sell wool to a sheep, dead man some sleep 
 I can sell some best friends some beef, shit 
 I can sell a shark some teeth 
 I got a nigga's nigga, y'all can get it from me 
 Who want it, who want it? 
 I can sell it, I can sell it 
 Who need it, who need it? 
 I can sell it, I can sell it 
 I got a gold mouthpiece 
 I can sell it, I can sell it 
 Holla at me in the streets 
 I can sell it 
 Who want it, who want it? 
 I can sell it, I can sell it 
 Who need it, who need it? 
 I can sell it, I can sell it 
 I got a gold mouthpiece 
 I can sell it, I can sell it 
 Holla at me in the streets 
 I can sell it 
 I can sell grapes to a vineyard, chicken to the colonel 
 Keys to a custodian, speed to turbo 
 Kicks to Beckham, skills to a veteran 
 Pills to Excedrin, joy to depression 
 Sell a bar some drinks, a coat to a mink 
 Sell some thoughts to a thinker, psychologists to a shrink 
 I can sell weight to a gym, 11 times outta 10 
 Sell rain to a storm, sell blow to a hard 
 Look I can sell sugar to a cake, water to a lake 
 Shoes to a snake, shake to a quake 
 Wings to a boat, sleeves to a coat 
 A page to a book, some crimes to a crook 
 I can sell thin to frail, a shell to a snail 
 White to pale, off to a scale 
 Grind to a block, time to a clock 
 Silent to a rock, detox to a knock 
 Who want it, who want it? 
 I can sell it, I can sell it 
 Who need it, who need it? 
 I can sell it, I can sell it 
 I got a gold mouthpiece 
 I can sell it, I can sell it 
 Holla at me in the streets 
 I can sell it 
 Who want it, who want it? 
 I can sell it, I can sell it 
 Who need it, who need it? 
 I can sell it, I can sell it 
 I got a gold mouthpiece 
 I can sell it, I can sell it 
 Holla at me in the streets 
 I can sell it
