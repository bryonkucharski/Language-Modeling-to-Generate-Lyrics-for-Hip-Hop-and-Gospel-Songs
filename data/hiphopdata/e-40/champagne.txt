Get up early, tell that bitch to give brain 
 Then brush my teeth with champagne 
 Then brush my teeth with champagne 
 Then brush my teeth with champagne 
 Get up early, tell that bitch to give brain 
 Then brush my teeth with champagne 
 Then brush my teeth with champagne 
 Then brush my teeth with champagne 
 We met at the club, I fucked her the fire 
 She swam in the pool, I smoked in the spa 
 Girl and we ball, you robbin' Peter for Paul 
 Gotta keep indoors when killers sleep in your yard 
 I get it so fast on your sense you're the vet 
 I'm up in the function, young nigga tippin' this glass 
 My jacket expensive, it's made out of lizard 
 I fuck with E-40, that nigga been bout his business 
 We going million for million, OG giving me game 
 BS all in my deal then sprinkle me mane 
 Fuck boy, been real 
 Big money, straight 'bout it 
 Double M, E-40 
 Rose straight wilin' 
 Get up early, tell that bitch to give brain 
 Then brush my teeth with champagne 
 Then brush my teeth with champagne 
 Then brush my teeth with champagne 
 My gold chain bitch like a monument 
 Music hella wild like a argument 
 Throw yo head like a golf tournament 
 Hanging on the trees like a ornament 
 And I put that on my gat, 30R6 with the good far strap 
 Put yo face back like a plastic surgeon 
 Put you out of business like Merlin's 
 This is for kisses and flirtin' 
 He suffers baby lotion, Jergens 
 If you satisfyin' that botch 
 You ain't gotta pacify that botch 
 Take the training wheels off (Take the training wheels off) 
 Look, I'm never on time, I'm the last to arrive 
 Probably gon' be late for my own funeral 
 Never been a square, never been a cubical 
 Used to sell drugs like a pharmaceutical 
 Pharmaceutical, pharmaceutical 
 Used to sell drugs like a pharmaceutical 
 Got the blue whip, got the green thumb 
 Split it down the middle, put it in my lung 
 Get up early, tell that bitch to give brain 
 Then brush my teeth with champagne 
 Then brush my teeth with champagne 
 Then brush my teeth with champagne 
 On point, I'm filthy 
 That's that free throw 
 They said I burned my bridges 
 Cop a speedboat 
 Young nigga ballin', fuck niggas don't like it 
 Got yo bitch in the air, legs crossed like mercy 
 Man I brush my teeth with champagne 
 Fucked yo bitch wearin every chain 
 Big firetruck full of them 
 Get that D like Gary Payton 
 California here, coke boys out here 
 Can't you see I'm high? 
 Stop talkin' there inmy ear 
 Swerving Xan too, diamonds be clean 
 I'm the 10th mill, have me hot for 10 weeks 
 Sippin on it, grippin' on it, whippin' on that foreign 
 Now I'm beefin' on er all night 
 And I'll be a ghost in the morning 
 Get up early, tell that bitch to give brain 
 Then brush my teeth with champagne 
 Then brush my teeth with champagne 
 Then brush my teeth with champagne
