(D-Shot) 
 Hey now baby, how you been doin'? 
 You been doin' fine? 
 You know you called me last week 
 I got your message but I was outta state, yaknowhatI'msayin? 
 (Now I come through, just like the hog I am) 
 It seems you need a little bit of excitement in your life 
 (All up in her bedroom, serenading one of my tunes) 
 I'm here for you, don't sweat it 
 (She's got an attitude against her man) 
 How your man be treatin you? 
 (She needs me to get her in the mood) 
 I know 
 (I had to hit her, I'm never scary I'll be yo huckleberry!) 
 See you can call me any hour, that's how we do it 
 I'm in and out, and partner you ain't knowin' this 
 She loves you dearly but she's all on a player's tip 
 Cause you ain't givin' somethin' that she really needs 
 And that's that good ass lovin', partner can't you see 
 She's bored no trust, she sits in the house all day 
 While you out there ballin, tryin' to have it the kingpin way 
 She gets no time, your schedule way too deep 
 You leaves out the house every time you get a beep 
 To all you ladies, sweet dark and lovely 
 See players like me, I likes to taste the Easter bunny 
 I likes to lick you down, give you self esteem 
 I'm the playboy you want, on your under team 
 Yo' huckleberry, mackin fast Shot-ty 
 One of them type of ballers on the same level as Gotti 
 So all you tenders, it's all to the good 
 So page me on the under and I'll creep through yo' hood 
 If you need some lovin', lovin' girl 
 I'll be yo' huckleberry, berry 
 And if you need someone to talk to girl, talk to girl 
 You can call me on the under, under 
 (E-40) 
 Lookin' at my oyster perpetual Rolex, browsin through my Rolodex 
 Baby done left a verbal, want me to hit that girdle 
 Come through on a tuck, while he's in the shower 
 Get it when he's with Rob and 'em, after hours 
 Slumpin Johnnie Taylor, regulatin 
 Cheatin' in next room, fornicatin' 
 Demonstratin, new and improved moves 
 Legislatin, Erk and drinkin' booze 
 But when you plug it, baby see you soon 
 You say one day, we gon' jump the broom 
 It was seven years, and she was faithful for ya 
 But did she love ya, or was she used to ya 
 It ain't my fault you got too attached 
 But don't check me partner, check yo baitch 
 Wanna know my name, call me 40 Pop Cherry 
 I'll be yo huckleberry 
 (D-Shot) 
 I'm on yo mind, twenty-four seven 
 When you at work, you calls me at eleven 
 And that's cool, cause my number won't be on yo' bill 
 Oh baby girl all we wanna do is keep it real 
 No hesitation, we wanna play this game right 
 But if you feel me, we gots to have our game tight 
 So we can mob to the beach and champagne and all 
 Rub you down to the camisole 
 One hundred miles away, while your man think you at work 
 That boy Shot, is all up in these skirts 
 If there's a bluebird on my shoulder should I hit it 
 I turn her around, then from the back that's when I hit it 
 But hittin it from the back ain't always what I wanna do 
 I got ta do you hard, so you can tell your crew 
 That that boy Shot knows how to... *uck 
 He got you givin' it up 
 And you ain't done that in years 
 That's right 
 And you ain't done that in years 
 Keep it on the under, on the under, no one has to know 
 It's between me and you, take my pager number 
 You can call me, call me, all times of the day...
