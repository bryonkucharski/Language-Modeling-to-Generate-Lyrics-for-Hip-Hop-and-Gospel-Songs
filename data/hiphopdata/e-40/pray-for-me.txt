I've seen a lot pain since I was a child so 
 (Pray for me) 
 I've done a few things that just ain't right so 
 (Pray for me) 
 What I've been through would make you cry so 
 (Pray for me, pray for me) 
 I'm trying to change my life so 
 (Pray for me) 
 Ain't no dope on the streets, mayne, I'm behind in my rent 
 I ain't got nothing to show for all the fedi that I done spent 
 I told my mom to cash out my life insurance policy, the money 
 She been planning on using to bury me 
 My ribs touching, my paper struggling, mayne 
 All my life I been hustling, running in place 
 But can't seem to finish the race 
 Seen dudes get whopped in the face 
 Get plucked like a bass, flew in the space for senselessness 
 That's why I stayed prayed up and say my grace 
 Even when I'm blended 
 Never know when your life is suspended 
 God can take his arms from around you and easily end it 
 At any time, any place, any where 
 I know my life has been spared on several occasions 
 Suckas hating, I'm still here 
 How come loved ones fall out and never talk again to each other 
 Why does it take a funeral to bring a family together? 
 Bad weather always looks worse through a window 
 Stressing and rubbing my temples 
 I make it look easy but it's really not all that simple 
 I've seen a lot pain since I was a child so 
 (Pray for me) 
 I've done a few things that just ain't right so 
 (Pray for me) 
 What I've been through would make you cry so 
 (Pray for me, pray for me) 
 I'm trying to change my life so 
 (Pray for me) 
 Young dude full of soul food, mama cooking pork chops 
 Uncle slapping dominos, sister playing hop scotch 
 And this was before the block got hot and infected 
 And everybody knew my grand daddy well respected, check it 
 Time went on and the game kicked in 
 I was losing comrades either death or the penn 
 I was losing comrades but I'm stacking them ends 
 We ever go to 600, we losing our friends 
 When grand mama passed that's when it all went bad 
 Aunties don't talk, my cousins fighting its bad 
 In the snow Thanksgiving is like the ones we had and it's sad 
 So I express through a pen and a pad 
 I'm on my third wind pimpin' and knowing Jesus is with me 
 Ain't no weapon form against me, back in common defeating 
 I've been posted in the cut when them angels come get me 
 Until that day, homie, just pray for me 
 I've seen a lot pain since I was a child so 
 (Pray for me) 
 I've done a few things that just ain't right so 
 (Pray for me) 
 What I've been through would make you cry so 
 (Pray for me, pray for me) 
 I'm trying to change my life so 
 (Pray for me) 
 My kinfolk, babymomma on welfare, they house is bigger than ours 
 'Cause they got section 8 vouchers, W.I.C. and benefit cards 
 My home girl daughter diabetic, she like to eat a whole lot 
 She only 9 and a half and taking insulin shots 
 My dude got a heart condition, his ankles be swollen 
 'Cause he got high blood pressure and he refuse to quit smoking 
 But I'm no better than y'all, I like to drink alcohol 
 Break out the pen and start writing about the things that I saw 
 Like kilo grams of that raw and uncut Peruvian flake 
 Wrapped in aluminum foil and duck tape 
 Bust open and throwed in the pot, foamy and mushy 
 Melted and locked in a shape of a gigantic size white cookie 
 Put on the towel to dry and broken down into zips 
 Quarters and half of 16's and yola get flipped 
 I maintain my faith in G O D 'cause it's just a test 
 Repent, we confess, extra gratefulness, yes, I'm blessed 
 I've seen a lot pain since I was a child so 
 (Pray for me) 
 I've done a few things that just ain't right so 
 (Pray for me) 
 What I've been through would make you cry so 
 (Pray for me, pray for me) 
 I'm trying to change my life so 
 (Pray for me) 
 I'm here right now 
 (Pray for me) 
 I need y'all to take this, I need y'all to take this pain away 
 (Pray for me) 
 I'm trying, feels like I'm dying 
 (Pray for me) 
 I need y'all to pray for me, oh, Lord 
 (Pray for me) 
 Every time I look around 
 (Pray for me) 
 Somebody got somethin' to say 
 (Pray for me) 
 (Pray for me) 
 I need y'all to pray for me 
 (Pray for me) 
 I'm trying to do the right thing 
 (Pray for me) 
 Pray for me
