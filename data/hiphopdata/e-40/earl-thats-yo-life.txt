(Too $hort) 
 Earl... whassup mayne? 
 It's yo' potnah Short Dawg 
 You know we come a long way baby 
 +From the Ground Up+ 
 Oh they love the way us players ball 
 No doubt, that's how we do this 
 It's all about you mayne 
 It's yo' life, let 'em know somethin' 
 (E-40) 
 I come from where they pop they collars 
 And couldn't be saved by Creflo Dollar 
 'Cause I'll probably never ever see the pearly gates 
 At the rate I'm goin' now, it'll be too late 
 Take life taste it, get on and smell it 
 You know what Charlie is? Well it's sucker repellant 
 I spray myself with it every morning, you dig? 
 I spray myself right before I leave the crib 
 Hot ones echo through the ghetto, bullets ricochet 
 I'm bendin corners in my Cadillac Escalade 
 It's summertime and I'm scorchin, fuck a bulletproof 
 I'm hella keyed and I'm perkin off that num-num juice 
 I'm in the traffic with my music on STORM 
 Got a ticket just for blowin' my, HORN (ba-baaa, ba-ba-ba-baa-baaaa) 
 The real, pinkie ring, princess cut 
 Carats on, around my neck 
 Lookin' like some clones, be at yo' best 
 We don't play checkers no more, we play chess 
 One trey tri trey double (??) 
 H-I-double-L sideshow 
 All about my fetti-oh 
 One-time want to see me fold 
 It's ob-vious I'm humungous 
 Acres cars and businesses 
 All about my fetti-oh 
 Bank account got to be tall 
 Diamonds on my wrists and shit 
 Tycoon stickin to the script, BEOTCH! 
 Chorus: {sung} 
 Earl, that's yo' life 
 Ooh Earl, that's yo' life 
 Earl, that's yo' life 
 Ooh Earl, that's yo' liii-iiii-iiii-iiii-iife 
 (E-40) 
 Straight up out the game 
 The realest nigga you done talked to all day 
 It's the dry season, outsmart the po'-po's 
 Cookin birdies in the kitchen, with C-Bo 
 From livin' nappy, e'rybody know me 
 Used to sell taffy, white girl nasal candy 
 Hoes'll dress tacky, just so I can bank they dome 
 Bank 'em make them think I'm broke, 
 Use the dope game as a steppin stone 
 (??) (??) Next steal walkie talkies 
 I'm the one that really-natin them faulty chips 
 I got the gift of gab, I'm off the choo choo track 
 I want the fetti, fuck the fame, y'all can HAVE THAT 
 One-time want to see me fold 
 It's ob-vious I'm humungous 
 [$Hort] That's right 
 Acres cars and businesses 
 [$Hort] You can't stop the tycoon 
 All about my fetti-oh 
 Bank account got to be tall 
 Diamonds on my wrists and shit 
 [$Hort] You can't stop E-Feezy, BEYATCH 
 (E-40) 
 The street life, +Ballin Outta Control+ 
 My +Million Dollar Spot+, way too cold 
 So many +Record Haters+, my +Back Against the Wall+ 
 When I was growin' up I seen a lot of +Rappers Ball+ 
 Bring the yellow tape, +It's On, On Sight+ 
 You wanna squash the funk? Shoot me a peace kite 
 Where the party at? Who got that Carlos Rossi? 
 Who in my +Drinkin' Club+? I'm bout to mob somebody 
 I'm fee-ed-exin, (??) have me do a (??) wait 
 From sardines and SPAM to Terriaki steaks 
 I looked the game in the eye, the game looked at me back 
 Told me to sell my triple beam, and start rap 
 One-time want to see me fold 
 It's ob-vious I'm humungous 
 Acres cars and businesses 
 All about my fetti-oh 
 Bank account got to be tall 
 Diamonds on my wrists and shit 
 Tycoon stickin to the script, BEOTCH!
