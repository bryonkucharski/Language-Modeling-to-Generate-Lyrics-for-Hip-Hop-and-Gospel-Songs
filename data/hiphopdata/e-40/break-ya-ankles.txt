 Hey, let's go 
 From the West Coast to Atlanta 
 If a nigga gonna hate, well, got damn 'em 
 Hey, gonna break ya ankles

 Go stupid, get retarded 
 (Dumb, dumb) 
 Wake the game up, them boys made it 
 (Dumb, dumb) 
 Hey, gonna break ya ankles 
 We be the shit out of me 
 Gonna break ya ankles 
 This a boy, this thang slap 
 I brought the whole hood with me, brought the whole trap 
 Mama, this your song, you know the lyrics 
 Gonna break ya ankles, yeah, that's the spirit 
 Go nutty, go bananas, go berserk 
 Show them how to do it, let me see your foot work 
 We runnin' up a tab, havin' money so we spend it 
 Bottles everywhere, celebrating like we won the pennant 
 You recognize the fixture, you see the brightling watch 
 You get the big picture, you know that I'm a boss 
 I'mma show up, I'mma show out 
 From the West Coast to the dirty south 
 Hey, let's go

 If a nigga gonna hate, well, got damn 'em 
 Hey, gonna break ya ankles

 Wake the game up, them boys made it 
 (Dumb, dumb) 
 Hey, gonna break ya ankles

 Gonna break ya ankles 
 Fresh off tour, I brought a mil with me 
 Now the whole club gonna have to deal with me 
 Like 3-6, tear the club up 
 Like Pac-Man 'cause I don't give a fuck 
 I'm throwing big bucks, cash everywhere 
 Shawty over here, 40 over there 
 You know the broads out 'cause the stars out 
 You see the parking lot, we brought the cars out 
 We going stupid, get retarded 
 And we ain't playin' with 'em, we came to party 
 I brought a lot of doe, I'm steadin' throwin' singles 
 So hit the dance floor, so gonna break ya ankles 
 From the West Coast to Atlanta 
 If a nigga gonna hate, well, got damn 'em 
 Hey, gonna break ya ankles 
 Hit the dance floor 
 Gonna break ya ankles 
 Go stupid, get retarded 
 (Dumb, dumb) 
 Wake the game up, them boys made it 
 (Dumb, dumb) 
 Hey, gonna break ya ankles 
 We be the shit out of me 
 Gonna break ya ankles 
 Do it like this, do it like that 
 Do it like this, then you do it like that 
 Break it on down, show 'em how to clown 
 Mean mug with it, let me see you rep your town 
 All street money, bonafide trapper 
 Never seen a check, ballin' like a rapper 
 80 on the arm, a hundred on my neck 
 Shoe game sick, in The Bay we call it wet 
 More jury than the court room, glowin' like the moon 
 More jury than the court room, I'mma tycoon 
 Designer everything, throw it in the bag 
 I don't know how much it costs, I don't look at price tags 
 From the West Coast to Atlanta 
 If a nigga gonna hate, well, got damn 'em 
 Hey, gonna break ya ankles 
 Hit the dance floor 
 Gonna break ya ankles 
 Go stupid, get retarded 
 (Dumb, dumb) 
 Wake the game up, them boys made it 
 (Dumb, dumb) 
 Hey, gonna break ya ankles 
 We be the shit out of me 
 Gonna break ya ankles
