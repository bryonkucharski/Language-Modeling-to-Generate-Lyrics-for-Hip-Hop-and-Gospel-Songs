Huh? Want me to speak the real? 
 Speak the real man 
 Nigga, speak the real 
 Speak the real 
 Speak the real 
 Speak the real 
 Speak the real 
 It's a quarter after nine on my AM, FM 
 Radio Shack, digital motel, six o' clock alarm reads 
 "40, get your ass up, time to hit the grind 
 You can't afford to pass no money, I know you heard about that" 
 What, what? "Task raided Millersville, Ms. Miller had a heart attack" 
 Dude, that's some cold shit, ain't it huh? 
 I know, she was a good person for certain I know 
 V-Town, California, where I was born, raised and grown 
 And since 1979, I been a hustler on the go 
 You know the drill, my mission for real, a mealticket 
 You feel, we slowly but surely approachin' seven digits 
 Figurines, sticky doo hicky and Angel Dust 
 Mescaline, niggas know better than fuck with us 
 I'm pimped out flossin' in Reno in the casino 
 Big bid, fuckin' off feddie, I could've put down on a crib 
 I does that, I do, rejuvenate, redeem 
 Take a lose, take a lose don't make a scene 
 Nigga charge it to the triple beam, fuck the stress 
 I let that orange box of baking soda do the rest 
 Holler at my neighborhood chef, Raul 
 Known for cloning chickens and turning one into two 
 That's what he do for a living, that's all he's used to 
 Playtex rubber dish washing gloves and residue, biotch 
 Bullshit ain't nothin' 
 You see we gone keep this thuggin' 
 And mean muggin', jump until it's a done deal 
 You see E-40 and Sick Wid, it bring the real, nothin' but 
 What if I bring this back down? 
 Which one, which one cap'n? 
 You got to be about it or be without it 
 Be about it or without it, ay, you know what? 
 I smell you on that playboy, look 
 We fin to run down a whole tac on these bitch ass, niggaz 
 Niggas ain't smellin' this shit, we do this shit 
 Last night I slapped a bitch upside her dome with my faulty phone 
 That Heifer's tired she tried to slash my tire 
 Caught me in the bed with her cousin Tanji 
 From the track she use to hold my sack 
 I use to dick her down 
 Way back in eighty-six she use to look just like a sketch 
 But now that bitch got a ass, tits, body and boy, that bitch is bad 
 For what it's worth, the pussy smelled like Certs 
 Victoria's Secret 
 Now folks, just remember, I never said I thought about lickin' pussy 
 I said I never thought about eatin' it 
 Keepin' it and treatin' it nice 
 Fuck that, I'm a hog 
 I put it down, I'm from the hood 
 Where I live on the outskirts of town on the tuck in the cut 
 In some empty apartments, man 
 I'm a baller so you know I ain't got shit in my name 
 I'm strictly ghetto celebrity, niggaz get buried 
 Ready for combat if you plottin' and plannin' 
 Oh if you come for me and confiscate my dough 
 Let the buzzer be the bail 
 But my suggestion is to stay within your envelope 
 I'm block to block, swingin' on vines 
 Community service, put up stop signs 
 Uh, hold the fuck on 
 Did you or did you not tell these niggaz to stay within they envelope? 
 Shit, these toddlers is green to the game 
 They ain't know nothin' about these tramps 
 Six bedroom flats and gettin' dealt 
 And held a hand across the mat 
 You see we from the Yay, where we control they minds 
 And put these hoes on the grind 
 Ain't got to but I still touch it 
 Went to 7-Eleven, picked up a traders book 
 And bought a bucket 
 Use to have a perm taller than the Charlotte Hornets 
 But I had to cut that bitch off 'cause see your partna had warrant 
 That I ain't even handled yet, although I'm havin' cake 
 The little homie from the hood, want me to put out his tape 
 He kinda tight too, remind me of The Click crew 
 'Cause they was spittin' that old high powered 
 Godzilla ballin' guru, ass type shit you can relate to 
 Wake to, 'scape to when it's sunny 
 Ride by, slide by, get at a honey 
 I know these streets like I know my dick 
 I can tell you who the nigga is that's about to get jacked 
 And the nigga that pulled the lick 
 I got this bitch on lock 
 999,999 plus a dollar in a safe deposit box 
 Marijuana crops still in this roster 
 Kilogram, coca leaf and morphine 
 What about my niggas in the 415? 
 Look what they made 
 My niggaz in the city 
 They call it made 
 Top grade regeneration, uncut 
 Designer weed, straight hempilation, what the fuck? 
 Sheit, sheit, sheit sheit, sheit sheit, sheit 
 999,999 plus a dollar, plus a dollar man 
 Plus a dollar, plus a dollar, man, equals a mealticket bitch 
 Biotch, sheit, sheit, fuck it
