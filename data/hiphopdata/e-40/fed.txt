 Broke up out of that old punk shit and said, 
 "Momma I'ma do what the fuck I wanna!" 
 Hit the streets and make a wheelbarrow full of bread if I end up dead 
 Then press delete- I'm tired of eating powdered meat 
 Within a nigga timah to get to the grind, so that boy scored a quarter key 
 Two hundred and fifty-two electronic milligrams 
 We'll sell it like a coke candy organization 
 And I'm plugged with it, bail off into that old high-powered shit 
 These are the type of niggas that'll let a nigga know 
 When the drought about to hit, my ?peach and jelly? 
 Get a 40 and mask it, post it on God 
 Because me got me scratch paper buried in the backyard 
 Me and my Click roll thick for real and be thinkin' of funk like you a moth 
 Problems nigga? Let that go or get your head tooken off 
 Catch you out of bounds on the wrong fuckin' s-oil 
 Wrap that ass up like aluminim f-oil 
 I'm Fed Ex, heavy duty nigga, pushin weight (pushin weight) 
 From sardines and Spam to Teriyaki steak, motherfucker ain't but 
 Plus sixteen, fuckin' around with the skillet, makin' a killin' 
 Runnin' through three or four units a week on the over over 
 Puttin' the Whammy on 'em (Whammy on 'em) 
 Cake up and baking soda, all that old shit

 You probably got lieutenants and killers all on the squadron 
 With po-po's on payroll, huh 
 Lavish vehicles, they only make life fo'-up 
 Front row seats at the fights, takin' long expensive flights, huh 
 Q's, P's, birth certificates and fake ID's 
 Like to drink liquor, with beadies and leaves 
 The motherfuckin' fuzz wanna stop us 
 Found our fingerprints on some choppers 
 Listenin' to the scanner, I hear the Penelope's say 
 "Man uh, them nigger boys, I can't stand uh" 
 Young hoodlums sellin' hawk, cloggin up the block 
 Inna come-a new 6-double-zero drop 
 We party in matches VIP's nigga fuck a fly 
 Invite celebrities like E-40 and JR Ridah, timah 
 "I'm so serious!" 
 "I'm so serious brotha!" 
 "I'm so serious brotha!"

 You niggas got me fucked, fucked up 
 Me yanked myself up out the game, hold up, motherfucker 
 I got bills to pay, nigga if you don't get out my way 
 I'm gonna peels your toupee, I'm in it to stay and I'm strapped in the Bay 
 But I never woulda thought that I would feel like 
 That I can invest my money in a franchise 
 Get 'em up out the hood before my homies lose they lizzives 
 Buy a fuckin' record company and watch my mail rise 
 Ha ha, yeah, timah 
 Big Timah, a motherfucker have his br-ead, may-an 
 Fed Ex to the highest degree, tax free 
 Ballin' out of motherfuckin' control 
 A major factor playin' a white man's game man 
 Sneak in and sneak out 
 Campaign champagne and clam thang 
 Game can be sold and told at the same time 
 And this shit here is designed to sprinkle yo' mind 
 High-powered ass shit man for my high-powered ass Clickalation 
 Get it while it's good before it's to graduation
