 It's in the heart man 
 I can feel it right here man, it's real 
 (Every year about this time) 
 Every year about this time, yessuh 
 (There's someone like me) 
 There's always a dark cloud that lingers over the city 
 There it is 
 And I wanna preach about it, looka here 
 Every year about this time I get to diggin up 
 Old school memories that I keep stored in the back of the head 
 In the back of my mind that I always seem to find 
 When I'm marinatin with my peoples, slappin bones and drinkin' wine 
 Just come home from Quentin, and all I know is strind 
 Grind, time-uh, dope game been gone it's either 
 White collared crime or uh, clickin da bones 
 How can I make some sort of dividends 
 How can I get my mathematics on how can I get in where I fit in 
 How can I, get in get gone 
 Every year about this time it's always, someone like me 
 They uh, handcuff and shackle, and uh, throw away the key 
 Every year about this time it's always, someone like me 
 They uh, handcuff and shackle, and uh, throw away the key 
 (Every year about this time 
 There's someone like me 
 Every year about this time) About this time, uh 
 (They lock us up, and throw away the key) 
 Every year about this time-uh, oh what a pity 'ater 
 Spooky dark cloud lingers, over the city uh 
 Life and death does it, coincide 
 Will that, scared man live to tell how, that brave man died 
 A j-a-just the other day, coulda sworn I heard a brother say 
 White folks kill they parents, but black folks kill each other 
 You make the bed you lay in, if this is what you choose 
 But if you choose to cross the game, then I'd have to break the news uh 
 Sky-ballin and doin' dirt, not haulin dirt 
 I'm used to fast cash and big bucks, fuck construction work 
 And how can I make some sort of dividends 
 How can I get my mathematics, how can I get in where I fit in 
 How can I, get in get gone 
 Every year about this time it's always, someone like me 
 They uh, handcuff and shackle, and uh, throw away the key 
 Every year about this time it's always, someone like me 
 They uh, handcuff and shackle, and uh, throw away the key

 You think I'll ever be able to turn some of this dirty money 
 Into some clean money? 
 Get a bidness license maybe someday start a record company? 
 Good intentions but I, never follow through 
 I got good intentions but I, never follow through 
 Systemized, a big nigga for my shoe size, trust me I'll fuck you 
 You ain't from the hood nigga, so you ain't got a clue 
 If I ever strike it rich UHH, I ain't gon never move 
 'Cause I'm a pistol packin weed smokin', nigga witta attitude 
 How can I make some sort of dividend how can I 
 Get my mathematics on, how can I get in where I, fit in 
 How can I, get in get gone 
 Every year about this time it's always, someone like me 
 They uh, handcuff and shackle, and uh, throw away the key
