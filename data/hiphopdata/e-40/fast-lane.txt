Living the life in the quick lane only the strongest survive 
 These streets will swallow you up mayne, and eat you alive 
 Can't be no poodle, run tuck your tail and hide 
 They'll spaghetti your noodle, mayne, element of surprise 
 It's going around mayne, death in the air 
 Better not be scared cause hyenas can smell fear 
 There's not a lot of love but it's a whole lot of hate 
 Beware of your surroundings they're starving they ain't ate 
 The lick of fire awaits for those with no souls 
 Hot like a stove, hotter than hot coals 
 I'n not a knock, I'm the server, got hella clients waitin' 
 Fuck the FDA; the food and drug administration 
 That's the thought process of a soil soldier 
 6's on the [?] pistola, spinach and yola 
 I'm talking realer dope money this hustler makin' 
 And I don't cattin' and capin' and cupcakin' 
 I go bad on a batch man, I ain't playin' 
 Knock a broad without even lifting a hand 
 Ain't even gotta touch her, mind games mayne 
 Brain fuck her, I ain't lyin' 
 Never been a bitch-made motherfucker just a professional sucker-ducker 
 I'm one nigger rich motherfucker, courthouses and diamond clusters 
 Fucks with hustlers, not no busters allowed around us 
 No sap suckers, snitches, bitches, or punk cowards 
 Yeah, nigga having thangs 
 Fancy cars and rings 
 This hustler bout' his chains 
 Nigga really out here doin' it? (Doin' it) 
 Claimin' hella fame 
 Everybody know my name 
 I'm deep off in this game 
 Whatever money that I get to (Whatcha livin'?) 
 In the fastlane (x8) 
 Looking up with greenbacks on your mind is a good sign 
 My name ringing like a high school bell, like a church chime 
 This ain't chameleon, but go get a glass of wine 
 Listen to me preach my rhyme, sit back and recline 
 I'm too real to be unreal, too truthful to be fake 
 Daddy and mommy went they're separate ways when I was eight 
 But it made me great, more stronger and god-willing 
 A few years later, I'm worth a few million 
 Top billing, killing em' with my independent grip 
 Got rid of my digital scale and started making hits 
 Flipping all kinds of whips, Benzes, Cutlass, and Lexus's 
 Me and the clique of St. Charles, god was blessing us 
 Successfulness, all praises due to Allah 
 Jesus, Jahova, the most highest almighty god 
 Reverend Thurman and Mother Thurman, I miss you much 
 I know you up in heaven watching over us 
 If I can help people, that's what they taught me to do 
 Can't save the world, but I can help save a few 
 People talk behind my back, laugh and smiled all in my face 
 Said my voice was too squeaky and my style was a disgrace 
 Now I'm hittin', they ain't laughin' all the way to the bank 
 Making deposits and promoting my own track 
 Backing with my nose in the air, like my shit don't stank 
 Came in the game blindfolded, stressin', guessin', walking the plank
