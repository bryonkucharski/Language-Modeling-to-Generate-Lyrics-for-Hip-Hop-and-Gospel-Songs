Water, water, water, water 
 Water, water, water, water 
 I wish I was 40, I wish I was water 
 I wish I was 40, I wish I was water 
 I wish I was 40, I wish I was water 
 I wish I was 40, I wish I was water 
 40 different ways, 40 days, 40 nights 
 40 on the side, 40 thieves in the night 
 Been in the game for 20 years and I'm 40 years though? 
 6 A cougar, 40 years cold 
 40 ounce of brew, 40 this, 40 that 
 40 at the crap table shooting 40 stacks 
 40 thousands fans, 40 niggas on stage 
 I heard 40's 40 but 40 don't act his age 
 40 stay relevant, 40 ain't never played 
 40 ain't a punk, 40 will pull the gage 
 40 years change with the hawk sitting on her 
 40 ain't left the hood, 40 around the corner 
 40 like to drink, 40 be getting drunk 
 My brodies, a hip-o-holic, he smoke 40 blunts 
 40 kicks a blow, 40 pounds of grapes 
 Give me 40 feet and a ounce of space 
 Water, water, water, water 
 Water, water, water, water 
 I wish I was 40, I wish I was water 
 I wish I was 40, I wish I was water 
 I wish I was 40, I wish I was water 
 I wish I was 40, I wish I was water 
 This that new water, this shit go 
 Water my grass and my green gone grow 
 It takes water to live, it's water under the bridge 
 Water with the baking soda whipping up kids 
 It's a drought without water, the soil can't crack 
 Water in the duals makes loud glass packs 
 My family know me by Earl but water my handle 
 All the gooing in the club, drinking water like a camel 
 Put some paint where it ain't, water based paint 
 If you don't drink no water, my ninja, you might faint 
 Water be everywhere but water from the V 
 Water be limping like he got water in his knee 
 Water pour, water simmer, water heat 
 Keep my head above water, still water run deep 
 Water in my bong, water do the fruit 
 Water trust no one, ain't no leaks in my pool 
 Water, water, water, water 
 Water, water, water, water 
 I wish I was 40, I wish I was water 
 I wish I was 40, I wish I was water 
 I wish I was 40, I wish I was water 
 I wish I was 40, I wish I was water 
 I don't be seeing anything, I be making sense 
 Y'all be looking for a walk, I be swing for the fence 
 Under pressure, never tense, rhyming is a synch 
 Change the rap game when they let me up off the bench 
 Back with that 91 super Atlantic flow 
 I've done seen your favorite rappers come and go 
 I done seen a lot of blow, a lot of snow 
 I done seen my homie grandma get beat by the po-po 
 In the hill side of Vallejo, County of Selano 
 Get off a magazine and meet me over there by McDonald's 
 That's why I used to get my yola stacks off 
 Back then I was small time, all I had was rocks 
 Manage with it, a fixture on the streets 
 He a vegan, he don't like beef 
 They got their E's mixed up 
 I just look like this but I'd fuck a nigga up 
 Water, water, water, water 
 Water, water, water, water 
 I wish I was 40, I wish I was water 
 I wish I was 40, I wish I was water 
 I wish I was 40, I wish I was water 
 I wish I was 40, I wish I was water 
 I wish I was 40, I wish I was 
 I wish I was 40, I wish I was 
 I wish I was 40, I wish I was 
 I wish I was 40, I wish I was
