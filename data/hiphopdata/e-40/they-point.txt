Every time I stop, hoes like look at him 
 Every car I drive, niggas want one of them 
 They pointin', they pointin 
 They like dammmmmn 
 They pointin', they pointin 
 They like dammmmmn 
 Like Ricky Ross, everyday I'm hustlin' 
 Gettin' off weight (like who?) Jennifer Hudson 
 Pack a hammer, Thor 
 Shooter, score 
 Slide through batches think I'm hecka rich 
 Breakin' necks, turnin' heads like the exorcist 
 Thumbs up like the like button 
 Eatin' good, no rib touchin' 
 Runnin' with a bundle, never fumble 
 Countin' so much bread I got Carpal tunnel 
 Stock paint (from where?) Maaco 
 Beige, like a potato 
 They hate me on the outside, love me in the inside 
 Suck me in the back seat while I let a friend drive 
 Half a pound two stacks, half a unit 10-5 
 I stay out here by Sully so you know a hustler been fly 
 My pockets some'n serious, mansion on a hilly 
 Main that nigga got more cheese than a philly 
 Shoelace tied but a nigga still trippin' 
 I'm Lionel Richie high, I'm dancin' on the ceiling 
 Never marry a hoes, I just marry checks 
 That's how you stay on top, missionary sex 
 Rubberband business, know you heard of that 
 I got the town talkin', know you scurred of that 
 None less than ten figures, you know what I'm worth 
 Record sales, show money, not including merch' 
 Club full of bitches, pocket full of Franks 
 Blunt full of weed, cup full of drank 
 Me going raw dog, ain't no way in hell 
 Before I risk my life it be a cold day in hell 
 But bitch take it off, here we go show and tell 
 And I'm fuckin' that pussy like I'm fresh out of jail 
 Parallel park while I'm ghost riding 
 Black diamonds man I'm racial profiling 
 I'm so fly man I need a co-pilot 
 So I might let your damn ho drive it 
 Lil' hair pullin' man I like rough sex 
 Dropped out, I ain't never passed a drug test 
 You know my lingo baby let's mingle 
 So I got a thousand dollars worth of singles 
 I got racks in the cargo of my camels 
 Still, still won't give her Nathaniel 
 Life a gamble so I had to make a bet 
 These ain't Air Max but make a check 
 They took me out the streets but it's still in me 
 I been sellin' work since we had Bill Clinton 
 I'm the voice of the streets so they still listen 
 On the back of the milk carton, ceiling missing
