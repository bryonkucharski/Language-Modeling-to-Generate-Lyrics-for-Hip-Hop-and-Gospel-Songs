 Uh, the beat is excoriating 
 Your libel to find me up at an old school ?? and ?? 
 Scooting and skating, beating and quaking, waking up the ave 
 With a yellow bone the same complexion as a cab 
 Money on my agenda ever since I came out the placenta, blowing and puffing on this indicia 
 I'm a movie, I'm a cinema, motion picture gold figure. 7 figure nigga 
 Just because I rap, don't think I won't squeeze the trigga' 
 Not a barber but I pack an extra clippa' 
 Put you in your place 
 Send a couple of crash dummy, open up your face 
 I'm addicted to this fast money rushing like race 
 Fuckin' around with the baking soda not that toothpaste 
 Imma do it till its doomsday, till the day I'm sentenced 
 In the meantime in between time, speak your money into existence 
 Speak your money into existence, talking it up 
 Man you gone live a long time, that's what's up 
 All up 'n' ya ear, rockin' like bamboo 
 Rockin' like, rockin' like, bamboo 
 Rockin' like, rockin' like, bamboo 
 Bam bam bamboo 
 Bam bam bamboo 
 Bam bam bamboo 
 Bam bam bamboo 
 Bam bam bamboo 
 Bam bam bamboo 
 Bam bam bamboo 
 Bam bam bamboo 
 Uh, first off, we the opposite of soft. 
 We love to get twisted like fingers crossed 
 We stay smoking like bad exhaust 
 Raculini?, Zucchini, aviation, vegetation 
 Broken English, distinguish E40's translation 
 Protection my weapon of choice, magical 
 Walther ppq m2, tactical 
 I like guns with bolt action, like mossberg 
 So intruders, they'll get what they deserve 
 Everybody in my platoon in a tycoon for sure 
 Trips to Jamaica, vacation buy up the top floor 
 I got ears, I be spitting a minute? bitch. 
 Wordsmith got a cold sales pitch 
 I can sell paper to a tree, water to the sea, snow to Tahoe, chips to Bellagio 
 Fuckin' Halle Berry's on my bucket list, I'll stick my tongue in her pussy lips 
 All up 'n' ya ear, rockin' like bamboo 
 Rockin' like, rockin' like, bamboo 
 Rockin' like, rockin' like, bamboo 
 Bam bam bamboo 
 Bam bam bamboo 
 Bam bam bamboo 
 Bam bam bamboo 
 Bam bam bamboo 
 Bam bam bamboo 
 Bam bam bamboo 
 Bam bam bamboo 
 Waking' 'em up, waking' 'em up 
 Waking' 'em up, waking' 'em up 
 Waking' 'em up, waking' 'em up 
 All up in their ear like, bamboo 
 Bamboo (bamboo) Bamboo (bamboo) 
 Bamboo (bamboo) Bamboo (bamboo) 
 Bamboo (bamboo) Bamboo (bamboo)
