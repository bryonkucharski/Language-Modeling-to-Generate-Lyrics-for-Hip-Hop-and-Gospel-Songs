Ex D-Boy used to sell that girl 
 Now they know my name all across the world 
 They say Earl, Earl, they say Earl, Earl 
 Ex D-Boy used to sell that girl 
 Now they know my name all across the world 
 They say Earl, Earl, they say Earl, Earl 
 I'm from Vallejo, California, land of the homer 
 Sides lost lives, politics and drama 
 Over supersize, thump young in a hornya 
 Watch out for that boy in the hoodie, mane, he a monster 
 Light a sucker up, fried buster like Chimichanga 
 Somebody come scoop his ass, call a coroner 
 I guess that's the way we bread 
 Chemical babies mislead 
 It's spooky out here in the Yay 
 These goblins will get on your head 
 These thundacat's management ain't scared to be deceased 
 They always cover up they ears 
 When I'm yelling and hollering out peace 
 They going through it, they cranky 
 Stressed out and tense 
 They starving, they hungry 
 They eating soup with chopsticks 
 Plus it's a shortage on purple 
 And it's a drought on them bricks 
 So he'll go decide to do a kick door 
 And pull a few licks 
 Some of them parents on drugs 
 Some of them never been loved 
 Some of them want to be thugs 
 Some of them just need a hug 
 Ex D-Boy used to sell that girl 
 Now they know my name all across the world 
 They say Earl, Earl, they say Earl, Earl 
 Ex D-Boy used to sell that girl 
 Now they know my name all across the world 
 They say Earl, Earl, they say Earl, Earl 
 I'mma be around for a minute 
 So get used to it, I was through with it 
 Before most of you marshmallows knew want to do with it 
 Pushing them zones, serving that drome 
 Balling like I play hoop with it 
 Never at home, always be gone 
 Doing a show on the verse split 
 Let it be known, I tote my chrome 
 Refuse to get caught loose with it 
 Looking down at my shoe with it, I'mma real baboon with it 
 40 over there slipping, he snoozing, he ain't wake 
 He looking like a plate, he chipped up and draped 
 You fuck niggas got me fucked up, nigga, I'm a shooter 
 Think about the consequences, nigga, I got gouda 
 And niggas with gouda will send a nigga, fuck a case 
 'Cause niggas with gouda will have your whole family erased 
 But that ain't something I endorse 
 I only wore it by force 
 I'm trying to teach the youth to be loyal and play sports 
 Instead of in and out of court 
 And back and forth to prison, utilize they skills 
 And stay up out the system 
 Ex D-Boy used to sell that girl 
 Now they know my name all across the world 
 They say Earl, Earl, they say Earl, Earl 
 Ex D-Boy used to sell that girl
