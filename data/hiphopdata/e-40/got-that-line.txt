Niggas want that old mob shit back 
 (Take it back to that old school Federal way, man. Understand.) 
 For all my mob music monsters 
 (In a major way. I'm still burning duct tape.) 
 Bitch! 
 Nigga, this rap shit slow? 
 I'll be back selling blow 
 Posted right there by the store 
 Selling narcotics for the low 
 Niggas think I fell off? 
 Niggas done lost they mind 
 Niggas think since I'm rapping now 
 I still got that line 
 Still got that line 
 Still got that line 
 Nigga still got that line 
 Who got that line? 
 Who got that line? (I still got it, man.) 
 Nigga still got that line 
 Still got that line 
 Still got that line (Who need it?) 
 Nigga still got that line

 In the traffic, in the wind getting money 
 Never stunting clumsy gotta feed my family tummy 
 Ain't shit here funny 
 Pull your ho card, not a game motherfucker, this ain't gin rummy 
 It's funky out here - musty, keep your guns oiled up, not rusty 
 Not a starter pistol; pack something husky, bust the gusty 
 Sawed-off, something that'll get your point across 
 Knock a motherfucker head off; tomato soup, not chicken broth 
 Promethazine, no cough; six-fifty with a brick of boat cost 
 If coke cost too much so I'm charging 
 Twenty-four, five for the margarine 
 I might bargain, or show you love for the butter 
 Peel your broccoli, give you a better price than your little plug 
 You could lose your life, catch a fucking slug, plotting on a balling-ass thug 
 I stay with the pyro on me cause ain't nobody gonna protect me like me 
 I don't want no cowards around me, big bank, FDIC

 With a hard ass kick of that blow (that snow), OG having his cho (money) 
 Another word for cho is doe (fetti), trying to outsmart the po-po (Five-O) 
 Come looking for me and I gotta go (what you do?) I'm running through the store back door 
 Knocking over candy and chips, commenced to hit the fence 
 It's not my first offense, about my dollars and sense 
 I like to trap and trench, we like to trench and trap 
 Everybody with me don't rap 
 Operation gouda stack, [sic], in this world of pain no patch 
 Pain reliever disbeliever, push Keisha, pack a 40-caliber gat 
 Got ho no more, toe-to-toe, don't nobody wanna fight no more 
 Throw it all away over a ho, never see the light no more 
 Ninety-nine plants I grow, got vegetables, outdoor seaweed, spinach 
 I'm not a save-a-ho, I'll break a ho, don't be surprised if I take your bi-nitch

 Survival tactics, never hustling backwards 
 Throw-off methods, that's why I wear these glasses 
 So I can look like a nerd, po-po roll right past us 
 Savage-ass nigga from the gravel 
 Baller status, living hella lavish 
 You can find me at the shooting range, target practice 
 With a thumper in my fist going tactical 
 Shaka Zulu heart built for battle 
 Free all of my real ones missing summers 
 In the stew doing football numbers 
 Caught my brody with a K and some methamphetamine 
 Didn't take the plea bargain, so they gave him all day 
 All his family can do now is pray 
 Hoping they reduce his stay 
 Pass the hat around for the lawyer pay 
 Get him out before he hella old and gray 
 One day, I'm a probably be a deacon on the alter 
 Hopefully, I don't have to break bad like Walter 
 Get my hands dirty again and push birds 
 Either that or that windshield glass Heisenberg 
 Same toilet, different terd, I'll serve if I'm down on my revenue 
 Call the neighborhood chef, Raul
