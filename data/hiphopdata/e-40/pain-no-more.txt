(Feat. The Game and Snoop Dogg) 
 I'm doing everything I can to get my buzz on 
 Trying not to feel this pain no more 
 That's why I'm pooping these pills and smoking this dro 
 And drinking this Henney straight 
 Trying not to feel this pain no more 
 (Verse 1: E-40) 
 I came from the bottom of the barrel, to everyday new apparel 
 From a shoe string budget to more jewelry than a pharaoh 
 Up out a place called Vallejo, house smaller than a hut 
 First city in California to go bankrupt 
 Came a long way, let the truth be told 
 Penitentiary chances sweating over the stove 
 Seen them come and go, I'm the last of my crop 
 Don't compare me to nobody unless you're talking bout Pac 
 Just trying to survive and stay alive, so many of my people done died 
 Nowadays, you're an O.G. if you live to be 25 
 My partner in there with his grand-daddy doing 25 
 Lifting water bags, doing burpees exercise 
 I hand pick my friends cause people ain't trustable 
 Feelings like broads, their motives is questionable 
 Suckers sneak diss me and call me up on the phone 
 They say, '40 Water, I just wanna be on' 
 I'm doing everything I can to get my buzz on 
 Trying not to feel this pain no more 
 That's why I'm pooping these pills and smoking this dro 
 And drinking this Henney straight 
 Trying not to feel this pain no more 
 (Verse 2: Game) 
 They say money makes the world go round 
 And since I'm worth twenty mil, I wanna see this bitch spin like the rims on a schwinn 
 Hop on that bike, ride through the neighborhood 
 Compton on smash, them boys get Cash Money like Baby do 
 I got a scar over my heart, cause that's what hating'll do 
 So watch your back like a tattoo artist 
 A coffin don't fuck about who the hardest 
 You lay where the people who mourn pray 
 Get your name etched in stones with your born day 
 Small talk over a glass of Grand Marnier 
 As I sip from the glass, my mind starts packing this Louis Vuitton bag 
 Take a trip to the past, hear that shot going blast 
 See my brother lying dormant, IV's in his arms 
 Can't you see he got a piss bag 
 17 years old, and you niggaz wonder why I'm so cold 
 I'm doing everything I can to get my buzz on 
 Trying not to feel this pain no more 
 That's why I'm pooping these pills and smoking this dro 
 And drinking this Henney straight 
 Trying not to feel this pain no more 
 (Verse 3: Snoop Dogg) 
 Let me get a fifth of some brandy, a plate of some candy 
 Cindy, Sandy, Mindy Mandy 
 Tina, Brandy, Keisha, Angie 
 Man we, can't we all get along 
 Two shots of Patron, I did it till the break of dawn 
 Big fish in a pond, running my triathlon 
 Doggy Dogg keep the bone 
 One of a kind, blow you mind 
 Just like Einstein, born to shine 
 I'm getting mine prime time like 21 
 Get 'er done, everything in my life, I make it look like fun 
 Everyday of my life, I'm trying get my buzz on 
 Cause on some other shit, I'm keeping it on the under bitch 
 So much pain I overcame, same thang 
 Me, E-40, and Game came from the same gang 
 But you wouldn't understand 
 I'm populating with my? 's translation 
 That's my main man, let me hit that damn thang 
 I'm doing everything I can to get my buzz on 
 Trying not to feel this pain no more 
 That's why I'm pooping these pills and smoking this dro 
 And drinking this Henney straight 
 Trying not to feel this pain no more
