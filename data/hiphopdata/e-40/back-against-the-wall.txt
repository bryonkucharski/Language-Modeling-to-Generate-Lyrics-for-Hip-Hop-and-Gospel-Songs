(Feat. Master P) 
 (E-40) 
 Tryin' to make it... 
 It's been a long road 
 Sic-Wid-It Records 
 (Master P & E-40) 
 UNNNNNNNNNGGGGGHHHHH! (C'mon, ooh) 
 Y'all feel that? (I feel it playboy, I smell you) 
 It's real out here 40 (It's real Pee!) 
 (E-40) 
 I'm out here in the slums where thugs be usin', ghetto tactics 
 Like, choppin up candy canes 
 Sittin' on top of a dried up JCPenney day mattress 
 Whatever it takes to survive, see that's what I supply 
 Like slippin and slidin in the grocery store 
 And settling out of court 
 Soft white coke a black turn into hard solidses 
 Thirty-eight snub nosed pistol grip lay nijjas on they wah-wah 
 The saga continues, the struggle's just beginnin 
 And it's hard to look up to snotty folks, cause THEY be sinnin 
 'Pac gone, Biggie gone, Seagram gone -- and we also lost Eazy-E 
 One of the first gangster rappers of all time 
 To the most vicious and deadliest disease in history since cancer 
 To Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, tombstone 
 From the graveyard shift, RBL's Mister C 
 One love, to Rappin' Ron and Plann B 
 Victims of the trigger (unnngggggggghhhhhh) 
 Po' out a little liquor 
 Chorus: repeat 2X 
 It's not the same, this world is crazy 
 We out here goin' through it all 
 Everything must change, it's gettin' shady 
 Got our backs against the wall 
 (Master P) 
 UNGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHH, I shed tears for pain 40, some for anger 
 Seen bloodshed by crooked cops, and gangbangers 
 Feel my pain (unnnggghhh) only time'll change it 
 And fast money, cars, and bitches got me trapped in this game 
 And my lil' homies ballin, picture me fallin' 
 And momma in the funeral screamin and crawlin 
 Is there a heaven or hell? 
 To ghetto kids in the anky only time will tell 
 And jealousy, and envy, come with money 
 While crooked, politicians, run the country 
 And it's a, damn shame to see my, weeples vanish 
 Now they teach us ebonics, what about English and Spanish 
 I couldn't, live my life behind bars and gates 
 While the government play a game called process to eliminate 
 (E-40) 
 Case #246, shootin in an inhabited area 
 They was steady complainin about the dope sellin 
 But they ain't never been evicted, or convicted 
 They ain't never been subpeonaed to court, or arrested 
 Shackled like an animal for pushin rocks 
 Dang near choked to death by motorcycle cops 
 Pepper sprayed and laughed at like that shit was funny 
 Pregnant breezy threw down on her tummy 
 Do you ever think I'll ever be able to get 
 A chance to repent and ask the lord for forgiveness 
 Before he close the casket, will my son end up growin' up 
 Without a father will he end up bein a bastard? 
 A bastard -- that's a good question (unggggggggghhhh!) 
 I don't know, I don't know
