I punch the gas, I hit the brakes 
 I punch the gas, I hit the brakes 
 I punch the gas, I hit the brakes 
 I punch the gas, I hit the brakes 
 The poor man's hydraulics 
 The poor man's hydraulics 
 The poor man's hydraulics 
 The poor man's hydraulics 
 Yokin' it up, tearin' it up 
 Wakin' 'em up, showin' my butt 
 Serving some weight, having my cake 
 Acting a ape, smoking my grapes 
 Lifted and splifted, whiskeyed and twisted 
 Me and my niggas get it and fit it 
 Makin' 'em mad, makin' 'em sad 
 Love to boast, love to brag 
 Slangin' them raps, selling these tracks 
 Up in ya broad, up in ya batch 
 My trunk is throbbing, my system knock 
 My amps is making my woofers pop 
 Fully refurbished, fully restored 
 70' cutlass sticking the floor 
 Turfin' and crumpin', snapping and stepping 
 Trappin' and slumming, bangin' and reppin' 
 I punch the gas, I hit the brakes 
 I punch the gas, I hit the brakes 
 I punch the gas, I hit the brakes 
 I punch the gas, I hit the brakes 
 The poor man's hydraulics 
 The poor man's hydraulics 
 The poor man's hydraulics 
 The poor man's hydraulics 
 Get it to the right, get it to the left 
 Make your tires bounce like a insufficient check 
 Make your car dance like a dance contest 
 Do some acrobatics till it lead to your arrest 
 Exciting, joyriding 
 High siding, big timing 
 Brand new shocks, rebuilt motor 
 What color paint is that, chocolate mocha? 
 Chrome lips, chrome tips 
 Chrome everywhere, chrome on my hip 
 Reputable, intellectual 
 I'm trying to fit you in my schedule 
 Sticking and moving, reducing my prices 
 Adjusting my rates, bringin' new clients 
 Checking my traps, running my route 
 Collecting my snaps, peeling on out 
 I punch the gas, I hit the brakes 
 I punch the gas, I hit the brakes 
 I punch the gas, I hit the brakes 
 I punch the gas, I hit the brakes 
 The poor man's hydraulics 
 The poor man's hydraulics 
 The poor man's hydraulics 
 The poor man's hydraulics 
 Get it off the ground 
 Get it off the ground 
 Get it off the ground 
 Get it off the ground 
 Get it off the ground 
 Get it off the ground 
 Get it off the ground 
 Get it off the ground 
 Look at me squat, look at me mash 
 Look at me yoke, look at me smash 
 Oh, me, I ain't playin' 
 Oh, me, I'm my biggest fan 
 Me no cupcake, me no mark 
 Me no sucka, me got heart 
 289,454 
 Fresh outta impound, fresh outta tow 
 He so foolish, I concur 
 Roger that, aye, aye sir 
 Unusual slump, dinormous slap 
 He off a blunt, he on that yacht 
 Show casing, car racing 
 Ice skating, lane changing 
 Heads or tails, flipping a coin 
 Bill of sales everyday morn 
 I punch the gas, I hit the brakes 
 I punch the gas, I hit the brakes 
 I punch the gas, I hit the brakes 
 I punch the gas, I hit the brakes 
 The poor man's hydraulics 
 The poor man's hydraulics 
 The poor man's hydraulics 
 The poor man's hydraulics 
 I punch the gas, I hit the brakes 
 I punch the gas, I hit the brakes 
 I punch the gas, I hit the brakes 
 I punch the gas, I hit the brakes 
 The poor man's hydraulics 
 The poor man's hydraulics 
 The poor man's hydraulics 
 The poor man's hydraulics 
 Get it off the ground 
 Get it off the ground 
 Get it off the ground 
 Get it off the ground 
 Get it off the ground 
 Get it off the ground 
 Get it off the ground 
 Get it off the ground
