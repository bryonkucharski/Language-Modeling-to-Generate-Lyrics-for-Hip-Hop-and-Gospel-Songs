I use colorful words, you've probably heard 
 From somebody else's lyrics, but really it's my spit 
 I come from the streets, I'm not from the burbs 
 Although I stay in the burbs, I come from the streets 
 Money hungry hustlers tryin' to make ends meet 
 Stingy young brothas when we walk we sqeak 
 Have money, have street, have heart 
 I ain't tryin' to bunt, I'm trying to go out the park 
 I'm on deck, Sick Wid It Records I rep 
 I'm a vet but I spit like a youngster from the set 
 I ain't trippin', I knew it was political 
 They left us out 'tha Top 50, me and Mystikal 
 I rap fast but you can quote my rhymes 
 The greatest game spitter of all time 
 The most underrated rapper in the game 
 But everybody wanna use my slang 
 I don't know what they was thinkin' 
 When they thought what they was thinkin' 
 But they shouldn't have thought that 
 I've been a hustla since birth 
 So when the haul me off and put me up in that hearse 
 Remember this here verse, I did a song with Fred Durst 
 As far as the independent underground scene I was the first 
 To get a big deal, couple a mil and some mo 
 See that was some change, that was some scrilla back in '94 
 Playa been eatin off that bill for a while 
 Always dig me I never change my style 
 I gave it to ya raw and uncut, 75% of the words I made it up 
 You ask me why I speak the real way I feel 
 How come E-40 so groovy, and y'all so game goofy 
 Partly from the fact that I'm a force 
 They never put me on the cover of The Source 
 Next day, they can't trace the calls 
 I change numbers like a playa changes draw's 
 I'm havin' money, money long stretch like a bungee 
 When Easter comes around ask the Easter Bunny 
 (Easter Bunny do know E-40?) 
 Bet you that playa says "That's the homie" 
 Ya likely to find me on the Ave, or on the main drag 
 Or on the corner sippin 'gnac out of a brown paper bag 
 I don't need no iron, I'm already creased 
 Enough game to sell sand to a beach 
 Enough game to sell a hooker to a priest 
 Enough game to sell Rickey Rock in Scotty's (??????) 
 I rap fast but you can quote my rhymes 
 The greates game spitter of all time 
 The most underrated rapper in the game 
 But everybody wanna use my slang
