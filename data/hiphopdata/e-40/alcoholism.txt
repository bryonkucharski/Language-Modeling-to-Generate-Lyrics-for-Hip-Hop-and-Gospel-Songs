 Pull this bitch over, my nigga, I got to piss 
 I stay with some sip in my fist, I drink like a fish 
 Sometimes I be sober but most the times I be blitzed 
 I'm having my gouda, my nigga, all on her bitch 
 We ball like we hoopers, my nigga, we hood rich 
 We winning not losing, my fella, we got chips 
 I keep me a steak or a pistol, a grip four 5th 
 'Cause I'd rather be judged by 12 then to be carried by 6 
 Don't wanna be carried by 6, I'd rather be judged by 12 
 Suckas be all in my mix 'cause I be up in their girl 
 Don't know how to rewrite bail, I can add and count scales 
 I can sell a rock to a cliff, I can sell oil to a well 
 Yay area reppin', don't need no swagger injection 
 Big oceans 11, hustling and money collecting 
 I'm shattered, I'm blundered, mane, I been chiefing that feda 
 The po-po's they tripping, mane, they sobriety checking

 The fur fur is crazy, lucky, I have me a desi 
 A designated driver, a rider, we in it heavy 
 We knocking 40 Water, he foolish, the boy gone 
 That's all they played was his music when I was in a group home 
 'Bout to go shoot some balls, shoot some dominoes with my fellas 
 Get on that patron, call Stella, Ella and Della 
 10 to get on the board, I'm fresh off the top 
 If I skunk you, my ninja, you gotta drink two shots 
 Or we can play for some fedi or we can play for push-ups 
 Or we can put on the gloves go from the shoulders and box 
 After that we can hug and get a room with props 
 All my fellas is thugs, ball-heads and dreadlocks 
 Right after the function, they continue to get bent 
 Last weekend was smacking, my nigga, that shit went 
 I left outta there with not one but two women 
 I guess you can blame it, mane, on the alcoholism

 1300 block ready rock animal sitting in the coupe 
 Orange like cantaloupe, something on the mantel fold 
 Gears in the rear, old English Beer 
 Makes it hard to steer 
 I been getting fucked up since 9th 10 grade 
 Bird and grape cool aid and ace of spades 
 I swerved and I do thangs against the grain 
 And I guess this the money we gave to champagne 
 I pulled in the lot, bullets in the glock 
 Hot or not we like to shoot shots 
 Stop where I'm hot and I like to drink shots 
 And I'm gone off the Julio at the 20th and what not 
 You can say what you say, Imma paper boy 
 Little waves up top with the table, boy 
 She be playing hard to get but you can make them, boy 
 Put some drink in her cup and watch her swish it up
