I'd like to thank the mack god for all tha playa prophets that he sent 
 I'd like to thank him for Donald Going and Iceberg Slim 
 For dottin their I's and crossin their T's, poppin' their P's, and 
 Flexin their G's 
 I'd like to thank the mack god for all the playa prophets that he 
 Sent before me and 40 water 
 For the mack I chose 40 water 
 To come into the world and change and rearrange 
 To lace the suckers and the anti playa 
 He came in the middle of the Atlantic ocean, on the glad sandwich bag 
 And floated ashore 
 And as soon as he hit the shore, he balanced the game 
 He said that nine-tenths of his law was possession 
 And that nine-tenths of his game was position 
 And that everything was done on the approach 
 The mack god said that he would send an extraordinary one 
 On the side of 40 water and he won't just be a playa 
 He will be an extraordinary playa 
 Now we gonna turn the mack book from page 211 to chapter 187 
 And it talks about how they had a kangaroo court for the playas 
 And how dem suckas is out there with trumped up charged on E-40 
 Well, if you wanna judge the 40 water, bring him before 12 G's 
 And open his files 
 And you will see that he has been true with a capital T since he 
 Was knee high to a grasshopper 
 That the mack god said that in the year 1555, that there was a 
 Great explosion and some of the playas inhaled some fumes 
 Pertaining additives, preservatives and artificial flavors 
 The mack god refers to them as suckas 
 And he said that he would send one that would come from one 
 That was despised and rejected 
 And that he would send this extraordinary one in the world 
 And when he come, he would come with ten commandments 
 And the commandments would be: 
 Thou shall not snitch 
 Thou shall not infiltrate 
 Thou shall not perpetrate 
 Thou shall not playa hate 
 Thou shall not hold trust 
 Thou shall not hold say 
 Thou shall not pay a trick 
 Thou shall not disrespect the game 
 Thou shall not be broke 
 And thou shall not be without their thang 
 The mack god said that just because you meet a hoe 
 And she wears a jersey that say champion and eat a bowl of wheaties 
 Don't make her a winner 
 Will she sell her hips, her lips and her fingertips 
 Will you tear down doors 
 And knock out CO's 
 Can you go the distance 
 Will you be the one with the checkered flag in your hand 
 Yeah, 'cause I will be the winner
