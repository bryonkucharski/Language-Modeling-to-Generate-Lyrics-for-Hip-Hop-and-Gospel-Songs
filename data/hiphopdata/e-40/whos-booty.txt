Slide in that thang, good D game 
 Bust it so good, girl what's my name? 
 Hit it from the back, headboard swag 
 When I talk shit shorty answer right back 
 I be on her like 
 Who booty is it? Who booty is it? 
 Who booty? Who booty? Who booty is it? 
 Who booty is it? Who booty is it? 
 Who booty? Who booty? Who booty is it? 
 Lil mama I know what you want, 
 Begging me to beat it like the bass in my trunk. 
 I'm a little nasty, I ain't even gotta front. 
 Lick you from your head down, down to your butt. 
 I Mike Tyson that booty, I knock that ass out. 
 Crackin' that pookie, you make me spazz out. 
 Let me get in that, baby throw it back. 
 Let me get a round of applause, make, make it clap.

 See the firework, hundred bottles here 
 You know we're flying over here 
 And then we flying over there

 Big old boot, pull up thongs 
 Whips and shoes, something fun
