Sixty-eight inches above sea level 
 Ninety-three million miles above these devils 
 Play me in the winter, play me in the summer 
 Play me in the order, any order 
 Play me in the winter, play me in the summer 
 Play me in the order, any order 
 Play me in the winter, play me in the summer 
 Play me in the order, any order 
 We got another one pimp 
 Rock, wake 'em up, boy 
 Sick with 'em records, E40, Warner Brothers 
 I'm trying to get my beak wet 
 I'ma let you shoot the dice and I'm a sign that 
 Still hungry just ate 
 My game the same size as a dinner plate 
 The bay ain't been the same since I took a break 
 Where you been 40, buying real estate? 
 I can't stop 
 Play me fast, fuck around and get mollywopped 
 Just got my car up out the shop 
 What color you paint it pimp? Apricot 
 You 'bout to spot me at a function with a petticoat 
 Wipin' the sweat off my face with a C-Note 
 They call me uncle 40 one 
 The ambassador, the top tamale 
 And to you slackers tryna' hate 
 40 [Incomprehensible] doin' great 
 I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador 
 I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador 
 I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador 
 I'm the ambassador of the game 
 I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador 
 I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador 
 I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador 
 I'm the ambassador of the game 
 Play me in the winter, play me in the summer 
 I'm an old schooler and a newcomer 
 40 got spinach y'all, he be gassin' 
 After all these years he still snappin' 
 That's what people be sayin' 
 There's something about him, he got some dylon rings 
 Real balkin', people really care about him 
 Local boy made good 
 Ex D-boy made it out the hood 
 Got his gouda out the park 
 Used to cook yola in a relish jar 
 If a sucka' pillow talk and softies out the water 
 Don't you sit there and let him murder mouth yo' partna' 
 Teach his ass a lesson 
 Tune him up, give him the thirty-second treatment 
 I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador 
 I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador 
 I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador 
 I'm the ambassador of the game 
 I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador 
 I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador 
 I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador 
 I'm the ambassador of the game 
 I live in the Bay with the sting rays and sharks 
 Delta a'eels, blind veels and sky marks 
 You can't be no mark 
 Marshmallows get popped if they ain't got no heart 
 Thumper happy, I hear they like to clap 
 Don't get mad or come back, get down where they mad at 
 We'll finish it if you start it 
 Air the club out like a motherfucka', park it 
 Money maniac 
 Scorpio, that's my zodiac 
 Ain't nothin' new under the sun 
 I reach in my pocket and give my one to the bums 
 When the homie go down 
 We bail his ass out, we pass the hat around 
 I remember when the thought the west was a goner 
 I gave us CPR and brought us out of coma 
 I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador 
 I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador 
 I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador 
 I'm the ambassador of the game 
 I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador 
 I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador 
 I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador 
 I'm the ambassador of the game 
 Play me in the winter, play me in the summer 
 Play me in the order, any order 
 Play me in the winter, play me in the summer 
 Play me in the order, any order 
 Play me in the winter, play me in the summer 
 Play me in the order, any order 
 Play me in the winter, play me in the summer 
 Play me in the order, any order
