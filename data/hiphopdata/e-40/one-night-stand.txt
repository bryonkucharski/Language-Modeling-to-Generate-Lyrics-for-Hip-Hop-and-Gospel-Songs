E-40 -one night stand 
 Let's go baby girl let's go 
 Let's get the mother fucking flow baby girl let's go 
 Everybody in the club on the floor for sure 
 Let's get some mother fucking slap on that's for sure 
 Let's go baby girl let's go 
 Let's get the mother fucking flow baby girl let's go 
 All my nigas in the club on the floor for sure 
 Let's get some mother fucking slap on that's for sure 
 Never running outta lingo 
 40 water right back at 'em with another single 
 Money longer than the neck on a flamingo 
 20,000 dollar bet in the casino 
 I got a partner on parole that just got out of chino 
 Not a rookie but a vet like dan marino 
 My favorite actor on the set al pacino 
 This is a heater man, hot like jalepeno 
 Follow the leader 
 40 from califoolya you hearing in your speaker 
 My life ain't no cartoon it's not animated like seta 
 Hot like a hot air balloonist I'm just an opportunist 
 The sooner the better you let me know that we can do this 
 Excuse me lady I been lookin' at you from over here 
 And I was wondering if I could buy you a beer 
 And maybe later we can cud, 
 I don't want to be your man 
 I don't want to be the one let's have a one night stand 
 I know I don't know you and stuff 
 But maybe we could get to know each other 
 Over a couple of glasses of whatever's in this cup 
 I don't wanna go and dance 
 I don't wanna be the one let's have a one night stand 
 Let's get it cracking like some broken bones, money mackin' 
 Talkin' on them burnout phones, cadillacin' 
 Wood grain dash, and doors and floor mats 
 Good game cash, I stash the store raps 
 PS2 clarity, diamond watches and super bam botches 
 Eclair and cotches and choppers fresh out the boxes 
 I like to polish my rims and tires 
 Hundred spokes wide 
 With armoral baby wipes cause my baby drink wine 
 Nothing but the best on the flesh, just like sex 
 Rubbin lotion all on her gluteus maximus 
 I don't see no ring all I see is miss 60 jeans 
 Walking through the club like she ready to do some things 
 Full of that turtle, got 40 smelling like skunk 
 But everybody knows you can't smell yourself when your drunk 
 Posted at the bar I'm a star I get a bar 
 2-way me you'r number I'll give a player a card 
 This is for my fuckers who lets in all my guys 
 There's a new rapper in town E40's on the rise 
 Known for having sic wit it records and jive ties 
 Business men always at work like barry white 
 The guy with all the slang in the game about the yey 
 Gorillaz, marine world Africa USA 
 You feel us, it's sick out here in the bay where we stay 
 You kill us, I wish that somebody would come and pray 
 Live life like there ain't no tomorrow, ain't no tomorrow 
 Life is something that you can't borrow, that you can't borrow 
 Everyday's a holiday 
 Everyday may we celebrate 
 Everyday we modulate 
 Everyday may we perculate 
 Let's go baby girl let's go 
 Let's get the mother fucking flow baby girl let's go 
 Everybody in the club on the floor for sure 
 Let's get some mother fucking slap on that's for sure 
 Let's go baby girl let's go 
 Let's get the mother fucking flow baby girl let's go 
 All my nigas in the club on the floor for sure 
 Let's get some mother fucking slap on that's for sure
