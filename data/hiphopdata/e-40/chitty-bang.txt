Ya baby momma love me, ya baby daddy hate me 
 Ya bitch wanna fuck me, I said ya bitch wanna fuck 
 And we gon' get it like 
 Chitty, chitty, bang, bang 
 Chitty, chitty, bang, bang 
 Chitty, chitty, bang, bang 
 Chitty, chitty, bang, bang, whoa oh! 
 I made a detour out of the game when I was hustlin' crack 
 Made a couple of dollars, made a little bit of change, never looked back 
 You could find me at the shooter range, practicing bussin' gats 
 Or in the vocal booth, in this new studio, bussin' raps 
 With some gold on my body, out my body, off Carlos Rossi 
 I'm sloppy, I treat my luxury scraper like a Bugatti 
 La di da di, she like to party off molly, Bacardi 
 Love to get naughty, a hottie, up in the lobby, she stopped me 
 She said "40 Water, where you 'bout to be?" 
 I said "Follow me, follow me, follow me, bitch, room 223" 
 You got to pay me or pay no attention, that's how it be 
 When you born and raised in the V, Northern Cali, Silicon Valley 
 Ya baby momma love me, ya baby daddy hate me 
 Ya bitch wanna fuck me, I said ya bitch wanna fuck 
 And we gon' get it like 
 Chitty, chitty, bang, bang 
 Chitty, chitty, bang, bang 
 Chitty, chitty, bang, bang 
 Chitty, chitty, bang, bang, whoa oh! 
 Paid nigga, yeah, I make it happen, turnin' up, ratchet 
 Thick chick under my arm make your chick look average 
 Thick bitch, yeah, a big ol' ass, poke it like a cactus 
 And she got a face that belongs up in a beauty pageant 
 It's ya boy, Juicy J, trippy, I got realer pimps 
 Balling hard everyday, ratchet bitches can't resist 
 I stay laughing to the bank but my dough ain't funny 
 I run out of rap before I run out of money 
 When I pop a pill, that's foreplay 
 Now I'm all in her face like Olay 
 I'm like "okay", I kill the pussy like OJ 
 When I'm finished with ya woman, she gon' think we sold mints 
 Ya baby momma love me, ya baby daddy hate me 
 Ya bitch wanna fuck me, I said ya bitch wanna fuck 
 And we gon' get it like 
 Chitty, chitty, bang, bang 
 Chitty, chitty, bang, bang 
 Chitty, chitty, bang, bang 
 Chitty, chitty, bang, bang, whoa oh! 
 You wanna be around the winners? (A winner) 
 Say you only had a few niggas? (A few of 'em) 
 Girl, I'm just being honest (honest) 
 I know what you want and he's not it (not it) 
 I'm off the shits and I'm wit' it (wit' it, mane) 
 They can't stop us, we gon' get it (get it, mane) 
 I'm just being honest (honest) 
 I know what she want and he's not it 
 That's why 
 Ya baby momma love me, ya baby daddy hate me 
 Ya bitch wanna fuck me, I said ya bitch wanna fuck 
 And we gon' get it like 
 Chitty, chitty, bang, bang 
 Chitty, chitty, bang, bang 
 Chitty, chitty, bang, bang 
 Chitty, chitty, bang, bang, whoa oh!
