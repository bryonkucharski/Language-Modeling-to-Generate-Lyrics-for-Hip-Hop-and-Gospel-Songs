If I got rich one day, I won the lotto 
 I'll be up in the club, drunk, poppin' bottles 
 I'mma live it up like it ain't no tomorrow 
 Big time, big time, big time, big time 
 But I got to get it my way, I know it ain't pretty 
 Well, I'll be doing my thang till them boys come and get me 
 I'll be doing my thang till I run my whole city 
 Big time, big time, big time, big time 
 I get to it, I hustle, I get it in, trying to win like Steve Wynn 
 Money long like Jay Leno chin, I didn't put nothing in my government 
 I paid my bills in money orders when I was in the trap hella heavy 
 When I used to quarterback that yolla 
 Perm down to my shoulders trying to get it while it's good 
 Till the po po's headquarters up a hub station in our hood 
 A lot of these rappers don't even sound like they believable 
 But you can ask your daddy and uncle about E-feazible 
 They'll say he the gospel, he a for real fisher 
 He used to cop from me, now I cop from that nigga 
 Had to share the same bath water with my brother 
 Used to argue, fuss and fight over pillows and covers 
 The low man at the bottom of the totem pole 
 Used to go the Salvation Army for school clothes 
 Now I'm a whaler, tycoon bro, everyday is Christmas 
 Record company, real estate, food and beverage dealers 
 If I got rich one day, I won the lotto 
 I'll be up in the club, drunk, poppin' bottles 
 I'mma live it up like it ain't no tomorrow 
 Big time, big time, big time, big time 
 But I got to get it my way, I know it ain't pretty 
 Well, I'll be doing my thang till them boys come and get me 
 I'll be doing my thang till I run my whole city 
 Big time, big time, big time, big time 
 Pimpin' is ugly out here, it's gross 
 Best friend will try to sneak if you let him get too close 
 The body will fall if you kill the head 
 What else? 
 Lovers turn quick, they forget who buttered their bread 
 What was you tellin' them? 
 I was just tellin' one my dudes 
 They threw the old rules out the window 
 Created they own new set of rules 
 When the shit in the air 
 Be a man, you can't be scared 
 But you can't be 
 Try to nip it at the bud before it get too outta hand 
 Before what? 
 I got some real ones in the pen 
 That I visit 'cause they my folks 
 Up in there programming 
 What they making? 
 Making diamonds outta soap 
 Just got my car up out the shop 
 What you got in it? 
 Retarded knock 
 Use the loot that I won at a crap game 
 And painted it butterscotch 
 You can hear me throbbing up the block from miles away 
 My neighbor loose it 
 Po-po's pull me over at least 3 times a day for my music 
 My over head $60,000 a month total 
 What else? 
 Conducting business on my sidekick T-mobile 
 If I got rich one day, I won the lotto 
 I'll be up in the club, drunk, poppin' bottles 
 I'mma live it up like it ain't no tomorrow 
 Big time, big time, big time, big time 
 But I got to get it my way, I know it ain't pretty 
 Well, I'll be doing my thang till them boys come and get me 
 I'll be doing my thang till I run my whole city 
 Big time, big time, big time, big time 
 Niggas on the money on a first name basis 
 And I ain't ate all day, I want my birthday cake 
 So if it ain't about the money, you can get it out my face 
 If it ain't about money you can walk the other way 
 'Cause I always been about my dough 
 When they see you doing good, they want to catch you slipping 
 'Cause them boys going to look out you know 
 That ain't gone ever stop me, now don't you worry about me 
 If I got rich one day, I won the lotto 
 I'll be up in the club, drunk, poppin' bottles 
 I'mma live it up like it ain't no tomorrow 
 Big time, big time, big time, big time 
 But I got to get it my way, I know it ain't pretty 
 Well, I'll be doing my thang till them boys come and get me 
 I'll be doing my thang till I run my whole city 
 Big time, big time, big time, big time
