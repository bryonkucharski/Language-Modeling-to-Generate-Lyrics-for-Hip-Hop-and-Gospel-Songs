Hustle, my name 
 I, I live and sleep on these streets 
 'Cause I have got to get mine, my fam, see, we gotta eat 
 So when people ask me why, why don't ever I slow down? 
 Oh, I just simply reply, I don't really know how 
 So I, hustle, hustle, hustle 
 (I'ma hustler, believe me) 
 You know I hustle, hustle, hustle 
 (And this ain't easy) 
 So I hustle, hustle, hustle 
 (I'ma hustler, believe me) 
 You know I hustle, hustle, hustle 
 (And this ain't easy) 
 Money and muscle 
 I gotta black belt in hustling 
 I'm doing my thang 
 Chain around my neck look like a playground swing 
 Unit mover, pockets fat like Raspushia 
 Ask your chick, I got oil on my tongue 
 Pimp, I talk real slick, where the real ones go 
 They don't make them like me no more 
 Hustler, I'ma whole 'nother animal 
 I'ma whole 'nother animal, I'ma whole 'nother beast 
 I can never switch up, I come from the streets 
 Papered up like a fax 
 I'm rare like white running backs 
 I'm getting my Gouda 
 I'ma be the first hustler that set up shop on Jupiter 
 I, I live and sleep on these streets 
 'Cause I have got to get mine, my fam, see we gotta eat 
 So when people ask me why, why don't ever I slow down? 
 Oh, I just simply reply, I don't really know how 
 So I, hustle, hustle, hustle 
 (I'ma hustler, believe me) 
 You know I hustle, hustle, hustle 
 (And this ain't easy) 
 So I hustle, hustle, hustle 
 (I'ma hustler, believe me) 
 You know I hustle, hustle, hustle 
 (And this ain't easy) 
 Let me introduce myself, homeboy 
 Any MC I will destroy 
 West, West, West Coast boy 
 Speakers in the trunk keep making noise 
 I'm so fly, I'm that guy 
 28 inches sitting high 
 I'm a star, what you thought? 
 Everywhere I go they snap shots 
 Everywhere I go they know turf 
 Medallions jiggling off my shirt 
 See no skeep falling off my jeans 
 Benjamin Frank, George Washington 
 Gotta keep pushing, pushing weight 
 Fillet mignon steak on my plate 
 Staring in my rear view can't slow down 
 If getting money is wrong, arrest me now 
 I, I live and sleep on these streets 
 'Cause I have got to get mine, my fam, see we gotta eat 
 So when people ask me why, why don't ever I slow down? 
 Oh, I just simply reply, I don't really know how 
 So I, hustle, hustle, hustle 
 (I'ma hustler, believe me) 
 You know I hustle, hustle, hustle 
 (And this ain't easy) 
 So I hustle, hustle, hustle 
 (I'ma hustler, believe me) 
 You know I hustle, hustle, hustle 
 (And this ain't easy) 
 They ask me what you're doing bro 
 I say that I hustle everyday 
 My men don't sleep, we always up 
 'Cause we can't live off minimum wage 
 Middle finger right to the other side 
 I know that I just want to get paid 
 When you hear this one go ahead and turn it up 
 From Virgin Islands out to the bay 
 I, I live and sleep on these streets 
 'Cause I have got to get mine, my fam, see we gotta eat 
 So when people ask me why, why don't ever I slow down? 
 Oh, I just simply reply, I don't really know how 
 So I, hustle, hustle, hustle 
 (I'ma hustler, believe me) 
 You know I hustle, hustle, hustle 
 (And this ain't easy) 
 So I hustle, hustle, hustle 
 (I'ma hustler, believe me) 
 You know I hustle, hustle, hustle 
 (And this ain't easy)
