Hustling till I die, drink the bar dry 
 There go that man again, right back in the public eye 
 Drunk like Mel Gibson, get high, got a ton of DUI's 
 Cognac sipping, XO, me and my guys 
 Born in colossal, living our lives 
 Trying to get this bobble head bobbin' so she can follow me to my ride 
 So I can make a dentist to convince her to open wide 
 Kick her out when I'm finished, take my baller ass back inside 
 Drug terminology, corner talk that's all I know 
 California mentality, ask about me pimp I go 
 You can check my track record, I don't like to feud 
 But if I must I'll have your head severed 
 Blacks live in traps, zones and projects 
 Corner boy greeting crack in the apartment complex 
 World wide outside of the Bay they give me my stacks 
 Do business with head execs and corporate execs 
 He ain't going nowhere, the boy too nice 
 He done it again and got rich twice 
 Keep a thump on top 
 We ain't broke, we papered up 
 He ain't going nowhere, the boy too nice 
 He done it again and got rich twice 
 Keep a thump on top 
 We ain't broke, we papered up 
 Cut him off like an umbilical cord, turn off his lights 
 We need to silence that brother, his voice too strong on the mike 
 I make it look easy but it's not, I'm just doing Feazy 
 Why should I stop now, pimp, The Game need me? 
 Be a real one, pimp, go get it and do what he used to 
 Trying to get this music scrapping, move it, push it and groove it 
 Louis luggage, rugging and rushing my intellect 
 Got suckas hollering and screaming my hood set 
 Designer socks on my Chevy box shaking the car 
 You need my alpha minute, too heavy I can't stop 
 Gaming plot, all my dudes on the grave clock 
 Hope I die and rock on my funeral on my block 
 The streets they don't play fair 
 The mayor, he really don't care 
 Momma worked 3 jobs, trying to keep a roof on hour heads 
 Bologna sandwiches, pulled the mold off the bread 
 He ain't going nowhere, the boy too nice 
 He done it again and got rich twice 
 Keep a thump on top 
 We ain't broke, we papered up 
 He ain't going nowhere, the boy too nice 
 He done it again and got rich twice 
 Keep a thump on top 
 We ain't broke, we papered up 
 Gotta a lil' thump, we got what you need 
 If you want it, got to copy it from me 
 We are sure you too could see that it's real 
 Everywhere we go we burn down the hills 
 Automatics and semi's, high performance and hemi's 
 In the thick of the soil, we think Buick's is Bentley's 
 Coffee pots boil, burn, fly, simmer and stew 
 I'm off of this oil y'all, I hope you is too 
 Out of the Beverly camp you need a crew 
 Showing our underwear, exactly that's what we do 
 Turf dropping and stacking and money making 
 Surfing, earthquake slapping and trunk rattling 
 He ain't going nowhere, the boy too nice 
 He done it again and got rich twice 
 Keep a thump on top 
 We ain't broke, we papered up 
 He ain't going nowhere, the boy too nice 
 He done it again and got rich twice 
 Keep a thump on top 
 We ain't broke, we papered up 
 Gotta a lil' thump, we got what you need 
 If you want it, got to cop it from me 
 We are sure you too can see that it's real 
 Everywhere we go we burn down the hills 
 Got rich twice, damn, got rich twice, damn 
 Got rich twice, damn, got rich twice, damn 
 Nigga, I'd done it again, damn 
 Nigga, I'd done it again, damn 
 Nigga, I'd done it again, damn 
 Nigga, I'd done it again, damn
