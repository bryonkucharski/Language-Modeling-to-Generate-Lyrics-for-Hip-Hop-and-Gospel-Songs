(Feat. Raw Smoov) 
 I bet you ain't never seen 26's on a range 
 Iced out VVS stones and a chain 
 She Want a Hood boy [x4] 
 I bet you ain't never seen a nigga pushin' that work 
 Gettin' it, how he live stuntin' on the turf 
 (Verse 1: E-40) 
 She Want a Hood boy 
 She want a hood boy 
 She don't want no mark 
 Body art on his arm's and neck and across his heart 
 They throwin' up the block 
 I represent my part 
 It's a zoo I got more animals then Noah's ark 
 I keep the bottles cracked 
 I got the dro sparked 
 44 cocked 
 S65 parked 
 I'm a hood boy 
 I be ridin' wet 
 Insides jelly 
 Touchscreen deck 
 They say you go boy 
 I love yo' swag and 'staljha' 
 I remember fo' you rap you used to sell that yowder 
 Breitling for Bentley watch 
 26 inch socks 
 Pick a ride girl 
 I got a car lot 
 I bet you ain't never seen 26's on a range 
 Iced out VVS stones and a chain 
 She Want a Hood boy [x4] 
 I bet you ain't never seen a nigga pushin' that work 
 Gettin' it, how he live stuntin' on the turf 
 She Want a Hood boy [x4] 
 (Verse 2: E-40) 
 I got paper 
 But I be on the under 
 Every 3 or 4 weeks I change my phone number 
 Pope's be trying to watch me 
 On some old shit 
 I give em' the same line 
 I don't know shit 
 I don't want a model 
 I want some stretch marks 
 30 pound butt meat cheeks pull apart 
 Damn I be coonin' 
 Japanese jeans on 
 Shorty on my line 
 She got me on her ringtone 
 She love me 
 I like her 
 I'm too hood 
 To wife her 
 I'm to hood to wife her 
 Plus I got 3 just like her 
 I'm on this XO Landy 
 Mixed with 40 water 
 I bet you ain't never seen 26's on a range 
 Iced out VVS stones and a chain 
 She Want a Hood boy [x4] 
 I bet you ain't never seen a nigga pushin' that work 
 Gettin' it, how he live stuntin' on the turf 
 She Want a Hood boy [x4] 
 I can tell when she lookin' at me 
 I can tell she wan't a nigga from the streets 
 She wan't that hood boy [x4] 
 I can tell when she lookin' at me 
 I can tell she wan't a nigga like 40 
 She wan't that hood boy [x4] 
 I bet you ain't never seen 26's on a range 
 Iced out VVS stones and a chain 
 She Want a Hood boy [x4] 
 I bet you ain't never seen a nigga pushin' that work 
 Gettin' it, how he live stuntin' on the turf 
 She Want a Hood boy [x4]
