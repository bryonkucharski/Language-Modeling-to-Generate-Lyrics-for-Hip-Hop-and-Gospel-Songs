Righteous people be knowin' what I be doin' is protect my peoples 
 Million dollar spot 
 Uh, that's right, uh, my million dollar spot 
 My million dollar spot (beyatch) my million dollar spot 
 My million dollar spot, on the block bring it hot (beyatch) 
 On the spot, my million dollar spot, uh 
 Verse One: E-40 
 Major loot, seriously niggaz don't wanna dispute 
 Mysteriously a nigga die, when you play this game and ain't know the time 
 I suck the life out your ass by pushin mute 
 Shit can get stanky like a poot (like a poot) 
 I got dog poop crank yes I pollute 
 Leave the whole block fully unrecouped 
 I'm like a record company, givin' out advancements 
 Get my money back, by any circumstances 
 My million dollar spot, not to mention 
 Drive through service, Church's chicken 
 A bu-a-bucket full of acid by the do' 
 Just in case I gotta throw away my yole 
 Bars around the house, bars around the window 
 Dope around the corner, broken down Pinto 
 You can tell who got the mail who got the biggest chops 
 My million dollar spot... beyatch! 
 Chorus: 2Pac (with singing in background) 
 I can take a chance, I could live in cans 
 Bring it on the block, my million dollar spot 
 Haha, my million dollar spot bigger 
 I can take a chance, I could live in cans 
 Get my motherfuckin cash on 
 You know how we do it out here in California, beatch! 
 Bring it on the block, my million dollar spot 
 Verse Two: 2Pac 
 It was, more than just a dream for me 
 To be the King it seems I need a killer team to get the green for me 
 Hit the scene clean in my Chevy, now I'm ready for trouble 
 Count my rocks, set up shop, collect my fetti and bubble 
 Faded visions of me as a timer 
 Though marijuana clouds my vision I'm still watch for drama, ha-ha 
 They got me crossed tryin' to be the boss, no one can stop us 
 Niggaz dream of six figures, handle our business in choppers 
 Feds can't comprehend my ghetto slang, so I evade 
 And plot and plan a life of better thangs, all about my chedder main 
 Help me if I fall, can I ball for life 
 A half a key in my drawers, bein cautious like 
 I wanna rise keep my eyes open 
 Witness motherfuckers die with they eyes open, my niggaz rise smokin' 
 Any busta bitch tryin' to stop my wish 
 To have a million dollar spot gettin' riches, nigga 
 Chorus: 2Pac (singing in background) 
 I can take a chance, I could live in cans 
 In my million dollar spot 
 Bring it on the block, million dollar spot 
 Get your money nigga! Fuck the cops, in my million dollar spot 
 I can take a chance, I could live in cans 
 We got rocks, coke and hops, in my million dollar spot 
 Gimme all your motherfuckin money all money good money 
 Bring it on the block, million dollar spot 
 Hear me, get money nigga! 
 Verse Three: B-Legit 
 Nuttin but the motherfuckin hog in me 
 Hit the Hillside trapped with thirty-six O-Z's 
 Serve nothin' but doves, no twat no love 
 Now nigga don't make me get these burner gloves 
 I got the whole block jumpin' like the Mardi Gras 
 Nothin' but a dope fiend party y'all 
 I'm lovin' this game, it's my favorite sport 
 Come short get burnt with the Newport 
 I'm in the four-oh, and 'Pac came to see me 
 Smobbin in a nine-six drop rose Bentley, shit be 
 Caution for these niggaz on the ocean 
 A sip of the potion now your nigga be in motion 
 Bossin hopin fede-ral thieves don't raid 
 Catch me with a glock and a box of grenades 
 I'm tryin' to get paid, all about my lucci 
 Now bitch put this motherfuckin key in your coochie 
 Outro: E-40 
 Motherfuckers hoe hard! 
 Ya understand that? Motherfuckers hoe hard! 
 We got shit jumpin' off on every spot 
 We got crank methamphetamines 
 Dope for ass to get yo' cash, motherfucker 
 We got big pimpin', ya understand 
 We got solicitin, ya know 
 We got all kind of shit, prostitution 
 It don't stop 
 Motherfucker tryin' to just get his cash on the motherfuckin 
 Million dollar spot, BEYATCH! 
 I can take a chance, I could live in cans 
 That's right, my million dollar spot 
 Bring it on the block, my million dollar spot 
 Uh, for ya knot, my million dollar spot 
 I can take a chance, I could live in cans 
 My million dollar spot, my million dollar spot 
 Bring it on the block, my million dollar spot 
 Righteous people know what I be doin' be protectin my peoples 
 Million dollar spot, my million dollar spot BEYATCH!
