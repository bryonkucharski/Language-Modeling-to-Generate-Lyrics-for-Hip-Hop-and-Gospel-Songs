There she go sliding down the pole 
 There she go sliding down the pole 
 There she is, there she is, there she go, there she go 
 There she is, there she is, there she go, there she go 
 There she go sliding down the pole 
 There she go sliding down the pole 
 There she is, yeah, there she go 
 There she is, yeah, there she go 
 They say her brain is in her ass but she really smart 
 All about her cash never been a mark 
 Raised in the trap seen a whole lot 
 Glutinous maximums shape like a heart 
 Legs spread apart, trying to go to Clark 
 Looking for the light but always find dark 
 Some of my folks like trickin', some of my folks like pimpin' 
 Some of my folks spit rap, some of my folks pitch crack 
 Give you a tycoon shower without the shower cap 
 I got the money and the power sprinkle you a stack 
 There she go sliding down the pole 
 One dollar bills coming out her asshole 
 There she go sliding down the pole 
 There she go sliding down the pole 
 There she is, there she is, there she go, there she go 
 There she is, there she is, there she go, there she go 
 There she go sliding down the pole

 There she is, yeah, there she go 
 There she is, yeah, there she go 
 There she go down the pole 
 That's daddy's little girl but he don't know 
 If he finds out she'll be in trouble 
 But if he don't her money doubles 
 Everyday she goes to work 
 Put her on stage they go berserk 
 I'm way in the back blowing purp 
 You throwing cash in the air, you suppose to flirt 
 She come out dem draws ass everywhere 
 Don't keep her all night, pass her player 
 'Cause she's my favorite, yes, she is 
 I wanna see her dance naked, she the best in the biz 
 Bitch 
 There she go sliding down the pole 
 There she go sliding down the pole 
 There she is, there she is, there she go, there she go 
 There she is, there she is, there she go, there she go 
 There she go sliding down the pole

 There she is, yeah, there she go 
 There she is, yeah, there she go 
 Bigger than all outdoors, she got booty galore 
 Ass like I've never even seen before 
 She cakey, she pickin' up her money off the floor 
 It's crazy all the ballers in the club know 
 I called the crib told my broad, I ain't coming back home 
 I then found me another chick I wanna bone 
 They call me short, I'm nothing nice 
 Been hangin' out in clubs all my life 
 Seen a wild ass stripper, hair was bushy 
 Upside down with a bear in her pussy 
 Lay up on the pole she can sit on a roof 
 Slid back down she was getting it loose 
 There she go sliding down the pole 
 There she go sliding down the pole 
 There she is, there she is, there she go, there she go 
 There she is, there she is, there she go, there she go 
 There she go sliding down the pole

 There she is, yeah, there she go 
 There she is, yeah, there she go
