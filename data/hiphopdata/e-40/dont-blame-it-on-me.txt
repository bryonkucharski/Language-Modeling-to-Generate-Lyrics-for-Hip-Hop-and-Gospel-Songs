(Feat. B-Legit) 
 [E-40] Youse a fool. You sound like you fin to earl 
 They can have all the armor but that calm doesn't harm 
 Chorus One: E-40 
 Double cross the game, and get yo' head to' off 
 Disrespect the game, ya get yo' head to' off 
 Your faulty bitches main? A getcha head to' off 
 Fuck with my riches main? And getcha head to' off, beittch! 
 (B-Legit) 
 I'm erog-enous, most dog in this 
 Dark brown like a clot, but now I'm saucy 
 Hoes toss me they number like an alley-oop 
 But I slam it in the trash, if she ain't got, ass and loot 
 Shoot, it's all mine in the nine sizzle 
 Pistol still fizeal fine, direct hits make 'em retire 
 I ain't no liar, I put it on my flow 
 Niggaz fuck around, they get they head to' off 
 (E-40) 
 What's up? They disrespect us 
 Them fools ain't tryin' to fight no wars 
 You talkin' about bang bang 
 That's the way this shit gonna go 
 Just let your balls hang 
 Don't think about just do it 
 'Cause when you think about it 
 Before you know it, you blew it 
 I ain't got shit to lose 
 No mercy nigga, no sarges 
 Get your rowdy boys 
 Do it today not tomorrow 
 Check your inventory 
 Make sure you got enough ammo 
 It's self-explanitory 
 Don't let 'em blow out the candle, biotch! 
 Chorus Two: E-40 
 Think about it 'fore you pop that shit 
 'Cause if they find you witcha crew, they pack split 
 Don't blame it on me (4X) 
 (Repeat all 2X) 
 (E-40) 
 You came up sixteen 
 Interest is fast 
 She'll still serve everybody 
 For the cash 
 She likes to party 
 With her ass-lick pussy-lick 
 Dick 
 Lick ass 
 (B-Legit) 
 And we some grown men, we turn trill hoe out 
 And all we ever did was stuck dick in her mouth 
 We fuck wines to the millionaires 
 Ball players that play, you better keep your bitch out the Bay 
 (E-40) 
 The less fortunate 
 The sluts, the drug abusers 
 Oldest profession known to mankind 
 Is prostitution 
 When I make a zillion I resign 
 Just like clockwork 
 But you know me I'm always a day or two late 
 And a dollar short 
 (B-Legit) 
 I trick a bitch that love Legit and do whatever I tell her to 
 From credit card scams to givin' head to you 
 So if you breathe, know what I mean, prepare that ass 
 For the guillotine boss, get that ass to' off 
 Chorus One 
 Chorus Two 
 (B-Legit) 
 I got dreams of a mansion with the glass block 
 About a million point five in the stash box 
 I let the beat knock, I let the ass drop 
 And if a nigga run up, he get ch-uh-chopped 
 (E-40) 
 Case number two forty six, she been in an unhappy dwellin 
 Neighbors steady complainin, 'bout the dope sellin 
 But they ain't never been evicted, or convicted 
 They ain't never been subpeonaed to court, or arrested 
 (B-Legit) 
 I tried to tell 'em like I once told fools what's up 
 Fonzarelli and the Savage get they cash and loss 
 I'm from the coast, where we don't play that kid shit 
 And niggaz get they motherfuckin wig split 
 (E-40) 
 Ah I spits nothin' less than hi-tech Lugz 
 We can buck on each other or we can put on the gloves 
 Don't make me mad let me know, if you want more spot 
 I can do this playa, get the driveshaft all off, biotch!
