Here's a little story I got to tell 
 And this dis goes on, again and again 
 Uh, Uh 
 Here's a little story I got to tell

 Uh, Uh 
 Here's a little story I got to tell 
 And this dis goes on, again and again 
 Uh, Uh 
 Here's a little story I got to tell 
 And this dis goes on, again and again 
 Uh, Uh 
 I think it goes, ya live by the dirt, ya die by the shovel 
 You can repent and come with god or you can know a devil 
 You can go and get a job or you can do some federal 
 But if I were you, I'd straighten up and do some next level 
 I often tweek when I drive (drives) 
 How can a small town like Vallejo have all these homicides? 
 Man, fools be droppin' like flies 
 Maybe we do need mo brothers sellin' bean pies 
 And it's a fool 'cause everybody mama's know each other 
 It ain't cool, but you know black folks like to act they color 
 Wonder why all the good people get put through some many 
 Different changes of the weather 
 And all those folks that do wrong seem like they 
 Live forever 
 I wish I can rewind time 
 Remember when we used to get free lunch, and the 
 City bus used to cost a dime? 
 Runnin' around, talkin' about you got the cooties 
 Liftin up skirts, and touchin girl's booties 
 Boy, take those shoes off before ya come up in dis house 
 And whatever you do, don't you sit on grandmama's plastic 
 Covered couch 
 Why is it that when all the homeys get togethor, we get back 
 In the dayz 
 And how come every time we get drunk somebody bring up AIDS 
 Life is something you can't borrow and give back 
 Here today and gone tomorrow 
 Just like that 
 Pat yo rats on yo back (Patch your rats on your back) 
 Take some time out yo waltz (Take some time out yo waltz) 
 And tell your loved ones that you love 'em every so often 
 Uh, Uh fetti is the key to end all your woes 
 Contemporary crib, cash, cars and clothes 
 But fetti cause problems like guns and spears 
 Familys fall out and don't talk for years 
 Like my cromey (Like my cromey) 
 They called him big bread Ed 
 His first cousin set him up and left his ass for dead 
 Churches, wakes, nothing unusual, seem like every other 
 Damn day I'm buyin a brand new suit for a funeral 
 Have yo pockets ever lost weight, and you ain't even tried 
 Did you wonder if yo cash was on a diet 
 See, when you're up, everybody wanna come around 
 But when ya down, ain't nobody out there to be found 
 If you love someone you should tell 'em often 
 Ya never know when they'll be layin in a coffin 
 Dedicated to my peoples up in jail 
 Ya partner 40-wada gotta story to tell (a story to tell) 
 You can take da ninja out da getto (the getto) 
 But not the getto out da ninja, give me life for 3 rocks 
 But I won't surrender 
 Oh he's a heathen (heathen), look at the way he dress 
 He must be dealin' (dealin') how did he get that Lex 
 Of course, if it ain't used get spokes, it's crime and coast 
 It's all dey work 
 Shootin shit up and actin' tough, ridin' around with gold 'n' stuff 
 It's rough 
 How much money you earn, enough, I own my own law firm 
 Don't need a tux, I twerks peacoats and kakis (kakis) 
 Levis and t-shirts (Levis and t-shirts), whatever the street's works 
 (Street's works) 
 Partner - dude, you been actin' kinda funny lately since you even 
 Got a few bucks 
 But I'm still folks, Wilson Park, 'member three flies up 
 And this goes on, again and again 
 Dis goes on, again and again 
 Ain't nothin' changed but the terror-tory (territory) 
 Same time, different day, different story
