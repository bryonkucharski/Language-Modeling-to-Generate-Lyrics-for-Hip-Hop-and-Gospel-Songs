(Feat. Lil' Mo) 
 Hoo... 
 Yeah... (Woo) 
 Ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... 
 Yeah, yeah... 
 I just wanna be your super woman 
 Wanna keep you goin', wanna make you smile 
 I'm the one that's gon' be faithful to you 
 And without you, come on, let me show you how 
 Baby, don't you know you drive me crazy 
 'Bout to have your baby 'cause I love your style 
 Boy, I never wanna let you go 
 Gotta let you know, we could start right now 
 Through thick and thin to the end 
 If I ran out of money, no dividends 
 If I had to do time, if I was up in the pen 
 Would you still be my lady, would you still be my friend 
 No matter how tough it get, no matter whatever matter 
 Are you gon' still have my back like a chiropractor 
 Through sickness, through health, for or better, for worse 
 Till the day that they haul me off in a hearse 
 Our world is as big as we make it 
 Let's make the best of it, darlin', let's celebrate it 
 We too real to be phony, why should we fake it 
 We too dumb to be lonely, let's elevate it 
 We could reach for the stars, the outer limits 
 Would you share with me if you had the winnin' lottery ticket 
 I need the kinda broad that they don't make 
 The kind that know how to cook and communicate 
 I just wanna be your super woman 
 Wanna keep you goin', wanna make you smile 
 I'm the one that's gon' be faithful to you 
 And without you, come on, let me show you how 
 Baby, don't you know you drive me crazy 
 'Bout to have your baby 'cause I love your style 
 Boy, I never wanna let you go 
 Gotta let you know, we could start right now 
 I'm not a rescue Roni, I'm a Mack-aroni 
 My Mack game is impeccable, no boloney 
 But you done lifted on a player so tough 
 So that you never player wanna put his pimped up ride 
 I'll be hard-headed, super thug 
 You want me at home, but I'll be at the club 
 Gettin' whiskyed, then perked and gettin' tipped 
 Whatever club is wherever I be gettin' killed 
 I'm a managed person, super perkin' 
 This is how I eat, mama, see I be networkin' 
 I stay in the traffic, I'm all about my Gs 
 Put your clothes on, darlin', let's go to Tommy T's 
 The comedy club up in the Contra Costa 
 Offa Willow Pass Road up in Concord 
 I ain't a pretty boy and I ain't ugly 
 If a broad got in my face would you scratch her up off me, uh 
 I just wanna be your super woman 
 Wanna keep you goin', wanna make you smile 
 I'm the one that's gon' be faithful to you 
 And without you, come on, let me show you how 
 Baby, don't you know you drive me crazy 
 'Bout to have your baby 'cause I love your style 
 Boy, I never wanna let you go 
 Gotta let you know, we could start right now 
 No, I ain't ever gonna let you go, no, no 
 Never, never gonna let you go, no 
 I ain't ever gonna let you go 
 Gotta let you know, we could start right now 
 You remind me of my favorite instrument, a guitar 
 Or my favorite vehicle, a Chevy SSR 
 I'm a cursed superstar 
 We go together like a drink at the bar 
 Like Tiger Woods in the back of 9 par, trust that 
 I know you the type to stand tall through it all 
 Let's splurge a little, let's me and you hit the mall 
 I'll get you the Stella McCartney jeans and boots 
 You get the Steve Harvey line collection suit 
 We could juggle some bills to use our skills 
 We could sell a few pills to make a few deals 
 However, whatever to get the scrill 
 Whatever it takes for us to get over the hill 
 I just wanna be your super woman 
 Wanna keep you goin', wanna make you smile 
 I'm the one that's gon' be faithful to you 
 And without you, come on, let me show you how 
 Baby, don't you know you drive me crazy 
 'Bout to have your baby 'cause I love your style 
 Boy, I never wanna let you go 
 Gotta let you know, we could start right now 
 We could start right now, uh 
 We ain't gotta wait till tomorrow 
 Not another second, not another minute, hey, no 
 We could start right now, yeah 
 Right-right now 
 Right-right-right now, ooh
