"40-H2O, I got a few ends, can we do some kind of business mate?" 
 It depends on how much you wanna spend 
 And how much profit I'm gon' make 
 What's the crazy? Sellin half a kezy, right now they go for eight 
 But you know we in the middle of a drought playboy, 
 So tomorrow might be too late 
 Prices keep on elevatin, 
 Escalatin and fluctuatin like Oprah Winfrey's weight 
 Hesitatin, eliminatin competitor's competition out the gate 
 Peruvian flake, cotton candy yams and Highway 5 
 About an estimated four-and-a-half hour drive, LET ME GO 
 Na na, can't do that, too dangerous, too young 
 Back off, it's a commotion, might even swallow your tongue 
 HOW?!? I'll tell ya later, hop your ass in this Kezy 
 Where we headed? Venice Beach 
 Gotta go pick up our greasy ex-po po martial arts expert 
 Money on grip and desperate, nuttin to be reckoned with 
 I tell you motherfuckers she's a fool 
 Damn she sound like a fuckin' nut 
 Let's bust her potna and get the fuck 
 We smoke trees and slang ki's, off the fuckin' E's 
 Livin' life as a criminal doin' a bunch of dirty deeds 
 (Look here) 
 We smoke trees and slang ki's, off the fuckin' E's 
 Livin' life as a criminal doin' a bunch of dirty deeds 
 (Whatcha do?) 
 Doin' a bunch of dirty deeds 
 It ain't gon' be no cakewalk, so whatever ya do don't talk 
 Others been sufficed to triangular markers with numbers on em 
 And bodies outlined in chalk 
 Bodies outlined in chalk, triangular markers with numbers on em 
 And bodies outlined in chalk 
 Call them organs, call my lawyer while you're at it 
 Tell my gal get that dope up out the attic 
 We ism, I caught the po-po tryin' ta spoil it 
 Too much narcotics to be flushin down the toilet 
 These bitches talkin' bout some shit I never knew about 
 Some shit I never heard, some shit that I could sue about 
 Knew I was in Pittsburgh promotin a charity concert wit my weep 
 And luckily a motherfucker like me 
 Had enough common sense to keep the receipt 
 35th and room service 
 Buffalo wings and Bleu cheese dressing, Caesar salad 
 A glass of wine and lots of sexin, don't you doubt it 
 25 percent bookworm, 150 percent street smart 
 Makin' business, accusations only reach a start 
 We smoke trees and slang ki's, off the fuckin' E's 
 Livin' life as a criminal doin' a bunch of dirty deeds 
 (Watcha do?) 
 We smoke trees and slang ki's, off the fuckin' E's 
 Livin' life as a criminal doin' a bunch of dirty deeds 
 (Uh) 
 Doin' a bunch of dirty deeds 
 As soon as I could walk I'd cooked up bout half a meal ticket 
 At the age of 17 years old fuckin' 'em up like that 
 Ovulatin in the kettle loft 'cause I kept watchin the game 
 I'd fall in the yard 
 Operation Desperation, go get your fetti, 
 Daddy slingin niggas who off 
 In front of the liquor store tryin' to get somebody 
 To buy me a bottle and a pack of Newports 
 So that a motherfucker can up-chuck on the teacher 
 When I get to school, restricted 
 So move up out of the classroom, better yet after school to diss this 
 Hella quick tip, wit extra manners, tie your ass up wit the phone cord 
 Duct tape your mouth, talk to your ass in Spanish 
 Describe me voice, like me no speak no English 
 Take me razorblade and get to choppin at your fingers 
 Straight killers new to my squadron 
 My deuce don't even know that's on my squadron's back 
 Godzilla ballers, a juvenile with damn man respect 
 Craze up off the set, pistol whippin negroes wit my Tek 
 Nina millimetre heater, heavy metal wet 
 Crushin heads and snappin necks, causin nosebleeds 
 A 150 percent street nigga about dem dirty deeds 
 We smoke trees and slang ki's, off the fuckin' E's 
 Livin' life as a criminal doin' a bunch of dirty deeds 
 (Whatcha do?) 
 We smoke trees and slang ki's, off the fuckin' E's 
 Livin' life as a criminal doin' a bunch of dirty deeds 
 (Whatcha do?)
