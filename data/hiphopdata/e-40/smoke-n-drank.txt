(Spit that shit) 
 Durrin a playa like my youth 
 I think I recall when I got my first tooth 
 I was a teeny little ol teether lil old peeverl ittle bitches 
 Some like a little further on down the line 
 Started fuckin' with moonshine, all kind of wines 
 Stood in front of the liquor house sokin up kidney, from old timers 
 Buy me a drank man I know it's against the law be a good sport liquor sport 
 What you need my little comrad a packet of kool-aid and some throw up 
 What else? A pack of Bb's and a short naked Night Train 
 Whatchu gonna give me? A couple of foodstamps that I won in a dice game 
 Preciate it playa, I'm up out of this bitch bout to go hook up 
 With my side hill now them shits relatives simple ones kinfolks 
 Good folks, y'know, y'know 
 Twisted, slogan, me and my fools be out there back pervin 
 Tor' back on your face and started to roll over 
 Let's perv, throw up, and drank again 
 Let's get high, loaded, and smoke again 
 Just wakin' up from my hang-over 
 Still high, like I swallowed an ounce of 
 Yola"coke" I don't wanna ever be sober 
 Like payin' tuishin, wake up in the same position, open up the safe 
 Peep the stash, lookin' mighty healthy, plenty of cash 
 Grabbed my faulty"cell phone" from up out the charger 
 And then boutsta make a dash called up the folks today is the day 
 For my nigga's birthday twelve o'clock come through gon get beat 
 By who? By them hog mark niggaz in the cleats 
 We's deep, no remorse no feelings retardos no sorrow 
 Drink it till your motherfuckin insides turn holow to cross and wallow 
 Back to back, struck and strikin, that's your job (that's your job nigga) 
 To make you lift this tick, fuckit nigga blow a bottle 
 Room spinnin, dead 
 Got the garbage can next to the bed 
 Now I was tweakin off that old crazy ass commercial on BET Jackie Stallone 
 What made it so bad is I don't even know how I got home 
 Niggaz ain't feel me y'know fuck this sergeant general 
 When they peoples be lookin' like that indo 
 Viktaa barren, purple kushdo 
 Smob with me I'm tryin' to told ya like you get to perkin 
 Ride to me I'll teach you some of this game that I be twerkin' 
 Pull this motherfucker over main, you probably gotta go piss again 
 Don't even sweat it though just be on the lookout for so-and-so 
 Now whatchu be callin them po-po's? Tedelknows 
 Penelopes, grill up out of this bitch man 
 I got warrants, let's go get some Hen main
