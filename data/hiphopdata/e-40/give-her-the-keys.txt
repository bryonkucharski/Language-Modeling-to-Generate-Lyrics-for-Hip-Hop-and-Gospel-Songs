(Feat. T-Pain) 
 Yeah (Eh!) 
 Yeah (Eh!) 
 Ah Huh! 
 Ah Huh! 
 Uuuugggghhh! 
 Yeah Mane! 
 It's Magic! 
 E-40 and my partna T-Pain 
 (Nappy Boy!) 
 Open up that garage 
 It's a big fat car 
 With a big fat bow on top (on top) 
 It's a Bentley Coupe with the roof let back 
 Now shawty you know that's hot 
 I'm a give her the keys 
 (Uuugghh!) Ooh (Uuugghh!) Ooh (Uuugghh!) Ooh 
 (x2) 
 Now shawty sang it to me 
 Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! 
 And I'm a give her the keys 
 Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! 
 E-40: 
 Uuuugggghhh! 
 From a bucket to a Benz 
 A Benz to a Bentley 
 Down with me from the start 
 Got my back like a tank top 
 When I used to be on the block 
 She hid my rocks in her yacht 
 Got a special place in my heart 
 She knows how to play her part 
 Every time I look at you darling 
 I get a hard on 
 You sexy without your make up on 
 I wanna bone 
 Move you out the hood 
 I told you I would 
 I'm not phony 
 We both from the same place 
 Grew up on fried bologna 
 They say the opposites attract 
 But we gotta a lot in common 
 Behind every boss player is a boss woman 
 Imam fiend when it come to our cooking 
 You do your thang 
 Throw down like Paula Dean 
 Neck bones and collard greens 
 E-40: 
 Born in the mud, raised in the trap 
 Down ass broad, never been a sap 
 If I ever need bail, went to jail, got popped 
 You'll be Johnny on the spot 
 You'll come and get me out 
 A loyalist, not just a friend to me 
 We was meant to be 
 We got chemistry 
 You like when I lay this pipe 
 Been around each other so long 
 They say we starting to look a like 
 Starting to think a like 
 Getting our money right 
 Fuss, fight, then make love all night 
 California king on a California queen 
 My California dream 
 We make a good team 
 E-40: 
 It's the little things that count 
 Any means much 
 Can't nothing come between us 
 Can't nothing separate us 
 You're my backbone 
 You my rib 
 You my chick 
 You my backbone 
 You my rib 
 You my chick 
 It's the little things that count 
 Any means much 
 Can't nothing come between us 
 Can't nothing separate us 
 You my backbone 
 You my rib 
 You my chick 
 You my backbone 
 You my rib 
 You my chick 
 Yeah mane! 
 It's a drought on loyal females 
 The good ones is hard to find mane 
 So when you find a good one 
 Hold on to that broad 
 Mane you hear me
