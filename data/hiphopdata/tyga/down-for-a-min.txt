My nigga, I've been down for a minute 
 And I've been tryna make my way home 
 You know I've been down for a minute 
 My way home, my way home 
 You know I've been down for a minute 
 And I've been tryna make my way home 
 You know I've been down for a minute 
 My way home, my way home 
 I've been rollin' with 'em hitters 
 And I done got way, way, way strong 
 And niggas wanna rob me, she wanna rob me 
 But I be on my way home 
 And I be ridin' wit her, I rhyme wit her 
 I take her where homie can't go 
 And I be state to state wit her, stay wit her 
 And niggas actin' like they don't know 
 But baby watchin' all that shit though 
 When you get the fame, that's how things goes 
 And everybody talk that talk though 
 But when the money talks, we can talk more 
 You know I've been down for a minute 
 And I've been tryna make my way home 
 You know I've been down for a minute 
 My way home, my way home 
 I've been down with 'em hitters 
 And I done got way, way, way strong 
 And niggas wanna rob you, she wanna rob you 
 But I be on my way home 
 You know I be on the map and I be on an app 
 I swear to god I'm all of that, I'm on to you 
 And what you want, I ain't comin' back, I ain't comin' back 
 I swear to god I'm ain't comin' back, don't wait for you 
 You know it's all love, heart attack, heart attack 
 I told the money where my heart at, no comin' back 
 And niggas take that money though 
 Niggas take that money though (I know I did) 
 And now I'm formed with no assist 
 Spend the gain with my main bitch 
 Comin' down in that lane switch 
 Stuntin' now on these lame niggas 
 What the fuck ya name is, don't care what ya name is 
 And I be on a same Glock with the same Glock 
 I ain't the same now, I ain't the same now and she know 
 You know I've been down for a minute 
 And I've been tryna make my way home 
 You know I've been down for a minute 
 My way home, my way home 
 I've been rollin' with 'em hitters 
 And I done got way, way, way strong 
 And niggas wanna rob me, she wanna rob me 
 But I be on my way home 
 And I be, goddamn, almost everyday 
 Not a faint on me now when you fade away 
 Tell me, is you down from him, you down from me 
 I don't trust that, I'm over that, I'm done with that 
 I'm like fuck that, I love you and fuck that, I need you 
 I took you 'round the globe and back 
 Matter fact, to Rome and back, I can tell you need that 
 Cause baby, you've been down for a minute 
 And you've been tryna make your way home 
 Baby, you've been down for a minute 
 Your way home, your way home 
 You've been rollin' with 'em hitters 
 And you done got way, way, way strong 
 And now they wanna rob you, she wanna rob me 
 But we be on our way home 
 Whenever you get lost 
 Just remember I will always be there to guide you 
 Listen to the sound of my voice 
 My love will always be your light 
 Darkness will always follow the brightest star 
 Our dreams are what make who we are 
 The world's yours, Tyga
