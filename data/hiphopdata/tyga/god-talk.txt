Stand back, god talk 
 The watch cost 
 First things first I pop, sling all the honeys 
 Ain't it funny? Angel, I got devils wanting money 
 Seems sacred but get nathin' 
 My penetration is all revelations 
 And my eyes only seeing basic, they foul flagrant 
 Infatuated with the bracelets, diamond-cut player 
 You fallacious, not complacent 
 Competition, I'm your favourite, knock knock 
 It's me, motherfucker, you're dead wrong 
 Turning your doorknob, a heartthrob 
 Never my title but you bitches getting robbed 
 I rhyme and flip lines so far ahead of my time 
 My punchlines is lemon lime 
 I'm sour, nigga, sweeter than pine 
 I'm God's gift like Christmas time 
 The money Jewish but it's black on black crimes 
 They box me in from time to time 
 For a Rolex, is you willing to die? You willing to die, nigga? 
 Oh shit, nigga, you a rich nigga? 
 Does your wrist glitter? How much your car engine? 
 I can tell you got six figures 
 Figure you ain't no real nigga 
 You don't struggle like real niggas 
 Probably snitch on a real nigga 
 Just to get you out of bed, nigga 
 Well let's see, my god is your god 
 If he got faith in me, go and pull the trigger 
 And leave it be, nigga 
 Russian roulette, let's make a bet 
 100 on black, I'm back with a vengeance, the villain is vicious 
 Heart of gold is relentless, book of Genesis 
 Don't eat the apple, but you'd rather live ravish 
 Street savvy, but not wealthy 
 Good health, be blessed, tryna reach the heavens 
 One day as I pray, halo over me 
 As I lay back, chick on my lap everyday, this god talk 
 This god talk 
 This god talk 
 Let god talk 
 Stand back lil nigga, let God talk 
 Tryna follow Christ, but this club light super bright 
 And they pay me cash every single night 
 Taking models back to the crib 
 I know you want my life, you don't want my life 
 Couldn't handle what they write about you 
 The Superman of height, you can get 'em high 
 But how far is you willing to climb for your own shine? 
 Blowing shine, papers let a nigga vibe, letting God talk 
 I'm like when summer approach 
 Niggas thinking they're good, but they're more TO 
 I'm known coast to coast, you tryna play god 
 With the devil's robes 
 It's only one god, boy, you far from close 
 Been ready, change cars like winter coats 
 Niggas bubblegum, Winterfresh, in they Easter clothes 
 No lint on my Easter clothes 
 Resurrect, the prophet spoke 
 This god talk 
 This god talk 
 Let god talk 
 God talk 
 And the Lord he told me find my way home 
 And the Lord he told me find my way home 
 And the Lord he told me make me home 
 And the Lord he told me find my way home
