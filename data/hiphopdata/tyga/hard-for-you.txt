You know it's only good pussy that I'm used to 
 Now this good dick only thing you used to 
 Anything less couldn't hear her with a bluetooth 
 Laced up, tongue out, stuntin', actin' brand new 
 They ain't even know you was steppin' in Giuseppe too 
 37 spare bright jeans 'bout 12 jewels 
 Posin' like a mannequin, bag, matching manicure 
 Two ill shawites in the van, she heaven sent 
 Ever since you was little had a silver spoon 
 How they make it hard for you shoulda made a song for you 
 And the world is your stage, turn on the lights for you 
 Lighting up one in the crowd I be rootin' for you 
 If it don't go well, well I'm still rootin' for you 
 Lean on me if you need help, I'm a tutor to you 
 Put me in the cell, hit a nigga when you ready to 
 Better when it's late night I'mma just drive through 
 I know it's hard for you 
 Do it too well, I don't wanna see you fail 
 They just try and make it hard for you 
 I know it's hard for you 
 Even though you a star to 'em 
 Everybody need love just pick up the phone and imma come through 
 And make it hard for you 
 And you know the summer's mine, fuck with a winner 
 Had to show you shit they ain't really wanna show you 
 Imma put you on game, run game on these other bitches 
 Told her never show no love for a bitch nigga 
 Keep it all business if you fuckin' with em 
 Never let your guard down even when the stars 'round 
 Get a lover baby if you in it for the long haul 
 If you pacing I can show your ass how to last long 
 I don't wanna see you up in every video 
 Every year all star cities I go 
 If there's money to be made I can understand 
 But don't fuck up your brand for a grand, you understand? 
 Somewhere in Miami gettin' all tan 
 With a flock of all tens, talkin' bout who they fuckin' 
 Ducks swim together baby just remember that 
 You got too much potential to lose so get rid of that 
 I know it's hard for you 
 You do it too well, I don't wanna see you fail 
 They just try and make it hard for you 
 Well me, I just fall for you 
 Even though I'm a star to you 
 Everybody need love just pick up the phone and I'll come through 
 And make it hard for you 
 Spendin' all your time on the internet 
 Checkin' up your wish list, things that you wanna get 
 Make a nigga pay for it, they ain't gotta wait for it 
 They just wanna fly you out, maybe bring a friend for 'em 
 I can tell you over that, been through hell and back 
 Fuckin' with the wrong one, you ain't try to double back 
 Time to find some love for that, lay up and cuddle that 
 In the club gettin' on, rather chill in bubble bath, parlayin' 
 And I know I ain't saying much 
 But you gotta learn to give trust 
 Even when it's no trust, you gotta find some 
 Being young on your own it's like the world against ya 
 I can bet I could preach that 
 Appreciate what I do for that 
 It's more what I came from if you cater back 
 Lemme guide you, get inside you, style you 
 Is what I'm getting at 
 It's hard for you 
 It's too easy if it's all for you 
 Anything that can ball for you 
 Don't wanna make it hard for you 
 When the sun rise, you be right there 
 Still shining like a star to 'em 
 Everybody need love just pick up the phone, I'll come through 
 And make it hard for you
