D.A 
 Slide on a pimp game with my pinky ring 
 Lotta gang, lotta bitches, and a icy chain 
 Why you claim that you rich? That's a false claim 
 I be straight to the whip, no baggage claim 
 Whole lotta styles, can't even pronounce the name 
 You ain't got no style, see you on my Instagram 
 I be rockin' it like it's fresh out the pan 
 Only when I'm takin' pics, I'm the middleman 
 Walk, talk it like a boss, I just lift the hand 
 3 million cash, call me rain man 
 Money like a shower, that's my rain dance 
 And we all in black, like it's Gangland 
 Say the wrong word, you be hangman 
 Watch me stick to your bitch like a spray tan

 Lotta girls like me, niggas wanna fight me 
 Nigga get yo ass checked like a fuckin' Nike

 And she gon' suck me like a fuckin' Hi-C 
 Aw, chains on the neck for the whole team 
 And I feel like Gucci with the ice cream 
 And my bitch want the Fenty, not the Maybelline 
 I'm the black JB the way these bitches scream 
 Make these bitches scream 
 Pretty little thing 
 Like my nigga A.E, say, yadadamean
