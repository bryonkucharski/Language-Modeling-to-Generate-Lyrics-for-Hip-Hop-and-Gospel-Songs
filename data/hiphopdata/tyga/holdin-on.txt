 Feeling's too strong, mmm, yeah

 Tyga 
 Now with both hands on it, I'ma hope 
 That you put your phone down, I'ma hope 
 Your girl tryna tell you I'm a hoe 
 I curved her a while ago 
 Now I go high, you go low 
 Why, oh, why, would you meet me at the middle? 
 You come and go 
 And come right back to my pillow (skrrt) 
 La di da di, Bugati in the driveway (skrrt) 
 Park sideways like it's my place 
 Hit your hot spot, that's a fireplace 
 Water on my wrist, she gon' hydrate 
 Gotta give me 24 hours 
 'Cause I'm with 24hrs 
 Got the money and the power 
 The world weighed me down but 
 24hrs 
 I'm holdin' on, on, yeah

 Feeling's too strong, mmm, yeah 
 So I'm holdin' on, yeah

 Now Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday 
 Friday, Saturday, Sunday are her days 
 Ay, if it ain't a race, why you run in the first place? 
 'Cause I'm a hurry to show you I'm the best one 
 I'm right now here and the next one 
 If you love her, let her go, I can't let you 
 go 
 I'm holdin' on like a three-year-old in your arm 
 Just like the chain I got, charm 
 Been on it for so long, Bugati still on your lawn 
 She a beast, she Queen Kong, she take it off and take it all 
 And I put both hands on it for 24hrs 
 24hrs 
 I'm holdin' on, on, yeah

 Feeling's too strong, mmm, yeah 
 So I'm holdin' on, yeah
