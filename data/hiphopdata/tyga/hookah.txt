Look out, you stupid bitch 
 I'm going to burglarize your home 
 I'm coming in here with my .20 caliber pistol 
 I'm going to rob you and kill your ass 
 Call the police on me 
 Call the police on me 
 Call the police on me 
 Call the police on me 
 You are going to be terrorized 
 You are going to be shot to death 
 You are not going to see tomorrow 
 I'm going to kill you and steal your hot rod 
 Call the police on me. 
 Call the police on me. 
 Call the police on me. 
 Call the police on me. 
 You life is going to expire as of now 
 Start picking out your coffin 
 I'm coming after you with an assault rifle 
 I'm going to look you in your eye and pump you full of led 
 Call the police on me. 
 Call the police on me. 
 Call the police on me. 
 Call the police on me.
