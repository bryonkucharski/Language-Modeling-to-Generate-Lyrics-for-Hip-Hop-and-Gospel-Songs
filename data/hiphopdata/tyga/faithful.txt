 Oh, you leavin' me, I'm leavin' me 
 I make you rock 
 Have faith in me, have faith in me 
 Have a lil faith in me, oh, have faith in me 
 When your road gets dark and you can no longer see 
 Let your boy throw a spark and have a lil faith in me 
 To get you a sensation, communication, penetration, stimulation 
 Ventilation, innovation, you get impatient but have a lil faith 
 Sensation, communication, penetration, stimulation 
 Ventilation, innovation, you get impatient but baby, baby 
 Have faith in me, just wait for me 
 Put all your weight on me, everything on me 
 Lean on me like the drink on me 
 And have faith in me, faith in me, yeah 
 You were blind and I made you see, yeah 
 Give me time, give me peace of mind 
 Love me faithfully, baby, baby, have faith 
 That face is first place, yeah, can't be replaced, yeah 
 I race to your side, I try and fail but never fail to try 
 (1) and try again, (2), and try again 
 I might have been outta my mind (true) 
 To my defense, pressure makes diamonds 
 And you see how I shine 
 So have faith in me, have faith in me 
 Have a lil faith in me, oh, have faith in me 
 When your road gets dark and you can no longer see 
 Let your boy throw a spark and have a lil faith in me 
 To get you a sensation, communication, penetration, stimulation 
 Ventilation, innovation, you get impatient but have a lil faith 
 Sensation, communication, penetration, stimulation 
 Ventilation, innovation, you get impatient but baby, baby 
 Tory Lanez 
 Have some faith in me, baby, know the stakes have been crazy 
 All this time has been passin', and now I'm talkin' action 
 Seatbelt fastened, got me in the speedway dashin' 
 Clean but I love it when she get nasty 
 She just passed me, keep a bad one with it 
 Just so she can make the threesome nasty 
 That's flashy and I'm classy 
 But real enough to fuck you in the backseat 
 Put you in the pad like you in a maxi 
 And have you runnin' to me like you in a track meet 
 You attract me but keep it on track 
 'Cause the fact is, I want you to have faith in me 
 It's gon' work, believe me 
 Tyga 
 So have faith in me, have faith in me 
 Have a lil faith in me, oh, have faith in me 
 When your road gets dark and you can no longer see 
 Let your boy throw a spark and have a lil faith in me 
 To get you a sensation, communication, penetration, stimulation 
 Ventilation, innovation, you get impatient but have a lil faith 
 Sensation, communication, penetration, stimulation 
 Ventilation, innovation, you get impatient but baby, baby 
 Have a lil faith in me
