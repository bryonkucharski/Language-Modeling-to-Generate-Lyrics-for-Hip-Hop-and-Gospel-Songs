Niggas work and work and make you work to live 
 Don't work, if that don't work, straps of work 
 Thank god this rap shit work, my niggas chill rap the work 
 My niggas will go back and forth 
 Tryin' to pack the work 
 I'm just tryin' to pack it back to Africa 
 More steps than my passport, nigga back to work 
 Fynna throw the hoodie on like a turban 
 Shit wasn't sweet when they left me deserted 
 And now I had a heart but you broke it 
 And now I had feelings but you hurt 'em 
 Now I'm turnin' up on everybody, you, you, you, you, you, you, and you
