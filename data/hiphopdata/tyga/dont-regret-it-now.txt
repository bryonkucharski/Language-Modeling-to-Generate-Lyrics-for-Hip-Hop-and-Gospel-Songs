Tyga: 
 What if your mother 
 Regretted having your brother? 
 Would you forgive her and kiss her 
 And tell her you love her 
 Or would you press it? 
 'Cause being the only child 
 Could leave ya feeling desperate 
 In need of attention every second 
 But since you man of the house you never get it 
 Pops left without a smile but you never miss him 
 But when you reminiscing 
 You wished you had a father figure 
 At least weekend's man pay a visit 
 Awww forget it 
 What about lil' Jason up in prison? 
 You think an 8 year old had bad intentions? 
 Pullin' the trigger on dad just barely killed him 
 Just wanted to protect moms from the brutal hittings 
 But he a kid so it's their word against his 
 Moms won't even testify scared of her husband 
 So he in for some years 
 Don't even know what he did 
 But can't forget it now 
 'Cause it's too late 
 (Chorus: Patrick Stump) 
 We come to life when first class takes flight 
 Only sing the lines that make you press rewind 
 Even dealing with electric, I think that he regrets in now 
 Heart in light, dying love 
 Everything looks better from above 
 You say it's getting old but I call it vintage love now 
 Don't regret it now 
 Both: 
 At a human's price 
 Trying to live that life 
 Can't slow down 
 Don't regret it now 
 Determined by that dice, you only roll twice 
 You broke now 
 Don't regret it now 
 Tyga: 
 Let's say you and your homie 
 Best friends one and only 
 Confidant who I trust, never phony 
 Just I and the young guy I called my brodie 
 We was like age of 5 since he known me 
 But now it's like hazy skies and in the mornings... 
 Waking up police say he died hollows pointed 
 Damn I can't believe you God... why you want him? 
 I needed him more than you. Now what, you lonely? 
 Just two more months man, we was good money 
 Now he can't go to awards and meet stars 
 I'm all alone now ridin' in luxury cars... 
 Life like a movie now someone press fast forward 
 So I can chill with him again and feel real 
 I rather have him here then this rap deal... 
 But he can't regret it now 
 Walking into that crowd... 
 Had his jewelry on 
 Next thing, man down 
 (Chorus: Patrick Stump) 
 We come to life when first class takes flight 
 Only sing the lines that make you press rewind 
 Even dealing with electric, I think that he regrets in now 
 Heart in light, dying love 
 Everything looks better from above 
 You say it's getting old but I call it vintage love now 
 Don't regret it now 
 Both: 
 At a human's price 
 Trying to live that life 
 Can't slow down 
 Don't regret it now 
 Determined by that dice, you only roll twice 
 You broke now 
 Don't regret it now 
 Patrick Stump: 
 Work twice as hard to get half as far 
 Love has legs, feet don't fail me now 
 Brand new boy, brand new year 
 Curtains open I am a grand finale 
 Did you get my voice mail? 
 Sorry I'm out having the time of my life 
 And I'm gonna do whatever you'd do 
 If you could be me for one night 
 Tyga: 
 If you could be me for one night (Night) 
 Could you live you're life under lights? (Lights) 
 Laminates, cameras, ice (Ice) 
 4 AM morning flights (Flights) 
 Uh I don't think you can handle that pal 
 I don't think you can handle this crowd 
 It's too late 
 Can't regret it now 
 It's too late 
 Can't regret it now 
 (Chorus: Patrick Stump) 
 We come to life when first class takes flight
