(Intro: Tyga) 
 We all dream one day we kings and queens 
 We all dream one day we kings and queens 
 My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream 
 My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream 
 (Verse 1: Tyga) 
 Uh, chandelier ceiling, my couch, don't sit with denim 
 My marble floors are killing, gold cars are so relentless 
 5 girls in the kitchen, they cooking something like chemists 
 Monumental shit is, statues like Egyptians 
 God cover my soul, need it, can't let it go 
 I know you get lonely when I ain't home, on the road 
 I know I ain't perfect, I'm out here working for the throne 
 I would take you along, but then that college loan you'll owe 
 Young girls in cheap dresses, tryna impress us 
 Saying they all different, but I don't show them no effort 
 Underestimated that [?], then I tested 
 Had to make investments, honey colored dressed it 
 I'm blessed it, cross-sign baptism West shit 
 Shit on anybody with opinions, you dead wrong 
 Go against a bull nigga head-on 
 I'm too strong, eight arms sticking to a bomb 
 Army stance, ready for war 
 We used a Andy Warhol to paint the decor 
 Apologizing for my actions, sometimes I get bored 
 They say my music knocks, so I hope it open every door 
 (Hook: Tyga (x2)) 
 We all dream one day we kings and queens 
 We all dream one day we be kings and queens 
 My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream 
 My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream 
 (Verse 2: Wale) 
 Never take this shit to heart, I take indo to chest 
 And now a nigga chasing dreams without losing his breath 
 Though my credits are slept, my ambition the best 
 Though I do this to be heard, I'ma do it to death 
 We in cool with all of these niggas 
 I'm through with all of these niggas 
 You fool with all of these niggas 
 You lose like all of these (niggas) 
 Honest, sincere, they seersuckers, lying in suits 
 Anybody riding with young'in will probably recoup 
 Heavenly Father, Martin, Malcolm mixed with them lyrics 
 Finna be king, but I'm way too proud to offer as minion 
 I just offer a guillotine to my vehicle, nigga 
 And don't offer the least of shit to these people's opinions 
 I'm a king to these niggas, love a queen, fuck the bitches 
 Double M-G, Y-M-C-M, B because we run this you dig? 
 We all kings, give anything to my soft queens 
 I'm lost without them, when they around I am Charles Sheen 
 (Hook: Tyga (x2)) 
 We all dream one day we kings and queens 
 We all dream one day we be kings and queens 
 My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream 
 My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream 
 (Verse 3: Nas) 
 You're in the presence of a majestic, esoteric 
 Message from the most ghettoest king, worldwide respected 
 I can say ghettoest 'cause I come from where metal spit 
 Praying to God I can slide and slip out the Devil's grip 
 Won't pop another pill, can't drink another sip 
 Tryna slow down with this pussy, I can't, I love this shit 
 I seem to love these whips - a white 
 Maserati's my birthright car, pass it, I need another hit 
 At night, where they murdered Herbie Draws 
 That's the same block Metta World Peace learned to play ball 
 See I'm born alone, die alone, from the hoods to the private home 
 College to prison, understand it, knowledge and wisdom 
 Shout out to baby mothers of niggas who gangbang 
 'Cause he could die any day and you still the same thing 
 So that make you a queen, surviving anything 
 Escobar season begins, so let the semis ring 
 Pimp of the year, I could smack your father 
 Not only with my hand, but with a black revolver 
 I been in pressed silk since breast milk 
 Mets cap on tilt, we some kings, nigga
