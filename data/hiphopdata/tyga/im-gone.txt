(Verse 1: Tyga) 
 Ugh, looking around glass, my future is in the past 
 I'm re-arranging my life, I'm single and now I laugh 
 All of the moments we had, beginning and just the end 
 At the end, stealing friends, heard I was on your hit list 
 Damn, now I'm driving Ferrari fucking random bitches 
 People saying I made it but I don't feel too different 
 Wayne told me "Close your eyes, they'll never see your Vision" 
 So I stay ready to die behind these Biggie lenses 
 Reinventing all the Audemars/Breguet shit 
 Just left the hood, word to the 5th Dist 
 Bout to cop a G to the roof like Diddy 
 And my city color purple nigga, no ceiling 
 It take time when you plying on the beat 
 I kill it, I bet I kill it 
 Producer witness to see 
 Bitches standing on they feet, handicap get out your seat 
 Got that buzz: Lil B, sting a bitch: Ali 
 Compare tighter rappers, but my songs greater 
 Just compare me to dope dealers and ball players 
 'Cause I'm a dope ass nigga and I ball player 
 Never save a hoe, can't even get a Life Saver 
 We gon fuck out way to the top and fall later 
 So I'mma fuckin' never call her later 
 Ugh, Skinny nigga got my weight up 
 Middle finger to my haters, why you chasing? 
 We ain't racing, Mufucka I'm gone! 
 Middle finger to my haters, mu-fucka why you hating? I'm gone 
 I ain't really wanna do it but I did it to em, nigga, I'm gone 
 Leave the beat shit alone, leave the bullshit at home, I'm gone 
 Even though I'm out of here, nigga gotta keep it real, I'm gone 
 (Verse 2: Tyga) 
 She fuckin' with me, these niggas ain't fuckin' with me 
 Got my mind on my money, my money piling up hundreds 
 You say you did it, I done it 
 You old nigga, I'm younger 
 You fold up under pressure 
 I'm good straighter then stretchers, Ugh 
 Bitches pecking my wood: Wood Chuckka Chuckka 
 Never gave 2 fucks: Double Rubbers 
 Now your color turn your face to a red Gusher 
 And your girl stick it to me like a car bumper 
 Never depended on anyone co-dependent 
 Kept my thoughts to myself, I don't need opinions 
 No middle man's, in the middle of my sands 
 Niggas thing they sweet, they can't even pay their incidentals 
 I'm detrimental, on any instrumental 
 I ain't pullin teeth, nigga better hide your pillow 
 To these rappers to the fucking grizzle 
 Bad to the bone, Red Zippers, Mike Jizzle, I'm gone 
 Middle finger to my haters, mu-fucka why you hating? I'm gone 
 I ain't really wanna do it but I did it to em, nigga, I'm gone 
 Leave the beat shit alone, leave the bullshit at home, I'm gone 
 Even though I'm out of here, nigga gotta keep it real, I'm gone 
 (Verse 3: Big Sean) 
 Big, Finally Famous in this 
 I say fuck sleep stayed up, fuck you, pay up 
 Always got the paycheck, never took a pay cut 
 Payday'll be worth all the broke nights I stayed up 
 So in my cup I'm mixing up whatever dreams are made of 
 Not too many Young G's made of what I am 
 So I was waiting on a doctor man, patient as I am 
 I guess the Young D-Boy made it into a man 
 With girls half-naked around, like we finna land the sand 
 Red-eyes to Rome and they connecting to France 
 With some bomb-ass pussy, that bitch came straight from Iran 
 My jewelry made in Japan, I'm off California drugs 
 And where I made my money? Nigga all of the above 
 I could count my inner circle on my hands and my feet 
 Passing joints long as a branch 'cause it's family tree 
 Doing "kush-ups" man cause the Weed too strong 
 I'm a G + 1 what's that muthafucka? That's gone
