(Chris Richardson) 
 Just to see her (see her) 
 But she's far far away 
 And I'd do anything just to see her face 
 But she's far far away 
 Walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again 
 (Tyga - Verse 1) 
 Sittin' on a plane 
 Reminscing back when I made that mistake 
 I wish it never ended with a heartbreak 
 Now your heartbroken, tears in ya face 
 Ask myself why, looking at the sky 
 If I could turn back I'd make it all right 
 Praying that you better but it's still stormy weather 
 Don't wanna let go but the rain won't let up 
 Now you gone, still thinking 'bout you every day 
 And I know feelings was hurt and you can blame me but 
 I'm sorry for the games that I played 
 But now it's too late 
 And now she's 
 (Chris Richardson) 
 Now she's far far away 
 And I'd do anything just to see her face 
 But she's far far away 
 Walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again 
 (Tyga - Verse 2) 
 It's cold putting up a fight 
 Arguing back and forth through the night 
 Regardless what I said and I don't most of it 
 You know I really love you, this the realest goin' get 
 It take time to realize what you really wanna know 
 You was ready for it all but your feelings I ignored 
 I know my fault, I should've gave more 
 Now you're miles away and I'm miles on tour 
 Now it's drums playing, crowd singing 
 Light changing, wish you was here to witness all that 
 It starts fading 
 They say two wrongs don't make it right 
 And I was wrong and now it ain't right 
 (Chris Richardson) 
 'Cause she's far far away 
 And I'd do anything just to see her face 
 But she's far far away 
 Walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again 
 (Tyga - Bridge) 
 Na na na nah 
 If I could turn back 
 If I could make it right 
 I'd do just that 
 If I could make it right 
 I'd do it all tonight 
 Hold you in my arms, with you I'd spend my life 
 Na na na nah 
 If I could turn back 
 If I could make it right 
 I'd do just that 
 I'd do just that 
 If I could turn back 
 (Come back here again) 
 (Chris Richardson) 
 'Cause she's far far away 
 And I'd do anything just to see her face 
 But she's far far away 
 Walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again 
 Na na na nah 
 If I could turn back 
 If I could make it right 
 I'd do just that 
 If I could make it right 
 I'd do it all tonight 
 Hold you in my arms, with you I'd spend my life 
 Na na na nah 
 If I could turn back 
 If I could make it right 
 I'd do just that 
 I'd do just that 
 If I could turn back
