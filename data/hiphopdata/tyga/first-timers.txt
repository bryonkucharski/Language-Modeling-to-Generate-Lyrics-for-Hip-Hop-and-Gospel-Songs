I mean I've been doing some thinking you know 
 And we only teenagers but I do love you 
 But I think we gotta move on 
 Don't cry though 
 Listen this is teenage love baby 
 When I'm alone all I'm thinking about is my girl 
 You smile your pretty face' and them light brown curls 
 At first I was playing and saying cause love is a horrible thing 
 The way straight to it didn't hesitate 
 Wit any these Tyga my friends call me fly than yah 
 X-men head is flying 
 Being honest I am more than what you can find in cereal boxes 
 Be my goddess higher in this world 
 I could take your body 
 Probably being a man is not an option it's a hobby 
 So you holding my hand is what other girls is watching 
 Picks up your prints in your locker 
 Put this lip gloss on and get the haters poppin' lil mamma 
 Teenage love [teenage love] 
 Teenage love [teenage love] 
 Teenage love [teenage love] 
 Don't don't don't hurt me again 
 Teenage love [teenage love] 
 Teenage love [teenage love] 
 Teenage love [teenage love] 
 Don't don't don't hurt me again 
 You call up the studio 
 I said about another hour 
 But you refused to hear it, saying baby do you miss me 
 But my intentions were to play this song when I visit you 
 Screaming up conversations everybodys trying to listen 
 But we only young and infacuated, sprung, in lust 
 I think I'm all the above two teenagers in love 
 I gave up them girls you gave up the club 
 I gave you everything you wanted just because 
 I was waiting for cupid to come shooting arrows through my heart 
 Now you wanna be apart 
 Watcha mean you finished 
 We only at the start and to leave when it girl we come oh so far 
 Teenage love [teenage love] 
 Teenage love [teenage love] 
 Teenage love [teenage love] 
 Don't don't don't hurt me again 
 Teenage love [teenage love] 
 Teenage love [teenage love] 
 Teenage love [teenage love] 
 Don't don't don't hurt me again 
 Listen up pivit its to risky 
 I don't get it 
 I'm feeling dizzy 
 The rooms spinning 
 You've got to be kidding 
 My teenages misses, you leave now my life is ended, my life is ended 
 Teenage love it's a teenage love [2x] 
 Don't don't don't hurt me again 
 It's a teenage love love love love [3x] 
 Don't don't don't hurt me again 
 Teenage love [teenage love] 
 Teenage love [teenage love] 
 Teenage love [teenage love] 
 Don't don't don't hurt me again 
 Teenage love [teenage love] 
 Teenage love [teenage love] 
 Teenage love [teenage love] 
 Don't don't don't hurt me again 
 Don't hurt me again 
 Don't hurt me again 
 Don't hurt me again 
 Don't don't don't hurt me again 
 Don't hurt me again 
 Don't hurt me again 
 Don't hurt me again 
 Don't hurt me again
