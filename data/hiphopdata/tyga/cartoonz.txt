T Y G A 
 Zippin', dippin' jabs super fast in a flash 
 It's Tygaman, Tygaman 
 Tatted up on my mask, superhero for the cash 
 It's Tygaman, Tygaman 
 My life is, my life is like a cartoon y'all 
 More crazier than, shh, you ever saw 
 I fume to the left and fume to the right and 
 Then I'm g-g-gone 
 Meet me, the Looney Tune 17 from the CPT 
 Ed, Edd 'n' Eddy couldn't beat me in more D's 
 Roll 22's on the whip, they call them 
 Fantastic Fours and shh, whoa I'm sick 
 Introducing, Billy the Kid 
 Space jammin' with Banana's In Pajamas 
 No homo, excuse my manners 
 I go from Hulk to David Banner 
 Land of bandannas 
 They Yosemite Sam ya, ya Fugazi like 
 Two Stupid Dogs' talkin' as they walkin' 
 I couldn't believe that, shh, oops I almost slipped 
 Porkey Pig dollar bills 
 Plus Tweety Bird sits on my wrist 
 Man, warning, you'll get booked like Orbitz 
 Your corpses will be with Yogi in the forest 
 Quick reminder on short notice 
 I got the swag potion 
 Take a sip until you're no longer sober 
 My life is, my life is like a cartoon y'all 
 More crazier than shh you ever saw 
 I fume to the left and fume to the right and 
 Then I'm g-g-gone 
 My life is, my life is like a cartoon y'all 
 More crazier than shh you ever saw 
 I voom to the left and voom to the right and 
 Then I'm g-g-gone 
 Stand down, we have a man down 
 I, Tasmanian devil in my bezel 
 The ice so heavy Bam Bam couldn't lift my pebbles 
 The Flintstones say the stones make you flint as you stare in it 
 Ridiculous bright with a little glare in it 
 The light beams off it like The Power Puff Girls who stare at it 
 My spaceship come equipped with a Jetson engine 
 To the milky way I'm dippin' 
 Bravo Johnny says, we're space pimpin' 
 With the huh, huh, ha, I always get 'em 
 The grill lookin' Ojish but not Simpson 
 I'm more like blue and yellow mixed, Marge Simpson 
 You lil' countin' chickens 
 Scooby Doo can't even figure out what Tyga's missin' 
 Maybe nothin', there's gotta be something 
 To rap, he's like carrots to Bugs Bunny 
 With cash I'm the Energizer Bunny, long money 
 My life is, my life is like a cartoon y'all 
 More crazier than shh you ever saw 
 I fume to the left and fume to the right and 
 Then I'm g-g-gone 
 My life is, my life is like a cartoon y'all 
 More crazier than shh you ever saw 
 I voom to the left and voom to the right and 
 Then I'm g-g-gone 
 Zippin', dippin' jabs super fast in a flash 
 It's Tygaman, Tygaman 
 Tatted up on my mask, superhero for the cash 
 It's Tygaman, Tygaman
