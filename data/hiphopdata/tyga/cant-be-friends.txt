Whether the game of love ends on a bad note. 
 Or being honest make the trust grow. 
 Apparentally it make you argue more. 
 The more things you throw. 
 DVD's and my dirty clothes. 
 Telling me shut up, I'm leavin' you. 
 The reason you ain't even got one. 
 It wasn't true. 
 Look at her, now look at you. 
 I know we ain't perfect. 
 But I made our world utopia. 
 How could you not notice? 
 In denial 'cause you're used to losin'. 
 Put me through, it ain't the answer to it. 
 Put on my Vans, take a walk to cool it. 
 But you was always a test and I'm a student. 
 Tryin' my best, 
 But I never get the right solutions. 
 I swear it's one thing after another one. 
 F-ck it I'm done. 
 Am I done? 
 Mother say I'm too young. 
 But what that mean? 
 I took a chance and now I'm playin', 
 The game of love. 
 Now it's never ending. 
 Forever chasin'. 
 That first feeling. 
 On a quest for a womans treasure. 
 They keep it hidden. 
 I gotta find love even if it kill me. 
 (I gotta find love even if it kill me.) 
 Can run into it anyday. 
 But knowing me I prolly never meet. 
 Only speak when a fan speak. 
 Never chattin' with a stranger. 
 But there's something about this girl that got me thinkin'. (Damn) 
 I-Phone accidentally called her. 
 Says hello? Silent moment. 
 Man, I been missin' you. 
 And I know you miss me too. 
 She sighed then she said, 
 Thought we'd be together till the end. 
 And this the end. 
 So good luck with your career. 
 'Cause we can no longer be friends anymore. 
 Damn.
