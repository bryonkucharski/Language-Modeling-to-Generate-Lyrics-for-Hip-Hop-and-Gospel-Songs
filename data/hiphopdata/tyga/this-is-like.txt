(Intro: Robin Thicke) 
 All white linen 
 Right until the sun comes down 
 See that we living like whoa-oh-oh 
 (Hook: Robin Thicke (x2)) 
 This is like riding through the city 
 With the ocean in the background 
 This is like flying in Paris 
 What your girl say now 
 Party down 
 (Verse 1: Tyga) 
 Uh, B-side, baby parlay 
 Waterfront top back, coupe with a fade 
 Tonight is ours, paper city, red ruby 
 You looking fine, as beautiful as one could ever be 
 Tires spinning, fast cars, fast women 
 And I just wanna get a night with a happy ending 
 The yacht life, hear the splash, so much class 
 Lift your glass, make a toast, we around the map 
 His and hers, Hermes bags, left the tag 
 All real love shit, with a scrub 
 Chillin' on top, get away, just a flight 
 Living life, this is what it's like 
 (Hook: Robin Thicke (x2)) 
 This is like riding through the city 
 With the ocean in the background 
 This is like flying in Paris 
 What your girl say now 
 Party down 
 (Verse 2: Tyga) 
 Uh, she's so relentless, body of a Goddess 
 Gotta take her higher 
 Rain through my window pane, she the fire to my flame 
 Good aim, put your heart where the sky is 
 It's cold down there but it's lonely up here 
 The world's so cold you gonna need a Montclair 
 Don't mind stare, when I look at you it's all clear 
 Tryna keep it together and ball like Rothstein 
 4-Seas, car clean, Harleys 
 I'm from the gold-era, my jewels is Gili 
 A party ain't a party if it ain't all night 
 Living life, this is what it's like 
 (Hook: Robin Thicke (x2)) 
 This is like riding through the city 
 With the ocean in the background 
 This is like flying in Paris 
 What your girl say now 
 Party down 
 (Bridge: Robin Thicke) 
 Like the film that you've never seen before 
 Yeah this is like a penthouse, served at the top floor 
 This is like love, that you can never get 
 From nobody else, whoa-oh-oh 
 This is like whoa... 
 This is like whoa... 
 This is like whoa... 
 This is like... 
 (Verse 3: Tyga) 
 All John Blaze, collar shirts, school days 
 On stage, a hundred thou, two days 
 Looking down on top from where the stars stay 
 Reservoir and back guards in the entry way 
 I'm young and wild and I charm our old mother 
 Invited your young daughter, I'm known across waters 
 Horses in the stable, Ferrari 'cause I'm able 
 Whole life I've been waiting 
 (Hook: Robin Thicke (x2)) 
 This is like riding through the city 
 With the ocean in the background 
 This is like flying in Paris 
 What your girl say now 
 Party down 
 (Outro: Robin Thicke) 
 This is like riding... 
 This is like flying... 
 This is like love...
