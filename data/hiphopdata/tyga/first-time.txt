Pharrell: 
 I know you wanna feel the girl (first time) 
 Now take it easy the first time 
 First time, first time, first time, first time 
 First time, first time, first time 
 Tyga: 
 First time, I ain't trying to hurt you now 
 But I think I'm in love for the first time 
 Top 9 certified 
 But I think I'm love for the first time 
 Top 9 certified 
 I think I'm love for the first time 
 Tyga - Verse 1: 
 First time I laid eyes 
 I looked around, heaven's angel from the sky 
 It must be a message from God 
 Cause you the only thing on my mind 
 Let me show you why 
 Tunnel of love let's float inside 
 Girl grab my hand now hold your ride 
 Take a chance for life, roll the dice 
 Next day we in paradise 
 Promise to be loyal when honest 
 Help out your family 
 With a couple dollars 
 I do my best for you 
 Cause you my shorty 
 So rest your head on my shoulders 
 It feels good, don't it baby 
 Tyga - Verse 2: 
 I know you ain't scared of tiger's 
 I get around, they say my sex on fire (fire) 
 Do it all night, keep you smiling 
 Used to be a player but I'm retired 
 Ugh, as I lay down right beside ya 
 No shirt, it's kinda hard to be quiet 
 She said hold me close never let go 
 I got that good love girl, oh you didn't know 
 Uh, give ya kiss, ear to ya neck 
 Relax, rub ya back 
 Make it wet 
 I know love have you going crazy 
 But it feel good, don't it baby
