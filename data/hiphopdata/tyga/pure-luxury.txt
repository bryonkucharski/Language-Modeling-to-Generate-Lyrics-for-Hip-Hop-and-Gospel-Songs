Old fucking drama, call the karma kamikaze 
 Shots of alcohol the pain its relic in my chest, I feel demolished 
 Hold the liquor, make it silence, pray into me like the altar 
 Life is off the loss and coughing I'm just here to make my offer 
 Crystal sniffing, bitches tripping, luxury and gang members 
 Wanna be like Boyz N Hood, affiliated by my brothers 
 Worship higher powers, smokes inpolished, drinking from the chalice 
 So they say it's his blood be like he was a Jesús 
 I'm holy, horrors making eye contact 
 Surviving the thrones, stones at yo front door, bang it though 
 When a nigga get dough, promise I pay you back mo' 
 You always had my back and I thank you for that 
 Wanna call you late, but I'm busy filling plates 
 Kids gotta eat and mommas gon' cry, that bread been straight, we shaking dank 
 Baby I'ma save you one day, from this hell hole and gunplay 
 Grew up with cinco hasta las cinco 
 Went east side where rain poured and souls cried, no sunshine 
 Tomorrow when tears dry, no one'll make it out alive 
 I just wanna make it God, can you hear me fine, here been deaf, feeling blind, all I see is sacrifice (overtime) 
 Show no remorse when you die, until then 
 Wash my sins with time, make yo bed (lay on the line) 
 Looking at headlines, it's all alive on who are you and I to decide, just tryna get by 
 And that's pure like virgin blood mixed with 1-51 one sip 
 Make a nigga flip, I ain't tripping off shit 
 That happened yesterday, 'cause I just wanna rest today in pure luxury 
 All my life I wanted luxury 
 A roof over to sleep 
 Family, that's luxury 
 All I ever hung around was G's 
 Breaking bread with the homies, that's luxury 
 Something like virgin blood that's pure and she screaming out "Its yours" 
 All I ever wanted was luxury 
 Now all I got is luxury, come fuck with me 
 20 bandana, cross my fingers when in danger 
 I protect you perfect stranger, put that body on a hanger 
 Her man's in Herman, (?) don't need a fucking filla 
 Hold my hand, your halo's fading, pesos and Pinot Grigio 
 Bless the newborns, my comrades they die for me 
 It's not the game, you just a casualty 
 War ruins who after me 
 Surviving, could have been a tragedy 
 Ninth grade, in a driver seat 
 Skipping class, no time to speak 
 Truth be told this honesty 
 Poker face and poke her highness next to me 
 I'm soaking royal altercationally 
 Not complacent, want the cake and cream 
 Settle in, you just another loyal fee 
 I don't smoke that reggie seed, high at the presidential suite 
 And I ain't at the legion seat nigga, overseas 
 With Sheikhs that's royalty nigga 
 You can bet that, my tux black 
 My bitch black and I'm backing out 
 That ghost black, black MX 
 Ain't gotta say shit, on the favor 
 All my life I wanted luxury 
 A roof over to sleep 
 Family, that's luxury 
 All I ever hung around was g's 
 Breaking bread with the homies, that's luxury 
 Something like virgin blood that's pure and she screaming out "its yours" 
 All I ever wanted was luxury 
 Now all I got is luxury, come fuck with me 
 When it all started a couple of months ago, I found that all of my friends were doing it, and I didn't want to feel left out. So, I went out and got one, and it's true what they say "you'll never forget the first time". When I put that big face right on, it felt like pure luxury
