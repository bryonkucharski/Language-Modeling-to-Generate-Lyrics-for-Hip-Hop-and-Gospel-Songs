(Verse 1: Tyga) 
 One shot, bomboclat 
 Bitches jumping on my dick, hopping like it's hopscotch 
 Booty pop, my bitch don't wear that she prolly ass shots 
 I don't give a fuck, I fuck 'em all till they pussy ouch 
 Potty mouth, oochie wally, bang, bang then I'm out 
 Once u-fucking-pon a time, had your bitch inside my house 
 Cooking grits and riding dick 
 Swear she the best chef around 
 Pop that pussy, now let me see you doo doo brown 
 I wanna rock, I wanna rock 
 Tell these bitch niggas it's they time of the month, time of the month 
 Niggas want beef but I eat that shit, eat eat everything well done 
 I'm so far in the clouds I can barely hear 
 All that shit you rocking, boy that was last year 
 GOAT's here, niggas steer my style like a stop deer 
 Pump fear 
 To you bitches heart, Suge without the beard 
 Man, all these new niggas weird 
 They all lining up to come and see the last king 
 (Hook: Tyga) 
 I get money, I make money 
 I take money, them bitches want it from me 'cause I'm 
 I'm 'bout whatever, I'm 'bout whatever 
 I'm 'bout whatever, man I do it, do it better 
 Two, two more shots, then I'm out 
 I'm a motherfucker and I got a potty mouth 
 I'm 'bout whatever man, I'm 'bout whatever man 
 I'm 'bout whatever, man I do it, do it better 
 (Verse 2: Tyga) 
 Man, I fucked your dime and now she's mine 
 2 Live Crew, put the pussy in my palm 
 She put on a nigga and make a grown man cry 
 Feeling bullshit, I don't pay you no mind 
 But what's your sign? Gemini? 
 Scorpio, let me fuck from behind 
 However you want it, baby 
 Light the blunts, blunts and close your eyes 
 Real nigga doe, real nigga doe 
 Got a freak bitch in the DB9, put me on doe 
 Came in the door, kicked in the door 
 Waiving the .44, put one, one in your blowhole 
 Man, you're paper thin, you need to take some notes 
 Niggas steal my lines and say they don't, there go another new quote 
 I'm fresh off the boat, nigga let's toast 
 Young Money real, y'all shit just a hoax 
 Made a fairytale, busy on a float 
 Why would I lie? 
 Forever under oath, I'm 
 So fucking frustrated with your lady 
 Get a flight, I send her home 
 Man my love is oh so tainted 
 If you fine you might get diamonds, if you a five you might get nothing 
 I'm on my monsters, they from a moshpit 
 R-r-r-rock you like Nirvana 
 Man I be off Patron like it's a holiday 
 Fucking with them finer things, pull up on your bitch and say 
 (Hook: Tyga) 
 I get money, I make money 
 I take money, them bitches want it from me 'cause I'm 
 I'm 'bout whatever, I'm 'bout whatever 
 I'm 'bout whatever, man I do it, do it better 
 Two, two more shots, then I'm out 
 I'm a motherfucker and I got a potty mouth 
 I'm 'bout whatever man, I'm 'bout whatever man 
 I'm 'bout whatever, man I do it, do it better 
 (Verse 3: Tyga) 
 Man, I fucked your dime 
 Still in my prime 
 Young D, I'm freshest nigga on the line 
 Better man up, it's about to go down 
 Leave you with jaw-dropped, face on the ground 
 Let the rain fill the moats 'round my kingdom 
 Carved in the cement, star, pledge allegiance 
 I'ma let you leave 'em screaming 
 Dreaming just to get by 
 Girl you so fly, why you so high? 
 Two more shots, then I'm out 
 I'm a motherfucking potty mouth 
 I'm 'bout whatever, I'm 'bout whatever 
 I'm 'bout whatever, man I do it, do it better 
 All bad bitches in my house 
 I'm a motherfucker, fuck her then I kick her out 
 I'm 'bout whatever, I'm 'bout whatever 
 I'm 'bout whatever, man I do it, do it better 
 (Verse 4: Busta Rhymes) 
 Cannibal, I eat you raw meat 
 I'm raw with beats 
 So scavenger with it, nigga look like Jaws with feet 
 You don't want it, bitch 
 Y'all niggas know I get gully, what you want? 
 Listen close, y'all don't hear how the beat get ugly when a motherfucker come through? 
 Excuse me bitch 
 Please let me kill it just a little bit and let a nigga do what he do 
 Movie shit, that tec make a niggas wanna vomit spit 
 You niggas already knew 
 She keep on fronting niggas, then I'm lighting up another city 
 Got her fighting till they get to biting, they we getting gritty 
 See the time and now a nigga climbing up another milli 
 Then we shining till a nigga blind them, up until it kills me 
 Forth and back and my dying is a nigga till it pulls up on the track 
 Then I'ma die sixty niggas till we pop off like we in the wild west 
 When I finished giving you the crack pipe 
 If you knew I'm in route to the crib just to park the Bugatti at the house 
 Sin big and one of my bitches really turn her out now 
 Still everyone know I got a potty mouth now 
 Shit they got me doing it again 
 Back to bodying things and lots of screwing other women 
 You can never stop the shit that I'm doing 
 And the way that we moving 
 Get it popping, never stopping, kill 'em in the end now 
 And I'ma get 'em to the point when I got 'em all open, handling my business with 'em ha! 
 Trust me you don't wanna start cause you know it's torture! 
 Every single minute till I finish with 'em 
 And I knock shit down 
 Every time I come and then I lock shit down 
 Till I come up place niggas better drop that crown 
 Ever here, 'fore I pop you clowns 
 And I go erase niggas!
