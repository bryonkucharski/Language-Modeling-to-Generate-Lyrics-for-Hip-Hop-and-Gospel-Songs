Bitch, it's TE-Raww, blood on my paws 
 Big booty chick back a nigga to the wall 
 Never get involved, murder every bar 
 Shit so illegal, get a green card 
 Different cause, different from y'all 
 I work hard, you work at the mall 
 Pass a bitch off like my nigga John Wall 
 Fuck in the dark, gimme the light, Sean Paul 
 Yeah, bitch I do this shit 
 Cooler than a motherfucking penguin lip 
 And my bitch pussy fire gotta extinguish shit, lebron james and shit 
 Got heat super freak Rick James ya bitch, leave a stain and shit 
 On ya couch in ya house like brotherman 
 Hanging like Mr. Cooper hand

 Bitch hold your damn breath cause you might die 
 Gotta group of bad bitches and I feel good 
 Oh your hungry? Too bad cause my meals good 
 And I shouldn't beat a broad, but I still would 
 But I won't try and be bad cause the deals good 
 Yeah, now look I got that urge to feed them off some gold and shit

 If a bitch fuck around, I'mma go off 
 My advice is she better dawn to go 
 You came to shop at the mall but I bought the stores 
 I got a box of jewels, I call it pot of gold 
 Got the cop to go, as my pockets grow 
 Check the chains and the rings and the watches bro 
 And I boxed a slut, I just boxed a ho 
 You tryna pass me bitch? It ain't possible, nah 
 I'm cool as fuck, I suggest you dress with the weather bitch 
 It's whatever bitch, whenever bitch 
 What a whore to a queen? Whatever bitch 
 I crop a kid, it's a hot to shit

 Tell them eat a dick, you are not a bitch 
 Find me at the club where my partners is
