They Ain't See it comin' 
 They Ain't See it comin' 
 Think I'm running around my mansion 
 Me and my family getting money 
 We been gettin' money 
 Nigga's know we run established 
 Tats across the stomach 
 Bitches say they love it 
 Say I'm thuggin' and I'm handsome 
 15 million singles sold 
 Who taught a hoe to make it nasty 
 They Ain't See it comin' 
 They Ain't See it comin' 
 Even Mommy know I'm flashy 
 Jesus show the worth 
 Daddy still in jail 
 Sister made me a bastard 
 Police wanna pat me 
 Niggas wanna dab me 
 Bitches love me like fashion 
 They don't wanna understand it 
 'Cause my ghetto manner show 'em who the fucking man is 
 They don't see me comin' 
 They don't see me comin' 
 You don't see me running, You don't see me thuggin' 
 They don't see me comin' 
 They just see me stunting 
 Push to the start, nigga I just hit the button 
 They don't see me comin' 
 They don't see me comin' 
 You don't see me running, You don't see me thuggin' 
 They don't see me comin' 
 They just see me stunting 
 Push to the start, nigga I just hit the button 
 Yo did you not see that fucking red light man 
 They don't see me comin' 
 They don't see me comin' 
 Run the light like DMX and belly 
 Machavelli, dark illuminati, talking crazy we gonna stomp 'em in the lobby 
 Fight night she just wanna party 
 Now we up in Dre's that's a hundred bottles 
 Crap table lost fifty thousand 
 When you work ems that's not a problem 
 They ain't see me comin' 
 They ain't see me comin' 
 When they see me all them niggas follow 
 Say you own all the shit you got 
 But the style you rock all borrowed 
 Getting money from day to day 
 I get paid like every tomorrow 
 Bitches I influence, niggas I influence 
 Who your fucking role model 
 Think I give a fuck about a motherfucking red light. Faggot cops can't touch me. That's me, untouchable 
 They don't see me comin' 
 They don't see me comin' 
 You don't see me running, You don't see me thuggin' 
 They don't see me comin' 
 They just see me stunting 
 Push to the start, nigga I just hit the button 
 They don't see me comin' 
 They don't see me comin' 
 You don't see me running, You don't see me thuggin' 
 They don't see me comin' 
 They just see me stunting 
 Push to the start, nigga I just hit the button 
 Going ball on you niggas 
 All my niggas gonna ball 
 Need a 100 bottles right now 
 I can hear the money talk 
 If you with me nigga, If you with me nigga 
 Let it go! 
 Threw my set up one time 
 Niggas looking from the floor
