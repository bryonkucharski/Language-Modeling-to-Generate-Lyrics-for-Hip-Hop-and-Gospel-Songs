I'm a young, 24 year old nigga 
 I come to take this game and bring it to me 
 We gon' be here 
 Ain't no fly by night nigga 
 We gon' be here two years, three years 
 I got this shit 
 Wire taps, y'all some grown liars 
 I'm Julius with Cleo betting on my empire 
 I'm busy in the jet, like a Spitfire 
 Grandiose in the house, looking like Granada 
 I'm pops to your daughter's daughter 
 Want my head like Pompeii, the Roman rider 
 I write you off like a speed infraction 
 I'm through with all the talking 
 Your misery got bad company 
 Fuck all y'all been 
 It's A-OK, symbolic 
 All the shit I embody 
 You might get shot but Johnny's driving nice cars 
 Tryna park it, don't you holla if it ain't my Gualla 
 Growing up where I'm from, iPhone to get you towed on 
 Located in bankroll, my niggas weight the dome 
 The shit I've waited for ever since Brenda Song 
 Told you that I'd make-make it home, motherfuckers 
 This ain't no ball game, mad ruckus 
 More like the Rucker, more like Christchurch, mother 
 Teresa cash, credit and visas 
 Not the car, but the passport feature 
 Need the passport if you're riding with the asshole 
 Tell her no bags, we shopping on tour, freak 
 We make a nice cold week and if you ass caught creeping 
 I'm balanced on the poppers, if I stop won't tell who dropping 
 I'm topic of discussion when it's who young with the money 
 I'm here, motherfuckers 
 I hear my name from the bleachers 
 But I'm too busy reaching 
 Looking up to deceased kings 
 Long live the last king, Martin had a dream 
 And it's me 
 Busy in the jet like a spitfire 
 Julius built my empire 
 Y'all some grown liars 
 Y'all some grown liars 
 Busy in the jet like a spitfire 
 Julius built my empire 
 Y'all some grown liars 
 Y'all some grown liars
