All day long, do it like Tony 
 F-ck her friend then I pass it to the big homie 
 Got a sign on my dick, bad bitches only 
 Got a sign on my dick, bad bitches only 
 Big bank roll, do it like Tony 
 F-ck her friend then I pass it to the big homie 
 Got a sign on my dick, bad b-tches only 
 Got a sign on my dick, bad bitches only 
 (Tyga - Verse 1) 
 Well it's that n-gga that you call T-Raw 
 Runnin' that money like Madoff 
 Yeah she gave that blow job then she get it laid off 
 I ain't got no time hoe, stop blowing up my cell phone 
 Sweatin' me like headbands, call that bitch Rondo 
 I'm fresher than the Prom hoe, teach ya we don't fly coach 
 F-ckin' but she act dumb, kick her out my condo 
 Real G's, Last King, Young Money ballin' 
 I give her a couple of shots and then she turn alcoholic 
 Metaphorically or Rhetoric 
 And I'm shittin' on your forehead 
 2 girls 1 cup?.Yup 
 We did it again Last King YMCMB 
 I don't pay for bitches, bitches pay me 
 (Gudda Gudda - Verse 2) 
 Uh, Knock knock, who the f-ck is there? 
 A sign on my dick that say, "bad bitches come in here" 
 Make a freak whore, detour straight to my partna room and let him beat it like a keyboard 
 All I do is dick 'em I don't tip 'em like a stripper man 
 I got a ton of chicks under my belt like a zipper, yeah 
 Walk up in the club, pick 'em out and then I pick 'em off 
 Pick 'em up and then knock 'em down and them I drop 'em off 
 I'ma dog keep your girl from round my type of shit or she'll be milk box material 
 And missing for the night man this shit is just that easy 
 When your pockets sittin' right 
 I turn my bed into a stage and let your girl rock on my mic
