Dial up seven digits 
 Car stripper, trife livin' 
 Show you what I'm paid but you won't get it 
 Already spent it, hundred thou ? 16? 
 Make you feel like the richest No! (niggas) 
 What happen when them cloths won't fit ya 
 And everybody asking for pictures, onto the next 
 One fan say ya sick man others say my shit weak 
 I do not sweat them, I am but a risk, band 
 Young money mulligan play gulf on ya head 
 Swing swing like lesbians and a man 
 Don't wanna share his wife but we already did (bitch) 
 Ghetto fly nigga form his ship 
 It's like amistad all black when we dip ah 
 Car with with rims ah don't matter what we in 'cause we already in forever 
 The end chivalry I good night this shit 
 Goodbye to the flaw say hello to you God 
 Readin the choir overseas ummm... 
 Such a globe traveler, farchulin while you where at home 
 I was busy ordering steaks threw the phone like medium rare, no wait well done 
 Don't care if you won 
 Tyga I am the one 
 This is why I'm ill 09 until 
 This is why I'm ill 09 until 
 This is why I'm ill 09 until 
 Forever y'all 
 This is why I'm ill 09 until 
 This is why I'm ill 09 until 
 This is why I'm ill 09 until 
 Forever y'all 
 I really kick flow 
 I really been broke 
 Look at me now doe everynight another show 
 What are those doe 
 Glow in the dark shoes 
 How you get those 
 Wish I really knew 
 Like mario, my city red and blue 
 Born from L.A. eat roscoes 
 Lucy tacos knew some vatos 
 Tat tata tat ink like kinkos 
 I put a dollar in the pot watch the pot grow 
 I pop up with the heat like hot toast 
 You would recycle if you see what I knew 
 So keep your eyes closed and lower your IQ 
 I feel like two, they can judge me but there's no gaffle and stool 
 Only gospel can save you good music immune 
 I'm ill sick my lyrics like pew 
 This is why I'm ill 09 until 
 This is why I'm ill 09 until 
 This is why I'm ill 09 until 
 Forever y'all 
 This is why I'm ill 09 until 
 This is why I'm ill 09 until 
 This is why I'm ill 09 until 
 Forever y'all
