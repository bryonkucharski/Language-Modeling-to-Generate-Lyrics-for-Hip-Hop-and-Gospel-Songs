(The ceiling's falling in, every time you don't know where you've been) 
 (Our love, seventeen to lifetime) 
 (The seasons change when we all stay the same) 
 (The pain I felt back then won't ever go away) 
 (Echoes call me back to the feeling again) 
 (Echoes call me back to the feeling again) 
 (Echoes call me back to the feeling again) 
 (Tyga) 
 At this point, I realize love is not an emotion I can neglect 
 My queen thought I wasn't ready for love. She was right 
 What did love mean to me? It didn't mean anything 
 Compassion, affection... I just know I wanted it back 
 Can't be a king without love 
 Love...
