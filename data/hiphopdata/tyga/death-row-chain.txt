My Death Row Chain got a pharaoh face 
 My dandelion on 
 Yeah daddy home 
 Little daddy got to put his family on 
 Told my mama I'm daddy too 
 I give my son the sun and the moon 
 Told my son stay out daddy closet 
 I got a chopper and it's new 
 Yeah I got a chopper and it's not a toy 
 Told my boy stay out daddy's room 
 (1) 
 It ain't safe to play 
 What I say him I'm a say to you 
 It ain't safe to play 
 It ain't safe to play 
 Safe it ain't 
 It ain't safe to play 
 AK by the safe so the safe is safe 
 (Pre) 
 My Death Row Chain got pharaoh face 4x 
 Might go blind staring in his face 
 My Death Row Chain make her toss it up, I ain't my at you 
 My Death Row Chain come floss with us, live and Die in Los Angeles 
 My Death Row Chain keep talking up, look for me 
 (2) 
 My Death Row Chain at the Vibe Awards 
 Stab a ni**a these diamonds hurt 
 This ghetto slang my finest work 
 Million Dollars in the passenger 
 My Death Row Chain make her back it up 
 Everyday I look like an album cover 
 My Death Row Chain going platinum plus 
 My Death Row Chain got them lapping up 
 Two seater Benz Puerto Rican twins 
 Told'em fassen-up 
 Pulled off fast as fuck 
 My Death Row Chain keep added up 
 Two on me then 
 Three on me now 
 Four on me now 
 She like my Death Row Chains on when we fuck 
 (Repeat)

 It ain't safe to play 
 What I say him I'm a say to you 
 It ain't safe to play 
 It ain't safe to play 
 Safe it ain't 
 It ain't safe to play 
 AK by the safe so the safe is safe
