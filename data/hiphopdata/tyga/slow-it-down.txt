Now that shorties in my bedroom saying "what should we do?" I said "hey, don't slow it down" 
 Now that shorties up in my place saying do it her way 
 I said "hey, don't slow it down" 
 Slow it dooooown. [x4] 
 Uh, gotta find her. 
 Thought to my mind, don't wanna be lonely tonight 
 Whatever 
 Stepped out, threw my diamond s sweater 
 On to the grocery, quarter eleven 
 The aisles with the beverages, 347 
 Seen two college chicks, why you gigglin? 
 I asked, they said "you be on television" 
 "Wait, your Tyga, my friend wants a picture" 
 So you live close by? Next thing I'm looking in her eyes 
 Now that shorties in my bedroom saying "what should we do?" 
 I said "hey, don't slow it down" 
 Now that shorties up in my place saying do it her way 
 I said "hey, don't slow it down" 
 Slow it dooooown. [x4] 
 Uh, gotta find her. 
 Thought to my mind, don't wanna be lonely tonight 
 Whatever 
 Later on, hit the club. I'm chillen 
 Funny how time flies when you in it 
 Valet Bentley, gently tinted 
 Seen misses, she use to stay in my building 
 Ten fifty 
 God, never seen you in a dress before 
 So you moved? Where to? 
 "To the hills of Hollywood, you should come... visit... soon" 
 Now that shorties in my bedroom saying "what should we do?" 
 I said "hey, don't slow it down" 
 Now that shorties up in my place saying do it her way 
 I said "hey, don't slow it down" 
 Slow it dooooown. [x4] 
 (Break-down) 
 Hoooou, ooh (no need to rush it, ya know) 
 So take your time 
 As the one for me 
 So ease your mind 
 As the one for me 
 Uh, I'm feeling better already 
 We've been steady 
 Put a diamond lump on your damn pinkie 
 I do miss you, just been busy 
 Do you miss me? 
 How bout I come get you? 
 Now that shorties in my bedroom saying "what should we do?" I said "hey, don't slow it down" 
 Now that shorties up in my place saying do it her way 
 I said "hey, don't slow it down" 
 Slow it dooooown. [x4]
