(Tyga: Verse 1) 
 Fuck that, fuck shit pay me 
 Rumors come and go, so I stay in a room presidential lately 
 Top of the roof, if a nigga start hating 
 Talk that shit, I aim for debating 
 Man I swear the game got so Clay Aiken 
 Bought a new crib, your bitch says it's spacious, Hagh 
 Ride to the motha fucken money (yeah) 
 Man I swear this shit about nothing (yeah) 
 Why you niggas ballin on a budget 
 Boy don't get close, I press that button mothafucka 
 Leave a nigga roughed up, David Ruffin, Hagh 
 Niggas washed up, start scrubbing 
 Nigga get you covered in some clovers 
 You're an unlucky, mothafucka 
 Don't be fuckin' wit a young nigga 
 That's T-Many, one fuckin' problem 
 Really monsters need a doctor 
 I'm the sickest nigga 'bout it 
 No deciding, just a silence 
 On the sizzle, P90 
 Kill yourself like you're in college 
 It's finals; cocky 
 Bitch don't fight it (uh) 
 Viam turn to violence (uh) 
 Cash money party, guess you broke niggas ain't invited 
 Got a bad bitch riding 
 She dumb but she get knowledge 
 I ain't come to be vibing but my personality vibrant 
 I'm in love wit nobody, white bitches they hotties 
 Hop up off my crotch, I'm the shit, need a potty 
 She lucky she with me 
 Unlike them other niggas, I got it 
 T la-di-da-di, welcome to my house party 
 (Hook x2: Tyga) 
 Fuck nigga, get yo bands up 
 Fuck nigga, get yo bands up 
 Fuck nigga, get yo bands up 
 We getting money, we turnt up 
 (Verse 2: Honey Cocaine) 
 Yellow bitch and I got this 
 It's that black market, I'm shopping (uh) 
 Last Kings and we bossing 
 Well I'm the first queen there's no option (uh) 
 I heard they hating, I don't give a fuck 
 Tell 'em to fuck and suck on my cunt 
 Bitch get some dick 'cause you doing too much 
 I'm getting mine and enough ain't enough 
 Getting richer 
 Money perfect picture 
 Oh no, I ain't messing at the studio with your ninja 
 Top the name, I diss her 
 Kill your bitch, you gon' miss her 
 Bring that body shop and now watch that coffin fit her 
 Funeral home, bring you to the zone 
 Get you and your crew, or just you alone 
 I don't give a fuck, I don't take no breaks 
 Body your ho put her in her place 
 Now I'm out (uh) 
 Don't try it at your house 
 Young gold Asian, and they know what I'm 'bout, bitch 
 (Hook: Tyga)
