Rap star, need fast cars, cash in large amounts 
 I need a bitch with an ass that bounce 
 A fat ass and titties that bounce 
 You know I'm in the street when the city come out 
 When the city dumb out 
 When you envision me 
 (Can you tell me) am I getting it though? 
 I'm a rap star, call the task force 
 I make your club collapse 
 After I leave with the bad ones 
 Presidential suite with the bad ones 
 Told my niggas y'all can have them 
 'Cause I have one, I'm on FaceTime with her 
 When she blowing you kisses, saying she miss ya 
 Could have anyone she want, she just wanna be with ya 
 I'm a rap star, I just wanna get richer 
 You might slip when I talk, you know I'm slick when I talk 
 Rap star, got plaques on my wall 
 That's art and facts on my wall 
 Crib I bought got two gates for security guards - it's a palace dog! 
 I remember when I have it dog 
 And back then I was still saying I'ma have it dog! 
 (Could you imagine?) 
 I'm a rap star, need fast cars, cash in large amounts (That's all) 
 I need a bitch with an ass that bounce (That's all) 
 A fat ass and titties that bounce (Rapstar) 
 You know I'm in the street when the city come out 
 When the city dumb out 
 When you envision me 
 (Can you tell me) am I getting it though? 
 I'm a rap star, can you imagine? 
 Putting chains on ya man's neck, cause the muscle stronger the fan flexin' 
 Dealing with gossip, hate and threats 
 When they bettin' against you and you raise the bet 
 Yeah, you got 'em there nigga, you got 'em scared 
 They not prepared, you got 'em right where you want 'em, right there 
 I'm a rap star and your nightmare 
 Used to slapbox, now we don't fight fair 
 Life ain't, so I ain't 
 This about my team, 'cause they ate when I ate 
 Yeah they steak like my steak 
 Handle they beef like it's on my plate 
 I'm a rap star that graaa, graaa, graaa 
 That "move, let 'em through, get back" 
 (Could you imagine?) 
 I'm a rap star, need fast cars, cash in large amounts 
 I need a bitch with an ass that bounce 
 A fat ass and titties that bounce 
 You know I'm in the street when the city come out 
 When the city dumb out 
 When you envision me 
 (Can you tell me) am I getting it though?
