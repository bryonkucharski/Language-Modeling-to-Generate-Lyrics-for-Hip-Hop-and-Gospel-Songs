Looking at myself, I see the man, nigga 
 I'mma call it like I say it, I'mma call you bitch made nigga 
 All of this is not to entertain niggas 
 I got held up at the light reaching for my switchblade, nigga 
 Poppers on a Spanish with the gauge, nigga 
 If I tell you that the babysitter's dead, don't play, nigga 
 Reach inside your pockets, dial H, nigga 
 If you need help with pressure, don't drive this way, nigga 
 You know I got schizophrenic tendencies 
 I dream of porn stars and pouring gas on my enemies 
 If I get a check, I'm not the vet 
 I'm a dawg ass nigga looking for a hot bitch 
 Shaka Zulu with the new do with the TEC 
 This is not a purchase, everyday life shit 
 I've been praying for your downfall, man 
 But all I see is bad bitches coming down the hill, damn 
 Shaka Zulu new do with the TEC 
 Don't tell anybody that the babysitter's dead 
 And I heard it from a birdie, it was dead 
 How'd they bring you back to life? That's a start resurrect 
 She bowed to her knees, want forgiveness 
 But all I could think about was coming out of speakers 
 She a fun girl living on the edge 
 Poppa ran a hedge fund, all his daughter do is give head 
 Said he had it up to head and neck 
 Don't you point the thing at me, it could go off offside your head 
 Temple to the brain, now he dead 
 That's a life learned lesson, never stress over bullshit 
 Wasn't even her why he did it 
 But he found his wife with his daughter's boyfriend, nigga damn 
 That's some fucked shit over sex 
 These bitches overrated and I judge 'em like "who next?" 
 Temple to the brain from the TEC 
 Don't you tell anybody that the babysitter's dead 
 And I heard it from a birdie, it was dead 
 How'd they bring you back to life? That's a start resurrect, nigga 
 Shaka Zulu new do with the TEC 
 Don't you tell anybody that the babysitter's dead 
 And I heard it from a birdie, it was dead 
 How'd they bring you back to life? That's a start resurrect, nigga 
 Six weeks, had to vacate 
 Ain't a resident in sight, just a beach, making sex tapes 
 Sure, say the shit to my face 
 She gon' get me off, nigga, like bug spray 
 Bitches all fake and fanatics, causing ruckus with a ratchet 
 Don't you put that on your loved ones, you are not my level pattern 
 This is Pacquiao and pack it peddle faster like a Flintstone 
 On a roll, full of ashes, we just run you, this the legion 
 Zulu, it's all gone 
 Zulu, forever perished 
 Ten bedrooms in the palace 
 But your Playboy bunny's ears full of carrots, I told y'all 
 Shaka Zulu new do with the TEC 
 Don't you tell anybody that the babysitter's dead 
 And I heard it from a birdie, it was dead 
 How'd they bring you back to life? That's a start resurrect, nigga 
 Temple to the brain from the TEC 
 Don't you tell anybody that the babysitter's dead 
 And I heard it from a birdie, it was dead 
 How'd they bring you back to life? That's a start resurrect, nigga 
 Temple to the brain from the TEC 
 I go temple to the brain from the TEC 
 Don't you tell anybody that the babysitter's dead, nigga 
 Glory be, lord to be 
 Fashion so fucking unorderly 
 Move accordingly, don't order me 
 You poorer than me, more can afford the fee 
 Word to Meek, 100 in the dungarees 
 Who claim the game, we're young living like Meek 
 Click on the tee, Lord of Rings, you order me 
 Theatric fairytale's become extinct 
 Fuck the peace, I put a piece on my neck 
 'Bout the size of a Complex magazine 
 I'm not for sale, I bought your dreams 
 Leonardo DaVinci, the Bentley boost my self-esteem 
 Bitches cling like the chain already been doing the same thing 
 I mean this gold for press, G 
 I'm tryna bob and weave, why you chasing me? 
 I'm on my victory lap, can't you see? 
 Temple to the brain from the TEC 
 Don't you tell anybody that the babysitter's dead, nigga 
 I go temple to the brain from the TEC 
 Don't you tell anybody that the babysitter's dead, nigga
