I shine and no one else shines, I think everybody shines in different things 
 I know how to go to that true spot in myself because I'm there everyday 
 I can be me, I can be whoever because I'm true to me 
 I can go to neutral easy, a lot of people black, white, Mexican, young, old, fat or skinny 
 Have a problem being true to themselves 
 Dolla Bill and Tyga man, I call that comradery 
 Dolla Bill and Tyga man, I call that comradery 
 Dolla Bill and Tyga man, I call that comradery 
 Dolla Bill and Tyga man 
 Dolla Bill rest in peace 
 Dolla Bill and Tyga man, I call that comradery 
 Dolla Bill and Tyga man, I call that comradery 
 Dolla Bill and Tyga man, I call that comradery 
 Dolla Bill and Tyga man 
 Dolla Bill rest in peace (rest in peace) 
 Reportin live from a good soul (?) Roderick 
 I met Dolla, spirited piece I know you're watchin' 
 Carried his coffin, dearly departed young artist 
 Who said it loudly, losing was never a damn option 
 First met my nigga we was up in Arizona 
 Told him I got some bitches for you up in California 
 Never knew May 18th you'd be in California 
 I swear to God, God go get them niggas homie 
 Cases only, if they hit and we make bail, we may bail 
 Then landed up in ATL, club dream (?) 
 She was like "what's that mean?" (what's that mean?) 
 Something like a secret society 
 And I was up the street, I wish you would've called me 
 Shoutout for T money, the gang EMT 
 Sending my condolences from Young money GED 
 Dolla Bill and Tyga man, I call that comradery 
 Dolla Bill and Tyga man, I call that comradery 
 Dolla Bill and Tyga man, I call that comradery 
 Dolla Bill and Tyga man 
 Dolla Bill rest in peace
