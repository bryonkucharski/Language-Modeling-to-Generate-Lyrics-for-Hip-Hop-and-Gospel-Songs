Walk up on this bitch with a hundred grand 
 Two rollies on my arm, another hundred grand 
 Bitch, let the money burn, nigga no tan 
 Got a young bitch, fucking doing what she can she can!

 Whistle while you twerk pussy singers all up in the club throwing up middle fingers 
 If you try snitch turn a bitch to a hanger 
 Lay your shit out, now you're planking, you're planking

 Break a bitch heart pouring out the champagne 
 Why you over there chilling with the little lames? 
 You ain't know, you ain't know that my shit bang?

 Put ice on my wrist like the shit is praying
