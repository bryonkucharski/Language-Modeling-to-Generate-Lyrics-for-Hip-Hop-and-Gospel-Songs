While my emotion grows, I still won't let it show 
 I still won't let it show 
 Even if I'm broke, I still won't let it show 
 I still won't let it show 
 (Verse 1 - Tyga) 
 Nigga, welcome to my life 
 Life feels like I'm running through a red light 
 Don't believe what the blogs write 
 Mufuckas wanna know me so they call me Mike 
 I'm just chillin', watching the fight 
 Few friends, fake girls, pour me some ice 
 Table glass slippers on, lower the blinds 
 Never been shy, I just ignore lies 
 Take a look into Tyga's eyes 
 I breathe love but inhale the hate bomb 
 So numb my face gone, I need my space 
 And I don't do Facebook 
 Seriously how my face look 
 How could a man cry while the crowd looks? 
 Could you walk with me if I give you my foot? 
 Didn't think you could... 
 While my emotion grows, I still won't let it show 
 I still won't let it show 
 Even if I'm broke, I still won't let it show 
 I still won't let it show 
 My mind overloads I still won't let it show 
 I still won't let it show 
 People I love the most, I still won't let it show 
 I still won't let it show, I won't let it show 
 (Verse 2 - Tyga) 
 I don't wanna feel like most rappers feel when they get a deal 
 Like, "Yeah I'm bigger than him, he's still loco" 
 Gotta keep it real 'cause they will go loco 
 Like "He ain't ever go through shit we go through" 
 So I guess now I owe you 
 No, now I hold you, watch the niggas close to you 
 Don't compare careers, his and his fools 
 Acting like I knew you back in middle school 
 Dropped out, mama said I was a fool 
 I brought the drop out now me and mama cool 
 Told her I won't lose, showed her a Jimmy Choo 
 She call me son now, tell me she real proud, smiles 
 Oh what a feeling to be loved 
 Oh what a feeling to be loved 
 I wish I could fly like a dove 
 While my emotion grows, I still won't let it show 
 I still won't let it show 
 Even if I'm broke, I still won't let it show 
 I still won't let it show 
 My mind overloads I still won't let it show 
 I still won't let it show 
 People I love the most, I still won't let it show 
 I still won't let it show, I won't let it show 
 (Bridge - Tyga speaking) 
 I've learned that people will forget what you say 
 People will forget what you did or done 
 But people will never forget how you made them feel 
 Don't cry because it's over 
 Smile because it happened 
 (Verse 3 - J. Cole) 
 Cole World, niggas ran for that heat 
 As the globe twirl gotta stay up on your feet 
 Before I say it to my girl, I say it to the beat 
 Then I play it for the world 
 And they say that shit is deep 
 My life is changing as we speak 
 They acting like they never seen a nigga on the beach 
 I say "peace" hope there's no sharks in my water 
 Then holla at my mama, man she love to see Obama 
 Do his thing, now look how far niggas done came 
 They had us on the chains, now we coppin' bigger chains 
 Now they say that it's smart, old nigga don't trip 
 But they had us on the whips, now we counting bigger whips 
 Oh shit, wonder how bad will it get before he rise 
 I'm out here trying to get rich: I survive 
 And a nigga got God to thank 
 And I'm still throwin' 5 in the tank, nigga Cole! 
 While my emotion grows, I still won't let it show 
 I still won't let it show 
 Even if I'm broke, I still won't let it show 
 I still won't let it show 
 My mind overloads I still won't let it show 
 I still won't let it show 
 People I love the most, I still won't let it show 
 I still won't let it show, I won't let it show
