Unreal to a close eye, 
 Can't feel but you heard that I'm close by 
 It's more vivid the image invented in my mind, 
 I look around and really I see a fake smile 
 No time, when the tickets down, 
 My Rolex style don't mean shit now 
 It's just another pay cut my mind made up 
 Unnecessary lay-ups 
 You can still win n got a rich n star player 
 Fuck a hater still remain-a-self-made nigga 
 Live bigger, credit cards no limits 
 I drop 20 on the luggage took 10 minutes 
 I don't shop online those are all gimmicks 
 Only make moves when your heart's in it 
 B.I.G. 
 said it; so I entertain like 
 Cedric 
 Standin' on the trunk roof top unit city 
 Batman, spotlight, gotta say you bitches 
 The jokes on you Jack, 
 Who the fuck you gon call when your shit towed, by the repo 
 Can't tell your girl so she the center fold 
 Now you gettin' played like Casio's; uuh 
 Casino's, C-notes and chips like Fritos 
 Got a free coat, when Costa Rico 
 Most hoes only know two words 
 Like "Gimme those,", still buy 'em though 
 Currently ballin' so I gotta let you know 
 Flash through the tint roll the window 
 Tilt the brim 
 What the fuck I did, let me see your registration 
 Imma keep it real kid I'm just hatin' 
 Ain't a opportunity I ain't take close chase 
 City national bank evolve into shape 
 Of a dollar then I duplicate, 
 Motherfucker don't believe let me demonstrate 
 I dream the motherfucker try to kill me in my sleep 
 What's the point to steak when niggas want beef 
 Diss me 'cause they hungry made a meal that you couldn't eat 
 You fuckin' snakes in the rat race two-face bitches 
 That's why I don't fuck wit' none of y'all niggas 
 'Cause soon y'all fell when you fell wit' 'em 
 It's like puttin' '87 in a Bentley; nigga don't tempt me 
 Everything ain't everything 
 Shit ain't always what it seems 
 I put that on everything no sleep having light dreams 
 What I see is what I can't reach I put that on everything 
 Goin' crazy, I might be no sleep having light dreams 
 I dream (I dream) 
 Everything ain't everything 
 Shit ain't always what it seems 
 I put that on everything no sleep having light dreams 
 What I see is what I can't reach I put that on everything 
 Goin' crazy, I might be no sleep having light dreams 
 I dream (I dream)
