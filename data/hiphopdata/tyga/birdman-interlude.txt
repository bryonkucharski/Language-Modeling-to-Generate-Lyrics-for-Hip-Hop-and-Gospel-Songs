(Birdman) 
 The young king... the lil homie Tyga 
 It's yo turn, nigga... it's yo turn, playboy 
 West Coast stand up to this Careless World, people 
 Global flying on this journey... 
 Tropical islands, poppin' bottles with supermodels... 
 Blowing up the pounds (sunup to sundown)... 
 Flying at higher heights... grinding hard... 
 Money by the abundance... 
 Yeah, YMCMB flashy life... 
 What it do, young king... it's yo turn, boy...
