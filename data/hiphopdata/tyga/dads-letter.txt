Smoke dawg baby, remember that shit. 
 Young light skinned, born leaked every pen 
 Since I was 10 prolly name all the trouble I did. 
 Neva participated I'm like fuck all them other kids 
 Like I don't owe you child shit when I make it big 
 But a little respect, fuck what y'all really expect 
 Never raised a gentlemen like Ne-Yo said. 
 Lookin' for hero heads, but I don't see none yet. 
 All my friends weenin cigarette so I take a hit, 
 That's some potent shit. 
 Ol' nigga police man, I ain't scared a shit, 
 But hell yeah I ran. 
 Lost my money clip ever since wrap rubberbands. 
 Biggity bam did a couple of scams made a couple of grands. 
 Fast forward to the 4th escort I ball with it 
 So quick 14 no license, that's some awful shit 
 Now must stack ketchup like condenments 
 Kinda jss wish you taught me how to be a man. cuhs 
 Growin' up all I wanted was a father figure 
 Me and mom alone every dinner. 
 One day I hope you hear this I pray you doin' better. 
 This what it sound like if I sent my dad letters. 
 If I sent my dad letters. 
 This what it sound like if I sent my dad letters. 
 One day I hope you hear this I pray you doin' better. 
 This what it sound like if I sent my dad a letter. 
 Word is, 10th grade kick out the crib 
 Like where I go from here, lucky I had a girlfriend. 
 Remember money make the world spin 
 Runnin' around the big body bends wonderin who in this that's pedestrian 
 Spoiled kid, never that. 
 Worked to hard to get where I'm at. 
 Thinking fuck school, but next semester I'll be back 
 I hated rules, but ruling the world I often dream of that. 
 Dream of meetin you dad. 
 Moms really getting mad when I call you that. 
 I don't understand 
 Your phone numbers all I ask. 
 She laughs with her jaw dropped like the movie mask. 
 Damn so I then reply resort to raising my own little man. 
 But I'm too young for that, wait I take that back 
 I shoulda used the hat. my girl gettin' fat. 
 Whatever results make sure that, I'll be there like you wasn't dad. 
 Growin' up all I wanted was a father figure 
 Me and mom alone every dinner. 
 One day I hope you hear this I pray you doin' better. 
 This what it sound like if I sent my dad letters. 
 If I sent my dad letters. 
 This what it sound like if I sent my dad letters. 
 One day I hope you hear this I pray you doin' better. 
 This what it sound like if I sent my dad a letter. 
 Double 09 lately really it's been on my mind. 
 The pain eatin me alive one verse at a time. 
 And this heart problem ain't helpin at all. 
 It's a cardiac diagnose, just wanna stay at home. 
 Dyin' slow so I bought a fast car, and a couple of charms. 
 Now family and old friends wanna be involved. 
 Some nigga tryna marry mom he like my songs. 
 I find it odd sometimes wanna fucking shoot his head off. 
 Am in the wrong, didn't think so movin on. 
 I'm working on my new album if you singing songs. 
 But rap is what I does. 
 Turnin' 20 soon, then 21 then 22 like emmette was. 
 Everybody sleepin' on me time to wake 'em up 
 Now everybody chasin us like they missed the bus 
 And girls wanna roll like a blunt 
 P.S. your only son. 
 Growin' up all I wanted was a father figure 
 Me and mom alone every dinner. 
 One day I hope you hear this I pray you doin' better. 
 This what it sound like if I sent my dad letters. 
 If I sent my dad letters. 
 This what it sound like if I sent my dad letters. 
 One day I hope you hear this I pray you doin' better. 
 This what it sound like if I sent my dad a letter.
