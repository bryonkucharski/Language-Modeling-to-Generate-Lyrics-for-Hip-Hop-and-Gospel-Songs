(Feat. Lil Wayne) 
 Lil' Wayne: 
 Uh, and mommy used to tell me one day some girl gone get me 
 Uh, but I won't know love if it walk right up and hit me 
 Uh, and if I fall to the ground I get up and fight another round 
 Girl, and I got money on my mind, money on my mind, but now... 
 I keep thinking of you, I keep, I keep thinking of you, I keep thinking of you 
 Girl, I keep thinking of you, I keep, I keep thinking of you, I keep thinking of you [x2] girll 
 And we ain't even gotta go far, we ain't gotta talk about the war, we can just (Get it [x7]) 
 I said we ain't even gotta go far, we ain't gotta talk about the war, we can just (Get it [x7]) 
 Tyga: 
 Damn I'm just thinking home 3 winner 
 Chriping late night, she had the light up antenna 
 Voices far from tenna 
 13 speaking like we 23 sometimes I would even miss dinner 
 Cause talking with you felt more impotant than Jordan's release when the 17's, remember? 
 I get em, simalar to any girl I've metion 
 They only thought I'd metion I'm only playing with your intuition 
 You seem to think that I was different 
 But too flashy for boyfriend material 
 But I beg to differ 
 [? ] Don't showin' you more material, 
 Now listen, let's Kiss, like Gene Simmons 
 I've got a vision, fuck a title, 
 We the perfect image, you and I 
 No eyein' them, them girls, you be eyein' 'em, 'cause they be eyein' him 
 They [? ] stonger than vitamins, 
 Lovin' you to death, I didn't expect 
 Beautiful girls, make you suicidal, 
 I guess I'm dyin' then... 
 Lil' Wayne: 
 Uh, up jump the boogie, and shorty said she feelin' my flavor 
 And even when I ain't lookin', I got her on my radar 
 And yes I know man I am so, so blessed to have her, 
 So yesterday, today, and the day after I keep thinkin' of you, 
 I keep thinkin' of youuu 
 I keep thinking of you, I keep, I keep thinking of you, I keep thinking of you 
 Girl, I keep thinking of you, I keep, I keep thinking of you, I keep thinking of you [x2] girll 
 Shorty said she feelin' my swag 
 Shorty said she feelin' my style
