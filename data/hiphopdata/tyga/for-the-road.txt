They say what goes around comes around 
 And I know I made mistakes and you forgave me how 
 I don't understand, you know I'm trying the best I can 
 I guess it's consequences when you dealing with sin 
 And even scarificed your friends over me 
 All them nights in the club turn to nights with me 
 It's like the same old story out your diary 
 Memories never fade but only in time we'll see 
 Hope to see you with me cause... 
 My heart beats for you, girl you know are the one 
 Are you mad at me, girl I know I made mistakes, I know I fucked up 
 But my heart beats for you baby I'mma go and scream it loud 
 But if you leave it's something I can't control 
 So let's do it one last time and fuck for the road 
 Grabbing and biting, remember the times after fighting 
 You said you loved me, I liked it, became obsessed with the sexing 
 You screaming "who's is it", we naked 
 Now I'm pullin your hair told you take it 
 A couple of shots, now we faded 
 Don't even know we made it, we home 
 Got that look in your eyes like hope you mine 
 Said you hoped the feeling's real 
 Really tired of all the lies 
 One minute we fine, then we not 
 Everything I do you can't but that's no reason for making mistakes 
 This time put it all on the plate 
 I, I told you be loyal, spoil you, never disown you 
 You get lonely when I'm touring just hold it down be supportive 
 I'll be back in the morning that new purse you wanted 
 What's good if you can't flaunt it (flaunt it), show it 
 Ain't the same, better than the rest 
 And what's real love if you ain't got respect? 
 And there's no way I can pay you back 
 But my plan is to make, make you understand 
 Make you understand that... 
 My heart beats for you, girl you know are the one 
 Are you mad at me, girl I know I made mistakes, I know I fucked up 
 But my heart beats for you baby I'mma go and scream it loud 
 But if you leave it's something I can't control 
 So let's do it one last time and fuck for the road 
 All I ever wanted was your happiness 
 But right now let's get right down to it, lets handle this business 
 If you gonna leave me tonight, I gotta kiss it goodbye 
 Girl I'm bout to make it cry, and all I need is one more time cause my... 
 Last time, best time, better than my next time 
 Rolex and vest time, Moët it's sex time 
 Hard to let go, a part of you gon' be alone 
 Scrolling your phone, looking at texts, seems like not too long ago 
 Ain't the same better than the rest 
 And what's real love if you ain't got respect? 
 And it's no way I can pay you back 
 But my plan is to make, make you understand 
 Make you understand that... 
 My heart beats for you, girl you know are the one 
 Are you mad at me, girl I know I made mistakes, I know I fucked up 
 But my heart beats for you baby I'mma go and scream it loud 
 But if you leave it's something I can't control 
 So let's do it one last time and fuck for the road
