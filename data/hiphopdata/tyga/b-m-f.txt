First of all I ain't feeling y'all 
 Feel the fucking heat defrost 
 Fill the spoon full of food 
 Ain't enough to feed the room 
 I don't have to goon, twizla boy split you to 
 Cherry red Rover roof 
 Crips to confuse you 
 You can say I blue's you 
 Better than I bruised you 
 All you niggas copycats doing shit I used to 
 Oh you tatted too, nigga fuck you 
 My bitch ain't got no tatts I hit her from the back 
 I spend south of France all that other shit is wack 
 Sling shot it in the ear than I let the shit collapse 
 Money is my pet peeve, give me hourly 
 If there is none at all, than I'm pissed off 
 I listen to Rick Ross and I know Ricky Ross 
 I'm Leonardo in Inception, reserve my section 
 I do dreams put you in a bubble, benz or Lexus 
 I Will Smith the necklace, I do it effortless 
 Bitch all eyes on me 
 The future's in my eyes, 
 [?] Bitches, bitches bring lies 
 One nigga jealous than the muthfucker dies 
 Figure you ain't scary if you did the crime 
 Now prepare it's dinnertime 
 Dimmer the lights, lemon with ice 
 Look it at twice it's fizzling sprite 
 Brown do the belly nice 
 No coca cola, I don't drink soda 
 Black beenie nigga, like a fucking smoker 
 They say I'm bout to blow up like super nova 
 Put your helmet on, the bulldozing dopest 
 How you shitting on 'em and ain't got shit on 'em 
 It killes me to know it, you Melanie Fiona 
 Oh, remove yourself from my scrotum 
 Oh, remove yourself, remove yourself 
 Oh, remove yourself from my scrotum 
 Pull your whole car I thought I told you.
