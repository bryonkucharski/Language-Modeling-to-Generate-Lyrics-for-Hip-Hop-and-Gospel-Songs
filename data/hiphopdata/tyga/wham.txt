I hit the bitch 
 I know you feel special 
 Look me in the eyes, I ain't ever lie 
 Real killa bees, Wu-Tang 'bout this West Side 
 Dominate, make a bitch woosah, head nod 
 Never been fake, gettin' pussy on the red dot 
 Red dots, pointin' at the bullseye 
 Lookin' at moi, it's a thin line 
 Got Bobby Brown for a widow, Superman high 
 Who gon' contest I? Light up the Jedi 
 Came with the booty and some caine, purple on the dank 
 Drippin' my new paint, days, 50 days 
 Yes I'll be late, I need dollars andale-le-le 
 Andale, all white, Lana Del Rey 
 Video games, fuckin', my life, gotta love it 
 Nothin' above it 
 Angels and Rolex, a ho fast in public 
 I don't shop at Publix 
 Pussy with chopsticks, I dug it, I dug it 
 I'm sober until 10 
 If she open, I lock it and post bail 
 I'ma need the helipad when I land 
 If it's not there, we back to the crib 
 That Maybach my limo 
 So you wanna bang, my nigga? 
 Got a piece that'll bang, my nigga 
 Let's bang, my nigga 
 When I finish, take all your bitches 
 Now she tellin' me all your business 
 I hit the bitch with the wham 
 Wham, wham 
 Pose like that, just like that 
 Just like that 
 That bitch give me wham 
 Wham, wham 
 Tattooed that, bring that shit 
 Pose like that 
 That bitch give me wham 
 Wham, fuck up the bed 
 Hole in her neck from the fangs 
 Pressure and pain, adjust the brains 
 Rove to the Lamb', my engine the same 
 Asylum restrained, this ain't for playin' 
 Put on the mask, now I'm Zoro on the dash 
 They don't make 'em like this anymore, goddamn 
 I'm pullin' up, you would think my first name Dan 
 Niggas like damn, load up the pain, no blanks 
 Got hate, do a stain, pallbearer liftin' dead weight 
 How much you weigh? 
 On a scale... to 98 
 Keep it one hundred with me like sand on the beach 
 Need a freak of the week 
 That's her sister Anise, keep it G 
 On some real shit, niggas can't fuck with me 
 They can't fuck with me 
 Wham, wham, more than a man 
 Who got the keys to the Lamb' 
 Pussy and cash, hundreds and ass 
 Pulled out my stash, niggas got mad 
 Mad, damn, drunk when I land 
 Fresh off the plan, T-Raw the ram 
 Look me in the eyes, I ain't ever lie 
 I hit the bitch with the wham 
 Wham, wham 
 Pose like that, just like that 
 Just like that 
 That bitch give me wham 
 Wham, wham 
 Tattooed that, bring that shit 
 Pose like that 
 That bitch give me wham 
 Wham, wham 
 Pose like that, just like that 
 Just like that 
 That bitch give me wham 
 Wham, wham 
 Tattooed that, bring that shit 
 Pose like that 
 That bitch give me wham 
 (Wham) 
 You now listenin' to the sounds of T-Y-G, if you don't like what you hear, sit back and shut the fuck up. Oh yeah, and have a nice day
