 Shining hard every second don't blink ho 
 If you ain't sipping and you tripping better drink more 
 Too many dicks on the field trying to get yours

 All my homies in this thing wish a nigga would 
 If a nigga could, I don't think he should 
 Getting money, rocking clubs like T Woods 
 Bright lights like we living in the sky

 Yeah, it ain't tricking nigga got it 
 But we ain't tricking anything and we got it, so
