 Tyga, Wop, argh 
 Ooh, BatGang on the track, bitch 
 Tyga and Gucci Mane 
 Baby, when I sip a lil, I miss you a lil 
 Baby, when I sip a lil more, I miss you a lil more (Wop) 
 Baby, when I sip a lil, I miss you a lil 
 Baby, when I sip a lil more, I miss you a lil more 
 Tyga 
 Baby, when the lights are low and the night is warm 
 You like it slow, I used to rush to you 
 Baby, when the rain pours down 
 Reminds me of touchin' you 
 Baby, when I'm out and the pill hit 
 I start to feel shit, shit I used to feel when you still here 
 Sometimes I roll over like you still there 
 I been rollin' for a week and I'm still lit 
 Got a baby for my body high, baby for my head high 
 Got a lil baby for my bedtime 
 Got a lil baby come through in the AM for the cereal 
 My boutique lil baby got more poochie than a milli though 
 No, no, I don't think they feel me though 
 Lookin' in the mirror, I'm a miracle 
 You know when I sip a lil, I might send a missile 
 Hit you with that tongue emoji, wanna lick that 
 I be on a mission, yeah, I know you see the vision, yeah 
 Still wanna see me, got me feelin' like I need you when 
 Tyga and Gucci Mane 
 When I sip a lil, I miss you a lil 
 Baby, when I sip a lil more, I miss you a lil more (Wop) 
 Baby, when I sip a lil, I miss you a lil 
 Baby, when I sip a lil more, I miss you a lil more (go, go, go) 
 Baby, when the lights are low and the night is warm 
 You like it slow, I used to rush to you 
 Baby, when the rain pours down 
 Reminds me of touchin' you (Wop) 
 Gucci Mane 
 She just wants some closure, my thing out is suicidal 
 I bet she hear this song and think of Guwop inside her 
 Drop top with my top open, her heart broken, I'm liable 
 My ambition as a rider, is all about survival 
 Glacier blue McLaren and I drive it like MacGyver 
 Got so many Burkin bags, that bitch can't make her mind up 
 I'm the owner but I'm coach and play, I just might change the line up 
 Too bad he wanna be with Gucci gang, I won't let him sign up 
 Bigger, bigger diamonds got 'em lost in the sauce 
 Yeah, you crossed the line like the stones in the cross 
 I was on the boss, now I'm boss of the boss 
 And I just crack a smile 'cause you done, stick a fork 
 Tyga and Gucci Mane 
 Baby, when I sip a lil, I miss you a lil (Gucci) 
 Baby, when I sip a lil more, I miss you a lil more 
 Baby, when I sip a lil, I miss you a lil 
 Baby, when I sip a lil more, I miss you a lil more 
 Tyga 
 And the vibe don't lie, I hear what you sayin' 
 But the vide don't lie, I'm where you wanna be layin' at 
 Who you playin' with? I'm not a toy thing 
 I'm a man, I'm not your boyfriend, I boost off the poison 
 Sip a lil, mix a lil, twist a lil, kiss a lil 
 We lick a lil, just a lil but this ain't lil (this ain't lil) 
 I was tryna call you 
 All summer, tryna fall through, I hit you like where are you? 
 When I sip a lil, I miss you a lil (Gucci) 
 Baby, when I sip a lil more, I miss you a lil more 
 Baby, when I sip a lil, I miss you a lil 
 Baby, when I sip a lil more, I miss you a lil more
