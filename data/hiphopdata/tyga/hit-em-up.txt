I said fuck them other niggas, 'cause I'm down for my niggas 
 Fuck them other niggas, 'cause I'm down for my niggas 
 Fuck them other niggas, I ride for my niggas 
 I die for my niggas, nigga I hit 'em up 
 T Raww go stay Westside, killa cat pillar, 
 No ceiling, probably worth 10 million 
 Poor nigga watch chilla, you ain't even gotta feel it 
 That's chin chinchilla flyer than a caterpillar 
 I sick my dogs at you, yeah 
 Then call the dog catcher, bitch 
 Spark the fire, no matches, yeah 
 So high just laughing, hah 
 Burners in the attic, they ain't know I had it 
 Shoot sporadic, fire automatic, pop the target 
 Driving backwards, I'm a hundred bill fanatic 
 Bring the static, make vows to the money, but I skipped marriage 
 Keep staring, rather die that nigga than live average, get you embarrassed 
 Thousand karats on my wheel let my kids inherit 
 Black card credit, told them I don't use debit 
 Nigga know that's my motto, I could do this shit forever so 
 Fuck them other niggas, 'cause I'm down for my niggas 
 Fuck them other niggas, 'cause I'm down for my niggas 
 Fuck them other niggas, I ride for my niggas 
 I die for my niggas, talkin' get you hit up 
 Fuck them other niggas, 'cause I'm down for my niggas 
 Fuck them other niggas, 'cause I'm down for my niggas 
 Fuck them other niggas, I ride for my niggas 
 I die for my niggas, nigga I hit 'em up 
 We don't rock with them niggas anyway, fuck them 
 We'd ever caught them in the hood, we'd a stuck them 
 Things coming in, we get them off by the dozen 
 We about that action, you ain't about nothin' 
 Girl of your dream, I already had her 
 If it ain't my team, it don't really matter 
 Short stay, I'm only in town for the figures 
 Even when I'm up, I'm still down for my niggas 
 Need nothing else, don't concern me or worry me 
 Nah, I'mma ride till they burn me or bury me 
 Cause the truth is, niggas die every day 
 Heard about me, I hope you heard thoroughly 
 I don't switch sides, I just switch rides 
 Might just get a little head, let the bitch slide 
 Knowing that I can, knowing that I will 
 Far as the other side go, you know how I feel 
 Fuck them other niggas, 'cause I'm down for my niggas 
 Fuck them other niggas, 'cause I'm down for my niggas 
 Fuck them other niggas, I ride for my niggas 
 I die for my niggas, talkin' get you hit up 
 Fuck them other niggas, 'cause I'm down for my niggas 
 Fuck them other niggas, 'cause I'm down for my niggas 
 Fuck them other niggas, I ride for my niggas 
 I die for my niggas, nigga I hit 'em up 
 You gotta watch your back 
 Stay strapped, be alert 
 Started as a young motherfucker doin' dirt 
 Walkin' through the streets wearin' jewels 
 Ain't got shit to lose 
 Gonna fuck up and bust young niggas with tools 
 The intricate designs of my lethal lines 
 Now time hard to find a job, easier to rob niggas 
 These days, motherfuckers talk shit 
 And turn snitch when you see 'em 
 They ain't talkin' 'bout shit 
 Westside 
 I keep a vest on my chest 
 Buck, buck, cops wanna hit me with the book 
 But I don't give a fuck 
 Government got a nigga feelin' stuck 
 While these same little sluts gettin' fucked 
 For a quick buck 
 Weed make my mind roam 
 All alone, ain't nothin' like tryin' to bone 
 Over the phone, in my mind I can see her naked 
 I can't take it 
 Got me shakin' at the thought that we can make it 
 I thought you knew 
 Get loaded, can't control it 
 Nigga, pass me the blunt and let me roll it 
 Then smoke it, sippin 
 Hennessy 
 Plottin' on my enemies 
 'Comin' back twice as hard 
 Like, remember me 
 My hustle to my dyin' days 
 Niggas dyin' every day 
 And we celebrate with pain 
 Pourin' champagne 
 Drink politics, they wanna join my campaign 
 Worldwide, LA niggas screaming 
 Westside 
 Fuck them other niggas, 'cause I'm down for my niggas 
 Fuck them other niggas, 'cause I'm down for my niggas 
 Fuck them other niggas, I ride for my niggas 
 I die for my niggas, talkin' get you hit up 
 Fuck them other niggas, 'cause I'm down for my niggas 
 Fuck them other niggas, 'cause I'm down for my niggas 
 Fuck them other niggas, I ride for my niggas 
 I die for my niggas, nigga I hit 'em up
