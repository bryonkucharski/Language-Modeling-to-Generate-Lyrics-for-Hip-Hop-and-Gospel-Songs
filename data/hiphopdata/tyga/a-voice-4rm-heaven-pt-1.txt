I pray to God every night. 
 I still do that 
 I just wanted, I wanted God to know that even tho I was going through the worst of times I still recognize him as being something greater than myself 
 And that I'm not gonna give up my faith just because it's going bad for me 
 'Cause he was there when I was living good, so I just want him to know that, you know that I'm not no punk, and I'm not soft hearted. 
 That when it gets bad I'm gonna be like oh I don't believe in God no more 
 I believe in God all the time, everyday, all day, good and bad, rough and hard, 5 shots, jail time, everything 
 Good times, million dollars, benzs, all that, I always believe in God because he gave it all to me
