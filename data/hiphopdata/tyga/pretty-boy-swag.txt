This right here 
 I'ma bout to re-kill 
 Cack it into yo ear 
 Resurrect and disappear 
 B-tch I'm bigger, you small 
 I be clowin' calls 
 And your just a funny guy, little duval 
 B-tch I'm a beast, man, dog 
 Licking the blood up off my paws 
 Filling my cup up, silly straw 
 7-11 slirp me off 
 Put her beaver on my log 
 Then she lick lick like a frog 
 Pretty boy I'm not at all 
 I'm just way fresher than y'all 
 N-gga damn, always talkin' to b-tches not my age 
 Yeah I'm young, you old, so put these babies on yo face 
 Tender love baby face 
 Say she want it everyday, but once I hit it it ain't the same 
 Ash-ley Mary Kay, haha 
 Oh sh-t full house it's a pool party 
 Heres the address use Google mami 
 Smell the herb, mess 
 Its goo gaary 
 Treat my b-tches like they sisters 
 Now you work for me 
 Spazz man 
 All about gettin' my cash fast 
 I'm totally rad, show her my tats 
 Flippin the bird, turnin' my back 
 No love, my heart will be back 
 Barry your tongue in my lap 
 I ain't even write sh-t after that 
 Okay look up b-tch I'm flexin 
 Penthouse level leave you naked 
 Eat your heart out b-tch I'm Jeffrey 
 Damme darrier my luggage 
 Lucky lefty I'm right handed 
 I'm crazy I'm just sayin' 
 Nickles, dimes, quarters, grams 
 I don't smoke just patron 
 Roll the L while we here 
 Plus the plane leaving in ten 
 I got models I got friends 
 But I never spend on them 
 Only circle that I'm in, is the circle of success 
 F-ck stress, have sex 
 And I do that sh-t the best, aww
