Almost EST. in the 90's 
 But I'm still a 80's baby 
 Don't even try is the way God made me 
 Uh uh, its's the way GOD made me (2x) 
 Hey hater man, you lookin' down on a greater man 
 'Kuz with cheese I'm grating quicker, and G's don't stand for gangsta grip 
 It means more than what ya averaging 
 I probably average more ice then Alaska's skin 
 Think fast 'kuz the jab is quick, 24 hours my star power 100% 
 My tolerance like 'enuff of this 
 Who is this kid think he is? 
 Notorious like I'm close to big 
 You ain't notice that my focus like pac I'm above the rim, but more potent than that whole script 
 I've written' most of my career since 12 
 Did I mention it 5 year later I be rich from it? 
 Now lets timeline '89- where everyone was supafly, kingpin or the nearest guy 
 I was compton hospitalized, in the streets another victim but different in my mother eyes 
 Wait, don't cut the chimes 
 I need more relief than 357 mili G's, gotta cold flow I need a pharamacy 
 Honestly, I am one of the youngest old souls on the scene 
 If agreed than future teens vote for me 
 This election, make my selection, by the most lyrically 
 Holding grudes was never me, my budget won't allow the beef 
 Don't act your age act your salary 
 They hatin' me and the horse I rode in on 
 But have they ever seen they name explode in Neon's 
 No 
 You wasn't talkin' 'bout me, must've been talkin' ;bout that pony 
 'Kuz they say Tyga so great like Tony 
 Frosted Flakes in the roley, oh he started off with the ice motion 
 Before the deat I had a gliss like wrist and mo shit 
 The only true story, VIP's Lil' Homey 
 Step in and get to know me 
 Almost EST. in the 90's 
 But I'm still a 80's baby 
 Don't even try is the way God made me 
 Uh uh, its's the way GOD made me (4x)
