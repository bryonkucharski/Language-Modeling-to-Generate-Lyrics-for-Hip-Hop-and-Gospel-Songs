 It's so hard to not pick up the phone, bang your line one time and ask 'bout your day 
 It's so hard to look the other way 
 Tell me something that will push me away 
 Tell me something that will push me away 
 I took something for the pain, it never took it away, nah 
 It's only two and I took two today, already took two today 
 But the truth is I never wanted you to stay 
 But you do what you want, yeah and I wanted it that way 
 Pushin' through the city in my four by four, by two 
 Yeah, barely fitted through the drive-through, wanna slide by you 
 So hard not to tell you he a sucker 
 So hard to see you suffer, let you see for yourself 
 Yeah, it's hard for me to trust ya 
 But I know this bust down Patek won't switch sides, yeah 
 I know this Lambo won't switch sides, yeah 
 I know my true fans won't switch sides 
 If I give my new bitch just a lil time, she'll be big time 
 And it'll so hard to look the other way 
 But it's so hard to not pick up the phone, bang your line one time and ask 'bout your day 
 It's so hard to look the other way 
 Tell me something that will push me away 
 Tell me something that will push me away 
 I took something for the pain, yeah 
 But it's still so hard to look the other way 
 So hard to not pick up the phone, bang your line one time and ask 'bout your day, yeah 
 So hard to look the other way 
 Tell me something that will push me away

 Don't have to check the 'Gram to know your move 
 Yeah, I need a Khaled, gon' pop me another one 
 I need a Khaled, gon' find me another one (another one) 
 Gon' buy me another one, you could lie to the other one 
 Say something that will push me away 
 You brought out the beast, I can't put it away 
 Yeah, truth is I wanted you to stay 
 But the door's tryna close and my foot's in the way 
 Push me away, tell 'em I was unconditional 
 Tell 'em how I strengthened your spiritual 
 Tell 'em I know you like I invented you 
 That's why it's so hard to look the other way 
 It's so hard to not pick up the phone, bang your line one time and ask 'bout your day 
 So hard to look the other way 
 Tell me something that will push me away 
 Tell me something that will push me away 
 I took something for the pain, it never took it away, nah, nah
