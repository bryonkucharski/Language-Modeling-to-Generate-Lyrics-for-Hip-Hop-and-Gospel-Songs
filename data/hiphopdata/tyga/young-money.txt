Ha! 
 Tyga, 
 One verse wouldn't hurt., 
 Pharell said fuck ya' niggas, 
 Ha ha ha, shame on you bitch, 
 Let the streets know, 
 Let the streets know. 
 [Verse 1] Tyga 
 Who the hottest niggas out boy, young money 
 We could buy you niggas out if we really wanted 
 Car transformin, the grill george foreman 
 What I paid for was your house plus mortgage 
 Rap borin' and you niggas ain't even tourin' 
 I just bought a fly bitch now that bitch tourin 
 My swag soarin sharper than source award wards is 
 Award me best horror Tyga monster 
 Willy wonk ya welcome to my chocolate fuckers 
 Cherry pop em' like bubble wrap in the boxes 
 That girl boppa be tweetin all the homies watch her 
 Binoculars the only way you gone see me partner 
 My life is awsome I'm on so you know she off one 
 I'm in zone home girl stop cock blockin' 
 Bitch roosters on my watch rubies tick tockin' 
 Young money goblins we are a fuckin' problem 
 [Hook] Tyga 
 Bitch I'm young money, Bitch I'm young money, 
 Bitch I'm young money, Bitch I'm young money, 
 Bitch I'm young money, Bitch I'm young money, 
 Bitch I'm young money, Bitch I'm young money, 
 Bitch I'm young money, Bitch I'm young,
