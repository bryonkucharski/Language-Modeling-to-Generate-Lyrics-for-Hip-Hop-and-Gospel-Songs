I'm the fuckin' man, you don't get it do ya? 
 Type of money everybody acting like they knew ya 
 Go uptown, New York City bitch 
 Some Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura 
 Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami too 
 Clubbing hard, fuckin' women ain't much to do 
 Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne 
 Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed 
 How you feel? How you feel? How you feel? 
 Twenty five sittin' on twenty-five mil uh 
 I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself 
 Rest in peace Mac Dre, I'mma do it for the Bay, okay 
 Getting paid well holla wen ever that stop 
 My team good, we don't really need a mascot 
 Tell Tune "light one, pass it like a relay" 
 YMCMB you niggas more YMCA 
 Me, Freddie, Marley Marl at the cribbo 
 Shout goes out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shout to Gibbo 
 We got Santa Margarita by the liter 
 She know even if I'm fuckin' with her, I don't really need her 
 Ah, That's how you feel man? 
 That's really how you feel? 
 Cause the pimpin' ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill 
 I mean maybe she won't 
 Then again maybe she will 
 I can almost guarantee she know the deal 
 Real nigga wassap 
 Now she want a photo Ya 
 You already know though 
 You only live once, that's the motto nigga YOLO 
 We 'bout it every day, every day, every day 
 Like we sittin' on the bench, nigga we don't really play 
 Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say 
 Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way 
 Real nigga wassup? 
 One, time fuck one time 
 I'm calling niggas out like the umpire 
 Seven, grams in the blunt 
 Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt 
 It's Eastside, we in this bitch 
 Wish a nigga would like a tree in this bitch 
 And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch 
 That's my MO add a B to that shit 
 I'm fucked up, torn down 
 I'm twisted: door knob 
 Talk stupid, off with your head! 
 Nigga money talks and Mr Ed! Ya 
 I'm so Young Money got a drum on the gun 
 Energizer bunny 
 Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar 
 Ain't shit sweet niggas on the street like hookers 
 I tongue kiss her other tongue 
 Skeet skeet skeet: water gun 
 Oh my God Becky look at her butt 
 Tunechi 
 Wassap wassap 
 Real nigga wassup 
 Real nigga wassup 
 Wassap, wassap
