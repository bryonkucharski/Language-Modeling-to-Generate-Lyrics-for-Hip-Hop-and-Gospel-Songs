 Kill a nigga, last king roll up on 'em in a Bentley 
 Mothaf-cka, gorilla, go getter, ho getter 
 Ho nigga better hold your nigga

 Ladies' man, baby I know what them bitches like 
 Little Mike, Mike and Ike

 Fur murder swervin' make the jet ski do a hurdle 
 Yous a muthafucking turtle, knock you down like Berto 
 Straps on my sides like Urkle, boy I'll hurt you
