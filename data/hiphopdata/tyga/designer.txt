 Snakeskin, D.R., that was last spring 
 Niggas blogging now 'cause I got that gold thing 
 Make these bitches scream, makes these pussies pop 
 Killing niggas for no reason, Trayvon 
 This that Zimmerman, that drop head, they photoshop 
 That real shit, my niggas 'bout, your flaws out, I floss it out 
 My dick hard, it's in your broad, I swear to God, I pulled it out 
 My squirt Game, on her face 
 I dick slap her, now I'm Dick Tracy 
 Pea coat, c-notes, niggas talking 'bout G's, though 
 Honey cocaine took one for the team though 
 That's real shit, I love her to death 
 I fuck a bitch until she ain't wet 
 Destroy your life with one check 
 Just made another million dollars, nigga, what's next?
