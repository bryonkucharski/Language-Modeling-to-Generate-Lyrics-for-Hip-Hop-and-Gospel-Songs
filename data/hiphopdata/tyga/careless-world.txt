I awoke from a dream 
 Filled of a world full of greed and hate 
 The world was my thoughts, and surroundings 
 I realized I needed to rise... and become king 
 My own destiny 
 Take a look around, tears from they eyes 
 Knees on the ground, money in the sky 
 Take a look around, ain't shit nice? 
 Praying for my life, hope I make it through the night 
 Take a look around, the city on fire 
 It's all taking place in the middle of my mind 
 I stand in the middle, cause death right beside 
 Murdering is simple, get your life simplified 
 Where the bones lie, rebuild another life 
 America's pie, put my hand in the pot 
 I can't get caught in the streets I was taught 
 Raised off anger, but it wasn't my fault 
 Nigga, take a look around, it's needles on the ground 
 Never gave three fucks, and I still don't now 
 I'm fuckin' in the house, babysitter on the couch 
 Thirteen like, "What this shit comin' out?" 
 Pass me a jimmy, I ain't ready for a child 
 I hope nobody hears "bitch, why you so loud?" 
 Turn on the tube, put my head on the cloud 
 Breathe, inhale, the angels can't help 
 Tyga, take a look around 
 Take a look around 
 Take a look around, tears from they eyes 
 Knees on the ground, money in the sky 
 Take a look around, ain't shit nice? 
 Praying for my life, hope I make it through the night 
 Take a look around 
 Take a look around 
 (Take a look around) 
 All night, fighting 'em for my life 
 Praying that everything gon' be right 
 (Take a look around) 
 Ain't it nice, truth over the lies? 
 Young Knights, we kings in the skies 
 (Take a look around) 
 I ride around in my city 
 Bitches pictures up in they titties 
 Man, you fake, all of us know it 
 I'm original and I show it 
 Roll one time for everyone down and 
 T-two times for the nigga that bounce 
 Then why you sitting round that couch shit 
 My money building, like houses 
 Feeling like you wise 
 Truth be told, it's all lies 
 These the days of our lives 
 Why you wasting all of your time? 
 Voices from the skies 
 Said that evil fall in yo rise 
 They judge me low to the dirt 
 Then they celebrate to my highs 
 Why you, why you wanna be fake, I fucking hate you 
 Why you made 'cause I ain't take you? 
 Last day alive, I wouldn't even date you 
 "I'll replace you with somebody better" that you only make up 
 We just make up, wake up king and queen and rule the world a little later 
 Later on in that day, tears all in her face 
 I said I'm going away 
 She begging me to stay 
 Took a look in her eyes, then she put my hands on her waist 
 Said, "Don't leave, we've got a baby on the way" 
 (Take a look around) 
 All night, fighting 'em for my life 
 Praying that everything gon' be right 
 (Take a look around) 
 Ain't it nice, truth over the lies? 
 Young Knights, we kings in the skies 
 (Take a look around) 
 I ride around in my city 
 Bitches pictures up in they titties 
 Man, you fake, all of us know it 
 I'm original and I show it 
 (Take a look around) 
 I ride around in my city 
 Bitches pictures up in they titties 
 Man, you fake, all of us know it 
 I'm original and I show it 
 (Take a look around) 
 (Outro: Martin Luther King Jr.) 
 I want you to know tonight 
 That we, as a people, will get to the promised land 
 And I'm not worried about anything, I'm not fearing any man 
 My eyes have seen the glory, of the coming of the Lord
