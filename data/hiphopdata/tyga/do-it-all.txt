Looking at the ceiling thinking why I treat you bad 
 Ain't no worser feelings than knowing I did it for the last 
 Arguing, all I was doing accusing you, my bad 
 Said "Let's take some time", nevermind, rewind 
 Looking at the ceiling thinking why I treat you bad 
 Ain't no worser feelings than knowing I did it for the last 
 Arguing, all I was doing accusing you, my bad 
 Said "Let's take some time", nevermind, just playing with your mind 
 I always thought "play dumb", and let the other one love 
 Why? Get caught up in nowhere but trust 
 Only love for fun, I'm too young, I thought 
 All I wanted was a thanks to Louboutins I bought 
 But it ain't your fault; heaven knows you deserve it all 
 You sent letters to my heart, but I burned them all 
 The Bible says before you run, gotta learn to crawl 
 But I don't wanna waste time if we ain't involved 
 Oh oh 
 We been through it all 
 I know I broke your heart once before 
 But I'm done 
 Oh oh oh 
 Tell me what's wrong 
 I know I never listen but just listen to this song 
 Oh man 
 I promise we gon' do it till the sun come down 
 I swear it's going down 
 I promise we gon' do it till the sun come up 
 Fuck it they don't do it, we gon' do it all 
 Now the ceiling fan spinning getting dizzy man 
 Wondering who she with maybe should I call - don't be desperate man 
 This ain't no "tag, you're it" hide and seek shit 
 Reality just kicked in, I lost one and now she's winning 
 Found another nigga she dig 
 Says he treat her like a queen but she probably control him 
 Fuck that, I gotta get her back to what we started 
 Start over again this time my heart's seeing honest- 
 Le-leave us, leave us let's just talk about it 
 I know before I wasn't much of a man about it 
 But this time I realize I can't live without you 
 Believe when I say it's true I love you 
 Oh oh 
 We been through it all 
 I know I broke your heart once before 
 But I'm done 
 Oh oh oh 
 Tell me what's wrong 
 I know I never listen but just listen to this song 
 Oh man 
 I promise we gon' do it till the sun come down 
 I swear it's going down 
 I promise we gon' do it till the sun come up 
 Fuck it they don't do it, we gon' do it all 
 Love make you do it all 
 Going up and down like a seesaw 
 Can't be a player forever dog 
 It feels so good but I know it's wrong 
 Motherfucker drink what I'm sipping on 
 Motherfucker drink what I'm sipping on 
 Motherfucker drink what I'm sipping on 
 A bottle of love tell me if it's too strong 
 Oh oh 
 We been through it all 
 I know I broke your heart once before 
 But I'm done 
 Oh oh oh 
 Tell me what's wrong 
 I know I never listen but just listen to this song 
 Oh man 
 I promise we gon' do it till the sun come down 
 I swear it's going down 
 I promise we gon' do it till the sun come up 
 Fuck it they don't do it, we gon' do it all
