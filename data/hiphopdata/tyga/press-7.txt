(1st Verse) 
 First off let me clear my chest 
 Started off on baby steps 
 We get right to the moment where babys come next 
 Grab tight holdin' our self to what's nothin' left 
 Two choices I'm ya boyfriend or lets just forget 
 After dat you plead like I can't believe what we did 
 So only option was to agree and keep it secret 
 Or ya friends will make ya think that ya just another cheerleader 
 On his team, Tyga man a playa 
 See but, don't believe what ears can hear and eyes can not see 
 You seeing me on a daily baby 
 Where's my time for another lady? 
 Get over it, trust me, faithfully, I can be all that you need 
 Say you want to let me go and 
 That's gonna have to end 
 You can Go and getta new boyfriend 
 But you'll never getta better boyfriend 
 Love just ain't our way but, 
 You know I don't pretend 
 Imma go and getta new girlfriend 
 Imma get myself a better girlfriend 
 (2nd Verse) 
 (Girl Talks on Answering Machine) 
 Dear Ma, 
 Misses She left ya guard down 
 For girbuads and riches 
 So we tore the mall down 
 And therefore fulfilled your little wishes 
 No more penny, pigeon, chowing at places 
 Dinner to reservations 
 I'm so on to this lifestyle 
 I put you on to it baby, Tyga Style 
 Just don't run from it 'cause there's carpets every where we roam now 
 Profits for party poppin' wit popular crowds 
 Getty images flickering, Perez Hilton 
 Liker her dress was ridiculous, complements of Tygas dispense 
 I come at dem like Pete Wentz 
 Don't worry it's all coming back in the end 
 Say you want to let me go and 
 That's gonna have to end 
 You can Go and getta new boyfriend 
 But you'll never getta better boyfriend 
 Love just ain't our way but, 
 You know I don't pretend 
 Imma go and getta new girlfriend 
 Imma get myself a better girlfriend 
 (3rd Verse) 
 Wait, so this is how we plan it 
 Benifit friends and relationships don't mix 
 But don't trip, 'cause you I'm far over with 
 Long John Silver sick 
 And this boat no longer floats for you goldfish 
 Go dig another ditch 'cause I'm dead done wit dis 
 I'm hangin' up now, My new girl she's in the front now 
 I know that gotta hurt 
 Time to answer her 
 Well I guess its true 
 Stick to the player rules 
 Say you want to let me go and 
 That's gonna have to end 
 You can Go and getta new boyfriend 
 But you'll never getta better boyfriend 
 Love just ain't our way but, 
 You know I don't pretend 
 Imma go and getta new girlfriend 
 Imma get myself a better girlfriend
