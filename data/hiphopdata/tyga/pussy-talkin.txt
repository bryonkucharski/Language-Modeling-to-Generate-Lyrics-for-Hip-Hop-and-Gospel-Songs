Pussy talkin' like... 
 Pussy talkin' like... 
 Well done 
 Aye babe, why you puttin' us on display 
 Bringing up old shit in front of all our friends 
 And trying to start to day with arguments 
 Trying to relax like parliaments 
 We doing the opposite 
 Textin' keshia like man I think this nigga be cheatin' 
 I'm late working 
 I know I didn't come home that evening 
 Calling my phone, 
 Attitudes, heavy breathing 
 I mean what's the reason 
 Or is it that your menstrual speakin' hah 
 I ain't gamin' just tired of fakin' 
 No patience be a rider like alizé 
 Thomas Clay Aiken no gay shit 
 Ass naked, commando baby 
 She got my dick motivated 
 Now we wakin' up middle of the night 
 Fuckin' make up right after we fight 
 Pussy talkin' like... 
 Well done 
 Pussy talkin' like... 
 Well done 
 Man she always wakin' up middle of the night 
 Fuckin' make up right after we fight 
 Pussy talkin' like... 
 Well done 
 That pussy talkin' like... 
 Well done 
 Uh lay it down bend it over like strippers open 
 Water gun big shoot you 
 Now you super soakin' 
 Comin' down your chimmey 
 Call it santa workin' 
 I brought some gifts for you 
 Mango flavored lotion 
 Wetter then a loofah 
 Lube you on your momma's sofa 
 Stretch it out rosa acosta 
 I do this shit have you comin' over and over 
 Again like a maid service clean her perfect 
 I ain't perfect 
 Most of them bitches don't deserve me 
 Had my moments but most them bitches all be thirsty 
 They ain't worth it 
 Block 'em all like stage curtains 
 Knock 'em off like fake purses 
 I ain't trickin' but you got it 
 Loving you being honest 
 Hard to be honest but most of the time you indecisive 
 I'm tired of fighting 
 Let it go close your eye lids 
 Open the morning fresh and we vibin' 
 Now we wakin' up middle of the night 
 Fuckin' make up right after we fight 
 Pussy talkin' like... 
 Well done 
 Pussy talkin' like... 
 Well done 
 Man she always wakin' up middle of the night 
 Fuckin' make up right after we fight 
 Pussy talkin' like... 
 Well done 
 That pussy talkin' like... 
 Well done 
 Finish him!
