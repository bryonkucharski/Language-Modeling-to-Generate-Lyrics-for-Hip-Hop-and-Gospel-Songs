Why do we fight 
 Why do argue you 
 All through night 
 When we should be pillow talking baby 
 Make the wrongs 
 All things aside 
 Swallow our pride 
 And just love each other all the time 
 You got me and I got you 
 What else could really matter 
 But lovin' that's 
 What it's all about 
 Till death does us part 
 Dear princess remember 
 What I called you 
 Markin those calendar days away till that moment I saw you 
 And I fell in love 
 From that very moment I saw you 
 Glad I 
 Played on the phone and dialed them numbers to call you 
 And now I'm thinkin' about how 
 That could go wrong 
 You was so special to me like the music in this song 
 From my heart 
 I said till death 
 Do us apart 
 Within 
 Dated for only a month 
 Or so 
 How is this possible 
 She she got me stutterin 
 My words beginning to slur 
 As I say 
 I love her 
 But I'm lovin' it 
 It feels so right 
 When I'm 
 Huggin her 
 She sayin' the same 
 She feelin' complete like 
 Two way streets 
 Ringin' my phone she never hear a beat 
 That means 
 I'm answering 
 Fulfillin her every need and desire 
 Ya dream 
 This is life with me 
 Continuous shoppin' sprees 
 When I'm on the road 
 Even gave you all the security code 
 So baby 
 Tell me tell me 
 Why do we fight 
 Why do argue you 
 All through night 
 When we should be pillow talking baby 
 Make the wrongs 
 All things aside 
 Swallow our pride 
 And just love each other all the time 
 You got me and I got you 
 What else could really matter 
 But lovin' that's 
 What it's all about 
 Till death does us part 
 I got more to stay to you 
 I thought I was more to what we had 
 Her secret stash 
 Filled with bundles of emotions 
 Now I'm startin to notice 
 All that shit was bogus 
 All the dozens of roses 
 Thinkin' you was my golden token 
 Now I'm feelin' frozen 
 Lookin' like my life is hopeless 
 No human 
 Should ever experience 
 What I drove in 
 Now my car is broken 
 My engine hood 
 I should have never left it opened 
 Lookin' like I'm on E 
 No fuel I can't even eat 
 Don't even want to breath if you ain't close to me 
 No friends 
 My only enemy is cupid 
 How could you be so stupid 
 Please tell me why love hurts 
 Can you even hear me 
 Can you even imagine 
 If your arrow wasn't workin for weeks 
 I don't 
 Think so 
 I'm just tryin' 
 To think slow 
 It just ain't me 
 So please play the drum rolls 
 And roll the red carpets out 
 As I wait for you to return 
 With an explanation 
 So baby start explaining 
 Why do we fight 
 Why do argue you 
 All through night 
 When we should be pillow talking baby 
 Make the wrongs 
 All things aside 
 Swallow our pride 
 And just love each other all the time 
 You got me and I got you 
 What else could really matter 
 But lovin' that's 
 What it's all about 
 Till death does us part
