The days go by, we argue all the time 
 I want to make it right 'cause that was last night 
 Baby, we gon' be all right, baby, we gon' be all right 
 Yeah, yeah, love was the mark, bullets to your heart 
 I want to move on but my feelings too strong 
 I don't wanna waste time, I don't wanna waste time 
 Man, I know we ain't finished when it's barely beginning 
 All the time I done put in, I put in but time was ending 
 So silly chasing a feeling, figured you felt different 
 But so many, so many girls but I just stay with ya 
 See love wasn't my intention, rather play Dominoes 
 Count money with my niggas, shoot dice 
 Give me seven, rolling off the gate, I hit it twice 
 Black Eyed Peas, money baby, it's gon' be a good night 
 And when I said I love you I fucking meant it 
 And we ain't gotta bring your moms and your sister in it 
 House too big, they all trying to spend the night 
 You always inviting them and I don't need to be liking it 
 At all, and I don't need to say shit 
 'Cause I just like to see you happy even when you faking it 
 So flagrant you foul ass bitch, man, I hate you 
 I hope we can make up in the A.M. 
 'Cause the days go by, we argue all the time 
 I want to make it right 'cause that was last night 
 Baby, we gon' be all right, baby, we gon' be all right 
 Yeah, yeah, love was the mark, bullets to your heart 
 I want to move on but my feelings too strong 
 I don't wanna waste time, I don't wanna waste time 
 It's like we're in a love game, love game, love game, love game 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 It's like we're in a love game, love game, love game, love game 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Uh, for every last king need a queen 
 If you love me now then forever hold this ring 
 Hold me down, defend it, hold me down, no witness 
 You always got so much pride but once you look in my eyes 
 It's over, you even told me about you when you was younger 
 How your father abused you, I let you cry on my shoulder 
 No tissue, just short sleeve, tears see-through 
 Our lives equal, thinking what you been through 
 Uh, yo genie here, yeah, I grant you every wish 
 Put you in environments, good company success 
 Already set, you going with the best 
 I know I lied before but trust me I ain't like your ex 
 Sex so good, break up then break a sweat 
 We should stay together, then we fight again 
 Same old shit, different location 
 Feeling like my time wasted 
 'Cause the days go by, we argue all the time 
 I want to make it right 'cause that was last night 
 Baby, we gon' be all right, baby, we gon' be all right 
 Yeah, yeah, love was the mark, bullets to your heart 
 I want to move on but my feelings too strong 
 I don't wanna waste time, I don't wanna waste time 
 It's like we're in a love game, love game, love game, love game 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 It's like we're in a love game, love game, love game, love game 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Trying to forget someone that you love 
 Like trying to remember someone that you never knew 
 Think about it, I dream about it 
 My nightmares haunting me, I can't sleep about it 
 Anxiety, can't breathe, can't live without you 
 The revival, all these verses is my survival 
 Standing at the poly and waiting for your arrival 
 One day but no return like Usher say, gotta let it burn 
 The hardest part of dreaming about someone you love 
 Is waking up to see that person gone 
 You know it, it it takes seconds to say hello 
 But forever to say goodbye 
 Moving on is easy, but what you leave behind is what makes it hard
