All I see is black crowns 
 King me 'cause this is my time now 
 So all you other niggas bow down 
 'Cause all I see on me is black crowns 
 Black crowns 
 Uh, heavenly father, appoint me to the coronation 
 I deserve it, brought music for clarification 
 Envision my past, Egypt reincarnated 
 Negativity hill, over the hump camels waiting 
 Never gave up, most of my peers forsaken 
 One make it, we all make it but I delivered that patient 
 King chronicles, never write it too logical 
 Fake niggas saying 'What up, fam?' but we ain't biological 
 Hands down to my mother, she the greatest ever 
 Since I was the only child, wasn't too much to stress her 
 Waking up before work, leaving allowance on the dresser 
 Raising the prince under pressure, no king, no refuge 
 It's all good, got homies like Boyz 'n' the Hood 
 We all good, I mean no matter what circumstances was 
 Champagne, weed, pills, it do the same 
 These niggas gassed up, too much butane 
 Working hard like one day I'll afford the 4-door Porsche 
 Approaching every corner cautious 
 Too much shopping, niggas calling you a target 
 Too much flossing, niggas gossiping in your blog shit 
 I rather put one in the air, congratulate careers 
 Death defying moments, people that I ain't seen in years 
 What you running from when you you're your only fear? 
 Guess my time is here, now... 
 All I see is black crowns 
 King me 'cause this is my time now 
 So all you other niggas bow down 
 'Cause all I see on me is black crowns 
 Black crowns 
 Uh, fatigue, I'm feeling jaded 
 She gave me the number but I ain't never saved it 
 Shit is solid, why these niggas played it? 
 Dealt the right cards, but I ain't get to play it 
 Determine payrolls, living the lifestyle 
 You couldn't be in if you was to see it right now 
 I think I see it right now 
 They judge me every day, life on trial 
 Take your money, niggas betting on my downfall 
 Many all real hoes, bitches gonna call 
 Five fingers, pledge allegiance to my one God 
 We'd have been through hell, so heaven ain't far 
 Two cars sedans, tearing it on the way to the Grammys 
 Guess we nominated, guess they appreciate us 
 These niggas often imitate us 
 We just stay creative 
 All I see is black crowns 
 King me 'cause this is my time now 
 So all you other niggas bow down 
 'Cause all I see on me is black crowns 
 Black crowns 
 One time in the, one time in the air for the... 
 Two, two, two times in the, two times in the air for the... 
 Both hands, both hands, both hands in the air for the... 
 One time, two times, times... 
 (Outro: Tyga's Mother) 
 Just wanted to call to let you know how proud I am 
 Sweetie, this album is amazing 
 I have never imagined that God would bless you so much 
 As he is going to continue to bless you 
 He's already made you the king that you are 
 Only one to wear the black crown 
 Well, I just want you to know how much I love you 
 And how awesome you are 
 And how I am so, so honored to have a son as yourself 
 I could never have ask for more, you're just amazing 
 And I am just so excited for this album 
 I think this album is definitely your baby 
 And it's definitely gonna be heard by a lot of people 
 And a lot of people are going to love it 
 They're gonna love it, love it, love it 
 And God's gonna continue to bless you with all the talents that you... 
 I'm just so proud, I just wanna shed a tear right now 
 OK mommy loves you and you the best thing ever 
 You are my heart. I love you sweetie, bye bye
