 Same old nigga, make a stack in a day 
 She the same since high school, back in the day 
 Cute face, thick thighs with the lil' bitty waist 
 Since she just finished school, now she work in the back 
 Now I'm all in the bank, all in the bank 
 Probably with some niggas that be robbin' the bank 
 Robbin' the bank, now it's all in the paper 
 And she told me all about said "I wanna see you later" 
 But I'm in too deep... 
 She said she had a nigga but the nigga weak 
 Said I had a bitch but she told me she too mean 
 Man I really wanna see you, call me when the nigga leave 
 You know I'll be right back over 
 Spend a night over 
 Mixin' in ya cup, she don't like being sober 
 In love with her man, so she said it's gettin' late 
 Can't stay, Now we right back arguing 
 She say I'm trynna make this work, you're doin' it again 
 Fuck this shit, I'm out this bitch 
 Say I'm out this bitch (I'm out this bitch) 
 Say I'm out this bitch (I'm out this bitch) 
 Say I'm out this bitch (I'm out this bitch) 
 She tell me 
 "You could have that bitch, you ain't bout shit, fuck this shit, I'm out this bitch" 
 She like "fuck that shit" 
 She got me like "fuck that bitch!" 
 Say I'm out this bitch... 
 Now I'm right back in the same position 
 With the same bitch that I said I was quittin' 
 A minute ago, my control over these hoes 
 Dealing with emotions I don't wanna show 
 It's like one or two flaws 
 Don't wanna be involved with her at all 
 Tired of waiting, I'm gettin' impatient 
 Cheating lately with her best friend 
 And the head game crazy 
 Single now, livin' life, wildin' on the daily 
 Ain't got time for no sorry, I just bought a Ferrari 
 Cost me 280, now these bitches wanna call me by my real name 
 Baby, ain't got time for now motherfuckin' questions 
 To my exes, hope you learned your lesson 
 While you out stressin', I'm somewhere out sexin' 
 On to the next one, onto the next thing 
 No you ain't trippin' (No you ain't trippin'...) 
 All on the TV, now she tryna text me 
 She say I'm trynna make this work, you're doin' it again 
 Fuck this shit, I'm out this bitch 
 Say I'm out this bitch (I'm out this bitch) 
 Say I'm out this bitch (I'm out this bitch) 
 Say I'm out this bitch (I'm out this bitch) 
 She tell me 
 "You could have that bitch, you ain't bout shit, fuck this shit, I'm out this bitch" 
 She like "fuck that shit" 
 She got me like "fuck that bitch!" 
 Say I'm out this bitch... 
 Say I'm out this bitch... 
 Say I'm out this bitch... 
 We-we-well done
