I live a better life 
 Catch me out, Every night 
 Meet her once, Maybe Skype 
 Plus I only f-ck them twice 
 Only rules that apply 
 We don't cuff them, Let them fly 
 If she think there's better things 
 That bitch in for a surprise 
 Light a candle, Prayer vigil 
 Another rapper dies 
 Trying to steal my flow 
 Must have thought I was blind 
 I see your videos 
 Youtube'n' lil hoes 
 Bitch ain't even Georgia code 
 That's your girl, I ain't know 
 Watching Belly on the iTunes 
 N-ggas barely on iTunes 
 Only moment is if I'm featured on it 
 I heard his rumors when I'm in the room 
 Just 'cause a man starving 
 Don't mean he eat and drink the same water 
 Motha f-ckas got social problems 
 Online got ya feeling brave, Don't it 
 I'm paid homie 
 F-ck the myths, I'm the sh-t 
 Lyrical I can get 
 But what's the sense 
 When it's for cents, Double dollars 
 With a hit, Stop the bull shit 
 No cows walking, But she stupid thick 
 Ass like a donkey, Shout out Wiz 
 But I don't smoke 
 But you could still watch the Benz roll up, Hoe 
 Models on my phone 
 Super models at my show 
 Money on my mind at all times 
 And it's time for more 
 Looking at my watch 
 Oyster perpetual 
 Like what you see 
 But don't touch it hoe 
 Rolli on my arm, What it cost man 
 New deposit came in, Another 100 grand 
 The end is near, The bible says it is 
 So I'ma rep Young Money till the f-cking end 
 Models on my phone 
 Super models at my show 
 Money on my mind 
 Oyster perpetual 
 Don't touch it hoe 
 Rolli on my arm, what it cost man 
 New deposit came in, Another 100 grand 
 The end is near, The bible says it is 
 So I'ma rep Young Money till the f-cking end 
 Models on my phone 
 Super models at my show 
 Money on my mind at all times 
 And it's time for more 
 Looking at my watch 
 Oyster perpetual 
 Like what you see 
 But don't touch it hoe 
 But don't touch it hoe 
 But don't touch it hoe 
 But don't touch it hoe 
 Like what you see 
 But don't touch it hoe
