 Lil homie, (Wassup big dog) 
 Everybody tryna get with you, come on 
 Lil homie, (Wassup big dog) 
 Stay focused, got shit to do, yeah, come on 
 (Verse 1: Tyga) 
 They say what don't break a nigga make a nigga 
 I woke up out my dream, said I gotta get it 
 This whole city full of thieves, gotta watch my pivot 
 Cause on the block, niggas never seen good living 
 Only lived in jail cells or prison 
 Drive-bys, little homies hit the store for liquor 
 I gotta steer my life different, where to begin with? 
 Mama told me go back to school, I said I'm finished 
 There's only one way a nigga gonna learn: 
 You gotta take risks and do things the hard way 
 Stole the hall pass, now I'm running through the hallways 
 Only thing in my memory from those days 
 You couldn't save a nigga, even on a Sunday 
 Monday, new day, shit still the same 
 Gotta switch the rhythm up like Kwame 
 When things changed, watch people do the same 
 As I hear a voice sing: 
 (Hook: Pharrell) 
 Lil homie, (Wassup big dog) 
 Everybody tryna get with you, come on 
 Lil homie, (Wassup big dog) 
 Stay focused, got shit to do, yeah, come on 
 (Verse 2: Tyga) 
 Big boy grown, can't leave the streets alone 
 Wanna be a king, but you're too young for the throne 
 Why you riding in the car that you can't afford? 
 Can't move forward in the 4-door chrome 
 All that cheap talk I never did 
 My walk is Billie Jean, my shoes are never slip 
 Notice how close he is, gold his goals that approachin' him 
 They can't stop the win losing's not an option 
 First place locked in, get my trophy ready bitch 
 Turn your back on me only gon' leave you dead 
 Fuck that bullshit I got common sense 
 I'm ready for my limelight put my mic in hand 
 They'll dissolve when the money's gone 
 So motherfucka don't appear when the money's home 
 Lil' homie done grew into a big dog 
 If you barking in my way you gettin' chewed on 
 (Hook: Pharrell) 
 Lil homie, (Wassup big dog) 
 Everybody tryna get with you, come on 
 Lil homie, (Wassup big dog) 
 Stay focused, got shit to do, yeah, come on 
 (Bridge: Pharrell + Tyga) 
 See your friends walking up and down your block 
 Ain't got a penny-nenny-nenny-nenny 
 Just picture yourself sittin' there on top 
 A nigga straight winnin-in-in-in-in-in-in 
 Nigga straight winnin', you see how I did it 
 Bottom to the top take 'em back to the beginnin' 
 All my niggas winnin', you see how we did it 
 Dreamt it now we live it 
 Now we all winnin', me and my 
 (Hook: Pharrell) 
 Lil homie, (Wassup big dog) 
 Everybody tryna get with you, come on 
 Lil homie, (Wassup big dog) 
 Stay focused, got shit to do, yeah, come on
