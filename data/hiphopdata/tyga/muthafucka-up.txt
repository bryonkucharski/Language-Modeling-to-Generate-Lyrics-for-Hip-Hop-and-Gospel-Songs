 YMCMB, rawest niggas doing it 
 School for the blind, I don't see these niggas doing it 
 I'm doing it and doing it and doing it well 
 Niggas wanna test me boy, who wanna fail? 
 Hit you like a bully bitch, yeah saved by the bell 
 If you scared, go to church I'll see you in hell 
 And your girl, she a flip, give me heads or tails 
 Everybody fake so I got real for sale 
 Gunpowder fill the air 
 Rappers shittin' on theyself, you could smell the fear 
 And these bitches laying flowers cause the king is near 
 T-Raw this is the new flavour in ya ear 
 Niggas softer than baby hair 
 Why you acting tough, heard you work at Build-a-bear 
 I'ma a dealer all my girls come in deuce and pairs

 What the funk you beezy's want

 That 110 Sup', that Ferrari Caliornia 
 Niggas want beef, call me Tony Romo 
 You potatoes on the sofa 
 Lazy muthafuckas why you ain't even trying 
 Rich or die trying, why you niggas ain't died yet?

 And I'm with the business skip peon with a ty clip 
 Stay on the flight yeah I'ma trip

 Can't see you niggas, you like a little germ 
 Bitches know I'm excellent like Mr Burns 
 See my dick like Butter churn 
 Baby churn and ya girl with me fo'shure 
 That ain't your concern 
 She forgot about her other man, she will never learn 
 On a mic till I die, RIP chick huh 
 Yessir, colder than the Pittsburgh? 
 Winter fresher than a Will Smith T-Shirt 
 These spurts coming through Last King and a hearse 
 Ask later, shoot first, got shooters like dirt 
 When it hurts leave you losers bruised up 
 Bruce Lee nunchucks 
 Toe from the floor up though 
 Duck, rubber duck now you like oh shucks 
 Tell the neighbours I don't give a fuck
