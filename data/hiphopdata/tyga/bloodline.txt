Have not betrayed your ideals 
 Your ideals betrayed you 
 Your eyes will not close 
 What are you gonna do? 
 Why blood wanna take mine? 
 Tell 'cause won't take mine 
 I'm just tryna make way for my bloodline 
 Gotta make a way for my bloodline 
 So make way, nigga, in due time 
 Paid dues and I'm due mine 
 Tryna make way for my bloodline 
 Stained blood through my bloodline 
 So why 'cause wanna take mine? 
 Why blood wanna take mine? 
 Tryna make way for my bloodline 
 Gotta make a way for my bloodline 
 So make way, nigga, in due time 
 Paid dues and I'm due mine 
 Tryna make way for my bloodline 
 Stained blood through my bloodline 
 They said it's racist, black on black faces 
 Can't portray a nigga when you're called it daily 
 Days I've dreamt, defeated diplomatic immunity 
 Ain't shit safe, livin' in a gated community 
 I put miles on this hooptie, my heroine's tookie 
 Never seen real life like a gangster movie 
 Though we kept that Uzi, black gators, we're movin' 
 Like pharaohs in tombs, bitch, I'm back in tune, bitch 
 Black out the room, we birthed into this 
 Who is this new nigga? Who is the proven? 
 Hundred percent real, no silicone music 
 I don't do it for you niggas, I just do it to do it 
 Years ago I swear I was Prince Zamunda 
 Now I'm King T Ruler 
 Never know when you're winnin' till you start losin' 
 Can't lose it 
 Have not betrayed your ideals 
 Your ideals betrayed you 
 Your eyes will not close 
 What are you gonna do? 
 Why 'cause wanna take mine? 
 Why blood wanna take mine? 
 I'm just tryna make way for my bloodline 
 Gotta make a way for my bloodline 
 So make way, nigga, in due time 
 Paid dues and I'm due mine 
 Tryna make way for my bloodline 
 Stained blood through my bloodline 
 Why blood wanna take mine? 
 Tell 'cause won't take mine 
 Tryna make way for my bloodline 
 Gotta make a way for my bloodline 
 So make way, nigga, in due time 
 Paid dues and I'm due mine 
 Tryna make way for my bloodline 
 Stained blood through my bloodline 
 (What are you gonna do?) 
 I'm King Ramses of my era 
 Pacin' everlastin' love, couldn't take me this far 
 But still my heart racin' to new life and past relations 
 I'm on deck, Last King, standin' formation 
 Take a look at your life 'fore you judge mine 
 Middle finger high, fuck a peace sign 
 Please give me somethin' to write about, it's been too long 
 23 years behind bars, no father, shoulder to lean on 
 No love lost, just cold found 
 I just... wanna see wealth and my family smile 
 Wanna pass a better generation down 
 Cosigned since a child, let him make his way down 
 A man who they praise now, gon' kneel down, say a prayer loud 
 I'm here, niggas actin' like I had invitations 
 Like a nigga just slept, woke up in a mansion and shit 
 Like a nigga in the club all night dancin' and shit 
 Like the Jamie Foxx Show, bitches actin' fancy and shit 
 Shit... if I could I would, my nigga 
 Right now I'm just focused, livin' good, my nigga 
 All that shit on TV lookin' good, my nigga 
 Shit, you doin' your thing, as you should, my nigga 
 As you should, my nigga 
 Keep doin' your thing 
 I see you 
 Just take it day by day 
 Can't take this shit when you leave 
 Only thing you leave behind is your bloodline 
 Keep doin' your thing, my nigga 
 As you should, my nigga 
 As you should, my nigga
