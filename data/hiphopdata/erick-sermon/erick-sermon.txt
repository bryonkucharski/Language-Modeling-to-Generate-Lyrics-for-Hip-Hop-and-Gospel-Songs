(Erick Sermon) 
 Owww! 
 Word 'em up, word 'em up yo 
 Yeah yeah, word 'em up like dat 
 Erick Sermon's in effect 
 Def Squad, that's the hype 
 One more time word 
 Yeah 
 Yeah, mackadocious shit 
 Yeah 
 This is my openin, E comin' at ya lazy style 
 Versatile, crazy wild with my profile 
 Dominatin the microphone, on my own 
 Freakin it, with the ill vocal tone 
 Outspoken, here's a token of my appreciation 
 I bring drama like Jason 
 Who can see me? You better ask Superman 
 For his super vision, 'cause I'm on a fuckin' mission 
 Test my skills, and I rearrange your fuckin' grill 
 Will kill if I have to get ill 
 Get away, carry on, and step 
 Like the S1's, cause my crew carry big guns 
 To blow up, anybody in the range 
 And plus I'm bad as Michael Jackson, even though he +Dangerous+ 
 E Double with the funk type shit 
 This is it, so get with the skit motherfucker
