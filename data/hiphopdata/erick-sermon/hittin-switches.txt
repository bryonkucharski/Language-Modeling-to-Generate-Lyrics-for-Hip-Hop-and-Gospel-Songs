(Shadz of lingo) 
 Yeah, this is colorado from shadz of lingo 
 Kickin it with the funklord himself, e double 
 Hittin' switches, and we bout to get stupid 
 So you know, yo e, check it 
 (Erick sermon) 
 Ah yeah one two, hey young world, hey young world {"it's on!"} 
 Mic check, here I go again, check me out 
 Bust the flavor {"hey"} you know my clout 
 Rough and rugged -- funk's the contact I hit you with 
 To make your head split, trip and do a backflip 
 I swing it hardcore like an orangutang 
 I bring it wicked, and freak the funk slang 
 Like God damn, yeah dude gnarly, fuckin' a 
 I don't play-doh, my nickname ain't clay 
 It's the e double, mackaframa, bust the grammar 
 My style is sickening, like roseanne-ah 
 Plus, I'm funky like atomic dog 
 Boy you can't see me, I'm thicker than fog, so 
 Save that drama, here's a floppy disk don't risk it 
 Boo-yaa, that's my biscuit! 
 On the mic, I cover every angle 
 A square, tri-part to a rectangle 
 I mean dat wit a passion, so be it 
 When I rock the mic it's worth seein 
 So cop a squad and parlay bitch 
 With the e-r-i-c-k, while I'm hittin' switches 
 Chorus: erick sermon (repeat 2x) 
 Off and on, off and on, it's on (4x) 
 Hittin' switches! 
 (Erick sermon) 
 Ah shit, it's part two, it's on with the funk so 
 Ring the alarm, ding! while I drop the bomb 
 On the country, e's gettin' funky word to mother 
 I smother, any emcee or so-called brother 
 Why? I gets busy, who the hell is he? 
 The roughneck from new york city 
 You wanna mess around with the ill bastard 
 Then get your ass kicked, messin with the click 
 Def squad, now on location, with the funky sensation 
 You wanna step you must be freebasin 
 Punk, why you playin', you bored? 
 You can't afford, to get choked by the mic cord 
 I keep you drunk like whiskey, solve the mystery 
 Ummmm, without agatha christie (there we go) 
 You think you know what's going on 
 Without marvin gaye around, c'mon let's get down 
 I spark your brain with all funk material 
 And gettin' wicked, and let wilson pickett 
 Before I break, let me announce - get the bozack 
 Now we all can bounce, as I'm hittin' switches 
 (Erick sermon) 
 (Switch) back in effect mode, droppin' loads 
 Watch me explode with the devil in me like crossroads 
 And ding-a-ling-a-ling with the guitar, freak the funk speech 
 Make the contact strong as bleach 
 Rock the mic make the vibes right, and plus dy-no-mite 
 So I can fly high like mike and "just do it" 
 And get freaky-deaky on the real, grab the steel 
 In case there's caps to peel 
 In the mix, when I flex the context, beware 
 Like when you're havin' safe sex 
 I continue to get brand new, one two 
 My mic held tight, so I can recite the hype 
 And get busy, my name is erick sermon 
 Back for the adventure, without pee-wee herman 
 For those who don't know, don't act suspicious 
 While I'm hittin' switches
