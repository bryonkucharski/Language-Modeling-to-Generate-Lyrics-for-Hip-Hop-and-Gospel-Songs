Sex 
 Have some sex 
 Safe sex 
 Word 'em up 
 Okay, it's time for some action 
 A little passion, some booty waxin' 
 For the bozac, make sure he's strapped 
 And if baby got back, then yo, we with that 
 Call up a few people on the phone 
 Yo we're havin' a party, at my private home 
 Some bring some chronic, plus some brew 
 Call up your girl and invite her too 
 Come active and bring purple lactives 
 'Cause we're gonna get more busy than gymnastics 
 And do the humpty hump all night 
 So when you come with the boy, make sure you're right 
 It's nine o'clock, party starts at ten 
 So enough for now, I'll talk to you then 
 Later, huh, I'll see you when you get here 
 And make it quick, ah yeah 
 Time for some safe sex 
 Safe sex 
 Safe sex 
 Safe sex 
 We all need (safe sex) 
 Ding dong, there goes the bell 
 I opened up the door and oh, what the hell 
 It was a buncha niggas standin' by my door 
 I said come in, but respect my floor 
 That means take off your shoes and englands 
 'Cause I'm a gentleman, some say distinguished 
 All of y'all put your things up in the kitchen 
 And the rest of y'all sit down and listen 
 Be free and relax in what you're wearin' 
 Let's all be happy like Bobby McFerrin 
 And get loose and produce the funky juice 
 And let's swing this shit like they swing a forty deuce 
 They want some reggae, like some flex 
 Time to have sex 
 And it's all night, so turn off the light 
 And let's get high as a kite 
 And have safe sex 
 Somebody say sex (sex) 
 Say safe sex (safe sex) 
 I love it (I love it) 
 I need it (I need it) 
 But for real, when you're havin' sex 
 No matter what type, make sure you wear the latex 
 To all of the cons out there sexin' 
 Stop and look, boy, you're stressed out protection 
 Cause aids is real and something to believe 
 Or not make-believe and fake like hair weave 
 A death wish like Charles Bronson 
 And if you don't believe me then ask Magic Johnson 
 About the sex
