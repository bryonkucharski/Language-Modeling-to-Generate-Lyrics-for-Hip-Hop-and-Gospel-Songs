 Here we go cruisin, me and my boys rollin' four deep 
 In the a-u streets, seein who we can meet 
 Beep beep, a crew of girls in their green cherokee 
 Screamin, "that's erick g," my boys gettin' happy b 
 Err, errr, the girls made a u-turn 
 Pulled up beside me, tires smellin burned (yeah yeah) 
 I scoped the whole car yo before I spoke 
 To see which one was dope before I start actin' loc 
 That's crazy, "how you doin' baby? the one 
 With the daisies, short top with the paisleys 
 What's your name? oh they call you lucky? " 
 Had child's play on my mind but none of us was chucky 
 "So what are you doin' follow me to my crib" 
 I had the girls trailin, had my system wailin (boom boom) 
 Drove off, and my boys screamin loud 
 Happy for the hoes because they wasn't crows (word me up) 
 We argued, on who gets who 
 The first pick is mine, respect from my crew 
 I took the freaky deaky one who was drivin' 
 She looked like she was widdit, I definitely want to hit it 
 (Word 'em up) jeff screamed, "we're goin' out for the cause 
 And when we get there, we're goin' straight for the drawers" 
 Dude - they was bangin', I must try not to keep them hangin' 
 Yeah - but I find myself singin'

 On the way home, damn I almost crashed with my friends 
 Four girls in two drop-top bm's 
 Man it must be a dream, I must be on the wrong planet 
 Four girls, lookin' like janet (yeah yeah) 
 +That's the way love goes+ when you're clockin hoes 
 Nobody knows, but my face expression shows (yeah yeah) 
 I was wide open, man I couldn't believe it 
 If the girl asked me for my truck, I swear she can keep it 
 (Word 'em up) on the pharcyde, the girls +passed me by+ 
 The ones who was trailin me, goin' in the cherokee 
 But fuck em, I didn't care anymore 
 Cause these girls was the flyest bitches I ever saw 
 (Word 'em up) so me and my boys approached to the cars 
 Stepped out to the females, lookin' like some stars (word 'em up yo) 
 Hi, my name is erick, whassup, how y'all doin'? 
 Just coolin like levert in y'all tennis skirts (word 'em up) 
 How bout y'all comin' to my crib and take a swim 
 And maybe darken up the skins (yeah) 
 Are you widdit? c'mon, follow me to hook up my friends 
 With your friends, then we all can be friends, word - yeah 
 Go on the way, I'm jumpin' on the highway 
 Mad traffic and shit, because it was a Friday 
 I check my rearview, lookin' right behind me 
 Girls in the bm, lookin' kinda fine see 
 My mind playin' tricks on me already 
 Someone turned off the lights, yo it musta been teddy 
 Oh somebody tell me what's happenin' 
 I'm caught up, this ain't the way me and my boys was brought up 
 (Word 'em up) maybe I'm gettin' excited - not 
 There's no doubt in my mind that that girl is hot 
 Yeah - and matter of fact, she got the blazin' looks 
 Make me wanna sing this hook
