 Word up. 
 Me and my crew in the Benz for a deek, while other peeps trailing me in the 
 Black jeep 
 Creepin', on our way to a House Party, with no Kid 'N' Play just a fly DJ 
 I't on and poppin' and we gettin' RIGHT, everythings TIGHT 
 Everyone has a light, I pull up in the place to be, immediately swarmed 
 And all of us is armed, it's cool like that type of scene, crazy blunt 
 Ashes 
 Girls shaking asses, money makers, video rumpshakes 
 And niggas with game fast breakin' just like the Lakers 
 It's all good if your game is tight, and if you know the scoop don't love 
 'Em like Snoop 
 Yeah, the reason why, the girls out there get biz, run like a bunch of wild 
 Kids 
 I'm doin' my thing if you feel me do your thing 
 (Do your thang do your thang) (X4) 
 Now the scene is set and now I'm hype 
 I'm seeing what girls is coming home with me tonight 
 I spot one on the sofa, sippin' juice, with three other girls, sportin' pin 
 Curls 
 I said to myself "Excuse yourself E", so I went over and put my hand out 
 Like Billy Dee 
 Excuse her from the two girls she was with, Macked her put the Flava In her 
 Ear and split 
 To the side to the other vibe, where it looked live, protected cause my man 
 Had the 4-5 
 My boy looked up, asked me if he was hooked up 
 I said she was shook up, she threw my phone book up 
 She gave me every phone number that she knew, a girlfriend for you, a 
 Girlfriend for you (word up) 
 I stay real, I never perpetrate, cause now adays, falling in love never 
 Pays 
 I'm quick to say fuck a hoe (yeah) y'all niggas know, I'm strickly for the 
 Doe 
 Word to God, this is the way that Def Squad swing, it's not just a one day 
 Fling 
 I represent my style for my peeps, take it to the streets, where we play 
 For keeps 
 Have a drink conversate, and pump up your fists and do it like this
