Yo yo yo yo, yo 
 Turn my mic up some... turn my mic up some... 
 Turn my mic, check check, check, turn my mic up some 
 Almighty, uh... 
 (Verse One) 
 Lord forgive me now 
 This be the best way I know how, to get this out 
 I can't sing so I have to bounce 
 Even though, that's not what my style's about 
 I hate this world, sometimes it gets me 
 When family and friends are not friendly 
 I just don't get it - so I sit home 
 In the bassment lights low on the mic and spit it 
 They plot, to get my scratch 
 Not knowin' the time to get where I'm at now 
 In my face, like I owe 'em somethin' 
 Handout from me, and never did nuttin (word up) 
 They're mad at me, like I changed 
 It's hard on me Lord, it's wreckin my brain 
 Is it me? I know it can't be 
 So I ask you, please help me, now 
 (Chorus: R. Kelly] [sampled) 
 Sometimes I laugh, tryin' to keep from cryin 
 If I was plain out of luck, then tell me who could I trust 
 See I work so hard, just to get ahead 
 If it wasn't for God, I'd probably be dead 
 (Verse Two) 
 Uh, I laugh when ain't nuttin funny 
 Meanwhile cats wanna count my money 
 Plan on me, to get jumped or somethin' 
 Plot-ting like E's punk or somethin' 
 Feels so strange, how I maintain 
 To last in the game, throughout my fame 
 I'm focused man, the E stay the same 
 Hate when folks call me out my name 
 Damn Lord, heal my body 
 'Cause I'm mad enough to kill somebody 
 Even hard to trust my lady 
 Did she lock me down to have my baby? 
 I know she love me - damn it's nuttin 
 The world's so corrupt, it got me buggin 
 Uh, I wanna move away like (?) 
 Y'all feel me - yo, R. Kelly 
 (Verse Three) 
 Huh, yo, huh 
 The game changed, damn I should quit 
 Can't get respect, without havin' a hit 
 Someone somewhere talkin' shit 
 Got fake cats in my clique 
 But I deal with the cards that's dealt 
 Try to make music that's heartfelt 
 Still doin' eighty on the Belt' 
 In the Escalade, with Dolce shades 
 I've been paid, now what's left? 
 I guess, should I stress life or death (huh?) 
 Sometimes I wanna end it all 
 Live at peace, with 'Pac and Smalls 
 Can't do that, got fam at the crib 
 My moms, my pops, my girl and my kids (uh-huh) 
 ... Open my eyes 
 So I ask you, please help me, now
