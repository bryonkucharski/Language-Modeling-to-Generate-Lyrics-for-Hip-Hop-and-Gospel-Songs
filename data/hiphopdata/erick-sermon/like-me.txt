(Sy Scott) 
 You can't rap like me 
 Uh, Sy Scott, Def Squad (yeah) 
 Listen, ain't playin' no games man 
 Yeah, whattup 
 Give or receive, and give or take, I'm an Indian giver 
 I take back what's given to the getter from the giver 
 Nigga give way, give up, you never get a glimpse 
 Of the Glimmer Man, glimmer glitter when I trek your body shiver 
 Rhythm I'm rippin whatever I can get a grip of 
 Just to get a giggle, this literature's ishkabibble 
 And damn, dun-duh dun-duh dun-duh, the shark is in the weater 
 Dun-duh dun-duh dun-duh got him right where I want him 
 Now I'ma get him, Scott crack legbones like a wishbone 
 Snap your nosebone witcha chinbone 
 Break your legs and snap your shinbone 
 Put your skullbone jawbone right next to your gall stones 
 Till y'all all know 
 I got the hypothalamus of a hippopotamus 
 Squashin the retardapuss when {?} rush 
 Too good to be true like fairy tales come true again 
 You wish you was me but woke up and you was you again 
 Sy Scott, you can't rap like me 
 You can't murder a rhyme or kill a track like me 
 You can't, bust aim or hold a gat like me 
 Flow hundred percent, you can't rap like me, nah 
 (Erick Sermon) 
 This here's somethin' stupid for the eardrum 
 You wanna hear somethin' slick son, here it come 
 You can ask Dr. Phil, I'm ill 
 I'ma kill you, then kill them, then "Kill Bill" 
 Yeah - word to Vivica, I hemorrhage a pile 
 Drop the temperature, till the coroner start zippin ya 
 B-ball player, I shoot from the perimeter 
 Two shot, three shot, all into ya 
 On mics I does my thing 
 Agua, I flow like Poland Spring 
 Not from Maine, I'm from New York mayne 
 I'm the Bandit, in the black Maybach in transit 
 300 pound nigga, hold weight, stop - hold, wait 
 E-Dub the great there's no mitake, yeah 
 The untakeable, unshakeable, you uncapable 
 I'm Bruce Willis, I'm "Unbreakable" - uh-huh 
 You can't replace the unplaceable 
 You can't face off, with the unfaceable 
 Even the matador can't face the bull 
 I'm the raging bull, you wanna shoot, pull 
 E, you can't rap like me 
 The boy with the slow flow you can't rap like me 
 Bang bang, you can't shoot a gat like me 
 My Squad is Def, and you can't rap like Khari 
 (Khari) 
 I throw three like Bobby Jackson, at 'em 
 I'm O.G. like Bobby Johnson, stomp 'em 
 Hold G like Bumpy Jonson, on 'em 
 Read flip and beat kids like Joe Jackson 
 My flow jackin, clack clack, I'm sharp like the claws 
 Of Hugh Jack', with hands packin, make you an ex-man 
 Time for some action, and matter of fact 
 Go exercise or be ordained to explore pain 
 And explain, why you puttin' extras on 
 In this excess I throw a hex through your headset 
 Settle down 'fore I set it off on the set 
 Let's say Santiago is the best you heard yet (yep) 
 I know, my flow, oh my God, get so, heated 
 That MC's stay away like I got heebie jeebies 
 Ask G's if I G, hit the G spot on your queen 
 Kings get they heart or crown ripped apart now 
 Yeah, you can't rap like me 
 You snap back, get back, smack a wack MC 
 Santiago, you ain't got the stats like me 
 To get busy and tap dance on tracks like me
