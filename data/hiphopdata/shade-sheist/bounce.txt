 (Yeah yeah oh oh yeah yeah) 
 (Shade Sheist verse 1) 
 Yo I'm used to fine hoes 
 5 at a time hoes 
 Top of the line make you do a double take hoes 
 Hit the light show 
 Chill and watch how the birds on a prowl 
 Eazy find me in the crowd 
 Spot the watch gray 
 And they see the ice rite 
 Peep the keychain on the drop 
 Nice right 
 And I know what the want give me some get it hun 
 'Cause I hear it all the time shady get me get me one 
 So from ashy to flashy I service the life 
 And make them my wife but keep the warranty on the side 
 Cause ain't no pin-ups with prenups ya keep what ya got 
 'Cause if we split up we splittin a half of the rocks 
 'Cause you'll be lucky if ya leave with both of ya socks 
 And don't be tryin' to file abuse 'cause I'm cool with the cops 
 Press your luck fuckin' with shade 
 And I'll be singin' out like tq with bye bye baby 
 (TQ chorus) 
 Do you wanna 
 I got this feelin' tell me if I'm right 
 Are you the one I'm gonna take home tonight 
 If you wanna bounce rock roll with this 
 I gotta warn you miss we like gangsta shit 
 If ya ain't with it then stay here trick 
 Cause your homegirl is tight 
 Tell me do you wanna 
 (Shade Sheist verse 2) 
 Yo I'm known to snag birds with little to no words 
 Get 'em duckin in the truck, before they know what occurred 
 Hit my where I wanna be skytel alert to gettin' 'em very messy in the spot 
 Where it hurts 
 Fuckin' up affaris for chickens with long hair 
 And long legs with ginseng mouths for long hair with pretty eyes above 
 Big titties and trim thighs, who like them slim guys that rap and stay high 
 Them niggas who extend heads out expeds them real perverted 
 Niggas mackin out the club med, who spit the kinda shit that other niggas 
 Never said to get 
 The kind of bitches that would love to break beds nigga 
 (Shade Sheist Verse 3) 
 Yo if you still snatch Dames then we in the same game 
 TQ Shade Sheist you can add your own name 
 See how many birds like your baby ree chain 
 When you step up in the club with a fist ful of dubs and you buy 
 The whole bar for a price of a car 
 Wont you see how many birds flock just to see the star 
 'Cause the worlds his now 
 Like that nigga with the scar when he makes his movies now 
 Got it locked like a czar
