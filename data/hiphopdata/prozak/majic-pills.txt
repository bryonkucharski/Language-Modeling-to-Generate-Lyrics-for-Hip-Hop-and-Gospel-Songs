When I was five, they took me to a place with padded walls 
 They introduced me to these pills that would become my all 
 Forced me to wash my hands so many times it turned them raw 
 I've stared at pictures full ..., tell what I saw 
 They were so nice; they gave me cookies, milk and lemonade 
 Always rewarding me for the sick and twisted things I'd say 
 My daddy had insurance so I was a privileged child 
 I got more pills than any other kid around for miles 
 Everything's fine 
 THANKS TO MY NEW MAJIC... Pills 
 Works every time 
 THANKS TO MY NEW MAJIC... Pills 
 It helps my smile 
 THANKS TO MY NEW MAJIC... Pills 
 Sun always shines 
 THANKS TO MY NEW MAJIC... Pills 
 Pills... Pills... 
 Kept flashing images to try to see what makes me tick 
 Thought I was healthy but thank God they had discovered this 
 Sundays they use electric currents, though it makes me sick 
 So please don't cry mother, they promised blue cross covers it 
 I'll be the child you've always wanted, soon I swear I can 
 With more prescriptions in my system I can be a man 
 Always a problem child, genetically been led astray 
 Another magic pill to make my symptoms go away 
 Everything's fine 
 THANKS TO MY NEW MAJIC... Pills 
 Works every time 
 THANKS TO MY NEW MAJIC... Pills 
 It helps my smile 
 THANKS TO MY NEW MAJIC... Pills 
 Sun always shines 
 THANKS TO MY NEW MAJIC... Pills 
 Pills... Pills... 
 Told me that I had too much ambition for my own good 
 Keep him sedated, segregated, yes I think we should 
 There must be something wrong, we'll have to monitor his health 
 He must be crazy; he demands the right to think for self 
 That's not the proper the way to live in this society 
 You must obey, only existing to acquire thee 
 Don't worry son, with medication you will become well 
 Be just like me, your father's son 
 A corporate lifeless shell 
 Everything's fine 
 THANKS TO MY NEW MAJIC... Pills 
 Works every time 
 THANKS TO MY NEW MAJIC... Pills 
 It helps my smile 
 THANKS TO MY NEW MAJIC... Pills 
 Sun always shines 
 THANKS TO MY NEW MAJIC... Pills 
 Pills... Pills...
