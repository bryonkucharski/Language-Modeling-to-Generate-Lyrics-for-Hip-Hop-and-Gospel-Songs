When the sun goes down 
 And all the pieces crumble around 
 You feel you scream much can't make a sound 
 You'll never make it out alive 
 Before we say goodbye 
 We're are on the edge now tell me you can feel it coming 
 So much left to say before the end before there's nothing 
 Hard to put it in words because I know we're running 
 Out of time see the signs man it's all so numbing 
 All these tragedies and worldwide calamities 
 Humanity panicking scrambling man it's insanity 
 And memories is all we'll have and all we'll ever be 
 So when the curtains fall relax your soul and set it free 
 No use to fight it cause you can't press rewind 
 And you can't change the hands of time 
 No matter which way you slice it 
 If the sun doesn't rise then there is no sense in crying 
 And we dissolve back to dust 
 And enjoy the eternal silence 
 Where there is no pain no blame no hate inside us 
 And there is no shame no rage no acts of violence 
 No more chains or restrains to enslave or confide us 
 Finally free at last 
 When the sun goes down 
 And all the pieces crumble around 
 You feel you scream much can't make a sound 
 You'll never make it out alive 
 Before we say goodbye 
 I pray for all of you regardless of the god you choose 
 May you find some peace of mind and rest amongst the solitude 
 Take comfort and finally understand the magnitudes 
 To gratitude for the life that has been granted to me and you 
 Reach your inner pinnacle this is critical 
 No matter how difficult before we diminish the minerals 
 To put it simple life is an infinite symbol of emotions 
 Time and space existing outside your window 
 So you better find your place in this race and it's essential 
 To conveyed the faith and embrace the days before they dwindle 
 Without a trace to the grave you will be placed in the middle 
 Forsaken and laid to waste so shamefully superficial 
 And it's all perspective inclusive collective 
 Illusive perception and lucid deception 
 It seems we are down to nothing all we have left is each other 
 When the sun goes down 
 And all the pieces crumble around 
 You feel you scream much can't make a sound 
 You'll never make it out alive 
 Before we say goodbye
