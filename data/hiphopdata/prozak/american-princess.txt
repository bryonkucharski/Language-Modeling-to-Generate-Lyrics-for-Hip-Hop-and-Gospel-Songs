All around me are familiar faces 
 Worn out places, worn out faces 
 Bright and early for the daily races 
 Going nowhere, going nowhere 
 Their tears are filling up their glasses 
 No expression, no expression 
 Hide my head I wanna drown my sorrow 
 No tomorrow, no tomorrow 
 It started in a nice suburban home with white picket fences 
 This was the a life of a little princess 
 Such a happy girl with pigtails and curls 
 Such a bright future when daddy gave her the world 
 She got a Benz on her sweet sixteen the most popular 
 Nominated the highschool queen and her father was being quite nice 
 I mean not like a father's love, more like something else it seems 
 I know it bothers her wishing she could wake from this dream. 
 I know it's haunting her nobody was there to hear her scream 
 What has her father done she wishes she was eighteen 
 So she can up and run as far away as she can be 'cause... 
 All around me are familiar faces 
 Worn out places, worn out faces 
 Bright and early for the daily races 
 Going nowhere, going nowhere 
 She met a guy and his name was Jack 
 He served 12 weeks in basic training now he's off to Iraq 
 She holds her breath and counts the days till he flies back 
 But he never will cause Jack has died in combat 
 Her hope it seems her broken dreams now filled the body bag 
 And in return for his life she gets a folded flag 
 With some dogtags, but man it's so sad 
 The fact Jack will never have a chance to be a dad 
 She broke down when she heard this 
 Knowing that money's the only purpose for Jack joining the service 
 And now she is nervous her kid is crying and the bills are piling in 
 She keeps a smile on the surface 
 All around me are familiar faces 
 Worn out places, worn out faces 
 Bright and early for the daily races 
 Going nowhere, going nowhere 
 American princess is now a queen 
 But without a king 
 Her weary eyes has seen a lot of things 
 Not always pleasant but the future brings 
 A former shell of herself 
 She is on the streets now she is doing things 
 Drugs and alcohol can only help to ease the pain 
 But it seems like nothing in this life can hide her shame 
 Walking in the rain, and man it's so strange 
 She is thinking to herself how the hell the world changed 
 A car pulls up along the curb side another customer 
 It's time to get inside 
 She demands to get her money before she goes farther 
 The man turns his face, it was her own father. 
 All around me are familiar faces 
 Worn out places, worn out faces 
 Bright and early for the daily races 
 Going nowhere, going nowhere 
 Their tears are filling up their glasses 
 No expression, no expression 
 Hide my head I wanna drown my sorrow 
 No tomorrow, no tomorrow 
 All around me are familiar faces 
 Worn out places, worn out faces 
 Bright and early for the daily races 
 Going nowhere, going nowhere
