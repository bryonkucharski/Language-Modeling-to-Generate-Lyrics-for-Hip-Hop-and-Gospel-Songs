(Hook: Tyler Lyon) 
 Even though the world's around me 
 I feel lonely 
 Like I'm the only one 
 Even though the world has found me 
 It can drown me 
 It feels just like nothing 
 (Hook: Tyler Lyon) 
 (Verse 1: Prozak) 
 Maybe there's a reason I feel I'm the only one 
 I walk amongst 7 billion understood by none 
 A lost soul walking down the cross-roads 
 Searching for some sanctury, some peace of mind just to grab hold 
 Man overboard in the darkest sea of reality 
 Desperately trying to keep himself from sinking and he's frantically panicing and there's no sign of land 
 Can he manage to be that man that can handle this damage 
 And get back up on his feet again 
 Cause somewhere deep inside his abdomen he feels the burn and purpose to defeat these inner demons that seem to submerge him 
 That always seem to surface and cause a diversion, that sures him to crash and burn on his course to destiny's purpose 
 (Hook: Tyler Lyon) 
 (Verse 2: Prozak) 
 Maybe it's too late now I see the sky is faded 
 No turning back no second chance and that's an understatement 
 My only friend is my reflection and he's dissipatin' 
 Into these endless days of disarray I'm contemplatin' 
 Where did I go wrong, try to hold on -- be strong 
 Hard to feel that home when there's no place for me to belong 
 I guess it's back to packin down these back roads 
 With a black hole inside my chest that used to hold a soul 
 (Bridge: Prozak) 
 Maybe when it's all done I can finally realize 
 Why I felt alone through this journey of my life 
 And everything will finally make sense to me one day 
 But until then I wish I could make this go away
