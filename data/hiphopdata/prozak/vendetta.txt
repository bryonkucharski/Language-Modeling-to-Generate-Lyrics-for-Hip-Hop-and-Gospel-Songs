I don't know why you wanna push me 
 When I'm so close to the edge 
 You see and we can just prevent 
 This beef before I lose my mind 
 Walking a tight rope between sanity and psycho 
 Veins filled with nytro igniting like pyro 
 Needs a room to breathe before I'm reacting like Michael 
 Myers with violent desires to sever your spinal 
 Yes the urge is primal in vital to feed my rivals 
 By any means of survival leaving 'em dead on arrival 
 The beast unleashed, released proceeds to strike you 
 Defeat to lead to decease the repeat cycle 
 Claustrophobic now, everything is closing in 
 Is this reality or prison from within? 
 Very hard to focus as my mind slowly spins 
 Oh no, here it come, not this again 
 (I hate!) Everything about you hate! 
 Anything about (you hate!) 
 Everyone around (you hate!) fuck you! 
 And all that you're standing for 
 Maybe I should try to take a deep breath 
 I can't see the reason with my own self 
 Focus is only showing my true hell 
 I'm blackin' out thinking about all of this 
 Jeckyll and Hyde shit, friend on other pilot 
 My mentality riot, unsustainable climate 
 Melt down, time split, personality conflict 
 See it in my iris, dilated I'm just 
 Thinking of killing you, drilling you, filling you with venom 
 Struggling cause the thought of murder is so compelling 
 Deep inside of me is a demented monster dwelling 
 Like Bruce Banner can't get a handle, dismantle everything 
 And now that the rage has consumed me 
 Andrenaline lettin' in purely 
 Each and every self is with fury 
 Revenge is all that consumes me 
 At the end of the day I don't know what else to say 
 So if the shoe fits, wear it and stay the fuck away 
 This is predator speaking directly to the prey 
 May we never cross paths in the same place 
 Stir with lambs so we're facing the same space 
 Mind state, mine grain, bones will break 
 Strange brain, blood drain, screams of pain 
 Placing great seal fate, no trace
