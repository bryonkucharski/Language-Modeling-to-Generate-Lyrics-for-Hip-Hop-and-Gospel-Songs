Living in these dark times, it's hard to stop these dark rhymes 
 It seems that we have lost before we've even crossed the start line 
 Metaphor for human race what's in store for heaven's sakes 
 Watching ourselves dissipate and even worse participate 
 In our own demise think about it read between the lines 
 Damn we must be blind to see the signs we're almost out of time 
 And reality might not always be what you might hope 
 Sometimes you're really feeling like you're walking across a tightrope 
 Above a sea of uncertainty and certainly it hurts worse to be 
 Coerced because of loss of freedom hurts worse than a third degree 
 Burn let the ashes fall yearn pick up the pieces y'all 
 Gotta learn to hear the call turn before you hit the wall 
 Sink or swim make it count 
 Trust your friends when in doubt 
 Make amends take a vow 
 Opposition take them out 
 Never let nothing get between you and your hope and your dreams 
 We've suffered long enough now it's time they hear our screams 
 If we could start all over a million miles from here 
 Could we eliminate the hate inside and all our fears 
 Or would you keep it going our self-inflicted hell 
 We gotta reach for peace before history can repeat itself 
 We got do the math, find out the final score 
 I swear we're knock knock knocking up on heaven's door 
 And as the world turns we get closer to the fate 
 It really makes you wonder what's the purpose what's at stake 
 What are we meant to do besides living and breathing 
 Why must we try to live outside our means and stay daydreaming 
 Material things and money seem to be our obsession 
 And when it isn't that it's killing with billions spent on weapons 
 We gotta coexist which means we gotta focus this 
 Hope for utopian bliss despite our newfound hopelessness 
 Back then religious beliefs is what kept us separated 
 Now it's the power struggle for financial domination 
 Sins of the father continue passed on to generations 
 Maybe one day we can unite as one a sovereign nation 
 Take for what it is but don't take it for granted 
 And always suspect the unexpected on this unsuspecting planet 
 If we could start all over a million miles from here 
 Could we eliminate the hate inside and all our fears 
 Or would we keep it going, our self-inflicted hell 
 We gotta reach for peace before history can repeat itself
