Sitting back just thinking about the lives I've touched 
 The hearts and minds through my lines, rhymes and such 
 Try to fill the void they can't seem to get enough 
 Up the open road, hit the stage such a rush 
 But sometimes I lime light just think by [?] 
 To outshine the darkside that I disgust 
 Makes my teeth grind and choice making my life rough 
 Feels like handcuffs makes it hard to stand tough 
 So outta place, so outta patience, so outta touch 
 Just need a break, some safe haven with any luck 
 I break away from this endless days of gray stuff 
 Life against the grain, turn the page, turn this up 
 Where did the time go? x3 
 Tell me where did the time go? 
 If you could see inside me 
 All these things that terrorize me 
 Always there to still reminds me 
 That I can't never be someone like you 
 (I can't never be someone like you) 
 The sorrows of my life help to ease the pain anothers 
 They can sense it in my voice, all the rain and thunder 
 All the strain, all the shame, all the stress I'm under 
 It makes for better songs, scream emotions when you suffer 
 All these lyrics, each and every word is therapy 
 Spilling my soul on the paper, then through speakers to set it free 
 But honestly I'm just a self tortured anomy 
 And terribly damning myself to second guess and all of me 
 Oftenly complicated and jaded, so plain to see 
 Orchestrated chaos it's I'll ever be 
 I'm a lot harmony lost from the darkest antacid 
 Tossed in deepest oceans, civilization so outta reach 
 Where did the time go? x3 
 Tell me where did the time go? 
 If you could see inside me 
 All these things that terrorize me 
 Always there to still reminds me 
 That I can't never be someone like you 
 (I can't never be someone like you)
