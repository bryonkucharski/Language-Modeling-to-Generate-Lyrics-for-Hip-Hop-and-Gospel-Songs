You gotta watch your own back cause nobody else will 
 This is a game of survival, it's kill or be killed 
 You are surrounded by rivals that only think ill 
 This is a time for reaction, this ain't no stand still 
 You gotta place yourself on high alert like Defcon 
 Pierce through the skull of your adversaries like Tevlon 
 You gotta stand up for yourself 'fore getting stepped on 
 Not have to sleep with those sticky serpents decepticons 
 You gotta stand up and now back up your self-confidencing 
 Tape from the shreds like CIA documents 
 Black ops pack Glocks, rock spots, onslaughts 
 Pour shots, Hitchcock, hip-hop, top notch 
 There's no surrender, never homie, at any cost 
 You've always got yourself when all the hope is lost 
 We in this together, this modern riot's holocaust 
 You the flame of the motherfuckin Molotov 
 There's no surrender, never homie, at any cost 
 You've always got yourself but now the hope is lost 
 We in this together, this modern riot's holocaust 
 You the flame of the motherfuckin Molotov 
 You gotta keep your guard up, never ever let it down 
 Cause you never know when sneak attacks me back around 
 Some people like to take your kindness for weakness 
 So keep your privacy secret, the least you say - the better the defense 
 And try to keep a situation from every angle 
 So you can get a handle before you'll get dismantled by scandal 
 And best remember pure evil comes with seductive smiles 
 You might be sleeping with the enemy, stuck in denial 
 That those as trust will hurt you the most and after a while 
 You seek the truth called the shining, through so dark and survive 
 Their hearts are frozen, exposing their true nature, the behaterring 
 And nothing more than the wolf posing inside of sheeps' clothing 
 There's no surrender, never homie, at any cost 
 You've always got yourself when all the hope is lost 
 We in this together, this modern riot's holocaust 
 You the flame of the motherfuckin Molotov 
 There's no surrender, never homie, at any cost 
 You've always got yourself but now the hope is lost 
 We in this together, this modern riot's holocaust 
 You the flame of the motherfuckin Molotov 
 I know these verses all pain you but grim reality 
 And seeming seeding with negativity but in actuality 
 These analogies derive from catastrophes 
 Such blasphemies that have attacked and happened, they have happened to me 
 Just passing down some wisdom, beware of narcissism 
 I'm intertwined but volatile by the we've all grown organisms 
 Better known as human beings, you can't trust nobody 
 It seems these bottom feeders always tryina be feeding off hopes and dreams 
 But maybe we can change as a society 
 And try to make lighter things that challenge our camaraderie 
 I'd like to think the best of every person 
 But it seems so self-defeating when the greed is still alive and lurkin 
 We got to stop the hurtin', the reach for higher learning 
 Only they can be advanced and try to recover from burning 
 Each other in every hovel, possible but we can 
 But until then, until then, until then 
 There's no surrender, never homie, at any cost 
 You've always got yourself when all the hope is lost 
 We in this together, this modern riot's holocaust 
 You the flame of the motherfuckin Molotov 
 There's no surrender, never homie, at any cost 
 You've always got yourself but now the hope is lost 
 We in this together, this modern riot's holocaust 
 You the flame of the motherfuckin Molotov... 
 Of the motherfuckin Molotov... 
 Of the motherfuckin Molotov... 
 The motherfuckin Molotov... 
 Of the motherfuckin Molotov...
