(Prozak) 
 Little too late now they be trying to take all that evil back 
 Got a feeling this is the season to reap a harvest 
 And karma always snaps harder when it's coming from your own hand 
 Hit you like a fist knocks your soul down in quick sand 
 Here we go, animals are dying by the thousands and 
 This fool, we're starting to plan on building subsidized housing 
 Overpopulation is breaking the same as crime and 
 Decreasing of our supplies 
 Global warming climb and rising 
 Tell me where do we go when nothing's left 
 Nowhere to run such a mess 
 Nowhere to hide such a distress 
 Poisonous air takes your breath 
 GMOs watch it grow 
 Corporation cash flow 
 What's the goal I don't know 
 Mind control I suppose 
 They gotta go, nowhere to turn 
 And the sky turns black and the fires burn 
 And the oceans flood and overturns 
 Nowhere, nowhere to run 
 (Prozak) 
 Sea levels rising 
 Peace sells, who's buyin' 
 Prison cells full volume 
 Chemtrails, who's flyin' 
 Infidel stealthbombers NSA Al Qaeda 
 NRA ricochet bombs away wild fires 
 Terrorism airliners TSA soul bias 
 Phone taps drone attacks 
 Politicians all liars 
 Look on the bright side 
 But wait which side is brighter 
 They been looking awful dark to me I don't know which is lighter 
 Closed eyes, closed minds no one seems to mind that 
 We're running out of time 
 Last call we're checking out and 
 From where I'm sitting hard to say 
 We don't deserve it and 
 I'm not preaching, I'm just as guilty as you man 
 Nobody is perfect 
 (Prozak) 
 Let's change the ending, preventing this whole impending doom and 
 Stop ourselves from descending right into our eternal tombs and 
 Quit consuming everything and save a little room 
 For future generations yet to come so they don't run on fumes and 
 Leave behind some guidance instead of just violence 
 All we gotta do is reach inside of us and then we'll surely find it 
 Love understanding intelligence all irrelevant 
 The ever mystic continue the world's development
