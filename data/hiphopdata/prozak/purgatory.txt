Afterlife deserved 
 Is it really real anyway? 
 Wish I could find a better way 
 That I would lay me down 
 And give my life to you 
 There's nothing left to do 
 The inner story, the purgatory 
 What does it all mean? 
 (Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko) 
 The Good Book says and I don't really think they be wolfin' and if you already get tooken 
 I shook those fears, and I don't really believe and I should, and now the book got me lookin' 
 Seem like some all types of hopes, folks, copes and what they lovin' the most (the most) 
 I had the weirdest dreams and guttural screams and demons were seen from coast to coast 
 (Breathe) for the last time, sniff as if you deserve it 
 (Believe) if you don't know by now, you just made it real permanent 
 (Sleep) inside the golden gate, somewhere everyone hates you 
 (Please) ain't no savin', no face or nowhere to escape to 
 Eyes is wide shut but I gotta go visit 
 The automatism, the vision inside of my gut 
 Life is like "what?!", whatever you make it 
 Don't waste it 'fore your time is up till the peace of you 
 That you can see knee deep, tryna sweep 'em 
 Keep 'em from peepin' you 
 And when the streetsweep keep 
 (?All the deep sleep blinkin' you?) 
 Sinkin' 'em, ain't nobody speak of you 
 And that's purgatory! 
 (Chorus: Krizz Kaliko) 
 Afterlife deserved 
 Is it really real anyway? 
 Wish I could find a better way 
 That I would lay me down 
 And give my life to you 
 There's nothing left to do 
 The inner story, the purgatory 
 What does it all mean? 
 (Verse 2: Prozak) 
 Imagine a place that is darker than anything 
 That you have ever seen 
 The Earth is infected with evil in people 
 There is no vaccine 
 Baptized in blood, it's too late for repentance 
 The rapture is here 
 Surrounded by flames and the smoke through the portal 
 The devil appears 
 Screams can be heard at the Valley of Death 
 As the torture begins 
 The judgment is poured on behalf of our Lord 
 We shall pay for our sins 
 Nothing to do but to suffer, eternity 
 Screaming in pain 
 Tortured by demons and minions from hell 
 As they're praising his name 
 Please God, help me understand this plan 
 From this planet of madness 
 I try to walk the right path in this world inhabited by savage malice 
 I take a look inside but what I find behind my eyes is eternal sadness 
 I'm begging for forgiveness, Father, I don't wanna perish 
 Let me rise from the ashes 
 (Chorus: Krizz Kaliko) 
 Afterlife deserved 
 Is it really real anyway? 
 Wish I could find a better way 
 That I would lay me down 
 And give my life to you 
 There's nothing left to do 
 The inner story, the purgatory 
 What does it all mean? 
 (Verse 3: Tech N9ne) 
 You cannot even see a movie 
 Without the thought of a killer comin' to get you with the uzi 
 And you don't even know the killer but he hit you with the tooley 
 And murdered many more, the motive made is the man is moody 
 And who is the one to shoot him? He is, indeed his 
 Mother should've murdered him as a fetus and beat his 
 Ass with his cleated Adidas 
 Jillian and Mayci are deleted now we live defeated! 
 Crooked cops is puttin' niggas in boxes 
 I watch this on the telly, every day a synopsis 
 Double cross this, really silly to pop quick 
 And not get caught with the prejudice for the chocolate 
 Caustic, burnin' so many right as the Glock spit or talked then he lost it 
 STOP IT! All I was yellin' till last cough it was chalk shit no hospice! 
 The homeless, the onus is on us 
 Get blown up by the enemy and damn, it hurts 
 A stronger aroma of grown guts 
 Then bone dust, for infinity we damned at birth, handed dirt 
 A natural disaster, Kill 'em all in the churches 
 The man at work? 
 But is the one working God or Satan? 
 Awakened in purgatory, people, welcome to planet Earth! 
 (Chorus: Krizz Kaliko) 
 Afterlife deserved 
 Is it really real anyway? 
 Wish I could find a better way 
 That I would lay me down 
 And give my life to you 
 There's nothing left to do 
 The inner story, the purgatory 
 What does it all mean?
