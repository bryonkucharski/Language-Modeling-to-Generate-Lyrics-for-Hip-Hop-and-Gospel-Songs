Did it ever occur to you that I'm not your enemy? 
 So tell me how the hell you became my nemesis? 
 Why do you harbor so much hate inside? 
 Seem to be so full of anger simply 'cause I exist 
 But if you ever consider the emptiness in your soul 
 To be the side effect of your own design 
 Perhaps your insecurities will get the best of you 
 And all of this exist only inside your mind 
 So tell me why we 
 All just hurt each other 
 Why we fuck each other 
 Why we tear each other apart 
 Your transparence is tearing me apart at the seams and 
 I can't help but staring through you void of personality 
 You're like a mass without substance 
 You wear a mask to disguise your attempts of blatant commonality 
 Your true colors leak from your pores and 
 It's the darkest shade of grey I feel that anybody's ever seen 
 Your envy isn't good at pretend'n 
 It's only making it more obvious for everyone to see 
 So tell me why we 
 All just hurt each other 
 Why we fuck each other 
 Why we tear each other apart 
 Self destruction, you are the catalyst 
 So hard to function adversary inside a mist 
 And my assumption is your reason to manifest 
 The inner ambush engage until there's nothing left 
 You're always there inside of me guiding me further from the light it seems 
 Despite of my cries to let me live in peace 
 And there's just gotta be a way to get you outta me but honestly it's ...
