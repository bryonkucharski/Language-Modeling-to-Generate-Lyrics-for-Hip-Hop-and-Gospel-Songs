Much like wind, blowing through hallowed cemetery grounds 
 We all circulate within this void of reality, in search of something more profound 
 Hopes and dreams fuel our will to live, projecting our desires into the universe 
 And awaiting what it gives 
 Through our lifes journey you will encounter saints as well as the heartless 
 But remember, in order to appreciate the light, one must spend time 
 In darkness
