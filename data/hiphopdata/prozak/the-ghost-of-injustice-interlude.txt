Although they attempt to hide the events of the past, 
 Their are no lies large enough to conceal or subtract. 
 Indeed blood on the hands may quickly wash away, 
 However the wound's inflicted are eternal, forever to stay. 
 The ghost of injustice spreads fear and promotes, 
 A vicious malignant entity we have long since awoke. 
 The choices are simple, remove the bandage and repair. 
 Or continue to keep infected with more lie's and despair.
