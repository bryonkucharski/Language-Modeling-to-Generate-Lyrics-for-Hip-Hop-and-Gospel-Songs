When we all fall down 
 When we all fall down 
 I feel like ever single second's the same 
 It's sort of like suffocating under the reigns of Satan's chainss 
 That maintain, it's a damn shame how we all fall 
 Like rain drops on brick walls and simply fade away 
 Into the memories of yesterday 
 And when there's no one left to remember the human race shall cast away 
 Inside this vast abyss of disarray 
 Instantly viciously and in a moment's notice become history 
 And while this anxiety is piling high in me 
 I am screaming in silence on the outside disguising as calmly 
 Contemplating the irony why would He 
 Create a race so violently refusing to reside in harmony 
 Constantly cussing clamaty, greed and vanity 
 Proceed into deceive each other and destroy humanity 
 Savage mechanical ravaging families scandalizes 
 Cussing these agonies while planing these mass catastrophes 
 Wanna be somebody someday somehow someway 
 Some pray we can make it to a better day 
 We got to save face change fate embrace change brake chains 
 Try to turn the page before it's too late 
 Headed for rock bottom as the clock's counting 
 Descending like stocks and bonds, falling like leaves in autumn 
 We are brought up products by the heartless for economical harvest 
 Illuminati remain an anonymous block of the economics the end is upon us 
 I promise just looking for silence 
 Some comfort to something to help occupy these final hours 
 A temporary sabotical from these animals 
 That chew us and consume us like rapid ravaging cannibals 
 Mechanical mammals with amo wearing camo their mind is so narrow 
 Death and destruction is the only scenario 
 Straight to the burial bombs are dropping form areas 
 Their motivations are the only compensation of materials 
 And this planet we've attacked with our habits 
 Is in the saddest state from falling from grace since we've inhabited 
 Such a disgrace we became a race that's complacent 
 Ungrateful, and wasteful and hateful shameful savages 
 Wanna be somebody someday somehow someway 
 Some pray we can make it to a better day 
 We got to save face change fate embrace change brake chains 
 Try to turn the page before it's too late
