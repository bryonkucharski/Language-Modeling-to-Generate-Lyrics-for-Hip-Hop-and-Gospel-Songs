(Hate) It's in everyone I know 
 It follows everywhere I go 
 Carefully take control 
 All this hate inside you (hate) 
 It's living inside of you, this ferocious monster 
 Your catalyst, your nemesis stop the ganger imposter 
 Eating at your conscious, subliminally filling your head with nonsense 
 Evil ambience, while we're spreading level in content 
 Pulling on your strings like a puppeteer 
 Got you punked with fear, and it's so sincere 
 When the devils creeps near, and he speaks in your ear 
 When he sneaks in your mind, body, soul disapears (hate) 
 And maybe one day we will come overcome this circumference 
 Whole circle of violence and exchange it for silos or somethin' 
 Meanwhile the blood is still runnin' 
 Nation kills nation, brother kills brother 
 Often for nothing more than self dominance over one another 
 Mother earth is ready to shake us off the fault lines 
 We gotta look into ourselfs see where the fault lays 
 We gotta tryin' stick together in these dark times 
 Ancient revelations come to life inside these dark rhymes 
 Somehow it stays ingrain in us, that's ain't enough 
 That we maiming, murder each other it stays the same ain't no giving up 
 Hate is such a primitive, simple emotion 
 Yet its blindly followed by billion of simpletons with silent devotion 
 From coast to coast and ocean to ocean 
 I get the notion like their forcing hate down on the throat 
 Like potent poisonous potion distracting us from everything 
 And attackin' us from the back it seems 
 It's slashing us right at the steams 
 And never look back and laugh at our dreams (hate) 
 We gotta try to conquer this remaining optimism 
 Before the words mankind and extinction become anonymous 
 What's a worth then? When there's nothing left 
 Absence on life with cold silence in your chest 
 Full of nothing but rigor mortis and regret 
 Only wishing you could witness another sunset 
 A brutal world full of tortured souls with non rest 
 Planet earth is a deadly game of chess full of (hate)
