Half angel, half devil 
 Half man, half beast 
 Half love, half hate 
 Half war, half peace 
 You'd better pray to God and hope that He will walk beside you 
 Cause in your darkest hour the reaper is sure to find you 
 Half angel, half devil 
 Half man, half beast 
 Half love, half hate 
 Half war, half peace 
 You'd better pray to God and hope that He will walk beside you 
 Cause in your darkest hour the reaper is sure to find you 
 (Verse 1: Prozak) 
 I never asked for it 
 Chosen to be the chosen one to gather souls of those 
 Chosen to become post-mortem 
 To live or damn eternal fates of the wrong 
 Either embrace by heaven's fate, or enslaved by Satan's throne 
 I've gone by many names, pronounced with screams of pain 
 I've walked through valleys of dark and embarked through hell's flames 
 Such a shame that in the end I am all you have left 
 Now draw your last breath, hello, my name is death 
 The only thing that's certain 
 I guarantee to each and every person 
 Here through the curtains and I'll be there lurkin' 
 A predator with man 
 I'm forced to enforce the course of nature 
 Provided by omnipotent plans 
 These hands are so callous from years of such malice 
 Sir fear is thy power, severe but must balance 
 Adhere to my talent, some here you must vanish 
 Time for one's loved one to drink from thy chalice 
 Half angel, half devil 
 Half man, half beast 
 Half love, half hate 
 Half war, half peace 
 You'd better pray to God and hope that He will walk beside you 
 Cause in your darkest hour the reaper is sure to find you 
 Half angel, half devil 
 Half man, half beast 
 Half love, half hate 
 Half war, half peace 
 You'd better pray to God and hope that He will walk beside you 
 Cause in your darkest hour the reaper is sure to find you 
 (Verse 2: Prozak) 
 It never ceases to amaze me 
 Witness them screaming and carry on when I come for their 
 Babies 
 Or mothers, fathers, brothers, daughters 
 Husbands, wives, uncles, slaughter 
 I just do what I'm supposed to 
 But yet you feel the need to plead 
 When you see my shadow's amongst you 
 You pray for forgiveness, perhaps a second chance 
 I do not speak your language, why must you even ask 
 Your body fills with Paralysis 
 Your eyes open wide, and pupils dilate with self-analysis 
 So just relax and let it go 
 Let the rings of fate delegate responsibility of your souls 
 And it's over now, your soul has reached its destination 
 And it's funny how you're at the gates of hell 
 But yet your body's underground 
 And deafening silence always seems to be the only sound 
 As you're descending down 
 Half angel, half devil 
 Half man, half beast 
 Half love, half hate 
 Half war, half peace 
 You'd better pray to God and hope that He will walk beside you 
 Cause in your darkest hour the reaper is sure to find you 
 Half angel, half devil 
 Half man, half beast 
 Half love, half hate 
 Half war, half peace 
 You'd better pray to God and hope that He will walk beside you 
 Cause in your darkest hour the reaper is sure to find you 
 Ye though I walk through the valley of a shadow of death, thou shalt fear no evil, for Thou art with me, Thy rod and Thy staff - shalt comfort me
