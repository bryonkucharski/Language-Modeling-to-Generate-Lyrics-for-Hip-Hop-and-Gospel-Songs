Hold up, bitch, I'm holding a four fifty 
 You'll sure get your whole body throat sliv 
 With a switch blade you'll get your whole throat slit 
 You better watch your mouth because you know who I roll with 
 I'm not talking about this rap shit, I'm talking about this gat shit 
 When I see your soul, I'ma snatch it 
 Fuck around and end up inside of a casket 
 I'll brace them like Jason Voorhees with a hatchet 
 Some people think I need some help, but I'm way past it 
 Locked in a padded cell, screaming with a straight jacket 
 I'm haunted by several spirits of dead poets 
 I think I'm Edgar Allen Poe, but I don't know it 
 So don't quote it, I'm not sure who even wrote it 
 At three A.M. my hands become possessed, I can't control it 
 It writes murder confessions from past times 
 And subliminal messages that I hide inside my rhymes 
 Hey man, why you talking so tough 
 No, for real, you be playing too much 
 And it's all fun and games until somebody goes nuts 
 Until somebody gets stuck with my blade in they guts 
 Did I fail to mention, I'm manic depressive, obsessive compulsive 
 Psychotic man that craves attention with a Smith and Wesson 
 Hit your chest and I'm hoping you learned your lesson 
 Grab your vest and better count your blessings 
 Because we're mid western, bitch you're in a western 
 They call me John Wayne, shoot them up like Jesse James 
 Insane in the brain, like my homies Cypress Hill 
 Drugged out, thugged out, pop some pills, cock the still 
 Shit, you want to ask me if this glock is real 
 With just one pull of this trigger you're in hell and now you're out of here 
 You're whole existence just disappeared 
 Like Nostradamus I promise the end is near 
 I thought it sounded just like comets through out the hemisphere 
 It makes you vomit like gin and tonic or everclear 
 Some people think I'm psychotic for talking to the mirror 
 But I blame it on the narcotics that put me here 
 Hey man, why you talking so tough 
 No, for real, you be playing too much 
 And it's all fun and games until somebody goes nuts 
 Until somebody gets stuck with my blade in they guts
