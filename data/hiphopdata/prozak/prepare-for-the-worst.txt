[Hook - Prozak]: 
 You gotta, hope for the best, prepare for the worst 
 It's never over till you're rollin' all alone inside that hearse 
 And there's, one life, one death, one path that's yours 
 So run fast, full blast, kick back them doors 
 (X2) 
 [Verse 1 - Prozak]: 
 I know sometimes your mental state will try to misguide you 
 Mislead you into thinkin' that you've got the devil right beside you 
 Perhaps you're thinking you're sinkin' 
 And slowly slippin' by misguided intuition 
 Which is one more part of inhibitions (?) 
 You've got to be yourself no matter what the cost 
 And if others don't like it 
 Tell those player haters just to (fuck off!) 
 Don't waste your time on pettiness or petty people 
 See they wanna spread evil to make up for the fact that ____ people 
 You've got to rise above 'em; take them with a grain of salt 
 Never subscribe to negativity, homie assume the force 
 And imitation is the greatest form of flattery 
 That's how I've been rappin' for 10 years; 
 And kept my sanity! 
 [Verse 2 - Prozak]: 
 Them people are afraid of things that they don't understand 
 So never take it personal, just try to be the bigger man 
 I hope you find some inspiration from this song 
 That you can take away from, maybe you can break free from these limitations 
 It's all inside your head, and if you think about it 
 When you know that you're the shit 
 There ain't nothing no one can say about it 
 Keep that ego to a minimal, try to stay respectful 
 Not cynical, this is critical, stay original 
 There's no respect for an imitation, carbon copy 
 And never take for granted friends or family, man, or become sloppy 
 These are the words to live by, when you're an artist 
 And maybe one day you will understand it, when you're the hardest emcee
