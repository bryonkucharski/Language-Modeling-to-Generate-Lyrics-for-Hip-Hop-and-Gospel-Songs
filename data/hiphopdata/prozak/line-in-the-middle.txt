(Hook x4: Prozak) 
 On your headstone, there will be two dates 
 All that matters is that line in the middle 
 (Verse 1 : Monoxide of Twiztid) 
 Now that I've been crossed out 
 That line in the middle says nothing 'bout the time 
 Rewind and find issues, that I once would hide 
 Like a waistline pistol 
 Now why should I confide in a system when I could kill ya' 
 La Familia, photolyzed my mind like Sid Samilia 
 I keep it underground like that black market memorabilia 
 You lookin' for darkness? Well I'm your dealer 
 You spit that limelight then I don't feel ya' 
 I make that little hair stand up when I'm near ya' 
 My motto is fuck being left there to fear ya' 
 Even if you can't see yourself in the mirror 
 (Verse 2 : Madrox of Twiztid) 
 Born on date and expiration 
 And in between those goals and expectations 
 My word's across the world in syndication 
 And products available for purchase in every nation 
 Listen man I bet a man neither one of them can 
 Prepare for the drive and wrote that I possessed with any callers 
 And they call it no window from losers vantage point 
 But like the core I just teach us we gonn' rock this from detroit 
 We gonn' sharpen it up to a point and then jam it up in they eye 
 It ain't about being dead it's what you do before you die 
 Only get one life to live it could be gone before you blink 
 Either rise above the situation or close your eyes and sink 
 To the depths of the dark, beneath the dirt and the ground 
 Where conversations take place forever without a single sound 
 No words can be heard just the mold of uncertainty 
 From the past on the search of the life that used to be 
 (Verse 3 : Prozak) 
 Life is short you better cherish it, before you perish it 
 And it's inherited your lungs will have no air in it 
 So don't be scared of it it's imperative to be carried to the cemetery 
 By chariot and buried a bit 
 So make the most of these moments before you coast closer to comatose 
 And tossed over to death's corner 
 You feel the hand on your shoulder, that black mask comin' for ya' 
 It's getting colder and colder here comes the coroner 
 You'll be hellbound, demons keep you held down 
 Sins will leave you spellbound, best to keep your head down 
 Just an empty shell now, nothing's left but hell's hounds 
 Chasing you through hell's grounds, place you in a cell now 
 Hands bound 
 And it is certain the final close of the curtain is lurking 
 And always looking to submerge you in the dirt 
 And it's urgent that you reserve a purpose for service 
 Upon this earth that is worthy and worth a birth 
 And you will be worthless
