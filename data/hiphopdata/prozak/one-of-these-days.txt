(Intro: Tech N9ne) 
 I ain't bout to no dubs or chairs or nothin' 
 This is real spill right here 
 Just one track 
 (Verse One: Tech N9ne) 
 One of these days I'mma grow up and stop gettin' toe up 
 One of these days I'mma blow up and show up plush 
 One day I'm really gonna go up chuck 
 I'm low, just stuck, cause lately it ain't no luck fuck 
 It's like my dough cut up the fact that I blow buck sucks 
 I need some more ducks to fold up and hold up stuff 
 I'mma roll up, what, some y (o) ellow stuff 
 Par for me, no rust, and no crust, I'm a sure nuf bust 
 One of these days fans are gonna blow up Kutt 
 Won't be anymore hush hush, about doin' our show, just trust 
 And that statements cause of they no nough rush to go get my flow cuss ready amongst they soul duck us 
 I'm swole up, cause a hold just struck. Friggin IRS at my address, I'm ready to throw knucks up 
 One of these days I'mma go nuts, what, like right now this life styles 'cause it's so rough and tough 
 (Hook: Krizz Kaliko) 
 One of these days, I'll find what I'm lookin' for 
 And I won't look no more 
 I'll say out loud that I'm here now 
 I walk on holy ground 
 One of these days, my life won't hold me down 
 One of these days. Ya, one of these days 
 (Verse Two: Prozak) 
 Yo 
 One of these days, I'll be comfortable in my own skin 
 Happy with what I have 
 Happy with who I am 
 Accept the things I can not change, and change the things I can 
 Achieve the wisdom to conquer these struggles from within 
 One of these days, I'm gonna forgive my enemies 
 Release these grudges and negative energies and just set it free 
 Life is to short for this baggage that attacks and then inhabits, like a savage monkey on your back that is ragged and rabid 
 One of these days I'mma undo all the bad that I've done 
 Correct the karma and try to make right by everyone 
 Every bridge I burned, trust me the lessons learned 
 Still dealin' with these previous grievances that I've earned 
 One of these days I'll be buried and gone, all that will remain are the lyrics and vocals and hopes contained in this song 
 Life's about the path you have chosen that's gotch you hopin to get on through the door while it's still open, it's closin. One of these days.inhabits 
 (Hook: Krizz Kaliko) 
 One of these days, I'll find what I'm lookin' for 
 And I won't look no more 
 I'll say out loud that I'm here now 
 I walk on holy ground 
 One of these days, my life won't hold me down 
 One of these days. Ya, one of these days 
 (Verse Three: Krizz Kaliko) 
 I wanna be a millionaire so fuckin' bad (Forget about it) 
 But I should be thankful for the things that I have (You can live without it) 
 One of these days I'll get some plaques on the wall 
 Never be hated. Be rated one of the best of them all 
 Greatest of all times, play this in my mind about a million times before when I say this in my rhyme 
 Never know when it's time to go (K) 
 One of these days I'll get my spirit right, lyrics like I'm livin' right. When you hear it you hear what I fear at night (OK) 
 One of these days I'll pay a bill when it's due 
 They messin with you, if you just owe a few to their revenue (OK) 
 Get off this emotional roller coaster I been riding 
 Live life to the fullest cause every day you keep on dyin' 
 One of these days you won't see my vitiligo, and people will stop starrin' where I go 
 One of these days 
 (Hook: Kirzz kaliko) 
 One of these days, I'll find what I'm lookin' for 
 And I won't look no more 
 I'll say out loud that I'm here now 
 I walk on holy ground 
 One of these days, my life won't hold me down 
 One of these days. Yeah, one of these days
