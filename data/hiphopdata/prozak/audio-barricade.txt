People tell me that I never really smile maybe 
 If they knew me ever since I was a child baby 
 Understanding the reason for my withdrawal baby 
 It's been worse than it has in a long while 
 You see my brain just thinks a lot 
 Often lost in thought 
 Often spaced I just cannot 
 Seem to get it together been losing my patience a lot 
 Hope for the better whatever anything to make it stop 
 If you're feeling like me then you'll understand 
 And if you don't I apologize in advance 
 But on the other hand 
 I don't really give a damn 
 Take it or leave it, I am who I am 
 Just another person trying to find his way 
 Trying to figure it out trying to find my place 
 Either lead, follow or get out of the way 
 Life is too short, too fast to turn the page 
 Turn the page

 Sometimes I really think I'm losing it 
 I don't really know what I would do without the therapy of music 
 Therapeutic no substituting 
 Can't erase the pain but sure help subdue it 
 Helps me to get through 
 Dismiss my issues 
 Gives me a lift to a place that's less blue 
 Sorta like a force field that protects you 
 Audio barricade I suggest you 
 Turn it up a little louder 
 When you feeling lonesome 
 When you feeling down some 
 When you really feeling like you hit rock bottom 
 And nothing to break your fall but more problems 
 And all the walls seem to close in on you 
 Nothing but darkness to fall upon you 
 Feels like all is lost everything around you 
 The sun will rise again you gotta push onward 
 Push onward

 Every time I look around I can't help but 
 Pray for something or someone to save us 
 From our own ways that seem to plague us 
 From the dawn of time our hate is contagious 
 All we really gotta do is live and let live 
 Enjoy the ride of all that exists man and that's it 
 Kinda simple ain't it? So why complicate it? 
 With all the bullshit and games that people playin' 
 If they wanna make their own graze let them lay in it, 
 All I'm trying to say is don't create your own pain 
 Otherwise you'll be the one to blame and that's being honest 
 Another lame brain maybe you're walking around us 
 Every day can be a new day if you let it 
 Try to focus on the positive and not the nega- 
 Tive nonsense I'm just saying let it 
 Go far by the wayside so many 
 People trying to bring you down 
 They drag you to the bottom then they try to watch you drown 
 And pretending to be friends but yet somehow 
 Always a reason to run they mouth 
 So jealous 
 So jealous

 Turn it up watch it 
 All just go away 
 Turn it up watch it 
 All just fade away 
 Turn it up watch it 
 All just go away 
 Turn it up watch it 
 All just fade away
