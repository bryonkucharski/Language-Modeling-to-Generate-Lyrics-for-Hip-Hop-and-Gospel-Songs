If it's hate that you speak 
 (Go to hell!) 
 And if you prey upon the weak 
 (Go to hell!) 
 Spreadin' lies and deceits 
 (Go to hell!) 
 Eternal flames, feel the heats 
 (Go to hell!) 
 And if you cannot make amends 
 (Go to hell!) 
 And if you follow every trend 
 (Go to hell!) 
 And if you back stab your friends 
 (Go to hell!) 
 If you ain't down till the end 
 (Go to hell!) 
 The chosen one, the wicked son, they call Hitchcock 
 Talk some shit and I'ma hit you with this quick block 
 Body parts are scattered and sealed up in ziplocks 
 With my steel cats get ill'd up to six blocks 
 You can try to run away but you won't get far 
 They call me Prozak, BITCH!, the knight of Templar 
 I'll open up your brain like the Deathstar 
 And lyrics come to me like ghosts from the graveyard 
 Since my birth I've been obsessed with the dead 
 Homocidal thoughts while I was bein' breast fed 
 I tried to kill myself but I survived instead 
 From pieces of a broken mirror, sliced my wrists, bled 
 Shit, my wicked rhymes will have you overdose 
 I'll leave your ass comatose 
 You try to play me close I'll levitate the smoke 
 When I hit the fuckin' stage be like, "What's that smell?" 
 Sulfer and brimstone BITCH, go to hell 
 If it's hate that you speak 
 (Go to hell!) 
 And if you pray upon the weak 
 (Go to hell!) 
 Spreadin' lies and deceits 
 (Go to hell!) 
 Eternal flames, feel the heats 
 (Go to hell!) 
 And if you cannot make amends 
 (Go to hell!) 
 And if you follow every trend 
 (Go to hell!) 
 And if you back stab your friends 
 (Go to hell!) 
 If you ain't down till the end 
 (Go to hell!) 
 They call me Hitchcock 
 The radios afraid to play my wicked paragraphs 
 Go to the station lock and load up on they whole staff 
 And let them know the danger of us crossin' paths 
 And let it be known that I spit the truth like a polygraph 
 So jot it down homie, copy that 
 There's always room for another carbon copycat 
 They tried to run with my style but I got it back 
 It's hard to sound just like me with your head in half 
 (Go to hell!) 
 If it's hate that you speak 
 (Go to hell!) 
 And if you pray upon the weak 
 (Go to hell!) 
 Spreadin' lies and deceits 
 (Go to hell!) 
 Eternal flames, feel the heats 
 (Go to hell!) 
 And if you cannot make amends 
 (Go to hell!) 
 And if you follow every trend 
 (Go to hell!) 
 And if you back stab your friends 
 (Go to hell!) 
 If you ain't down till the end 
 (Go to hell!)
