Motherfuck you 
 Straight up fuck you 
 Double fuck you 
 Bitch fuck you 
 I want this anthem for those who can't find em 
 For them industry [?] who don't know talent from (?) 
 Becoming obvious that they've been plotting on us 
 Tryna stop us from accomplishing profiting dollars that are ours 
 We underground man, we do it ten times harder 
 Hella shows, payin' dues we true to life artist 
 Hustle mentality with confidence to [?] 
 Straight to the top, defy gravity to reach furthest 
 It's in my blood like a deadly venomous element 
 And I've accapted it look into my eyes it's evident 
 Each and every sentences further to rappin' instead 
 I've been earnin', deservin' every single chance that I get 
 And I can't help it if you're hatin' homie 
 Let me tell you this: 
 I'm one of the hardest rap artists to lyrics when I spit 
 My work ethic is set on to everybody admits 
 So if you're talkin' shit on me then you can suck on my dick bitch 
 (Fuck you!) To major labels and their whole stuff 
 (Bitch fuck you!) To the radio, kiss my ass 
 (Motherfuck you!) To the people doubting my craft 
 (Straight up you!) For thinkin' you can witness me crashed 
 (Double fuck you!) To the haters off in the past 
 (I'm like fuck you!) Sneaky little snakes in the grass 
 (Never trust you!) Prayin' that I'm comin' in last 
 Carefull throwin' all them rocks when you're livin' in glass 
 The heart of an artits is often the hardest to damage 
 So careless from being rubbish' (?) is shape shifts to granted 
 All you want is to be heard to strike a nerve 
 Despite the obsticles that are spiting you with each and every curve 
 It's a paradox a literal pandora's box 
 You often give up everything, regardless if they care or not 
 And they being all them people in charts 
 CEO's, major labels sittin', watchin' you starve 
 They're turning ringtone rappers in the national stars 
 And makes you mad as hell, smashin' knuckles to scars 
 While billboard keeps on grindin' for them phonies at large 
 Is got crawling in your skin while they're claiming them charts 
 And it's never been about the talent 
 It's all about the who'se paying and who will management 
 Cause who you are is who you know and that is adamant 
 To be successful and relevant, that's the end of it 
 Fuck 'em I say "to hell with it" 
 (Fuck you!) To major labels and their whole stuff 
 (Bitch fuck you!) To the radio, kiss my ass 
 (Motherfuck you!) To the people doubting my craft 
 (Straight up you!) For thinkin' you can witness me crashed 
 (Double fuck you!) To the haters off in the past 
 (I'm like fuck you!) Sneaky little snakes in the grass 
 (Never trust you!) Prayin' that I'm comin' in last 
 Carefull throwin' all them rocks when you're livin' in glass 
 Strictly independent, gorilla hustle underground rap phenomene 
 I never backdown and I'm back on with the vengeance 
 The snake and bat has got my back with each and every sentence 
 I keep on grindin' and rhymin' it right every second 
 Supplying divine lines from my ol' mic, check it 
 You look surprised to find 'em alive but I'm not stressin' 
 I won't comply to your lies and can't try pride aggression 
 And did I mention? It's all karma and it's right from the wine 
 Sorta like Mike Tyson I fight night 
 I'm hyped till I fight for mine 
 The truth hurts like a knife, like a spike in the spine 
 And thanks to the talking, you for helping me shine 
 (Fuck you!) To major labels and their whole stuff 
 (Bitch fuck you!) To the radio, kiss my ass 
 (Motherfuck you!) To the people doubting my craft 
 (Straight up you!) For thinkin' you can witness me crashed 
 (Double fuck you!) To the haters off in the past 
 (I'm like fuck you!) Sneaky little snakes in the grass 
 (Never trust you!) Prayin' that I'm comin' in last 
 Carefull throwin' all them rocks when you're livin' in glass
