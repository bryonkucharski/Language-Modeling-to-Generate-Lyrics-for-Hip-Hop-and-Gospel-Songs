This can is slick 
 Man he thinks I didn't notice 
 My girlfriend's on her cellphone texting 
 It's all envocus now 
 Supposed to be my best friend in 7 years 
 And now I think about it all week long 
 My bitch was acting weird 
 My first impulse: to the kill 'em right now 
 Chop his body into pieces and place 'em in hollowed ground 
 Fuck it, I'll get 'em at the same time 
 Someone's suspecting 
 They'll never ever see this coming 
 The dots connecting 
 Had to head home and get ready 
 Got work at 5 o'clock 
 Man I hope she isn't there, 'cause boy I swear to God 
 I don't know if I can restrain 
 This anger that's in my brain 
 This hatred is pumping faster than nitrosolvent in my veins 
 I gotta chill, relax, try to keep it cool 
 'Cause revenge is best revolved when you have 'em play the rules 
 Drive home and grab my uniform and gave her a smirk and said 
 "I love you baby girl and I will see you when I'm home from work" 
 Fear 
 Panic 
 Betrayel 
 Nervous 
 Careful what you find when you dig below the surface 
 You might lose you mind from the pain that it brings 
 And who can you trust when life ain't what it seems? 
 Left the crip, the first stop hit up a liquor store 
 I grabbed a fifth of Jack and a pack of smokes 
 Like tunnel vision I kept driving in the days 
 Can't believe I'm just finding out, huh 
 Today of all days 
 This can't be real I'm getting sick to my stomach 
 The more I think, the more I drink, shit I think I'ma vomit 
 Retaliation's on my mind, everything's getting scary 
 Just to think, just to spring we was gonna get married 
 Damn I know this must sound crazy but I think that I still love her 
 This can't be what it seems man that dude is like my brother 
 Maybe I should just head home, have it out and just confront her 
 But no communication, we could just misread each other 
 This anxiety's inside of me is a bottomless pit 
 Its idol be defiling me and now the bottom line is this 
 I gotta man up, stand up to get to the bottom of this 
 And speaking of bottoms I might as well be downing this fifth

 Driving through the neighborhood, now it won't be long 
 Turn up the radio and I'll be damned, they're playing our song 
 So serendipidous, this can't be just coincidence 
 Somewhere we lost our innocence, tonight we will rekindle this 
 So ridiculous to think she could betray 
 My first love, my first kiss, the mother of my baby 
 Maybe I'm just insecure of our relationship 
 I'm pulling up the block, what the fuck is this? 
 My homeboy's car is parked in front my house 
 They must have seen my pulling up and now they turn the lights out 
 I popped my trunk, grabbed my pistol, vision's in my head 
 I cocked the hammer back, yeah and all I seen was red 
 Bitch 
 Fucking whore 
 Bitch 
 'Sup you fucking bitch 
 Die you fucking whore! 
 Die! 
 What the motherfuck did you do? 
 It was supposed to be your surprise birthday party! 
 Oh I'm sorry!
