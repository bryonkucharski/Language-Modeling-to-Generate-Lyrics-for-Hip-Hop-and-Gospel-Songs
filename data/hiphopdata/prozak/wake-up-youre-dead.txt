It's no surprise now 
 Look at my eyes now 
 It's your demise now 
 Wake up you're dead! 
 It's on tonight bro 
 Two rivals will collide with assault rifles 
 Wake up you're dead! 
 This is the end game 
 No more pretending 
 Quick to remove your membrane 
 Wake up you're dead! 
 This was the last straw 
 And now it's last call 
 Fuck it let the body's fall 
 Wake up you're dead! 
 (Verse 1: Prozak) 
 I can't explain it to you 
 This hate that's in my blood 
 It runs as cold as ice through my vain's and my thoughts just flood 
 They take over my mentals with such a profile, lack of sentimental 
 Blinded by rage I'm vengeful, revenge for the mentals 
 Logic right out the window 
 Maniac right from the get-go 
 So tight I grip this pistol 
 So no more innuendos 
 So if we going to do it 
 Let's get to doing this 
 Spilling fluids 
 Including each other in ancient sacrifice like druids 
 Trust me you don't want to do it 
 You don't want to get in to it 
 I speak murder mighty fluent 
 (Can't control myself man) 
 If I put my mind to it 
 I can stop your time from moving 
 Leave your life in fucking ruins 
 (Shaking's in my hands again) 
 The voices in my head are getting louder 
 And continue to tell me to bring a lamb to slaughter 
 (Trust me you don't want that) 
 'Cause I might just snap and attack you 
 Snatch you and have you an what have you 
 Just to get it cracking 
 (With this baseball bat) 
 (Verse 2: Prozak) 
 We're some arch enemies 
 Like some superhero building comics 
 It seems our fate has brought us together homie we can't stop it 
 Survival of the fittest, prepare to finally finish 
 We're about to handle business 
 One on one leaving no witness 
 This hate submerges me 
 The urgency to hurt you see 
 Planning it perfectly 
 Disturbingly murder in the first degree 
 No amnesty savagely stabbithy cavitys 
 Causing a casualty casually 
 By causing me chaos and calamity 
 Every fiber in my being wants 
 To cease your heart from beating 
 Wants to stop your lungs from breathing 
 (I think I've lost my mind) 
 Don't let it be deceiving 
 My calm demeanor meaning I really want to leave you bleeding 
 (This rage has turned me blind) 
 And my aggression has turned in to quite an obsession 
 To teach you lessons with my weapons 
 (This is a battle ground) 
 I won't feel vindicated 
 Till you are eliminated disintegrated on pavement 
 (Put you right in to the ground) 
 (Verse 3: Prozak) 
 Seek and Destroy 
 Invite betrayal Deploy 
 Put him in holes 
 Bodies explode 
 Reload 
 Like a carnival cannibal 
 Red dragon like Hannibal 
 This rage so animal 
 Why can't I get a handle bro 
 Lost in a state of psychosis 
 I can barely focus 
 Just go for the throat full force and choke 
 And hope that it closes 
 But just remember you provoked this 
 And woke this ferocious beast 
 So take notice its about to swarm on you like some locus 
 I'm called upon so full of rage 
 Now all I see is red 
 Enemy time you wake up 
 Mother fucker you're dead
