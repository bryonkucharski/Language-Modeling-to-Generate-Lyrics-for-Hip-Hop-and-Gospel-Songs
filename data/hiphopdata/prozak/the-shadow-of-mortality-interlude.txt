Time is the avenger of ourselves and most of all 
 Things 
 Even from the point of conception 
 Death starts, where life begins 
 We exist in the shadows of our very own mortality 
 Spiritually growing, yet physically fading as the seconds pass in reality 
 A lifetime of emotions and experiences are acquired 
 Gathered seemingly for nothing, to waste away, and expire 
 Perhaps the greatest purpose is to only have lived 
 Just long enough to contribute... then pass it on, to the kids
