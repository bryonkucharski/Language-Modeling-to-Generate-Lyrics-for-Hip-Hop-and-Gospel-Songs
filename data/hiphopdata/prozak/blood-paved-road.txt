We stole this country from one race without a second glance 
 Then enslaved another race and forced them to harvest the land 
 Perhaps it's bad karma from the founding forefathers 
 This could be the cause of our problems that's coming back to haunt us 
 Our current state is tainted with AIDS and inflation 
 And other heinous things that plagues this over populated nation 
 Living in fear of terrorists leaving us clearly scared of our 
 Mirrored reflections appearing to be so nightmarish 
 Before we all perish can we get along and bear it? 
 Can we resolve and evolve from all the wrong we did inherit? 
 Or is it too late just accepting our true fate? 
 Never learning from the past mistakes while sending ourselves to a doomsday 
 On the blood paved road 
 We tell our lies 
 On the blood paved road 
 We can't survive 
 On the blood paved road 
 Advertising propaganda, it's driving us all bananas 
 We care more about the brands we wear instead of being aware 
 Of the issues that effect u, s constitution that protects us 
 Misdirection that infects us, petty things that keep us separate 
 It is now obvious we are Illuminati zombies surrounding the television 
 Hypnotized embodied submerged in commercialism 
 Perturbed by these euphemisms disturbing these organisms 
 Consumed with consumerism 
 It's a never-ending cycle and we seem to feel entitled 
 To treat each other quite spitefully 
 Social media idols and diva's attention seeking heathens 
 What a tangled web were weaving total state of disbelieving 
 Toward the edge we keep receding 
 Hey, let me ask you this: can we put a stop to this? 
 Self inflicted apocalypse thinking about the consequence 
 Everything we've ever known, all the injustice we've shown 
 Seems to me we have not grown, it's still there in undertones 
 Daily life look around you, this ain't right, made to spite you 
 With they're lies to entice you, hope you bite then endight you 
 It's so sadd, but it's the truth, I wish this play could call a truce 
 Matter of time before we loose and then we all hang from the noose
