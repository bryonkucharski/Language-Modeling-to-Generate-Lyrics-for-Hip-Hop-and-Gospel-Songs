You know it's funny... 
 Every time you get to the last song on your album 
 It kinda makes you wonder like 
 What if this WAS your last song? 
 And if it was, then what would you say? 
 I close my eyes, but it won't go away 
 Am I a passenger aboard this life 
 Or am I just a stowaway? 
 Sometimes I feel my soul's a throw away; 
 Inside is so cold and grey 
 Just hope that I can cope and don't explode today 
 Surrounded by these broken shards from the past 
 I sit and try to analyze these racing thoughts as they pass 
 Friends turn into foes 
 And foes turn into friends 
 It makes you wonder for what purpose we serve 
 All in the end we're falling 
 And thus continues the cycle of our humanity 
 So hard to watch our dreams just dissipate into reality 
 So this goes out to those who feel like me 
 And refuse to walk the beaten path to fight for their own destiny 
 An alien inside my own skin; 
 No matter what I've tried to do in this life, I can't fit in 
 I know there's reasons for things and things for reasons 
 The black sheep: alone in this world since I've been breathing 
 (An alien) 
 Alien inside my own skin 
 No matter what I've tried to do in this life I can't fit in 
 I know there's reasons for things and things for reasons 
 The black sheep: alone in this world since I've been breathing 
 (An alien) 
 Some people say just keep on keeping on 
 Continue putting pens to papers, paying dues and keep on writing songs 
 I find no comfort in these words no more 
 I find no comfort that this world is obsessive with brutal acts of war 
 So keep your friends close man, enemies closer 
 Stay true to your fam and stay standin' banded like soldiers 
 If ignorance is bliss, then silence is golden 
 They use misdirection to keep the public from knowing 
 Beware of Trojan horses, destructive and evil forces 
 Always think before you follow and contemplate who the source is 
 Of who stains to gain 
 Who stands to profit 
 Who shall bare the blame 
 Who'll stand to stop it? 
 The laws of karma coming back again 
 Prozak Hitchcock. Outcast. They call me Alien 
 An alien inside my own skin 
 No matter what I've tried to do in this life I can't fit in 
 I know there's reasons for things and things for reasons 
 The black sheep: alone in this world since I've been breathing 
 (An alien) 
 Alien inside my own skin 
 No matter what I've tried to do in this life, I can't fit in 
 I know there's reasons for things and things for reasons 
 The back sheep: alone in this world since I've been breathing 
 (An alien)
