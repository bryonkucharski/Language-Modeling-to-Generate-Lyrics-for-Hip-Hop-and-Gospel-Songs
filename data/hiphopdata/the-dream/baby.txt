Ll 
 Radio killer 
 Yeah, 
 Y'all think they can handle this one man 
 All right 
 Call the radio and tell 'em this your song 
 (This your song, this your song, this your song, this your song) 
 Girl come on (girl come on, girl come on,) 
 'Cause I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby 
 I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby 
 I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby 
 I'm your baby, your baby 
 Met this little girl, she was off the hook 
 I got cold chills when her body shook 
 Hot sex on the platter no need to cook 
 I let her steal my heart like a horny crook 
 Had her grinding and winding against my leg 
 She messin' with my head, wanna play in the bed 
 Sexy pumps on, toenails red 
 Your body's a gun baby, pump me full of lead 
 It hard to hold you when you movin' vulgar 
 Peace sign on your eyes like John Travolta 
 My pulp ain't fiction, it's an addiction 
 To see your booty clap on the floor in the kitchen 
 Nasty girl, taught me all the lingo 
 While mama play bingo, she ride Mandingo 
 She don't give a damn if I'm married or single 
 She makes me tingle 
 Shawty I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby 
 I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby 
 I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby 
 I'm your baby, your baby 
 She likes Hip-Hop and R&B 
 Her life time goal is to be on TV 
 She looking for a man that could give her a break 
 Like Usher or Justin Timberlake 
 I'm really not sure if her breasts are fake 
 'Cause with whipped cream on em, they taste just like cake 
 We drink some beer, inside of daddy's '64 
 She shot me in the back with cupids arrow 
 We finish the 6-pac, she push the seat back 
 Pulled up her dress 'n' she let me peep that 
 I'm Drunk as a skunk, feeling all dirty 
 Truck stop bathroom at 7:30 
 Bought her some dessert, give a damn if its early 
 Head spinnin' around like roller derby 
 Everything about her says you don't deserve me 
 I hope I'm worthy 
 ('Cause I'm your baby) 
 You need somethin' like me? (Good luck) 
 'Cause he ain't nothin' like me (no) 
 You can search but you never gone find 
 A love that's quite like mine (no) 
 Need a man that can love you good 
 And treat you like he should 
 With me shawty you the shit 
 He might be good but he ain't like this 
 'Cause I'm your baby 
 In the back of the pickup, clothes the rip up 
 She see my chrome wheels, it gets more real 
 Running and laughing, music blasting 
 Side over the road, bent over crashing 
 Mouth all dry, can feel the urge 
 If you see my mama, don't say a word 
 The cops wanna know I'm a word are slurred 
 Don't ask me officer ask her 
 Wanna another drink baby she like sure 
 Wanna hit the club she like I don't care 
 She all in the rear-view doin' her here 
 Hairspray and lip gloss everywhere 
 This all happens on an average day 
 Your life is a trip girl, I'm here to stay 
 Never had a girl make me feel this way 
 Even tho I had to pay
