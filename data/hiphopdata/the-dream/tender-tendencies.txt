You wanna tell 'em how bad I hurt you, yeah I know 
 You wanna tell them how I mistreated your love, 
 Well here we go 
 I'll tell them about all the lies 
 I'll tell them how harsh I am, and that's why you cry 
 I said I would never leave no matter what, 
 And here I am leaving no matter what 
 You know I have tender tendencies 
 You know about all this shit daily 
 You know after my charm, my tendencies go off like alarms 
 And baby I know, baby I know, I know, I know, I know, baby I know 
 Listen baby I know, baby I know, I know, I know, baby I know 
 So I'll sing this song for you 
 La-da-da-da-da 
 I'll sing this song for you 
 La-da-da-da-da 
 I'm asking what to do since I made your heart all blue 
 She said sing this song for me about you 
 I'll tell them how impatient I am 
 I'll tell them how self-centered I am 
 I won't hide a thing 
 I'll tell them bout these secrets I've had 
 I'll tell them about my insecurities 
 You know, I have tender tendencies 
 You know I battle this shit daily 
 You know after my bullshit and charm these tendencies go off like alarms 
 And baby I know, baby I know, I know, I know, I know, baby I know 
 Baby I know, baby I know, I know, I know, I know, baby I know 
 Baby I go off like alarms 
 My tendencies go off like alarms, baby 
 So allow me to sing this song for you' 
 La-da-da-da-da 
 I'll sing your song for you 
 Baby La-da-da-da-da 
 So I'm asking what to do since I made your heart all blue 
 She said sing this song for me about you 
 Baby I know 
 (You know I can't stand it) 
 I know, I know, I know 
 (Don't you dare leave me here) 
 Please baby pick up the ṗhone 
 You just left and you already miss 
 Here all alone in this room and there's no sign of you 
 Just me and your perfume, lingering in my doom
