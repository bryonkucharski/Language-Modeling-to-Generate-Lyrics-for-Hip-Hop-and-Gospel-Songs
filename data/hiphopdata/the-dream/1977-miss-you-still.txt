No matter how many things I have 
 No one will ever love me your way 
 No matter what love invades my space 
 One thing's for sure, you won't be replaced 
 If you can't see the tears running down my eyes 
 I guess I've got to make this song cry 
 If you can't see the tears running down my eyes 
 I guess I've got to make this song cry 
 It hurts me just to see your name 
 And that tattoo runs right through my veins 
 My sister misses you the same 
 And it hurts me 'cause I know she just can't say 
 And what I would give to see your face 
 Wherever you are, I pray you're safe 
 Forgive me for my selfish ways 
 For I know that you're better off these days 
 Baby I miss you every time it rains 
 And no matter how bright the sun may shine, 
 It never dries away the pain 
 Singing ooh oh ooh oh 
 Singing ooh oh ooh oh 
 And you're written all over me 
 So much so I can't believe 
 Your grandchildren are a sight to see 
 Everyday they're more of you and less of me 
 And what a cliche, I know you're here, 
 No fair, I know you're near 
 No matter how many things I have 
 No one will ever love me your way 
 No matter what love invades my space 
 One thing's for sure, you won't be replaced 
 Baby I miss you every time it rains 
 And no matter how bright the sun may shine, 
 It will never dry away this pain 
 And I'm singing ooh oh ooh oh 
 And I'm singing ooh oh ooh oh 
 If you can't see the 
 Tears running down my eyes 
 I guess I've got to make this song cry 
 If you can't see the tears running down my eyes 
 I guess I've got to make this song cry 
 Mama I miss you, every time it rains 
 No matter how bright the sun may shine, 
 It will never dry away this pain 
 And I'm singing ooh oh 
 And I'm singing ooh oh 
 And I'm singing ooh oh 
 And I'm singing ooh oh
