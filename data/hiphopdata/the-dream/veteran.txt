Whoa! 
 Oh my God! 
 Whoa! 
 Radio Killa! 
 I heard you ain't hittin' it right 
 He ain't got the right love for you 
 He got the job but he can't work it like I do 
 He's young-minded, sometimin' 
 And you need a man that can handle you 
 It's hard to find them rare diamonds 
 But you love it when you do 
 I know you're used to those fly-by-night boyfriends 
 But what you really need is me, woman 
 Always up in the VIP 
 Always yelling out, "Drinks on me!" 
 Always all tricked up 
 Always never not givin' a fuck 
 Got my playas over here 
 And my haters over there 
 I got my drink up in the air 
 'Cause she on her way over 
 'Cause I'm a veteran 
 She dancing up on me, dancing up on me, hold me all close 
 Diamonds on my wrist, got her eyes wide open 
 And the Belvedere got her coming out her clothes 
 I'm a veteran 
 First I buy out the bar, then I pop bottles 
 I own what I'm sippin' 
 They don't make a car I can't dip in 
 You trippin' 
 But she 
 You ain't hittin' it right 
 You ain't hittin' it right 
 You ain't hittin' it right 
 You ain't hittin' it right 
 You ain't gettin' it right 
 You ain't gettin' it right 
 You ain't gettin' it right 
 She needs some Dream in her life, yeah 
 Girl, I know you ain't getting the love that you deserve 
 No no, no no, no no, no no, no no, no no, no no, no! 
 And girl I know I can please you, all you got to do is say the word 
 Girl you know, girl you know, girl you know, girl you know, oh! 
 The man you with ain't cool 
 He's full of insecurities 
 I can keep a relationship smooth 
 You should fuck with me 
 Always up in the VIP 
 Always yelling out, "Drinks on me!" 
 Always all tricked up 
 Always never not givin' a fuck 
 Got my playas over here 
 And my haters over there 
 I got my drink up in the air 
 'Cause she on her way over 
 'Cause I'm a veteran 
 She dancing up on me, dancing up on me, hold me all close 
 Diamonds on my wrist, got her eyes wide open 
 And the Belvedere got her coming out her clothes 
 I'm a veteran 
 First I buy out the bar, then I pop bottles 
 I own what I'm sippin' 
 They don't make a car I can't dip in 
 You trippin' 
 But she 
 You ain't hittin' it right 
 You ain't hittin' it right 
 You ain't hittin' it right 
 You ain't gettin' it right 
 You ain't hittin' it right 
 You ain't gettin' it right
