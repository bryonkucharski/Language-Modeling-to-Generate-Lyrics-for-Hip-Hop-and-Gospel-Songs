'Cause it's you, 'cause of you 
 Even though I said we're through 
 It's all because of you, Nikki 
 She told me she would always be there 
 And I believed her, believed her 
 This girl was no good for me 
 She had so many secrets, secrets, yeah 
 Even though she wasn't my main girl 
 I'm still committed, it was me and you 
 You said you wouldn't tell 
 But you saved my voicemails 
 But I always knew 
 So now cry till you drown your face 
 And bitch, I give a damn how harsh this may seem 
 I'm here to put your heart in its place 
 Chained up in the bottom of the lake 
 Now let the waterfall 
 (Abyss, abyss) 
 Now let the waterfall 
 (Abyss, abyss) 
 Now let the waterfall 
 (Abyss, abyss) 
 Now let the waterfall 
 (Abyss, abyss) 
 Now let the waterfall 
 (Abyss, abyss) 
 Now let the waterfall 
 (Abyss, abyss) 
 Now let the waterfall 
 (Abyss, abyss) 
 Now let the waterfall 
 (Abyss, abyss) 
 I was the innocent bystander 
 She had etiquette, she had good manners 
 Pretty little thing, great little body 
 Never in magazines, never at after parties 
 And I could sense it then, but it didn't matter 
 As long as me and you were together 
 Thought it was better than that 
 I'll never let you back to me 
 Tell your boy at Us Weekly 
 I sent your photos to TMZ 
 Now cry till you drown your face 
 And bitch, I could give a damn how harsh this may seem 
 But I'm here to put your heart in its place 
 Chained up at the bottom of the lake 
 Now let the waterfall 
 (Abyss, abyss) 
 Now let the waterfall 
 (Abyss, abyss) 
 Now let the waterfall 
 (Abyss, abyss) 
 Now let the waterfall 
 (Abyss, abyss) 
 Now let the waterfall 
 (Abyss, abyss) 
 Now let the waterfall 
 (Abyss, abyss) 
 Now let the waterfall 
 (Abyss, abyss) 
 Now let the waterfall 
 (Abyss, abyss) 
 Now let the waterfall 
 If only the sun would come 
 And dry the water away 
 But you're in the abyss, my lady 
 And you won't see another day 
 Now cry till you drown your face 
 And bitch, I could give a damn how harsh this may seem 
 But I'm here to put your heart in its place 
 Chained up at the bottom of the lake 
 Now let the water fall 
 (If only the sun would come and) 
 Water fall 
 (Dry the water away) 
 Now let the water fall 
 (But you're in the abyss, my lady) 
 Now let the water fall 
 (And you won't see another day) 
 Now let the water fall 
 (If only the sun would come and) 
 Now let the water fall 
 (Dry the water away) 
 Now let the water fall 
 (But you're in the abyss, my lady) 
 Now let the water fall 
 (And you won't see another day) 
 Now let the water fall 
 (If only the sun would come and) 
 Now let the water fall 
 (Dry the water away) 
 Now let the water fall 
 (But you're in the abyss, my lady) 
 The water fall 
 (And you won't see another day) 
 If only the sun would come 
 And dry the water away 
 But you're in the abyss, my lady 
 And you won't see another day
