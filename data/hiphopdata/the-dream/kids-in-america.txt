Looking out a dirty old window 
 Down below the cars in the 
 City go rushing by 
 I sit here alone 
 And I wonder why 
 Friday night and everyone's moving 
 I can feel the heat 
 But it's shooting 
 Heading down 
 I search for the beat in this dirty town 
 Down town the young ones are going 
 Down town the young ones are growing 
 We're the kids in America 
 We're the kids in America 
 Everybody live for the music-go-round 
 Bright lights the music gets faster 
 Look boy, don't check on your watch 
 Not another glance 
 I'm not leaving now, honey not a chance 
 Hot-shot, give me no problems 
 Much later baby you'll be saying never mind 
 You know life is cruel, life is never kind 
 Kind hearts don't make a new story 
 Kind hearts don't grab any glory 
 We're the kids in America 
 We're the kids in America 
 Everybody live for the music-go-round 
 Come closer, honey that's better 
 Got to get a brand new experience 
 Feeling right 
 Oh don't try to stop baby 
 New York to California 
 There's a new wave coming we warn ya 
 We're the kids in America 
 We're the kids in America 
 Everybody live for the music-go-round 
 We're the kids 
 We're the kids 
 We're the kids in America
