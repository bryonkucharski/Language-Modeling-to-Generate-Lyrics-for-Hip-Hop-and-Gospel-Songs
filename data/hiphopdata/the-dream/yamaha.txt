You know what you remind me of? 
 Didn't catch your name, lil' mama 
 Well I don't know your name, lil' mama 
 Well, I don't know 
 I don't know your name, lil' mama 
 Said, I don't know your name, lil' mama 
 Baby, you wouldn't last a day 
 In your world 
 Baby, I wanna be your man 
 You should be my girl 
 Baby, ooh, I wanna be your 
 All you ever talk about 
 Baby, uh and if you let me in that body 
 I'ma turn that motherfucker out 
 Baby, don't make me watch 
 If I can't ride it 
 And I didn't catch your name, lil' mama 
 But I decided 
 Every time I mention you 
 I'll say Yamaha, Yamaha, oh Yamaha 
 That's my little Yamaha, Yamaha, oh Yamaha 
 Oh baby, throw me the key 
 I'll be the perfect passenger 
 Don't throw him the key, no 
 'Cause all he'll do is gas you up 
 Let me freak you on the freeway 
 And every hour I'll beat into your heart, I'ma push to the max 
 Police hate us, why? 
 'Cause they never seen a girl with an ass so phat 
 Baby, don't make me watch 
 If I can't ride it 
 And I didn't catch your name, lil' mama 
 But I decided 
 Every time I mention you 
 I'll say Yamaha, Yamaha, oh Yamaha 
 That reminds me of my Yamaha 
 Yamaha, oh Yamaha 
 Every time I mention you 
 I'll say Yamaha, Yamaha, oh Yamaha 
 There's nothing quite like you, my baby 
 Yamaha, Yamaha, oh my Yamaha 
 Oh baby, oh baby 
 Oh baby, oh baby 
 Ass so phat, hey 
 Oh baby, oh baby 
 Never seen a girl with an ass so phat 
 Seen a lotta places, been all around the world 
 A lotta pretty faces, a lotta pretty girls 
 This one is for you, wherever you're at 
 Still got ya name tattooed on my back 
 Still got ya name tattooed on my back 
 Still got ya name tattooed on my back 
 Get the clutch and the brake, get this motherfucker running 
 Me and you, together, girl, they never seen it coming 
 Clutch, brake, get this motherfucker running 
 Me, together they ain't never seen it coming 
 Seen a lotta places, been all around the world 
 A lotta pretty faces, a lotta pretty girls 
 This one is for you, wherever you're at 
 Still got ya name tattooed on my back 
 Still got ya name tattooed on my back 
 Still got ya name tattooed on my back 
 Get the clutch, the brake, get this motherfucker running 
 Me and you, together, girl, they never seen it coming 
 Clutch, brake, get this motherfucker running 
 Me and you, together, girl, they never seen it coming 
 Clutch, brake, get this motherfucker running
