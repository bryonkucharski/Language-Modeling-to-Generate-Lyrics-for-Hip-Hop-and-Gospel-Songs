Started out talking right here 
 Putting it down like a muthafuckin mack 
 Selling candy all up in my ear 
 She wanna be down like the D's on the lac 
 Slow dancing in the club 
 Diamonds look like rainbows 
 She grindin on my dick 
 She looking for the pot of gold 
 We hop up in the AMG indeed we in the western 
 She putting moves on me, I coulda swore shawty's a wrestler 
 Talking all that shit soon as I hit 
 Now I got her talkin' like this 
 In a falsetto

 Every time she leave the crib shawty be coming right back 
 She talking dirty all up in my ear 
 And I'm finna put this dog right on her kitty cat 
 I wasn't gon show you up 
 But then you got that liquor in you 
 Calling last night fluke 
 Acting like she didn't remember 
 I hopped up out the linen and I'm finna defend my title 
 Finna put your ass to bed 
 Tell me which way would you like it 
 Talkin' all that shit soon as I hit 
 Now I got her talkin' like this (whoa oh oh oh oh)
