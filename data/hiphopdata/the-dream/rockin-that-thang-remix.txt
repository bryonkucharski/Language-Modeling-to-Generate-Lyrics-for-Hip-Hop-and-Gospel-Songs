 The-Dream: 
 Girl I'm in love with you baby.

 And I'm trying to be yours.

 But I told her that her body looks better with mine. [x2] 
 Fabolous: 
 I like the way she rock, her hips 
 Them rockin' hips 
 Told her we can take off like rocket ships 
 Straight jacket jeans, you look crazy in em' 
 The way you rockin' that, I thought they were jay z denim 
 Let me drop a jewel on ya, put a roc in air 
 Can I call you nana cause you got that rockin' chair 
 It go back and forth- then forth and back 
 When I'm on patron or off the yak 
 Cnt get off the fact I'm off my mac 
 Goldie prolly wouldn't, but I would trick off of that 
 And I'm sick with the money, I can cough a stack 
 I can sneeze some g's so baby let's roll

 Juelz Santana: 
 Whoa, whoa 
 Look how shorty roll, roll 
 She rockin' that shit 
 I'm like look at shorty go, go 
 She rockin' to the beat, she rockin' it for me 
 And all I can think about is rockin' it to sleep 
 Her face is like a model 
 Body shape just like a bottle 
 Girl I wanna hit that more than I wanna hit the lotto 
 She revvin' me up, I got my hand on my throttle 
 I wanna get on top of her, zoom on the yamaha 
 So you can call it switchin' gears 
 Zoom inside of her 
 And if it taste how it look I'm a try to swallow her 
 Call me Mr. Shoe- shine, baby I'm a polish ya 
 And I leave ya spit clean, I dnt use no polisher 
 Demolition man, tell your friends I demolish ya 
 Plus I'm that nigga, baby I could make you popular 
 So get another shot of ciroc in ya 
 'Cause I'm gon' be rockin' ya 
 Treat you like my first ladt

 Rick Ross: 
 Fresh as a black president one 
 Air force ones in my air force one (obama) 
 Is it all a dream? (no) sorry my reality 
 See me rockin' that shit is complementing my salary 
 Complementary balance, told em' what we tally 
 Spinning like it's ballet & I touched the budget ballot (boss) 
 See the girl, & holla (ey)

 Ludacris: 
 Now let me take you to a place far beyond 
 In a whole nother galaxy 
 Travel in your mind, explore your sexuality 
 Melt your imagination, & mold it into reality 
 Your hearts me art gallery girl 
 Can you feel the pictures that I painted 
 Cause all of them are related like a mother & a son 
 But none of them overrated 
 There no others, you the one 
 Our destiny is to make it 
 Gotta thank you just for sharing your world 
 It's so real, an inspiration for no reason 
 But thinking that I'm incapable of taking on the duty of making you interchangeable 
 The thought is sensational, it's perfect bliss 
 I'm ready to take the milky way to your hershey's kiss 
 You know my tongue's got batteries in it 
 The bedroom, we lose calories in it and start families in it 
 And dnt worry cause the situations under control 
 So let me dive in your heart and swim around in your soul (luda) 
 The-Dream: 
 Take me, I'm yours, shorty 
 As we rock to the left, rock to the right 
 Lend me your body and we'll rock it all night 
 Tell the niggas hollaback, tell your girls goodnite 
 The way you rockin' that up in this club 
 I swear you gonna make a nigga fall in love [x2]
