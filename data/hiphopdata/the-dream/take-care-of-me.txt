I'm not the same as them, I'm not the one 
 So you better take care of me 
 If I fight for you, you better fight for me 
 Take care of me 
 I'll build you up, to the sky 
 Girl, I'll take care of you 
 I'll never wrong you, I'll never lie 
 I'll take care of you 
 But don't take my love for granted 
 Girl, don't take my love for granted 
 Act like you'll always need me 
 Act like you only see me 
 Don't take my heart for granted 
 And don't take my heart and strand it 
 Don't turn my love to hate 
 Put back in it what you take 
 Or I will break you down, you down 
 I will break you down, I'll break you down 
 Girl, I will break you down, I'll break you down 
 Girl, I'll break you down, I'll break you down, girl 
 I wear my heart on my shirt 
 So beware of me 
 Every thought, will be a thought of you 
 Girl, beware of me 
 Mini hell shattered my spirits 
 So I'll be aware of you 
 And if you fool me once, you'll never fool me again 
 I'll be aware of you 
 So don't take, don't, don't so don't don't 
 So so don't take my love for granted 
 Girl, don't take my love for granted 
 Say that you only see me 
 Say that you'll always need me 
 Don't take my heart for granted 
 Don't take my heart and strand it 
 I can turn this love to hate 
 Anytime I want to any day 
 I will break us down, us down 
 I will break us down, I'll break us down 
 Girl, I will break us down, I'll break us down 
 Girl I'll break us down, I'll break us down girl 
 I wear my heart on my shirt 
 So beware of me 
 Every thought will be a thought of you 
 Girl, beware of me 
 I will break us down, us down 
 I will break us down, I'll break us down 
 Girl, I will break us down, I'll break us down 
 Girl, I'll break us down, I'll break us down girl 
 Not giving love without it being returned 
 You can't profit from a love that's never been earned 
 Nothing is forever except forever 
 Love shouldn't just be an endeavor, endeavor, endeavor
