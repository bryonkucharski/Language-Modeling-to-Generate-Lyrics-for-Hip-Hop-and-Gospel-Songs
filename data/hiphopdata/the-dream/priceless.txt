Leave the world behind

 Radio killa! 
 She never goes on? 
 She always got them nails done 
 The kind of girl every man is looking for 
 Her g-string always match her bra 
 And she's always worth my mention 
 Even if other niggas don't pay attention to her 
 Her smile can unite the world 
 I'm just mad that she ain't my girl 
 I'll give back every song I wrote 
 I'll give back every song I sang 
 If I could just roll up on you 
 Slap my barcode on you and check you out in my lane 
 Shawty priceless 
 Yep, she priceless 
 All the money in the world 
 Couldn't purchase this girl 
 Don't even ask what the price is 
 Priceless, priceless, priceless, priceless 
 Priceless, priceless, priceless, priceless 
 No 
 No she ain't an R&B singer 
 No, she don't need 10 karats on her finger 
 No, regular working girl 
 East coast but she act like a Southern girl 
 Bobby Brown, Petal lip gloss 
 Runnin' 'round on her lips 'til I get lost 
 Real niggas go an' kiss whatever 
 'Cause I can kiss this bitch forever 
 I'll give back every song I wrote 
 I'll give back every song I sang 
 If I could just roll up on you 
 Slap my barcode on you and check you out in my lane 
 Shawty priceless 
 Yep, she priceless 
 All the money in the world 
 Couldn't purchase this girl 
 Don't even ask what the price is 
 Priceless, priceless, priceless, priceless 
 Priceless, priceless, priceless, priceless 
 I'll never have the right amount of currency 
 Even if I hit the lottery in 50 states, baby 
 And you are the meaning of love 
 Beyond any diamond I could ever dream of, no pun intended 
 Girl, my story needs you as the happy ending 
 And asking you to marry me ain't even enough 
 I'll need you through nine more lives 
 Seeing your love eighteen times through my eyes 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Shawty priceless 
 Yep, she priceless 
 All the money in the world 
 Couldn't purchase this girl 
 Don't even ask what the price is 
 Priceless, priceless, priceless, priceless 
 Priceless, priceless, priceless, priceless 
 Put your black card up 
 Shawty, she priceless 
 Put your Phantom up! 
 She priceless, yeah 
 The crib in L.A., or whatever you say 
 There's not an amount, there's not enough money to count 
 She's priceless, oh she's priceless 
 She priceless, she's priceless 
 She's priceless, shawty priceless 
 L.O.S.!
