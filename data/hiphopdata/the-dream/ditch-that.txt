After we leave Be all you need 
 All those victoria sectrets let me see 
 Watch your feet never mind baby you owe me 
 For them drinks at the bar and for smoking this weed 
 He ain't like me 
 I can make your days and nights look like fantasies 
 He ain't got nothing on me 
 My garage looks like the **??** regisrty 
 I'm so suburb Shorty what's the word 
 If you looking for love (love, love) I'll give you what you deserve 
 Stay your ass to the crib and - Ditch that ****** 
 You try to fuck are you still playing - Ditch that ****** 
 You need a grown ass man girl - Ditch that ****** 
 You understand what I'm saying girl - Ditch that ****** 
 (I'm got them out on the floor like - Ditch that ****** 4x) 
 (I got them up in the club - Ditch that ****** 4x)
