This is an interpretation of what a mother tells her son 
 Her only one 
 Sometimes, this road will bear no signs of direction, direction 
 So rely on your heart to lead the way, lead the way, lead 
 And sometimes you will need to take correction, correction 
 Don't you dare let your humble mind sway proceed 
 See, some days will be brighter than a baby's name 
 And others will be grayer than the hairs on your daddy's face 
 And when those gray days start to come 
 Just take it in and just say 
 Ooh ooh ooh, and know that the sun's coming tomorrow, oh yeah, I promise 
 Ooh ooh ooh, you know that it will be okay, yeah 
 Ooh ooh ooh, and know that the sun's coming tomorrow, oh yeah, I promise 
 Ooh ooh ooh, you know that it will be okay, yeah 
 Off Don't wonder, off, don't wonder, off 
 Don't wonder, off, don't wonder, off 
 I'll let you know, I wanna let you know, mother, oh 
 I wanna let you know how I've been thinkin' 'bout you 
 How I've been thinkin' of you 
 Always thinkin' of you 
 I wanna let you know I've been thinkin' of you 
 Always thinkin' of you 
 I'm always thinkin' of you 
 It was you that brought me through 
 You were everything I ever knew 
 If I could bring you back 
 I'd do it in a split second, no if, ands or buts at all 
 How I've been thinkin' 'bout you 
 How I've been thinkin' of you 
 If I can bring you back 
 How I've been thinkin' 'bout you 
 How I've been thinkin' of you 
 Ooh ooh ooh, oh yeah 
 Ooh ooh ooh, oh yeah
