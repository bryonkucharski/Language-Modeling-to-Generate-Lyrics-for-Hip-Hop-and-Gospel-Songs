The Dream] 
 Radio Killa 
 Did a song with the American Dream 
 They can't put it down like this, no no no no 
 On my baby, she my shorty 
 Oh, we rockin' 
 They gotta trip all up on their breath 
 They hate on us 
 Now who's right there every time you cry? 
 Gonna sleep and wake up on your side? 
 Endless love I'll always provide 
 They hatin' on us and you should know why 
 But who's be lovin' you lately? 
 Who's willing to go half on the baby? 
 Who ooh ooh's trying to flag our ship? 
 They just tryin' to get the love you give 
 But baby, 
 Tell me what they know about my love (my love) [x8] 
 (Mariah Carey) 
 So they don't understand why I'll never leave you 
 Explain my love? I don't need to 
 Got everybody way up in our business 
 'Cause lovin' each other stay on their wish list 
 I see them reachin' every time you call me baby 
 They on my back like a shirt, get off me baby 
 They don't love me, let them wonder why 
 Here to stay and they going bye bye 
 Who's the one calling you baby 
 Who's in love with your ass like crazy? 
 Who who who's gonna flag our ship? 
 They just tryna get the love you give baby 
 Tell me what they know about my love (my love)[x8] 
 My love is your love 
 There ain't nothing in this world that they can do to make me give you up 
 Oh baby you will always be my girl 
 So let them do whatever, say whatever 
 'Cause I ain't givin' her up 
 Tell me what they know about my love (my love) [x8]
