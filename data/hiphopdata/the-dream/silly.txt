Silly of me to think that I could ever have you for my guy 
 How I love you... how I want you... 
 Silly of me to think that you could ever really want me too 
 How I love you... 
 You're just a lover out to score 
 I know that I should be looking for more 
 What could it be in you I see 
 What could it be... 
 Oh, love, oh, love, stop making a fool of me 
 Oh, love, oh, love, stop making a fool of me 
 Silly of me to think that you could ever know the things I do 
 Are all done for you... only for you 
 Silly of me to take the time to comb my hair and pour the wine 
 And know you're not there 
 You're just a lover out to score 
 I know that I should be looking for more 
 What could it be in you I see 
 What could it be... 
 Oh, love, oh, love, stop making a fool of me 
 Oh, love, oh, love, stop making a fool of me 
 Ooh 
 Silly of me to go around and brag about the love I found 
 And say you're the best, well, I can't tell the rest 
 Foolish of me to tell them all that every night and day you call 
 When you could care less 
 You're just a lover out to score 
 I know that I should be looking for more 
 What could it be in you I see 
 What could it be... 
 Oh, love, oh, love, stop making a fool of me 
 Oh, love, oh, love, stop making a fool of me
