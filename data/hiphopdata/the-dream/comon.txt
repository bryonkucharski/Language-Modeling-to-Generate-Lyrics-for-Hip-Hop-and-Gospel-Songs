Me and you used to be close 
 You used hang out round my way 
 And now a nigga feel like shit 
 Every time the DJ start doing his thing 
 His thing thing thing 
 His thing 
 Doing his thing 
 DJ... 
 Does anybody love anymore? 
 The sad lyrics are driving me crazy 
 I'm sittin' up in here all alone 
 You see, yesterday I lost my baby 
 Top phones on my radio 
 This record seems to be their favorite 
 Top painted 80's on 
 Another fuckin' break up song 
 I'll be sippin on this deuce till the break of dawn 
 Screamin DJ, don't you play that song 
 I know you just tryna get yo playlist on 
 And have me rollin' in my tears till the break of dawn 
 I be sippin on this bottle baby all night long 
 Dreamin' DJ, don't you play that song 
 I know you just tryna get yo playlist on 
 Deuce got me rollin' in my tears all night long 
 Com'on, Com'on, Com'on, Com'on 
 Com'on, Com'on, Com'on 
 Com'on, Com'on, Com'on, Com'on 
 I know it's comin' 
 Oh, I can fill these empty bottles with my tears 
 Lookin' in this mirror with a broken heart 
 That's bad luck for 7 years 
 And after begging for your love 
 You rip right through my heart, through my heart 
 After begging for your love 
 Baby, don't know who you are 
 Yeah yeah 
 I'll be sippin on this deuce till the break of dawn 
 Screamin DJ, don't you play that song 
 I know you just tryna get yo playlist on 
 And have me rollin' in my tears till the break of dawn 
 I be sippin on this bottle baby all night long 
 Dreamin' DJ, don't you play that song 
 I know you just tryna get yo playlist on 
 Deuce got me rollin' in my tears all night long 
 Com'on, Com'on, Com'on, Com'on 
 Com'on, Com'on, Com'on 
 Com'on, Com'on, Com'on, Com'on 
 I know it's comin' 
 Me and you used to be close 
 You used hang out round my way 
 And now a nigga feel like shit 
 Every time the DJ start doing his thing 
 And I'm sick on my stomach 
 'Cause I know it's comin' 
 Killin' me softly with that song song song 
 Go on and get it over, so I can get over it 
 Finally think you're over it but then here it goes again 
 I'll be sippin on this deuce till the break of dawn (all night long) 
 Screamin DJ, don't you play that song (don't you play that song) 
 I know you just tryna get yo playlist on 
 And have me rollin' in my tears till the break of dawn 
 I be sippin on this bottle baby all night long (sippin on this bottle) 
 Dreamin' DJ, don't you play that song 
 I know you just tryna get yo playlist on 
 Deuce got me rollin' in my tears all night long 
 Com'on, Com'on, Com'on, Com'on 
 Com'on, Com'on, Com'on 
 Com'on, Com'on, Com'on, Com'on 
 I know it's comin' 
 DJ start callin out the countdown 
 Number 8, take it easy on my heart now 
 You know number 7 ain't number 6 
 Come on partner get it over with 
 It ain't number 5, it ain't number 4 
 Got my heart out here in the cold 
 If it ain't number 3 must be number 2 
 'Cause if it's number 1, I'm done
