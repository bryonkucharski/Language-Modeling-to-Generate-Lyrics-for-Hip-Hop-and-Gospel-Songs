Face down, ass up 
 That's the way we like to 
 Do you in my Benz truck 
 Then he call your friends up 
 Yeah, I put it on her 
 She won't even bring her man's up 
 Damn bruh 
 Heard that you need to get them ends up 
 On her like a poster pimpin' 
 Yeah, I got her pinned up 
 Hemmed up 
 Top to the bottom, get your hands up 
 Police at my door, knockin' 
 Beggin' me for more, drop it 
 Excuse me, Mr. Officer 
 But what more can your offer her? 
 Nigga, I ain't trippin' 
 She can go where ever she like 
 You'll never catch me slippin' 
 Nigga, my love game is so tight 
 And I'll give her whatever she needs 
 And you can't match a love like mine 
 It's like tryin' to rob me with a BB gun 
 But my love gets it poppin' like the Taliban 
 And you know that I got that fire 
 That blazin', amazin' hood shit 
 That bangin' out them head boards, hood shit 
 And you know this 
 So baby, girl 
 She ain't goin' nowhere, partna 
 She stayin' right here 
 Baby, girl 
 I don't know why you lookin' 
 Can't you see ain't nothin' cookin'? 
 Baby, girl 
 Got her wrapped around my finger 
 Sowed up like a singer 
 Baby, girl 
 I make every nigga irrelevant 
 I'm sex intelligent 
 Sex intelligent 
 Know how to work it right 
 I'm sex intelligent 
 I know how to work it right 
 I'm sex intelligent 
 I know how to work it right 
 I make every nigga irrelevant

 What could you be thinkin'? 
 Don't you know that she's mine? 
 Better re-think it 
 I know, I know, I know shawty fine 
 But she took like a motherfuckin' crook, yeah 
 Like a ticket I got her booked, yeah 
 Kinda like a fiend I got shawty hooked, yeah 
 Earthquake, shawty shook it, yeah 
 She might even chill at the bar with you for a minute 
 While she's there with you, she's thinkin' how I hit it 
 Shawty can't forget it 
 I bust it down, break it down, blunt raw split it 
 So baby, girl 
 She ain't goin' nowhere, partna 
 She stayin' right here 
 Baby, girl 
 I don't know why you lookin' 
 Can't you see ain't nothin' cookin'? 
 Baby, girl

 Sowed up like a singer

 Get up in my world 
 Let me put it on you, girl 
 Love you, baby 
 Until I drive you crazy 
 Know this song is over 
 But I can't get up off ya 
 Come on baby, closer 
 Get up on this coaster 
 And ride it out, ride it out 
 Until my theme park closes 
 Grind it out, grind it out 
 Until the park reopens 
 You're the breakfast in my bed 
 Just give me a little bit 
 Whatever you had to do is irrelevant 
 I'm sex intelligent 
 Yeah, yeah 
 I'm sex intelligent 
 Yeah
