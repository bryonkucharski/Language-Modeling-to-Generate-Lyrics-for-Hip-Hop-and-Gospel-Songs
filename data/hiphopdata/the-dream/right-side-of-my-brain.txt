 U touch me baby 
 Then you untouch me baby 
 U feed me your lies 
 Words like pie 
 U warned me baby 
 Then you unwarn me baby 
 Outsmart me baby 
 And I'm back, I'm crazy 
 But I should be ashamed 
 'Cause I let 
 U do me this way 
 And then it's un-

 -2nd verse- 
 U love me baby 
 Unlove me baby.

 U lock the doors on our home.

 Then your hardly baby.

 Then you see me go. 
 U say I'm your friend 
 And U'll be there in the end.

 Can't lie, it's un- 
 Fortunate to say that love 
 Never lets me use...
