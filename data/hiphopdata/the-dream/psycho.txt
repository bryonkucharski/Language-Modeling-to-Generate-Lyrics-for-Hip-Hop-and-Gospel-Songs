Well I'd hurt for you 
 Roaming in these perfect walls of love 
 Baby, we'll stretch your time 
 And I cling to you 
 Like a child in a smoke filled room 
 Hold on to you 
 And I swear you don't the feeling 
 And I can kill it 
 I swear, girl you don't the feeling 
 I wish you could feel it 
 The sunlight's everywhere but where I want it to be 
 The darkness everywhere I see 
 You're making me psycho, psycho, psycho 
 Can't let go, let go, let go 
 Everything I do, brings me back to you you you you 
 And every decision that you do do do 
 You're making me psycho, psycho, psycho 
 Me and my painted walls 
 I should be in your car for you 
 But my echoes that I'm facing 
 And everything I've been taking 
 And I turn to you 
 And I don't know what's holding us back 
 In silence, by this painted glass 
 Girl, you don't this feeling 
 I paint this picture 
 I swear, girl you don't this feeling 
 I'm iller 
 The stars shine everywhere but where I want it to be 
 And space is everywhere between you and me 
 You're making me psycho, psycho, psycho 
 Can't let go, let go, let go 
 Everything I do, brings me back to you you you you 
 And every decision that you do do do 
 You're making me psycho, psycho, psycho 
 Me and my painted walls 
 Painted walls, inside of walls 
 To me you could fuck everybody who wants, that it wants 
 Even when you're near me, you can't heal me 
 Soundproof fixtures, quilted ceilings 
 Talking to myself in a room with no one else 
 And I tell you that I care but no one's there 
 You're making me psycho, psycho, psycho
