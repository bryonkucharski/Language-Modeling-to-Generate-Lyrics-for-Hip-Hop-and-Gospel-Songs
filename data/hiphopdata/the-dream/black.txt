I feel real black right now 
 Real black right now 
 I feel real black right now 
 Real black right now 
 I feel real black right now 
 Real black right now 
 I never knew you like I should've known you 
 But my father spoke of you trough that liquor 
 Can we get a curtain call 
 Let us pray your idea outlives you 
 'Cause everywhere there is a Chicago 
 The only way we're getting out of here is if hit the Lotto 
 My Mama left the incense burning on the dresser 
 A hard way to learn one lesson 
 She said never be impressed with 
 A man with no message 
 I feel real black right now 
 Real black right now 
 I'm feeling real black right now 
 Real black right now 
 And I'll never be Mr. Madiba 
 I'm gonna thank you the next time I see you 
 You got me feeling real black right now 
 Real black right now 
 The oppression of a young Malcolm 
 The shots rang out across the balcony 
 The day we lost a dream 
 Too young to sing Marvin Gaye's "What's going on" 
 Since then ain't been a lot going on 
 Enough pain can a make a whole race bitter 
 They say the right amount of love can heal us 
 Reminiscing back when Hilfiger made us feel like niggas 
 And that's the kind of thing that sticks with you 
 I never felt this black 
 I'm feeling real black right now 
 Real black right now 
 I'm feeling real black right now 
 Real black right now 
 And I'll never be Mr. Mediba 
 I'm gonna thank you the next time I see you 
 You got me feeling real black right now 
 Real black right now 
 Somebody take us home 
 Take me home (Whoa) 
 Baby let's go home (Whoa) 
 Let's go home (Whoa) 
 You got me feeling real black right now 
 Real black right now 
 You got me feeling real black right now 
 Real black right now 
 You got me feeling real black right now 
 Real black right now 
 You got me feeling real black right now 
 Real black right now 
 Somebody take us home 
 You got me feeling real black right now 
 Real black right now 
 Y'all got me feeling real black right now 
 Real black right now
