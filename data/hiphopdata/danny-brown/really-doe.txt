You niggas don't even know 
 All that talk then no show 
 Cannot tell me nothin' 
 Show me somethin' I ain't seen before 
 That hoe want my piccolo 
 Smoking on that mistletoe 
 Make her kiss all on it 
 While we chop chop on them 24s 
 She look like a centerfold 
 Mouth all on my genitals 
 Suckin' on it like she gettin' vitamins and minerals 
 I be on the chemicals, she be on my testicles 
 Poke her with my tentacle then put her out my schedules 
 Rolling up them vegetables 
 Rapping with that special flow 
 Only way you're next to blow if you be strapped with C4 
 I be fresh from head to toe, every day a fashion show 
 Used to tote that Calico and serve like John McEnroe 
 Now I sell out all my shows 
 Used to sell out all my blow 
 That was back when we was coppin' dubs to try and roll up 4 
 Now a nigga livin' good 
 I done made it out the hood 
 Think I'm goin' back? 
 I wish a motherfucker would 
 Yeah, they say I got the city on fire 
 I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, whoa 
 Really doe, like really doe 
 Really doe, like really doe 
 They say I got the city on fire 
 I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, whoa 
 Really doe, like really doe 
 Really doe, like really doe 
 Still wicked as Aleister, Crowley niggas know me well 
 For heaven's sake, I'm the GOAT, you haters can go to hell 
 When you're getting money, nigga, every day is sunny 
 I'ma act an ass on that donkey, let her pull my ponytail 
 Second grade, took my mama weddin' ring, took that bitch 
 To show-and-tell, now I'm married to the game to no avail 
 Grounded me for like a month, now I'm gettin' high as fuck 
 Employer tryna write me up, but now I'm a writer 
 With ambitions of a rider, and half the shit on my rider I don't even want 
 The Fanta's for us, the Henny's for the sluts (chyeah) 
 Givenchy bikers with the rev rips 
 Balmain badmon, Bathing Ape on my dick 
 Paid by the Bloods, raised by the Crips 
 Soulo Ho3 the prophecies, atrocities, exhibition 
 Oh yeah, now a nigga livin' good 
 But good could be better I wish a motherfucker would 
 Yeah, they say I got the city on fire 
 I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, whoa 
 Really doe, like really doe 
 Really doe, like really doe 
 They say I got the city on fire 
 I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, whoa 
 Really doe, like really doe 
 Really doe, like really doe 
 Life is like an appetite of truth and dare, I double dare ya 
 Life to end in vain before the end is near 
 See I can hear you crying 
 Silence sittin' in the dark 
 Holdin' crosses 'cross your heart 
 Sin is such a work of art 
 Watch out for the love lost 
 Bet a thousand, shoot a thousand 
 Things a nigga do for thousands 
 Made a million counting sheep 
 Gave it all to public housin' 
 Taking off to Abu Dhabi 
 Beamin' up the motor, Scotty 
 Talking to promoters, Scotty 
 Everybody know it's Gotti 
 Murder one, you've heard of them 
 The rev undid, the all day madness 
 Got it off the wipe it off, the evidence, the blood on mattress 
 Big power, big stages 
 My zoo cannot fit the cages 
 This booth is not used to fakin' 
 My crew just love confrontation 
 I chewed the face off the laces 
 I moved the weight from the waitress 
 I chef the pot that made poison 
 I cooked then kicked all the patients 
 My bitch is way beyond basic 
 That's life insurance, car insurance, good pussy insurance 
 Ay, look what we're enduring 
 Ay, ridin' in foreigns 
 Ay, K-Dot, four years, I got the same watch 
 But it's the real watch and that bitch fire 
 Speed Racer waitin' outside 
 The roof on it like a tank top 
 Countin' money, watchin' paint dry 
 When I'm done is when the rain stops, uh 
 They say I got the city on fire 
 I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, whoa 
 Really doe, like really doe 
 Really doe, like really doe 
 They say I got the city on fire 
 I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, whoa 
 Really doe, like really doe 
 Really doe, like really doe 
 Good, hood 
 I wish you motherfuckin' would 
 Listen, wish a motherfucker would, Brown 
 I had to put my foot down 
 It's like I'm popping a clutch 
 Your hate palpable, your jaw full of dust 
 You gon' keep talkin' or are we lockin' it up? 
 And I'm the type of nigga it ain't never been an honor to judge 
 You a mouse that the falcon picked up 
 So disrespect will get you checked like the top of the month 
 I was a liar as a kid so now I'm honest as fuck 
 And I never pass my mama no blunt 
 And kept my hair straight 
 Listen deadweight never been a problem to dunk 
 Look, I just broke up with my bitch 'cause we ain't argue enough 
 I keep it dirty as a spliff my uncle Alchemist puff 
 I strike a birdie on 'em, while I hit your mouth with the club 
 I wake up early on 'em, gettin' out the house is a must 
 It's like a sweaty pit, sweaty sick, countin' your dubs 
 Either that or you gon' catch me on a mountain with monks 
 Loungin', ask your girl why her mouth on my nuts 
 You've been the same motherfucker since 2001 
 Well it's the left-handed shooter, Kyle Lowry the pump 
 I'm at your house like, "Why you got your couch on my Chucks?" 
 Motherfucker
