Detroit so crazy, feel like Pac 
 Brenda's got a (baby) 
 Because everywhere I turn these girls don't learn 
 Get fucked by a nigga now her baby got a (baby) 
 A nigga be a nigga get locked or get hit up 
 Now you looking at that nigga like, "homeboy 
 I thought you was gonna help me I'm all by myself, see 
 When you gonna help me take care of this" (baby) 
 Put you on child support now you got to go to court 
 Now they hit your checks to take care of that (baby) 
 Thought about abortion but she couldn't afford it 
 And you was locked up, fighting them charges 
 Now you on the street, diapers ain't cheap 
 And you slang weed to take care of that (baby) 
 No education, the odds are slim of making it 
 So now you'll fuck with any nigga that'll bring the bacon in 
 Detroit so crazy, feel like Pac 
 Brenda's got a (baby) 
 Everywhere I look, young girl up in them books 
 Virginity took, now she 'bout to have a (baby) 
 She depends on welfare, (?) and her health care 
 'Cause nobody else care, 'cause 2Pac ain't there 
 Dropped outta high school, tried to go to night school 
 Got a GED to take care of that (baby) 
 Now she smoke blunts on the block and her feet ain't never washed 
 Tryin' a get someone to watch her (baby) 
 Have a baby in your teens, grown nobody want ya 
 Because ain't nobody tryin' a be a damn step-father 
 Bitch you a bother, always you crazy 
 Get your ass in the house and watch your (baby) 
 So watch what you do, burns out at twenty-two 
 Any man you meet don't give a damn about you
