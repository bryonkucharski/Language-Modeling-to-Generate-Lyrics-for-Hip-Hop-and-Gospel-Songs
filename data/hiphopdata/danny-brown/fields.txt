Money talk, only broke people listen 
 Ain't gotta pot to piss in can't afford to pay attention 
 These unfamiliar niggas be expecting recognition 
 Respect the intellect let me continue on the mission 
 I used to walk through alleys, paths in the field 
 You know that one house where Kenneth use to live 
 Now its just another shortcut to the store 
 The TV in the window drew the line of what was rich and poor 
 Mommy gave me food stamps told me buy wonder bread 
 On the way these niggas jumped me, left me wit knots on my head 
 Went to school yesterday and to had leave early 
 'Cause niggas said they was gon' jump me at 3:30 
 All because I lived in the hood who they had beef with 
 And I ain't tell em, dog, I kept that shit a secret 
 But I can't really trip, niggas looked out for me 
 Them same niggas played me ain't around to tell the story 
 I'm just young nigga on the D.O.T. 
 With my headphones on and sack full of weed 
 Rhymes in my head thought nobody wanted to hear em 
 So I had the fiends hitting rocks like the Pilgrims 
 And where I lived, it was house, field, field 
 Field, field house, abandoned house, field, field 
 And where I lived, it was house, field, field 
 Field, field house, abandoned house, field, field 
 That nigga much sicker 
 That's why he pop them pills, sip lean, smoke swishers 
 Yea I'm doing drugs thought I never ever try 
 That had my eyes so dry, dog I wish I could cry 
 I'm fucking bad foreign bitches while you in the hood 
 Smoking on some dirt weed smelling like some fire wood 
 Sitting on porches of abandoned houses 
 Or sitting in the field on bed bug ridden couches 
 It's like they all forgot man nobody care about us 
 That why we all ways end up in prison instead of college 
 Living in the system working kitchen for chump change 
 Lost in the streets niggas playing that gun game 
 Where nobody wins just a bunch of mamas losing 
 Dead body in the field, nobody heard the shooting 
 We living in the streets where the options is limited 
 'Cause its burnt building instead of jobs and businesses 
 And where I lived, it was house, field, field 
 Field, field house, abandoned house, field, field 
 And where I lived, it was house, field, field 
 Field, field house, abandoned house, field, field
