I'm like Kubrick 
 With 2 bricks 
 And hoes on the strip 
 Off a 2 piece 
 A toothpick I flick 
 And I preach 
 Bout how I'm a get this money out here up in the streets 
 In the Caddy Ron Isley on between in the sheets 
 And a way a nigga work make a grip in a week 
 I'm a chill with this freak 
 Sniff a gram and a half 
 Plus her pussy juicier than Shalamar curl bag 
 While she draw me a bath 
 Roll a blunt then passed 
 Giggled and jiggled her booty 
 Couldn't do nothing but laugh 
 Credit cards separating 
 White lines on a mirror 
 Roll a 100 dollar bill 
 Now my sinus all clearer 
 Flat screen porn on 
 Watching Asa Akira 
 Nothing on but my pinky ring 
 Sniff when I get up 
 On the balcony drunk 
 Like the world is mine 
 Staggering inside with my robe untied 
 So fuck waiting round 
 Nigga I'm about to get it 
 Dog I'm tryna eat 
 So I'm staying in the kitchen 
 Hunched over the stove 
 Gotta water water whip it 
 Lost in the sauce but a nigga still stirring 
 Packing up them bags but a nigga ain't tripping 
 Lost in the sauce but a nigga still dipping 
 Lost on the sauce but a nigga ain't flipping 
 Cutting up the hard like the yard ain't filling 
 I'm like Spielberg 
 With ill words and hoes on that curb 
 Gotta screw loose 
 I'm cuckoo 
 Mentally disturbed 
 But still smart enough 
 To hit this bitch wit a rubber 
 And with ya wrinkle pussy 
 Hoe can't be ya lover 
 But I still get the head 
 If you swallow with bubbles 
 I'm a Linwood nigga I done traveled the world 
 Made a name for myself use to serve on the curb 
 Now my words worth a bird 
 I could front you a zip 
 Made a million in a year and I still ain't trip 
 Bout to put my niggas on make a million for them 
 Show you that you can make it without acting like them 
 Do you lil nigga go out there and just get it 
 Gotta have a hardback 
 Because these niggas gon' whip it 
 Do you lil nigga get up out there get it 
 Gotta have a hardback 
 Because these niggas gon' whip it 
 So fuck waiting round 
 Nigga I'm about to get it 
 Dog I'm tryna eat 
 So I'm staying in the kitchen 
 Hunched over the stove 
 Gotta water water whip it 
 Lost in the sauce but a nigga still stirring 
 Packing up them bags but a nigga ain't tripping 
 Lost in the sauce but a nigga still dipping 
 Lost on the sauce but a nigga ain't flipping 
 Cutting up the hard like the yard ain't filling
