Ayo 
 Long awaited, Debated 
 But fuck it here we are brah 
 Here to save the game just like memory card 
 Memory loss to cali dro 
 To Amsterdam, out on the patio 
 Rockin' like a Beatle I should record up in Abbey Road 
 Bet he flow talkin' that 
 Hoodrich, money talk 
 Hoodrich, Black male 
 With music that's always in the hood like crack sales 
 Or out in the burbs like E pills 
 He feels niggas can't fuck with him 
 Shows, plenty fans round the globe screamin' out you niggas can't fuck with him 
 (Yep yep) 
 Hit 'em with that new shit 
 Hittin' off a new chick 
 That want me in her mouth like a toothpick 
 Who flips better heat? See this shits timeless 
 While y'all niggas got bad timing like teen pregnancies 
 Better be, Better see 
 We comin' with better heat 
 Sittin' on some Kobe's 
 Smoking on a stogie 
 Bangin' Noreaga 
 When I'm done I light the bogie (what, what) 
 40 on the floor mat a leave ya holey moley 
 Banana in her tailpipe a make her Axel Foley 
 Eatin on perogies 
 Goose mixed with Sobe 
 Smokin' on a OZ 
 Pimpin' like a O.G 
 If you never knew me then you prolly never know me 
 Blade on me homey mask on like Shinobi 
 Ball so hard, gotta MVP trophy 
 Blow so much kush I forget the hoes that blow me 
 Thick white bitch slurp a nigga like Kirby 
 Hoes on a nigga and they all look thirsty 
 Say they 19 and they all look 30 
 Everyday clean y'all always dirty 
 Chronic coming in same bag as a turkey 
 Dark color purple and its tasting like Hershey
