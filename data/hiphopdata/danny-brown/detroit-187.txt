The way these bitches on my cock 
 You'd swear it was 1985 and Teen Wolf just dropped 
 And my name was Michael J. Fox 
 But no bitch, it's Danny Brown, I've got some weed up in my sock 
 So bitch get high with ya nigga 
 The sack I got is looking like some green caterpillars 
 But it smell like a skunk that's oh so defensive 
 These bitches suck my dick like it was moral incentive 
 I'm off the chain like broke nunchucks 
 From where these little niggas try to shoot you off that new Chucks 
 A little dark like wet nubuck 
 Describe my state of mind is inside the tomb of King Tut 
 Murders all the time is all I see 
 Detroit 187 on you niggas' TV 
 And I can first agree this beat kill a nigga no charges 
 Fuck a female MC and a pop artist 
 Oh baby, I like it raw 
 And my dick so big left stretch marks on her jaw 
 I'm so institutionalized 
 I wake up 6 AM because I think it's chow time 
 Borderline porcupine, a step from drinking turpentine 
 Just to wash down a plate of wack rappers rhymes 
 I got a mind in the cosmos 
 And if these niggas cold then I guess I'm osmosis 
 That be blowing on some potent, that these white boys be growing 
 While you niggas smoking something smelling like a tanning lotion 
 My concoctions could make world ending potions 
 These other rap niggas got lines I got encroachments 
 I get endorsements, so motherfuck your co-sign 
 Punch punchlines I'll punch rappers till your broke spine 
 'Member back in '09, I told 'em it was showtime 
 Now they pull they cam phones out when I go for mine 
 Light camera action, Hybrid be snapping 
 'Cause the days of no tissue had to wipe with wet napkins 
 Smear up the classifieds, know it sound trife 
 But to be honest, a metaphor for my life, stop 
 Chip$: 
 Buzzing off the barbiturates and amphetamines 
 Chase it with a forty ounce of Ready Clean 
 I swear I never ever smoke the better weed 
 Your bitch said I'm the swaggiest nigga she ever seen 
 Run up in your crib, two K's, one mag 
 Your girl get snatched like Cool J in I'm Bad 
 Cost to live, you ain't made enough 
 Guarantee bullet holes with a laser touch 
 European garments drape my body if I ain't hipstered up 
 If she smile with eye contact then the bitch will fuck 
 Homie gon' make me send them killers after him 
 Them niggas swing swords like World Fence Champions 
 You was popping pills and drinking liquor 
 Now you thinking you a gangsta killer 
 I leave you stanking nigga, laid down 
 Face down like you taking a planking picture 
 But I can keep the shots in the weapon 
 Put the bat to back of your leg 
 Grab your chin and the back of your head 
 And twist them shits in opposite directions
