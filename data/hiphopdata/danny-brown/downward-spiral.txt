I'm sweating like I'm in a rave 
 Been in this room for 3 days 
 Think I'm hearing voices 
 Paranoid and think I'm seeing ghost-es, oh shit 
 Phone keep ringing but I cut that shit off 
 Only time I use it when I tell the dealer drop it off 
 Had a threesome last night, ain't matter what it cost 
 Couldn't it get hard, tried to stuff it in soft 
 Had to fuck 'em both raw, keep my fingers crossed 
 Been grinding on my teeth so long it's swelling up my jaw 
 Nothing on but my bathrobe and pinky ring 
 Your worst nightmare for me is a normal dream 
 And if I learned anything 
 Is don't nod off with ya motherfucking cigarette burning 
 Knocking on my door but I won't answer 
 Residue on mirrors, Jojo dancer 
 And it's a downward spiral 
 Gotta figure it out (out) 
 I gotta figure it out (out) 
 I gotta figure it out 
 'Cause it's the downward spiral 
 I gotta figure it out (out) 
 Gotta figure it out (out) 
 I gotta figure it out 
 Everybody say, you got a lot to be proud of 
 Been high this whole time, don't realize what I done 
 'Cause when I'm all alone, feel like no one care 
 Isolate myself and don't go nowhere 
 Smoking blunt after blunt, till my eyes start burning 
 Hennessy straight got my chest like a furnace 
 Drowning frustrations in a ocean of sin 
 Thinking irrational, I have no emotions 
 Cold cold world, some might say 
 Freezing on the snow, brain feel a bit frostbit 
 Nauseous, don't know the last time I ate 
 But I eat these fucking rappers like fucking last steak 
 On death row, feel like I am 
 You never know, one day you're here, the next you're gone 
 So I put it all up in these songs... 
 And it's a downward spiral 
 Gotta figure it out (out) 
 I gotta figure it out (out) 
 I gotta figure it out 
 'Cause it's the downward spiral 
 I gotta figure it out (out) 
 Gotta figure it out (out) 
 I gotta figure it out
