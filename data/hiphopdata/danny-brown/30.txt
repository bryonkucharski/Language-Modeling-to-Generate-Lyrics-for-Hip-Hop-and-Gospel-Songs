Sent ya bitch a dick pic and now she need glasses 
 Turn your bitch Slick Rick right now if I flashed it 
 Ate a couple pills took the bud out the plastic 
 Flicking bogey ashes, bitch I stay blasted 
 Microphone Cassius, Magic with the sick shit 
 'Posed to been dead but bitch I'm still up in this bitch 
 Verbal herbal poison, words I contortion 
 Fucked a pregnant bitch, she saved money on her abortion 
 I feel like Billy Corgan in a church playing organ 
 Covering Too Short, smoking a Newport 
 Kurt hoped the drugs would make the pain go away 
 But all these thoughts up in my head made the sane go astray 
 Step inside a mind that revolves around the rhyme 
 And every time he close his eyes, visions of white lines 
 Dying in the arms of a blond blue eyed twenty-something 
 Don't know her name but the paramedics chest pumping 
 Thirty-something black male, OD'ed off of pills 
 That he wasn't prescribed but they took his life 
 Left behind a daughter that doesn't really even know him 
 'Cause her momma thought he wouldn't make a living off of poems 
 But it was a long journey on a rocky road 
 Had a hoody on and a jacket in the snow 
 Walking in the cold on the way to the studio 
 Nigga, that was just a couple years ago 
 Dropped a couple mixtapes on the net 
 And niggas tried to front like it wasn't all that 
 But guess what bitch I'm coming back 
 Guess what bitch I'm coming back 
 Signed to Fool's Gold and everything's all gnarly 
 Now these bitches want my number to get up in party 
 Came a long way from extension cords in the window 
 Borrowing neighbor's power just to plug up the Nintendo 
 Where the ovens never closed and stoves never off 
 Every winter so cold niggas sleeping wearing scarves 
 But I always tell myself that it's gonna get better 
 You know who you is, you the greatest rapper ever 
 So now the pressures on him to prove that voice right 
 Some people never know they goals, knew mine my whole life 
 So now his turn's up fixing up to bat 
 Pitching singles to the label when I use to pitch crack 
 I never learned to rap, always knew how 
 Ever since a nigga eight, knew what I would do now 
 When I turned twenty-eight they like what you gonna do now? 
 And now a nigga thirty so y'all don't think that hurt me 
 That the last ten years I been so fucking stressed 
 Tears in my eyes let me get this off my chest 
 The thought of no success got a nigga chasing death 
 Doing all these drugs in hopes of OD'ing next, triple X
