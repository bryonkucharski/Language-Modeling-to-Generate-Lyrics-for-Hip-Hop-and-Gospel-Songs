Have you ever been, uh, stiffed at work? 
 No, I've never been stiffed... at work 
 With a bat 
 Go dangerous on that cat 
 Go Traxman, hit it from the back 
 DJ Assault, bitch, let me bang 
 Bruiser Brigade, we run that train 
 Put that thang in her caboose 
 Only way you hang is with a noose 
 Beef with us, it ain't no truce 
 Y'all niggas lame, y'all ain't like us 
 Hanging with the devil off angel dust 
 For that money, in God we trust 
 All fall victim for greed and lust 
 Who you 'pose to trust when guns gone bust? 
 Living every day like it's the end 
 Just waking up, feelin' like a sin 
 Gotta keep a eye on your friends 
 'Cause everybody hungry in them streets 
 Nigga rob ya grandma for something to eat 
 Know it's fucked up, that's how it be 
 Growing up living everyday in the D 
 And it don't seem like shit gon' change 
 No time soon in the City of Boom 
 Doomed from the time we emerged from the womb 
 So to cope, drugs we consume 
 Here we go, now, here we go 
 Ain't no water, how a flower gon' grow? 
 Ain't no change, then how we gon' change? 
 No umbrella, we stuck in the rain 
 Dark clouds hanging all over our head 
 No sunshine and them showers be lead 
 Lighting up squares and them dots be red 
 Now ya best friend gets shot in the head, damn 
 Oh, you ain't know that 
 When it rain, when it pour, get your ass on the floor now 
 Oh, you ain't know that, did you? 
 Better duck when you hear them gunshots go off 
 Pop off when them shots go off 
 Knock off, you try to play me soft 
 Glocks all in yo face, dog 
 No baseball, better run home 
 Hit ya lung, blood on yo tongue 
 Exorcist, yo head get spun 
 Exodus, I might forget 
 Bitch, when it's time for your ass be done 
 You ain't heard it like this before 
 They don't do it like this no more 
 That get on up, that get on up 
 That get on up, up on the floor 
 You ain't heard it like this before 
 They don't do it like this no more 
 That get on up, that get on up 
 That get on up, up on the floor 
 Oh, you ain't know that 
 When it rain, when it pour, get your ass on the floor now 
 Oh, you ain't know that, did you? 
 When it rain, when it pour, get your ass on the floor now 
 Oh, you ain't know that 
 When it rain, when it pour, get your ass on the floor now 
 Oh, you ain't know that, did you? 
 When it rain, when it pour, get your ass on the floor now 
 Time for the percolator 
 Murder music orchestrator 
 Point blank hollow tip circulator 
 Your ass lucky if you on respirator 
 I'm like Vega rolling with that blade 
 Kid don't play, wanna catch that fade? 
 Shoot the house party up with them K's 
 Shut down when we hit the DJ 
 That Detroit shit, do the Rambisco 
 Minks and Gators, pistol the disco 
 Eating crawfish up in Fishbones 
 Heater off safety, watching the Pistons 
 Niggas get pissed on no-fly zone 
 Call Uncle Trick when you hit my home 
 Beef with him? Don't hit my phone 
 D vs. everybody, ain't no song 
 Coming from the city where them goons be lurking 
 Get caught slipping, yo ass will be hurting 
 That's for certain, yo ass be curtains 
 Young niggas out there puttin' that work in 
 On you scoring for a pair of Jordans 
 Whole damn city probably got a couple warrants 
 Why the county jail always stay crowded 
 They don't give a fuck, they just go pop 
 Oh, you ain't know that 
 When it rain, when it pour, get your ass on the floor now 
 Oh, you ain't know that, did you? 
 Better duck when you hear them gunshots go off 
 Pop off and all them shots go off 
 Knock off, you're tryna play me soft 
 Glocks out in your face, dawg 
 No baseball, better run home 
 You ain't heard it like this before 
 They don't do it like this no more 
 That get on up, that get on up 
 That get on up, up on the floor 
 You ain't heard it like this before 
 They don't do it like this no more 
 That get on up, that get on up 
 That get on up, up on the floor 
 Oh, you ain't know that 
 When it rain, when it pour, get your ass on the floor now 
 Oh, you ain't know that, did you? 
 When it rain, when it pour, get your ass on the floor now 
 Oh, you ain't know that 
 When it rain, when it pour, get your ass on the floor now 
 Oh, you ain't know that, did you? 
 When it rain, when it pour, get your ass on the floor now
