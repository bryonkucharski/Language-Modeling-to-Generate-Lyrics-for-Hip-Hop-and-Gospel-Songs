Uh, yeah 
 Uh, yeah 
 Uh 
 Always wanna go 
 Always tell her yes, never tell her no 
 No, you think you know everything, but you don't 
 Wanna do the right thing, but you probably won't 
 So you chase the nightlife, blinded by the lights 
 Bottom of the empty glass, where you find life 
 Always left behind, because she think she right 
 Thinking that she grown but always needs your advice 
 And always in a situation that she need your help 
 But wouldn't help another, only care about herself 
 In your VIP, asking where the drink at 
 Calling her a groupie, you'd think she'd really think that 
 She just wanna hear that that ass look right 
 What you doing after this? Fuck tomorrow night 
 Wanna snort some blow? Pop a lot of pills? 
 Fucking when the sun come up, she don't feel 
 She wanna party all the time 
 Party all the time, she wanna party all the time 
 She wanna party all the time 
 Party all the time, she wanna party all the time 
 She wanna party all the time 
 Party all the time, she wanna party all the time 
 She wanna party all the time 
 Party all the time, she wanna party all the time 
 Skip semester, classes have passed 
 Say she going back, but she ain't going back 
 'Cause time ain't waiting for a future on hold 
 At glass tables, on her knees sniffing coke 
 Tell her get a hold, grip on life 
 Rather fill her cup up, liquor with no ice 
 Twice had an abortion, young, dumb, misfortune 
 Rate that she going, she might be whorin' 
 Signs she ignoring, but doesn't recognize 
 Blind to what's occurring, what's going through your mind? 
 Seven days a week, same shit every morning 
 Calling her a cab from different niggas' apartments 
 Wanting her to change, but she won't, dog 
 Just another number in a fucking call log 
 Lost in the fog, head in the smoke 
 Laughing at the world 'cause her life is a joke 
 She wanna party all the time 
 Party all the time, she wanna party all the time 
 She wanna party all the time 
 Party all the time, she wanna party all the time 
 She wanna party all the time 
 Party all the time, she wanna party all the time 
 She wanna party all the time 
 Party all the time, she wanna party all the time
