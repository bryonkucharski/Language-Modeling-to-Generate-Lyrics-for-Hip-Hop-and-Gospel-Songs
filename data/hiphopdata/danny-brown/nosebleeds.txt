Business cards from her attorney 
 Got probation 'cause the parents paid the money 
 Six month rehab, but she back at it 
 Reflexion stare at it, but she can't look at it 
 She wiped out the debit card, owing on the credit 
 For student loans, they call her phone, but she don't sweat it 
 Cocaine on counter tops, separate in lines 
 Every time she do it, she says this her last time 
 Chasing that high from the very first time 
 Back in her dorm room in 2009 
 Never thought this relationship would come this far 
 Rolled singles in her nose, I'm blade sniffing hard 
 In night club stalls, her and her friends sniff it all 
 Never sleep in random dude's apartments, missed calls 
 Unreplied texts from her boyfriend 
 Feeling like any second the world can end 
 And when it freeze her, it make her pussy wet 
 Face rushing, going numb, nipples hard on them breasts 
 Sniffing till it drip, back of the class, blood running down her lips
