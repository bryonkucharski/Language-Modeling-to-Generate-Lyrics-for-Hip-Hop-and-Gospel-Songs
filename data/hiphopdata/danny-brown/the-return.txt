See they think I'm a fuck nigga 
 But if they ever see me then they might have to duck, nigga 
 Like what, nigga? 
 Before your ass can answer get your whole shit bust, nigga 
 Done rose out them ashes, drinking Fiji water 
 Wanna pull me in that fire while I'm tryna feed my daughter 
 Wanna snatch my momma's plate, and tell her she can't eat 
 And we gone have us some discrepancies right here in this skreet 
 Because the weak don't speak, get left in silence 
 And when you don't listen, gotta speak with violence 
 And duct tape the grandmama, strip a man of all his honor 
 Out here tryna be a G, now you wish you a goner 
 I walk with the Gods with the tongues for the devil 
 Tryna keep a nigga thirsty, so for rain I pray mercy 
 The return of the gangster 'cause niggas don't believe 
 I roll hotter than my sleeve, leave a nigga in the street 
 The return of the gangster 'cause niggas got bills 
 This rap shit don't work, then its back to selling krills 
 Return of the gangster 'cause niggas want that real 
 Want that old Danny Brown but nigga I'm like chill 
 The return of the gangster fuck a hipster squeeze a trigger 
 You got me fucked up, I'm a hood-ass nigga 
 Eastside niggas keep roaches in the ashtray 
 Twenty thousand out the public housing on a bad day 
 Drop it in the pot, if it ain't locking that's some bad yay 
 Tryna save my soul I wish the lord would meet me half way 
 Devil on my shoulder as I'm whipping up this yola 
 And that motor hit the rotor ship this blow to Minnesota 
 Only option is a shoot out if the police pull me over 
 This shit get real as shit that's on your Playstation controller 
 Call of Duty ass nigga, dick in the booty ass nigga 
 Don't po' up roll no dough up and I don't get no cash with ya 
 Feel like fuck the world it ain't no friends up in this business 
 Fuck my label show them that I'm the real realest nigga in it 
 Gangsta Gibbs, bitch 
 It's the return of the gangsta, thanks ta' 
 These phony ass wannabe thug perpetrators and wankstas 
 Your white tee turn to tie-dye, nigga I red paint ya 
 Won't stress or cry about it, 'cause it's not in my nature 
 Said, it's the return of the gangsta, thanks ta' 
 These phony ass wannabe thug perpetrators and wankstas 
 Your white tee turn to tie-dye, nigga I red paint ya 
 Won't stress or cry about it, 'cause it's not in my nature 
 Fucker
