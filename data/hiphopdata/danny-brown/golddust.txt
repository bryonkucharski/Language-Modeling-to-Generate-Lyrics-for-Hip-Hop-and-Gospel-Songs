Bust it open 
 Flake looking like gold dust 
 Nigga get a whiff of this uncut 
 Bloody Marys at brunch 
 From last night still drunk 
 Popped a Adderall nigga that was my lunch 
 And I gotta hunch 
 Roll another blunt 
 Call some hoes up nigga let's do some bumps 
 Caught up in the whirlwind 
 Life took a tail spin 
 Hid behind designer shades 
 Life of sin 
 Lost control 
 Don't have a soul 
 Myself I don't know no more 
 Numbing up with drugs 
 To suppress these feelings 
 Praying to the heavens 
 Letting these devils get the best of me 
 Nigga what's the recipe for a good time 
 A whole lot of liquor while you doing coke lines 
 Residue on my mustache 
 How could it last 
 Roll a hundred dollar bill 
 Nigga blow cash 
 Can't nobody tell me no 
 Nigga pass me that blow 
 Got to the point ain't gotta buy drugs 
 Niggas just give to 'em to me 
 Yeah they think they showing love 
 And that's what's up 
 Kinda fucked up 
 Now I do way it more then I use to 
 Have no clues 
 All the false alarms 
 Where most would of died 
 But my tolerance strong 
 Been cursed all alone 
 Whole family addicts 
 Floating through my bloodstream 
 Like I gotta have it 
 Tried to quit a few times 
 But it didn't work out 
 Can you understand 
 What my life is about 
 'Cause I think you don't 
 So take a step inside 
 A mind so horrific 
 Images that I hide 
 Take look inside 
 Scare you for life 
 This is the way 
 Nigga step inside 
 Mimosa for breakfast 
 With a thick hoe from Texas 
 Got good karma 
 Feel the persona 
 Got the Hermes towel while I'm up in the sauna 
 Smoking on ganja 
 Tasting like caramel 
 Ass so fat think she get it from her momma 
 Came along way hitting thots in spots 
 Now I fuck porn stars I done jerked off and watched 
 Spending racks up in Bergdorf 
 Bitches take ya shirt off 
 Took a couple molly's 
 Now they wanna have a twerk off 
 Guess who the judge 
 Why they hold the grudge 
 Me I done got it on my own out the mud 
 Will it all last 
 Will it all last 
 Roll a hundred dollar bill 
 Nigga blow cash 
 Will it all last 
 Will it all last 
 Roll a hundred dollar bill 
 Blowing money fast
