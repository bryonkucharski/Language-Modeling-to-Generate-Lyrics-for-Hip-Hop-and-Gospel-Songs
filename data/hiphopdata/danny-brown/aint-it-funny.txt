Verbal couture 
 Parkour 
 With the metaphors 
 The flow house of horror 
 Dead bolted with metal doors 
 Grinch bitch 
 Six sense 
 With a nose drip 
 Mind skydive 
 Sniffing bumps 
 In the cockpit 
 Locksmith of Hip Hop 
 Appraisal the wrist watch 
 The rocks 'bout the size 
 As the teeth in Chris Rock's mouth 
 Sock out the mic 
 Prototype for Adderall 
 Your work killing fiends 
 'Cause you cut it with Fentanyl 
 So much coke 
 Just to sniff need a ski lift 
 Flip your table over 
 If you cut it with the bullshit 
 Nose bleeds red carpets 
 But it just blend in 
 Snapping pictures 
 Feeling my chest being sunk in 
 Live a fast life 
 Seen many die slowly 
 Unhappy when they left 
 So I try to seize the moment 
 Funny how it happens 
 Who ever would imagine 
 That jokes on you 
 But Satan the one laughing 
 Ain't it funny how it happens 
 Ain't it 
 Ain't it funny how it happens 
 Ain't it 
 Ain't it funny how it happens 
 Ain't it 
 I can sell honey to a bee 
 In the fall time 
 Make trees 
 Take back they leaves 
 Octopus in a straight jacket 
 Savage with bad habits 
 Broke serving fiends 
 Got rich became a addict 
 Ain't it funny how it happens 
 Who would ever would imagine 
 Nose running right now 
 Could ya pass me a napkin 
 Managed to somehow 
 To have the upper advantage 
 Panic when the drugs are gone 
 And nobody is answering 
 Ain't it funny how it happens 
 Ain't it 
 Ain't it funny how it happens 
 No way to mask it 
 A lot became has beens 
 Rolling up that 100 dollar bill 
 Till they cash in 
 Thinks it gone last 
 Going too fast 
 Man it's fucked up 
 Ain't it funny how it happens 
 Ain't it funny how it happens 
 Ain't it 
 Ain't it funny how it happens 
 Ain't it 
 Ain't it funny how it happens 
 Ain't it 
 Ain't it funny how it happen 
 Upcoming heavy traffic 
 Say ya need to slow down 
 'Cause you feel yourself crashing 
 Staring in the devil face 
 But ya can't stop laughing 
 Staring in the devil face 
 But ya can't stop laughing 
 It's a living nightmare 
 That most of us might share 
 Inherited in our blood 
 It's why we stuck in the mud 
 Can't quit the drug use 
 Or the alcohol abuse 
 Even if I wanted to 
 Tell you what I'm gonna do 
 I'ma wash away my problems 
 With this bottle of Henny 
 Anxiety got the best of me 
 So popping them Xannies 
 Might need rehab 
 But to me that shit pussy 
 Pray for me y'all 
 'Cause I don't know what coming to me 
 Bought a 8 ball of coke 
 And my nigga on the way 
 Got 3 hoes with him 
 And they all tryna play 
 Ain't it funny how it happens 
 Who ever would imagine 
 Jokes on you 
 But Satan the one laughing 
 Ain't it funny how it happens 
 Ain't it 
 Ain't it funny how it happens 
 Ain't it 
 Ain't it funny how it happens 
 Ain't it
