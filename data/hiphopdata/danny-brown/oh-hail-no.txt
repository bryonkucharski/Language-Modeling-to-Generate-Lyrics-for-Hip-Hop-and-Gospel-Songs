Ever notice when you talk I just cut myself? 
 On some ultimate fuck you, go fuck yourself 
 Like that was so heartfelt, you really touched yourself 
 I loved the part where you cried, I liked nothing else 
 Who me? Every breath is a criminal, critical breach 
 Bloody guns, speech, beat minimalisimo 
 Make you spin like you sniffing that god particle 
 That purple cloak of the dusk, an odd article 
 Originator decay, caterwaul brand, dawn treader rising 
 Hollow man bop, gliding 
 Shuffle through the tides of slime smiling 
 Could be the high or just mind control dying 
 Fuck it throw me on the problem pile 
 I'm a grin from the garbage, stained parchment 
 Peeking out of my blinds in the apartment 
 Waiting for that "Hark hear that archangel calling?" 
 Pocket full of air plus nothing to wear 
 I've been told I was put here to fail 
 But never ask me to hail 
 Never ask me to hail 
 I'm strapped in shaved head in an electric chair 
 With a grin going out with a flair 
 But never ask me to hail 
 Never ask me to hail 
 Jesus turned water to wine, I turn liquor to ur-ine 
 Sex with one whore is deplorable I need four at a time 
 Maybe I'm lost in the grind, conscious of all I desire 
 Forcibly caused to be normal, bonded and tossed in the fire 
 Cross hairs of corporate design, cogs that all move in align- 
 Meant to be something other than this but I think I forgot 
 Shyamalan twist in the plot, camelot sword from the rock 
 No I won't piss in your pot, life put that bishop in pac 
 Visceral, villianous, vindictated by venomous vibes 
 Vicious, concealing, my mental illness by willing a smile 
 Endless, intentions to climb, uphill and piss in the sky 
 (Brooklyn is up in this motherfucker so suck on our) cock 
 Pocket full of air plus nothing to wear 
 I've been told I was put here to fail 
 But never ask me to hail 
 Never ask me to hail 
 I'm strapped in shaved head in an electric chair 
 With a grin going out with a flair 
 But never ask me to hail 
 Never ask me to hail 
 Check! 
 The natural magician, these rappers' nutrition 
 I'm shitting on their writtens while I'm pissing on their freestyles 
 My patterns are argyle, your's more checker board 
 My lecture is Lecter, your texture is pocket protector 
 With techniques I take off your sector 
 Inspector Gadget with the ratchet 
 Bitch won a beauty pageant, bought her ass a rabbit 
 But not a furry bunny bitch I'm all about these moneys 
 Ah! Tummy empty and I'm dazed when sunny 
 So I had to sell crack 'cause I ain't wanna be bummy 
 Granny gave me couple dollars while she played gin and rummy 
 Off that Mobb Deep shit had me saying dunny 
 Done. This nigga here is not a dummy 
 Look at all that he has done, you niggas feeling crummy 
 Gummy bear you running where? It's like a fat bitch running a hundred stairs 
 I'm Rick Flair, with thick hair 
 Yelling out "Woo!" getting head in the director's chair
