Remember one time dog, this fiend owed the boss 
 Put peanut butter on her pussy, let his pits lick it off 
 Back when I was living on Flanders 
 Seen another dope fiend beat another with a hammer 
 Remember at the park, seen a nigga at the payphone 
 Got rocked in his dome, mama picked me up and ran home 
 Was like fucking seven years old 
 When I first seen a fiend try to light a rock off the stove 
 Damn near burned his top lip off, so my mind ticked off 
 Desensitized to a lot of things, mind would drift off 
 Wish it was what I seen on TV 
 I snapped outta that, unc' beating on my auntie 
 Gunshots outside was sorta like fireworks 
 We know they ain't fireworks, it's December 21st 
 Cold winter with a kerosene heater 
 On the couch so cold, can't take off your sneakers 
 And it's torture 
 Look in my mind and see the horrors 
 All the shit that I've seen, nigga it's torture 
 Look in my mind and see the horrors 
 All the shit that I've seen, nigga it's torture 
 Look in my mind and see the horrors 
 All the shit that I've seen 
 I feel like a prisoner of war 
 Reacting sporadically to what the mind absorb 
 Probably need a shrink, can't get a wink 
 So I smoke a lot of kush and pop a Xanax to sleep 
 Close my eyes, look up, fiend said one for eight 
 Can tell that I scared him by the look on my face 
 Reached in my pocket served him nervous as a surgeon 
 Can't believe where I'm at, s'posed be writing verses 
 Heard a knock at the door, 'nother fiend wanted fo' 
 Gave him what he came for, told him go to the sto' 
 Let me get a box a box of Swishers, Faygo Cola 
 Gave his ass another stone now guess what it's over 
 He ain't come back, before I could look back 
 I heard the wood on the door crack 
 And they yelling "Police!" 
 With this work up in my jeans, man this a bad dream 
 And it's torture 
 Look in my mind and see the horrors 
 All the shit that I've seen, nigga it's torture 
 Look in my mind and see the horrors 
 All the shit that I've seen, nigga it's torture 
 Look in my mind and see the horrors 
 All the shit that I've seen
