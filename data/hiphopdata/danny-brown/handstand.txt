Check! 
 I will eat on them pajamas, bite all on it like piranha 
 When it comes to that vagina, baby girl you could be my diner 
 Just lean back and get it, won't stop licking till you tell me quit 
 Let me suck on that clit while you follow my head 
 Baby girl, I know you're with it 
 Ball with me, fall back on that outfit or something 
 And I love your thighs I can't deny 
 Work it like Twerk team and I think my dick want to be the sound 
 Rolling balls till my dick hard, didn't say heard like a missed call 
 I don't really look like I'm tryna fuck 
 And I probably won't care about her tomorrow 
 Damn it ho, what you tryna do 
 "Pour a deuce let's get chopped and screwed" 
 Fool's Gold, and you know, and Balmain mark down the shit 
 Smoking on that freeze, nigga, got a nigga amnesia, nigga 
 Comatose and I need a dose, wanna get behind that ass you got 
 Dipping to that Diplo, throw it right when they play tonight 
 Looking right, thinking of dimes and I think I am gon' fuck her tonight 
 She lookin' ready to go, and fosho ain't gon stop 
 With her hands on the floor and her feet on the wall 
 Pop the pussy on a handstand, handstand 
 Pop the pussy on a handstand, handstand 
 (Shake that ass for a gangsta nigga) 
 Pop the pussy on a handstand, handstand 
 Pop the pussy on a handstand, handstand 
 (Shake that ass for a hipster nigga) 
 Hands on the floor and her feet on the wall 
 And she pop that pussy like she ain't afraid to fall 
 When her hands on the floor and her feet on the wall 
 And she pop that pussy like she ain't afraid to fall 
 Let me see what you're working with, don't stop girl keep twerking it 
 I'm watching you and I'm wondering if you could do that with my dick in it 
 She throw it back like a fire ball, hit it up, order like a house call 
 Want to eat the cat, be from the back, then give that ho a mouthful 
 Hundred dollar pills we rolling, ass in the air she working 
 Don't care when we rolling, don't care when they rolling 
 Hundred dollar pills we rolling, ass in the air she working 
 Don't care when we rolling, don't feel when we rolling 
 Pop the pussy on hand stand, record that on my Handycam 
 That uncut, ludicrous, feel that monkey I go Orangutan 
 You ain't met a nigga like this before, eat it from the back, suck on ya toes 
 The way I put my mouth on it, that pussy was under a mistletoe 
 Throw it back to that A-Trak, one hour to that Baauer 
 Now she got my dick hard, and I want to fuck her in the shower 
 Looking ready to go, oh for sure, I ain't go soft 
 Got her hands on floor, and her feet on the wall 
 Pop the pussy on a handstand, handstand 
 Pop the pussy on a handstand, handstand 
 (Shake that ass for a gangsta nigga) 
 Pop the pussy on a handstand, handstand 
 Pop the pussy on a handstand, handstand 
 (Shake that ass for a hipster nigga) 
 Hands on the floor and her feet on the wall 
 And she pop that pussy like she ain't afraid to fall 
 When her hands on the floor and her feet on the wall 
 And she pop that pussy like she ain't afraid to fall
