Hé bien peut-être l'oiseau 
 L'oiseau qui dormait en chacun de nous 
 S'élèvera 
 Hipster by heart but I can tell you how the streets feel 
 Everybody thirsty and they looking for a refill 
 If the gang eating, guns barking at your doggie bag 
 Get took out for your take out now you carry out 
 Murder by delivery, married at the paramount 
 I just coughed up a fair amount of niggas might air it out 
 Judge a book by cover so we never educated 
 It ain't about racists poor and rich segregated 
 Just to get the bacon dawg, you gotta go HAM 
 Use to be lost 'til I found who I am 
 But it took the hook to eat the palm on my hands 
 Locked tryna get real creative with the spam 
 Locked in a jam 'cause a nigga serve butter 
 Just to get a little bread, had to keep the mayo smothered 
 All I really wanted was to overdub my vocals 
 But no one ever thought that I would take it past local 
 High a'top a totem man somebody shoulda told 'em 
 That if money grew on trees, being rich is dime a dozen 
 So I'm smoking by my lonely 
 By my goddamn self, I don't need your help, homie 
 'Cause don't nobody really know me 
 Said nobody really know me 
 See that's going on a limb 
 And I used to sell trees, and I used to rock Timbs 
 Radiohead shit, fiends with the Bends 
 Back when Granny used to tell me "Stay Out of In" 
 Letting the cold air out, tryna know my whereabouts 
 Gone for three days and nobody ever heard about 
 How I got these Jordans, but that ain't too important 
 When I got a bitch pregnant and I'm stacking for abortion 
 And all I really wanted was to give myself a portion 
 Lit up off the Henny got a nigga self absorbing 
 Smoking on a bogie, no bud style, who can I trust now? 
 Lady snitch and got the whole block down 
 Now we gon' eat now, no rebound 
 When your boxed out, belly of the beast now 
 Now you got me feeling trapped and I can't look back 
 When the road ahead is gold and the past is made of ash 
 And I'm going through the trash tryna find a little treasure 
 Living for the better tryna get myself together 
 So I'm smoking by my lonely 
 By my goddamn self, I don't need your help, homie 
 'Cause don't nobody really know me 
 Said nobody really know me
