Dip, I dip, you dip, dip, I dip, you dip, I dip 
 Dip, I dip, you dip, dip, I dip, you dip, I dip 
 Dip, you dip, I dip, dip, you dip, I dip, you dip 
 Dip, I dip, you dip, dip, I dip, you dip, I dip 
 Don't let me into my zone, don't let me into my zone 
 Don't let me into my zone, you haters leave me alone 
 I say, don't let me into my zone, don't let me into my zone 
 Don't let me into my zone, you haters leave me alone 
 Like Lieutenant Dan, I'm rolling 
 Back to back, I keep on smoking 
 Eyes keep shaking and I can't stay focused 
 I'm fucked if you niggas ain't noticed 
 I'm sweating, but I'm cold 
 Mouth all dry, but I got a runny nose 
 I just bought me a water bottle, chug that down 
 But I think I need me some more 
 And I keep feeling like I'm gon' faint 
 But fuck that, nigga, pass me that drank 
 I done drunk too much 
 I might throw up in a hotel bathroom sink 
 Bitch, I'm blown, I'm zooted 
 Can't believe that I'm even moving 
 Off a half a gram of molly, we about to go party 
 And I don't know what I'm doing 
 Dip, I dip, you dip, dip, I dip, you dip, I dip 
 Dip, I dip, you dip, dip, I dip, you dip, I dip 
 Dip, you dip, I dip, dip, you dip, I dip, you dip 
 Dip, I dip, you dip, dip, I dip, you dip, I dip 
 Don't let me into my zone, don't let me into my zone 
 Don't let me into my zone, you haters leave me alone 
 I say, don't let me into my zone, don't let me into my zone 
 Don't let me into my zone, you haters leave me alone 
 Now all these rappers talking 'bout that molly 
 Bet a million dollars, these niggas ain't dipping 
 Pure MDMA, put it in a shot 
 We talking 'bout crystals 
 Been thizzing hard up all day 
 Rest in peace to Mac Dre 
 Throw up the T, scratch on my face 
 Do the Thizzle Dance up in the place 
 I'm grinding on your bitch 
 While I'm grinding on my teeth 
 Don't give a flying fuck 
 So right now you don't want beef 
 I'm blown, I'm zooted 
 Can't believe that I'm even moving 
 Off a half a gram of molly, we about to go party 
 And I don't know what I'm doing 
 Dip, I dip, you dip, dip, I dip, you dip, I dip 
 Dip, I dip, you dip, dip, I dip, you dip, I dip 
 Dip, you dip, I dip, dip, you dip, I dip, you dip 
 Dip, I dip, you dip, dip, I dip, you dip, I dip 
 Don't let me into my zone, don't let me into my zone 
 Don't let me into my zone, you haters leave me alone 
 I say, don't let me into my zone, don't let me into my zone 
 Don't let me into my zone, you haters leave me alone 
 She licked it off my index 
 Before that she been wet 
 Now she licking on her best friend 
 While they suck me watching sunset 
 That's right bitch, we ain't done yet 
 Lifting up her sundress 
 It kicked in she licking 
 Before I blink, she undressed 
 Molly make her feel good 
 It's a feeling, she can't explain 
 But obvious, we got some problems 
 So bitch, let's kill that pain 
 I'm blown, I'm zooted 
 Can't believe I'm even moving 
 Off a half a gram of molly, we about to go party 
 And I don't know what I'm doing 
 Dip, I dip, you dip, dip, I dip, you dip, I dip 
 Dip, I dip, you dip, dip, I dip, you dip, I dip 
 Dip, you dip, I dip, dip, you dip, I dip, you dip 
 Dip, I dip, you dip, dip, I dip, you dip, I dip 
 Don't let me into my zone, don't let me into my zone 
 Don't let me into my zone, you haters leave me alone 
 I say, don't let me into my zone, don't let me into my zone 
 Don't let me into my zone, you haters leave me alone
