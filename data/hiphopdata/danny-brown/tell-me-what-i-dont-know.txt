Street smart, Ph.D 
 Dropped out for a slanging degree 
 9 on me, keep the devils off me 
 'Cause we was living in hell, couldn't afford property 
 Lil nigga gettin' frontin' from OGs 
 Oz of reggie bagged up in the Pelle 
 In a school hallways on a burnout celly 
 Leaving out of class early, caught a sale for 20 
 How long will it last? 
 Never ending race, chasin' cash 
 One lane going wrong way till I crash 
 Teacher find my sack, going nowhere fast 
 Tell me what I don't know 
 Last night homie got killed at the liquor store 
 Shot my nigga on the way to get a Swisher 
 Breaking down the weed when the call got received 
 We was so ambitious 
 All we really wanted was new Jordans and some bitches 
 Flashing bankrolls in the club taking pictures 
 Thinking we was grown men, really lil' niggas 
 Jumping dope fiends that's owing us for credit 
 Taking turns catching sales things copacetic 
 Slice your tomato if you owe us for the lettuce 
 Running through the sack of D sorta like Jerome Bettis 
 Naive to the outcome 
 'Cause hit the block, hit the stash and they found some 
 Lock us all up for a bag and some pistols 
 Now we in the county writing letters I miss you 
 Tell me what I don't know 
 Hook raid came through kickin' down the front door 
 Now we facin' judge, got us sitting at the court 
 Gave us all probation now we smokin' Newports 
 Tell me what I don't know 
 Hook raid came through kickin' down the front door 
 Now we facin' judge, got us sitting at the court 
 Gave us all probation now we smokin' Newports 
 Tell me what I don't know 
 Tell me what I don't know 
 Tell me what I don't know 
 Tell me what I don't know 
 And we was so gung ho 
 Wet a nigga up like he forgot his poncho 
 On the block all day chasin' that cilantro 
 Hook raid kickin' on the front door 
 Shit is like a cycle 
 You get out, I go in, this is not the life for us 
 Shit is like a cycle 
 You get out, I go in, this is not the life for us 
 Tell me what I don't know 
 Last night homie got killed at the liquor store

 Tell me what I don't know 
 Tell me what I don't know 
 Tell me what I don't know 
 Tell me what I don't know 
 Tell me what I don't know 
 Tell me what I don't know 
 Tell me what I don't know 
 Tell me what I don't know 
 Tell me what I don't know
