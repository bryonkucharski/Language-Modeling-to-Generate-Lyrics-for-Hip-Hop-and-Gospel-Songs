Go 
 (Bitch, I'm way up here) 
 Can't hear what you're saying 
 Go on with all that hate 
 So it's fuck you, pay me, I said 
 (Bitch, I'm way up here) 
 Can't hear what you're saying 
 Go on with all that hate 
 So it's fuck you, pay me, I said 
 (Bitch, I'm way up here) 
 You a tattoo to a statue 
 Run a mic like Michelangelo draw, too 
 While I turn this bitch into Saw II 
 (Bitch, I'm way up here) 
 And you down there on that totem pole 
 I'm on the road and I'll fuck your girl 
 And I'll put this dick up in a whirl 
 (Bitch, I'm way up here) 
 And you down there like a little nigga 
 I'll buy you up on that rent card 
 You still around? You better thank God 
 (Bitch, I'm way up here) 
 I ain't worry what's down there 
 I'll take a step, look on my shoe 
 And you'll be splattered everywhere 
 (Bitch, I'm way up here) 
 Can't hear what none of y'all talking 'bout 
 I'm on top of my mountain 
 And y'all just started climbing rocks step 
 (Bitch, I'm way up here) 
 Can't hear what you're saying 
 Go on with all that hate 
 So it's fuck you, pay me, I said 
 (Bitch, I'm way up here) 
 Don't care what down there doing 
 'Cause up here, up here, down there, down there 
 And you don't moving how I'm moving 
 (Bitch, I'm way up here) 
 Can't hear what you're saying 
 Go on with all that hate 
 So it's fuck you, pay me, I said 
 (Bitch, I'm way up here) 
 Can't hear what you're saying 
 Go on with all that hate 
 So it's fuck you, pay me 
 (Bitch, I'm way up here) 
 Yeah, come on girl, is you down? 
 You with it? I'm with it 
 Go on 'head, go down, uh 
 (Bitch, I'm way up here) 
 Puffing pot on a mountain top 
 Dipping in that bag 
 White girl on my countertop 
 (Bitch, I'm way up here) 
 Drop it like it's hot, ho 
 I ain't move no birds 
 But she in love with my cock, though 
 (Bitch, I'm way up here) 
 Looking down on you little niggas 
 Got a 16 with a seal on it 
 Shot glass with a pill in it 
 (Bitch, I'm way up here) 
 Y'all all under my telescope 
 So much that I'm squinting, you ain't snitching 
 But you can tell I'm dope 
 (Bitch, I'm way up here) 
 Hah, can't hear what you saying 
 Smoking on that strong, strong 
 Like a Super Saiyan, saying 
 (Bitch, I'm way up here) 
 Soulo, yeah, HiiiPower 
 Top Dawg, all dogs go to heaven, not y'all 
 (Bitch, I'm way up here) 
 (Bitch, I'm way up here)
