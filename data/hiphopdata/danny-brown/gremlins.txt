I know some lil' niggas that thirst cream 
 That pop a bitch on camera and we ain't talking 'bout twerk team 
 Shooting up cribs turning porches to smokescreens 
 Mama smoking nightmares chasing her pipe dream 
 Hard to give advice behind a monitored call 
 So his limits Senim Sillas, 'cause his pop behind walls 
 School become a free meal, streets become a cheap thrill 
 Same prices pa paid, he gon' pay a cheap deal 
 Hourglasss empty but he looking for a refill 
 Revolver break dancing, yeah, he make that bitch windmill 
 Guess he's just a psycho in the city of the Chrysler 
 Everybody living spiteful, nigga looking just to ice you 
 So we living hostile just to cop some Aeropostale 
 Trenchcoat Mafia, for a lil' Hollister 
 Gotta get his dollars up, so we hit the dice game 
 Lost all his re-up, now he rob the dice game 
 Probation violation, call his ass the son of Satan 
 Got these old niggas scared, like it's Crystal Lake and Jason 
 'Cause they been through cases, they ain't tryna go back 
 Fresh meat up on the street, he give a fuck about that 
 Snatching Cartie's downtown, wear 'em same damn week 
 Tryna get the same bitches on the same damn street 
 Rob a ho-ass nigga at the same damn time 
 At the same damn time, at the same damn time 
 'Cause they gremlins (Gremlin) 
 He just wanna smoke some kush 
 And fuck with some hoes at the mall 
 For that shit, he wished it all, baby face and all 
 My lil' nigga gotta ball, lil' nigga gotta ball 
 Run up on you, "Where that money at" fuck nigga after that 
 Lean in that double cup, lil' nigga screwed up 
 Pop a pill nigga and he don' feel nigga 
 You do it in the song, he do it for real nigga 
 And all his OG's is either dead or in prison 
 Scared to talk to him like, fuck it, he won't listen 
 Unnecessary shit, thinking that he has to 
 A pair of True Religions dog, my lil nigga blast you 
 Listening to 2 Chainz, ain't thinking 'bout college 
 I wonder if he knew that 2 Chainz went to college 
 I wonder if he knew that, would that change his mind? 
 Guess that's something we'll find in due time
