I was thinking 'bout something, but I ain't worried 'bout nothing 
 Remember when I was struggling, fucked up on my knuckles 
 Tryna sell some dirt weed, taxing off a ten speed 
 Money wasn't coming, for sure nigga I kept fronting 
 I had them dubs on the step (step) 
 I had them dubs on the step (step) 
 I had them dubs on the step (step) 
 I had them dubs on the step (step) 
 Slow days, fast days, getting paper any way 
 Slow days, fast days, getting paper any way 
 Slow days, fast days, getting paper any way 
 Slow days, fast days, getting paper any way 
 And I kept licking on that clit till she gave me that shit 
 I've been fucked up for so long, swear to God I gotta get it 
 I put my back into it, serving bags to them students 
 Tell 'em I got that fire on that porch right there by the Buick 
 I'm just tryna get my mind, go worry nigga 'bout yours 
 Rolling up that Swish, pouring up a four 
 Serving in them hallways, the courtrooms all day 
 Hoods kicked the door down, now we in the Coney 
 I had them dubs on the step (step) 
 I had them dubs on the step (step) 
 I had them dubs on the step (step) 
 I had them dubs on the step (step) 
 Slow days, fast days, getting paper any way 
 Slow days, fast days, getting paper any way 
 Slow days, fast days, getting paper any way 
 Slow days, fast days, getting paper any way 
 It's the same old shit 
 Everybody in the manor is locked up, boxed up 
 It's killing me, niggas wanna get rid of me 
 'Cause I lyrically bust on the riddim, fill the room with humidity 
 Stick it in a manner, the heaviest rhythm banging out 
 Doubling my money getting my hustle in Canning Town 
 Listen up Danny Brown, I been doing this thing 
 Skipped in, then I come and lyrically assist 'em 
 (I had my dubs on the step) 
 I never stopped 'cause I sit in the booth, flipping the truth 
 While you're running and chatting, thinking you're realer than Screw 
 You ain't so why you act, dummy, you think you bad, well that's funny 
 I'm tryna get Maybach money, I'm a Mac Miller, spitting ASAP, rookie 
 I had them dubs on the step (step)
