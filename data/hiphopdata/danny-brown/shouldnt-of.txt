Drunk as fuck, high as shit, bitch suck my dick 
 You ain't never seen a long dick 
 I said a long dick 
 I said a long dick, bitch 
 You gone learn today, you gone learn today 
 Pull it out and spray all on ya lingerie 
 Call it a cum grenade, rub it on yo tummy 
 (Shoulda never gave ya black ass some money!) 
 Now I'm stomping all on yo couches 
 Standing all on yo tables 
 Ripping open yo bitch blouses 
 Got my toungue all up in her navel 
 The baddest mufucka 'round 
 Hold my drink bitch 
 I said bitch I'm Danny Brown 
 Lemme get on my pimp shit 
 I'm sniffing Adderall off yo china 
 Shoes on in yo living room 
 Got my elbows on ya table 
 Left Swisher guts in yo dining room 
 I'm all up in yo kitchen 
 Lips on the orange juice bottle 
 I done popped me an ecstasy pill 
 So you know I'm tryna get higher 
 Shouldn't of gave this nigga nothing 
 Shouldn't of gave my black ass nothing, dog 
 Remember when I was struggling? 
 Caught the bus 'cause I was hustling 
 Used to stack up to go to Hudsons 
 Hid the work from my older cousin 
 Hit my shit like it wasn't nothing 
 Knew I wouldn't fight him so said fuck it 
 My pockets on dummy 
 They say I'm acting funny 
 Shouldn't of never gave my black ass no money 
 Now I'm blowing on the best kush 
 Shit be fucking my lungs up 
 2 packs of Newports a day 
 And I used to just buy loosies tho 
 Hos all on my dick 
 Them hos ain't wanna fuck before 
 But still I fucked them bitches 
 But I just never call no more 
 I'm all up in yo liquor cabinet 
 Drinking whatever up in the bitch 
 Took too many pills 
 Now I'm throwing up in yo toilet 
 I'm like aww shit 
 I'm in the house of hip hop 
 With my motherfuckin feet on the table 
 Ran the phone bill up on the phone sex line 
 And I even ordered porn on the cable 
 Give a nigga from my hood a thousand 
 He'll treat it like a 100 thousand, nigga 
 Public assistance housing 
 Mice all up in yo closet 
 Keeping it G ain't bout where you from 
 It's about where you gone be 
 'Cause ain't shit sweet when you living on the street 
 And there's roaches crawling on your cheek
