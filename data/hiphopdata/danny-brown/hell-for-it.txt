Holy spirit 
 When I look 
 I cannot see 
 Reflection in the mirror 
 Broke bread with the Judas 
 And I think I see it clearer 
 These niggas want what's mine 
 But I be damn if I'm a give up 
 Stuck up in the hood 
 Praying rap would get me out 
 Momma 'bout to lose her house 
 Gotta figure this shit out 
 Use to catch the bus to 12th 
 Just to hustle for some Prada 
 In the kitchen with my uncle 
 Beat the pot like a piñata 
 Baraka wit the product 
 Use to hide it in my closet 
 Type of shit 
 That have a fiend 
 Crawling on his carpet 
 Walking over carcasses 
 Of artists in my garden 
 Nice with the bars 
 Even the beat begs my pardon 
 Got me mistaken 
 Muslim salami bacon 
 Always on the defense 
 So it's no offense taken 
 I'm smoking on them raisins 
 From the bay they taste amazing 
 Cajun kicking flavor 
 All the time 
 Not on occasion 
 Would be amazed 
 All the time I heard I wouldn't make it 
 I was writing shit that was so damn amazing 
 When half these little niggas was still watching 
 That's so raven 
 I was out there hustling 
 Scraping up and saving 
 Just to catch a 12 hour bus to NY 
 Sleeping on the floor in studios 
 Asking God why 
 But never got deterred 
 From the voice I heard inside 
 Tell myself everyday 
 The greatest that's alive 
 And I'm a give 'em hell for it 
 Until it's heaven on earth 
 My nigga 
 I'm a give 'em hell for it 
 For whatever it's worth 
 My nigga 
 I'm a give 'em hell for it 
 Unless death come first 
 My nigga 
 I'm a give 'em hell for it 
 For whatever it's worth 
 My nigga 
 I'm a give 'em hell 
 'Cause we living in that 
 Actavis double cups was addicted to that 
 Had them demons on my back 
 Was escaping through that 
 Blamed everybody but myself 
 Apologies for that 
 So they hold a nigga back 
 For the way that I act 
 People scared of doing business 
 Thinking I smoke crack 
 I react immature 
 To anyone talking smack 
 'Cause where I'm from respect 
 The only thing that you have 
 Grew up virtually poor 
 Realities unmasked 
 So my task 
 Is inspire your future with my past 
 I lived through that shit 
 So you don't have to go through it 
 Stepping stones in my life 
 Hot coals 
 Walk with me 
 Listen when I speak 
 Every time talk with me 
 Couple screws loose 
 You don't wanna start 
 With me 
 Got it from Motown 
 Feel David Ruffin pain 
 Wanna cry right now 
 So I'm wishing that it rain 
 'Cause I'm knowing I'm the best 
 They compare skills to sales 
 Tell myself everyday 
 Know this shit ain't real 
 Radio don't make you ill 
 They get a hit a they feel they self 
 Respect for lyricism 
 In this game ain't none left 
 Have a bitch like Iggy 
 Think she sicker than me 
 And that's so fucked up 
 That's just how this shit be 
 I just wanna make music 
 Fuck being a celebrity 
 'Cause these songs that I write 
 Leave behind my legacy 
 And I'm a give 'em hell for it 
 Until it's heaven on earth 
 My nigga 
 I'm a give 'em hell for it 
 For whatever it's worth 
 My nigga 
 I'm a give 'em hell for it 
 Unless death come first 
 My nigga 
 I'm a give 'em hell for it 
 For whatever it's worth 
 My nigga 
 I'm a give 'em hell 
 I'm a give 'em hell
