You know I'm living like a rolling stone 
 But don't feel for me 
 You know I'm in my zone 
 So don't speak to me 
 And in my mind I just feel so alone 
 Just release me 
 Feeling like I got money 
 Know I'm just nigga rich 
 Even if she fuck me 
 I still know life a bitch 
 Bought a nightmare, sold a dream 
 Happiness went upstream 
 Blame myself, I had no control 
 Now I'm living with no soul 
 I'm on a road that never ends 
 Don't know opposite of sin 
 Some people say I think too much 
 I don't think they think enough 
 Time rough but it got rougher 
 Weight heavier up on my shoulders 
 Living crooked 'til it's over 
 Can't be straight, can't be sober 
 Thought process so immature 
 Can't make it up, up out the sewer 
 Feeling like there's no hope 
 Blaze dope, my mind float 
 I love her, she love me 
 Love ain't enough with no bucks 
 Fucked up, that's the way it is 
 I don't know who I should trust 
 Riding around with the windows up 
 Smoking like it's ten of us 
 Just me in the back seat 
 With the driver bumping them Isleys 
 I'm walking on this long road 
 Will I come back? 
 Homie, I don't even really know 
 You know I'm living like a rolling stone 
 But don't feel for me 
 You know I'm in my zone 
 So don't speak to me 
 And in my mind I just feel so alone 
 Just release me 
 Feeling like I'm not alive 
 But I know I'm not dead 
 Living lies but can't hide 
 Deep inside, the truth dies 
 Bought hope, can't get change 
 Lost my brain, going insane 
 Self-medicate is how I cope 
 Leave my body, soul go afloat 
 On a roll that never ends 
 Don't know where I should begin 
 Feeling trapped, no looking back 
 Head first in that deep end 
 Living like a rolling stone 
 When I die, I leave alone 
 Getting high, I feel low 
 But we all know life goes on 
 You know I'm living like a rolling stone 
 But don't feel for me 
 You know I'm in my zone 
 So don't speak to me 
 And in my mind I just feel so alone 
 Just re- 
 All that I know 
 All that I know is to feel your shame 
 'Cause you can't let go 
 'Cause you can't let go, you drive me insane 
 But will I ever find my way? 
 Or go back to the beginning 
 There's a thing that I know for sure
