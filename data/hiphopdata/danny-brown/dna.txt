It's in my DNA 'cause my pops like to get fucked up the same way 
 It's in my DNA 'cause my moms like to get fucked up the same way 
 DNA, DNA 'cause my fam like to get fucked up the same way 
 DNA, DNA 'cause my fam like to get fucked up the same way 
 Waking up, drooling on Versace pillowcases 
 I ain't smoke an eighth a day, I might end up a mental patient 
 Terry cloth bathrobes, blunts and ashtrays 
 White wine in flute glass, early morning Saturdays 
 Food plates and grape Ape, crepes and OJ 
 Bitches swimming topless in chlorine off morphine 
 Emails on iPads don't answer when phone rings 
 Text message full coming down on four beans 
 Every night like a bachelor party in Sin City 
 Bitches sniffing coke off each other titties with rolled fifties 
 Life I live like Charlie Sheen and Rick James 
 Going hard till it ain't a dollar to my name 
 This that triple X shit nigga, how ya feel? 
 Groupies like glam rock, poison logo pills 
 Sniffing molly off amps blond haired tramps 
 When I'm on my way to the stage every night I rage 
 It's in my DNA 'cause my pops like to get fucked up the same way 
 It's in my DNA 'cause my moms like to get fucked up the same way 
 DNA, DNA 'cause my fam like to get fucked up the same way 
 DNA, DNA 'cause my fam like to get fucked up the same way 
 Warhols all on the wall of the villa 
 Adderall popping got me jumping to ceiling 
 Perceived as a villain no sentiment in my sentence 
 For instance in instants they'll be calling forensics 
 If incidents occur remember these ain't just words 
 Go from talking shit to organs preserved 
 You soft serve rappers just hide behind your reverb 
 And even without effects you'll end up dessert 
 I research and homework, make you dig ya own dirt 
 On beats buried alive, ratting wise guys 
 I'm with a Latin bitch, fat ass, well proportioned thighs 
 And love to see it cumming so I squirt it in her eyes 
 I'm hopping out that new shit like narcs on Tuesday 
 The grill on it shiny like LL Cool J's 
 What's on my waist could make a nigga meet ya doomsday 
 To describe ya mixtape that shit was like a toothache 
 It's in my DNA 'cause my pops like to get fucked up the same way 
 It's in my DNA 'cause my moms like to get fucked up the same way 
 DNA, DNA 'cause my fam like to get fucked up the same way 
 DNA, DNA 'cause my fam like to get fucked up the same way
