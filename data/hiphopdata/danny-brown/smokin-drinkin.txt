Check 
 A-Trak, what up? 
 Drop a deuce in that soda, tell your ho to come over 
 Coming straight out that Motor, sipping oil never sober 
 Bring backwoods of that OG, we smoking 'em back-to-back 
 Molly looking like sugar, so you know that I'm dipping it 
 See my jeans 'bout a stack and my shoes cost 'bout half of that 
 Let's not talk 'bout the shirt, she can't even pronounce that 
 Ghetto nigga in high end, my theory is low end 
 My tribe on a quest, put that money in motion 
 So bitch, we smoking and drink, drinking and smoke 
 My ho got tats on her face, sell me them cookies from Oakland 
 But not the kind that you eat, stuff it in Swisher Sweets 
 And we smoke blunt after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt 
 I don't know what y'all be thinking 
 Spaced-out, rolling up that stinky 
 Big big blunts the size of pinkies 
 Pour one out, we still be leaning 
 I don't know what y'all be thinking 
 Smoking, drinking, drinking, smoking 
 In that order, we slow motion 
 Till it's over, never stop 
 Smoking and drink, drinking and smoke 
 We be smoking and drink, drinking and smoke 
 We be smoking and drink, drinking and smoke 
 We be smoking and drink, drinking and smoke 
 Gotta get away, to escape, I smoke this kush to the face 
 Gotta get away, get away, I think I need to pray 
 Please, oh Lord, oh Lord, I need your help again 
 Took too many pills and I think I hear my heart beating 
 Taking over those chances, honey backwoods stuffed with that grammy 
 My ho blowing that powder, mixing liquor with them Xannies 
 Stress party, get away, hope that these problems just go away 
 Right there in my face, I ignore it every day 
 I be smoking and drink, drinking and smoke 
 We be smoking and drink, drinking and smoke 
 We be smoking and drink, drinking and smoke 
 We be smoking and drink, drinking and smoke 
 I don't know what y'all be thinking 
 Spaced-out, rolling up that stinky 
 Big big blunts the size of pinkies 
 Pour one out, we still be leaning 
 I don't know what y'all be thinking 
 Smoking, drinking, drinking, smoking 
 In that order, we slow motion 
 Till it's over, never stop 
 We be smoking and drink, drinking and smoke 
 We be smoking and drink, drinking and smoke 
 We be smoking and drink, drinking and smoke 
 We be smoking and drink, drinking and smoke
