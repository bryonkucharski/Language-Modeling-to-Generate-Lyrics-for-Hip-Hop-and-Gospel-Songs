Made 30 bands in 30 minutes 
 Before I count it, I done damn near spent it 
 Put a brick on ya in some Rick Owens 
 Flow sick, nigga, call it pneumonia 
 I'm on ya 
 Made 30 bands in 30 minutes 
 Before I count it, I done damn near spent it 
 Put a brick on ya in some Rick Owens 
 Flow sick, nigga, call it pneumonia 
 I'm on ya 
 Old nigga came in this bitch with a new gun 
 Clip looking like a fucking mile long 
 If that shit hits you close range, ya calzone 
 Powder stains on my Balmain 
 Slurp that pussy up just like lo mein 
 If that coke burn my nose, I'ma complain 
 Made 30 bands in 30 minutes 
 Before I count it, I done damn near spent it 
 Put a brick on ya in some Rick Owens 
 Flow sick, nigga, call it pneumonia 
 I'm on ya 
 Made 30 bands in 30 minutes 
 Before I count it, I done damn near spent it 
 Put a brick on ya in some Rick Owens 
 Flow sick, nigga, call it pneumonia 
 I'm on ya 
 I'm smoking dope, I'm smoking dope 
 Got a half a pound of artichoke 
 Scale broke, so we eyeball it 
 Her titties out just like New Orleans 
 Mardi gras, we party hard, she off the soft 
 My dick head, she celebrate like the world end 
 And she could be my girlfriend 
 Only fuck her on the weekend 
 Momma found some racks in some dirty jeans 
 Told her keep the money, take 'em to the cleaners 
 Threesome watched how this dick came between them 
 Licked the clit and she did the Macarena 
 Crib in the forest, deer in my yard 
 '07, I got locked up on a charge 
 Now a nigga got four bank cards 
 Looking like a nigga gotta thank God 
 Going through a bag like I'm snatching purses 
 Half a key of raw inside my fucking verses 
 Like a surgeon with that scalpel, bring that track to life 
 Bounce that ass for that pussy, got a appetite 
 Geeked up, geeked up, pop a pill just like Mike and Ikes 
 Head sent me straight to the moon with a mac tonight 
 Running low on alcohol, nigga gotta make a call 
 Stay afloat, try not to choke 
 Made 30 bands in 30 minutes 
 Before I count it, I done damn near spent it 
 Put a brick on ya in some Rick Owens 
 Flow sick, nigga, call it pneumonia 
 I'm on ya 
 Made 30 bands in 30 minutes 
 Before I count it, I done damn near spent it 
 Put a brick on ya in some Rick Owens 
 Flow sick, nigga, call it pneumonia 
 I'm on ya 
 I'm smoking dope, I'm smoking dope 
 Got a half a pound of artichoke 
 Scale broke, so we eyeball it 
 Her titties out just like New Orleans
