Looking at this crib for about a whole month 
 A family live there, they got put out last month 
 My uncle sniffing blow while I'm rolling up a blunt 
 His homie in the basement smoking crack with my aunt 
 And tonight's that night we 'bout to get right 
 Piled up in a van with a couple flashlights 
 Metal crowbars gon' get us through the door 
 Take everything nigga, fuck the landlord 
 So now we at the place skullys on bareface 
 'Bout to leave this bitch bare and strip the whole place 
 My unc took outside he ripping down the gutters 
 So we inside tearing up this mothafucka 
 Bust open the walls just to get the wiring 
 Took the hot water tank and leftover appliances 
 Aluminum siding and had to come back 
 'Cause the furnace so big, it wouldn't fit in the back 
 Now it's copper by the pound, wire by the inch 
 Got a check on the first and it's gone by the fifth 
 Scrap or die, nigga 
 And you might be laughing at it 'cause you know the shit is true 
 Rusty flat bed truck the color of doo-doo 
 Scrap or die, nigga 
 Early morning next day at the junkyard 
 Got four loads 'bout to get broke off 
 But these niggas slick man, I swear I'm going off 
 Put the work on the scale and I swear that bitch was off 
 'Cause I know we had way more than that 
 But fuck it, split it up ay I get more than that 
 These niggas always slick on that bullshit 
 Cheat you out a couple bucks on some dope fiend shit 
 So we back in the hood, plot the next lick 
 Got a school closed down and I think we should hit it 
 Just waiting on my unc to get back from the clinic 
 And we gone go over there to see what's up with it 
 Now we up in it taking old computers 
 Until we fucking heard, "Don't move or I shoot ya" 
 Fucked up the hook caught us tryna cash in 
 Now we gotta B&E case of trespassing 
 Now it's copper by the pound, wire by the inch 
 Got a check on the first and it's gone by the fifth 
 Scrap or die, nigga 
 And you might be laughing at it 'cause you know the shit is true 
 Rusty flat bed truck the color of doo-doo 
 Scrap or die, nigga
