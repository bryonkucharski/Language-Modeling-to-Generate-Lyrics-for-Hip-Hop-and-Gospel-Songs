8 balls wit a safety pin 
 I deserve the finer things 
 Told myself back then 
 When I used to ride a Schwinn 
 Now I'm on a tour bus 
 Going places I ain't never been 
 Wrote my rhymes down on a paper bag 
 That was way back 
 Having dreams of a Cadillac 
 Dog, I had to bounce back 
 Locked a nigga up 
 Why they do me like that? 
 Now I'm on the Jack in the county 
 Asking mommy for some money 
 Swear to God she'd do anything for me 
 Now we out the hood and the nightmare is us going back 
 So I won't go to sleep till I finish that 
 Cousin of death anyway 
 Now I see better day 
 And I ain't tryna miss a minute, second hour 
 Living on borrowed time 
 Can't think about tomorrow 
 'Cause it's about today 
 And you know you wanna take my place 
 Let's get it 
 You turn around, and now I'm winning 
 I built it up, from the ground 
 You stay asleep, I'm gonna get it 
 I built it up, from the ground 
 Now tell me, would you sacrifice your dreams? 
 What it takes if you want anything 
 Got me missing sleep 'cause my mind on the beat 
 So while I'm counting bars y'all be counting sheep 
 No cheat sheet, get it out the mud 
 Get it how you live, why I'm out here in the field 
 My nigga wake up, wipe the cold out your eyes 
 It's a cold, cold world but even hotter when you die 
 So no try to do, what about you? 
 Work off, well met, do the same thing too 
 A lot locked up wishing they was like you 
 Got a letter from my nigga saying he be out in June 
 Been down for a minute and every since sentence 
 Things ain't been the same so I'm missing my nigga 
 Staring at the ceiling thinking how far I came 
 Was trapped in the storm but I made it out the rain 
 You turn around, and now I'm winning 
 I built it up, from the ground 
 You stay asleep, I'm gonna get it 
 I built it up, from the ground
