Brown bless the mic like gesundheit 
 Bud 'bout the size of a bonsai 
 Kick it like Muay Thai, flow like sci-fi in high def 
 I'm righteous and still bust a nut up on a bitch chest 
 The verbal folklore been explored 
 And employed by none other than them fools with the gold 
 And them bankrolls explode 
 And your bitch is my target when I shoot my load 
 Bullseye, my eyes tie-dyed 
 Fried off the same shit that rock stars died from 
 Smoke something with your man bitch 
 Like Wyclef used to sell the cannabis 
 Manuscript sick shit, prescription addiction 
 Sniffing adderall off the counter in my kitchen 
 Tripping off the shit that had Brian Wilson flipping 
 Experiment so much it's a miracle I'm living 
 And I'mma die like a rockstar, die like a rockstar 
 I'mma die like a rockstar, die like a rockstar 
 I'mma die like a rockstar, die like a rockstar 
 I'mma die like a rockstar 
 Bitch I wanna party like Chris Farley 
 Shot of Hennessy spike that with some molly 
 Tell mommy I'm sorry, God bless my soul 
 But life is so sublime going out like Brad Nowell 
 I got that Kurt Cobain type of mind-frame 
 Feeling like Keith Moon shrooms in my dressing room 
 Basquiat freestyle 
 Feeling like Jimi Hendrix in Anna-Nicole's mouth 
 River Phoenix '93 VIP 
 With some drugged up porn hoes all around me 
 Like Teri Diver, Linda Wong 
 All in hell having orgies where the horns grow long 
 'Cause bitch I'm Frankie Lymon, Heath Ledger 
 Hyped up in a jacuzzi doing that John Belushi 
 With Brittany Murphy, we blowing hershey 
 I'mma die like a rockstar
