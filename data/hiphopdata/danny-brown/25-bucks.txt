25 bucks, mama braid your hair 
 Sit on the porch, she'll do it on the stairs 
 Grew your hair out and you wanna get it twisted 
 Fed us many nights, nigga, that's how we was living 
 25 bucks, mama braid your hair 
 Sit on the porch, she'll do it on the stairs 
 Grew your hair out and you wanna get it twisted 
 Fed us many nights, nigga, that's how we was living 
 I'll not get old 
 If I dig with my knees, if I grind down my teeth 
 I know from the attic of me 
 From the bottoms of pleas, from the waywarded seas 
 Arthritis in her fingers, carpal tunnel in her wrists 
 'Bout to feed her kids at night sit between her legs and twist 
 While she listen to the oldie soap operas smoking bogies 
 On the phone gossiping telling homegirls stories 
 Girlfriend worried cause her son's in a hurry 
 To see the state pen' or a cemetery buried 
 Ma replied do her best but it's still rough 
 Keep your kids off the street and away from drugs 
 Doing hair in the house ain't putting on Daniel 
 Daddy in and out, ay, who turned that channel? 
 Sneakers turn to house shoes, stepping on the back 
 Ashing her cigarette in a brown paper bag 
 Smoking joints, lauging tryna get the part straight 
 For ten, put your perm in, don't scratch all day 
 Hot cocoa stove, put the food in the bowl 
 Say that's how many nights it was hard to keep going 
 Now I'm trapped in the trap and the devil ain't forgetting 
 Wanna see me dead or locked in a prison 
 In the system with division only thing that add up 
 Fucked up, 'cause a nigga tryna get a couple bucks 
 Now I'm trapped in the trap and the devil ain't forgetting 
 Wanna see me dead or locked in a prison 
 In the system with division only thing that add up 
 Fucked up, 'cause a nigga tryna get a couple bucks

 If I dig with my knees, if I grind down my teeth 
 I know from the attic of me 
 From the bottoms of pleas, from the waywarded seas 
 Iverson zig zags, good night fast food 
 If you really balling, mommy cop Chinese food 
 If you really wonder why these people got issues 
 'Cause the rent owed and the fucking lights due 
 On her knees at night, pray a miracle come through 
 Daddy shooting Craps, tryna win a pair of shoes 
 I been growing my hair 'bout to let mommy twist it 
 Out wilding with my friends, even got myself a biscuit 
 Homie mama smoking with nothing to lose 
 Now he stashing cracks in some hundred dollar shoes 
 Sitting at his crib, smoking Swishers, getting faded 
 Told me hit my mommy up, 'cause he tryna get braided 
 What we gon' do see the local dope man 
 See if he can put some money in our hand 
 Same one jump me, the same one front me 
 'Cause I'm tired of seeing my family fucked up and hungry 
 Now I'm in the trap and the devil ain't forgetting 
 Wanna see a nigga dead or locked in a prison 
 In the system with division only thing that add up 
 Fucked up, nigga tryna get a couple bucks
