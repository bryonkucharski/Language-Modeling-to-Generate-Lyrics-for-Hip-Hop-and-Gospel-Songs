Kush got a nigga feeling awesome 
 Ate that bitch pussy 'til she squirted like a dolphin 
 Told her bend over, hit that shit doggy 
 Called her a cab then I told that bitch to call me 
 Danny Brown bitch, tell me what you need 
 I got some Adderall and fire ass weed 
 And they try to tell me I get too high 
 That's a lie, if so, bitch, I woulda been died 
 But the flow OD, don't get cochesed, capiche? 
 Fuck with me, fuck around and be deceased 
 Rest in peace wack niggas with your oversized clothes 
 Complain about my jeans 'cause I'm taking all they hoes 
 Hold up, wait a minute 
 Your pussy ain't shit till you had some Danny in it 
 I'm gone off a Xanny nodding off watching menace 
 Rolling on some purple that my nigga call Grimace 
 Bitch I ain't finish 
 These bars was test tubed in the lab with foreign chemist 
 Rolling testers on it but statistics got slumped 
 I'm smoking blunt after blunt 
 And I smoke 
 Blunt after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt 
 And I smoke 
 Blunt after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt 
 And I smoke 
 Blunt after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt 
 And I smoke 
 Blunt after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt (Stop) 
 Till my brain feels ten pounds heavier 
 You fell off like Tom Selleck in a Celica 
 Bitch give me brain for the hell of it 
 But to her it's heaven if she even gets a smell of it 
 That's why these bitches fuck with me 
 'Cause I eat that pussy like a female MC 
 You get it? How about me and your girlfriend, you with it? 
 Money over everything the only thing that matter 
 And since I been getting it my been blunts getting fatter 
 Take a couple puffs off it now a nigga woozy 
 The white hoes I fuck with consider them whooties 
 We 'bout to make a movie, starring me and a cast full of groupies 
 And I do my own stunts, I'm smoking blunt after blunt 
 And I smoke 
 Blunt after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt 
 And I smoke 
 Blunt after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt 
 And I smoke 
 Blunt after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt 
 And I smoke 
 Blunt after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt (Stop)
