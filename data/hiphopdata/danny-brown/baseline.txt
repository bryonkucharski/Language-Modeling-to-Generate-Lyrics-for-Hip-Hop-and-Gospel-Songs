Ho, the only thing you gotta know 
 My dick touch the ground when I'm sittin' on the floor 
 You think I'm gon' fall off? 
 I got advice for ya holmes 
 Fall asleep in your car 
 In your garage with the engine on 
 I'm playing ping pong with your bitch jaw 
 You the type to have a sing-a-long in Superman drawls 
 I got the redhead ho 
 I call her Molly Ringwald 
 She like to take a lot of Molly 
 And bring Adderall 
 Sipping white wine till the sunset 
 Before it got dark she already got naked 
 Necked her for a second 
 Then she got reckless 
 Rump shaker, wrecks and FX'd it 
 Bum stickity bum stickity bum Das EFX Shit 
 Left her bum sticky 
 Fell asleep on the terrace 
 Me on the beat, that's a hate crime 
 With black ink, I murder white lines 
 Baseline 
 What's with all the ho shit? 
 Your flow's atrocious 
 The amount of weed I smoke is copious 
 Eyes red like Soviet 
 Dog, you're on some bogus shit 
 These novice poets are not my associates 
 Ferocious; but the flows inappropriate 
 But if you approach this they might call encroachment 
 I'm so bent, oh shit 
 Got your bitch soakin' 
 I ain't Clarence Carter 
 But bitch I be Strokin' 
 Ho, are you outta your mind? 
 I tell a bitch like this, 
 "You are not that fine" 
 I don't give a bitch shit 
 No, not a dime 
 But bitch, for you, 
 I ain't even got time 
 The sunshine in the thunder storm 
 Catching clouds smelling like the green giant underarm 
 I can never cop her holmes 
 I just give her Sutter Homes 
 Nut all on her butt 
 Wipe it up, then I send her home
