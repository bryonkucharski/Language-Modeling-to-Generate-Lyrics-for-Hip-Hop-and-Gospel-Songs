Thirty 
 Tut 
 Colder than them grits they fed slaves 
 Me to rap is like water to raves 
 AK's with bayonets on deck, rep my set 
 Sorta like Squidward and his clarinet 
 I'm in ya bitch mouth but she fantasizing 
 Staring at the skinnys said it's so tantalizing 
 Dog I'm strategizing, plotting on throne 
 The master of the ace sitting on chrome 
 Dark nights tryna sleep stomach on fire 
 Delusional from hunger so I couldn't get tired 
 Imagining the equalizer goin' from green to red 
 Words that rhyme together just appear all in my head 
 And I'm sorta like Neo with the Matrix code 
 I try to escape it hoping drugs a numb a soul 
 Say I'm getting old and times running out 
 Repeating instrumentals tryna figure patterns out 
 I never leave the house ain't slept in three days 
 Popping pills, writing, drinking and smoking haze 
 Weaving kicks and snares, tryna dodge these hooks 
 Keepin' it original something that's overlooked 
 The way a nigga going might go out like Sam Cooke 
 Or locked up calling home for money on my books 
 'Cause if this shit don't work, nigga I failed at life 
 Turning to these drugs, now these drugs turned my life 
 And it's the downward spiral, got me suicidal 
 But too scared to do it so these pills will be the rifle 
 Surpassing all my idols, took the wrong turn 
 But can't go back now so now let that blunt burn 
 'Cause now it's my turn if I fuck it all up 
 It took a while to get here now I depend on these drugs, I 
 I took a while to get here now I depend on these drugs
