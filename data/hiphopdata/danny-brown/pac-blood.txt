The Shakespeare of sixteens, dipping my ink pen 
 Made a sculpture of me but my dick was too thin 
 Paint pictures of me but they never get my chin 
 One writing scriptures bringing tears to the princess 
 Every time I indent, you can see the intent 
 Leave your mind bent, hanging on the every sentence 
 Have no apprentice, style uninherited 
 Laughing at you peasants 'cause my penmanship is excellence 
 Whenever in the presence, eyes get wide 
 I'm the town hero 'cause my words give them pride 
 And what they feel inside, I say the perfect words for 'em 
 Some say I'm a prophet with the visions I get cursed for 
 Leave them all astonished, ride with the verbs 
 Make a grown man cry with strength of the words 
 Tears to Mona Lisa, Medusa to liquid 
 Flow can make Gandhi grab the burner, wanna shoot shit 
 Rhymes that make the Pope wanna get his dick sucked 
 Had Virgin Mary doing lines in the pick-up 
 Make Sarah Palin deep-throat till she hiccup 
 Had T.D. Jakes round this bitch doing stick-ups 
 Rhymes so real, thought I wrote it in Pac blood 
 Told me in my dreams that these niggas is not thugs 
 Tut 
 What's in the portfolio? Sicker than polio 
 Shit so personal, my mom can't listen to 
 Oh so original, nigga's extra-crispy 
 Bars so Bukowski, Soda Popinski 
 Little Macs could never be number one, your time's done 
 Bomb filling smelling like napalm, your day's gone 
 Langston Hughes with a blew fuse and a screw loose 
 Maya Angelou abused child with her notebook 
 Spitting like Kipling with a tooth missing 
 Tongue bring torture to men, women and children 
 Memoir's sacred, hid in the basement 
 Await my next piece at a formal engagement 
 Crowds walk for miles just to hear that sound 
 Start to get more power than the ones that wear crowns 
 Tears to Mona Lisa, Medusa to liquid 
 Flow can make Gandhi grab the burner, wanna shoot shit 
 Rhymes that make the Pope wanna get his dick sucked 
 Had Virgin Mary doing lines in the pick-up 
 Make Sarah Palin deep-throat till she hiccup 
 Had T.D. Jakes round this bitch doing stick-ups 
 Rhymes so real, thought I wrote it in Pac blood 
 Told me in my dreams that these niggas is not thugs
