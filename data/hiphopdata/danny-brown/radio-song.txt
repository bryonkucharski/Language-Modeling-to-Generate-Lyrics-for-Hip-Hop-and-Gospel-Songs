This is anti-clean rap, nigga, where the green at? 
 Risks I take you'd swear I had the balls the size of bean bags 
 Not what you're used to, bitch I rep the Bruiser 
 And the label Fool's Gold, jeans with medusas 
 Bitches wanna scoop us, get pussy like loofahs 
 Y'all niggas losers cop clothes from the boosters 
 Hoes wanna choose up, of course they gon' choose us 
 So though you need a stylist, also you need a tutor 
 These stupid-ass niggas wouldn't know what to do 
 So they copy wack niggas, that's what they makes you 
 The game's so trendy, that's why these labels fails 
 'Cause they don't care about music, just first week sales 
 So they say you need a hit, a chart toppin' single 
 That's why it's called commercial because you need a jingle 
 A smash crowd banger, play it all night long 
 You never get on without a radio song 
 So this my radio song 
 This my radio song 
 She wanna ride the wave, watch me do my swag surf 
 Party like a rockstar, never bought a makeup purse 
 Songs with no feelings, but she feel my thang on her 
 Stripper with a leaky ceiling, I'mma make it rain on her 
 Taught me how to Dougie, I'd rather see you jerk 
 Until it skeet skeet on the walls and her shirt 
 She'd rather hear a love song about what she getting 
 But not from Danny Brown, cause bitch I ain't tricking 
 Do the pretty girl rock, and even though you're ugly 
 Getting dirty money, but bitch I ain't Puffy 
 Ice cream paint job, semi with a hemi 
 Heavy duty Chevy, not a Beamer, Benz or Bentley 
 There's no originality, carbon copy singles 
 He made "Black and Yellow"? I'mma make "Black and Emo" 
 That's why these wack rappers, they never last long 
 Don't care about music, just radio songs 
 So they say you need a hit, a chart toppin' single 
 That's why it's called commercial because you need a jingle 
 A smash crowd banger, play it all night long 
 You never get on, without a radio song 
 So this my radio song 
 This my radio song
