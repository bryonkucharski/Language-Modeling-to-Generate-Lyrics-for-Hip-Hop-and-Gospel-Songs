And every time she say it I keep thinking Indos 
 So now I'm thinking chicken with a UK pasho 
 Just a hood nigga with a different type of taste, man 
 But she fuck with me 'cause she know I ain't a waste, man 
 Rap Frank Zappa, stepping on it like a capo 
 Even at your pastor, say I got the Master Blaster 
 Purple like a Raptor jersey, Hershey and the Swisher Sweet 
 Pistol speak, if you don't listen nigga that ass'll leak 
 Master beef, Green Beret your style flow, casualty 
 Drastically, streets is saying that hip hop needed me 
 I'm the majesty so greet me as your highness 
 Sipping on the Heineken while blowing on the finest 
 Minusing your pocket while I'm clearing up your sinus 
 Hoes use vaginas try to set us up and line us 
 My nigga roll the chronic 
 Smoking on some thunder from the land of supersonic 
 One puff can make you vomit, but I can face a whole one 
 Call my nigga up when I'm broke, let me hold one 
 And I'm owed one, like to pop another 
 But I ain't feeling yet dawg, so let me pop another 
 Danny Brown the Hybrid, pilot violet to the white kids 
 I'm psychic, knew these bitches suck my dick and she did 
 I'm violent, fist go in your mouth like trident 
 She tried it, hit me up and came back for seconds 
 I wrecked it, rappers soft and have no progression 
 Correction, killing shit nigga, adolescence 
 Connection, y'all niggas begging 
 Testing at the dinner, turn your ass to breakfast 
 Intersection like some bitch undressing 
 Dick hurt from texting 
 Slurping on the exit 
 Gave a pearl necklace 
 Now where the next bitch, they all want to text this 
 And hope I'm sexing this 
 The right message, because I'm on some next shit 
 Caress this, put they mouth on it, put their neck in it 
 Desperate, spray up in their hair like nexus 
 Question, anybody know where the ex is? (where the ex at?)
