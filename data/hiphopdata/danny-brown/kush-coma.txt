Close my eyes, feel like I'm going down 
 In an elevator at 90 miles an hour 
 And all I see is stars and they coming at me 
 Sort of like a meteor shower 
 My forehead's sweaty, my eyelids heavy 
 Feeling like I ain't going make it 
 'Cause inside my head's like a firework show 
 In the 4th July in Las Vegas 
 Said, I'm tripping, I'm slipping 
 Feeling like I just can't move 
 And I done took me a couple more pills 
 Next thing I know, I'm taking off my shoes 
 And I'm on walking on these clouds like marshmallows 
 Nodding off, smelling like rose petals 
 Zoning out, two-three, like the fiend 
 In hell fire and angel wings 
 I'm conscious to that world, connin' science 'bout that world 
 All these drugs up in me, it's a miracle I ain't mirror Kurt 
 I'm numb like a mortician, going dumb with Oakland bitches 
 They say you hella bootsie, roll a backwood up with them cookies 
 I'm smoking, back to back, back to back, back to back 
 It's the blunt after blunt rotation 
 Now I'm in a kush coma off the OG aroma 
 And my brain going on vacation 
 I'm smoking, back to back, back to back, back to back 
 It's the blunt after blunt rotation 
 Now I'm in a kush coma off the OG aroma 
 And my brain going on vacation 
 Kush coma, I am in a kush coma 
 Kush coma, I am in a kush coma 
 Kush coma, I am in a kush coma 
 Kush coma, I am in a kush coma 
 Kush coma, I am in a kush coma 
 Kush coma, I am in a kush coma 
 Kush coma, I am in a kush coma 
 Kush coma, I am in a kush coma 
 Get high, my niggas, smoke kush 
 Get fly, my niggas, dope looks 
 So many numbers in my phone book 
 I could start a mothafuckin' phone book 
 Know all the fly bitches gonna look 
 Like I'm on something, tell 'em roll something 
 I'm that one nigga, bumping 2Pac 
 Be like three hoes, that's a foursome 
 Fuck niggas always want to hold something 
 Young hot nigga done froze on 'em 
 Went cold on 'em, beat the golds on 'em 
 And clothes on 'em, see the hoes on 'em? 
 Only fear God, never sold on Him 
 Man, I swear to God, put my soul on Him 
 Life's a bitch, but she chose on him 
 Should've died in Hell, but I rose on 'em 
 In big shades, fuck the hypocrites, stop 
 Time let the tats, for the tick, tock 
 Clocks on the wall, fuck your wristwatch 
 Pause, let it stop, hope we get by 
 Bye when I zoom, let it vroom 
 'Bout a hundred goons with a fume, better let it fuse 
 A hundred miles an hour on the booth, better let it loose 
 A hundred by the sour, molly, flower, and they love the shrooms 
 That's real rap, I'm stating facts 
 Contradictions, can't take it back 
 Mommy's stripping, make it clap 
 In a kush coma, finna take a nap (I'm out) 
 Kush coma, I am in a kush coma 
 Kush coma, I am in a kush coma 
 Kush coma, I am in a kush coma 
 Kush coma, I am in a kush coma 
 Kush coma, I am in a kush coma 
 Kush coma, I am in a kush coma 
 Kush coma, I am in a kush coma 
 Kush coma, I am in a kush coma 
 Half asleep with that cotton mouth, weed grow house on plantation 
 Nuggets the size of Rakim rings, got my head looking like a fatality screen 
 Got my mind dripping, gotta get away from all this bullshit in my way 
 Knowing goddamn well when the high go away 
 Same shit gon' be still in my way 
 I'm a slave to the sticky icky 
 So nigga roll something with me 
 Been smoking blunts since high school 
 Now look at all the bullshit I been through 
 Wanna pass out, but we stayin up 
 Nigga gotta keep one eye open 
 'Cause nigga ain't tryna miss the next turn 
 Nigga roll up, then we starting smoking 
 I'm smoking on that ocho, got my mind on that cosmos 
 Sipping on that purple, got a nigga in slo-mo 
 Dipping in that molly, feel like I'm doing 100 on a Harley 
 Tell your baby mama sorry, that was one night and please don't call me 
 I'm smoking, back to back, back to back, back to back 
 It's the blunt after blunt rotation 
 Now I'm in a kush coma off the OG aroma 
 And my brain going on vacation 
 I'm smoking, back to back, back to back, back to back 
 It's the blunt after blunt rotation 
 Now I'm in a kush coma off the OG aroma 
 And my brain going on vacation 
 Kush coma, I am in a kush coma 
 Kush coma, I am in a kush coma 
 Kush coma, I am in a kush coma 
 Kush coma, I am in a kush coma 
 Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
