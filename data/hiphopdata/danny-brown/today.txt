Watch who you 'round 
 Gotta watch they mouth 
 When them guns come out 
 And them shots ring out 
 You know what they about 
 Watch what they say 
 Watch what they do 
 When a hook come around 
 Them kids come down 
 They a tell on you 
 It's snakes in the grass 
 Getting trapped by rodents 
 Potent we smoking 
 A leave you choking 
 Hoping you focused 
 So dog take notice 
 For a flash of light 
 Run you off light roaches 
 Hopping off porches 
 With chrome 44 
 Nose long as song 
 Made by Mike Bolton 
 Lightning bolts 
 Rip through your torso 
 Raining blood 
 After that thunder 
 Mommas crying 
 Children wonder 
 But this is the life 
 That we all succumbed to 
 Make a nigga wanna go 
 And cut his phone off 
 Cops killing niggas everyday 
 Like protocol 
 Watch the TV 
 Turn on the news 
 Make a nigga feel like 
 He listened to blues 
 In the hood 
 Wit that Arm and Hammer 
 Getting them Pampers 
 For baby mama 
 Hood flick us 
 We in the slammer 
 Now ya baby raised 
 By another man bruh 
 Cure for cancer 
 Cure for A.I.D.S 
 Make a nigga 
 Wanna stay on tour for days 
 Everywhere you go 
 Gotta keep that tool 
 'Cause you don't want end up 
 Happening to you 
 So everywhere you go 
 Gotta keep that tool 
 'Cause you don't want it end up 
 Happening to you 
 Today today today 
 I say you never never never know 
 When ya time to go 
 I say you never never never know 
 When ya time to go 
 So damn right I cheated 
 Today today today 
 I say you never never never know 
 When ya time to go 
 I say you never never never know 
 When ya time to go 
 So damn right I cheated

 Gotta watch these niggas 
 Better watch these niggas 
 'Cause for a little bit of crumbs 
 When you trapped in the slums 
 They a pop you nigga 
 Watch where you go 
 Watch where you at 
 'Cause goons on attack 
 And that's a fact 
 You don't want it like that 
 Niggas get bodied like everyday 
 Nigga masked up like masquerade 
 Bruiser Brigade 
 Nigga take this fade 
 Or get marked out 
 Like crossword game 
 For a little name 
 Nigga pop yo chain 
 Playing no games 
 Evict arcade 
 Trade in your life 
 For a pair of new J's 
 A-OK with them AK's 
 Broad daylight 
 Make you do a relay 
 Duck behind cars 
 When you hear the tool spray 
 You don't want beef 
 Get simmer soufflé 
 Sitting in the Bimmer 
 With ya lightskin bae 
 Fuck all the tough shit 
 I'm tryna get paid 
 You ain't bout money 
 Nigga you the same way 
 End of the day 
 Nigga jail the new slave 
 Trust my nigga 
 You don't wanna go that way 
 Today today today 
 I say you never never never know 
 When ya time to go 
 I say you never never never know 
 When ya time to go 
 So damn right I cheated 
 Today today today 
 I say you never never never know 
 When ya time to go 
 I say you never never never know 
 When ya time to go 
 So damn right I cheated 
 Today today today

 When ya time to go 
 I say you never never never know 
 When ya time to go 
 So damn right I did it
