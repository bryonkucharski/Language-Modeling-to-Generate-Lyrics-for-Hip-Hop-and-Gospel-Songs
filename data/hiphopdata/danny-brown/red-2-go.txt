Codeine in my cereal 
 Always behind a smokey, I'm sorta like a miracle 
 You rappers are venereal and never in my stereo 
 Might spray your ass with vinegar, the next time that I see ya bro 
 Bet your ass still won't be tight 
 The size of my dick, nigga, every pussy tight 
 I write all night till the sun comes up 
 Dodging texts from your sister tryna lick on my nuts 
 Cobra clutch the game, put that bitch into submission 
 Your bitch want the stick shift, no transmission 
 Dawg, I'm on a mission, you're playing exhibition 
 On an expedition, popping X but never tripping 
 Chilling with a vixen, tryna stick my dick in 
 Red head ho, like a young Kathy Griffin 
 Smoked so many blunts, I can hear my lungs whistling 
 Still rolling up, ho smelling like chicken 
 Rap Martin Lawrence, all you other rappers boring 
 Bruiser make 2 Live Crew look like some mormons 
 Nigga my essay is hard like a life-doing ese 
 Gang-banging on the yard with a home made machete 
 Been nice since cassette tapes, stay smoking heavy 
 Popped a couple pills, eye's glowing like Belly 
 Used to stash the cracks in the seams of my Pelle 
 Detroit nigga, but I'm smoking on LA 
 And is anybody nervous? 
 I'm red' to go, I said I'm red' to go 
 I said is anybody worried? 
 I'm red' to go, I said I'm red' to go 
 I said is anybody scared? 
 I'm red' to go, I said I'm red' to go 
 Well, I used to be afraid 
 I'm red' to go, I said I'm red' to go 
 Tired of where I came from but know where I'm going 
 Tears in my eyes, 'cause I'm smoking on an onion 
 Aroma on that 'etra, scary and McNairy 
 Off of moon rocks in Barcelona popping cherries 
 Blow jobs from model twins, doing drugs with acronyms 
 So many lines, thought this shit was Busch Gardens 
 Party starting monster with the hair like Blanka 
 Hotel room like a hair metal concert 
 This blonde made the dick do the spray outta Contra 
 You disrespect I hit you with the slap of Tatanka 
 For dinner nigga used to eat shit that didn't match 
 Like cornbeef hash and some fucking Apple Jacks 
 Used to bag up the packs and eat Coney every night 
 Bologna all night, traps with no peanut butter 
 Couldn't waste it on the mic, so I waste every night 
 Everything came with rice and I knew I wasn't right 
 So I got my ass up, fuck depending on luck 
 Greyhound to NY 'bout 300 bucks 
 Kept my hopes up but my confidence was low 
 Now my self esteem is astral looking at this cash flow 
 Did it my way, I ain't nobody ho 
 I'm 'bout to pimp the rap game, bitch, I'm red' to go 
 I did it my way, I ain't nobody ho 
 I'm 'bout to pimp the rap game, bitch, I'm red' to go 
 And is anybody nervous? 
 I'm red' to go, I said I'm red' to go 
 I said is anybody worried? 
 I'm red' to go, I said I'm red' to go 
 Is anybody scared? 
 I'm red' to go, I said I'm red' to go 
 Well, I used to be afraid 
 I'm red' to go, I said I'm red' to go
