Smoke so much I faint 
 Drink so much 
 You'll think I'll make you walk the plank 
 Bitch you know my rank 
 I'm high 
 Oh my 
 Your bitch is in the telly 
 Getting in them thighs 
 Roll 'em back to back 
 When that's over we gon cop another sack 
 Put some wax on that 
 I'm smacked 
 Cool that 
 Who that 
 Hitting my phone tryna get this dick tonight 
 Now we on the road 
 When them bruisers out 
 You better hide your hoes 
 You know how it goes 
 She chose 
 We roll 
 Uh oh 
 She in the room taking off her clothes 
 But I don't love you hoes 
 No way will I ever give a hoe some dough 
 Never never no 
 No way 
 Un uh 
 No way 
 No way will I ever save a hoe 
 Lines and lines of coke 
 Heart beating hope it ain't my time to go 
 Take another snort 
 No way no no 
 No way 
 No way 
 No way 
 No no 
 Lines and lines of coke 
 Heart beating hope it ain't my time to go 
 Take another snort 
 No way no no 
 No way 
 No way 
 No way 
 No no 
 Now we getting blowed 
 Let go the wheel of what we call self control 
 Popped another roll 
 I'm tore fa sho 
 Oh no 
 I feel a little tingle in my toes 
 Now I'm on the prowl 
 When I'm off that molly I can't turn it down 
 How about you 
 And you and you and you 
 I'm tryna eat all y'all pussy 
 Ya wanna have some fun 
 I ain't never met a hoe I can't make cum 
 Put my tag on that 
 Get that 
 Split that 
 Hit that 
 And now this bitch sucking on my 
 Lines and lines of coke 
 Nose bleeding got me with an itchy throat 
 Heart beating fast 
 Oh no 
 Oh no 
 Oh no 
 I hope it ain't 'bout my time to go
