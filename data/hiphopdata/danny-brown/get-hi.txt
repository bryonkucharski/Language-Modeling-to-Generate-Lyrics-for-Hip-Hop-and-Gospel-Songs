I'm blowing on some Miles 
 Something Kinda Blue 
 The kinda dope 
 You swear could make 
 Dreams come true 
 Sticky icky nugs 
 Real furry buzz 
 This my party pack 
 Call it the cotton club 
 Towel under the door 
 Hotboxing hotels 
 Security knocking 
 What's that smell 
 Ornette with a fortress 
 Scorching frontos on porches 
 Torching up the purple 
 Got me spinning in a circle 
 I'm Coltrane on Soul Plane 
 Propane flow game 
 Bitches know my name from 
 Cancun to Spokane 
 Got it in my carry on 
 Smoke it till it's all gone 
 No homo but yo bitch go 
 Tommy Dorsey on my trombone 
 Hit the greenery jaws go Gillespie 
 Have a nigga shaking like he got epilepsy 
 I hit it twice then I pass it to the right 
 Mary Jane ya be the love of my life 
 Say ya had a bad day 
 Want the stress to go away 
 Just rollup 
 Take the pain away 
 And get hi 
 Stop talking all that jazz 
 Every morning I wake up 
 First thing I roll up 
 Before I get the day started 
 First I gotta bake up 
 And get hi 
 Ya girl just left you 
 You just got fired 
 Ya car acting up 
 You need new tires 
 Your bills all late 
 Anyday ya phone off 
 Fuck it cop a 8th 
 Take the load off 
 Baby Momma tripping 
 Taking you to the court 
 They wanna lock you up 
 But your daughter got new Jordans 
 Yo landlord knocking 
 Her girl cock blocking 
 Dealing with this bullshit 
 Smoke up on the constant 
 Living in this world 
 Always on the edge 
 So to clear yo mind 
 Smoke one to the head 
 Pockets on e 
 Due on ya lease 
 Tryna chop you down 
 So roll up the trees 
 Problem of today 
 Smoke it to the face 
 It's only for a moment 
 But the troubles go away 
 Problems of today 
 Smoke it to the face 
 It's only for a moment 
 But the problems go away 
 Say ya had a bad day 
 Want the stress to go away 
 Just roll up 
 And take the pain away 
 And get hi 
 Every morning I wake up 
 First thing I roll up 
 Before I get the day started 
 First I gotta bake up 
 And get hi
