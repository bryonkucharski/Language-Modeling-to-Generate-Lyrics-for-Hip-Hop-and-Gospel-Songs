31 years old so I done been through all that dizzirt 
 Came up off the porch, straight serving off the cizzurb 
 Long time ago, I don't do that shit no more 
 This the last time I'mma tell you, wanna hear it? (Here it goes) 
 It was me and Baby James, with an ounce to our name 
 Rolling up two at a time, same clothes from yesterday 
 Had a smoke around a custo, paid his ass a stone 
 When the narcs came and raided hid on the roof and smoked bong 
 Fuck with rat bitches, head from them hunnies 
 Lost a sack but I got back, cause the dice game was hitting 
 It was me and Carbo, breaking day in the lobby 
 Nigga popping NoDoz, selling rocks as a hobby 
 Bankroll in my pocket, so everybody know me 
 Went home and gave my mama three hundred for some groceries 
 We hit the mall and ball, hit the club and spend it all 
 Now I'm back to Square A with them squares to get off 
 Dope Song, dopes song, dopes song (my last) 
 Dope Song, dopes song, dopes song (my last) 
 Dope Song, dopes song, dopes song (my last) 
 Dope Song, dopes song, dopes song (my last) 
 Crackhead Lisa, she used to be thick 
 Had sex with a trick and now she sick 
 She offer you some head, if you give her some drugs 
 Just make sure you when you hit it (you better wear a glove) 
 I'm sick of all these niggas with their ten year old stories 
 You ain't doing that no more, nigga lying to the shorty 
 So take this as a diss song, 'cause this is my last song 
 Not my last dope song, but my last dope song 
 Dope Song, dopes song, dopes song (my last) 
 Dope Song, dopes song, dopes song (my last) 
 Dope Song, dopes song, dopes song (my last) 
 Dope Song, dopes song, dopes song (my last)
