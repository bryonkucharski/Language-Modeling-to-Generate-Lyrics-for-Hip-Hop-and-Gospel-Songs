I act like I'm that baby Brenda threw away 
 But I shine like I never seen a rainy day 
 Kinda cloudy like them diamonds that them rappers wear 
 Clownin' like jesters that be in front of kings chairs 
 But they don't make a crown big enough to fit my head 
 My self-esteem high, see it can nest eggs 
 I'm sipping vodka straight, eating on fish eggs 
 Cashmere, and the color pastel 
 Used to have that crack like the liberty bell 
 But now I hit chicks with lips like Estelle 
 New SL, lights like fish eyes 
 Bitches say the dick good like Mickey D's French fries 
 Y'all never held weight sorta like a (?) 
 Think you're doing bad? Think about Apartheid 
 Look in a narc's eyes, ask him why he flicked me 
 Said, "Brown, I had to; just look at your history" 
 Tried to tell the dude the truth 
 He still reminiscing when he used to lock me up for curfew 
 But I was just a young nigga staying past street lights 
 Kinda fascinated finding out what the streets like 
 Learned my lesson, for sure changed my ways 
 But the hook still treat me like the kid I was yesterday 
 And I'm still that nigga 
 We just getting started, roll another swisher 
 Crack another brew, cop another fifth 
 These rap niggas trash and all their beats filth 
 I pull up on them, my hat on tilt 
 The cutty sitting high like Shaq on stilts 
 It's like a unidentified foreign object 
 How you describe Brown as simple as a clock tick 
 But his beats harder than a witch nipple 
 Crazy as a hippie with a rifle sipping ripple 
 Beat you with a mini bat 'til you reconsider that 
 That chain looking rusty dog, get rid of that 
 I'm a pirate with the pyrex 
 Might fuck a bitch raw, Magic ain't died yet 
 Y'all niggas flow like cable, just the basic channel 
 Dough in front the fireplace, stack center mantel 
 Pleading guilty to anything they offer us 
 Copping out like quitting police officers 
 But we off it bruh, cases we forfeit 
 6's high, hope the 24's fit 
 Instigate beef and we all get torched 
 In the middle of the bull, like united center half court 
 Blow newport, laughing at you hoes 
 Hitting y'all raw like wetting Gizmo 
 After twelve, how can I excel 
 In the city where niggas don't know what's real 
 And I'm still that nigga 
 We just getting started, roll another swisher 
 Crack another brew, cop another fifth 
 These rap niggas trash and all their beats filth 
 I pull up on them, my hat on tilt 
 The cutty sitting high like Shaq on stilts
