I start to wonder where the time goes 
 No matter how much I ignore 
 The thoughts are cloudy in the marijuana sky 
 But it started raining molly 
 It got me feeling sorry while I'm feeling on myself 
 'Cause I don't know this bitch name but I'm feeling on her breast 
 I know it ain't right, but in this state I don't care 
 A whole week done went past, I ain't gone nowhere 
 Hotel rooms crushing pills and menus 
 Daughter sending me messages saying "Daddy, I miss you" 
 But in this condition I don't think she need to see me 
 Ain't slept in four days and I'm smelling like seaweed 
 Problems in my past haunt my future and the present 
 Escaping from reality got me missing my blessings 
 Sent a couple G's but that make it no better 
 And now I got habits that ain't getting no better 
 And it ain't that easy tryna get it all together 
 Been stressing so long, think depression done settled 
 It's time for me to clean it up 
 I came too far to fuck it up, like 
 It's time for me to clean it up

 Pops left mom when I was only eighteen 
 So rightfully that means I had to be the man of things 
 And by 28, mom was damn near homeless 
 And now I'm 31, she 'bout to fucking cop her own shit 
 Triple beam dreams brought me nothing but nightmares 
 Thought that I was helping but the system don't fight fair 
 Cases had me locked up, mama always wrote me 
 Pops my only visit, they the only ones that loved me 
 That's why I feel bad, popping Givenchy tags 
 Knowing that this tee could feed my nephew for a week 
 For material I'm weak, acting like I don't care 
 I spend it all on clothes, then something is wrong there 
 I sent my mom some G's, but that makes it no better 
 'Cause now I got habits that ain't getting no better 
 And it ain't that easy tryna get it all together 
 I been stressing so long, think depression done settled 
 It's time for me to clean it up 
 I came too far to fuck it up, like
