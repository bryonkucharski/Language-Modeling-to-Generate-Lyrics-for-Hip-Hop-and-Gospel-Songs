Can you work it 
 Can you work it 
 Break it down 
 And just drop it low 
 You deserve it 
 You deserve it 
 Get it out 
 And let it all go 
 Shake it 
 Don't break it 
 Bend over 
 And touch yo toes 
 You been waiting 
 You been waiting 
 Real playa 
 Get down on the floor 
 I know lately I know lately 
 You been feeling 
 Like you wanna let loose 
 No debating 
 No debating 
 Do your thing 
 And just do you 
 No hating 
 No hating 
 Whatever it's 
 All on you 
 Put it on me 
 Put it on me 
 Lemme tell ya 
 What we gon' do 
 Dance in the water 
 And not get wet 
 Not get wet 
 Not get wet 
 Dance in the water 
 And not get wet 
 Not get wet 
 Not get wet 
 Dance in the water 
 And not get wet 
 Not get wet 
 Not get wet 
 Dance in the water 
 And not get wet 
 Not get wet 
 Not get wet 
 Is you wit it 
 Is you wit it 
 Lemme see you just 
 Get get get it 
 Get busy 
 Get busy 
 Back it up 
 And just quit playing wit me 
 If you want it 
 If you want it 
 It's all yours then 
 Gone head and own it 
 When you get it 
 When you get it 
 Go and give it to 'em right 
 'Cause you earned it 
 Here we go now 
 Here we go now 
 Don't stop what you're doing 
 Don't slow down 
 Gone take that 
 Gone take that 
 Like P. Diddy 
 Remix on a mixtape 
 Better get back 
 Better get back 
 They ain't know 
 You could do it like that 
 Can I hit that 
 Can I hit that 
 Like a champion 
 Boxing title match 
 Dance in the water 
 And not get wet 
 Not get wet 
 Not get wet 
 Dance in the water 
 And not get wet 
 Not get wet 
 Not get wet 
 Dance in the water 
 And not get wet 
 Not get wet 
 Not get wet 
 Dance in the water 
 And not get wet 
 Not get wet 
 Not get wet 
 Bring it back now 
 Bring it back now 
 Get into it 
 And just put it back now 
 It's like that now 
 It's like that now 
 Make a playa 
 Wanna go say his wedding vows 
 Don't stop now 
 Don't stop now 
 Keep it going 
 Just gone head get down 
 I mean right now 
 I mean right now 
 See you showing off 
 Gone head show out 
 Do you like that 
 Do you like that 
 Can't never fall off 
 Get it right back 
 I mean right back 
 I mean right back 
 Bout to body slam 
 That like Ryback 
 Gotta fever 
 Gotta fever 
 Only remedy is you 
 And I need ya 
 He a monster 
 He a creature 
 He a tie you up 
 And then eat ya 
 Dance in the water 
 And not get wet 
 Not get wet 
 Not get wet 
 Dance in the water 
 And not get wet 
 Not get wet 
 Not get wet 
 Dance in the water 
 And not get wet 
 Not get wet 
 Not get wet 
 Dance in the water 
 And not get wet 
 Not get wet 
 Not get wet
