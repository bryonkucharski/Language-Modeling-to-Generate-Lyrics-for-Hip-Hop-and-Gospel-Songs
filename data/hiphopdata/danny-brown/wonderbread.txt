On my way to get Wonderbread 
 I swear I just want the bread 
 Mommy gave me a book of food stamps 
 Said "Go get some bread and a pop and come back" 
 Walk out the door, first thing I see 
 A dope fiend standing there looking at me 
 Standing right there in front of the porch 
 With a pipe in his hand, in the other, a torch 
 I kept on moving, ain't worried 'bout that 
 'Bout a block later heard rat-tat-tat-tat 
 Next, some niggas from over there shooting 
 Dog, I ain't blinked just kept it a-moving 
 Block later up, what do I find? 
 A junkie ho, at left and right, crime 
 Flagging up cars, getting her bread 
 And that's what I seen on the way to get bread 
 On my way to get Wonderbread 
 I swear I just want the bread 
 On my way to get Wonderbread 
 I swear I just want the bread 
 On my way to get Wonderbread 
 I swear I just want the bread 
 On my way to get Wonderbread 
 I swear I just want the bread 
 Mommy gave me a book of food stamps 
 Said "Go get some bread and a pop and come back" 
 Get to the store, first thing I see 
 Arab dude just staring at me 
 Looking at me like I'm 'bout to steal 
 But really though dawg, you need to go chill 
 Grabbed what I needed, left out the do' 
 Two little boys in front of the sto' 
 Fiends running up, running through alleys 
 I kept on moving, nobody looked at me 
 Course some niggas stomped on my head 
 All because they wanted the bread 
 On my way to get Wonderbread 
 I swear I just want the bread 
 On my way to get Wonderbread 
 I swear I just want the bread 
 On my way to get Wonderbread 
 I swear I just want the bread
