Mmm, yeah, uh 
 Mind playing tricks on me, man 
 It's a, regular day and a regular routine 
 Till I hear this tragic news from about two fiends 
 Your man 50, just got popped 9 times 
 And I heard through the grapevines it's all 'cause he rhymes 
 In front of his grandma I'm standin' on the lawn 
 Wearin' no Teflon, I wonder if he gone 
 I know in my heart I wanna cry 
 Havin' thoughts in my mind is my man gon' die? 
 As I frantically run towards 50 spot 
 I panicky peep like fifty cops 
 It was blue and whites, DT's and homicide 
 With yellow tape locked off on both sides 
 With four-fifth shells on the floor 
 And DT's ringin' doorbells, goin' door to door 
 Yo I'm stressed out, smokin' bogie after bogie 
 Duckin' the sarge 'cause the sarge fuckin' know me 
 I jumped in Jeep truck and got a mac to spit 
 And we did about a buck 'cause Mary Mack I lit 
 At the time, I started thinkin' back some shit 
 How we used to sling crack and stack our chips 
 With Kev, P-Low, Big Jewel the Kid 
 And my man 50 used to smack a bitch 
 And the good and the bad on the 1 3 4 
 And them hoes that we had on the Cash Money tour 
 Now I'm at the hospital, stop day-dreamin' 
 All I see is 5 5 1 and there's beefin' 
 Baby moms is screamin', whole family grievin' 
 But the word is that my man's still breathin' 
 I dropped to my knees and I thanked the Lord 
 And got a long shit list all across the board, motherf'
