"Be A Gentleman" 
 It's best you be a gentleman 
 And you watch what you say (bwah nigga take that) 
 'Cause Jesus Christ can't save you when you on gangster prey 
 (50 Cent) 
 Yo, no more freestyles and verses killin' Sticky and Ja 
 I've movin' on now, I got bigger fish to fry 
 Since 'How to Rob' a lot of niggas been naming names 
 Monkey see monkey do, I done changed the game 
 Still niggas acting like I don't get down or something 
 Like I ain't the next nigga to wear the crown or something 
 You gonna talk about your chips till we run in your crib 
 And you gone ask dumb questions like "Can I Live?" 
 Look, If I shoot you, I'm famous 
 If you shoot me your brainless, you said it yourself 
 I'm slick enough to twist your lines and send them back at you 
 Swift enough to snatch the mack and pop that at you 
 Take it personal see if I won't send you to hell 
 I've done told Ton and Pok? they better have my bail 
 But if it's over a mil don't put the crib up dun 
 'Cause if 50 get free nigga, 50 gonna run 
 It's best you be a gentleman 
 And you watch what you say (bwah bwah, nigga take that) 
 Or Jesus Christ can't save you once you go gangsta, friend 
 (Bo! bo! bo! bo! bo!...It's gangsta) 
 (50 Cent) 
 Look I'm supposed to be cocky, I ain't a po' no mo' 
 I ain't gotta steal from the corna' store no mo' 
 Got my own crib, I ain't sleepin' on the flo' no mo' 
 Bouncers don't try to play me at the do' no mo' 
 But when they see me they say search him 
 "He might have the nine 
 He might shoot this motherfucker up like Shyne" 
 It's been a while since a new nigga came tight like this 
 Ya man, he aight, but he ain't quite like this 
 Niggas is feelin' it 
 The Benz pullin up on the set (uh huh) 
 Me jumpin' out 30 tho on my neck (uh huh uh huh) 
 And since you said it was nothin' to sweat (what) 
 That you was outta line so here's what you get 
 A verbal ass kickin' 
 Jesus Christ sent me to test ya 
 Let's see how see how he act's under pressure 
 Till Makaveli returns it's 'All Eyez On Me' 
 Till the feds build up cases and find pie's on me 
 It's best you be a gentleman 
 And you watch what you say (bwah bwah bwah, bwah nigga take that) 
 Or Jesus Christ can't save you once you go gangsta, friend 
 (Bo! bo! bo!, It's gangsta) 
 It's gangsta, 2000 shit 
 (Echoing) 
 Y'all know what you need to do, get together, 
 Make a We Are The World record, faggot ass niggas)
