We gotta get the get well cards 
 Niggaz is sick... feel this... 
 Motion Picture shit 
 Now Don't think I won't hit you 'cause I'm popular 
 I got a P-90 Ruger to pop at ya 
 Catch ya slippin I'mma give you what I got fa ya 
 My clip load every 16 shots fa ya 
 You never had a hot gun on ya waist 
 And blood on ya shoes 
 Cause a nigga went and said the wrong shit to you 
 Homey you ain't been through 
 What I been through 
 You not like me 
 And I'm not like you 
 I'm like a 
 Animal wit it when I spit it it's crazy 
 Got semi-autos to put holes in niggas trying to play me 
 One shot is not enough you need least a oozie to move me 
 After four bottles of Don the kid starts feelin' woozey 
 I write my life you write what you seen in gangsta movies 
 I'm gangsta to the core nigga you can't move me 
 I find my space at the top I got this rap shit locked 
 I never heard of you 
 You heard of me 
 I murder you 
 Spit shells through your convertable 
 Load this you notice 
 Rich or poor hollows still go through your door 
 This is war 
 Ya scared of me ya not prepared for me the kid is back 
 50 Cent 
 I know you like that 
 Yeah I know you like that 
 Green lantern, Shady Records, Anger Management Tour homie, homie, 
 Yeah
