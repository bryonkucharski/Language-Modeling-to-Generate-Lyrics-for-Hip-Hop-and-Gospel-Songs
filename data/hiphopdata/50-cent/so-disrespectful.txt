(50 Cent - Chorus) 
 I'm so disrespectful, 
 So so so disrespectful, 
 I'm so disrespectful, 
 So so so disrespectful, 
 You daddy f-cked your momma then f-cked your sister, 
 Then climbed in your bed playing with your sh-tter, 
 Go 'head take your belt off and hang yourself, 
 Matter of fact grab your strap and bang yourself, 
 Jay's a big man, he's too big to respond, 
 Imma big d-ck you know the one everybody on, 
 Your gon make me sing murder was the case 
 Pull this trigger sh-t ping ping, should start at the face, 
 I'm international, I'm never home mayne, 
 I've gon so long my accent changed, 
 Better watch who you f-ck with mayne, 
 Or you gon make me carve you up now straight 
 Come on Game you'll never be my equal, 
 Your homie shoot dogs, my n-gga shoot people, 
 See me I'm what your never gon be, 
 I'm in that tax bracket your never gon see, 
 When you cross me... 
 That n-gga Buck like Game tell momma he don smoked the TV, 
 I didn't know he f-cked with more dope than BG, 
 Plus a n-gga sipped more syrup than Pepsi, 
 Man keeping these muthf-ckers rich ain't easy, 
 Especially when a n-gga wanna stunt like Jeezy, 
 And his cds didn't sell like his CD's, 
 Man that n-gga blew all of his chips like breezy's, 
 Mad 'cause the world won't treat him like Weezy, 
 I don't give a f-ck n-gga please believe me,

 No n-gga in the vocal booth around can see me, 
 It's crazy how I make this sh-t sound oh so easy, 
 They say fifty not on Buck with him he oh so greasy, 
 Yeah he used to share that paper now he oh so greedy, 
 Its funny how they sh-t on n-ggas then they need me, 
 See me I'm number one I'm loading up my gun, 
 I catch ya if you dun, you p-ssy n-gga run, 
 They say first comes love then comes marriage, 
 Instead I got Shaniqua in the baby carriage, 
 Then came the cash then the baby momma drama, 
 I gave the b-tch a half a mill, 
 She blew it on prada, 
 I remember when I met da b-tch and she ain't had nada, 
 Now got my son on some fly sh-t, 
 Lyrics courtesy of killerhiphop.com 
 Now I got to buy sh-t, 
 Man I can't even flunk sh-t 'cause everybody want sh-t, 
 Everybody mad, damn even my dad, 
 And I don't even know him now how the f-ck I owe him, 
 I ain't giving nobody sh-t Imma show them, 
 I gave Game hits, he told me to suck d-ck, 
 Start screaming Wesstside and Dre ain't say sh-t, 
 Now we just eat of 'em and when I talk to Em 
 A smile comes on his face, 
 He told me what's the case, 
 Enemies stay enemies, 
 But friends they change, 
 N-ggas go crazy over money my mayne,
