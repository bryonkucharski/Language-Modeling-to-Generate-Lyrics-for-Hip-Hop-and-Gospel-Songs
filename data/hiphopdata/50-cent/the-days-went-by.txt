This is how monster's function 
 Leave me alone, 
 I ain't fuckin' with nobody 
 Keep fuckin' with me you gon' turn me back to Boo Boo 
 Have me casin' out your crib, tryna pop your fuckin' noodles 
 She was twenty I was twelve, man my Nana said she raped me 
 I jus' smiled from ear to ear, sayin' take me baby take me 
 Since high school, nigga I ain't got no friends 
 Got two Three-Eighty's like the Ying Yang Twins, ah, 
 That's spot clickin' till the D's run in 
 Then it's bail money and lawyer fees you got to have ends 
 Freshman year I had that C-B-R Hurricane 
 In a ill Herringbone I got 'um swingin' Heroine 
 I shoot a nigga in a heartbeat I ain't no chump 
 Then you can run Forrest run retard when I dump 
 They take kindness for weakness, niggas don't respect that 
 So me I'm where that Reuger, that Pump and that Tech at 
 Some look at me I'm on now, I thought we was rich then 
 Shit man, but you had like, twenty bricks in Richmond 
 We was in Cocaine heaven, I was fish scale dreamin' 
 We jus' got in the town, we was strapped up schemin' 
 First Country caught a body, then country caught a body then 
 I popped a couple niggas, then country shot everybody 
 It's cold blooded, it's real shit you got to love it 
 Tre-Eight Snub it, and don't think nothin' of it 
 It's the way of the wolves, it's how they train us to move 
 Get it poppin' when we shoppin' niggas hold down the two's 
 I seen niggas gettin' rich, 
 Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by, 
 I was tired of havin' shit, 
 Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by, 
 I seen niggas gettin' hit, 
 Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by, 
 We was slingin' that shit, 
 Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by, 
 Here I am 
 Yeah, 
 I was ? since we was little niggas son since we were seven 
 Armed robbery, first degree, my man did seven 
 Niggas popped his whip up, hit his can we were seven 
 He a lucky motherfucker I bet he make it to heaven 
 My Grandpa drunk, my uncle Rock drunk 
 My uncle Champ pump crack, smoked my fuckin' stash up 
 I had two-hundred and fifty grams stashed on the porch 
 I mean I'm what you call smoke man, I'm what you call snort 
 First the VCR went, then the TV went 
 He stole outta mommy purse, she thought it was me kid 
 I ain't ask her for no money son 'cause I was out hustlin' 
 She was lookin' at me sideways like I'm a thief or somethin' 
 That hurt me, c'mon son that wouldn't hurt you 
 I pistol whip that nigga till his face was purple 
 I need anger management, see I hold on to a grudge 
 The same way I hold on to that nickel-plate Snub, 
 The Lord don't have imperfections baby, 
 So I think I'm perfect the way he made me, 
 Some say I'm cool, some say I'm crazy, 
 Some say I ain't shit, some say I'm amasin' 
 I seen niggas gettin' rich, 
 Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by, 
 I was tired of havin' shit, 
 Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by, 
 I seen niggas gettin' hit, 
 Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by, 
 We was slingin' that shit, 
 Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by, 
 Here I am
