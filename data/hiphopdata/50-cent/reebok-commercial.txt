(Verse 1: 50 Cent) 
 Man I told y'all I was finnin' to blow like C4 
 Stunt in the G5 fly in the G4 
 G Unit footwear, G Unit apparell 
 I'm so hood 
 That green and that white looks so good 
 Hip Hop man we gon take it to the next level 
 Kicks match that hat and that throwback 
 Kicks stay color coordinated man you know that 
 Truth is I ain't got a jump shot but I got a left hook 
 I don't swing golf clubs but I sell like Golf Brooks 
 I'm hot man 
 I rocky rock man 
 If it ain't the G Unit it's the S Dot man 
 (Verse 2: Jay-Z) 
 S. Dots takin' off G4s 'bout to land 
 See how we cross brand 
 We boss about it man 
 Got the sole of the old Guccis if you upset sue me 
 If not sit back and watch me do me 
 Parking lot pimpin' sideline ballers 
 We don't sweat up we fresh let the girls do it for us 
 The watch talk for me 
 Drop talk for he 
 Brand new S Dots walk with me 
 Sort of like you just scored a bucket 
 Bootlegger you frontin' you walkin' awkardly 
 Ho its nothing keep score with me 
 Give me three hot seconds 
 I'll bring heat rock records
