Yeah, we stop fucking with theses niggaz 
 It's real, it's real, yo 
 This money done got a nigga like me in trouble 
 I made it niggaz hated, leave me dead, they beloved to 
 Mommy, before I walked up out that door, I should've hugged you 
 Who's my real friends, seems I'm living in a bubble 
 For crying like a bitch, nigga, get your fucking firearm 
 Got me blowing hollow tips right at your Teflon 
 Nigga, stick and move if you ain't getting stepped on 
 No heat? That's like a cop without his vest on 
 We bugging, constantly thugging, we ain't showing no loving 
 Ice griller than slugging face the repercussion 
 Niggaz stomach is touching, it's real, not for nothing 
 Keep faking and fronting, you know it's gonna be something 
 They say you live and you learn, niggaz never will learn 
 Burn heavily burn when streets and music merge 
 Niggaz coming at me sideways 
 Nigga, get your hammer and let's do this the right way, for real 
 You know we pop those thangs 
 (Yo, you scared get it, dog, you gully get a gun) 
 You know we pop those thangs

 If you scared, nigga, get a gun, don't go get a dog 
 Got a 44 long to put your ass in a morgue 
 You peace talk with your pistol, I send niggaz to get you 
 Ten grand to hit you, the shells are sure to split you 
 You chrome spot, drop gun in the stash box 
 Get your bitch ass shot, standing around here 
 The flow so hot, they say I got it locked 
 Hold on a second, homey, let's get this clear 
 The wrist stay rocked, the Ruger stay cocked 
 I hope you smoke a lot 'cause I supply a weed spot 
 Now I got a question and I need the answer on the spot 
 That bitch you with, she like you or she like what you got? 
 It's 50 Cent and M O B B, breath easy 
 We ain't finna kill nothing, we just chilling, nigga 
 But look, dog, don't go acting loco 
 You in Queens, you a long way from Kansas 
 You know we pop those thangs

 Ay, yo, why dudes walk around with those on the hip? 
 The pocket or the box, nigga, wherever they fit 
 You know we done been through the worst of the shit 
 All we know is how to survive, y'all niggaz eat a dick 
 Eat it quick, eat your food through the I.V, fucking with P 
 Need a plastic bag attachment to shit? 
 Y'all make us so real, ice grill faces before them guns popped out 
 Now you look like you seen death 
 You ain't ready for murder, don't play with these kids 
 Upgrade to a set of wings fucking with my clique 
 Basically be a cold case fav real quick 
 People that enjoy life, they don't come to our set, place your bets 
 Your favorite rap is sex, I swell up niggaz heads 
 Frail niggaz is dead, better get your weight up, yeah 
 You heard what we said, bird niggaz ain't deaf 
 Fuck y'all wanna do about it, huh? Straight up
