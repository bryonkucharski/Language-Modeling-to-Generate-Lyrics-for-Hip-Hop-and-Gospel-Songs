I woke up this morning, this is insane 
 Rich as a motherfucker, and ain't much changed 
 Open my eyes, no surprise, I'm with a different bitch 
 Different day, different ass, different tits 
 Strap under my pillow, I done went legit 
 I'm not supposed to do this shit, but I forget 
 The true principles of life are supply and demand 
 Guess if you never sold dope it's hard to understand 
 My man got knowledge of self and my back, God 
 Find out today's mathematics when that Mac go off 
 My temper volatile, grew up a violent child 
 Fuck a boy scout, I air your ass out 
 Nigga, nice chain, dice game, try your luck 
 Shoot a couple head cracks, leave wipe you up 
 I'm a fly nigga, my denim vintage 
 Gold medal around my neck like I won the Olympics 
 We came from nothing, now they saying we straight 
 Nigga, hold up, hold on 
 Hold on 
 These niggas, they watching every dime we make 
 Hold up, hold on 
 Hold on 
 We want that deluxe apartment in the sky with a clear view 
 Instead we get the D's in the rear view 
 We learn to play the game how it's supposed to be played 
 And so you know, you violate, you supposed to be sprayed 
 It's not a big deal to me, stay calm 
 I'll shoot the shit out of a nigga, then call it Barrel Bonds 
 But, if I don't do this shit myself, bet I'll get it done 
 Shit on my nigga, you shit on me, we of one 
 Used to do graffiti, now look we major 
 Don't make me write my name across your face with a razor 
 Re-Up, new coke, they say this sample the bomb 
 This shit can take a two and we cut this bitch with a one 
 Watch the fiends stand in line for the potency 
 No lactose involved, pure coco leaf 
 You can sniff that or cook that to my belief 
 That money coming in like we run the streets 
 We came from nothing, now they saying we straight 
 Nigga, hold up, hold on 
 Hold on 
 These niggas, they watching every dime we make 
 Hold up, hold on 
 Hold on 
 This shit go how I said, go when it's time to expand 
 So say it's over your dead body and that's the plan 
 You a gangster for real, you ready to ride? 
 Nigga, you gonna die a bad case of too much pride 
 Check my DNA, homie I'm a different kind 
 Hit the speed dial, that quick I'll get ya lined 
 We don't want your block, just cop your work from us 
 Those niggas you call allies can't be trust 
 That Rollie all gold, I got the Midas touch 
 Sometimes it's hard as hell not to touch stuff 
 On the phone I heard 'Ya smacked the shit outta a kid 
 Now Jimmy got life, gonna smack him again 
 When it's war, it'll be war to the very end 
 If they ever say we lose, I start it again 
 Let's sneak the niggas spray that Semi at your momma crib 
 With a silencer we couldn't even hear that shit 
 We came from nothing, now they saying we straight 
 Nigga, hold up, hold on 
 Hold on 
 These niggas, they watching every dime we make 
 Hold up, hold on 
 Hold on
