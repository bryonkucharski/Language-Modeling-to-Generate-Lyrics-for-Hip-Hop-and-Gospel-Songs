(Chorus: 50 Cent) 
 This is how we do 
 We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club 
 This is how we do 
 Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love 
 This is how we do 
 We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club 
 This is how we do 
 Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love 
 (Game) 
 Fresh like... Impala... 
 Crome hydraulics, 808 drums 
 You don't want, none 
 Nigga better, run 
 When beef is on, I'll pop that, drum 
 Come get, some 
 Pistol grip, pump 
 If a nigga step on my white And, Ones 
 Since red, rum 
 Ready here I, come 
 Compton... 
 Dre found me in the, slums 
 Selling that skunk, one hand on my gun 
 I was selling rocks when Master P was saying... 
 Buck pass the blunt 
 These G-Unit girls just want to have, fun 
 Coke and rum 
 Got weed on the ton 
 I'm banging with my hand up her dress like... 
 I'll make her cum, purple haze in my lungs 
 Whole gang in the front in case a nigga want to, stunt 
 (50 Cent) 
 I put Lamborghini doors on that Es-co-lade 
 Lil pro so look like I'm riding on blades 
 In one year man, a nigga's so paid 
 I have a straight bitch in the telly going both ways (Ah!) 
 Touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me 
 I give it to ya just how you like it, girl 
 You know I'm rocking with the best tre pound on my hip 
 Teflon on my chest 
 They say I'm no good 
 'Cause I'm so hood 
 Rich folks do not want me around 
 Cause shit might pop off, and if shit pop off 
 Somebody goin' get laid the fuck out 
 They call me new money, say I have no class 
 I'm from the bottom, I came up too fast 
 The hell if I care, I'm just here to get my cash 
 Bougie ass bitches, you can kiss my ass 
 (Game) 
 I put gold Dayton's on that Cherry Six-Four 
 White walls so clean it's like I'm riding on bulbs 
 Hit one switch man, that ass so low 
 Cali got niggas in New York riding on hundred spokes 
 Touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me 
 I give it to ya just how you like it, girl 
 You know I'm rocking with the best fo' pound on my hip 
 Gold chain on my chest (Ah!) 
 (50 Cent) 
 50... 
 Bentley... 
 Em came 'n' gotta nigga fresh out the, slum 
 Automatic, gun 
 Fuck 'em one-on-one 
 We wrap up ya punk ass, stunt 'n' ya done 
 Homie, it's Game time 
 (Game) 
 You ready? Here I come 
 Call Lloyd Banks and get this motherfucker, crunk 
 It took two, months 
 But Fifty got it done 
 Signed with G-unit 
 Had niggas like, "huh?" 
 Don't try to front 
 I'll leave yo' ass, slumped 
 Thinking I'm a punk 
 Get your fucking head, lumped 
 Fifty got a, gun 
 (50 Cent) 
 Ready here he come 
 Gotta sick, vendetta 
 To get this, chedder 
 Meet my Ba, Retta 
 The dra-ma, setter 
 Sip Am-a, retta 
 My flow sounds, better 
 Than average 
 On tracks I'm a savage 
 I damage 
 Any nigga tryin' to front on my clique (G-Unit!)
