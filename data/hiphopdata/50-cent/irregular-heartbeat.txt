Nigga, you pussy, you scared 
 I can hear your heartbeat 
 Why the fuck would you come around here? 
 I can hear your heartbeat 
 Yeah, you know a dog sense fear 
 I can hear your heartbeat 
 You bark while we bite around here 
 I can hear your heartbeat 
 We ain't cut from the same cloth, we into different shit 
 I want the bread, you want the bitch 
 Come out your mouth slick I'll get you hit 
 My niggas hungry, they hit a lick 
 Fuck who you're with, niggas'll dump a clip 
 We by the school yard waiting for you to get your kid 
 I caught a A1 felony on my last bid 
 Kept calm, made bond, I'm on that shit 
 You think my rap shit a gimmick, I ain't seen parole in a minute 
 Truth be told these niggas is hoes 
 Once the shit set off, man, anything goes 
 Through the windows of your soul, the eyes never lie 
 If you ain't scared to die, nigga, why would you cry? 
 Nigga, you pussy, you scared 
 I can hear your heartbeat 
 Why the fuck would you come around here? 
 I can hear your heartbeat 
 Yeah, you know a dog sense fear 
 I can hear your heartbeat 
 You bark while we bite around here 
 I can hear your heartbeat 
 30 something and you ain't never open your mouth yet 
 Social media is giving cowards an outlet 
 See him in person, say something, I doubt that 
 Rather get caught with it than get caught without that 
 Trying to back peddle and stumble on the curve 
 You stayin' at the ground, you mumblin' your words 
 Literally I can see your heart pumpin' through your shirt 
 Pussy your whole life, you always been a bird 
 Scared for so long it's all up in your nerves 
 Screw 9-1-1, you probably call up the reserves 
 And I'm killin' you first, if we ever do a purge 
 And you know what it is, kid, whenever we emerge 
 And I'm tragical, traumatical, no match, incompatible 
 Nigga, you vaginal 
 Nigga, you pussy, you scared 
 I can hear your heartbeat 
 Why the fuck would you come around here? 
 I can hear your heartbeat 
 Yeah, you know a dog sense fear 
 I can hear your heartbeat 
 You bark while we bite around here 
 I can hear your heartbeat 
 Money for bail, money to bail 
 Dead or in jail, Heaven or Hell 
 FEDs on my coat tail, snitches given court tales 
 Kept fate when all hope fail 
 Niggas rattin', all they missin' is the tail like Mickey Mouse 
 Call me Mickey Mantle when I bat you in the mouth 
 I bring them hammers out, we ain't trying to build a house 
 Niggas on them songs rappin' shit they ain't about 
 I'm from the N-O, we don't scrap, we bang it out 
 Bang, I'm the one that came in your house for the chickens 
 Left a nigga brains hangin' out like we chillin' 
 Stankin' like shipments, over my shillings 
 Hump your security, Rida gang in the building 
 Nigga, you pussy, you scared 
 I can hear your heartbeat 
 Why the fuck would you come around here? 
 I can hear your heartbeat 
 Yeah, you know a dog sense fear 
 I can hear your heartbeat 
 You bark while we bite around here 
 I can hear your heartbeat
