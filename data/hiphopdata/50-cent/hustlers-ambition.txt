(Girl singing: 
 Like the fire needs the air 
 I won't burn unless you're there) 
 Yeah, I need you, I need you to hate 
 So I can use you for your energy 
 You know, this real shit, feel this! 
 America got a thing for this gangsta' shit, they love me 
 Black Chuckas, black skullies, leather Pelle-Pelle 
 I take Spit over Raymo shit, I'm a vandal 
 Got the silver duct tape on my tray eight handle 
 The women in my life be confusion and shit 
 SO like Nino when New Jack, I holla "cancel that bitch" 
 Look at me, this is the life I chose 
 Niggaz around me so cold, man my heart dun froze 
 I built an empire on the low the narc's don't know 
 I'm the weatherman 
 I take that cocoa leaf and make that snow 
 Sit back, watch it turn to dough, watch it go out the door 
 O after O, you know, homie I'm just triple beam, dreamin' 
 Niggaz be schemin', I fiend to live a good life 
 The fiends are just fiendin 
 Conceal my weapon nice and easy so you can't see 
 The penitentiary is definitely out the question for me... 
 I want the finer things in my life 
 So I hustle (hustle) 
 Nigga you get in my way while I'm tryin' get mine, 
 And I'll buck you (buck you) 
 I don't care who you run with, or where you from 
 Nigga fuck you (fuck you) 
 I want the finer things in my life 
 So I hustle (hustle) 
 Yeah, I don't know shit about gymnastics I summersault bricks 
 Black Talons start flyin, when a nigga flip 
 I cook crack in the microwave, niggaz can't fuck with me 
 Man my code name, they called me chef boy r 50 
 Check my logic, smokers don't like seeds in their weed, shit 
 Send me them seeds I'll grow 'em what they need 
 Them ain't chia pet plants in the crib, that's chronic 
 And I'm sellin 'em for 500 a pop god damn it 
 I sell anything I'ma hustler, I know how to grind 
 Step on grapes put in water and tell you it's wine 
 If you analyze me, what you'll find is the DNA of a crook and 
 What goes in my mind, its contagious 
 Hypnotic, it sounds melodic 
 If rap was the block or spot, I'll be potent product 
 Now get a load of me, flashy, far from low key 
 And you can locate me where ever that dope be, gettin' money man 
 I want the finer things in my life 
 So I hustle (hustle) 
 Nigga you get in my way while I'm tryin' get mine 
 And I'll buck you (buck you) 
 I don't care who you run with, or where you from 
 Nigga fuck you (fuck you) 
 I want the finer things in my life 
 So I hustle (hustle) 
 It's a hustler's ambition, close your eyes listen, see my vision 
 Moussberg pumpin, shotgun dumpin' the drama means nothin' 
 It's part of the game, catch me in the coupe switchin lanes 
 Or in the jewler switchin chains 
 I upgrade from 30 Bs to clean Vs 
 Rocks that I copped proceeds from the spot 
 I got the energy to win, I'm full of adrenaline 
 Play the curv and get nauseous, watchin the spinner spin 
 I'ma plan to make it, a prisoner of the state 
 Now I can invite yo ass out to my estate 
 Them hollow tips bent me up, but I'm back in shape 
 Pour Crystal in the blender and make a protein shake 
 I'm like the East coast number one playboy B 
 Hugh Hefner will tell you he ain't got shit on me 
 The feds watch me, Icey, they can't stop me 
 Racist, pointin at me look at the niggaracci 
 Hello! 
 I want the finer things in my life 
 So I hustle (hustle)

 And I'll buck you (buck you) 
 I don't care who you run with, or where you from 
 Nigga fuck you (fuck you) 
 I want the finer things in my life 
 So I hustle (hustle)
