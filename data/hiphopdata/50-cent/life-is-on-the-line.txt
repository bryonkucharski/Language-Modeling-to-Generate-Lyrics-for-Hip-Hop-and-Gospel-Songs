Nobody likes me, nobody likes me, but that's okay 
 'Cause I don't like y'all anyway 
 And I don't like y'all anyway 
 (Fuck all y'all) 
 My watch talk for me, my whip talk for me 
 My gat talk for me 
 (Blat) 
 What up homie, for bitches who don't know me 
 They wanna blow me, 'cause the shit I floss wit is sayin' a lot for me 
 I came in the rap humble, I don't give a fuck now 
 Serve anybody like niggaz who hustle uptown 
 Coke price go up, cats come down 
 The D's run in my crib, I'm nowhere to be found 
 The niggaz who do hustle for me, they don't even stash tracks 
 They keep it on 'em, right there in they ass crack 
 When I don't like a nigga, I don't pretend to 
 I'll have the paramedics wrap your fuckin' head like a Hindu 
 Look, I ain't goin' nowhere, so get used to me 
 OG's look at me and see I'm what they used to be 
 I'm that nigga that sold coke, the nigga that sold dope 
 The nigga that shot dice when broke to so so 
 The thug, that pop shit, the thug that pop clips 
 The thug that went from three and a half to whole bricks 
 Nigga ain't in his right mind, goin' against me 
 My picture's painted through words that make a blind man see 
 Scream murder, I don't believe you 
 Murder, fuck around and leave you 
 Murder, I don't believe you 
 Murder, murder, your life's on the line 
 Y'all niggaz don't want no parts of me 
 I'm tryna figure out how y'all started me 
 You gon' make me catch you on the late night 
 Pop shots wit the fifth and slide off in the six 
 I'm not a marksmen while spark issue, I spray random 
 Not a pretty nigga but my moms think I'm handsome 
 I hate to hear 'He say, she say', shit 
 Unless he say, she say, she on my dick 
 It's no coincidence, niggaz who fuck wit me get shot up 
 I do a Cali style drive by and tear ya block up 
 You soft through, be puttin' up a crazy front 
 I stay wit the Mac, 'cause niggaz tried to blaze me once 
 In the hood they like, "Damn, 50 really spitted on 'em" 
 "You heard that shit?", "Yeah, 50 really shitted on 'em" 
 Beef, you don't want none, so don't start none 
 You just a small player in this game, play your part son 
 Scream murder, I don't believe you 
 Murder, fuck around and leave you 
 Murder, I don't believe you 
 Murder, murder, your life's on the line 
 These cats always escape reality when they rhyme 
 That's why they write about bricks and only dealt wit dimes 
 Leave it to them, and they say they got a fast car 
 Nas car, truck wit a crash bar, and TV's in the dash, pa 
 See 'em in the five wit stock rims, I just laugh, pa 
 I catch stunts when I ain't tryin', I ain't lyin' 
 I sit Dom P till I spit up, keep my rent split up 
 Get outta line, I get you hit up 
 Now, if you say my name in your rhyme, you better watch what you say 
 You get carried away, you can get shot and carried away 
 Now, here's a list of MC's that can kill you in eight bars 
 50, umm, Jay-Z and Nas 
 I'ma say this shit now and never again 
 We ain't buddies, we ain't partners and we damn sure ain't friends 
 The games you playin', you get killed like that 
 Actin' like you all hard, you ain't built like that 
 See me when you see me nigga, what 
 Scream murder, I don't believe you 
 Murder, fuck around and leave you 
 Murder, I don't believe you 
 Murder, murder, your life's on the line 
 Y'all niggaz don't want no parts of me 
 I'm tryna figure out how y'all started me 
 You gon make me catch you on the late night 
 Pop shots wit the fifth and slide off in the six
