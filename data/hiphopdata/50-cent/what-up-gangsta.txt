 Bo! 
 We in here 
 Bo! 
 We can get the drama poppin' 
 We don't care 
 Bo! Bo! Bo! 
 It's goin' down 
 Bo! 
 'Cause I'm around 
 Bo! 
 50 Cent, you know how I get's down 
 What up blood?

 What up cous?

 What up blood? 
 What? 
 What up gangsta? 
 What up blood?

 What up gangsta? 
 They say I walk around like I got an "S" on my chest 
 Naw, that's a semi-auto, and a vest on my chest 
 I try not to say nuttin' the DA might want to play in court 
 But I'll hunt or duck a nigga down like it's sport 
 Front on me, I'll cut ya, gun-butt ya or bump ya 
 You gettin' money? I can't none with ya then fuck ya 
 I'm not the type to get knocked for D.W.I. 
 I'm the type that'll kill your connect when the coke price rise 
 Gangstas they bump my shit then they know me 
 I grew up around some niggas that's not my homies 
 Hundred G's I stash it what? The mack I blast it, yeah 
 D's come we dump the diesel and battery acid 
 This flow's been mastered, the ice I flash it 
 Chokes me, I'll have your mama pickin' out your casket bastard 
 I'm on the next level, right lane forget bezzle 
 Benz pedal to the metal, hotter than a tea kettle, blood.

 We don't play that 
 We don't play that 
 We don't play that 
 G-Unit 
 We don't play around 
 I sit back, twist the best bud, burn and wonder 
 When gangstas bump my shit, can they hear my hunger? 
 When the fifth kick, duck quick, it sound like thunder 
 In December I'll make your block feel like summer 
 The rap critics say I can rhyme, the fiends say my dope is a nine 
 Every chick I fuck with is a dime 
 I'm like Patty LaBelle, homie, I'm on my own 
 Where I lay my hat is my home, I'm a rollin' stone 
 Cross my path I'll crush ya, thinkin' I won't touch ya 
 I'll have your ass usin' a wheelchair, cane, or crutches 
 Industry hoe fuckers, in the hood they love us 
 Stomp a bone out your ass with some brand new chuckas.
