It's 50 A.K.A. Ferrari, F 50 
 Break it down 
 I got a lot of living to do for a die 
 And I ain't got time to waste 
 Let's make it 
 You said you a gangster 
 But you neva pop nothin' 
 You said you a wangster 
 And you need to stop frontin' 
 You ain't a friend of mine 
 You ain't a kind of mine 
 What makes you think that 
 I'ma run up on you with the nine 
 We do this all the time 
 Right now we on the grind 
 So hurry up and cop 
 And go we selling nicks and dimes 
 Shorty, she so fine 
 I gotta make her mine 
 A ass like that gotta be one of kind 
 I crush 'em every time 
 Punch 'em with every nine 
 I'm fucking with they mind 
 I make 'em press rewind 
 They know they can't shine if I'm around the rhyme 
 Land on paroza's 94, 'cause I commit the crime 
 I send you my line, I did it three3 to nine 
 The D's ran up in my crib 
 You know who dropping dimes 
 You said you a gangster 
 But you neva pop nothin' 
 You said you a wangster 
 And you need to stop frontin' 
 You go to the dealership 
 But you neva cop nothin' 
 You been hustling a long time 
 And you ain't got nothin' 
 You said you a gangster 
 But you neva pop nothin' 
 You said you a wangster 
 And you need to stop frontin' 
 You go to the dealership 
 But you neva cop nothin' 
 You been hustling a long time 
 And you ain't got nothin' 
 Damn Homie, In high school you was the man homie+ 
 What the fuck happened to you 
 I got the sickest vendetta when it come to the cheddar 
 And if you play with my paper, you gonna meet my Berreta 
 Now shorty think I'ma sweat her, sipping on a mereda 
 I'm living once than deta, I know I can do betta 
 She look good but I know she after my cheddar 
 She tryna get in my pockets, homie and I ain't gonna let her 
 Be easy, stop the bullshitting, you get your whole crew wet 
 We in the club doing the same ol' two step 
 Gorilla unit, 'cause they say we bugged out 
 'Cause we don't go nowhere without toast we thugged out 
 You said you a gangster 
 But you neva pop nothin' 
 You said you a wangster 
 And you need to stop frontin' 
 You go to the dealership 
 But you neva cop nothin' 
 You been hustling a long time 
 And you ain't got nothin' 
 You said you a gangster 
 But you neva pop nothin' 
 You said you a wangster 
 And you need to stop frontin' 
 You go to the dealership 
 But you neva cop nothin' 
 You been hustling a long time 
 And you ain't got nothin' 
 Me, I'm no mobster, me, I'm no gangster 
 Me, I'm no hitman me I'm just me, me 
 Me, I'm no wangster, me, I'm no actor 
 But it's me you see on your TV 
 'Cause I hustle, baby, this Spanish shit is so easy 
 I'm getting what you get for a brick to talk greasy 
 By any means, partner, I got to eat on these streets 
 If you play me close, for sure I'm gonna pop my heat 
 Niggas saying they going murph 50 how 
 We riding round with guns the size of little, bow wow 
 What you know about A.K. and A.R.15's 
 Equipped with night vision, shell catchers and dem things, huh 
 You said you a gangster 
 But you neva pop nothin' 
 You said you a wangster 
 And you need to stop frontin' 
 You go to the dealership 
 But you neva cop nothin' 
 You been hustling a long time 
 And you ain't got nothin' 
 Ah hah, damn homie
