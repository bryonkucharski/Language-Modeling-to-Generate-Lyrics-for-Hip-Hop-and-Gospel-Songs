(Intro - 50 Cent - talking, breathing noises in background) 
 Hey pass that nigga, we gettin' high 
 Yo, yo this is some bomb shit right here man 
 50 can't even smoke this motherfucker (ah haha, haha) 
 I can't smoke weed, cause my PO make me piss in a cup 
 Nigga go ahead, disrespect me, I'll fuck you up 
 I ain't talkin' about a fist fight, I'll cut you up 
 Yo don't want stitches in yo grill motherfucker, then chill 
 As a young buck, niggas always knew I puff 
 Yousta see me go to school, on a smoiler bus (woo) 
 I'm a sped ed kid, I'm gettin' all this paper (uh huh) 
 You should sit, scibble lines and see where it take ya 
 Had violent tendencies, so they thought I was dumb 
 Why the so called smart kids was poppin' guns 
 I think about poppin' a gun, and then get the lump sum 
 Grampa my role model, yousta suck on a bottle 
 A pint a Crown Royal, make your insides boil 
 Been smell like Ben Gay, cause his back go out 
 He the one that taught me, what bein' black's about 
 Now peep the roach on the walls, that fall and crawl on my friend's 
 Wrist, Sittin' up in them Benz, to be in the pen 
 In the hood we hit the number, but never the lotto 
 Life in the fast lane, one wheel hit the pothole 
 Let's go, let's flow nigga 
 (Chorus - Singing - 2X) 
 War, what is it good for absolutely nothin' 
 But niggas keep frontin' 
 Fuck a nigga, live like a soldier 
 Die like a soldier 
 (Outro - Talking) 
 War, state of mercy nigga 
 You see me pop off nigga 
 Ain't no peace talk, bitch ass nigga 
 Fake gangsta nigga, you want to seem nigga (yeah) 
 You don't seem nigga, yeah nigga 
 Right? Kayslay, Whoo Kid 
 50 Cent, new shit 
 My nigga Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, G-Unit 
 Niggas, niggas, "Rotten Apple" 
 And nigga shy money, ain't fail nigga 
 Uh huh, ya heard
