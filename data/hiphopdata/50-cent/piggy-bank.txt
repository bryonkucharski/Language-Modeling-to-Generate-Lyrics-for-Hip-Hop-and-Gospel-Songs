50 Cent - Piggy Bank Lyrics 
 (Chorus x2- 50 Cent) 
 Clickity clank clickity clank 
 The money goes into my piggy bank 
 (Bridge- 50 Cent) 
 I'll get atcha, my knife cuts ya skin 
 I'll get atcha, blow shots at ya man 
 I'll get atcha, Tupac don't pretend 
 I'll get atcha, I'll put that to an end 
 (Verse 1- 50 Cent) 
 That shit is oh, don't be screamin' get at me dawg 
 Have you runnin' for ya life when I match ya boy 
 I get to wavin' that semi, like its legal 
 A lil nigga hurt his arm lettin' off that eagle 
 You know me, black on black bentley, big ol' black nine 
 I'll clap your monkey ass, get black on black crime 
 Big ol' chrome rims, clean you know why I shine 
 C'mon man, you know how I shine 
 I'm in the hood, in the drop, Teflon vinyl top 
 Got a hundred guns, a hundred clips, why I don't hear no shots 
 That fat nigga thought Lean Back was "In Da Club" 
 My shit sold 11 mill, his shit was a dud 
 Jada don't fuck with me if you wanna eat 
 'Cause I'll do your lil ass like Jay did Mobb Deep 
 Yeah homie, in New York, niggas like your vocals 
 But that's only New York dawg, your ass is local 
 (Chorus x2- 50 Cent) 
 Clickity clank clickity clank 
 The money goes into my piggy bank 
 (Bridge- 50 Cent) 
 Yeah yeah, get more money, more money 
 Yeah yeah yeah, get more money, more money 
 Yeah yeah yeah, get more money, more money 
 Yeah yeah yeah, get more money, more money 
 Yeah 
 (Verse 2- 50 Cent) 
 Banks shit sells, Buck shit sells, Game shit sells 
 I'm rich as hell, Shyne poppin' off his mouth from a cell 
 He don't want it with me, he in PC 
 I can have a nigga run up on him with a shank 
 For just a few pennies out my piggy bank 
 Yayo, bring the condoms, I'm in room 203 
 Freak bitch look like Kim before the surgeory 
 It's an emergency, a Michael Jackson see 
 Looked at a picture and said she looks like me 
 Kelis said her milkshake brings all the boys to the yard 
 Then Nas went and tattooed the bitch on his arm 
 I mean that way out in Cali, niggas know these guns 
 First thing they say about you, is you a sucker for love 
 This is chess, not checkers, these are warning shots 
 After your next move I'll give you what I got 
 (Chorus x2- 50 Cent) 
 Clickity clank clickity clank 
 The money goes into my piggy bank 
 (Bridge- 50 Cent) 
 Yeah yeah, get more money, more money 
 Yeah yeah yeah, get more money, more money 
 Yeah yeah yeah, get more money, more money 
 Yeah yeah yeah, get more money, more money 
 Yeah 
 (Bridge- 50 Cent) 
 I'll get atcha, I'll punch out your grill 
 I'll get atcha, let off that blue steal 
 I'll get atcha, nigga I'm for real 
 I'll get atcha, you'll get your ass killed 
 (Outro- 50 Cent) 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Y'all niggas gotta do somethin' now man 
 All that shoot 'em up shit y'all be talkin' 
 You gotta do somethin' baby 
 I mean, I mean c'mon man everybody's listenin' 
 Nigga everybody's listenin' 
 I know you ain't gon' just let 50 do you like that 
 I mean damn rep your hood nigga 
 Nigga you hard right? 
 Pop off 
 Yayo get mobs niggas on the phone 
 And tell the niggas I said grip up 
 Niggas got a green light on these monkies
