 Let's rock 'n' roll, baby, lock and load, baby 
 You think I ain't runnin' the show, you got to be crazy 
 I explode on the scene like crack in the '80s 
 Rather catch a slug, then let a nigga play me 
 I'm the don of New York, bow down to your highness 
 Or go against the grain and get moved on with llamas 
 Rappers keep sayin' they bringin' New York back 
 I ain't go no where, I am New York, jack 
 I should buy a plane and write it in the sky 
 50 run this motherfucker, cocksuckers 
 In the back of the Phantom playin' songs from the map 
 With a model bitch bobbin' and weavin' in my lap 
 It's up and down, baby, up and down 
 I like dat, yeah, I like that 
 Anyway, any day, we could play, it's okay 
 We could lay by the bay in L.A., I'll pay 
 Smoke a tray, sniff the yay', she could stay here with me 
 We can catch a matinée or fly away 
 We can go to Vegas, hang out with some of my friends, you know 
 I got some really, really, rich friends, man, real rich friends 
 Floyd Mayweather, the champ, we should go hang out with him 
 You know, the strip clubs or somethin' 
 Now I shouldn't have to tell you, you should know I'm a superstar 
 Now bitch, come grab my bags, be a part of my entourage

 I'm a ghetto star, started out with less than nothin' 
 Got a little money, now I'm on to somethin' 
 You know a special man need a special woman 
 The type before you call, she already comin' 
 You know, the kind to listen when you tellin' her somethin' 
 First sign of a problem, she ain't runnin' 
 Buy her expensive shit, she don't want it 
 Sounds like I wouldn't need a prenup, don't it? Damn 
 Now that, that, that's hot right there, you know what I'm sayin'? 
 Man, I'm feelin' me right now, man, I'm really feelin' me right now 
 Matter of fact, I'm lovin' me right now, you know what I mean? 
 I'd like to just run down to the Justice Of Peace 
 And marry me right now, you know what I mean? 
 This is unbelievably good, man, this is 50 Cent 
 This is back, I'm in rare form 
 The streets is gon' love this, because this is for the streets 
 You know what I mean? 
 I don't get no money off of this, I'm doin' this for fun 
 You know what I mean? Listen 
 This is, this is what I call lovin' man, you understand what I'm sayin'? 
 I wanna just kiss me right now, you know what I mean? 
 Oh baby, oh damn 
 Now I shouldn't have to tell you, you should know I'm a superstar
