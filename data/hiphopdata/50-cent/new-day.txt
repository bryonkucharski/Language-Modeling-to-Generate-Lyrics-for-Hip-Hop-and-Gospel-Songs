It don't take much strength to pull a trigger 
 But try to get up every morning day after day and work for a living 
 Let's see 'em try that 
 Then we'll see who's the real tough guy 
 The working man is a tough guy 
 Party people say, party people say 
 Ay, it's a new day, it's a new day 
 World is getting ready, everybody ready, yeah 
 For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say 
 A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ay 
 A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ay 
 A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ay 
 A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ay 
 I woke up this morning thinking 'bout the old me 
 When I was feeling like, Miller Lite and Old E 
 But now I ride on some conscious shit 
 I'm getting bread while I toast to my accomplishments 
 Only one I can have a problem with is myself 
 It's probably why my only competition is myself 
 From today to the morning, the Doctor just rock to the same drum 
 Fuck the past though I ain't forgot where I came from 
 Uh, I got the club rocking 
 Uh, I got your girl jocking 
 Uh, me and Fif' still in this bitch 
 We going the distance with you party people, come on 
 Party people say, party people say 
 Ay, it's a new day, it's a new day 
 World is getting ready, everybody ready, yeah 
 For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say 
 A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ay 
 A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ay 
 A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ay 
 A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ay 
 Yeah, now you can get your knees on the church floor break it better 
 Or push the door on the liquor store, see where it get ya 
 But me I got to be on top, I said me I get to be on top 
 I got the street on lock 
 I'm on automatic pilot, ain't nobody starting me 
 Growing up in poverty ain't filled my heart with larceny 
 Niggas ride out on high, I jump to get 'em off of me 
 I'm a leader, look and see the natural-born boss of me 
 They from Bel Air, I'm from the bottom, 
 Soon as I spot 'em, I get to drop 'em, I got 'em I cock my piece and red dot 'em 
 It's dinner time when the 9 come out 
 It's off with chain, off with the ring, move bang, off with ya brain now 
 Party people say, party people say 
 Ay, it's a new day, it's a new day 
 World is getting ready, everybody ready, yeah 
 For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say 
 A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ay 
 A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ay 
 A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ay 
 A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ay 
 Marks on the wall 
 It's now or never at all 
 I'm gonna give it my all, oh oooh 
 Whether I rise or fall, oh oooh 
 True story, I said I'd get rich or die trying 
 I did it, good luck sucker, try'na stop my shine 
 Nothing matters but the music, music my first love 
 We paper chasing, I'm always coming in first 'cause 
 I'm built for it, see I'm better under pressure 
 I react like a maniac when I'm coming to get ya 
 I got to win, Em' watching and Dre watching and my son watching 
 Fuck that, losing ain't an option 
 I'm sharp I'm on point, the ink from my ballpoint 
 Throwing out my pain, I'm back on my A-game 
 I'm focused, for me this is just another victory 
 Except that I'm stronger than an ox now mentally 
 Party people say, party people say 
 Ay, it's a new day, it's a new day 
 World is getting ready, everybody ready, yeah 
 For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say 
 A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ay 
 A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ay 
 A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ay 
 A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ay
