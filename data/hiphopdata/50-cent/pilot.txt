Me, I'm like a pilot, G5 Jet I'm fly as shit 
 You cannot deny it, oh no, no-no, no-no 
 Bitches be on my dick, designer threads, I'm fly as shit 
 You cannot deny it, oh no, no-no, no-no 
 Better back up off me, bitch watch me ball (ball) 
 Better back up off me, bitch watch me ball (ball) 
 Better back up off me, bitch watch me ball (ball) 
 Better back up off me, bitch watch me ball (ball) 
 Nigga every law and every rule I break 
 Feds tryna watch the moves I make 
 Every day I get birthday cake 
 There's a hundred racks there in that safe 
 Hundred grands there on that plate 
 I ain't thinkin' 'bout catchin' no case 
 Nigga my safe house super safe 
 I zip Giuseppe's, I don't tie no lace 
 Tom Ford, Y-S-L, nigga, run and tell 
 I'm fly as hell 
 Big Bentley, Mulsanne 
 No LP, just two songs 
 A-side, B-side 
 Rider gang, bitch, that's right 
 From N.O. to N.Y 
 I got shooters bitch, don't act cute and shit 
 We was born broke, no silver spoon 
 My niggas strapped, they super goons 
 These niggas here kinda soft 
 We get the bread, then fuck it off 
 Get more money, then fuck it off 
 Make your bitch wan' suck me off 
 We ain't had shit, we learned to ball 
 Them ghetto bitches they love us all 
 Me, I'm like a pilot, G5 Jet I'm fly as shit 
 You cannot deny it, oh no, no-no, no-no 
 Bitches be on my dick, designer threads, I'm fly as shit 
 You cannot deny it, oh no, no-no, no-no 
 Better back up off me, bitch watch me ball (ball) 
 Better back up off me, bitch watch me ball (ball) 
 Better back up off me, bitch watch me ball (ball) 
 Better back up off me, bitch watch me ball (ball) 
 Shorty bounce it, and she clap that 
 Slide down the pole, she's a super ho 
 That gold cuban, I jack that 
 You niggas know how this s'posed to go 
 I'm in the club with niggas, I clap that 
 That P90 I pack that 
 Your fuckin' head, I crack that 
 You wan' test me? Don't test me 
 Look, lover boy what're you trippin' for? 
 Niggas don't even want your ho 
 My nigga Ill fresh out the pen 
 You gonna make him go back again 
 Them bottles coming, we turnt up 
 Them sparks burnin' now watch us shine 
 You do this shit once a year 
 We do this shit all the time 
 Now captain come and save her 
 Get her from around this paper 
 She'll never be the same 
 I mean like everything will change 
 She cute blow a little cheese on her 
 Get her ass shots, throw D's on her 
 Them shoes more than you think though 
 My bitch look like my bank roll 
 Me, I'm like a pilot, G5 Jet I'm fly as shit 
 You cannot deny it, oh no, no-no, no-no 
 Bitches be on my dick, designer threads, I'm fly as shit 
 You cannot deny it, oh no, no-no, no-no 
 Better back up off me, bitch watch me ball (ball)
