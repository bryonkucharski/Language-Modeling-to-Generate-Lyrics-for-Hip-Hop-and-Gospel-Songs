Adam: 
 My life, my life 
 Makes me wanna run away 
 There's no place to go 
 No place to go 
 All the confusion 
 It's an illusion like a movie 
 Got nowhere to go 
 Nowhere to run and hide 
 No matter how hard I try 
 50 Cent: 
 Yeah, 03, I went from back filthy to filthy rich 
 Man, the emotions change so I can never trust a bitch 
 I tried to help niggas get on, they turned around and spit 
 Right in my face, so Game and Buck, both can suck a dick 
 Now when you hear 'em it may sound like it's some other shit 
 'Cause I'm not writing anymore, they not making hits 
 I'm far from perfect, there's so many lessons I done learned 
 If money is evil look at all the evil I done earned 
 I'm doing what I'm supposed to, I'm a writer, I'm a fighter 
 Entrepeneur, fresh out the sewer, watch me maneuver 
 What's it to ya? The track I lace it, it's better than basic 
 This is my recovery, my comeback, kid 
 Adam: 
 My life, my life 
 Makes me wanna run away 
 There's no place to go 
 No place to go 
 All the confusion 
 It's an illusion like a movie 
 Got nowhere to go 
 Nowhere to run and hide 
 No matter how hard I try 
 Eminem: 
 While you were sipping your own Kool-Aid getting your buzz heavy 
 I was in the fucking sheds sharpening my machete 
 Sipping some of of that revenge juice, getting my taste buds ready 
 To wolf down this spaghetti, or should I say this spaghett-even? 
 I think you fucking meatballs keep on just forgetting 
 Thought he was finished, motherfucker, it's only the beginning 
 He's buggin' again, he's straight thuggin', fuck who he's offending 
 He'll rip your vocal chords out and have them bitches plugged in the 
 Motherfucking wall with 3000 volts of electricity 
 Now take the other end, dump them, then plug them, motherfuckers in each 
 One of your eye sockets 'cause I thought you might finally fucking see 
 That'll teach you to go voicing your cocksuckin' opinion to me 
 I done put my blood, my sweat and my tears in this shit 
 Fuck letting up, you're gonna end up regretting you ever betted against me 
 Feels like I'mma snap any minute, yeah, it's happening again 
 I'm thinking about the same 
 Mother fuck everybody that's up in this bitch, but 50! 
 Cause this is all I know, this is why so hard I go 
 I swear to God I put my heart and soul into this more than anybody knows 
 I'm trapped, so all I do is rap, but every time I rap I'm more trapped 
 And I rap myself right into this bubble, oh oh, I guess it's bubble wrap 
 This is like a vicious cycle, my life's in a crisis 
 Christ, how was I supposed to know shit would turn up like it did? 
 Feels like I'm going psycho again 
 And I might just blow my lid 
 Shit, I almost wish that I would have never made Recovery, kid 
 'Cause I'm running in circles with 
 Adam: 
 My life, my life

 There's no place to go 
 No place to go 
 All the confusion 
 It's an illusion like a movie 
 Got nowhere to go 
 Nowhere to run and hide

 50 Cent: 
 I haven't been this fucking confused since I was a kid 
 Sold like 40 million records, people forgot what I did 
 Maybe this is for me, maybe 
 Maybe I'm supposed to go crazy 
 Maybe I'll do it 3 AM in the morning like Shady 
 Psycho killer, Michael Myers, I'm on fire like a lighter 
 Tryna say the same classic, get your ass kicked mad quick 
 Wrap your head up in plastic, pussy 
 Now pick the casket, dirt nap with the maggots 
 It's tragic, it's sad it's 
 Never gonna end, now we number one again 
 With that frown on your face, and your heart full of hate 
 Accept it, respect it 
 This a gift, God-given, like the air in the lungs 
 Of every fucking thing livin' 
 Adam:

 All the confusion
