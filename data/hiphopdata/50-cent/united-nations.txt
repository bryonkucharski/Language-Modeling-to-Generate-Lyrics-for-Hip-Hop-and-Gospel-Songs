Ah, I got big bags of paper I'ma spend, ah 
 We gonn do it how we do it, 
 Then do the shit again 
 You should fuck with a winner bitch if you wanna win, ah 
 We're celebrating like a nigga home fresher out the pen, ah 
 I'm on, bitches all on my john 
 To get bread and don't blow bread, the fuck is the point 
 Call me Elroy, I be on some Jetson shit 
 Papa X and the blue pill will wreck a bitch 
 I like it raw, uh baby, uh baby, I like it raw 
 Take a chill pill break in early tomorrow 
 The morning after, plan b, no kids involved 
 Please no kids involved 
 I put that money in the vault bitch Usain Bolt 
 Progress... make a deal then blow mills for real 
 Time's a wasting, you watching my watch, ha 
 You old school, huh, jocking my style 
 Ah, I got big bags of paper I'ma spend, ah 
 We gonn do it how we do it, 
 Then do the shit again 
 You should fuck with a winner bitch if you wanna win, ah 
 We're celebrating like a nigga home fresher out the pen, ah 
 I don't give a flying fuck, I always make bail 
 Motherfucker on the wall, check Forbes, I'm there 
 Not once, every year 
 Even when I take a break, my pockets is in shape 
 I'm back off a vacation 
 Can you believe it, I been getting paid on vacation 
 Yeah, I'ma keep niggas forever hating 
 They thought I'm going down, 
 Now look, I'm levitating 
 I'm a D pac, meditating, 
 On some Molly and ... united nations 
 Fond in the world, food program 
 Fin to solve world hunger, god damn 
 Ah, I got big bags of paper I'ma spend, ah 
 We gonn do it how we do it, 
 Then do the shit again 
 You should fuck with a winner bitch if you wanna win, ah 
 We're celebrating like a nigga home fresher out the pen, ah.
