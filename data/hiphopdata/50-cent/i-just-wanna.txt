Look nigga, if you don't love yourself 
 Ain't nobody gon' love you 
 Your shit ain't right 
 What bitch in her right mind gon' fuck you 
 That's what they told me then 
 So I was like "fuck a bitch" 
 Imma grind, Imma shine, every time blow they mind 
 Oh now she like me, oh oh oh now they like me 
 All I want is a blow job 
 This bitch wanna be wifey 
 No 3-course meal, all I want is fast food 
 I wanna have fun, how about a cookie huh? 
 I don't wanna love you 
 I just wanna unbutton your blouse and let the girls out 
 I wanna fuck you 
 Maybe later on, if you're free you can come to my house 
 Only if you want to 
 We can get freakier and freakier than you've ever been, 
 If you want to 
 We can get freakier and freakier you can bring a friend 
 Bitches from Belize, keep all in the weed 
 Remy crew got me sweating out a remi weave 
 Fuck a model tonight, my bitch is from the P's 
 She the project dick tease 
 Them hood bitches always bring back memories 
 They all catch the makers like "Yayo you remember me?" 
 I certainly do, pull the curtain on a '62 
 Hands was free, she on her menstrual 
 I promise I don't love em, I don't cuff 'em 
 I don't pay a bitch's rent to have the next nigga fuckin' 
 I'm a pimp with principles 
 Killin' with visuals my diamonds like two ? bitch 
 I don't wanna love you 
 I just wanna unbutton your blouse and let the girls out 
 I wanna fuck you 
 Maybe later on, if you're free you can come to my house 
 Only if you want to 
 We can get freakier and freakier than you've ever been, 
 If you want to 
 We can get freakier and freakier you can bring a friend 
 I don't want a relationship, I just wanna have fun 
 In every position, we can come up with till we're done 
 And my request is to be kickin' shit in my ear 
 Like to hear what you're thinking, after laughing and drinking 
 We can have a ball, we can do it all 
 Moonshine light up the sky at night time 
 With me any time could be the right time 
 I'm sort of impulsive, I'm kinda explosive 
 Me, take a little at a time in doses 
 Don't want you addicted, I just wanna kick it 
 You could pick the spot, I'll be there with the quickness 
 Give it to you good, when I'm gone I'm sure you gon' miss this 
 I don't wanna love you 
 I just wanna unbutton your blouse and let the girls out 
 I wanna fuck you 
 Maybe later on, if you're free you can come to my house 
 Only if you want to 
 We can get freakier and freakier than you've ever been, 
 If you want to 
 We can get freakier and freakier you can bring a friend
