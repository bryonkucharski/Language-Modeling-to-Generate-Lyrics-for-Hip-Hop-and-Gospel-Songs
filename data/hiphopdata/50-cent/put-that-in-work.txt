It's a natural progression first you cut a nigga than you gun butt a nigga then you pull the trigga put that work in put that work in make it hot or die down do that shit again. 
 You know aunt killed my dog and never said sorry 
 Niggas broke in my crib and they stole my atari 
 Man niggas coulda asked I woulda let 'em hold a cartridge 
 I wasn't fuckin' wit nobody see how niggas start shit 
 Startin sellin crack I coulda been tiger woods but they ain't got no fuckin' golf courses in the hood 
 I said I'm sellin dope I don't regret shit 
 I'm sellin dope nigga that good shit 
 I was supposed to be a A student a valedictorian 
 Instead I'm in special Ed tryna fuck? 
 They didn't like my style they said they didn't like my style 
 Them same bitches want me now 
 In came the cash out with the cocaine 
 Virgin Mary medallion hangin' off my rope chain 
 Four finga ring nigga doin' his thing 
 You get a couple bitches after you get the bling
