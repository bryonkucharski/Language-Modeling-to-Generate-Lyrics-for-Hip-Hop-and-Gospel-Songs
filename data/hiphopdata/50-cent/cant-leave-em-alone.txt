I'm focused, man 
 You should know this, man 
 Yes, one dose of me will have you addicted 
 To know me is to love me; I handle my business 
 Any city, any town; touch down, I do my thing 
 I'm a hustler, baby; I provide by any means 
 I'm a great conversationalist; you should know what I'm about 
 When you look at me, baby, you should see a way out 
 Out the hood, out the drama, out the Bentley that's on 
 Out the headache and stress you done been through before 
 It's only been three months and I already got it bad 
 So hood that I keep on comin' back 
 My girlfriends telling me I don't know how to act 
 But I'm tellin' them, baby, bye, fall back 
 He's so good, and he knows how to love me 
 But so hood, and he's so heavy in the streets 
 He's my dude, and you better get used to things 
 And I don't care what you say about me 
 They say: 
 That he does it with the best, runs it in the west 
 Padding on his chest (uh-huh) 
 I like it (so what), I like it 
 And they say (that he's gonna hurt me) 
 Just wait and see (but they don't know me) 
 'Cause I am what he wants, his girl and I love it 
 I can't leave him alone 
 I tried that good boy game 
 But the dope boys turning me on 
 It's just that he know what I want 
 So bad, I love that; I can't leave him alone 
 I can't leave him alone 
 I tried that game 
 But the dope boys turning me on 
 It's just that he know what I want 
 So bad, I love that; I can't leave him alone 
 So when I had a good guy, he didn't do that much for me 
 Tried to be hard but that he could never be 
 Always tell me that no one could compare to me 
 But couldn't matter when other guy was starin' at me 
 Now the time plays back so everyone could look at me 
 From the A to hill up in Beverly 
 He's so fly that he knows how to carry me 
 First class, when they talk, we don't hear what they say 
 That he does it with the best, runs it in the west 
 Padding on his chest (uh-huh) 
 I like it (so what), I like it 
 And they say (that he's gonna hurt me) 
 Just wait and see (but they don't know me) 
 'Cause I am what he wants, his girl and I love it 
 The more I get, the more my ambition tells there's more 
 I'll move a A for that girl, I'll move ahead on that boy 
 Then I flip that (double up) kick back (cuddle up) 
 Ya friends try to confuse, but you know what 
 My intentions are good; I can't help it I'm hood 
 I wouldn't change if I could; you shouldn't tell me I should 
 Baby, you should take me as I am 
 And be happy you're my girl 'cause I'm happy I'm ya man 
 I can hear your call; it just takes one call 
 I'll come running, boy; I promise I will be there for you 
 All my heart, it belongs to you 
 I can't lose you, boy; I just can't leave you alone 
 (Chorus:Repeat x2)
