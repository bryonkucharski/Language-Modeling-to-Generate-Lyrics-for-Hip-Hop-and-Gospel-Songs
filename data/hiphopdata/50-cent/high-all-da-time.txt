I don't need Don Perignon I don't need Cris 
 Tangaray and Alize I don't need shit 
 Nigga I'm high all the time I smoke that good shit 
 I stay high all the time and I'm on some hood shit 
 Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate 
 Give me a dutch and a lighter I spark shit 
 I stay high all the time, I smoke that good shit 
 I'm high all the time and I'm on some hood shit 
 Everytime I roll up, niggas I holla roll up 
 Then I tell 'em hold up 
 You ain't needing money you ain't smoking in my benzo 
 20 inch Lorenzo, smoking on indo 
 High as a motherfucker, I be on the backstreets 
 Niggas know I clap heat 
 Homie if you got beef, man you betta holla at me 
 Niggas get locked up, stabbed up, shot up 
 Everytime I pop up a lot going on in my hood 
 I shoot the dice and holla "get 'em girls" 
 Daddy need new shoes 
 Daddy need Pirellis to look mean on 22s 
 Stash spots, X-Box, Lab top fax machine phone 
 Bulletproof this bitch and I'm gone 
 2003 Suburban swerving, too many sips of Henny 
 The D said they searched the weapon they can't find the semis 
 They was just harassing me 'cause they knew who I was 
 Spent the night in central booking for smoking some buds 
 Now if you heard now I'da started some shit 
 It ain't because I be high, I be high, I be high 
 And if you heard I'd done let off a clip 
 It ain't because I be high, I be high 
 But I twist that, la la la la 
 I get high as I wanna nigga, go against me for sure yousa gonner nigga 
 I don't smoke to calm my nerves but I got beef 
 Fit to crush my enemies like I crush the ass cheeks 
 If you love me tell me you love me, don't stab me man 
 I hate to be in the pens for clappin one of my fans 
 Now let me show you how to greet me when you meet me 
 When you see me, if you real my nigga 
 You know how to holla "G-UNIT" 
 There's no competition, there's just me 
 50 cent muthafucka I'm hot on these streets 
 If David could go against goliath with a stone 
 I could go at Nas and Jigga both for the throne 
 Now who you know besides me who write lines and squeeze 9s 
 And have hoes in the hood sniffin on white lines 
 You don't want me to be your kid's role model 
 I teach 'em how to buck them 380s and load up them hollows 
 Have shorty freshin for stoop, ready to shoot 
 Big blunt in his mouth, duce duce in his boot 
 Sit in the crib, sipping Guinness 
 Watching menace then o lord 
 Have a young nigga buckin shit like he old dawg 
 My team they depend on me when its crunch time 
 I eat a nigga food in broad day like its lunch time 
 You feeling brave nigga go ahead, get gully 
 See if I'ma leave your brains leaking up out your skully 
 I'd done made myself hot so ain't shit you can tell me 
 Now niggas calling me the feature man, fuck your money 
 I ain't hurting I'm aight, nigga I'm doing good 
 I ain't got to write rhymes I got bricks in the hood
