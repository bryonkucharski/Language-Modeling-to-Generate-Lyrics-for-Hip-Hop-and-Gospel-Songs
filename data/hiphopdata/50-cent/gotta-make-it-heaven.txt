I gotta make it to Heaven, for goin' through hell 
 I gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven 
 I gotta make it to Heaven, for goin' through hell 
 I gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven 
 Some say, I'm paranoid, I say, I'm careful how I choose my friends 
 I been to I.C.U. once I ain't going again 
 First Zee got murked, then Roy got murked 
 And homies still in the hood, why he ain't gettin' hurt? 
 I smell somethin' fishy man it might be a rat 
 Damn niggaz switchin' sides on niggaz just like that 
 You know me, I stay wit a bitch on her knees 
 And get guns away in the hood like government cheese 
 Spray off Suzuki's eleven hundred cc's 
 More plate on the back, straight squeezin' a Mak 
 In the hood they identify niggaz by they cars 
 So I switch off bass to stay off the radar 
 I ain't gotta be around to make shit hot 
 I send Yayo to dump 30 shots on ya block 
 So spray dat Tec nigga if I say get it done 
 An make it wet niggaz if you 'round me son 
 I gotta make it to Heaven, for goin' through hell 
 I gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven 
 I gotta make it to Heaven, for goin' through hell 
 I gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven 
 I gotta make it to Heaven, for goin' through hell 
 I gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven 
 I gotta make it to Heaven, for goin' through hell 
 I gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven 
 When I come through the hood, I don't stop to rap the niggaz 
 Get close enough to smack, get it clappin' nigga 
 Pac tried to front so I waved the chrome on his ass 
 Point Blank range, I spat put a bone on his ass 
 Two weeks later niggaz came through with Maks to lay me down 
 Then sprayed, I played dead the got the fuck off the ground 
 Out the blue, I get a phone call 50 waddup? 
 They sent a bitch at me I send the bitch back cut up 
 I don't play that pussy shit, I done told you boy 
 Front on me, you gon meet one of my soldiers boy 
 'Cause Antwed shot up his mamma crib an now he in jail 
 Trippin' on Fliks an bogger trail, pussy in black tail 
 Pac mamma moved but she don't talk to him no more 
 The shells from twains 4-4, blew the hinge off her door 
 Without that check every month, how she gon pay for the crib 
 Man social service finis' come an' take dem kids 
 I gotta make it to Heaven, for goin' through hell 
 I gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven 
 I gotta make it to Heaven, for goin' through hell 
 I gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven 
 I gotta make it to Heaven, for goin' through hell 
 I gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven 
 I gotta make it to Heaven, for goin' through hell 
 I gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven 
 Lord, grant me the serenity to accept the things, I cannot change 
 The courage to change the things I can and wisdom know the difference 
 But A, Ade did a make you say dat 
 That's the pray they burn in ya head when you a case act 
 Man I might talk to you while we up in them pens 
 But when we come home, dat don't mean we gon fuck an be friends 
 Shells smash ya head close enough to hear 'em whistlin' 
 Thank God they missed you, an' go grab ya pistol 
 In the hood niggaz runnin' 'round actin' crazy 
 Buyin' little air Jordan's for maybe babies 
 See it might be his an' it might be yours 
 'Cause them broads in the projects is straight up whores 
 Man it don't take much for you to get in them drawers 
 You ain't can have 'em on they back or on all fours 
 You ain't got to tell me, you feelin' this shit 
 Because I hear what I'm sayin', I know I'm killin' this shit 
 I gotta make it to Heaven, for goin' through hell 
 I gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven 
 I gotta make it to Heaven, for goin' through hell 
 I gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven 
 I gotta make it to Heaven, for goin' through hell 
 I gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven 
 I gotta make it to Heaven, for goin' through hell 
 I gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven
