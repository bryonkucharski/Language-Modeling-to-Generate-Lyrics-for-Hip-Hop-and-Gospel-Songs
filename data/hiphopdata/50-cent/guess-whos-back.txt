Guess who's biz-ack it's not beanie Siegal or J-Hov 
 It's 50 Cent ya niggas should know 
 Don't make me relapse 
 Run up on yo' ass with the 4 
 You punk nigga I done told you before 
 Fuck being in a cage "man that shit's for the birds" 
 I do my dirt in the hood but I live in the burbs 
 When ya talk be careful how you choose your words 
 Cause send niggas to put ya fuckin' brains on the curb 
 Am I my brothers keeper? "Yes I am" 
 You know to get low, you see that gun in my hand 
 G-UNIT! Don't go fuckin' with my soldiers Boy 
 I leave you laid out I'ma say "I told you boy" 
 You rollin' with twenty niggas, you rollin' with twenty guns 
 Sixteen hollows in loaded in every one 
 I know you slow so I do the math 
 That's 320 shells lying at your ass (HA!) 
 You spend alot of time talkin' bout how you ball out 
 When you get hit you gon' run and bleed to you fall out 
 I guess you didn't think we was down to go all out 
 Once again you was wrong 
 You ain't on the shit we on 
 My money gettin' long 
 Now my team gettin' strong 
 I'm gone!
