My Gun 
 (50 Cent) 
 (Gunshots and Tire Screeching) 
 Nigga, my gun go off 
 You see the barrell turnin' 
 You feel the hollows burnin' 
 Nigga now you learnin' 
 Nigga, my gun go off 
 Call it attempted murder 
 Nigga I'm tryin' to merk ya, 
 When I come back bustin' 
 Nigga, my gun go off 
 Don't try to say I'm trippin' 
 When I get to flippin' 
 Then I smack the clip in, 
 Nigga, my gun go off 
 We call it putting work in, 
 Leavin' niggas hurtin', 
 Homocide's learkin' 
 My gun go off 
 Fuck Boy you can see it to believe it 
 Tryna dodge and wave it end up a parapelegic 
 Believe me its easy 
 I'll hurt you, I'll merk you, I'll pop summin' 
 Drop summin', I ain't gonna stop hunting 
 Run run till you're spun 
 One shot One gun 
 One-9... 
 1-1 emergency, 
 It's murder, B 
 It's excellent execution when I'm pulling the trigger 
 No mistake for that cake 
 I'm hittin you and your niggas 
 Feel the flame when I aim, 
 For the top of your brain 
 See the spark and the bang, 
 Nigga shit ain't a game 
 Do the math or get blast 
 Bullets go through the glass 
 Go through your ass fast 
 And the leather seat sittin' Ave. 
 It's not a war when there's casualties on one side 
 I ride 
 Turn it up on you niggas after Jay ride by 
 I click-clack that's that I don't flash, I mash 
 I wave the Uzi at em, 
 I make a movie out em. 
 Nigga, my gun go off 
 You see the barrell turnin' 
 You feel the hollows burnin' 
 Nigga now you learnin' 
 Nigga, my gun go off 
 Call it attempted murder 
 Nigga I'm tryin' to merk ya, 
 When I come back bustin' 
 Nigga, my gun go off 
 Don't try to say I'm trippin' 
 When I get to flippin' 
 Then I smack the clip in, 
 Nigga, my gun go off 
 We call it putting work in, 
 Leavin' niggas hurtin', 
 Homocide's learkin' 
 My gun go off 
 You better lose yourself in the moment 
 Use it, Fuck the music I'ma let it go 
 You only get one shot before I back out and fire back 
 At ya hat, ya back, ya ass crack, ya nutsack. 
 Your caddilac if you make it to that, 
 I'm hitting that 
 The 70's was smack 
 The 80's crack. 
 The 90's was grimey 
 Millennium mac man 
 Clips on the whips I ride in em 
 Bad bitches I ride inn em 
 Don't worry I'll get 'em 
 Gat Jammed or un-jammed 
 God dam Safest the safety don't work 
 Squeeze the eagle, it chirp. 
 End up faced down in the dirt 
 More than hurt, 
 Bring the beef where you hang out, 
 Bang out, 
 Shots ring out. 
 Hit your shoulders tryin' to blow your brains out. 
 Hit your homies in their legs, 
 Bet they have their canes out tomorrow 
 You know tomorrow's just a day away, 
 If you can keep your heart beatin' then your ass awake. 
 Nigga, my gun go off
