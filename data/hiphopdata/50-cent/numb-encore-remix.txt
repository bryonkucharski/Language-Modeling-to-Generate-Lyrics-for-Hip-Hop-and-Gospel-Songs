*Featuring Linkin Park 
 50 Cent: 
 Sh-sh-sh-shady 
 Aftermath, haha 
 G-G-G-G-G-Unit!, haha 
 Jay-Z & Linkin Park: 
 I've become so numb 
 Can I get an encore, 
 Do you want more (more...) [x3] 
 Eminem: 
 Get your ass up for the doctor 
 One more time, get your ass up for the doctor 
 Come on now, here we go 
 Cliff hanger, it's another club banger 
 Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat 
 Get on down 
 Dr. Dre: 
 Times up, games over, you lose, I win 
 'Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here 
 Ooh yeah, new year, next phase, begin 
 Look who's got you goin' crazy again 
 I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in 
 I go out and just come back full circle again 
 You a fad, that means your something that we already had 
 But once you're gone, you don't come back, too bad 
 Eminem: 
 You're off the map now, radar can't even find you 
 We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you 
 You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you 
 We walk around just playin' the violin behind you 
 Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and bitchin' 
 Sit and observe, listen, you'll learn if you pay attention 
 Why ten multi-platinum albums later, three diamond 
 World-wide, we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbin' 
 (Chorus: Jay-Z & Linkin Park) 
 Now can I get an encore, do you want more 
 Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy 
 So for one last time I need y'all to roar 
 Now what the hell are you waitin for 
 After me, there shall be no more 
 So for one last time, nigga make some noise 
 (Brigde: Eminem) 
 So all my people on the left, all my people on the right 
 Scream one last time 
 Eminem: 
 When dr. dre say crunk, you will get it crunk, get it crunk 
 Crunk, crunk, crunk 
 And when 50 cent says jump, you get on one foot and jump 
 Jump, jump, jump, jump 
 Dr. Dre: 
 The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it 
 I don't gotta promote it for you to know that doc is off the benches 
 Eminem: 
 We keep the party rockin' off the henges 
 We ain't showin' off, we just goin' off popular consensus 
 Dr. Dre: 
 But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk 
 Doc is all washed up, knock it off 
 Who the fuck is Doc impressin'? 
 Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression 
 You must be on the cock of Doc, cause Doc left you all guessin' 
 So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (what) 
 We gon' have this mutherfucker hoppin' in a second (bump bump) 
 That's why we always save the best cut last 
 To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass 
 Eminem: 
 'Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestle with alligators 
 Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers 
 Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap 
 Maybe raised to be racist 
 Who may have never got to see our faces 
 Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages 
 Broke down barriers of language and races 
 Just call on the cape crusaders 
 And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic 
 And we can play the back and forth all day 
 Like the hot potato game, that's why we came to 
 (Bridge: Eminem) 
 First we came here to set this party off right 
 Let's bounce tonight 
 Now what the hell are you waitin for 
 After me, there shall be no more 
 So for one last time, nigga make some noise 
 I've become so numb 
 So for one last time I need y'all to roar 
 One last time I need y'all to roar 
 Linkin Park: 
 Every step that I take is another mistake to you 
 (Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow) 
 And every second I waste is more than I can take 
 (Chorus: Linkin Park and Jay-Z) 
 I've become so numb I can't feel you there 
 I've become so tired so much more aware 
 I'm becoming this all I want to do 
 Is be more like me and be less like you 
 I've become so numb 
 Can I get an encore, do you want more (more...) 
 50 Cent: 
 Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do 
 We make the club jump everywhere we go 
 It's no secret, everybody know 
 When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved 
 Dr. Dre: 
 And plenty honey's involved, the sunny Sunday's and palm trees 
 Cali, everyday it's just another party from the valley's 
 All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally 
 Eminem: 
 Hands up for the grand finale 
 Now raise up out your seat, Dre is about to speak 
 Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week 
 Dr. Dre: 
 You could catch me in the studio bangin' out the beats to 
 Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker 
 Eminem: 
 So never say never cause Shady Aftermath together 
 Along with G-Unit Records presents the return of the-the Doc (and Shady) 
 No one could do it better 
 We tear the club up and leave without a strand of evidence and uh 
 (Chorus: Jay-Z & Linkin Park) 
 Now can I get an encore, do you want more 
 Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy 
 So for one last time I need y'all to roar 
 I've become so numb 
 So for one last time I need y'all to roar 
 One last time I need y'all to roar
