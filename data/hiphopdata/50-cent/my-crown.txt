They can't keep a good man down 
 Always keep a smile when they want me to frown 
 Keep the vibes and I stood my grounds 
 They will never ever take my crown, nah 
 They will never ever take my crown, nah 
 They will never ever take my crown, nah 
 I'm still shit, I meet y'all ready 
 Fuck around will be reading your obituary 
 My whip clean, my watch gleam 
 9 karats hoe, that's what I call a pinky ring 
 Don't even trick, my heart cold 
 I'm round the globe, I'm on parole 
 I ball hard, I go hard 
 They say I'm grimy, up to no good 
 Oh god 
 Shawty work that, we should work that 
 She a canna, she damn close to perfect 
 I might want stunt, throw a hunned racks 
 Get my man strapped, he gonn get my money back 
 I'm ghetto right, I'm super hood 
 I'm shitting on these niggas like they knew I would 
 I'm ghetto right, I'm super hood 
 I'm shitting on these niggas like they knew I would 
 Who Jah bless I say no man curse 
 Things get better when they thought it would be worst 
 Here comes the officer asking for ah search 
 They found no weapons just only a draw first 
 They found no weapons just only a draw first 
 They found no weapons just only a draw first 
 Gram after gram, time after time 
 I got the grind 
 I can't help it, I gotta shine 
 I do it big, you stupid big 
 I could fit like half the projects in my crib 
 You stick around, I'm outta here 
 You on the ground, I'm in the lear 
 I love yachts, a 9 boats 
 Either way, come a nigga got you picking dough 
 They done made me mad, now I'm in my bad 
 And I'm back with the strap catch a case be the case 
 Rich nigga swag 
 Every step I take, every lil itsy bitsy move I make 
 Turn the big bags a birthday cake 
 I can even fit this shit in my safe 
 Wait! 
 Got more money coming, try not to hate 
 Why you think a nigga in and out a state? 
 I'm a pro, I'ma go when I operate 
 I get the bread, I blow the bread 
 I'm flashing, I'm shining 
 I get the bread, I blow the bread 
 My bitches, my diamonds 
 Who Jah bless I say no man curse 
 Things get better when they thought it would be worst 
 Here comes the officer asking for ah search 
 They found no weapons just only a draw first 
 They found no weapons just only a draw first 
 They found no weapons just only a draw first.
