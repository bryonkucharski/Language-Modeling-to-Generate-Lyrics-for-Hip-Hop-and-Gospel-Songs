Gee wilikers Gatman they got me surrounded 
 (50 Cent) 
 I'm on my way 
 (Chorus - 50 Cent) 
 I got a gatman 
 There's a problem I'm a solve it 
 A nigga movin' around 
 With a big ass revolver and I'm back, man 
 What the fuck are you retarded 
 You touch Shady I'll leave you dearly departed 
 (Verse 1- 50 Cent) 
 Robin, Cagney or Lacey, it's 50 cent and Shady 
 The worst baby, put your hands on my peoples 
 I'll react crazy, put a hole through ya front and ya back maybe 
 But dude if you try me, I'll have your ass hooked up to an IV 
 I'll leave no witnesses when I ride, B 
 You fuck with me, you see 
 I react like an animal, and tear you apart 
 If the masterpiece was murder, I'd major in art. 
 Niggas knew I wasn't wrapped too tight from start 
 But bein' a little off, landed me on top of the charts (whoo) 
 So you take the good with the bad, I guess 
 Level three Teflon plate on my chest 
 And my cock back hollow tip in the chamber 
 Will daint ya, anger will change ya 
 And make ya aim there and squeeze 
 (Chorus 50 Cent) 
 I got a gat man 
 There's a problem I'm a solve it 
 A nigga movin' around 
 With a big ass revolver and I'm back, man [x2] 
 (Verse 2 - 50 Cent) 
 Nigga you get it twisted, you can get ya wig splitted 
 I don't give a fuck, I don't care if police know I did it 
 Man I hustle, I get money, in the sunshine or a blizzard 
 I go hard for that paper, homie I just gotta get it 
 Got a money scheme I'm plottin in the county and I'm with it 
 You cross me and you gon' make a cemetery visit 
 That's gangsta, you know me I told it, 'cause I live it 
 Shellcases drop, when that chopper chop 
 Way up the block, get hit with copper tops 
 When drama pop, the llama pop 
 And it won't stop, you can run, call the cops 
 This ain't new, niggas know how I be on it 
 That shit you got, put my pistol to you I want it 
 It's not a game, perfect aim, you feel the flame 
 Up against ya brain, man it's so hot I'll make ya wish it rained 
 (Chorus - 50 Cent) 
 I got a gat man 
 There's a problem I'm a solve it 
 A nigga movin' around 
 With a big ass revolver and I'm back, man 
 What the fuck are you retarded 
 You touch Shady I'll leave you dearly departed.
