Dre, niggas think we're bullshittin' 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Nigga try me, son, he best have the heat on him 
 Want my eyes closed, get to moppin' the street with him 
 Well, I put your body in a bag, front on me, I'm on ya ass 
 I bring money to my niggas that bring death to my enemies 
 I bring money to my niggas that bring death to my enemies 
 Nigga front on me, the goons and goblins come out 
 Wishmaster, hundred shot drums'll run out 
 They dumb out, you heard of me, they call me big homie 
 Me I make the register ring, I'm the cash cow 
 They make the hammers ring, they on ya ass now 
 Hair trigger, stare nigga, yeah, niggas'll flip 
 Six shot semi-assault, let it off at your will 
 Here I is, where the money is, I still get biz 
 D's know about the beef, you gon' still get did 
 It be your tombstone and your fuckin' grave they dig 
 Have that ass in the precinct tryna talk to the pigs 
 I'm like Damien, nigga, when I start gettin' loose on ya 
 Closest thing to Lucifer, you think you got a noose on ya 
 I make it hard to breathe 
 I come with your hustle, air it out, make it hard to eat 
 Have you lookin' both ways like you crossin' the street 
 Try me, son, he best have the heat on him 
 Want my eyes closed, get to moppin' the street with him 
 Well, I put your body in a bag, front on me, I'm on ya ass 
 I bring money to my niggas that bring death to my enemies 
 I bring money to my niggas that bring death to my enemies 
 Yeah, niggas send me the wrong message 
 We gon' fucking kill the messenger 
 Your whole clique hollow tips'll tear up the best of ya 
 This ain't the Carter nigga, this is Sparta 
 It's harder, I die and be a martyr, respect me like your father 
 Let off a clip or let a case off 
 I have your pussy ass runnin' like a race horse 
 Follow orders now yeah shoot his face off 
 You can have one, blast one, it's mad fun 
 See how when you listen to me, all of the cash gone 
 I was born with the tech, it's a birth defect 
 I was deceived in the bins, ended up in a Benz 
 This is what happens when have nots turn into Sasquatch 
 Let the gat pop, boogie down on the back blocks 
 It's horrific, nah, it's terrific 
 I got it if you sniff it, go head, nigga, twist it 
 Get lifted, goddamn, I'm gifted 
 Try me, son, he best have the heat on him 
 Want my eyes closed, get to moppin' the street with him 
 Well, I put your body in a bag, front on me, I'm on ya ass 
 I bring money to my niggas that bring death to my enemies 
 I bring money to my niggas that bring death to my enemies 
 Yeah, I tell 'em ride on 'em, then they ride on 'em 
 Get the line on 'em and squeeze the .9 on 'em 
 Head shot, .40 Glock, blow his mind on him 
 They say ain't not a jooks, leave the shines on 'em 
 Now you can watch me, nigga, like the police watch me 
 I move proper, go ahead catch a shell tryna stop me 
 That 430 Spider, carbon fiber 
 And my dog is like Al-Qaeda, natural fighter 
 Rapid fire, you're sweet like apple cider 
 The mac'll fire, mask like Michael Myers 
 It's off the wire when I get on my bullshit 
 No smiles, no laughs, you gets no pass 
 You can explain to my niggas while they whoop your ass 
 My hands itch when the money comes, it's hard to explain it 
 Last time I itched like this, a truckload came in 
 Get money, get bread, that's what I do, kid 
 Try me, son, he best have the heat on him 
 Want my eyes closed, get to moppin' the street with him 
 Well, I put your body in a bag, front on me, I'm on ya ass 
 I bring money to my niggas that bring death to my enemies 
 I bring money to my niggas that bring death to my enemies
