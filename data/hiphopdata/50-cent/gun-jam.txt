50 Cent: 
 Yeah this is just my intro 
 Its serious man this is Sirius Radio right here 
 GG Unit Radio 
 Shady ha ha ha 
 Just givin' 'em a little somethin' somethin' 
 (Verse 1: 50 Cent) 
 You screamin' ya gun jam 
 Nigga your gun ain't jam 
 They let off ya bitch ass ran 
 You screamin' ya gun jam 
 I know your type fam 
 You pussy I understand 
 You screamin' your gun jam 
 You run when the shots fire 
 You scared the fuck to death of that hollowtip diet 
 Intensive Care Unit after niggas get sprayed up 
 Jamaica Hospital third floor when you laid up 
 Make sure your bills get paid up 
 So its nine one one 
 When you see my gun 
 I'm popular nigga the police know me 
 Just cause of this rap shit I'm rich now homie 
 Man when you not around I got your bitch all on me 
 She want to be my wife now 
 She like my lifestyle 
 My shotty bumpin' it's the sweetest taboo 
 I play something smooth when I stunt in my coupe 
 Ooh you know these niggas ain't like me 
 Everything I say I got in these raps I got bee 
 The cars, the cribs, the jewels, the tools 
 The nines, the Tecs, the Macs ooh 
 The burners the gats man if you confused 
 I'll send a nigga from my hood to put a hole in you 
 I rock G Unit hats, hoodies and shoes 
 Got "G Unit" tatted on my bitch too 
 I drink G Unit water watchin' G Unit porn 
 This is Shade 45 nigga G Unit on 
 Mike Epps: 
 Fuck the COs 
 Fuck all of 'em makin' money off of niggas

 'Cause they can't make no more money off you 
 They was makin' a percentage off your head every day in there 
 Now you makin' off of them 
 Fuck 'em Yayo
