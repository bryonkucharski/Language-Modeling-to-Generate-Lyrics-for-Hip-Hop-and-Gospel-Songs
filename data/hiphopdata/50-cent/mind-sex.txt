Its 50, Yeah 
 It's time I laid back on Em', 
 Real smooth yeah. 
 I'm not down for the mind sex, 
 I'm tryin' to get some pussy and jet, 
 You can burn an inncent. 
 Lay back and relax, 
 Feal the good vibrations, 
 After me fuck I don't a conversation. 
 Pardon me love that ass lookin' right, 
 What you doin' tonight, 
 You should stop aight. 
 My body language say it all, 
 So we ain't gotta talk. 
 I got fly spot southside queens New York. 
 Now you know I wanna fuck, 
 No doubt but I wanna try a different route, 
 Don't say a word, 
 Un-button your blouse, 
 Pull that skirt down. 
 Come to my bed time to put it down. 
 I'm not down for the mind sex, 
 I'm tryin' to get some pussy and jet, 
 You can burn an inncent. 
 Lay back and relax, 
 Feal the good vibrations, 
 After we fuck I don't a conversation. 
 New princess show me your interests, 
 Wait let me guess you like my ghetto poetry. 
 Here's a little something I wrote down, 
 Incase you ever came around, 
 You hear that fly shit, 
 You know it's me. 
 Position after position, 
 I'll exploit your body, 
 Like an instuctor for yoga or advanced pilates. 
 Your working up a sweat, 
 You like it how I like it? 
 Go ahead go up and down, 
 I like it when you ride it. 
 I'm not down for the mind sex, 
 I'm tryin' to get some pussy and jet, 
 You can burn an inncent. 
 Lay back and relax, 
 Feal the good vibrations, 
 After we fuck I don't a conversation. 
 Mother fuckin' right I don't want no conversation, 
 Talk to a bitch try to explain to her why she should give me some boyzes and the bitch slow. First she know then she don't know if she gunna give some boyzes, she slow. So I ain't supposed to be hangin' out with no mentally retarted hoe, you know shit like that, you know what I'm sayin'? It's the kid man, It's the 50 man.
