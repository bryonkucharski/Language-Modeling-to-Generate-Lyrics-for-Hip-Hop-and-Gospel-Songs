This is hip hop, it go clip pop, it hit 'em if you hit me 
 Da clip pop it popped and it don't stop 
 Papa said we bang, bang boogie, we get 'em, oh goodie 
 Keep the hoodie when you're fuckin' with me, me, me 
 Now what you hear is not a test 
 I said it's not a test nigga it's not a test 
 Got my Teflon on wrapped around my chest 
 I do it the best, you heard I do it the best 
 Tuck the Nine by my spine all the time 
 Stunt when I want a dead nigga fuck wit mine 
 My neck and my ear get to flickin' like a strobe 
 My wrist and my whips have niggas like whoa 
 I'm the underground king, I reside on the throne 
 In the club wylin' out over Henny and Patron 
 Me I'm in the zone, yeah me, I'm in the zone 
 It's bottle after bottle 'til G-stacks are blown 
 Shawty in my ear like please take me home 
 Before the next song come on dawg we gone 
 Off to the hotel, motel, the holiday inn 
 She said if I knew you worked the cat from the back like that 
 I would've brought my friend 
 It go clip pop, it hit 'em if you hit me 
 Da clip pop it popped and it don't stop 
 Papa said we bang, bang boogie, we get 'em, oh goodie 
 Keep the hoodie when you're fuckin' with me, me, me 
 Clip pop, it hit 'em if you hit me 
 Da clip pop it popped and it don't stop 
 Papa said we bang, bang boogie, we get 'em, oh goodie 
 Keep the hoodie when you're fuckin' with me, me, me 
 I'm so raw yea I'm so raw 
 Me I'm so ghetto I'm oh so hardcore 
 I'm down by law this style you never saw 
 I give 'em jus a little then watch 'em fiend for more 
 Yeah, they want more, they hot and they want more 
 They love the way I kick it, they addicted to your boy 
 I'm ecstasy I'm the ultimate trip 
 I have ya in the mornin' like a dope fiend sick 
 Now feel the rush I'm like pure cocaine 
 I have the whole night club goin' insane 
 No matter how rich I get I'm never gonna change 
 I will let it rain, push me I'll let it rain 
 I do this shit myself lawyer money ain't a thang 
 The Unit is the game, the yin and the yang 
 We went from poor to rich now look we the shit 
 You best control your bitch or she'll be in the six 
 It go clip pop, it hit 'em if you hit me 
 Da clip pop it popped and it don't stop 
 Papa said we bang, bang boogie, we get 'em, oh goodie

 I'm fresh to death, I'm rockin' the vest 
 I'm strapped movin' round with the heat
