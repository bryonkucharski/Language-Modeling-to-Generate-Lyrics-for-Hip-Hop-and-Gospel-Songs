God gave me style 
 God gave me grace 
 God gave me style 
 God gave me grace 
 God put a smile on my face 
 Haha, God put this smile on my face 
 God made me shine like the sun 
 God make me shine like the sun 
 Sometimes I feel like I'm the one 
 Sometimes I feel like I'm the one 
 It ain't my fault 
 I just reach for style, I'm hot I breaks it down 
 It ain't my fault, you can't break it down the way I break it down 
 Listen you can call me what you want, black and ugly 
 But you can't convince me the Lord don't love me 
 When my cds drop, they sell the best 
 You call it luck, why can't it just be I'm blessed 
 I'm a trackstar, runnin' through life, chasin' my dream 
 Best deal I made was tradin a mic for a triple beam 
 I zone off thinkin' is there really heaven or hell 
 So what happens to a changed man who dies in a cell 
 I need no answers to these questions, 'cause time will tell 
 Got a date with destiny, she's more than a girl 
 Don't much good come from me, but my music 
 Is a gift given from God so I'ma use it (Yeah!) 
 God gave me style 
 God gave me grace 
 God gave me style 
 God gave me grace 
 God put a smile on my face 
 Haha, God put this smile on my face 
 God made me shine like the sun 
 God make me shine like the sun 
 Sometimes I feel like I'm the one 
 Sometimes I feel like I'm the one 
 It ain't my fault 
 I just reach for style, I'm hot I breaks it down 
 It ain't my fault, you can't break it down the way I break it down 
 Some days, I'm in the crowd all by myself 
 Bunch of niggas around I'm still by myself 
 I drift off on a cloud, by myself 
 Thinkin' bout nothin' more than life, what else 
 These days its hard to tell who really cares for me 
 So you when hear this song, you should say a prayer for me 
 I put a message in my music, hope it brightens your day 
 If times are hard, when you hear it, know you'll be okay 
 A OLD G told me God's favorites have a hard time 
 You out the hood, that's good now stay on the grind 
 I'm a spunge, knowledge and wisdom, my insult off fast 
 I'm in a class by myself, you do the math 
 God gave me style 
 God gave me grace 
 God gave me style 
 God gave me grace 
 God put a smile on my face 
 Haha, God put this smile on my face 
 God made me shine like the sun 
 God make me shine like the sun 
 Sometimes I feel like I'm the one 
 Sometimes I feel like I'm the one
