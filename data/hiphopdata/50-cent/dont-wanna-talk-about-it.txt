I don't wan' talk about it 
 Man, I don't wanna talk about it 
 Man, I don't wan' talk about it 
 And I don't wanna talk about it 
 I make millions quick and I don't wan' talk about it 
 Nah, I don't wanna talk about it 
 I shoot a nigga kid and I don't wan' talk about it 
 Nah, I don't wanna talk about it 
 I fuck the baddest bitches, I don't wan' talk about it 
 Nah, I don't wanna talk about it 
 I'm still flippin' chickens, I don't wan' talk about it 
 Nah, I don't wanna talk about it 
 Go 'head, ask me what I'm ridin' in so I can say the Enzo 
 My bitch roll down the window so I could feel the wind blow 
 Got big enough for me to fiddle on my kinfolk 
 Bitches with me cruisin', 'Moulin Rouge' and 
 They fuckin' and they strippin' nigga 
 I ain't even trippin' nigga 
 Me I handle business, God's my only witness 
 Watchin' homicide, sayin', "Who the fuck did this?" 
 Me I run the street mayne, so I keep the heat mayne 
 Sews what you reap, when you fuck with the elite mayne 
 I don't fuck around boy, you better ask around boy 
 I hit you with the pound, leave yo' ass on the ground 
 For you poppin' that bullshit, like I don't pull shit 
 Fully loaded clips and whips, get the grip, clip the bricks 
 Nigga we hittin' licks, stickin' shit, gettin' rich 
 That's why my name ring bells all around this bitch 
 Any hood you go through they know 50 Cent 
 I make millions quick and I don't wan' talk about it 
 Nah, I don't wanna talk about it 
 I shoot a nigga kid and I don't wan' talk about it 
 Nah, I don't wanna talk about it 
 I fuck the baddest bitches, I don't wan' talk about it 
 Nah, I don't wanna talk about it 
 I'm still flippin' chickens, I don't wan' talk about it 
 Nah, I don't wanna talk about it
