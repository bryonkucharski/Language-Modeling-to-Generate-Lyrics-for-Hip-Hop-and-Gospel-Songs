(Chorus: 50 Cent) 
 Ain't it amazing, how crazy, the hood dun made me 
 Feels like my emotions are froze 
 I stay G'd Up 
 It's the things that I seen 
 And the shit I've been through that made my heart turn cold 
 I stay G'd Up, 
 I'm a gangsta ya find out fo sho if you eva step on my toes 
 I stay G'd Up, 
 When I'm hangin' out tha window wit that AK 
 Fillin ya punk ass wit holes 
 I stay G'd Up 
 (50 Cent) 
 Cocaine, heroin, ecstasy, marijuana, 
 Mule on that Greyhound from the N-Y to the Carolinas, 
 Paper chase, different name 
 Same face, don't catch a case 
 My road dog's on parole 
 His baby gurls 4 years old 
 We play tha block, pistol cocked 
 You could shoot or get shot 
 Kill you for ur crack spot 
 Take everything your ass got 
 Semi-automatic spray 
 Bust back or run away 
 Niggaz talkin' in tha hood 
 We'll handle his another day 
 In November, you make my shitlist 
 You did, you can cancel christmas 
 I'll send you a gift 
 Niggaz will come and leave yo' ass twisted 
 Dem hollowtip shells burn baby burn 
 As a nigga get murked, a babies born and tha world turns 
 I seen it all crystal clear 
 So I keep my pistol near 
 Hearts never full of fear 
 Homie I stay well aware 
 Of what's goin' around me, muthafuckas want me dead 
 I go with a smile on my face, when it's my time kid 
 Lil nigga I dun paved the way, y'all should thank 'em, 
 But if you think otherwise bring ya boy over here so I could spank 'em 
 I'll put a end to your career bitch (bitch) 
 Before you speak on 50, buy .40 and a spare clip 
 These niggaz gassed up 
 Gettin' too used to rap 
 Like I won't give them more blood clots than supercat 
 Niggaz'll snatch ya 
 I'm like a backcatcher (nigga) 
 I'll give a sign and they'll throw sumthin at ya 
 Round here niggaz die off hydro 
 And even when it ain't 4th of July it sound like pyro 
 I'm smart enuff to creep and lay your dumb brains down 
 The pound (will) spin you around like tha young James Brown (yeah) 
 I know I'm hot but hey (hey) 
 I'm icy too 
 Rocks will hit you from a block away 
 Like a beat from Dr.Dre 
 We takin' over this year 
 K's and the soldiers is here 
 Everyone knows that your scared (yeah)! 
 (Young Buck) 
 My popa never bothered to show me what it was to be a man 
 He just pop another bottle 'n' smoke up a half a gram 
 I would hop in my Impala and ride all through the night 
 They gave my homeboy life 
 So when you do it do it right, 
 My fingernails still filled with cocaine residue 
 I still got tha heart to go and bust me a head or two (fo sho) 
 No other solution 
 You think we hollerin 'n' hootin' 
 Until you wake up (buck!) 
 Then you gotta here about these shootings 
 I take a pull from a loose one 
 And put tha clip in my pocket 
 Before I take another bullet I'm gonna pull it and pop it (bllaaatt) 
 And if its beef my nigga 
 Then let your guns do ya talkin' 
 The graveyard has got plenty room for a coffin (haha) 
 They say we responsible for boostin tha crime rate 
 They say that we da reason why these young niggaz buying weight 
 But I'm gonna keep this glock on my waist till my dyin'day 
 Its "Nuttin But A G Thang" G-Unit And Dr.Dre
