Yeah... 
 Its 50 
 One shot, One kill, What's the deal? 
 Yeah, what's the deal? 
 Listen... 
 Lil' homie, when it rains it pours 
 Hollow Tips and Talons, when it rains it pours 
 You caught in lead showers, just because 
 Niggaz ain't playin', when it rains it pours 
 Niggaz get set up, 'cause when it rains it pours 
 End up wed up, 'cause when it rains it pours 
 It usually, goes down over money and whores 
 But lil' homie, in my hood, when it rains it pours 
 Ain't nutin changed, niggaz doin' the same old shit 
 Them new Hollow tips and them same old clips 
 In the projects niggaz fuck with the same old chicks 
 And somehow they still think there game so sick 
 Now I'm finna rip, niggaz know I'm about my grip 
 I don't trick man I barely even feed a bitch 
 She say I'm stingy, I said I don't need you bitch 
 Go ahead leave, see if I chase you, shiit 
 Tell your mami, I catch her on the street I'ma get her 
 She know I'm on parole, why she call police on a nigga 
 She jus' mad, 'cause a nigga pockets all swoll' 
 When she asked to borrow sumthin', I said hell naw 
 I was tellin' the lil' homies all about this shit 
 So keep your mind on your money and don't trus no bitch 
 Keep your head high notes when them pigs came 
 But her ass kinda fat so niggaz treat her the same 
 This is real... 
 Lil' homie, when it rains it pours 
 Hollow Tips and Talons, when it rains it pours

 Niggaz ain't playin', when it rains it pours 
 Niggaz get set up, 'cause when it rains it pours 
 End up wed up, 'cause when it rains it pours 
 It usually, goes down over money and whores 
 But lil' homie, in my hood, when it rains it pours 
 It was blood stains on my stoop when ??Eyeball?? got shot 
 When homicide outside, nigga I'm not 
 It's the third time niggaz dunn circled the block 
 Its money out now, yeah, but damn its hot 
 They love to catch a nigga on a direct sale 
 They say tell us who caught the body or you goin' to jail 
 Look if you know the drill you stay the fuck outta dodge 
 Say what's happenin' to the captain and what's up to the searg' 
 Fuck bein' in a cage man that shit for the birds 
 Charlie drunk drinkin' While Irish Row's on the curb 
 I know a spot fulla niggaz tryna get a few bucks 
 Hopin' then nutin' come out they gon' have um some luck 
 PH to the deuce, they stumbled off Matt 
 Lost his re-up money man that's all he had 
 Magazine from the store so he can look at the cars 
 And do pull-ups in the park on the monkey bars 
 Man it's fucked... 
 Lil' homie, when it rains it pours 
 Hollow Tips and Talons, when it rains it pours 
 You caught in lead showers, just because 
 Niggaz ain't playin', when it rains it pours

 But lil' homie, in my hood, when it rains it pours
