Funk Flex 
 Yeah, G-Unit 
 You understand what's about to happen? 
 Huh ... huh? (do you understand?) 
 Nigga guess who's bizzack 
 It's not Beanie Sieg' or Jay-Hov' 
 50 Cent y'all niggas should know 
 Don't make me relapse 
 Run up on your ass with the fo' 
 You punk nigga I done told you before 
 Fuck being in a cage, man that shits for the birds 
 I do my dirt in the hood, but I live in the burbs 
 When you talk be careful how you choose your words 
 'Cause I send niggas to put ya fuckin' brains on the curb 
 Am I my brother's keeper? Yes I am 
 Nigga you know they gettin' low you see that gun in my hand 
 G-Unit - don't go fuckin' with my soldiers, boy 
 Get laid out, I'm'a say I told you boy 
 See you rollin' with 20 niggas, we rolling with 20 guns 
 16 hollows is loaded in every one 
 I know you slow, so 
 I do the math that's 320 shells flyin at your ass (ha) 
 You spend a lot of time talkin' about how you ball out 
 When you get hit you gonna run and bleed till you fall down 
 I guess you didn't think we was down to go all out 
 One second, you was wrong 
 You ain't on the shit we on 
 My money getting long 
 Now my team getting strong 
 I'm gone 
 Gone

 Kingpin style

 Make me cut something 
 Make me bust something
