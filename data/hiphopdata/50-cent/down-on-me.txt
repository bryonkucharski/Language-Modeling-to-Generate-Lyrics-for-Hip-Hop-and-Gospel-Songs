 She want it I can tell she want it 
 Want me to push up on it 
 Fore she know when I'm all on it 
 We get the party going liquor flowing this is fire 
 50 and Jeremih number 1 there's nothing higher 
 (Won't you go and) 
 Get it get it (I see you baby) 
 Work it work it, work it, work it 
 (Won't you, just put it down) 
 Get it get it 
 Work it work it 
 Break it break it down... 
 (Jeremih) 
 Ok she headed to the dancefloor and she slowly start to poppin' it 
 Something like my wrist piece everybody got to watching it 
 Girl you got that secret treasure, I'm gon' put a lock on it 
 Don't care what they say I would be stupid to be not on it (Ms. Vicky) 
 Heard you go that sticky 
 Lets go and take 9 shots we'll just call it fifty 
 And I'm gon lick it lick it lick it 
 Till her hicky have her River running 
 Keep you running till you empty 
 (Bang bang bang bang) 
 Oh you look so sweet 
 What you work in Ballys 
 Look at your pysique 
 Girl you are a beauty well I am a beast 
 They must have been trippin' to let me off a leash 
 (Jeremih Chorus) 
 I love the way you grind with that booty on me 
 Shorty you a dime why you looking lonely 
 We'll buy another round and it's all on me 
 As long as I'm around put it down on me 
 Just put it down on me 
 Put it down on me 
 Down down on me 
 Put it down on me 
 Don't throw it off the mound 
 Show me how its gon be 
 Girl all I really want is you down on me 
 Put it down on me 
 (50 cent) 
 Systems thumping party jumping 
 Shorty she's a perfect 10 
 She rock her hips than roll her hips 
 Than drop it down like it's nothing 
 She shaped just like an hour glass 
 She see how fast an hour passed 
 Time flies when I'm on that ass 
 But I won't put our sh-t on blast 
 Work it like a pro pro pro 
 Sit and watch it go go go 
 Do her thing all on the floor 
 She bounce it fast and shake it slow 
 So sexual incredible 
 She beautiful she edible 
 I got her I won't let her go 
 I ain't seen nothing better yo 
 Look at how she twurk it 
 The way she work it 
 Make me wanna hit it hit it 
 Heaven when I'm in it in it 
 If I do not fit, I'm gonna make it 
 Girl you can take it 
 Don't stop get it get it 
 (Jeremih) 
 Say you independent 
 Get it from your momma 
 Tell me if you with it 
 Do you really wanna wanna 
 Baby when you see me 
 You know I be on it 
 Can you keep it up 
 Put it all up on me 
 (Repeated)
