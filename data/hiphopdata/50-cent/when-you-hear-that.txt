(Feat. Tony Yayo) 
 [50 Cent:] You want some of this? 
 (Chorus: 50 Cent) 
 When you hear that... [gun cocking] 
 Nigga its on 
 When you hear that... [gun cocking] 
 You better be gone 
 It could be in the late night or in the morn 
 Shells will bend your ass up word is born 
 When you hear that... [gun cocking] 
 Nigga its on 
 When you hear that... [gun cocking] 
 You better be gone 
 It could be in the late night or in the morn 
 Shells will bend your ass up word is born 
 (Verse 1: 50 Cent) 
 You say you a shooter nobody believes you 
 I don't say I'm a shooter I just shoot if I need to 
 Gat bust 
 Adrenaline rush 
 High off dust 
 Rap tycoon 
 Mossberg boom 
 Nigga I go through ya whole set 
 I come through ya hood bumpin' Bobby Womack 
 Old school, new school 
 Nigga don't move 
 I run up right behind your ass lightin' up the tool 
 Nigga what? 
 (Chorus: 50 Cent) 
 When you hear that... [gun cocking] 
 Nigga its on 
 When you hear that... [gun cocking] 
 You better be gone 
 It could be in the late night or in the morn 
 Shells will bend your ass up word is born 
 When you hear that... [gun cocking] 
 Nigga its on 
 When you hear that... [gun cocking] 
 You better be gone 
 It could be in the late night or in the morn 
 Shells will bend your ass up word is born 
 Tony Yayo: 
 Yeah nigga 
 50 nigga 
 You know what time it is 
 The Talk Of New York 
 (Verse 2: Tony Yayo) 
 I'm like a Mexican drug lord my cash come quicker 
 I'm sittin' on bricks like a Columbian nigga 
 Movin' Coke alot of that white shit 
 On the Amtrak comin' back with this dyke chick 
 And this white bitch 
 Man I just bought a nice whip 
 Chi Chi get that Yayo homie toss that brick 
 They lovin' my product 
 They fiendin' to buy it 
 Man I got these fiends gettin' skinny like Bohemian Diets 
 Po Po they creep pass 
 Man I peep task 
 They lookin' at my face 'cause I shoot like Steve Nash 
 The Llama in the truck 
 Baby mama baggin' up 
 Got Medina in the cut 
 So these fiends ballin' up 
 (Chorus: 50 Cent) 
 When you hear that... [gun cocking] 
 Nigga its on 
 When you hear that... [gun cocking] 
 You better be gone 
 It could be in the late night or in the morn 
 Shells will bend your ass up word is born 
 When you hear that... [gun cocking] 
 Nigga its on 
 When you hear that... [gun cocking] 
 You better be gone 
 It could be in the late night or in the morn 
 Shells will bend your ass up word is born 
 50 Cent:

 Ah man

 You just 'gon give 'em that for free? 
 Ah man
