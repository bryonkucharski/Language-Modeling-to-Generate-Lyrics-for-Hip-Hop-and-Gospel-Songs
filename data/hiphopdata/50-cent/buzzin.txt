Man I feel like money (man I feel like money) 
 They're attracted to me 
 They come around like honey (they come around like honey) 
 'Cause I'm fly like a bee 
 Man I got 'em all buzzin' buzzin' buzzin' buzzin' 
 Like da-da-da-da-da-da-da 
 Man I got the world buzzin' buzzin' buzzin' buzzin' 
 Like da-da-da-da-da-da-da 
 Uh, back up to back up in the mix like that 
 And I know ya like it when it's just like that 
 All the girlies just love my swag 
 From my kicks to the way I fix my hat 
 I'm... back 
 Fresh like some new J's 
 Brodie got next NBA to pay 
 I'm too paid 
 Shaded with some ladies 
 Reppin' my city 
 West LA baby! 
 West LA made me this way 
 Two rules: 
 Stay fresh, homie and get paid 
 Hey! 
 Never broke and never bummy 
 I'm from where it's forever sunny 
 Man I feel like money (man I feel like money)

 When I come around, 'round, 'round 
 They go 
 Yeah, yeah it's going down, down, down 
 They go 
 New cat with a old school feel 
 Only new artist with a old school deal 
 Tied to the game by Steve Lobell 
 So we always win, don't receive no help 
 New girls act like they know me so well 
 But I shows no love and be like oh well 
 When my album drops, sure as hell gon' sell 
 Stack cash and laugh like L-O-L 
 Man I feel like money (man I feel like money) 
 They're attracted to me 
 They come around like honey (they come around like honey) 
 'Cause I'm fly like a bee

 Saying all the things that I wanna hear

 And as the night ends
