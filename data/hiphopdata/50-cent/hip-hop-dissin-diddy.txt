Why haven't you learned anything? 
 1, 2, 1, 2 
 Nigga, I run hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip 
 Nigga, G-Unit is hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip hop 
 One thing 'bout my music, it hits you feel the pain 
 Nigga, I take control of your brain 
 Listen now, nigga, I'm not playin' 
 Are you ready for that? Soldier, soldier grab your gat 
 I'll show you who to aim it at 
 Bang bang bang, run, toss the gat 
 No, no, no, no lookin' back 
 Nigga, leave the watch, we ain't come for that 
 Bitch quit playin', where the paper at? 
 Shit I rolled ace, I'm shootin' it back 
 Damn you, Curtis Jackson for killing hip hop 
 Damn you, damn you and your money making ways 
 Bring it back, 1, 2, 1, 2 
 Nigga, I run hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip 
 Nigga, G-Unit is hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip hop 
 One thing 'bout my music, it hits you feel the pain 
 Nigga, I take control of your brain 
 Listen now, nigga, I'm not playin' 
 Are you ready for that? Soldier, soldier grab your gat 
 I'll show you who to aim it at 
 Bang bang bang, run, toss the gat 
 No, no, no, no lookin' back 
 Nigga, leave the watch, we ain't come for that 
 Bitch quit playin', where the paper at? 
 Shit I rolled ace, I'm shootin' it back 
 Every body know how my paper stack 
 20 inch chrome on the Cadillac 
 Automatic shotgun, can you handle that? 
 All the bullshit, nigga, that's a fact 
 Ride through your motherfuckin' hood strapped 
 Put work in, nigga, that's that 
 Things get to bust and you'll blast back 
 Got a little money, wanna flash that 
 'Til the wolves come out and blast gats 
 Pedal to the metal, nigga, mash that 
 'Fore your ass end up in a casket, I said in a casket 
 Who shot Biggie Smalls? 
 If we don't get them, they gon' kill us all 
 Man, Puffy know who hit that nigga, man, that nigga soft 
 He's scared dem boys from the Westside will break him off 
 Jump on his ass, so he run to Harlem to shake 'em off 
 Nigga, I run hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip 
 Nigga, G-Unit is hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip hop 
 Nigga, I run hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip 
 Nigga, G-Unit is hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip hop 
 Oh, I guess this means I won't be invited 
 To the white parties in the Hamptons, I don't give a fuck 
 I don't wanna hang out with your punk ass no way 
 Got me motherfuckin' runnin' around this nigga Ma$e 
 Now you wanna play games? You wanna make the deal, nigga? 
 Man, I'll fuck your shit up, nigga, is you crazy, nigga? 
 Matter 'fact, know what? I don't wanna do a deal no more 
 Fuck the deal, nigga, you wanna play games? 
 You wanna waste my motherfuckin' time, nigga? 
 Time is money, nigga, you wastin' the motherfuckin' money, nigga 
 Aight, I see what you tryin' to do 
 But I don't know why you doin' what you tryin' to do 
 Why do you wanna make me tell everybody what Misa told me, huh? 
 Now you go on and you send me 50 thousand dollars 
 For this nigga travel fees, you know, airfare, hotel space 
 For that last tour, nigga, 'fore I really service your ass, nigga
