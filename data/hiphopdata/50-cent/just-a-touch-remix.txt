(Feat. Paul Wall) 
 Yeah! It's 50! 
 (Chorus: 50 Cent) 
 She got a have it man she powder her nose 
 And you can see she was a freak I suppose 
 She in the telly she use all three holes 
 Man you know me I just go with the flow 
 Just a touch, a blow, a lil' bit 
 (Verse 1: 50 Cent) 
 And it's on, up and down she like to ride on top 
 Fast, prayin' that the condom pop 
 That's foul, but fuck it it's all hood to me 
 Now Hollywood's been real real good to me 
 Now who gives a fuck if a bitch just ain't shit 
 In the whip she gives CPR to my dick 
 You losin 'em baby, get 'em up quick 
 This role play I'm really gettin' into this shit 
 In the telly on all fours I'm ridin' that horse 
 Screamin WOO HA! till my voice is lost 
 Call me 50 call me daddy you can call me the boss 
 My dick XXL you can call me The Source 
 You can lie 'bout my performance and give bad reviews 
 A quickie suppose to be quick bitch I kept on my shoes 
 Oh you thought we had a love thing girl you confused 
 Don't listen to the gossip it's never ever true 
 They say I do things that I never ever do 
 On the radio, they say me and you a item 
 Nas fall in love with hoes me I just like 'em 
 I can't be your man Paris head game great 
 And Eve's usin' dildos on her sex tape 
 Ashanti's lil' ass butt naked in the truck 
 These bitches is poppin' off why would I tie myself up 
 At the Super Bowl Janet Jackson showed me a tit 
 Other niggaz saw it but I felt she showed me it 
 Times is hard in the yard baby this is real shit 
 My record sales slow, I'm a show you my dick 
 (Verse 2: Paul Wall) 
 It's Paul Wall Baby 
 I'm a let you know what it do, you know what I'm talking about? 
 I've give these bitches the pipe 
 They take a puff and they addicted for life 
 Gon' kiss the mic, but baby girl just don't bite 
 Hitting whores from the back, it's more addicting then crack 
 That's why I'm fucking every night and skeeting nut on they back 
 I'm addicted to groupie love, ménage three ain't new 
 I treat these boppers like my music; all I want is to screw 
 So when I come through, you know I'm armed with both straps 
 One filled with hollow tips, the other in the gold pack 
 You could call me "Southern Slaughter" when I beat a bitch out 
 It's like war under them sheets, I leave these whores shell shocked 
 I have them sitting sideways, and walking sideways 
 Beat it up and skeet it up and leave they mind in a daze 
 I'm a professional ladies man, player at leisure 
 Hit it twice and she might fuck around and start having seizures 
 Whores tell me I'm the champ, they got they eyes on my prize 
 My track record tells that all this all truth, no lies 
 I'm Paul Wall baby 
 She got a have it man she powder her nose 
 And you can see she was a freak I suppose 
 She in the telly she use all three holes 
 Man you know me I just go with the flow 
 Just a touch, a blow, a lil' bit 
 Wait a minute baby hold on, I'm just tryin' to fix the camera 
 You know, relax, ha ha h, I'm comin', yeah 
 It's on you got the water in the tub 
 Wanna get in the tub, ha ha ha ha 
 She got a have it man she powder her nose 
 And you can see she was a freak I suppose 
 She in the telly she use all three holes 
 Man you know me I just go with the flow 
 Just a touch, a blow, a lil' bit, and it's on
