The realest thing that you can do is just putting a drum beat whit nothing but a drum beat 
 Niggers, niggers copy my style so I need to swithc up on them

 See they know now, I won't hesitate to make shit hot 
 D's will shut your block down, after your shot down 
 We gonna come through and set up shop 
 You niggas gone work for me now, you gone see now
