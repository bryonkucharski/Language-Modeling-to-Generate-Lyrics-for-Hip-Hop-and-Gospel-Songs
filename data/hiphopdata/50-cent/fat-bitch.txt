Yea, we over here, with some fat chicks, haha 
 (50 Cent) 
 Yo, I don't be fucking with them fat bitches 
 That's Yayo, all the fat bitches 
 Don't be stuck on the things they say, now you know it's a nasty world 
 I ain't fucking with you anyway, 'cause I know you're a nasty girl 
 I ain't ever gonna discriminate, so let me compliment your eyes 
 (50 Cent) 
 Fat, fat, them Snickers got your ass getting fat, fat 
 Those cookies got your ass getting fat, fat 
 That Cake got your ass getting fat, fat 
 Bitch you grown, that ain't baby fat, fat 
 (50 Cent) 
 In the gym I see your ass up on the Stairmaster 
 But you got it on level two bitch go a little faster 
 Look girl, I ain't gonna lie, I'll tell you how I feel 
 They should handcuff your big ass to the treadmill 
 You wanna work out now, 'cause you know it's getting hot 
 And your big ass fitting to pop all up out a halter top 
 Find a right chick wearing some tight shit and it's on 
 See your ass wear some tight shit we like, "She wrong" 
 Don't be stuck on the things they say, now you know it's a nasty world 
 I ain't fucking with you anyway, 'cause I know you're a nasty girl 
 I ain't ever gonna discriminate, so let me compliment your eyes

 That Burger King done got your ass fat, fat 
 McDonald's done got your ass fat, fat 
 That Domino's done got your ass fat, fat 
 Fat, Fat 
 (Lloyd Banks) 
 I like 'em slim in the waste 
 Curves in the right place 
 A bitch with hips, lips, and a tight face 
 Your appetite will put a dent up in a nigga's salary 
 You need to stop burning that weed and burn them calories 
 Your attitude is like you always had gear 
 You got a ponytail, you ain't always have hair 
 I just love to see your capris coming down, mami leave 
 On the town, stay away if you 300 pounds 
 Don't be stuck on the things they say, now you know it's a nasty world 
 I ain't fucking with you anyway, 'cause I know you're a nasty girl 
 I ain't ever gonna discriminate, so let me compliment your eyes 
 (50 Cent) 
 Fat, fat, them cinnasticks got your ass fat, fat 
 Them Little Debbie's done got your ass fat, fat 
 These cupcakes done got your ass fat, fat 
 Fat, fat 
 (Tony Yayo) 
 I ain't gonna trip, I hang at the bar with my wallet 
 I'm freaking off in your car or your closet 
 And ain't nothing wrong with a big, strong girl 
 If you could cook your ass off, I'll give you the world 
 You could be skinny or fat, white or black 
 Nigga pussy is pussy, so yea, I'll hit that 
 I'm a freak, so I love menage a trois 
 And I really care less if you twice my size 
 Don't be stuck on the things they say, now you know it's a nasty world 
 I ain't fucking with you anyway, 'cause I know you're a nasty girl 
 I ain't ever gonna discriminate, so let me compliment your eyes 
 (50 Cent) 
 Them Snickers got your ass getting 
 Those cookies got your ass getting fat, fat 
 That Cake got your ass getting fat, fat 
 Bitch you grown, that ain't baby fat, fat 
 (50 Cent)
