Hail Mary 2003 (Ja Rule Diss) 
 (Feat. 50 Cent, Busta Rhymes) 
 (Eminem) 
 Makaveli rest in peace 
 Irv Gotti, too much Bacardi in his body 
 Mouth like a .12 gauge shotti 
 (2x) 
 Come get me 
 If you mothafuckers want Shady 
 If Pac was still here now 
 He would never ride with Ja 
 (Eminem) 
 You ain't no killa, you a pussy 
 That exstacy dun' got you all emotional and moushy 
 Bitches wearin rags in photos, Ja's words bein quoted 
 In the SOURCE, stealin 'Pac's shit like he just wrote it 
 You loud mouth, pray to God, hopin no one's listenin 
 See 50 comin' for me, Oh my God my, my position 
 No one will pay attention 
 To me, please Gotti, here I go 
 Gimme this pill, exstacy dun' got me feelin' so 
 Invincible 
 Now all of a sudden I'm a fuckin' mad man who screams 
 Like I'm 'Pac but I'm not, enemies, Hennesy 
 Actin' like I'm great, but I'm fake, I'm CRAZY 
 Sweat drip, get me off this trip, someone stop this train 
 Some say my brain is all corrupted, fucked from this shit 
 I'm stuck, I'm addicted to these drugs, I'ma quit 
 Sayin' mothafucka's name's before somebody fucks me up 
 Ain't no pussies over here, partner, see you hell, fucker 
 (Eminem Sings) 
 Come get me 
 Motherfucker, If you want Shady 
 If Pac was still here now 
 He would never ride with Ja 
 Get off that E 
 Before you try to come and fuck with me 
 It's Aftermath here now 
 Shady Records got it locked 
 La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
 (50 Cent) 
 Temesentruries is packed with promise makers 
 Never realized the precious time them bitch niggas is wastin 
 Insitutionalize, my bitches bring me product by the bundles 
 Hustle hard from the cell, G-Unit mothafucka, WE BALLIN 
 Catch me countin' trees and when I'm callin 
 Can you set my car, Ceo let me sip on Henessy, "Can I sip some more?" 
 Hell, I done been in jail, I ain't scared 
 Momma checkin' in my bedroom, I ain't there 
 I got a head with no screws in it 
 Mothafuckas thinkin' they can stop 50... they losin it 
 Lil' nigga named Ja, think he live like me 
 Talkin' about he left the hospital, took 9 like me 
 You live in fantasies nigga 
 I rejected deposit 
 When your lil sweet ass comin' out of the closet 
 Now he wonderin why DMX blowed him out 
 Next time grown folks talkin' bitch close your mouth 
 Peep me I take this war shit deeply 
 Seen too many real niggas ballin let these bitch niggas beat me 
 Yous a mothafuckin punk and you don't see me with gloves 
 Quit scarin them fuckin' kids with ya ulgy ass mug 
 And you can tell them niggas you roll with whatever you want 
 But you and I know what's goin' on 
 Nigga pay back Tah, I know your bitch ass from way back 
 Witness be strap with max You know I don't play that 
 All these old rappers tryin' to advance it's all over now -- take it like a man 
 HAHA--Irv lookin' like Larry Holmes, flabby and sick 
 Tryin' to playa hate on my shit- Man, eat a fat dick 
 Lovin' this shit that's how you made me 
 Feelin' like I got you niggas crazy 
 Against all odds up with my thug mothafuckas know 
 This'll be the realist shit I ever wrote 
 Against all odds, up in the studio gettin' blow to the truest shit I ever 
 Spoke, 21 gun salute 
 (Busta Rhymes:) 
 Hey yo I've been one of the most humble, rep the streets to the core 
 Hey Jeffrey, What the fuck you come involvin with me for? 
 It's been a long time comin' like a bless and a check 
 You see 106 and park fans don't even fuckin' respect you 
 Its kinda funny wanna be Pac, wanna fake like like he thug 
 Runnin' around talkin' shit that he ain't capable of 
 Now let me OFF this cock sucka watch me handle you nigga 
 If I recall Violator used to manage you nigga then took a closer look and 
 Realized you was an impostor there's never been a Violator on a Murda Inc 
 Roster 
 Dumb ass Now who shoot?-- Ah made you look, you said Bus' singin' the same ol' 
 You Stupid if y'all shoot I take a look at ya man tha bitch shot himself infront 
 Of Def Jam 
 Chedda Bob ass nigga start adjustin ya plan 
 You let the streets down nigga 'pologize to ya fans 
 Watch ya pull a lil stunt like we ain't know where you are 
 Lil faggot desperate tryin' to establish a buzz I know tha shit is drivin' you 
 Crazy You wonderin how 
 The streets ain't never want you Beatrice what you gonna do now? 
 Now if you wanna beef with me, then I'm beefin with you 
 I think about tha game and what it's like Ah--WHAT WOULD IT BE WITHOUT YOU 
 You finished I ain't tryin' to repeat this just because I'm cool shouldn' 
 Take my kindness for weakness 
 (Busta speakin') 
 It was fun Next time you got a problem man, Address me 
 Before you make shit a public issue homie, Now I'ma return back to my regular 
 Self and have fun again
