Shadyville Entertainment, Bad Boy collaboration 
 I love niggas! I love niggas! 
 Cause niggas are me! 
 And I should only love that 'presents me 
 I love to see niggas go through changes (Whoooo!) 
 I love to see niggas shoot through shit (Did it again) 
 And to all niggas that do it I love 
 To all my Brooklyn (Niggas!) 
 To all my Uptown (You niggas understand?!) 
 To all my Bronx (It's war nigga) 
 To all my Queensbridge (I'll blow you away) 
 Back up chump, you know Biggie Smalls grips it quick 
 And kicks it quick, you know how black niggas get 
 With the hoods fatigues with the boots with trees 
 Smokin' weed, flippin ki's, makin' crazy G's 
 Hittin' buckshots at niggas that open spots 
 On the avenue, take my loot, and I'm baggin you 
 Pimpin' hoes that drive Volvo's and Rodeos 
 Flash the Roll, make her wet, in her pantyhose 
 Damn, a nigga style is unorthodox 
 Grip the glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks 
 Just in case a nigga wanna act out 
 I just black out, and blow they motherfuckin back out 
 That's real 
 We the realest nigga 
 50 Cent and B.I.G. my nigga 
 Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga 
 Biggie yo nigga, 50 yo nigga 
 Squeeze the trigga' leave a nigga fa' sho! 
 We the realest nigga 
 50 Cent and B.I.G. my nigga 
 Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga 
 Biggie yo nigga, 50 yo nigga 
 Squeeze the trigga' leave a nigga fa' sho! 
 When we smoke spliffs, we pack four-fifths 
 Just in case dread wanna riff 
 He get a free lift to the cemetery, rough very 
 Not your ordinary, we watch you get buried 
 That's a real nigga for ya 
 Get mad do a quarter flip the script, and rip your lawyer 
 Spit at the D.A. cause fuck what she say 
 She don't give a fuck about your ass anyway 
 Up North found first stop Watertown 
 Of fist-skill, where the hand skills are real ill 
 You'll be a super Hoover doo-doo stain remover 
 Ha hah, yo Chief, pass the Buddha 
 We the realest nigga 
 50 Cent and B.I.G. my nigga 
 Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga

 50 Cent and B.I.G. my nigga 
 Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga 
 Biggie yo nigga, 50 yo nigga 
 Squeeze the trigga' leave a nigga fa' sho! 
 When I was young my M.O. was to go hand-to-hand 
 And even my P.O. she called me the Ginger Bread Man 
 I catch a new case, and tell her ass "catch me if you can" 
 Don't let your people fill you up wit octane I'm not playing 
 Get gassed up to get blast up 
 Real B.I.G. style watch the kid break it down 
 Check it, thou shalt not fuck wit North C. Papa 
 50 Cent, I'll break yo ass off propa' 
 There's no place like home, New York - New York 
 I run this city, I don't dance around like Diddy 
 Niggas is giddy, till they act smack silly 
 Or spray wit the Mack Milly, they don't want drama really 
 Pussy niggas get hard lip syncing my lyrics like Milly Vanilly 
 Even the hood they feel me {*gun cocked*} hah! I'm on fire! 
 Niggas out in Philly they feel me, they bump my shit 
 Every bootlegger you know, bump my shit, bitch! 
 We the realest nigga 
 50 Cent and B.I.G. my nigga 
 Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga 
 Biggie yo nigga, 50 yo nigga 
 Squeeze the trigga' leave a nigga fa' sho! 
 We the realest nigga 
 50 Cent and B.I.G. my nigga 
 Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga 
 Biggie yo nigga, 50 yo nigga 
 Squeeze the trigga' leave a nigga fa' sho!
