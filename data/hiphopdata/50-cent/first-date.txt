Big boy! 
 Just one night, 2 nights, could be 3 of us 
 Girl we can get it on, girl we can have a ball 
 Bring your girlfriend, come on 
 Life's too short to not fuck on the first date 
 No one knows if we're promised tomorrow 
 But if we make love into the next day 
 We'll have the best of our time celebrating

 4 in the morning now girl I don't wanna talk 
 We've been talking for hours, now you know I wanna fuck 
 Look I don't understand what is it you don't understand 
 My watch 100 grand, my chain 100 grand, 
 I'm a wanted man, I say I run new york 
 'Cause I do what the fuck I wanna do, they know what's up 
 They say my school's a loose, I say who dares, you know I'm rich 
 Look I don't have time to blow it up... this shit 
 Now maybe you can loosen up and let me go to work 
 So I can whisper in your ear while pulling down your skirt 
 When I get this... girl you don't know what to say 
 We can come... girl I'm gone right away 
 Yeah, you nasty girl, you nasty 
 And I'm into that, so get at me 
 I don't want no good, good, good, good girl 
 Me, I want a nasty girl, come freak with me 
 Be a freak for me

 I said ew, I wanna fuck you in the worst way 
 Hell yeah I wanna fuck you on the first day 
 If I don't, I say fuck you on Thursday 
 'Cause then I won't want you, watch how fast I dump you 
 But right now I'm infatuated, 
 You get to hang with me, girl you graduated 
 I take you out to drinks and get you tipsy 
 Then I pull my dick out and I say kiss me 
 You bout to laugh your little panties off 
 You only get one date, you better... 
 They wanna ride in fancy cars, that's what babies do 
 They like to fuck... she's a nasty little tramp 
 But I like that, so let's fuck 
 I don't want no good, good, good, good girl 
 Me, I want a nasty girl, come freak with me 
 Be a freak for me
