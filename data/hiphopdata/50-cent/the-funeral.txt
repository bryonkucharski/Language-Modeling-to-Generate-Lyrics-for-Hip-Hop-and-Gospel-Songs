You forgot my style 
 Flowers, a funeral service, a kid's in the coffin 
 It sound so familiar, don't it happen so often? 
 The shoot-out shit happens, the sister read the eulogy 
 Couldn't help but think 
 nigga better you than me 
 .38 ain't got no safety, that bullet ain't got a name on it 
 But it's hard to miss when that thing got a beam on it 
 First shot, pop off, everybody popping shots 
 The glass at the store front, we forgot God was watching 
 Run, run, hit the gate, D's yelling 
 drop it 
 Niggas getting jammed up, better that than a jammed up 
 His momma said a few words to her, he was innocent 
 She might have heard he did some shit, but never saw no benefits 
 So in her eyes, he's mommy's little baby 
 But he was outside talking to niggas crazy 
 In a room full of people came to pay their respect 
 I just came in to get a close look at nigga to check 
 That nigga dead as a doorknob, stiff as a nail 
 And my man, tomorrow he gon' get out of jail 
 ROR, trust me nigga I know the law 
 Release on your own recognizance, that bullshit I'm on it 
 That's his first taste, I mean his first case 
 Got knocked with the strap, but not the one that clapped 
 This nigga here we still got that, yeah 
 First law in my hood is show no fear 
 Him and love was closer than we thought, that nigga in here crying 
 Oh shit, in the store, he probably passed him the iron 
 These some grimy ass niggas, full breed vultures 
 Trying to come up, still eating around roaches 
 Cookie Crisp, Captain Crunch, breakfast of the champions 
 Lucky charms, stay armed, niggas won't clap you then 
 We watch the side bitch talking like she a main bitch 
 His wifey just sat there, preachers weren't saying shit 
 Right jab, left hook, hand full of weave 
 This type shit a nigga got to see to believe 
 These bitches acting up in here 
 Police they don't fucking care 
 Homicides snooping around of them, we all with the shit 
 Cousin back from college saying he gon' get who did this shit 
 He a ball player nigga, nigga better play ball 
 You play with the wrong niggas we gon' get to letting off 
 I done seen enough, feel like it's time for me to split 
 Hit the parking lot, chill where the weed is lit 
 Twist the cap, pour out a little liquor 
 All the theatrics, you know, like that was my nigga 
 We all can't win, some of us got to lose 
 Envision a lil' dog barking at a pack of wolves 
 Cause that's what happened, yeah yeah, that's what happened 
 He just went on and on till niggas started attacking 
 Acting like he was the only motherfucker packing 
 50 bars of pleasure, 50 bars of pain 
 When I'm dead and I'm gone niggas will remember the name 
 It's 50 
 50 bars of pleasure, 50 bars of pain 
 When I'm dead and I'm gone niggas will remember the name 
 It's 50
