(Lil Kim Hook) 
 You know you want me, you probably want to kiss this 
 Act like it's Christmas, and put me on your wish list 
 When it go down, I'ma help you pull your whiskers 
 Put your lips on my lips and taste my honey 
 (50 Cent Hook) 
 You know you want me, you probably want to lick this 
 Girl I'm a treat, everyday you can't get this 
 I'm busy man, I be handling my business 
 But we can get our freak on on some quick shit 
 50 Cent Verse 
 Tonight's the night shawty, you'll never forget this 
 I dim the lights, I get it right I'm like a pimp 
 Sit right down on the bed, I'll make the clothes disappear quick 
 I see through her shield, her pearl look pretty clear kid 
 I'm turned on, I really want to hit 
 Kiss her neck and nibble, until I way down by her waist kid 
 Man she's a freak, I'm a freak, I be freakin' off 
 When she come in with her friends, I'm like take it off 
 I got a fetish for the cheddar, yeah I'm rich bitch 
 That don't mean I'm running round buying chicks shit 
 You see the chrome out, been shining on my new 6 
 My pinky ring, my neck and my ears and my wrist lick 
 I like the ice, I'm pretty nice on the dice trips 
 Twice in row, you know, I got to get the dough 
 My confidence is high, I know I can hit a lik 
 My G's pretty good, I know I can get the bitch

 Lil Kim Verse 
 I'll be your wife, I'll be your girl, I'll be your mistress 
 But if you ain't spending that dough, you gettin' dismissed 
 That means you got to me leased like a seamstress 
 You can't expect nothing less from the Queen, Bitch! 
 My doggy style make you want to jump on that 
 Just like a dog on the chase for the kitty-cat 
 Now he's a freak, I'm a freak, I be freakin' off 
 He pour the honey on me, then he eat it off 
 I take his breathe away, Kim leave him speechless 
 I'm so wet, I have a nigga feelin' sea sick 
 He in the streets all day, but it's all right 
 'Cause he be back tonight, and then the next night 
 And then the next night, because the sex tight 
 I'll be his Advil, I got to keep his head right 
 He outta town and he feening for me every night 
 He so addicted, sending for me on the next flight
