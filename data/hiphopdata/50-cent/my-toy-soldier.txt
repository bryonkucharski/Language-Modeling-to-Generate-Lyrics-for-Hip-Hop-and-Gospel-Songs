(Intro- 50 Cent) 
 You ready? OK let me wind you up 
 Do it exactly the way I say do it 
 Man, these niggas are pussy, you heard me? 
 Get up nice and close (yeah!) 
 (Chorus- 50 Cent) 
 I put that battery in his back 
 I'm the reason why he move like that 
 That's my mu'fuckin' toy Soldier 
 I tell him pop that gat, he gon' pop that gat 
 You don't wanna play wit my Toy Soldier 
 I say it's on, then it's on 
 Until ya life is over, Fuckin' wit my Toy Soldier 
 If he's a casualty in war, trust me I got more 
 You don't want it wit my Toy Soldier 
 (Verse 1: 50 Cent) 
 This is so close, now follow instructions 
 Catch a nigga slippin, run up on him and buck him 
 I ain't got no conscience, them whores are nothin' 
 They ain't wit us, they against us, We supposed to touch em 
 Here's what to do if you see him approach me, 
 Pop that nigga, "I don't care if you know me. 
 Half the niggas hatin' on me used to be homies 
 I don't trust 'em when they smile or when they frown, 'cause they foney 
 Everytime I come around they call the police on me 
 That's why the D's in the precinct know me 
 They know 'bout my rap shit, they know bout how I clap people 
 I'm like I'm in a track meet, swift wit the mack, B 
 You could see the envy in they eyes fa sho mayne 
 Mad as a mothafucka that I'm holdin' 
 See me in the back of the Phantom Rollin' 
 Quick to make examples outta niggas fa sho man 
 Hold me down 
 (Verse 2: 50 Cent) 
 Shoot, Stab, Kill mufucka 
 You ain't 'bout it I don't want ya around, cocksucker 
 Every word out my mouth is felt 
 That uz I pop, them hollow's so hot, yo ass will melt 
 Barber razor in the club, stunt n I'll give you a ?? stich, 
 Gored, ya head all taped up 
 Niggas know how I get down, see they know when I'm around 
 Haha, my soldiers around in this, 
 Some shit go down, and a nigga get laid down 
 Its no surprise cause niggas know how I get down 
 Black tint on the Testarossa, 
 Hammer out the holster, gat in my lap in case you gotta get clapped 
 You monkey niggas swing through my hood, we on that gorilla shit 
 You clap off and miss, we come back and start killin' shit 
 Catch us on the corner wearin black chinchilla shit 
 We organize discipline, plus we militant 
 (Verse 3: Tony Yayo) 
 (Weird intro by Yayo) 
 I'm in that coupe phantom, and the bodies kitted 
 Waves in my head, lookin' like tsunamis hit it 
 Niggas scheme, the infrared beam's on the mac 
 I put green on yo head like an Oakland A's hat 
 My boy was a dolja, now he a soulja 
 My lil' son ?? lettin off the ruger 
 In a whip mashed up, lookin' for his enemies 
 Ridin' and gassed up off double D batteries 
 Mass casualties, is hooked to them IV's 
 50 gimme the word, that's when I squeeze 
 Click clack, take that, fall back, it's a contract 
 50 grand, and 50 man
