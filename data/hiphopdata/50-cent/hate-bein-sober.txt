Damn I hate being sober, I'm a smoker 
 Fredo a drinker, Tadoe off molly water 
 We can't spell sober 
 Ballout roll up, when we roll up bitches be on us 
 All the hoes they love smoking, and love drinking 
 Anti-sober, for no reason 
 'Cause we can't spell sober 
 Ya know us, we smoke strong bruh 
 Watch me roll up 
 'Cause I can't spell sober 
 On my tour bus we get dumb high you's a floor boy 
 Fredo got a hangover he toting a Cobra 
 Last night he was shooting shit up like O-Dog 
 Reesy rollin', Tadoe got hoes on mollies 
 Chief Sosa, Ballout, we high riding 'Raris 
 My bitches love drinking, some love smoking 
 Let my alcoholic bitch hit the dutch, she start choking 
 Call up D-Money, now we throw money 
 All these bitches off the shits walk around like some zombies 
 Call up D-Money, now we throw money 
 All these bitches off the shits walk around like some zombies 
 Damn I hate being sober, I'm a smoker

 We got 100 pounds of this shit, my stash house with them bricks 
 My pockets filled with them stacks, my bitch be gone off a flat 
 She a hot tamale when she pop a molly, it's time to party, we party hard 
 Drink and smoke it, drink and smoke it, drink and smoke it, we high for sure 
 I came in back of that Rolls, nigga I ain't stuntin' them hoes 
 I trick a bitch to suck dick 
 Trick, what you spend on her, we spend on clothes 
 Too young for me she want Sosa, shooters in the Range Rover 
 That's GBE, when them two-two-threes get to flyin' bitch it's over 
 See my ring chain and my Rolex when I'm flexin' 
 Bitch I got to get mine, nigga get outta line, I check 'em 
 See this gangsta's shit done to perfection 
 Nigga better believe me, I make it look easy 
 Damn I hate being sober, I'm a smoker 
 Fredo a drinker, Tadoe off molly water

 Watch me roll up 
 'Cause I can't spell sober 
 My weed so strong, my cheese so long 
 Roll so many joints soon I might need a lung 
 Spend so many grands that I might need some bands 
 That's your bitch why she acting like she need a man? 
 I'm faded, talking mills 'cause I made it 
 Talking pounds 'cause I smoke it 
 Talking game 'cause I played it 
 I'm wasted, Rose that's my favorite 
 OG kush, you can taste it 
 Buying Cris' by the cases 
 I hate being sober 
 Don't smell no one smoking 
 Me and my niggas gon' roll up 
 Believe they gon' fire on you 
 You think you could roll up 
 You smoke by the ounce 
 Well bitch, I smoke by the pound 'cause 
 Damn I hate being sober, I'm a smoker 
 Fredo a drinker, Tadoe off molly water 
 We can't spell sober 
 Ballout roll up, when we roll up bitches be on us 
 All the hoes they love smoking, and love drinking
