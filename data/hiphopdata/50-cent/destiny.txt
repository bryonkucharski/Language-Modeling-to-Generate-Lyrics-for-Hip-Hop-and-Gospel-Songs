(Verse 1- 50 Cent) 
 I'm from city to city to shop the show 
 See me I been glidin' across the globe 
 I hustle hard to get the grib fa sho' 
 So when I make time to call you, you should pick up the phone 
 Tell me, what's on your mind when you're alone 
 Have ya touchin' on yourself, girl all in the zone 
 Now if I told you all 
 What things I say would I be wrong 
 Well then I wouldn't be right 
 Matter fact I'd be on the next flight 
 Tryna get it on with you tonight 
 Do the things you like 
 Touch the right spot, have ya piped and hot 
 While the wind blow through your hair in the drop 
 Just lay back, relax to the sounds of the sex 
 And let me to what I do until you climax 
 You can go straight to sleep after it's all over 
 In the mornin' roll over and we can start over
