 (Verse 1: Lloyd Banks) 
 We poppin' them bottles every time we pose and 
 Takin' planes to Atlanta where they throws them bows and 
 Pull up in Rovers baggin' the finest hos man 
 Takin' pictures with bitches in designer clothes and 
 Niggas schemin' cause everybody's neck is froze and 
 We comin' through stuntin' fuck it bow down to no man 
 Startin' trouble for no reason we up to no good 
 Playin' the block all season nigga I'm so hood 
 Holdin' it down 
 Bringin' pounds through the ghetto 
 Baguette it down rocks colored blue and yellow 
 We ruin marriages nigga ya lady mine 
 What farmer where vests on they P-89s? 
 Clear from the cops no time for no baby crimes 
 Pushin' them drops you know the Mercedes kind 
 The most hated 
 And anticipated 
 Since N.W.A. 
 Clear the way 
 (Chorus: 50 Cent & (Wacko)) 
 I got that trey pound with me now 
 (I got that nine with me) 
 Niggas know how I get down 
 (You want to grind with me) 
 20 inch chrome spin 
 (Come on and shine with me) 
 Let's get that money man 
 (Let's get that money man) 
 I got that trey pound with me now 
 (I got that nine with me) 
 Niggas know how I get down 
 (You want to grind with me) 
 20 inch chrome spin 
 (Come on and shine with me) 
 Let's get that money man 
 (Let's get that money man) 
 (Verse 2: Wacko) 
 What's the deal dog? do a nigga got to bash your face? 
 Get your shit bust up just to pass the day 
 I pull a fifth from my hip and let it blast away 
 And then three days later watch the pastor pray 
 God forbid 
 You don't know how hard it is 
 Me and my brother we didn't come up like no Cosby kids 
 We got together like "Man we got to rob these kids" 
 When the last time you looked off in mama's fridge? 
 Where's the mask? 
 Give it up where's the stash? 
 Yeah the dope all here but nigga where's the cash? 
 I got ya kid 
 And he ain't really got to live 
 Unless you got something that you really got to give 
 That's common sense 
 And I ain't been common since 
 I slipped up and made these same promises 
 Problem is: 
 I can't keep them 
 And we ain't even 
 And you get your son back when he ain't breathing 
 (Chorus: 50 Cent & (Wacko)) 
 I got that trey pound with me now 
 (I got that nine with me) 
 Niggas know how I get down 
 (You want to grind with me) 
 20 inch chrome spin 
 (Come on and shine with me) 
 Let's get that money man 
 (Let's get that money man) 
 I got that trey pound with me now 
 (I got that nine with me) 
 Niggas know how I get down 
 (You want to grind with me) 
 20 inch chrome spin 
 (Come on and shine with me) 
 Let's get that money man 
 (Let's get that money man) 
 (Verse 3: Skip) 
 Man fuck them other niggas 
 'Cause I'm down for my niggas 
 I'm about to blaze with the Mac and spit rounds for my niggas 
 Tear down for niggas 
 Make 'em drown for my niggas 
 Fuck it I touch white and brown for my niggas 
 Get in front of a judge and twist browns for my niggas 
 The raw slow I get bricks and pounds for my niggas 
 You the sound of a nigga 
 That's my round with a nigga 
 Juvenile sicker than beef by the pound with it nigga 
 Get ya town with it nigga 
 And it'll be all over 
 Come in here with gorillas dog all on ya 
 L-B- T-C- 6 and we the raw soldiers 
 Black shirts, black jeans, black kicks and all Rovers 
 No seeds, no sticks, no stems all Doja 
 Tec-9, Macs and Kays all toasters 
 Sprewells, weed to blaze no roasters 
 Pull up in the parking lot with no chaueffer 
 (Chorus: 50 Cent & (Wacko)) 
 I got that trey pound with me now 
 (I got that nine with me) 
 Niggas know how I get down 
 (You want to grind with me) 
 20 inch chrome spin 
 (Come on and shine with me) 
 Let's get that money man 
 (Let's get that money man) 
 I got that trey pound with me now 
 (I got that nine with me) 
 Niggas know how I get down 
 (You want to grind with me) 
 20 inch chrome spin 
 (Come on and shine with me) 
 Let's get that money man 
 (Let's get that money man)
