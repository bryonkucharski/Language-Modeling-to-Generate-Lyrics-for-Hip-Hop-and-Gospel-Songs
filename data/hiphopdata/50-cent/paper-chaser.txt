 I left a mark from here to Los Angeles 
 My neck wrist glamerous, my breakfast canabis!

 They could'ntcatch me with a knot in my shoe string. 
 And while were on the subject, check out my shoe game, 
 There's four G's on em; I cross seas on 'em! {DAMN! } 
 I'm alergic to snitches, I might sneeze on 'em 
 Put cheese on 'em - make everybody squeeze on 'em. (shot) 
 The white sheets on 'em - dirt and leaves on 'em 
 Concrete on em! - You concreep on 'em! . (echoes)
