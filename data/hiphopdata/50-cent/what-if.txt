Yeah 
 I'm fuckin' with this... 
 It's that classic shit... 
 That gangster shit... 
 Yeah... 
 Man I watch the sun go up and come down 
 Sayin'... what if? 
 Man I watch the tide roll in and roll out 
 Sayin'... what if? 
 Homie I play the block tryna get my packs off 
 Sayin'... what if? 
 Man if I get a shot, I can make it to the top 
 Damn... what if? 
 If I got on some pretty boy shit like Puffy 
 Niggaz in the hood man they jus wouldn't love me 
 If I wore a suit everyday like Jay-Z 
 Niggaz would think I bumped my fuckin' head and went crazy 
 If I put diamonds in my teeth like Baby 
 I wouldn't stand a chance of tryin' to sell like Shady 
 If I put out bullshit joints like AZ 
 Every chance niggaz get they try 'n' play me 
 But I move around with a lil 3.80 
 A nigga try to stunt, a nigga get sprayed B 
 If I smoke weed all day like Snoop do 
 I see the world different through my dialated pupils 
 If I buss dance moves on ya like Usher 
 Niggaz would say 50 that ain't gangster, fuck ya 
 Man ima just keep doin' what I do... 
 'Cause niggaz can't do me better than I do 
 Man I watch the sun go up and come down 
 Sayin'... what if? 
 Man I watch the tide roll in and roll out 
 Sayin'... what if? 
 Homie I play the block tryna get my packs off 
 Sayin'... what if? 
 Man if I get a shot, I can make it to the top 
 Damn... what if? 
 What if I had blockbuster slips like Will Smith 
 And all the backpack niggaz love me like Mos Def 
 I probably be a cool ass nigga like Ice Cube 
 Picture me in the flick right now lookin' so cool 
 What if I was a low-key nigga just laid back 
 Hustle to keep a homie around somebody to hold a gat 
 Man what if Halle Berry was my nex baby momz 
 Shit I get that child support up with no problem 
 If I caught a case and jump bail like ??get caught?? 
 'Cause I'm that nigga everybody know from New York 
 What if I was a new rap nigga you didn't know 
 You be sayin' damn that kid got a sick flow 
 But if I just cruise through your hood on 22's 
 Bumpin Curtis Mayfield and Marvin "So Smooth" 
 And if I let the top down on the Azure 
 Yeah that'd make you sick to your stomach, I'm sure 
 Man I watch the sun go up and come down 
 Sayin'... what if? 
 Man I watch the tide roll in and roll out 
 Sayin'... what if? 
 Homie I play the block tryna get my packs off 
 Sayin'... what if? 
 Man if I get a shot, I can make it to the top 
 Damn... what if?
