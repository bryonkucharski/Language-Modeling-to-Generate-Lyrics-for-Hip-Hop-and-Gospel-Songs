(Feat. 2pac) 
 Man we gotta go get something to eat man 
 I'm hungry as a motherfucker 
 Ay yo man, damn what's taking homie so long son? 
 50, calm down, here he come 
 Ah, oh, what the fuck!? 
 Ah! son, pull up! pull up! 
 Many men, wish death upon me 
 Blood in my eye dawg and I can't see 
 I'm trying to be what I'm destined to be 
 And niggas trying to take my life away 
 I put a hole in a nigga for fucking with me 
 My back on the wall, now you gon' see 
 Better watch how you talk, when you talk about me 
 'Cause I'll come and take your life away 
 Many men, many, many, many, many men 
 Wish death upon me 
 Lord I don't cry no more 
 Don't look to the sky no more 
 Have mercy on me 
 Now these pussy niggas putting money on my head 
 Go on and get your refund motherfucker, I ain't dead 
 I'm the diamond in the dirt, that ain't been found 
 I'm the underground king and I ain't been crowned 
 When I rhyme, something special happen every time 
 I'm the greatest, something like Ali in his prime 
 I walk the block with the bundles 
 I've been knocked on the humble 
 Swing the ox when I rumble 
 Show your ass what my gun do 
 Got a temper nigga, go'head, lose your head 
 Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs 
 I walk around gun on my waist, chip on my shoulder 
 Till I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over 
 Many men, many, many, many, many men 
 Wish death upon me 
 Lord I don't cry no more 
 Don't look to the sky no more 
 Have mercy on me 
 Have mercy on my soul 
 Somewhere my heart turned cold 
 Have mercy on many men 
 Many, many, many, many men 
 Wish death upon me 
 Our lifesytles be close caption 
 Addicted to fatal attraction 
 Pictures and actions be played back 
 In the mist of mashin' 
 No fairytales for this young black male 
 Some see me stranded in this land of Hell 
 Jail and crack cells 
 ???? Culture 
 Or the repercussion 
 While bustin' on back-stabbing vultures 
 Sellin' my soul 
 For material wishes 
 Fast cars and bitches 
 Wishin' I live my life a legend 
 Immortalized in pictures 
 Why shed tears, save your sympathy 
 My childhood years 
 Was spend burying my peers in the cemetery 
 Here's a message to the newborns 
 Waiting to breath: 
 "If you believe 
 You can achieve, just look at me" 
 Against all odds 
 Though life is hard, we carry on 
 Living in the projects 
 Broke with no lights on 
 To all the G's that follow me 
 Protect your essence 
 Born with less but your still precious 
 Just smile for me now 
 Many men, many, many, many, many men 
 Wish death upon me 
 Lord I don't cry no more 
 Don't look to the sky no more 
 Have mercy on me 
 Have mercy on my soul 
 Somewhere my heart turned cold 
 Have mercy on many men 
 Many, many, many, many men 
 Wish death upon me
