Yo, Red Spider 
 Is that 50 Cent and Pac ready? 
 Lemme know, holla 
 It's go'n be some stuff you go'n see 
 That's go'n make it hard to smile in the future 
 Yeah nigga, ha ha 
 Let's go nigga, dis is what it is 
 Tupac cut his head bald 
 Then you want to cut yo head bald 
 Tupac wear a bandana 
 You wanna wear a banadana 
 (What do we have here now?) 
 Tupac put a cross on his back 
 You wanna put crosses on yo back 
 Nigga, you ain't Tupac 
 Is it money and women, funny beginning's tragic ending's? 
 I can make a million and still not get enough of spendin' 
 And since my life is based on sinnin', I'm hell bound 
 Rather be buried that be worried, livin' held down 
 Yo, that shit is crazy Whoo Kid 
 Bring that muthafuckin' beat back man 
 It's go'n be some stuff you go'n see 
 That's go'n make it hard to smile in the future 
 Yeah nigga, ha ha 
 Let's go nigga, dis is what it is 
 Tupac cut his head bald 
 Then you want to cut yo head bald 
 Tupac wear a bandana 
 You wanna wear a banadana 
 (What do we have here now) 
 Tupac put a cross on his back 
 You wanna put crosses on yo back 
 Nigga, you ain't Tupac 
 Is it money and women, funny beginning's tragic ending's? 
 I can make a million and still not get enough of spendin' 
 And since my life is based on sinnin', I'm hell bound 
 Rather be buried that be worried, livin' held down 
 My game plan to be trained in 
 Military mind of a thug lord sittin' in a cemetery cryin' 
 I've been lost since my adolescence calling for Jesus 
 Ballin' as a youngster wondering if he see's us 
 Young black males 
 Crack sales got me three strikes 
 Livin' in jail this is hell enemies die 
 Wonder when we all pass, is anybody listnin'? 
 Got my hands on my semi shotty, everybody's snitchin' 
 Please God can you understand me, bless my family 
 Guide us all before we fall into insanity 
 I'm makin' a point to make my beatin' bumpin' raw life 
 Drop some shit to make these stupid bitches jaw tight 
 Till Makaveli return it's all eyes on me, on me 
 (What do we have here now?) 
 And you can hate it or love it 
 But that's what it's go'n be, go'n be 
 Shoulda listened, I told you not to fuck wit me, wit me 
 (What do we have here now?) 
 Now can you take the pressure 
 That's what we go'n see, go'n see 
 This is a cry for mercy, I promise 
 My success would be the death of you 
 Low and behold, you sold ya soul 
 There's nothing left of you 
 Look in the mirror, ask yourself, who are you? 
 If you don't know who you are 
 How could ya dreams come true? 
 Muthafucka, I sat backed and watched ya 
 You pretended to be Pac 
 You pretended to be hot but you not, now 
 (Now) 
 You sea-so crip, you can't take the pressure, you pussy 
 I warned you not to push me 
 You see me and chills, run up ya spine 
 God made menace in war but ya heart ain't like mine 
 And plus, they look at me like I'ma menace 
 I was playing wit guns, while ya momma had you 
 And yo friends playing tennis 
 I'ma nightmare, you see me in ya dream 
 Wake up and turn on ya TV, and see my ass again 
 You cowardly hearted, you couldn't make it on ya own 
 Fuck the source, I'm on the cover of Rollin' Stone 
 Till Makaveli return it's all eyes on me, on me 
 (What do we have here now?) 
 And you can hate it or love it 
 But that's what it's go'n be, go'n be 
 Shoulda listened, I told you not to fuck wit me, wit me 
 (What do we have here now?) 
 Now can you take the pressure 
 That's what we go'n see, go'n see 
 Till Makaveli return it's all eyes on me, on me 
 (What do we have here now?) 
 And you can hate it or love it 
 But that's what it's go'n be, go'n be 
 Shoulda listened, I told you not to fuck wit me, wit me 
 (What do we have here now?) 
 Now can you take the pressure 
 That's what we go'n see, go'n see
