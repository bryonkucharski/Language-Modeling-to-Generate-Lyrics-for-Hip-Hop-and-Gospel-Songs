Yeah, shady, aftermath 
 I guess, you didn't know 
 I be back for more 
 Everybody's on the floor 
 Goin', goin' outta control 
 Set it off on yo' left, dog 
 Set it off on yo' right, dog 
 Set it off 
 Nigga, I said set it off 
 (Set, set, set, set it off) 
 Sick with it, boy, better get with it, boy 
 In the club I get it goin', goin', uh 
 Just movin' to the music, it's on 
 And the sounds of 50 and D R E 
 Everything's calculated and sound precise 
 Another move another mill', let's get right, aight? 
 Success is my drug of choice, I'm high off life 
 Feelin' lucky enough to bet it all on the dice 
 Shorty, do what you wanna do, hit the dance floor 
 Move how you wanna move, later on 
 We can cruise if you wanna cruise, it's whatever you want 
 The fact is, I got more than I flaunt, yeah 
 I do my thang in the club 
 Every chance I get, I tear it up 
 Dance floor jampacked 
 Look I got 'em goin' goin' outta control 
 Set it off on yo' left, dog 
 Set it off on yo' right, dog 
 Set it off 
 Nigga, I said set it off 
 (Set, set, set, set it off) 
 System thumpin', dance floor jumpin' 
 We 30 deep in this bitch, we stuntin' 
 That's what you get, you in my hood 
 I thought you understood 
 You know me V.I.P., no ID 
 Bottles of DP, I do it real B I G 
 Bitches break their neck to be where I be 
 Take 'em to ecstasy, without ecstasy 
 I'm a chef, you need the hit I got the recipe 
 Doc got the antidote, it's in the drugs and the notes 
 Can you feel it? Em said for me to make you feel it 
 And remind you that you rockin' with the realest 
 I do my thang, in the club 
 Every chance I get, I tear it up 
 Dance floor jampacked 
 Look I got 'em goin' goin' outta control 
 Set it off on yo' left, dog 
 Set it off on yo' right, dog 
 Set it off 
 Nigga, I said set it off 
 (Set, set, set, set it off) 
 I'm hot boy, I'm burnin' up 
 I do my thang in the club with the burner tucked 
 Till the speakers all blown, we gon' turn it up 
 And do that damn thang, yeah, do that, mayne 
 Shorty, hit me high then hit me low 
 Get to poppin' and shakin' that thing on the flo' 
 A little dose of it, now I want some more 
 Nobody put that thang on me like that before 
 I be a fiend for it, it's the way you move 
 But I ain't payin' for it, 'cause I ain't no fool 
 If you okay with it, tonight I stay with it 
 Hit the telly play with it, in a major way get it 
 I do my thang, in the club 
 Every chance I get, I tear it up 
 Dance floor jampacked, look 
 I got 'em goin' goin' outta control 
 Set it off on yo' left, dog 
 Set it off on yo' right, dog 
 Set it off 
 Nigga, I said set it off 
 (Set, set, set, set it off)
