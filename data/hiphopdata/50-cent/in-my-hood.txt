Niggas screw they face up at me 
 On some real shit son they don't want beef 
 I cock that, aim that shit out the window 
 Spray till there ain't a shell left in my heat 
 Ya niggas better lay down, yeah I mean stay down 
 Get hit wit 8 round - ya ass ain't gonna make it 
 You niggas'll get laid out, yuh blood and ya brains out 
 Have ya on the concrete shiverin' and shakin' ... 
 I'm from Southside motherfucker 
 Where gats explode 
 If you feel like ya on fire, boy 
 Drop and roll 
 Niggas'll eatcha ass up till yuh heart turn cold 
 Now you could be a victim or you can lock and load 
 Party jumpin', shorty bouncin' that ass 
 I wanna fuck - Gimme a second, Ima holla 
 I'ma see what's up 
 I got my razor in my hand 
 My pistol in trunk 
 Carve ya ass up nicely if ya play me like a punk... 
 In my hoooooood 
 Niggas got love for me 
 But I don't go nowhere without my strap 
 In my hoooooood 
 A little dro, a lil hennessey 
 A nigga juz don't know how to act 
 In my hoooooood 
 Niggas is grimey 
 I stay on point 
 I hold to my gat 
 In my hoooooood 
 Niggas might buck at me 
 So I keep somethin' around to buck back 
 In my hoooooood 
 I don't trust a motherfuckin soul 
 When the D's come they fold 
 On my first case they told 
 Where I'm from it ain't safe to have more than a eighth 
 Niggas'll come to ya place, put a gun in ya face 
 Tell ya open the safe, as ya heart start to race 
 'Cause a robbery can turn into a homo-case 
 Cooperate a doc'll have to operate 
 B'cause I pop you run a light than pop at jake 
 Trust me son, niggas'll go hard for they cake 
 These thirsty niggas are lurkin 
 You have to catch 'em and merk em 
 I'm observant in my hood 
 These niggas be dummin 
 Shots go off at the dice game 
 All you see is them runnin' 
 That make it harder and harder to pump on the block 
 I'm a hustler, how the fuck am supposed to eat when its hot 
 In my hoooooood 
 Niggas got love for me 
 But I don't go nowhere without my strap 
 In my hoooooood 
 A little dro, a lil hennessey 
 A nigga juz don't know how to act 
 In my hoooooood 
 Niggas is grimey 
 I stay on point 
 I hold to my gat 
 In my hoooooood 
 Niggas might buck at me 
 So I keep somethin' around to buck back 
 In my hoooooood 
 The house party off the hook 
 Until them shots go off 
 Well that's what you get for stuntin on my block, show off 
 Uh, you shit outta luck if niggas catch you slippin 
 Crack money slow, so you know niggas is trippin' 
 Shorty down there on that Queens track 
 Takin' a whippin 
 Shit, b!tch get outta pocket - 
 She needs some discipline 
 Peep the feins shootin diesel in his arm in the alley 
 Look at the chrome spinners spinnin on that black Denali 
 The grimey niggas where I'm from don't wanna see you chipped up 
 You shine they gone jux you about to shoot ya whip up 
 It ain't good to do good in my hood 
 Blaaow ... You know not to do good now 
 In my hoooooood 
 Niggas got love for me 
 But I don't go nowhere without my strap 
 In my hoooooood 
 A little dro, a lil hennessey 
 A nigga juz don't know how to act 
 In my hoooooood 
 Niggas is grimey 
 I stay on point 
 I hold to my gat 
 In my hoooooood 
 Niggas might buck at me 
 So I keep somethin' around to buck back 
 In my hoooooood
