Hook - Joe: 
 They say this is a big rich town 
 I just come from the poorest pond 
 Bright lights, city life, I gotta make it 
 This is where it goes down 
 I just happen to come up hard 
 Legal or illegal baby I gotta make it 
 Verse 1 - 50 Cent: 
 I never took a straight path nowhere 
 Life's full of twist and turns 
 Bumps and bruises, I lived I learnt 
 I'm from that city full of yellow cabs and skyscrapers 
 It's hard to get a start in these ponds without paper 
 Homie I grew up in hell 
 A block away from heaven 
 That corner only 15 minutes away 
 It move a seven 
 Pure snow 
 Bag it then watch it go 
 Occupational options 
 Guess I'm blowing some hoes 
 Shoot the bullet, the strap 
 Learn to rap with a jack 
 Fuck it man in the mean time 
 Go ahead and pump a pack 
 This my regal royal flow 
 My James Bond bounce 
 That double 007, that 62 on my count 
 I'm a undercover liar, I lie under the covers 
 Look a bitch in the eye and tell her baby I love her 
 You're my inspiration 
 You're my motivation 
 You're the reason that I'm moving with no hesitation 
 Verse 2 - 50 Cent: 
 I gotta hustle through the hustle and bust while make a move 
 And move around the rats, wolves, I'm from the school 
 A hardknock 
 Shots pop 
 I just drop 
 Graveyard 
 Pick a block 
 Cause niggas watching spots 
 I'm tryna stash shit 
 Then I go legit 
 Hollow tip stuff 'em in clip case make niggas trip 
 My cocaine endeavours give me corporate ties 
 I'm supposed to lose watch me win against the odds 
 All I got it my word, balls and my instinct 
 We tryna make it 
 We already made it my friends think 
 We already on top 
 I gotta bigger plan 
 No more control, suffices or hand to hand 
 White collar visions 
 Game changing missions 
 Big wrists, big wins 
 Keep on bigger living 
 Perfect position 
 Watch me transition 
 From caterpillar to butterfly in the sky
