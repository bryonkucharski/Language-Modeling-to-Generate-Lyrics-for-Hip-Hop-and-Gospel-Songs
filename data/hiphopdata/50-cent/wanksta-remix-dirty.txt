Yeah, it's a problem, Flipmode nigga 
 We on the highest temperature level of the fucking pressure cooker 
 Blowing niggas tops, what? 
 Flipmode up in this bitch, The Rulership Movement nigga 
 Check it, let me talk, check it, check it 
 There's only one God sonny and there ain't no replacement 
 And anybody thinkin' different, just get locked in the basement 
 You know we had to touch the beat, 'cause the track is dope, nigga 
 And throw some bullet's at you the size of cantaloupes, nigga 
 A lotta niggas rollin' around like they can't get touched 
 Even the pope know to stay in bullet proof Benz trucks 
 Flipmode up in this bitch, ya niggas know we on fire 
 We hang niggas like old sneakers from telephone wires 
 Puerto Rican mami's call me Papi 
 'Cause they see me in the hood, poppin' wheelies on my Kawasaki 
 Yo, they can't stop me, Ramp yo, I'm kinda cocky 
 I'll break your fucking ribs like I'm playing ice hockey 
 Bigger than life, extort the game, critically acclaimed 
 Smack you in your face with my chain 
 Now I'm ready to go to war like Saddam Hussein 
 Everybody in the industry know my squad's name 
 Yo, we just an idiot and we here to merge somethin' 
 You know what chu dealing with, you know we here to hurt somethin' 
 So stop with the stupid shit, 'cause it ain't even worth frontin' 
 Hope you know that you could really end up in the Earth cuzin' 
 We do this all the time, right now we on the grind 
 So hurry up and cop and go selling nicks and dimes 
 Shorty she's so fine, I gotta make her mine 
 A ass like dat gotta be one of a kind 
 I crush 'em every time, punch 'em with every line 
 I'm fuckin' with they mind, I make 'em press rewind 
 They know they can't shine if I'm around the rhyme 
 Been on parole since ninety four, 'cause I commit the crime 
 I say you on my line, I did it three ta nine 
 If D's ran up in my crib, you know who droppin' dimes 
 You say you a gangsta but you neva pop nuttin' 
 We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin' 
 You go to the dealership but you neva cop nuttin' 
 You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nuttin' 
 I know your man, he says that you the bitch stuntin' 
 You don't know how the gun cock to reach somethin' 
 Yeah, I see ya face in ya grill 
 But it's your conscience itchin' to tell you the squad love a mil 
 Like a forest field, we hunt ta god, it's surreal 
 Flipmode, cop boy, get your weight up for real, get at 'em 
 Yo, we just an idiot and we here to merge somethin' 
 You know what chu dealing with, you know we here to hurt somethin' 
 So stop with the stupid shit, 'cause it ain't even worth frontin' 
 Hope you know that you could really end up in the Earth cuzin' 
 We do this all the time, right now we on the grind 
 So hurry up and cop and go selling nicks and dimes 
 You say you a gangsta but you neva pop nuttin' 
 We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin' 
 You go to the dealership but you neva cop nuttin' 
 You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nuttin'

 Nigga you play wit my paper, you gon meet my berretta 
 Now shorty think I'ma sweat her, sippin' on amoretta 
 I'm hit once than dead, I know I can do betta 
 She look good but I know she after my cheddar 
 She tryna get in my pockets homie and I ain't gon let her 
 Be easy, start some bullshit ya get your whole crew wet 
 We in the club doin' the same ol' two step 
 Guerrilla Unit, 'cause, they say we bugged out 
 'Cause we don't go nowhere without toast, we thugged out 
 You say you a gangsta but you neva pop nuttin' 
 We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin' 
 You go to the dealership but you neva cop nuttin' 
 You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nuttin' 
 You say you a gangsta but you neva pop nuttin' 
 We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin' 
 You go to the dealership but you neva cop nuttin' 
 You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nuttin'
