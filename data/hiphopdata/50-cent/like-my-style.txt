 On your mark, get set, lets go 
 Switch the flow teach ya how to turn Yayo into Dough 
 The original dan-dadda 
 Nobody bum harder 
 You heard what I said boy I'm hot I'm hot! 
 You hoodrats, they say "He is so crazy" 
 It's not just they say "He tried to spray me" 
 But that's what you get for tryna play me 
 The aftermath on my rap is so shady! 
 No matter how you try you can't stop this 
 I'll catch you stuntin relently crew cockpit 
 If you a pimp why your hoes stay out your pocket? 
 Fine find out how my P-40 glock is 
 (Tony Yayo)

 Niggaz lipsynce the lyrics 'cause they wanna be us 
 Groupy hoes from the hood they be tryna G us 
 Tryna holla at the kid errytime they see us 
 Girlfriend quit pretendin I'm the nigga you lovin' 
 And I ain't got to say nuttin' you know that I'm thuggin' 
 Put my hands on that ass seein you say that I'm buggin 
 "We family baby", kissin' cousins 
 Now look with the riff-raff done druggin 
 For the G's my degrees is hotter than your oven
