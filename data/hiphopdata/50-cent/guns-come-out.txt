 (What, what, y'all niggas know what I'm about) 
 Y'all niggas know 
 Find me at my do' when the gunz come out 
 Y'all niggas know 
 (What, what, y'all niggas know what I'm about) 
 Y'all niggas know 
 Find me at my do' when the gunz come out 
 I do this all the time, stuck with a little shine 
 Walk with a little nine, 'case I get in a bind 
 They say I'm fuckin' crazy, they think I'm out my mind 
 'Cause I'm down to bust a nigga head all the time 
 Now you know the hoes, they know how I roll 
 In that new Rolls with the suicide doors 
 22 inch chrome, a nigga money low 
 You try to touch me, I put out, ya get ya brains blown 
 You go against the grain, pussy and you on ya own 
 You right there in my zone, welcome to the terridome 
 The ice blowin' my chain, blood blow in my veins 
 Blue still in the range, I'm doin' my thang 
 The semi auto spray, run if you get away 
 I'll find your whereabouts and clap at you another day 
 Nigga play with the bread, get a hole in ya head 
 You touch a dime of mine thug and your ass dead 
 Y'all niggas know 
 (What, what, y'all niggas know what I'm about) 
 Y'all niggas know 
 Find me at my do' when the gunz come out 
 Y'all niggas know 
 (What, what, y'all niggas know what I'm about) 
 Y'all niggas know 
 Find me at my do' when the gunz come out 
 In the hood, hoopty, hate low, niggas don't know I'm around 
 Hop out, hit 'em up, lay my murder game down 
 You see me in ya projects, 187's in progress 
 Hard niggas finna' soften up when that lead touch 'em 
 You cut 'em once and keep fight, fuck it just keep cuttin' em 
 It's real killa instinct, kill or be killed 
 Trust me, you don't wanna feel how hollow tips feel 
 Fuck around and get ya cap peeled 
 Nigga you know the drill, Brownsville 
 Flat bush, ground heights, Brooklyn Zoo 
 Feed the wolves, they eat the food 
 And they [unverified] fathom too 
 Nigga welcome to the jungle, New York, New York 
 Gangstas who signed [unverified] actually let their guns talk 
 I'm cool with some bloods, I'm cool with some crippes 
 I'm cool but if there's a problem, nigga, I got extra clips 
 I don't know karate, but I split the bricks 
 I don't love 'em loverboy, we the shit bitch 
 Y'all niggas know

 Y'all niggas know 
 (What, what, y'all niggas know what I'm about) 
 Y'all niggas know 
 Find me at my do' when the gunz come out 
 I'll come through and touch ya, walk out then cut ya 
 In case your dumbass wanna tussle 
 AR-15, co-exist to make the shell case muffle 
 Scope, [unverified] run you're still dead 
 Hit your calf, hit your ass, hit ya back, then your head 
 Contract killa, murder for the scrilla 
 Search, find a nigga, run up behind a nigga 
 Shoot car windows out to flatline a nigga 
 Gun pop, heart stop, homie this is heavy 
 You on your way to meet your maker, nigga are you ready 
 No exception to the rule, death is promised 
 Plus I just bought my niggas new macs and llamas 
 Got respect for you, [unverified] I will 'comodate you 
 One phone call and niggas will exterminate you 
 No future fuckin' with me, there's no tomorrow 
 Niggas'll run up on you tonight and hit ya the hardest
