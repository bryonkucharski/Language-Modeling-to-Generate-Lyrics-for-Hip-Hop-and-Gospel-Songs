I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris 
 Tanqueray and Alize, I don't need shit 
 Nigga I'm high all the time, I smoke that good shit 
 I stay high all the time, man I'm on some hood shit 
 Give me some dro, purple haze and some chjocolate 
 Give me a dutch and a lighter I'll spark shit 
 And stay high all the time, I smoke that good shit 
 I'm high all the time, man I'm on some hood shit 
 Everytime I Roll up niggas holla ROLL up and I tell 'em HOLD up 
 U ain't gettin' money you ain't smokin' 
 In my Benzo 20 inch Lorenzos smokin' on indo 
 Hiigh as a muthaf***a 
 I be on them backstreets niggas know I clap heat only if you got beef 
 Man you better holla at me 
 Niggas get locked up stabbedup shot up 
 Everytime I pop up a lot goin' on in my hood 
 I shoot the dice holler get 'em girls 
 Daddy need new shoes 
 Daddy need Perelli's to look mean on 22s 
 Stash box X box fax machine phone 
 Bullet proof this b****h and iam gone 
 2003 Surban swerving, too many sips of henny 
 The D's sick they searched the whip and they can't find the semis 
 They was just harassing me 'cause they know who I was 
 Spent da night in central Booking for smoking some bud 
 Now if you heard I done started some shit 
 It ain't becuz I be high (I be high I be high) 
 And if you heard I done let off a clip 
 It ain't becuz I be high (I be high ibe high) 
 But I twist that la la la la 
 I get high as I wanna nigga 
 Go agaianst me fa sho you's a goner nigga 
 I don't smoke to calm my nerves but I got beef 
 Finna crush my enemies like I crush the hashish 
 If you love me tell me you love, stare at me man 
 I'd hate to be in the benz clappin 1 of my fans 
 Let me show you how to greet me when you meet me when you see me 
 IF you real my nigga you know how to holla"G-UNIT" 
 There's no competition its just me 
 50cent, muthaf***a, Iam hot on these streets 
 If David could go against Goliath with a stone 
 I can go at Nas and Jigga, both for the throne 
 NOw who you know besides me who writte lines and squeeze nines 
 And have hoes in the hood sniffin on white lines 
 U don't want me to be your kids role model 
 I'll teach them how to them 380s and load up them hollows 
 Have shorty fresh off the stoop, ready to shoot 
 Big blunt in his mouth, deuce deuce in his boot 
 Sit in the crib, sippin Ginness, watchin Menace 
 Then Oh Lord, have yong nigg bucking shit like he O-DOG 
 My team they depend on me when its crunch time 
 I eat a nigga food in broad day like its lunch time 
 U feelin' brave nigga? go ahead get gully 
 See if I don't leave yor bain leaking up out your skully
