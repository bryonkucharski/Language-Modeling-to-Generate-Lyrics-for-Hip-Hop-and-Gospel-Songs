Yeah 
 Let's take'em back 
 Coming up I was confused 
 My mama kissing a girl 
 Confusion occurs 
 Coming up in a cold world 
 Daddy ain't around 
 Probably out committing felonies 
 My favorite rapper used to sing 
 Check, check out my melody 
 I wanna live good so shit I sell dope 
 For a four-finger ring 
 One of them gold ropes 
 Nana told me if I passed I get a sheep skin coat 
 If I could move a few packs 
 I get the hat 
 Now that'll be dope 
 Tossed and turn in my sleep that night 
 Woke up the next morning 
 Niggaz done stole my bike 
 Different day, same shit 
 Ain't nothing good in the hood 
 I run away from this bitch 
 And never come back if I could 
 (50 Cent) 
 Hate it or love it the under dog's on top 
 And I'm gon shine homie until my heart stop 
 (The Game) 
 Go'head'n envy me 
 I'm rap's MVP 
 And I ain't going no where 
 So you can get to know me 
 (50 Cent) 
 Hate it or love it the under dog's on top 
 And I'm gon shine homie until my heart stop 
 (The Game) 
 Go'head'n envy me 
 I'm rap's MVP 
 And I ain't going no where 
 So you can get to know me 
 G-G-G-G-G-G-G-Unit 
 (Game) 
 On the grill of ma low rider 
 Guns on both sides 
 Right above the gold wires I four-five'em 
 Kill a nigga on ma song 
 And really do it 
 That's the true meaning of a ghostwriter 
 Ten g'z will take your daughter outta air forces 
 Believe you me homie, I know all about losses 
 I'm from Compton, where the wrong colors, be cautious 
 One phone call, have your body dumped in Marcy 
 I stay strapped like car seats 
 Been banging since ma lil' nigga, rob, got killed for his Barkley's 
 That's ten years 
 I told Pooh in '95 
 I'll kill you if you try me for my air-max 95's 
 Told Banks when I met'em I'm a ride 
 And if I gotta die, rather homicide 
 I ain't had 50 cent when ma grand-mama died 
 Now I'm going back to Cali with ma jacob on 
 See how time fly? 
 (50 Cent) 
 Hate it or love it the under dog's on top 
 And I'm gon shine homie until my heart stop 
 (The Game) 
 Go'head'n envy me 
 I'm rap's MVP 
 And I ain't going no where 
 So you can get to know me 
 (50 Cent) 
 Hate it or love it the under dog's on top

 (50 Cent) 
 From the beginning to the end 
 Losers lose, winners win 
 This is real we ain't gotta pretend 
 The cold world that we in 
 It's full of pressure and pain 
 Enough of me nigga now listen to Game 
 (Game) 
 Used to see 5-0 throw the crack by the bench 
 Now I'm fucking with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense 
 My Ma's happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent 
 And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz 
 Waiting on Sha Money to land sitting in the range 
 Thinking how they spend 30 million dollars on airplanes 
 When there's kids starving 
 Pac is gone, and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage 
 I wanna know what's going on like I hear Marvin 
 No school books 
 They use their wood to build coffins 
 Whenever I'm in a booth 
 And I get exhausted 
 I think what if Marie Baker got that abortion 
 I love you Ma 
 (50 Cent) 
 Hate it or love it the under dog's on top 
 And I'm gon shine homie until my heart stop 
 (The Game) 
 Go'head'n envy me 
 I'm rap's MVP 
 And I ain't going no where 
 So you can get to know me
