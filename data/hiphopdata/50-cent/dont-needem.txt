Yeah, it is what it is man 
 Sirens flashin', you know the routine, the crime scene taped off 
 It started off a robbery, they blew half his face off 
 They seen him shinin', course full of diamonds he bought 
 Grindin', his foot slipped off the ladder of success he was climbin' 
 The D's came through, asked the niggas if they knew what happened 
 Somehow my name end up in anything that involves clappin' 
 Detectives at my mama crib, they say they wanna question me 
 They put me in a line up last time and they arrested me 
 When it come to cookin' coke, they know I got the recipe 
 I turn a quarter to a half, that's why they mess with me 
 I'm the neighborhood pusher, I move packs to make stacks 
 A little weed, a little X, a little H, little crack 
 Figure, I push it to the limit, take this shit to the max 
 Navy blue vest on, navy blue Yankee hat 
 Calm, in my palm, fully loaded fire arm 
 First to let off, last to run, every time it's on 
 I tell niggas to suck my dick 
 Get the fuck out my face 
 'Cause, I don't need 'em 
 'Cause, they're never around 
 When I'm down, shot and I'm bleedin' 
 What, niggas yeah 
 Is there a mothafuckin' problem nigga 
 Oh, yeah 
 That's what I thought so, pussy 
 Niggas be talkin' about me, they always callin' me crazy 
 Fuck them O.G. niggas, they stuck in the eighties 
 Sayin' they gonna do me somethin', like now you know that's a lie 
 Nigga you look at me wrong, I'll let that hammer fly 
 I'm rich, I still wake up with crime on my mind 
 Queen's nigga put it down like Pappy Mason in his prime 
 When I say move, nigga move or get caught in the cross fire 
 Up a fence runnin', cut my fuckin' hand on a barb wire 
 Shit's crazy, just a different day, it's the same shit 
 Hollow tip part in ya head, leave ya whole fuckin' brain split 
 They sit, they see me in the Aston Martin 
 What's the matter, they can't get that hoopty started 
 Thought they was grindin', well goddamn where that money at 
 Thought you was fucked 
 'Cause, you was lettin' paper stack 
 You ain't a hustler, matter of fact, you's a busta 
 I don't trust ya, I shoulda sent niggas to touch ya 
 I tell niggas to suck my dick 
 Get the fuck out my face 
 'Cause, I don't need 'em 
 'Cause, they're never around 
 When I'm down, shot and I'm bleedin' 
 What? 
 Who said they gonna do somethin' to me 
 You must be out your rabbid ass mind 
 Fuck around and kill one of these niggas
