Put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up 
 Put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up 
 (50 Cent (Lloyd Banks)) 
 Hands up shorty when you party with me, we goin' way past quarter to three (I said Hands Up!) 
 I'm good in the V.I.P. I got my hammer right here with me (I said Hands Up!) 
 You know when you party with crooks, you gotta learn to respect the jooks (I said Hands Up!) 
 Everything ain't cruise to fame, this shit ain't sweet as it looks (I said Hands Up!) 
 (Lloyd Banks (50 Cent)) 
 You know I'm puttin' something on me right before I leave outta the car (Put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em 
 Up, put 'em up We came to party) 
 You don't tough talkin' at me you gon' leave outta the club with a star (Put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em 
 Up, put 'em up We came to party) 
 We pop bottles like it's all free fo' I leave I'ma buy out the bar (Put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up, 
 Put 'em up We came to party) 
 You can order what you want it's on me I'm a G take a look at star (Put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up, 
 Put 'em up We came to party) 
 (Verse 1: Lloyd Banks) 
 It feels so good to live sucker free 
 I'm soakin' it all up while your girl suckin' me 
 It mean the world to her, it's nothing but a nut to me 
 Look miss, get a grip and let a motherfucker be 
 I'm a rap star 
 Who wants to be ridin' around in that car 
 Two in the front and the back got the plasma 
 This ain't a free ride you gotta have the gas ma 
 I wouldn't buy a chick a pump that got asthma 
 And I'm busy so I move a bit faster 
 You can't tell me yes if I don't ask ya 
 Haha I'm a bastard 
 Damn near showin' his hand over the plastic 
 'Cause they wanna see your man go in the casket 
 Rule number one keep your gun and get your ass hit that's it 
 Lights off and your body's stiff 
 By the same niggas you used to party with

 I cruise through the strip 
 22's on the whip 
 New rule: gonna hit 
 Thousand dollar outfit 
 Never snooze never slip 
 Follow rules or get whip 
 Nigga move or get hit 
 I don't care who's on the strip 
 It ain't only the Ferrari now the jewels got him sick 
 Now it's 2006 I need a new bottom miss 
 It's aight they can talk I'm amused by the pricks 
 I'm the news out the bricks nigga who's hot as this 
 I bet the mansion and the swimming pool got 'em pissed 
 I ain't a cuddler I fuck the drool outta chick 
 My niggas ice grill but it ain't the same 
 They don't see the faces they don't see the chains 
 Like Ooh when you get 'em they don't know you with me 
 They probably think the bouncers at the front door frisk me 
 This is regular shit the erryday mentality 
 They charged up don't make me put in the battery
