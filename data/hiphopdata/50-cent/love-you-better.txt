 But you never thought you'd meet a girl quite like me (like me) 
 I like the ball 
 I'll take you out 
 Buy out the mall 
 You never thought you'd meet a girl quite like me 
 I own them all 
 The cribs and cars 
 I'm a superstar 
 Anything you want 
 Boy you know I got it 
 Put you on a plane 
 Go somewhere exotic 
 Take you all around the world 
 Fulfill your fantasies 
 I can make you love 
 I'll be everything you need 
 That's your girlfriend, yeah whatever 
 I know I can love you better 
 She's not special 
 I just met her 
 I know I can love you better 
 You don't look too happy at all 
 You need me in your life you should call 
 I'll save you 
 Baby you should let me be here for you

 You're the boy that I'd been pursuing 
 I want you bad 
 I'll be the girl 
 You never had 
 Pardon me if I seem too aggressive (I'm sorry) 
 I know you want me too 
 I'll make you love me 
 I'll spoil you too 
 Anything you want 
 Boy you know I got it 
 Put you on a plane 
 Go somewhere exotic 
 Take you all around the world 
 Fulfill your fantasies 
 I can make you love me 
 I'll be everything you need 
 That's your girlfriend, yeah whatever
