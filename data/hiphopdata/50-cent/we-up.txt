Yeah, Uh huh 
 I'm round the bullshit like a matador 
 I'm used to the bullshit, it don't matter, boy 
 Corporate acquisitions, accumulations of wealth 
 Build with the gods and double knowledge of self 
 Entrepreneur visions, Moulin Rouge religion 
 That pussy make a weak nigga break down 
 So what you want, the cheese or the cheeks? 
 You want the cheeks but she want the cheese 
 A bitch gotta eat 
 I'm havin' the epiphany you niggas ain't shit to me 
 Worse than the scum in the slum I'm from 
 I'm a southside nigga, yeah I'm 'bout mine 
 You be that next nigga corners come outline 
 You ain't made of what I'm made of 
 You a bum nigga with a bum bitch 
 Who's shoes come from Bakers 
 Counterfeit, fraudulent fakers 
 What kind of rich nigga bitch look like that? 
 Y'all know when we pullin' off the lot 
 Brake, hit the button, then we pullin' down the top 
 Shine's on stuntin' and I'm pullin' out a knot 
 Strapped with the Glock, won't pull it out a lot but front, I'll make it pop 
 You don't do it how we do 
 Niggas ain't own the shit we own 
 Everything new 
 Spikes on the Louis Vuittons (Vuittons, Vuittons) 
 We up, nigga 
 Visualize everything I needed and dream (uh-huh) 
 Penalized every ho nigga that have a scheme (what else?) 
 Guns in your video get you locked in tha' bing 
 Yeah, I kill a nigga quick, no worries, my record clean 
 Murder one become manslaughter as soon as they brought up 
 Charity work, parking tickets and no charges 
 Fuck nigga you fucked over your father, when he gave you a dick should have been a bitch in pajamas 
 I made my first million fucking dollars 
 Bought a Bible, oh yeah, God got me 
 Made my second million dollars, bought a chopper and binocular 
 I'm scared, this shit don't happens to everybody 
 I'm on Instagram looking at your favorite singer 
 Debating on should I fuck, or jump on her single 
 20 thou, she got a hell of a adlib 
 I'm in her mouth like I knew I could have kids, K-Dot 
 Y'all know when we pullin' off the lot 
 Brake, hit the button, then we pullin' down the top 
 Shine's on stuntin' and I'm pullin' out a knot 
 Strapped with the Glock, won't pull it out a lot but front, I'll make it pop 
 You don't do it how we do 
 Niggas ain't own the shit we own 
 Everything new 
 Spikes on the Louis Vuittons (Vuittons, Vuittons) 
 We up, nigga 
 'Round the world tourin', the city got borin' 
 Bury me a G with a new pair of Jordans 
 Coupe foreign, top peeled like an orange 
 Blue Ferrari, so many iron horses 
 Living life with no worries 
 My gun got a Zodiac sign, it's a Taurus 
 Don't make it slam on you like Amar'e 
 M'zone, Rida gang, end of story 
 Oops that's your baby, my bad, I'm sorry 
 She call me daddy too, we should be on Maury 
 Everything you aren't, fly nigga soaring 
 Purple label Ralph Lauren, kick game like Atari 
 You so special, bedroom or restroom 
 Just keep performing, Go girl 
 About to film a movie, guess who it's starring? 
 Y'all know when we pullin' off the lot 
 Brake, hit the button, then we pullin' down the top 
 Shine's on stuntin', and I'm pullin' out a knot 
 Strapped with the Glock, won't pull it out a lot but front, I'll make it pop 
 You don't do it how we do 
 Niggas ain't own the shit we own 
 Everything new 
 Spikes on the Louis Vuittons (Vuittons, Vuittons) 
 We up, nigga 
 Good pussy for dinner or bomb kush for breakfast 
 D'D-Deep-colored VS stones around my neck bitch 
 Feels like a nigga dreamin' (dreamin'), feels like a nigga dreamin' (dreamin')
