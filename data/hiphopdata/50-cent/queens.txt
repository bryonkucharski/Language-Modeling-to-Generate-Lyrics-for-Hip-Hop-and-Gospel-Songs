Hit that nigga, man, fuck these niggas 
 Straight up, all y'all niggas, yo, yo 
 Queens got the vets 
 (Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens) 
 Queens be the best 
 (Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens) 
 Queens take ya heads 
 (Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens) 
 Queens be the vets 
 (Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens) 
 I'm here to crack ya cats' skulls open 
 Fuck ya head up more than that bullshit ya smokin' 
 Niggas buzz you in the door but I blew it open 
 Ya rhymes is trash that verse ain't worth a token 
 Try to hop this, monotonous, murderous thoughts 
 When I'm plottin' this, overthrow the government 
 Burn the whole metropolis, lyrical warfare 
 Hip-hop Apocalypse, strap devils to the chairs 
 Start shockin' shit, Q you, I chew through 
 We could battle in the projects and give or take the clue 
 Flex could get one too, the wait, I'm supplyin' 
 My crew pop, they iron from HTM to the peaks of Mount Zion 
 I'm ready for the showdown 
 Mention my name, cowboy, watch it go down 
 I blow through your clique like Hurricane Floyd 
 Keep rappers paranoid, kept your bodies in the game 
 Is something I can't avoid, shit get tricky like Siegfried and Roy 
 I seek and destroy 
 Queens got the vets

 I'ma blaze y'all niggas and represent Queens 
 Run up in ya cribs, fill ya tubs with gasoline 
 Smash ya plaques, tie ya arms back 
 What's ya worse nightmare, Black? I'm beyond that 
 The mic, how I strike it, got 'em dialin' psychics 
 Roll with minds, don't give a fuck if you don't like it 
 With niggas that's invited without recited, ignited 
 It burn mad slow and that's why I'll easily light it 
 Me and the ghettos reunited, all the broads is excited 
 Your ass looks stupid, tryna fight it 
 You wanna get your ass smacked up 
 So you can dig into the stash that I stacked up 
 But when my Queens, niggas flashed then you backed up 
 Keep my dogs fed, so they can shit when niggas act up 
 It's the L, nigga, dot com, dot hot lead red dot on your head be 
 And the rappers you idolized that idolized me 
 I walk in the spot, niggas part like the Red Sea 
 And Todd's Shop of Horrors, we battle to the death tonight 
 There's no tomorrow, I'm out for revenge 
 Like the rebels in Nicaragua but I can take it farther 
 Travel back in time, fill ya baby bottle with lava 
 Queens got the vets

 This is how we put it down, this is Veteran's Day 
 We work hard so we can play hard and push them big things 
 Persistent, we keep comin' like some nigs 
 Droppin' albums, every few years we rich 
 We the best, we the vets 
 We do this for the love, we thirst for that street shit 
 It's P, nigga, check my record, it's flawless 
 Do the knowledge to the chorus, yeah you fuckin' right 
 While I was raised on my fuckin' life 
 I did my time on them corners, now I lead the fuckin' life 
 Large dollars, guns and ice 
 Is nothin' you know my weight and the price of it 
 You know how the Q dogs do cousin 
 We don't follow trends, we set those so get up on it 
 Queens got the vets 
 (Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens) 
 Queens be the best 
 (Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens) 
 Queens take ya heads
