 It ain't good to good in front of niggas in the hood, right. 
 It ain't good to good in front of niggas in the hood, right. 
 Everybody know that 
 Doin' good in front of niggas in the hood cause problems 
 Tre, trade pounds and (?) 
 I hate when hoes get on some loudmouth shit 
 Your man gangsta? Me too 
 Go on and get 'em bitch 
 I just bought new toast to spit 
 Next nigga gettin' gully gettin' laid out quick 
 Where ever rich touchin niggas is gettin' hurt 
 Cause a broke nigga always down to put it in work 
 Don't run up on me, I don't know you nigga 
 So what you bought my CD, I don't owe you nigga 
 I know you love the way the goutti beat bump 
 Got you license plate rounds and all over your trunk 
 Don't confuse these trucks with my style dog 
 I'm from Queens but I'm mother fuckin' B.K. hard 
 I sound like I move bricks uptown 
 More like a thug from the Bronx who stay with a 4 pound 
 Shook nigga (shook nigga, shook nigga) 
 I'm a Guinness Book nigga 
 We don't play that pussy shit round here 
 You can get your fuckin' wig split down here 
 Don't rep where you come from too much around here 
 You can get your fuckin' cap filt 
 If I can't get my gun in the club, why whould I come in the club 
 So them niggas I done stuck up could cut me he fuck up, nah 
 I'm outside to jump off in a benz jeep 
 4 deep strapped with all kinds of heat 
 Niggas think they want beef 
 They don't want beef 
 They find from somebody that love playin' in the street 
 When you rap, keep it gangsta dog it's all good 
 Just don't go coppin that shyt in the wrong hood 
 But I'm from the young boy, come and try ya nigga 
 Shell will make ya feel like your on fire nigga 
 If you thinkin' we thristy 'cause, we right 
 We lookin' at your watch and chain like that's a S-type 
 Murder sayin' don't play 50 in the club 
 Last time it came nigga tore the shyt up (what) 
 I don't where you from and I don't care 
 But nigga we don't play that pussy shit round here 
 (Spanish talkin') 
 No ingles, No ingles, mother fuckers will shoot ya 
 The Latin Kings don't like me, I don't care 
 We don't talk that mida mida bullshit round here 
 Man, I done so much dirt in the hood 
 Niggas heard I got shot they was all sayin' good (do it for em) 
 Fuck y'all, ya ain't got to like me 
 I'm gettin' knocked, y'all nigga ain't got to like me 
 I'm on the same bullshit I been on 
 It's the same bullshit ya niggas need to get on 
 Ya shit sound too commercial 
 Come cruisin through the hood mother fuckers will hurt ya 
 You shouldn't them flash jewels 
 Cause niggas will run up on ya if that's true 
 They want your money, the watch, and you tenis shos 
 I ain't gotta tell ya not to move 
 Ya know the rules
