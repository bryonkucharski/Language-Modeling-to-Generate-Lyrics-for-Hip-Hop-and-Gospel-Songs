 Gun in the stash box 
 Get ya bitch ass shot stuntin around here (here) 
 Flow so hot 
 They say I got it locked 
 Hold on a second homie, let's get this clear 
 Look the wrist stay rocked 
 The Ruger stay cocked 
 I hope ya smoke alot 'cause I supply the weed spot 
 Got a few questions and I need the answer on the spot 
 That bitch you wit, she like you or she like what she got? 
 Tryin' to maintain 
 Tearin niggas out the frame 
 Semi automatic flows 
 You know how it goes

 Gun in hand 
 Understand gettin' money is the plan 
 Gerth Street is my man

 Call me the unemployment office, cause a nigga got that work 
 Niggas stavin on the other side I lock they turf 
 If ya funkin' you don't wanna get popped at first 
 Cause ya might end up bein locked in that hearse 
 I'm a veteran and you'ze an amateur kid 
 I'll fuck ya bitch and video tape it like Tommy and Pamela did 
 We put the icing on the cake and we covered the spread 
 You fuck with me or my niggas you'll be covered in red 
 That's like when them young niggas smothered that kid 
 Niggas snitched on eachother now they both doin' a bid 
 Dumbass niggas you supposed to have ya allibi straight 
 When ya gettin' interogatted you supposed to keep a straight face 
 I keep it gangsta for my niggas up in Cali 
 We sit on 23 inch spinners up in the alley 
 We smoke on dro from Texas to the NY 
 Ten niggas with me that mean ten niggas with ten knives 
 Nigga 
 (Chorus: 50 Cent)

 (Verse 3: Lloyd Banks) 
 Its on now time to cut the cake 
 Fuck the jake tuck the plate 
 Nigga move dump the eight 
 Guaranteed to pump his brakes 
 To pissy drunk the case ain't got a month to waste 
 Smile with a pumpkin face 
 Deep enough to jump the states 
 Stuff you in the trunk escape 
 You want a problem? 
 Fuck the Bapes, up the stakes 
 Everything I wear is up to date 
 Loyal cat, guaranteed my son'll be a spoiled brat 
 Hot enough to boil crack 
 M-5 all you black 
 I'm the reason all you rap 
 Admit it I'm Daddy Black 
 Doin' this since Caddy Shack 
 With Gurth Street In that Caddy Lac 
 Blowin' out a pillow pack 
 I call it "Coffee Brown" 
 Bitches can't get off me now 
 Rasta man toss me pounds 
 I ain't from a softy town 
 Niggas'll brake ya bones, crack ya face 
 Call the doctor let him put it back in place 
 (Talking: 50 Cent)
