 Waitin' at your door (What up bitches) (Verse 2) Comin' up I ain't had much

 But I wanted a drop So you know 
 I had to make somethin' out of nothin' (Yeah) Like turn an empty spot 
 Into a crack spot pumpin' (woo) The older niggas really wasn't feelin' the kid Also hard at 19 
 I bought a Benz I did But you can't hustle a hustler 
 I peeped in a sled Tried to find out where I lived 
 So they could run in my crib In 6 months 
 I sold a million gold tops on got brew Back then niggas yousta call me boo Country came around 
 Ease it and clappin' then Country left 
 Strange shit started happenin' Cory shot Drew 
 And we was friends Like C shot Ra for some ends

 Shit just starts again (Verse 3) Yeah I've been gone for a minute

 Nigga I'm doin' good So I take a quote from Menace 
 "Look at the wheels" I got a trunk full of guns 
 From VA today I'm addicted to stuntin' 
 Now that I'm holdin' somethin' (oh yeah
