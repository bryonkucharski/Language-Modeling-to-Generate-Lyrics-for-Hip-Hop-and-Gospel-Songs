I'm trying to move one brick, 2 brick, 3 bricks, four, more 
 I'm trying to move 5 bricks, 10 bricks, 20 bricks raw 
 (I smoke one ounce staring at the caddy on the showroom floor 
 Now I'm trying to move 5 pounds, 10 pounds, 20 pounds, more 
 Boy) 
 Run tell the Bloods I'm Crip and go tell the Crips I'm Blood 
 Nigga, I be tripping, bitch, I don't give a fuck 
 I put the K on niggas, I spray on niggas 
 Come through 2012, XJ on niggas 
 I'm a Apex predator, nigga, I'm strolling 
 Shooters on deck, I break bread and they owe me 
 Niggas said I fell off, oh, you heard I fell off? 
 Why the fuck would you be repeating that? 
 Nigga, I'm a rap tycoon, make a 100 mill by June 
 Now who the fuck said I can't rap, Jack? 
 I'm in a dope fiend's dream, I got it for 'em raw 
 That's that morphine memories, except I'm breaking the law 
 I was born a problem, in the stroller with the llama 
 I'm violent, I kill a nigga, put that on my mama 
 Nah, nah, don't tell me nothing about none of these niggas 
 I smoke all these niggas for this bread 
 I'm trying to move one brick, 2 brick, 3 bricks, four, more 
 I'm trying to move 5 bricks, 10 bricks, 20 bricks raw 
 (I smoke one ounce staring at the caddy on the showroom floor 
 Now I'm trying to move 5 pounds, 10 pounds, 20 pounds, more 
 Boy) 
 I give a fuck about a fed as I jump up outta bed 
 5 pounds, 10 pounds, 20 pounds, yeah 
 I'm trying to put this shit away 
 On the low, I need a hit a day, think you better get away 
 From my, oh, my, I got a bernie that'll fire 
 From Cali to Kingston, back to NY 
 Snoop's master kush, smoke 5 to 9 
 Come by and get you some pounds and now you flying high 
 Run with the metal with my foot to the pedal 
 G's with the trees and the C's on my level 
 5-0, you know I go hard, these fools caught me go hard 
 Head nigga in charge, this nigga soft as DeBarge 
 But I ain't tripping, I'm just flipping my cheese 
 'Cause if you really want the bomb come and fuck with your G's 
 I got it, always kill, always will 
 Had that, sit that, my nigga get that, you hear that? 
 I'm trying to move one brick, 2 brick, 3 bricks, four, more 
 I'm trying to move 5 bricks, 10 bricks, 20 bricks raw 
 (I smoke one ounce staring at the caddy on the showroom floor 
 Now I'm trying to move 5 pounds, 10 pounds, 20 pounds, more

 5 AM in the kitchen, nigga, I'm coughing 
 Bag full of white 8 balls, I'm going golfing 
 Now homie got killed last night, bought him a coffin 
 Retaliated the same night, made him a dolphin 
 Guess that's the life of a yay flipper 
 Chopper make your ass get naked just like a stripper 
 Got camels for the jackets, home invaders, man 
 Them niggas coming all black like they Raiders fans 
 All I saw growing up was kilos and gangbanging 
 Then the homie taught me to whip, game changing 
 Now I'm breaking down birds on the coffee table 
 Yeah, half them bitches sold before they off the table 
 Gotta look nigga wanted my half, I'm gonna split it 
 The type of nigga work that bitch like it's a killing 
 Sold them more water, stretching like it's elastic 
 Weigh it up in two 50's rapping, I'm plastic, yeah 
 I'm trying to move one brick, 2 brick, 3 bricks, four, more 
 I'm trying to move 5 bricks, 10 bricks, 20 bricks raw 
 (I smoke one ounce staring at the caddy on the showroom floor
