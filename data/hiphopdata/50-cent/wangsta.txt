Yeah, its Fifty, a.k.a Ferrari, F-Fifty 
 Break it down 
 I got alot of livin' to do 'fore I die 
 And I ain't got time to waste, let's make it 
 You say you a gangsta but you neva popped nothin' 
 You say you a wanksta, then you need to stop frontin' 
 You ain't a friend of mine, you ain't no kin of mine 
 What makes you think that I won't run up on you with the nine? 
 We do this all the time, right now we on the grind 
 So hurry up and cop and go, we sellin' nick's and dimes 
 Shorty she so fine, I gotta make her mine 
 An ass like that got to be one of a kind 
 I question every town, punch in with every line 
 I'm fuck'n with they mind, I make 'em press rewind 
 They know they can't shine if I'm around to rhyme 
 Been on parole since '94 'cause I commit the crimes 
 I stay in my line, I did it through the nine 
 The d's ran up in my crib, you know who droppin' dimes 
 You say you a gangsta but you neva popped nothin' 
 You say you a wanksta, then you need to stop frontin' 
 You go to the dealership but you ain't never cop nothin' 
 You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin' 
 You say you a gangsta, but you neva popped nothin' 
 You say you a wanksta, then you need to stop frontin' 
 You go the dealership but you ain't never cop nothin' 
 You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin' 
 Damn, homey, in high school you was the man, homey 
 What the fuck happened to you? 
 I got the sickest vendetta when it come to the cheddar 
 But if you play with my paper, you gone meet me, Beretta 
 Now shorty, think I'mma sweat her sippin' on Amaretto 
 I might hit once, then date her, I know I can do better 
 She look good but I know she after my cheddar 
 She tryin' to get in my pockets, homey, and I ain't gone let her be easy 
 Start some bullshit, you get ya whole crew wet 
 We in the club doin' the same old two step 
 Gorilla unit 'cause they say we bugged out 
 'Cause we don't go nowhere without toasters we thugged out 
 You say you a gangsta but you neva popped nothin' 
 You say you a wanksta then you need to stop frontin' 
 You go to the dealership but you ain't never cop nothin' 
 You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin' 
 You say you a gangsta but you neva popped nothin' 
 You say you a wanksta, then you need to stop frontin' 
 You go to the dealership but you ain't never cop nothin' 
 You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin' 
 Me, I'm no mobsta, me, I'm no gangsta 
 Me, I'm no hit man, me, I'm just me, me 
 Me, I'm no wanksta, me, I'm no actor 
 But it's me you see on your TV 'cause I hustle weed 
 Smashin' shit is so easy 
 I'm gettin' what you get for a brick to talk greasy 
 By any means partner I got to eat on these streets 
 And you play me close, for sure I'mma gon' pop my heat 
 Niggas sayin' they gone merk, Fifty, how? 
 We ridin' around wit guns the size of Lil' Bow Wow 
 What you know about AKs and AR-15s 
 Equipped with night visions, shell cases and M beams 
 You say you a gangsta but you neva popped nothin' 
 You say you a wanksta, then you need to stop frontin' 
 You go to the dealership but you ain't never cop nothin' 
 You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin' 
 You say you a gangsta but you neva popped nothin' 
 You say you a wanksta, then you need to stop frontin' 
 You go to the dealership but you ain't never cop nothin' 
 You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin' 
 Damn homey
