 2 niggaz in the front, 2 niggaz in the back 
 That's 4 niggaz ridin' strapped in grandpa's Cadillac 
 The voice in my head say fuck all these niggaz 
 Then I start thinkin', I should rob all these niggaz 
 Man my homies then wan' do whateva I wan' do

 Lets ride around find a nigga stuntin' on front street 
 With the shine's on niggaz be lookin' like lunch meat 
 I run up on a nigga, pop one on the floor 
 Tell um come up off that shit 'fore we start poppin' some more 
 Fuck a ski mask, man niggaz know who I iz

 (50 Cent Verse) 
 I'm up early in the mornin', tryna make a movie 
 Come in here with me shorty take your lil' on the school 
 Even though she cause the drama, you love your baby momma 
 I hit her with the llama to get this kick 
 There is the coke, the cash, the combo and the safe 
 But she don't know it, damn, ok go away 
 I play with your kid on the couch, while your bitch on the phone 
 Put a gun to her head sayin' daddy come home 
 You was rollin' poppin' bubbly, didn't think it get ugly 
 In the hood shit is lovely until it go bad 
 Now you can pray for a miracle and God might be hearin' you 
 When I'm not in the jam, I write in my hand 
 (50 Cent Chorus) 
 I'll Whip Your Head Boy, you know I will 
 I'll Whip Your Head Boy, with the back of the steal 
 I'll Whip Your Head Boy, you'll get your cap pealed 
 I'll Whip Your Head Boy, your ass could get killed 
 I'll Whip Your Head Boy, you know I will 
 I'll Whip Your Head Boy, with the back of the steal 
 I'll Whip Your Head Boy, you'll get your cap pealed 
 I'll Whip Your Head Boy, your ass could get killed 
 (Young Buck Verse) 
 I got, its homies screamin' Buck you need to calm down 
 Niggaz be gettin' killed every time you come around 
 We ran up in his crib made his momma kiss the ground 
 She askin' God, what my baby dunn did now?

 Duck tape him up, rip the phone cords out the wall 
 Fuck waitin' we can startin' waitin' on tomorrow 
 So ask Satan if he got a car that I can borrow 
 I'm inpatient like a money hungry rap star 
 I jack him for his chain and I can get a new Jaguar 
 The mack I have his brains all over the fuckin' sidewalk 
 And I'ma be on CNN again it ain't my fault 
 March nigga steff, right nigga lef' 
 G-Unit soldier I'm thuggin' till my death
