Flashing lights, lights 
 Flashing lights, lights 
 Flashing lights, lights 
 Flashing lights, lights 
 She don't believe in shootin' stars, 
 But she believe in shoes and cars 
 Wood floors in the new apartment, 
 Couture from the store's department 
 You more like L'eau de Stardee shit, 
 I'm more of the, trips to Florida 
 Order the h'orderves, views of the Water 
 Straight from the page of your favorite author 
 And the weather so breezy, 
 Man why can't life always be this easy 
 She in the mirror dancing so sleazy, 
 I get a call like where are you Yeezy 
 Try to hit you with a 'Oeur de Whopee' 
 Till I get flashed by the paparazzi 
 Damn, these niggas got me, 
 I hate these niggas more than the Nazi 
 As I recall, I know you love to show off 
 But I never thought that you would take it this far 
 What do I know? Flashing lights, lights 
 What do I know? Flashing lights, lights 
 I know it's been a while, 
 Sweetheart, we hardly talk, I was doing my thing 
 I know I was foul bay-bay, 
 A-bay lately you been all on my brain, 
 And if somebody would've told me a month ago 
 Fronting though, yo I wouldn't wanna know 
 If somebody would've told me a year ago 
 It'd go, get this difficult 
 Feeling like Katrina with no fema 
 Like Martin with no Gina 
 Like a flight with no visa 
 First class with the seat back I still see ya 
 In my past, you on the other side of the glass 
 Of my memory's museum, 
 I'm just saying, Hey Mona Lisa, 
 Come home you know you can't Rome without Caesar 
 As I recall, I know you love to show off 
 But I never thought that you would take it this far 
 What do I know? Flashing lights, lights 
 What do I know? Flashing lights, lights 
 As you recall, you know I love to show off 
 But you never thought that I would take it this far 
 What do you know? Flashing lights, lights 
 What do you know? Flashing lights, lights 
 Flashing lights, lights 
 Flashing lights, lights 
 Lights, lights, lights, lights 
 Lights, lights, lights, lights 
 Lights, lights, lights, lights
