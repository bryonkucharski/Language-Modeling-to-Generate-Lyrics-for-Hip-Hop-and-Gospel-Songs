Nights like this... I wish. 
 Rain drops would fall 
 5 heartbeats left 
 One last deep breath. 
 50Cent: 
 I got a 16 shot Rugger, I got 16 cars 
 All over how I write 16 bars. 
 Ja, Joe and Jada they're fuckin' retards 
 I run Interscope, uh-uh Oh, my God 
 Your stuff I'll make it hot 
 You want I'll get ya shot 
 You're just open your coffin 
 You're dead men walking. 
 Now when I'm out in London they say I'm so smart, 
 I fired rounds from pounds I came up so hard. 
 I been around the world and aiya-ya-ya 
 Must be goin' crazy. 
 'Cause I'm still down, 
 To get down to let off rounds 
 I'm loadin up my 380 
 I can't wait till I see death. 
 Tony Yayo: 
 I'm tryin' to pray to the preacher man but he in new gators 
 My ASCAP check got a nigga new haters. 
 The condos in Vegas - cause NY freezin', 
 My strap is the reason that you on the floor bleedin'. 
 ??Coke and?? Young - WATCHIN' 50! 
 And learned the dope game fast ask Bo-Diddly. 
 Automatic Mossberg in the all white fur 
 Shotgun pellets out of snow white spur. [shot] {DAMN!} 
 I been around the world and aiya-ya-ya! 
 Must be goin' crazy. 
 'Cause I'm still down, 
 To get down to let off rounds. 
 I'm loadin' up my 380 
 I can't wait till I see - death! 
 Oh baby!
