"Officer Ricky (Go Head, Try Me)" 
 You think you know me? (Officer Ricky) 
 Nigga, You don't know me! (Officer Ricky) 
 50... ayo! C-O! 
 I put a razor through ya face 
 I put a nine on my waist 
 I cock the shotty just in case 
 I pump nothin' but bass 
 I put a pint of blood in the whip 
 A pint of blood on the ground 
 Bullets, bullets get to ricochetin 
 Bouncing all around 
 That body all case cold I got her white wit it 
 If they ask me I think niggas from basely did it 
 I'm a southside nigga, we take on all comers 
 The first shot pop, we get to warrin all summer 
 These niggaz ain't hard I get on 'em on some different shit 
 Different strap, different clip, I blow the door off your whip 
 The cop fucked fox, sucked the cunt on the bimbo 
 Faggot must've thought he knock me out like Kimbo 
 With gondorea lips, his breath stronger than endo 
 Fat fuck playin' wii fit nintendo 
 Have another tattoo, here's another tattoo 
 Run into my goons soon, have new bullet wounds 
 Officer Ricky, radio for backup 
 See ya ass anywhere you know I'm gon act up 
 You want play with me, when I don't want play? 
 Have my niggas whip the skin off your ass in broad day 
 Screaming boss, nigga you ain't a boss 
 Pussy nigga ya lost, listen officer Ross 
 I tell you straight suck a dick 
 You tryna come with subliminals 
 'Cause your ass the police 
 My niggaz is criminals 
 It's like every other word out your mouth 'bout a bird 
 Like you sling cocaine, this shit is absurd 
 You's a rapper, you's a motherfuckin rapper 
 It's a wrap, your career is fuckin' wrapped up 
 My enemy's enemies are my friends 
 And my semis they like Siamese twins 
 See 'em up close, you won't see shit again 
 Like every fairytale, boy your life has to end 
 Try me, get blown away way way 
 Go 'head try me, get blown away way way 
 Try me get blown away way way 
 Go head try me, get blown away way way 
 (We the best!) 
 Yeah, you the best, you the cocksucking best 
 Go 'head faggot, depp throat it, feel it in your chest 
 I'm not friendly, I'm anti-social 
 Go 'head try me, I'll be fucking ya up, like I'm supposed to 
 You say I'm violent, now why you say I'm violent? 
 The mac got a muffler, make a loud mouth silent 
 Now Me, I'm kinda sensitive, So watch the way you talk to me 
 Ya better off shootin me, or tryna put the hawk to me 
 The beef ain't shit to me, 'cause now I got the wolves out 
 That fo-fo pull around, that tre pound bulls out 
 I do it for the moula, boo-ya, bullseye 
 Pop ya fuckin' noodles, deputy do die 
 Many men wish death, many men "oh doe" 
 I make many millions, fuck wit me, that's a "no no" 
 This is motion picture shit, there's no director to cast me 
 The D's, I plead the 5th on every question they ask me 
 My enemy's enemies are my friends 
 And my semis they like Siamese twins 
 See 'em up close, you won't see shit again 
 Like every fairytale, boy your life has to end 
 Try me, get blown away way way 
 Go head try me get blown away way way 
 Try me, get blown away way way 
 Go head try me get blown away way way 
 Nigga I bleed blue, I swear I bleed blue 
 You thinkin' I'm a crip, I'll motherfuckin trip 
 The cool-out blood, maybe I'm all blood 
 Find out what a nigga bout when you catch a slug 
 Maybe I'm maniac, maybe I'm crazy 
 Maybe I'm exactly what my fucking hood made me 
 Maybe imma do 25 years for murder 
 Maybe 'cause it's clear I'm the clip inserter 
 I done lost my best friend, he died of cancer 
 Call me a cheetah, I attack like a panther 
 It's teflon vinyl on my drop-top phantom 
 Bulletproof windows, and a stash for the cannon 
 Nigga if you cross me, you gon' have to off me 
 I just keep going no matter where they lost me 
 You know I'm like a time bomb- bomb steady tickin 
 You know what's coming next, once nigga slap the clip in 
 Oh yeah 
 My enemy's enemies are my friends 
 And my semis they like Siamese twins 
 See 'em up close, you won't see shit again 
 Like every fairytale, boy your life has to end 
 Try me get blown away way way 
 Go head try me get blown away way way 
 Try me get blown away way way 
 Go head try me get blown away way way 
 Yeah, this nigga's a appetizer 
 Where you at wayne? 
 The full course meal wayne 
 You awfully quiet 
 You call Em out, well now I'm out 
 I got my vultures out 
 You got get pass me to get em 
 I'm the baby over here 
 I'm the smallest nigga in my clique 
 Shady after-motherfucking-math nigga 
 3 headed monster - 50, Em, Dre 
 Fuck with it if you want nigga
