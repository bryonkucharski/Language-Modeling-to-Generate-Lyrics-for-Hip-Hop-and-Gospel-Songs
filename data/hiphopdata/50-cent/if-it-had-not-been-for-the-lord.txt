If it had not been for the Lord, 
 Who was on my side, 
 I wanna know where I'd be, 
 If it had not been for the Lord, 
 Who was on my side 
 I wanna know where I'd be 
 v1 
 When I think about all the many times 
 That I could have been cast away, 
 And God's love and grace sold my destiny, 
 And he kept me from all tragedy 
 Each and everyday as I kneel and pray 
 And ask the Lord for one more chance, 
 New mercy that He let me see 
 That's why I can sing and dance 
 v2 
 Remember the time when I thought that I 
 Was just about to lose my mind, 
 Lost in despair, thought no one cared, 
 Headed down the road to nowhere, 
 I can look back and see everything God's done for me, 
 Through dangers seen and unseen 
 The Lord show protected me. 
 Where would I be (If He hadn't kept me) 
 What would I say (If He hadn't shown me) 
 How would I know (If the Lord hadn't kept me) 
 Through all of my ups and downs He's the best friend I 
 Have found 
 I don't know what I would do if it had not been for the 
 Lord on my side. 
 If it had not been for it (3x) 
 For the Lord on my side 
 If had not been for it (3x) 
 I don't know where I would be.
