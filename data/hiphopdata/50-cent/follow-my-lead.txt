(Chorus: 50 Cent) 
 Follow my lead, baby I could be all you need, If you follow my lead 
 Follow my lead, I'll hold you down put your trust in me, baby follow my lead 
 Follow my lead, I think God made you for me, follow my lead 
 Follow my lead, I'm the one Girl in time you'll see 
 (Verse 1: 50 Cent) 
 Don't listen to the rumours they say 50 fuckin' crazy 
 50 don't know how to treat a lady 
 They wrong, I like you a lot I don't wanna hurt you 
 But I call a square a square and a circle a circle 
 So if you act like a bitch, I call you a bitch then hang up 
 Probably call you right back and shit 
 And I have to say baby I apologize, cross my fingers God forgive me for 
 Tellin' lies 
 Like Janet Jackson say "I miss you much, I really wanna feel your touch" 
 As Bobby said "Baby I could pass the day, watchin' you model Lingerie" 
 I wanna spend the night tonight shorty If its okay 
 You can be my Beyonce I'll be your Jay 
 I gotta great sense of humour, questions make ya smile then I whoo ya! 
 You know how I do ya, or do ya? 
 (Chorus: 50 Cent) 
 Follow my lead, baby I could be all you need, If you follow my lead 
 Follow my lead, I'll hold you down put your trust in me, baby follow my lead 
 Follow my lead, I think God made you for me, follow my lead 
 Follow my lead, I'm the one Girl in time you'll see 
 (Verse 2: 50 Cent) 
 It's New York, to London, you wonderin' what's gonna be the next stop 
 I told you, I'm'a Don you goin' on ma'dam 
 After you shop till your feet hurt in Malones 
 Now take a picture these are moments you can cherrish 
 They say the scene of me was made for lovers out in Paris 
 The risers and the believers sayin' "50 we love you" 
 But out there, there's no me so I love them 
 You may not recognize this, the reason I exist 
 Deliver best than the best so perfection I guess 
 Just like I miss the stress, I'll pass the test 
 Everytime I drop, I'm burnin' hot 
 I don't care If she loves me or loves me not 
 As long as I enjoy the time that we spent 
 I don't care, baby we could fuck and be friends 
 Matter fact we can do it right in the back of my Benz 
 You know it's me... 
 (Chorus: 50 Cent) 
 Follow my lead, baby I could be all you need, If you follow my lead 
 Follow my lead, I'll hold you down put your trust in me, baby follow my lead 
 Follow my lead, I think God made you for me, follow my lead 
 Follow my lead, I'm the one Girl in time you'll see
