I can tell you want girl 
 You ain't gotta worry no more 
 You keep my bottles cold and you pop 'em 
 As soon as I walk in the door 
 These dude don't know me from Adam and Eve 
 That's why they can't mess up my flow 
 And when this beat drops, your heart stops 
 You feel it from your head to your toes 
 If you know what I'm talking 'bout 
 Let me see you work it out 
 Girl that's what I'm talking 'bout 
 I got sexy ladies all over the floor 
 You're talking to one of the greatest 
 Who did it before 
 Now I'm back with one of my latest 
 Just letting you know 
 That I got sexy ladies so back up some more 
 Let me take it off 
 I know a little girly from uptown 
 Just waiting just to cater to me 
 I know a little betty from downtown 
 That'll do anything that I please 
 All my other people that dance around 
 When they hear me rocking the groove 
 Now it might sound cocky 
 But is it really cocky if you know that it's true 
 If you know what I'm talking 'bout 
 Let me see you work it out 
 Girl that's what I'm talking 'bout 
 I got sexy ladies all over the floor 
 You're talking to one of the greatest 
 Who did it before 
 Now I'm back with one of my latest 
 Just letting you know 
 That I got sexy ladies so back up some more 
 And let me take it off 
 Sexy, sexy, sexy 
 Walk that body, talk that body 
 Sexy, sexy, sexy 
 Walk that body, talk that body 
 Sexy, sexy, sexy 
 Walk that body, talk that body 
 Sexy, sexy, sexy 
 Walk that body, talk that body 
 Now break it down 
 Now move a little bit to the left 
 Now move back over here to the right 
 Now let me see you walk, walk, yeah 
 Let me see you walk 
 Here comes your part girl 
 Sexy, sexy, sexy 
 Walk that body, talk that body
