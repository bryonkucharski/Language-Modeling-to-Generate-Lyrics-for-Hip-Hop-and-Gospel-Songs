(Feat. Tony Yayo, Lloyd Banks) 
 Is Is the Unit Is Is the Unit 
 Coke Life what's the matter with your clothes 
 Coke Life did you put it all in your nose 
 Coke Life every body can't be on top 
 Coke Life call me when it's time to cop 
 50 Cent: 
 I got 99 bottle of beer on the wall and 99 grams left to flips that's all 
 Like toasting a stagier I'll show you how to cut this quick 
 Double up out this bitch The D's know me 
 I'm the one that got away 
 Ask the homies they'll tell you about the way 
 I'm a hustla I got it in my blood 
 I'm still hungry I'm out to get it just because 
 One Coupe One block one spot it's not enough 
 Were taking over like the old heads told us yeah! 
 Coke Life what's the matter with your clothes 
 Coke Life did you put it all in your nose 
 Coke Life every body can't be on top 
 Coke Life call me when it's time to cop 
 Tony Yayo: 
 Listen I got that white girl on Pablo shit 
 Looking like a glass of milk on my diablo bitch 
 Remember packs on my ass with the due, due brown stains 
 Now it's rose gold rims and the due, due drown Range 
 I hear 50 giving Michel Jack money for this shows 
 1.4 ask Mateo Hundred gran from me buy some Yayo 
 Turn it into a mill I stretch to Yayo 
 Stay in the shoot out Yay, lay low naw man my 44 blows 
 Million brake head ma I live lavige I kill a Nigga 
 Quicker to do 20 days like Paris Hilton 
 The crystal spillan 50 chillan Yayo Chillan 
 Vitamin water had us 400 million 
 Coke cola bought for 4 big billion!

 Lloyd Banks:

 Rap stops selling I'm gonna cook this Nigga 
 Blue cooler than a Mac out the movies

 Coke Life did you put it all in your nose 
 Coke Life every body can't be on top
