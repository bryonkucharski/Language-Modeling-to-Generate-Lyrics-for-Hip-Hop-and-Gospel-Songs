 (50 Cent) 
 Now homey I say I runnit runnit 'cause I'm in control 
 Hpnotiq, Hennessy, a couple shots of Patrón 
 I have ya feeling aight, I get ya high as a kite 
 Party-poppin' shawty says she coming with me tonight 
 I ain't shoulda' leanin', I ain't snapping and popping either 
 I'm bopping my head or I'm just standing there watching 
 I'ma hustler I hustle, you can tell that I'm paid 
 And I protect what I got, I'm in a house with my blade 
 Nigga you front you gonna get it, OK now maybe I've said it 
 'Cause I want you to triddip, yeah I be on that shit hit 
 You should see when I'm stuntin' I flash the stones to be wanton 
 Push the grip see me rollin', you can tell that I'm holdin' 
 I'm just doing my thang, you know the units the game 
 I got my grimey Shady with me you front you'll have to get me 
 Off your ass I'll pay the lawsuit and laugh 
 Haha it's not a big deal it's nothing but some cash 
 Lets Go... 
 Who run it? 
 You know ya acting like ya don't know

 You know but ya acting like ya don't know 
 Who run it? 
 You know ya acting like ya don't know 
 I tear the club up fo sho 
 This flow is gon' bring mo dough 
 You know but ya acting like ya don't know 
 (Eminem) 
 When me and Fif' got together to do this music and movie 
 The more we became enveloped we just developed a fellowship through it 
 It's no pretend shit its friendship mi nemesis es su nemesis 
 Same for him it's just media see to them images it's just images 
 But this shit is no gimmicks this is blood-in and blood-out 
 When there's beef you just gotta know when to butt-in and butt-out, 
 If there's a problem we solve it, we don't resolve it 
 It usually just evolves into one big brawl and we all get involved in it 
 We should all get a merit, cause most beef we inherit 
 And wear it like a badge of honor pass it around and share it 
 And let it go to whoever's holding the most current beef on they're shoulders 
 And the soldiers got their backs till it's over 
 But tonight, we ain't come in here to beef with nobody 
 We came to party - Banks, Cashis and Mr. Ferrari 
 So it's Shady Afterm-izzath back in that ass 
 You wizz-ass, come-izzon, what kinda fizz-uckin musician is that? 
 Who run it? 
 You know ya acting like ya don't know 
 I tear the club up fo sho 
 This flow is gon' bring mo dough 
 You know but ya acting like ya don't know 
 Who run it? 
 You know ya acting like ya don't know 
 I tear the club up fo sho 
 This flow is gon' bring mo dough 
 You know but ya acting like ya don't know 
 (Cashis) 
 Pistol play ricochet see where the victim lay 
 Slumped over bleedin, J.F.K 
 H.K. to ya chest plate, cave 
 I will ride to the death, do you rep thatta way? 
 Forever I'ma be a Shady 7-4 gangsta 
 Plus I'll survive everything you got in that chamber 
 I thrive off of danger, jumpin' in all beef 
 You keep talking shit, now the squad can call me 
 (Lloyd Banks) 
 Enough holding back the steam, Em let off a magazine 
 Dapper Don, Cap' of Queens, mixed in with Cashis creams 
 Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see 
 Telling ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'ma fucking G? 
 I'm all automatic when I'm at it, start static and you splattered 
 Shit shattered, I'ma walking bitch magnet 
 Spit it how I live it live it always to the limit 
 And I'm always on my pivot for my digits you dig it? 
 So... 
 We run it 
 You know ya acting like ya don't know 
 I tear the club up fo sho 
 This flow is gon' bring mo dough 
 You know but ya acting like ya don't know 
 Who run it? 
 You know ya acting like ya don't know 
 I tear the club up fo sho 
 This flow is gon' bring mo dough 
 You know but ya acting like ya don't know 
 Who run it?
