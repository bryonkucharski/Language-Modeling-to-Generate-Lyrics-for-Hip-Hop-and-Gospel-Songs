(Male sings in background, which repeats the last word on every other line during 50 Cent's verse; then says "body" throughout Banks and Yayo's verse) 
 (50 Cent) 
 Ga ga G-Unit! (body) haha, yo, yo 
 I need no introduction, everybody (body) 
 Heard of 50 Cent, and heard of G-Unit 
 I'm not high-tech and I'm not Pradi (Pradi) 
 You see me in the club 
 You better tell the bouncers to treat me special, I'm somebody (body) 
 'Cause I get on that jet, in 5 minutes flat 
 Niggas'll come back, shoot up your party (party) 
 If I don't have fun, nobody havin' none 
 I'm tryin' to holla at ya, come here shorty (shorty) 
 Shout out to my nigga Juvie, whack goes here buck 
 My niggas from New Orleans, wodie (wodie) 
 If we on the same page, when you see me on stage 
 You gonna throw your hands up, and you gonna applaud me (plaud me) 
 You know how I get, I'm still on that bullshit, nigga, nigga 
 (Tony Yayo) 
 I run around with the trey (body) pound like it's a sport 
 And call my name in the bench, while I sit in court 
 I got a million dollar smile (body), and a fist full of pesos 
 And the wrist so icey, it could light up a stage show 
 In the club (body), nigga I stay holdin' 
 'Cause I'm on point for them wolves, and sheep clothin' 
 I play the bar (body), with a double shot of Henny 
 Cause after this spot, its cheaters, and envy 
 (Shorty if you feel a nigga, call me) (body) 
 (Lloyd Banks) 
 Yeah, Banks, yeah 
 Look you ain't got to like me, that's (body) cool, I don't give a fuck 
 Clowny time ain't gonna put me in a bigger truck 
 Fuck kids, it (body) ain't my turn to be stressed 
 A bitch worse nightmare is a paternity test 
 I'm too young to be faithful (body) 
 If money, means love, I hate you 
 I only trick on the first of April 
 Holla at me, if you thugged (body) out shorty ready to fight you 
 Dice, roll a blunt, and pull the snub out for me 
 And if your not don't even (body) call me 
 (Gun shot fired, yelling)
