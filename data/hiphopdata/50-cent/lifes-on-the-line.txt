Nobody likes me 
 Nobody likes me, but that's okay 
 'Cause I don't like y'all anyway 
 And I don't like y'all anyway 
 Fuck all y'all! 
 My watch talk for me, my whip talk for me 
 My gat talk for me 
 Blat! What up homie 
 For bitches who don't know me 
 They want to blow me 
 Cause the shit I floss wit sayin' a lot for me 
 I came into rap humble, I don't give a fuck now 
 Serve anybody like niggas who hustle uptown 
 Coke price go up, cats is come down 
 The D's run in my crib, I'm nowhere to be found 
 The bitch who hustle for me, they don't even stash tracks 
 They keep it on em, right there in they ass crack 
 When I don't like a nigga, I don't pretend to 
 I'll have the paramedics wrap your fuckin' head like a Hindu 
 Look, I ain't goin' nowhere, so get used to me 
 O-G's look at me and see what they used to be 
 I'm that nigga that sold coke, the nigga that sold dope 
 The nigga that shot Dice when he broke to So So 
 The thug, they pop shit 
 The thug that pop clips 
 The thug that went from three and a half to whole bricks 
 Nigga ain't in his right mind, goin' against me 
 My picture's painted through words that make a blind man see 
 Scream murder! (I don't believe you!) 
 Murder! (Fuck around and leave you!) 
 Murder! (I don't believe you!) 
 Murder, murder! (Your life's on the line!) 
 Y'all niggas don't want no parts of me 
 I'm tryna figure out how y'all started me 
 Make me catch her on the late night 
 Pop shots wit the fifth and slide off wit the six 
 I'm not a marksmen while spark issue, I spray random 
 Not a pretty nigga but my moms think I'm handsome 
 I hate to hear "He say, She say" shit 
 Unless he say she say she on my dick-
