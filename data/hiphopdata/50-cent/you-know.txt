Cee-Lo, we know 
 I'm sitting on leather, I'm a winner 
 If I crap out the strap out 
 'Cause I snap right back to the beginning, nigga 
 You know I will let it pop 
 Front if you want bitch I will make it hot 
 You know, you think you ill, but you not 
 You will need a tombstone, you will need a plot 
 I peep what niggas hate through my peripherals 
 Boy, if I leave this club back to the car I got some shit for you 
 Wanna party? We can paint the town red 
 Them bottles ain't shit to me, a nigga got bread 
 I'm big money, big business, I love it 
 For the bad bitches with big asses and the budget 
 I'm the boss, until you know shit is going how it got to go 
 I don't want talk tonight, I might just buy the hoes 
 My pleasure principle spend no expense 
 First I'm happy then she happy then she can pay the rent 
 It's nothing to a nigga when he up 
 But when they down I bet you he won't give a bitch a bump 
 Flip and catch an attitude like 'Bitch, what the fuck 
 You want from a nigga, huh? You fucking up a nigga, huh?' 
 Look, girl, you know you sitting on a gold mine 
 Fuck with them other niggas think you so fine 
 You know I will let it pop 
 Front if you want bitch I will make it hot 
 You know, you think you ill, but you not 
 You will need a tombstone, you will need a plot 
 My flow hotter than the gun after that clip done 
 Don't care about the set you claim, motherfuck the gang you bang 
 I hang around with hustlers and hoodlums 
 That party get the popping then we beefing and we shooting 
 Let's party like it's 1999 
 Flat top Gazelle, the swag going back in time 
 I got it locked, they can't ignore it 
 Man, nigga, know some bullshit I'm all for it 
 Heroin Don seven sixty leaning 
 Chrome clean, spend a nigga scheming trying to hit a lick 
 Them victim niggas thinking, 'Damn, why me?' 
 I'm thinking why these niggas never try me 
 Maybe they feel the vibe, they know a nigga live 
 I let it off inside and outside 
 The club rocking, it's on tonight 
 Them bottles popping, we getting right 
 You know I will let it pop 
 Front if you want bitch I will make it hot 
 You know, you think you ill, but you not 
 You will need a tombstone, you will need a plot
