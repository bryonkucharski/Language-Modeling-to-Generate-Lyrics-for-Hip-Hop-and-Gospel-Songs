50 bars of pleasure 50 bars of pain 
 When I'm dead and gone niggaZ gonna remember my name 50 
 Yo black is flashy like Alpo gun happy like Pappy 
 Sneaky muthafucka remind me of nigga that clap me 
 He ain't the type you shoot dice with and win dog 
 Unless you try'na get your ass laid out in gilmore 
 Yes we soldiers, remind me of Troy and E-Bags 
 When they came through they hollad like "What up Conrad?" 
 Grimey niggaz they loved to get gully 
 Summer time still had on black gloves and scullies 
 The Lex 450 pulled up that's Cornbread 
 Them niggaZ from Philly would of called him an old head 
 But he an OG remind me of ChaZ and Bump real low key 
 Sounded like he didn't know nothing about drama 
 For this money shit many men do trauma 
 Switchy walked in son, this bitch had the baddest ass 
 The bulletproof glass was rolled up on the S-Class 
 Heard in DC he kept mad blocks in order 
 Picture this a young nigga gettin' it like Rich Porter 
 Sonny came in for half a pit 
 He got knocked, he on lock still controllin' his spot from constop 
 Pop pulled up in the CL5 his project changed 
 His man just got fucking murked by Salene 
 Heard he got it in the range nigga came popped one in his brain 
 Over some-thing took his watch and his chain 
 Country boys off the hook down there in Richmond main. 
 In the black 740 I sat, my hat turned back 
 Bow down baby nelly singing my wrist blinging What! 
 I'm waiting on this nigga Wise we lost for two pies 
 Son he smokin' that shit I can see it in his eyes 
 Comin' up wise emotions closed 
 An' most buying round looking for wisemen toast 
 Benny hopped out the Esculade with a few thourough men from B-More 
 They sellin herion in Maryland reverse back to diesel 
 Killed like 4 fiends his popularity grew that only meant more cream 
 First it was him and his brother now he got a team 
 Went from 5 and a half grams to living the dream 
 City pulled up Goddamn you know his format 
 Bentley is all marble in the door and floor match 
 Get the hats out the stash box popped two glocks 
 Peace "All eyeZ on me" 2pac 
 Everybody knows he a boss he still gotta floss 
 He on the same bullshit that sent Gotti up north 
 That's Dime in the blue TS stunting like he Nicky Barnes 
 He broke but he talk like a Don 
 Homes hoppin out the Jag that's Max haitin cat 
 Kill a nigga quick remind me of Haitian Jack 
 I peep his style son I know his steelo, He on the d-low 
 He smile at niggaZ mumbling fuck you in Creole 
 Heard war stories bout how he maneuver with the Ruger 
 Hold the iron horiZontally and send shots throug h ya 
 Few niggaZ tried to murk him, most them got found 
 Some turned away try to run they in wheelchairs now 
 Banks hopped out bulletproof this, bulletproof that 
 Bulletproof snorkel, bulletproof hat 
 Got out a Black Hummer he blew 90 on that 
 Poppin' mad shit like he gonna bulletproof that lets go
