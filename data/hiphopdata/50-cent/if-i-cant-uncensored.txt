(Hook: 50 Cent) 
 If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done 
 Now I'ma let the champagne bottle pop 
 I'ma take it to the top 
 Fo sho I'ma make it hot, baby (baby) 
 (Verse 1: 50 Cent) 
 I apply pressure to pussies that stuntin I pop 
 Stand alone squeezin my pistol I'm sure that I gotta 
 Now Peter Piper picked peppers and don't rock rhymes 
 I'm 50 Cent, I write a lil bit but I pop nines 
 Tell niggaz, "Get they money right," 'cause I got mine 
 And I'm around quit playin' nigga you can't shine 
 You gon be that next chump to end up in the trunk 
 After bein hit by the pump, is that whut you want? 
 Be easy nigga, I'll lay your ass out 
 Believe me nigga, that's whut I'm about, gangsta! 
 You could find a nigga sittin' on chrome 
 Hit the clutch, hit the gear, hit the gas & I'm gone (Yeah!) 
 (Hook: 50 Cent) 
 If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done 
 Now I'ma let the champagne bottle pop 
 I'ma take it to the top 
 Fo sho I'ma make it hot, baby (baby) 
 (Verse 2: 50 Cent (Dr Dre)) 
 I'm down for the action, he smart with his mouth so smack em 
 You holdin' a strap, he might come back so clap em 
 React like a gangsta, die like a gangsta for actin' 
 'Cause you'll get hit and homicide'll be askin, "What happened?" 
 OH NO look who clappin' wit the FO'FO' 
 20 inch rims sittin' on LOW-CHRO 
 Eastside, Westside niggaz OH YO, I'M LOCO 
 Even my mama said, "Something really wrong with my brain" 
 Niggaz don't rob me they know I'm down to die for my chain 
 G-UNIT! We get it poppin' in the hood 
 G-UNIT! Muthafucka whuts good? 
 I'm waitin on niggaz to act like they don't know how to act 
 I had a sip of too much Jack, I'll blow 'em off the map 
 With the mack, thinkin' it's all rap 
 Till that ass get clapped and Doc say "It's a wrap" 
 (It's a wrap, nigga) 
 (Hook: 50 Cent) 
 If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done 
 Now I'ma let the champagne bottle pop 
 I'ma take it to the top 
 Fo sho I'ma make it hot, baby (baby) 
 (Verse 3: 50 Cent) 
 I been feelin' I had to teach lessons to slow learners 
 Go head act up, get smacked in the head with the burner 
 I don't fight fair, I'm dirty-dirty 
 I'm from Southside Jamaica, Queens, nigga ya'heard me? 
 When streetlights come on niggaz blast the nines 
 Get locked up, they read books to pass the time 
 In the game there's up's and down's, so I stay on the grind 
 Niggaz on my dick more than my bitch, I stay on they mind 
 They ain't nothin' they could do to stop my shine 
 This is God's plan homie, this ain't mine 
 I played the music loud so Grandpa called me a nuisance 
 And Grandma; who always gotta throw in her 2 cents 
 I'm the drop out who made more more money than his teachers 
 Ruthless like the Coupe but I come with more features 
 I am what I am, you could like it or love it 
 It feels good to pull 50 grand and think nothin' of it 
 Fuck it 
 (Hook: 50 Cent) 
 If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done 
 Now I'ma let the champagne bottle pop 
 I'ma take it to the top 
 Fo sho I'ma make it hot, baby (baby) 
 If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done 
 Now I'ma let the champagne bottle pop 
 I'ma take it to the top 
 Fo sho I'ma make it hot, baby (baby) 
 Uh huh, hood make it hot
