Don't make this complicated 
 My old school candy painted 
 I hustle hard 
 When I come through they like "Oh my God! That nigga clean!" 
 From the beginning, it was written I suppose 
 I break a whole on the 36 ounce 
 And move it, I'm a hustler, baby 
 I'm a hustler, baby 
 My mind on the money, I ain't tripping on the hoes 
 I blow a whole lot of paper on clothes 
 But dig it, I'm a hustler, baby 
 I'm a hustler, baby 
 I come through, I had the hoes like "Who he?" 
 Seats in the old school Louis 
 Shoes and the belt buckle Louis 
 We don't need more details now do we? 
 Let 'em sag, my swag is True Religion 
 You gonna need Cartier frames to see my vision 
 It smells like cream mixed with weed, this is classy and hood 
 Drama llama time, nigga, what's good? 
 Domino's, motherfucker, it's time to collect 
 Stack paper like I'm trying to fix the national debt 
 I'm just doing what I wanna do, I trip these set 
 This is 50 on that Muammar Gaddafi shit 
 From the beginning, it was written I suppose 
 I break a whole on the 36 ounce 
 And move it, I'm a hustler, baby 
 I'm a hustler, baby 
 My mind on the money, I ain't tripping on the hoes 
 I blow a whole lot of paper on clothes 
 But dig it, I'm a hustler, baby 
 I'm a hustler, baby 
 Get on my level, bitch, I'm careful who I kick it with 
 We talk market and distribution and politics 
 Got a chip on my shoulder, chip off the whole block 
 I sell the chip of a whole rock, 10 dollars a pop 
 I'm a magnet, the bitch can't help but watch me 
 Socks, drawers, undershirt, Versace, Versace, Versace 
 Designer threads in every form of fashion 
 I express myself so the question I'm askin' 
 Is this flip or the next flip tailor 50 shit? 
 We ain't promised tomorrow, nigga, go on and get the shit 
 That skull and bones, that Alexander McQueen thing 
 In case you ain't notice this a Queens thing 
 From the beginning, it was written I suppose 
 I break a whole on the 36 ounce 
 And move it, I'm a hustler, baby 
 I'm a hustler, baby 
 My mind on the money, I ain't tripping on the hoes 
 I blow a whole lot of paper on clothes 
 But dig it, I'm a hustler, baby 
 I'm a hustler, baby 
 Oh, it's cold out here 
 It's my kind of weather, I'm cold blooded 
 It's 50 
 When I come through you see me 
 In the Suburbans that's bulletproof, bomb proof, leather six, what else? 
 When I go hard I go hard 
 When I don't want you to see me I switch it up 
 I'm in that black on black Porsche Panamera 
 In the back like "Ooh wee!" 
 We rolling 
 I hustle, man, it's what I do, man 
 Wait, niggas gon' try and tell me how to do this?
