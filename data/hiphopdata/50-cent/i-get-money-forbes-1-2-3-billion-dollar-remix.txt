 I am chillin', in Sean John denim 
 N**** I don't walk nowhere I'm four wheelin 
 Champagne spillin, chillin', no ceilin 
 Stealin a quarter million, feelin', ice grillin 
 Hit the avenue, earthquake up the morgue 
 Give Jacob a call then make a withdrawal 
 Face on the forbes in '94 I did it 
 Don't like it I'm a Bad Boy now let's get it come on!

 (Verse 3: Jay-Z) 
 I'm a hustler, baby! Can't escape my past 
 When I flip Rocawear, I told 'em give me money cash 
 Yeah, checks might bounce 
 Alphabet boys might check my counts 
 Still hustlin, baby! Hurry up, kill me 
 I'm already the goat next stop is the billy 
 Young turbo, six speed 9/11 
 I'm revvin, I'm tryin' not to spill my Merlot 
 Where my girl go, on world tour 
 Ladies I'm back on the street like a mount on a furlow 
 I'm back clubbin, Ace of Spade bubblin 
 Drink it from the bottle, who the f*** need a bucket?! 
 I'm killin' the block, most for whips 
 So I'm killing the roof, like Michael Vick 
 Incase y'all forget New York is still mine I get it!
