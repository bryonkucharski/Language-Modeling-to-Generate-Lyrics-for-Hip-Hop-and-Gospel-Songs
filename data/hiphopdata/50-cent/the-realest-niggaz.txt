Before shots, Queens, you heard, I'm a Florida boy 
 But I'm gonna shout y'all niggas out 
 'Cause I got number one love for New York, niggas, you heard? 
 I love niggas, I love niggas 'cause niggas are me 
 And I should only love that which is me 
 I love to see niggas go through changes 
 I love to see niggas shoot through shit 
 And to all niggas that do it, I love 
 To all my Brooklyn 
 (Niggas) 
 To all my Uptown 
 (You niggas understand?) 
 To all my Bronx 
 (It's war, nigga) 
 To all my Queensbridge 
 (I'll blow you away) 
 Back up, chump, you know Biggie Smalls grips it quick 
 And kicks it quick, you know how black niggas get 
 With the hoods, fatigues with the boots with trees 
 Smokin' weed, flippin' ki's, makin' crazy Gs 
 Hittin' buckshots at niggas that open spots on the avenue 
 Take my loot and I'm baggin' you 
 Pimpin' hoes that drive Volvos and Rodeos 
 Flash the Roll, make her wet in her pantyhose 
 Damn, a nigga style is unorthodox 
 Grip the glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks 
 Just in case a nigga wanna act out 
 I just black out and blow they motherfuckin' back out 
 That's a real nigga for ya 
 We the realest, nigga 
 50 Cent and B.I.G., my nigga 
 Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga 
 Biggie, yo' nigga, 50, yo' nigga 
 Squeeze the trigga, leave a nigga fo' sho' 
 We the realest, nigga 
 50 Cent and B.I.G., my nigga 
 Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga 
 Biggie, yo' nigga, 50, yo' nigga 
 Squeeze the trigga, leave a nigga fo' sho' 
 When we smoke spliffs, we pack four fifths 
 Just in case dread wanna riff 
 He get a free lift to the cemetery 
 Rough very not your ordinary, we watch you get buried 
 That's a real nigga for ya 
 Get mad, do a quarter, flip the script and rip your lawyer 
 Spit at the D.A. 'cause fuck what she say 
 She don't give a fuck about your ass anyway 
 Up Northbound, first stop, Watertown and fish scale 
 Where the hand scales are real ill 
 You'll be a super Hoover, doo doo stain remover 
 Yo, G, pass the buddha 
 We the realest, nigga 
 50 Cent and B.I.G., my nigga 
 Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga 
 Biggie, yo' nigga, 50, yo' nigga 
 Squeeze the trigga, leave a nigga fo' sho' 
 When I was young, my M.O. was to go hand in hand 
 And even my P.O., she called me the 'Ginger Bread Man' 
 I cut ya new case and tell her ass catch me if you can 
 Don't let your people feel you're awkward, I tame, I'm not lame 
 Get gassed up to get blast up 
 Real B.I.G. Style, watch the kid break it down 
 Check it, thou shalt not fuck wit North Seed Papa 
 50 Cent, I'll break yo' punk ass off propa 
 There's no place like home, New York, New York 
 I run this city and now I dance around like Diddy 
 Niggas is giddy till they act smack silly 
 Or spray wit the Mack Milly, they don't want drama, really 
 Pushy niggas get hard, lip syncing my lyrics like Milli Vanilli 
 Even the hood, they feel me, I'm on fire 
 Niggas out in Philly, they feel me, they bump my shit 
 Even bootlegged, you know, bump my shit, bitch 
 We the realest, nigga 
 50 Cent and B.I.G., my nigga 
 Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga 
 Biggie, yo' nigga, 50, yo' nigga 
 Squeeze the trigga, leave a nigga fo' sho' 
 I got 50 Cent, I got G-Unit 
 D-Twizzy's in this bitch with Obie Trice 
 So watch what you say before you call our name 
 If you say one more thing, it won't be nice 
 Here we go, I shoulda known 
 I was bound to get pulled into some bullshit sooner or later 
 You little haters are too jealous of us to love us 
 You ain't it, G-Unit made it and Obie's comin', D-Twizzy's comin' 
 You sick to your stomach 
 50 percent is 50 Cent 
 The other 50 percent is who's color skin it is 
 Well, if you're even considering takin' our label down 
 You better find our building and fly a fucking plane into it 
 But I ain't tryin' to get too intricate into it 
 I'm just tryin' to give you a little hint for your own benefit 
 'Cause then it's gonna get to the point 
 Where it escalates into some other shit 
 Then I'ma flip, then I'ma get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones 
 Won't be able to tell if it's two pairs or it's one 
 It's gonna feel like there's so many feet kickin' you 
 You think that Nike just made these into cleat tennis shoes 
 I don't know what it is or what it could be 
 But I get a woody when these pussies try to push me 
 Thinkin' they gon' put me in the position to pickle me 
 Y'all tickle me pink, I think I'd just rather have Pink tickle me 
 Hickory dickory dock, tickety tock tickety 
 A little bit of the diggity dock diggity 
 Mixed with a little bit of the jiga jig jiga 
 With a small pinch of Biggie 
 Look at me, I'm just the bomb diggity 
 We the realest label 
 Don't try to act like you don't feel our label 
 'Cause we gon' fuck around and kill your label 
 Obie, D-Twizzy, G-Unit, 50, Shady Records 
 We the label fo' sho' 
 We the realest label 
 Don't try to act like you don't feel our label 
 'Cause we gon' fuck around and steal your people 
 Obie, D-Twizzy, G-Unit, 50 
 We gon' kill yo' fuckin' label fa sho 
 Shady in the place to be seen 
 And I got what it takes to rock the mic, right? 
 Still watch what you say to me punk 
 'Cause I'm off probation in less then 6 months
