I told niggas not to shoot dice with me 
 Look at this stack 
 I got money 
 I got money 
 (50 Cent) 
 Aww nigga don't trip 
 I'll kill ya if you fuck with my grip 
 I won't hesitate to let off a clip 
 Aww nigga don't trip 
 You gon' make me get on some shit 
 Run up on you quick 
 What up, you're whipped 
 Aww nigga don't trip 
 You gon' get ya monkey ass hit 
 Run in ya whip tryna fuck with my clique 
 Aww nigga don't trip 
 Case you didn't know who this is 
 Its 50 Cent bitch, G-Unit 
 Aww nigga don't trip 
 (Verse 1- 50 Cent) 
 I come through your hood, stuntin' in my yellow lam 
 Murcielago top down, nigga damn 
 I'm the biggest crook from New York since son of Sam 
 Cruisin', bumpin' Bugz shit, ruger in my hand 
 Thinkin' the east ain't enough, its time to expand 
 I plan to head out west and plant my feet down 
 A nigga big as King Kong in the street now 
 I do a lil house shoppin', and buy me a crib 
 Its palm trees and pretty bitches out in Cali kid 
 I touched the Hollywood paper, go and shoot me some flicks 
 Have some supermodel bitches come and suck on some dick 
 My mom turn in her grave if I married a white chick 
 But baby'll suck the chrome off the Chevy and shit 
 Niggas be wearin' fake signs, I'm rockin' a lil charm 
 Thirty karrots on the pinky, kiss the ring on the Don 
 Crack open that Cali bud, stuff the weight in the bomb 
 (Chorus- 50 Cent) 
 Nigga you hustle, but me I hustle harder 
 I got what you need, them trees, that heart, that powder 
 My niggas with gee packs, devour on the hour 
 They shoot when I say shoot, so I'm in the position of power 
 You fuck around if you wanna 
 (Verse 2- 50 Cent) 
 Where I'm from, you learn to blend in, or get touched 
 I don't need niggas for support, I don't walk with a crutch 
 Niggas know my stage, they don't fuck with me son 
 You got an appetite for hollow-tips, I'll feed you my gun 
 This is that ferrari F-50, shit its real laid back 
 Type shit you recline to in the Maybach 
 I got two suiters now, on the run from the fuzz 
 You get the same shit for ten bodies, you get for one 'cause 
 I live life in the fast lane, 100 miles an hour, chrome and some wood grain 
 You know a nigga still really tryna move cane 
 Make a lil extra money on the side mayn 
 I ain't playin', I'm up early with the birds word 
 Puttin' that work in, pirrellis on the Porsche chirpin'(I'm kaing movies) 
 I got a hundred mill from music, a hundred grand from crack 
 Goin' to see my jeweler, so I can blow a stack 
 (Chorus- 50 Cent) 
 Nigga you hustle, but me I hustle harder 
 I got what you need, them trees, that heart, that powder 
 My niggas with gee packs, devour on the hour 
 They shoot when I say shoot, so I'm in the position of power 
 You fuck around if you wanna
