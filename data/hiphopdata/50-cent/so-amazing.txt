(Chorus- Olivia) 
 Summer, winter, spring, and fall 
 I'll be around to catch ya calls 
 'Cause you're my baby (you're my baby) 
 And I adore you 
 You always brighten up my day 
 I never ever let you wait 
 'Cause you're my baby (you're my baby) 
 And you're amazing (so amazing) 
 (Verse 1- 50 Cent) 
 I'm from city to city to shop the show 
 See me I been glidin' across the globe 
 I hustle hard to get the grib fa sho' 
 So when I make time to call you, you should pick up the phone 
 Tell me, what's on your mind when you're alone 
 Have ya touchin' on yourself, girl all in the zone 
 Now if I told you all 
 What things I say would I be wrong 
 Well then I wouldn't be right 
 Matter fact I'd be on the next flight 
 Tryna get it on with you tonight 
 Do the things you like 
 Touch the right spot, have ya piped and hot 
 While the wind blow through your hair in the drop 
 Just lay back, relax to the sounds of the sex 
 And let me to what I do until you climax 
 You can go straight to sleep after it's all over 
 In the mornin' roll over and we can start over 
 (Chorus- Olivia) 
 Summer, winter, spring, and fall 
 I'll be around to catch ya calls 
 'Cause you're my baby (you're my baby) 
 And I adore you 
 You always right, you're not my date 
 I never ever let you wait 
 'Cause you're my baby (you're my baby) 
 And you're amazing (so amazing) 
 (Verse 2- 50 Cent) 
 Yeah I called just to say hope you havin' a nice day 
 You're special, I get into you, oops I mean I'm into you 
 Every chance I get, I find time to spend with you 
 Jet to bring you to me, just to watch a movie 
 Better yet to watch you climb into the ja'causezi 
 Bubbles in the bath, don in the glass 
 Funny how time flies when you full of laughs 
 Its fun but before long, a nigga gotta dash 
 For the lifestyle I live, a nigga need cash 
 To come quick, so I don't fuck with the stash 
 I know you like pumps and boots 
 I like jeeps and coupes, so I grind all the time, just gimme some loot 
 I put a spell on you, I like to call it a spell 
 In the bedroom, workin' it well, I don't kiss and tell 
 But I don't care if you kiss and tell 
 You can tell your girlfriend the details 
 (Chorus x2- Olivia) 
 Summer, winter, spring, and fall 
 I'll be around to catch ya calls 
 'Cause you're my baby (you're my baby) 
 And I adore you 
 You always right, you're not my date 
 I never ever let you wait 
 'Cause you're my baby (you're my baby) 
 And you're amazing (so amazing)
