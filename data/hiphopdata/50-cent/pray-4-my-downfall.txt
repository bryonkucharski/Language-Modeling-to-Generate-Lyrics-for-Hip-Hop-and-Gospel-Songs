 Menace, scene from the movie, clap the two, weigh the oozie 
 Goodfella jewelry heist, diamonds in my bitch doobie 
 I sit back, think about the cats, they hate man I laugh at them 
 Get outta line I blast at them 
 They stay scheming, fuck around let off a clip and leave the whip leaning 
 They dreaming, I took the cream and 
 Move to new places, new faces 
 Fuck the screw faces, shit 
 'Cause when I flip I make the paper 
 Dangerous, G-Unit, niggas can't bang with us 
 It's undeniable the kid is nice 
 The flow CPR, I'll bring Biggie back to life 
 Man, Dre say I'm loony, Em say I'm moody, at least I don't smoke oolies 
 And fuck without rubbers 
 A handful of niggas hate, but the hood love us 
 You can pray for my downfall motherfuckers

 Even if I slip, I'll get back, nigga act up 
 Hollowtips'll tear your back up 
 Gain 30 pounds when you die, no lie 
 I was high when they hit me 
 Had a few gats with me, shit 
 Ain't get a chance to let off 
 They shot me up and sped off 
 Apologies in order, Tamia I adore her 
 But now they strict cause my flow make money flow like water 
 Turn it up a notch, twist the dutch, zone to this, soak it up 
 See me in the club son I'll send niggas to poke you up 
 You know my style 40 cal. with me when I move around 
 Squeeze, catch the shell and run before your ass hit the ground 
 Pussy niggas shouldn't talk, keep my name out your mouth 
 Summerjam, understand, I'm the man, when I leave the crowd leave 
 Shook closer, game over 
 Ride or get rolled over
