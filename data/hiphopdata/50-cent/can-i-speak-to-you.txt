(Verse 1: 50 Cent) 
 Summer heat, hot, murder plots, niggas getting shot 
 Chrome rims for sixes 
 One Wheel, One Gixxer 
 Throw it up, one hand 
 Wave back at the bitches 
 I'm silent 
 Right before I snap I'm violent 
 I call myself the tussle 
 Boss in the muscle 
 Boy I feed your ass brass knuckles 
 A nigga come creeping through the four 
 You scared, get a dog 
 Get a male, because a bitch'll get you both in the mall 
 Now peep the punchlines I'm punching these are knockout blows 
 I'm cyber pimping I got sci-fi hoes 
 This is next-level mack shit 
 That's why my money stack quick 
 12 V's V12 half of them triple black bitch 
 Lust, gluttony, greed, jealousy envy me bitch 
 Your blinds blurring your vision, see I'm where I'm supposed to be 
 On top of the underground 
 Still gritty 
 Still running cities 
 Still Em', Dre, and Fiddy 
 Fuck with me, I'm an usual suspect when it's a hit 
 Turn up the volume and hear my voice, yeah it's the shit 
 Pardon me please, can I speak to you 
 Feel this is something 
 I'm compelled to do 
 (x2) 
 (Verse 2: Schoolboy Q) 
 Pistols and bad bitches 
 Hustlers and bad business 
 Rapping was just a hobby, that hobby turned to a million 
 Had that oxy on sale 
 You can get it 50 a pill 
 Sniff it or let it grill 
 Rap the foil you know the drill 
 Money, power, and drugs 
 My only reason to love 
 Never played cops and robbers, nigga we played Crips and Bloods 
 Like to the pimps saying who the sluts? 
 211 on hookers purses 
 Another double up purchase 
 Slanging a hundred meters from churches 
 God forgive me, but the steal was worth it 
 Man I swear I needed some change, chains and golden rings and thangs 
 Niggas watch videos and think them dudes went from rags to hardest 
 For real lokes know that type of thing makes you a target 
 Either the pigs or I'm gonna get you while you playing boy 
 Hold you like an animal 
 Strapped with a bean that's Adam Braun 
 50 told me ambition wins when your talent ain't working 
 I say I'd rather relapse 
 Than reenact Curtis and put that work in 
 (Verse 3: Schoolboy Q) 
 Floss if you want to I've seen your home broke nigga 
 It ain't a secret I get money you's a joke nigga 
 Make what you make in 2 years in less than a month nigga 
 5th side to south side but we up nigga
