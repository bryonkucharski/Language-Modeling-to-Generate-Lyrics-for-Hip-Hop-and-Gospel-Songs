If you think you're lonely now 
 Wait until tonight, girl 
 Ah man 
 If you think you're lonely now 
 Wait until tonight, girl 
 I'm waitin' on you to come, baby I'm that man 
 Bedroom superhero, naked I'm Batman 
 I kill it then I give ya mouth-to-mouth, CPR 
 Bring ya back to life, climax, start your after life 
 Bounce up and down on my love, this is chronic 
 Have it how you want it, my back shot's bionic 
 She givin' me something I can feel like En Vogue 
 Unload then reload, recharge, I'm back on 
 Back at it, fuckin' up the sprigs in her Craftmatic 
 Jack rabbit, addiction, I don't wanna break that habit 
 Your boy toy man, child it's cool, you can play with me 
 City life, bright lights, tonight you can stay with me 
 I wanna share thoughts, let's talk, go for a walk 
 Fantasies, we can get loose right in the park 
 Bullseye right through her head, to her heart 
 It's mental and physical, when you're gone, I'll be missin' you 
 You gon' get it, you gon' get it 
 I got a plan for you (Got it all planned girl) 
 Girl it's on 'til the 'mon when you come through (ha ha) 
 I can't think of a thing that I won't do (What you wan' do?) 
 When you come and I get my hands on you (Wait 'til I get you girl) 
 I'm Curtis Mayfield, Marvin, the new Bobby Womack 
 2012 freak shit, baby I'm all that 
 The touchin' and the teasin', the pleasure's the reason 
 I'm sure she'll be open from the lickin' and strokin' 
 Or how I say a line and it stimulates her mind 
 My sense of humor, I make her smile while passin' time 
 It's sexual, it's not perverted or obscene 
 The foreplay we play, until I touch her 'til she cream 
 Cash rules the shortie, she's something out a dream 
 Half J-Lo half Jessica Biel, she in between 
 Got that island girl swag, she Dutty Wine 
 When we get back to the spot, that ass is mine 
 See how I switch gears, her bra gone it's on 
 It's showtime, it's my turn to perform 
 Leave the lights on, while I get it, I got it good 
 She sayin' she love my show, I'm sayin' I knew she would 
 You gon' get it, you gon' get it 
 I got a plan for you (Got it all planned girl) 
 Girl it's on 'til the 'mon when you come through (ha ha) 
 I can't think of a thing that I won't do (What you wan' do?) 
 When you come and I get my hands on you (Wait 'til I get you girl)
