I had five-hundred grams in fifty, fifty-eight bags 
 Four hundred Benz, eighty thousand in cash 
 Then the ball dropped, gun popped, banks got blast 
 I make it so hot, one shot'll melt your ass 
 Got popped up, cried 'til my eyes turned red 
 And told myself in the mirror, "Nigga, you ain't dead" 
 I'm far from eccentric, I'm so psychotic 
 I don't need you to shoot for me, nigga, I got it 
 When you see me in the hood, motherfucker, don't talk to me 
 'Less you want talk about usin' a Hawk for me 
 When Al blew Black away I had 'em on some stupid shit 
 Then my rap shit worked now I'm super, stupid rich 
 All I do is stunt now, I'm so Maybach 
 There I go frontin' again, I meant to say laid back 
 Go ahead, move reckless, get banged for your necklace 
 I serve 'em with the semi, feed 'em a clip for breakfast 
 You want some? Come get some 
 Nigga, it's murder one when I toss my gun 
 You might see me let it off, you might see me run 
 But you won't see shit time the police come, huh? 
 You want some? Come get some 
 Nigga, it's murder one when you see my gun 
 I just squeeze and squeeze 'til the whole clip done 
 You just bleed and bleed 'til the police come 
 Huh, you want some? 
 I got a 8th of dope left, half a pound of purple 
 Shooters in my circle, try me, I let 'em murk you 
 Got more guns than a gun store, beefin', what you want, boy? 
 You wanna be nice to me? You wanna shoot dice with me? 
 You want a ace on purpose? Why you so nervous? 
 Nigga, we from the same hood, we come from the same shit 
 You got gonorrhea too, we fucked with the same bitch! 
 Gettin' money is necessary so me, I'm a visionary 
 And I'm sayin' that house should be a crack house 
 Now see it how I see it, or I bring straps out 
 The Tec and the Mac out, the Sig and the Taurus 
 The Koch and that Heckler then nigga, we warin' 
 I let my pistol speak for me and all of 'em foreign 
 Click-clack, comprende? I'm criminal minded 
 Toss money in the sewer, bet nobody find it 
 Till it's rusty and fucked up, forensics have fun, what? 
 You want some? Come get some 
 Nigga, it's murder one when I toss my gun 
 You might see me let it off, you might see me run 
 But you won't see shit time the police come, huh? 
 You want some? Come get some 
 Nigga, it's murder one when you see my gun 
 I just squeeze and squeeze 'til the whole clip done 
 You just bleed and bleed 'til the police come 
 Huh, you want some? 
 Come get it, I'm strapped now, with it 
 Come get it, huh, you want some? 
 Come get it, I'm strapped now, with it 
 Fuck that nigga, huh, you want some?
