Lloyd Banks in the house, bad news 
 Tony Yayo in the house, bad news 
 50 cent in the house, bad news whenever 50 around its bad news 
 Tray pound's in the house, bad news 
 40 Kal's in the house, bad news 
 I got a knife in the house, bad news whenever 50 around its bad news 
 (Lloyd Banks) 
 I think little man mad 'cause I'm flossin' bad 
 I ain't a wrestler, but I'll put your bitch the Boston crab 
 I talk money cause it costs to brag 
 Round here bitches walk round here that the horses have 
 Rap it get your face stuck on them bricks 
 I don't really like to exercise but I'll push up on a bitch 
 Y'all sweet like 99 bananas 
 That's why I got 99 niggaz wit 99 hammers 
 They all want a nigga to stop 
 'Cause I rap slick enough to slip the ring off of Vivica Fox 
 I'm just a playa that found out where the cokes know 
 That's why I'mma be around longer than the Oprah show 
 You and your man y'all both should know 
 That all it takes is a finger to send you where the ghosts go 
 Shit I been hated since the 5th grade 
 That's why my best friend the tray pound, a ice pick, and a switch blade 
 I don't like you, you don't like me 
 It's not likely that we'll ever be friends 
 Why pretend? (Ma, Banks' back at it again) 
 I don't like you, you don't like me 
 It's not likely that we'll ever be friends 
 Why pretend? (Ma, Tony's back at it again) 
 (Tony Yayo) 
 Rule number one pick a target and study him for weeks 
 See where they rest at and lay with their peeps 
 Now you got the drop, know their daily routine 
 So the 2nd rule please leave the crime scene please 
 3rd rule pick a day, 4th rule pick a time 
 5th rule pick a fifth, 6th rule pick a nine 
 And the seventh rule make sure your sidearm sweet 
 So when the shootout you leave him 6 feet deep 
 8th meet in a fast car with disguise 
 Use a ski mask with shades on your eyes 
 9th rule don't say shit cause Po-Po listen 
 Fuck around you end up being stuck in the system 
 And the 10th rule don't put a tag on a broken heart 
 Just put a toe-tag on your mark 
 And rule number 11, you caught a body but you not a legend 
 You better watch where you heading 
 I don't like you, you don't like me 
 It's not likely that we'll ever be friends 
 Why pretend? (Ma, 50's back at it again) 
 I don't like you, you don't like me 
 It's not likely that we'll ever be friends 
 Why pretend? (Ma, 50's back at it again) 
 (50 cent) 
 Go ahead go against me I'll hurt your feelings 
 Stones in my cross the size of your earrings 
 My confidence level's high nigga can't tell 
 Licking my lips at yo' bitch like I'm L L 
 I smile like a nigga in jail receiving mail 
 Better yet like nigga Bookers that made bail 
 From day one I came in the game they said I was hot 
 They got scared, "Cent got money", and I got shot 
 You so much pressure on me when you compare me to Pac 
 I'm just a new kid, I can't help that I'm hot 
 What little niggaz say to 50 cent don't matter 
 I'll fire shots at the ship and watch the seas scatter 
 My enemies never turn into friends, my friends turn into enemies 
 You scared then get the fuck around me 
 Record execs, know not to play with my check 
 I come through with my knife cut that vein on ur neck (Yeah!) 
 I don't like you, you don't like me 
 It's not likely that we'll ever be friends 
 Why pretend? (Ma, 50's back at it again) 
 I don't like you, you don't like me 
 It's not likely that we'll ever be friends 
 Why pretend? (Ma, 50's back at it again)
