G-Unit, what 
 We in here, what 
 We can get the drama popping 
 We don't care, what, what, what 
 It's going down, what 
 'Cause I'm around, what 
 50 Cent, you know how I gets down 
 What up, blood? What 
 What up, 'cause? What 
 What up, blood? What 
 What up, gangsta? 
 What up, blood? What 
 What up, 'cause? What 
 What up, blood? What 
 What up, gangsta? 
 They say I walk around like got an "S" on my chest 
 Now, that's a semi-auto, and a vest on my chest 
 I try not to say nothing, the DA might want to play in court 
 But I'll hunt or duck a nigga down like it's sport 
 Front on me, I'll cut ya, gun-butt ya or bump ya 
 You getting money? I can't none with ya then fuck ya 
 I'm not the type to get knocked for D.W.I. 
 I'm the type that'll kill your connect when the coke price rise 
 Gangstas, they bump my shit then they know me 
 I grew up around some niggas that's not my homies 
 Hundred G's I stash it, the mack I blast it 
 D's come we dump the diesel and battery acid 
 This flow's been mastered, the ice I flash it 
 Chokes me, I'll have your mama picking out your casket, bastard 
 I'm on the next level, right lane forget bezzle 
 Benz pedal to the metal, hotter than a tea kettle, God, what 
 What up, blood? What 
 What up, 'cause? What 
 What up, blood? What 
 What up, gangsta? 
 What up, blood? What 
 What up, 'cause? What 
 What up, blood? What 
 What up, gangsta? 
 We don't play that 
 We don't play that 
 We don't play that 
 (G-Unit) 
 We don't play around 
 I sit back, twist the best bud, burn and wonder 
 When gangstas bump my shit, can they hear my hunger? 
 When the 5th kick, duck quick, it sounds like thunder 
 In December I'll make your block feel like summer 
 The rap critics say I can rhyme, the fiends say my dope is a nine 
 Every chick I fuck with is a dime 
 I'm like Patty LaBelle, homie, I'm on my own 
 Where I lay my hat is my home, I'm a rolling stone 
 Cross my path I'll crush ya, thinking I won't touch ya 
 I'll have your ass using a wheelchair, cane, or crutches 
 Industry hoe fuckers, in the hood they love us 
 Stomp a bone out your ass with some brand new chuckas 
 What up, blood? What 
 What up, 'cause? What 
 What up, blood? What 
 What up, gangsta? 
 What up, blood? What 
 What up, 'cause? What 
 What up, blood? What 
 What up, gangsta?
