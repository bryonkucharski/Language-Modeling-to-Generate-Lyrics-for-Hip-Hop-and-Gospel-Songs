50 Cent: 
 Yeah, let's take 'em back 
 Comin' up, I was confused, my mommy kissin' a girl 
 Confusion occurs comin' up in the cold world 
 Daddy ain't around, probably out committin' felonies 
 My favorite rapper used to sing, "Check, check out my melody" 
 I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope 
 Four, four finger ring, one of them gold ropes 
 Lana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat 
 If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope 
 Tossed and turned in my sleep that night 
 Woke up the next mornin', niggaz had stole my bike 
 Different day, same shit, ain't nuttin' good in the hood 
 I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could 
 50 Cent, (The Game): 
 Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top 
 And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stop 
 Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P. 
 And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me 
 Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top 
 And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stop 
 Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P. 
 And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me 
 The Game: 
 I told Dre from the gate, I'd carry the heat for ya 
 First mix tape song, I'd inherited beef for ya 
 Gritted my teeth for ya, G-G-G-G for ya 
 Put Compton on my back when you was in need of soldiers 
 At my last show, I threw away my NWA gold 
 And had the whole crowd yellin' 'Free Yayo' 
 So niggas better get up outta mine 
 Fo' I creep and turn your projects into Columbine 
 And I'm Raps MVP 
 Don't make me remind y'all what happened in DC 
 This nigga ain't Gotti, he pretend 
 Mad at us 'cause Ashanti got a new boyfriend 
 And it seems your little rat turned out to be a mouse 
 This beef shit is for the birds and the birds fly south 
 Even Young Buck could vouch, when the dotch was out 
 Who gave the West Coast mouth to mouth? 
 50 Cent, (Lloyd Banks): 
 Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top 
 And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stop 
 Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P. 
 And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me 
 Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top 
 And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stop 
 Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P. 
 And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me 
 50 Cent: 
 From the beginnin' to the end, losers lose 
 Winners win this is real we ain't got to pretend 
 The cold world that we in, is full of pressure and pain 
 I thought it would change, it's staying the same 
 Lloyd Banks: 
 How many of them boys is with you? 
 When you had that little TV you had to hit on to get a picture 
 I'm walking with the snub 
 'Cause, niggas do alot of slip talking in the club 
 Till they coughin' on the rug 
 I ain't ever had much but a walkman and a bud 
 My role model is gone, snortin' up his drug 
 I've had enough, they want me to choke 
 My boy just got poked in the throat 
 Now it's an R.I.P. shirt and my coat 
 Now I'm seein', reminiscin' 
 All of my weed here, never listen 
 If I see him, then I'mma lift him 
 And maybe I oughta even the score 
 But if not, It'll be me on the floor 
 50 Cent, (Tony Yayo): 
 Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top 
 And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stop 
 Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P. 
 And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me 
 Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top 
 And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stop 
 Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P. 
 And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me 
 Tony Yayo: 
 I started out at 15 scared as hell 
 I took 30 off a pack and I made them sales 
 As a youth, man I used to hustle for loot 
 With that Lou Deuce Deuce and my Triple Phat Goose 
 Sippin' Easy Jesus, rockin' the Leases 
 Mama whip me when she find my pieces 
 I look back on life and think God I'm blessed 
 We the best on the planet so forget the rest 
 Young Buck: 
 You know I'm still nice with my cook game 
 Look Mayne, It's a hood thang 
 That's why I'm loved in Brooklayne 
 I handle mine just like a real nigga should 
 If I do some time, homie I'm still all good 
 Let me show you what a thug bout born to die 
 I take the bullets out of 50, put 'em in my 4-5 
 And I ain't even got my feet wet yet 
 A seven-figure nigga who ain't seen a royalty check 
 50 Cent, (Young Buck): 
 Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top 
 And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stop 
 Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P. 
 And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me 
 Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top 
 And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stop 
 Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P. 
 And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me
