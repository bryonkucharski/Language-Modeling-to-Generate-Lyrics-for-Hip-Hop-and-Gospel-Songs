 Ya heard me?

 Ya heard me? 
 Clothes off face down ass up c'mon 
 Shorty you roll with the winners right 
 Ya heard me? 
 You see now me I got my money right 
 Ya heard me? 
 I'm tryin' to teach you how to play, how the big boys play 
 When you come around my way 
 Ya heard me? 
 You see the Bentley got the 20 inch crome 
 Ya heard me? 
 You could get in but don't touch the phone 
 Ya heard me? 
 Money come money go I know 
 But every time I flow it's mo money fa sho 
 Ya heard me? 
 In the street niggas sayin' I'm nice 
 Ya heard me? 
 Watch flooded no more room for ice 
 Ya heard me? 
 Niggas be on TV struttin' hard 
 And in the hood the same niggas that be gettin' robbed 
 Ya heard me? 
 You might hear I get shot but I don't get robbed 
 Cause me, I be on my jog 
 You like it when I back that ass up on you?

 When I work that ass, that ass

 And baby I like it, I like it

 Everytime we dance you make it worth my while 
 And baby I like it, I like it 
 Shorty if you wanna roll with some ballers and shot callers 
 I wanna make sure you hear me

 We rap now we rollin' and I'm holdin' 
 And I'm gonna make sure you hear me

 Ya heard me? 
 Last thing I need is to catch a new case 
 I don't know nothing about them high heads but I sell base 
 Ya heard me? 
 The city boys trying to kill a kid 
 Ya heard me? 
 Shot me up in front of my crib 
 Ya heard me? 
 He had the drop I couldn't run from him 
 Shot in the hand trying to take the fucking gun from him 
 Ya heard me? 
 Little homie saying "50 you tough" 
 Ya heard me?

 Ya heard me? 
 Don't play wit the money, no not with the money 
 Niggas get knocked when they start playing games 
 Ya heard me? 
 Stop telling the police my name 
 Ya heard me? 
 I don't mind givin' chicks them tips 
 Ya heard me? 
 They let me play with then tits and hips 
 Ya heard me? 
 When I come through they know I'm a thug 
 Out in Atlanta in the gentlemen's club 
 Ya heard me? 
 I rap but I'm still selling them o's 
 Ya heard me? 
 My man Mike still pimpin' them hoes 
 Ya heard me? 
 He said if the hoe knew better she'd come do better 
 And make a pimp more chedder 
 Ya heard me? 
 (50 Cent)

 I'm speaking clearly so you can hear me 
 I come through niggas always show me love 
 I'm speaking clearly so y'all can hear me 
 Niggas want beef, y'all could see me in the street 
 I'm speaking clearly so you can hear me 
 But you better come correct, 'cause we move around with heat 
 I'm speaking clearly so y'all can hear me
