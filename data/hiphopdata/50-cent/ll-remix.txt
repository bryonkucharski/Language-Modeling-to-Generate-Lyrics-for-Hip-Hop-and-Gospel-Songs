Yeah, new 50, London, London 
 When I come up in the club with my nine 
 I'll be frontin' for the hoes with my shine 
 Tell the shorty I don't do this all the time 
 But I'll buy her ass a drink 'cause she fine 
 You know usually a nigga don't trick 
 But I really wanna get you in my six 
 Be a freak for me, shorty, suck the dick 
 If it's really good, I'll be done quick 
 Girl, you know every time you come around 
 Your London, London Bridge is going down 
 Your London, London, London wanna go down like 
 I'm comin', comin', comin' in your mouth 
 Girl, you know every time you come around 
 Your London, London Bridge is going down 
 Your London, London, London wanna go down like 
 I'm comin', comin', comin' in your mouth 
 Oh shit, the Grey Goose, man, I'm mixin' that with juice 
 The Red Bull that I did it as a boost 
 First I was showin', now a nigga is confused 
 So many bitches up in here I can choose 
 Now I don't know which one I'ma pick 
 They ride with me in my Bentley [Incomprehensible] 
 And when you spit the kinda G I spit 
 You could leave it to a three and shit 
 Girl, you know every time you come around 
 Your London, London Bridge is going down 
 Your London, London, London wanna go down like 
 I'm comin', comin', comin' in your mouth 
 Girl, you know every time you come around 
 Your London, London Bridge is going down 
 Your London, London, London wanna go down like 
 I'm comin', comin', comin' in your mouth 
 Me like a bullet type, you know they comin' right 
 Fergie love 'em long time, my girls support right? 
 Me like a bullet type, you know they comin' right 
 Fergie love 'em long time, my girls support right? 
 When I come to the clubs, step aside 
 Part the seas, don't be havin' me in the line 
 V.I.P. 'cause you know I gotta shine 
 I'm Fergie Ferg and me love you long time 
 All my girls get down on the floor 
 Back to back, drop it down real low 
 I'm such a lady but I'm dancin' like a ho 
 'Cause you know I don't give a fuck, so here we go 
 Girl, you know every time you come around 
 Your London, London Bridge is going down 
 Your London, London, London wanna go down like 
 I'm comin', comin', comin' in your mouth 
 Girl, you know every time you come around 
 Your London, London Bridge is going down 
 Your London, London, London wanna go down like 
 I'm comin', comin', comin' in your mouth
