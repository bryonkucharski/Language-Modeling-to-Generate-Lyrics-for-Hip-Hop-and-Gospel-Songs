(Chorus - Akon) 
 Don't even look at me wrong when I come through the 'hood 
 Ain't nothin' changed, still holla at my homies 
 And when I hit the block, I still will kill 
 And I don't want, nigga but I will 
 If I got to, kill 
 If niggas get to fuckin' around, if niggas get to fuckin' around 
 (Verse 1 - 50 Cent) 
 Respect come from admiration and fear 
 You can admire if you can catch one in ya wig 
 You see the Testarosa the toaster's right on my lap 
 So if a nigga get out of line a nigga get clapped 
 I got an arsenal a infantry, I'm built for this mentally 
 That's why I'm the general, I do what they pretend to do 
 Front on me now nigga I'll be the end of you 
 Forget ya enemies and think of what'cha friends'll do 
 I drop a bag off, then let a mag off 
 The Heckler and Koch'll tear half of ya ass off 
 I'm not for the games I'm not for all the playin' 
 The hollow tips rain, when I unleash the pain 
 Get the message from the lions or get the message from the nine 
 Paint a picture wit' words, you can see when I shine 
 Put my back on the wall nigga watch me go for mine 
 I let twenty-one shots off at the same time, yeah 
 (Chorus - Akon) 
 (Verse 2 - 50 Cent) 
 Where I'm from death is always in the air homie 
 Nanna love me so you know she say my prauers for me 
 I come creepin' through in the 'hood wearin' teflon 
 Hit the corners muthafuckas get left on 
 Niggas know, if not they better check my background 
 Try and stick me I fill ya back wit' mac rounds 
 Ask 'Preme nigga 50 don't back down 
 I keep it funky like fiends in a crack house 
 Cross the line boy I'mma air ya ass out 
 Screw ya face at me I wan' know what that's 'bout 
 Nigga I know you ain't mad I done came up 
 And if you are, fuck you 'cause I ain't change up 
 The O.G.'s wanna talk but I don't know these niggas 
 And I ain't did no business wit' 'em I don't owe these niggas 
 A minute of my time, I get it 'cause I grind 
 All across the world like the globe's mine, yeah! 
 (Chorus - Akon) 
 (Verse 3 - Akon) 
 Konvict 
 Now tell me have you ever looked up at an instance 
 And seen a mac aimin' at'cha head mayne? 
 Before you know it life is flashin' reminiscin' 
 And ya body is drippin' and full of lead mayne 
 I done been there, I done cocked that 
 It ain't never been a question I'm 'bout that 
 Don't go there, ya can cock that 
 And if ya plan to fuck around then reroute that 
 You never catch me ridin' around on these streets 
 Without a couple metal pieces under my feet 
 Fully automatic weapons and loaded wit' dumb-d's 
 Stashed up under the carpet like a can of Seabreeze 
 50 don't make me ride on these niggas 
 'Cause I will kill, dip and hide on these niggas 
 50 don't make me ride on these niggas 
 'Cause I'll be long gone like the Ripper, so 
 (Chorus - Akon)
