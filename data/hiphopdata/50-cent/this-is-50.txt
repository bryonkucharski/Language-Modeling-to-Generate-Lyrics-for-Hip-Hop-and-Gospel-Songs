This is 50 
 I don't know what you take me for 
 I really don't play that shit 
 I ain't got to get you hit 
 I get out myself and spray that shit 
 I got a itchy itchy trigger finger, nigga it's a killa in me not to spray that shit 
 I got enough ammo shots to blow I up a hole in every mothafucka out this bitch 
 I unload then reload, when you get hit I supposed you gon' be strong enough to take this shit 
 I'm in the hood ridin' round with a chrome fo' pound, can you see through the windows see tints 
 I do dirt, the gat bussa, get to kickin' up dust, 'fore the jakes come around here kid 
 Niggas get knocked if they start askin' question, my name end up in all types of shit 
 I be a gangsta, nigga till I die fo' sho', whether I'm poor or I'm filthy rich 
 Now what you know about movin' that Peruvian flake for that cake, I get rid of them bricks 
 I don't know what you take me for 
 I really don't play that shit 
 I ain't got to get you hit 
 I get out myself and spray that shit 
 Man I gotta have shoes, you know chrome 22's, every time I get a brand new whip 
 I rolled around in a 5, till my money got right, then I went back and got that six 
 I'm in a big white Benz, on a hot sunny day, I call up the milk truck and shit 
 I have ya hoe, eyeballin' at the light, damn pimpin', you should take time to check that bitch 
 You'l find me ridin' through the hood, actin' like it's all good, but I'm lookin' for a ??? and shit 
 In the middle of the night, you can turn on ya lights, I mean my niggas in ya crib 
 Nigga holla if there's a problem, and your niggas got drama, I got burners for sell and shit 
 Got the macs, got the nines, got them tecks all the time, holo-tips and the extra clips 
 I don't know what you take me for 
 I really don't play that shit 
 I ain't got to get you hit 
 I get out myself and spray that shit 
 Man I'm tired of tellin' niggas over and over everything about me be gangsta 
 Man I'm tired of tellin' niggas over and over I won't hesitate to pop or shank ya 
 Man I'm tired of tellin' niggas over and over they can hustle and I'm in your shit 
 Man I'm tired of tellin' niggas over and over you don't listen you gon' get ya ass hit 
 This is 50

 Like the water you drink 
 Like the air you breathe 
 You need me to live
