50 Cent: 
 R.I.P. B.I.G. man y'all niggas have some audacity 
 Sell four mill then get half of me 
 Get off my dick 
 I'm the shit 
 I know y'all niggas copying my style 
 (Chorus: 50 Cent) 
 They stay at home 
 All alone 
 In the zone 
 Bumpin' 50's shit 
 That gangsta music 
 It makes 'em wanna grab the chrome 
 And just roam 
 On they own 
 And do it how the gangstas do it 
 50 Cent: 
 You niggas want problems you all welcome 
 Franks not around anymore 
 New Yorks mine 
 (Verse 1: 50 Cent) 
 Blood set, Crip set 
 Gangsta, respect 
 I give niggas the green light to get ya whole click wet 
 You been rappin' a long time you ain't got chips yet 
 You had that ounce a whole week nigga you ain't flip yet 
 Before I leave the crib I make sure I don't forget shit 
 Mac check 
 Clip check 
 Vest check 
 I'm ready to roll 
 Its no contest I'm the Codeez from the East 
 Niggas mad I'm doin' good so I wake up to new beef 
 Niggas sayin' "I knew 50 back when he was Boo" 
 "When he used to pump crack on Guy Brew" 
 "Before he blew" 
 Then when they come through 
 Sayin' what's up I'm like "Who are you" 
 We ain't ever made no money together so we ain't cool 
 Cocaine, baking soda, a pot full of boiling water I'll teach you how to cook crack 
 Nigga how you like that? 
 Turn a buck into a stack 
 Man I mean a G-Stack 
 Just took it from 3 and a half to 14 you peep that 
 Smoke shit, pop shit on the low nigga 
 We roll shit, smoke shit pass the dro nigga 
 (Chorus: 50 Cent) 
 They stay at home 
 All alone 
 In the zone 
 Bumpin' 50's shit 
 That gangsta music 
 It makes 'em wanna grab the chrome 
 And just roam 
 On they own 
 And do it how the gangstas do it 
 50 Cent: 
 Yeah man keep it real gangsta 
 You know what I'm sayin'? 
 November 4th G Unit album in stores 
 November 4th G Unit sneakers in stores 
 Its goin' down like that you know what I'm sayin'? 
 Silverback Gorillas in the concrete jungle baby 
 You gotta love it
