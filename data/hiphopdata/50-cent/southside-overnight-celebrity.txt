Yeah man 
 Fuck the hood man 
 Fuck that I been tryin' to get away from that muthafucker for a long time man.I'm happy y'all niggas is mad man.Your frown makes me smile. 
 Y'all niggas know me man. 
 It is what it is man. 
 Like I say y'all know me 
 I be on the scene on the lean on a benz in tha bently, when I come throuh your strip. 
 Every trip every flip I get the grip. 
 I can go to the dealership and buy me a new whip. 
 Take fix 
 New kicks 
 G6 
 New tricks I pick to suck on my dick. 
 G-Unit is the clique 
 And it's how it gets flipped 
 That's why you feelin' me bitch. 
 Niggas hate from a far 
 But they don't come around. 
 'Cause they know how a nigga get down. 
 Once a nigga move around 
 Wit a long trey pound. 
 I won't hesitate to let it off 6 rounds. 
 If yo ass get hit 
 Then you ain't do shit 
 Fuckin' wit me that's what you get. 
 Now your lip 
 Keep it zip 
 Before you get your babymama 
 Caught up in this bullshit 
 Now what gets 
 It's a no no 
 Niggas on 
 Lo go 
 But they tryin' to stay on the LOE DOE 
 Gangsta fo sho 
 Every time a nigga flow 
 A nigga bank acount got 
 Mo' Dough
