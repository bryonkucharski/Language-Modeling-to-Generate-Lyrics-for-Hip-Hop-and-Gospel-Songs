Hoo, Yeah, it's 50 a.k.a Ferrari F-50 
 Break it down 
 I got a lot of living to do before I die 
 And I ain't got time to waste, let's make it 
 You said you were a gangsta but you never pop nothin' 
 We said you were a Wanksta and you need to stop frontin' 
 You ain't a friend of mine, you ain't no kin of mine 
 What makes you think that I'ma run up on you with the nine 
 We do this all the time, right now we on the grind 
 So hurry up and copy go selling nicks and dimes 
 Shorty she's so fine, I gotta make her mine 
 A ass like that gotta be one of a kind 
 I crush 'em every time, punch 'em with every line 
 I'm fucking with they mind, I make them press rewind 
 They know they can't shine if I'm around the rhyme 
 Been on parole since '94 'cause I commit the crime 
 I send you my line, I did a three to nine 
 If D's ran up in my crib, you know who droppin' dimes 
 You said you were a gangsta but you never pop nothin' 
 We said you were a wanksta and you need to stop frontin' 
 You go with the dealership, but you never cop nothin' 
 You been hustlin' a long time, and you ain't got nothin' 
 You said you were a gangsta but you never pop nothin' 
 We said you were a wanksta and you need to stop frontin' 
 You go with the dealership, but you never cop nothin' 
 You been hustlin' a long time, and you ain't got nothin' 
 Damn homie, in high school you was the man, homie 
 What the fuck happened you? 
 I got the sickest vendetta, when it come to the chedda 
 Nigga you play with my paper, you gonna meet my berretta 
 Now shorty think I'ma sweat her, sippin' on amoretta 
 I'm livin' once then deada, I know I can do betta' 
 She look good but I know she after my chedda 
 She tryin' to get in my pockets, homie and I ain't gonna let her 
 Be easy, start some bullshit, you get your whole crew wet 
 We're in the club doing the same old two step 
 Guerilla unit 'cause they say we bugged out 
 'Cause we don't go nowhere without toast we thugged out 
 You said you were a gangsta but you never pop nothin' 
 We said you were a wanksta and you need to stop frontin' 
 You go with the dealership, but you never cop nothin' 
 You been hustlin' a long time, and you ain't got nothin' 
 You said you were a gangsta but you never pop nothin' 
 We said you were a wanksta and you need to stop frontin' 
 You go with the dealership, but you never cop nothin' 
 You been hustlin' a long time, and you ain't got nothin' 
 Me I'm no mobsta', me I'm no gangsta' 
 Me I'm no hitman, me I'm just me, me 
 Me I'm no wanksta', me I'm no acta' 
 But it's me you see on your TV 
 'Cause I hustle baby, this rap shit is so easy 
 I'm gettin' what you get for a brick to talk greasy 
 By any means, partner, I got to eat on these streets 
 If you play me close, for sure I'm gonna pop my heat 
 Niggas sayin' they gonna murda 50, how? 
 We ridin' 'round with guns the size of Lil Bow Wow 
 What you know about AK's and AR 15's? 
 Equipped with night vision, shell catchers and dem things, huh 
 You said you were a gangsta but you never pop nothin' 
 We said you were a wanksta and you need to stop frontin' 
 You go with the dealership, but you never cop nothin' 
 You been hustlin' a long time, and you ain't got nothin' 
 You said you were a gangsta but you never pop nothin' 
 We said you were a wanksta and you need to stop frontin' 
 You go with the dealership, but you never cop nothin' 
 You been hustlin' a long time, and you ain't got nothin' 
 Damn homie
