The top feels so much better than the bottom 
 So much better 
 Clean version: 
 Ja you's a window shopper 
 Mad at me, I think I know why 
 Jada you's a window shopper 
 In the jewelery store, looking at shit you can't buy 
 Joe you's a window shopper 
 In the dealership, trying get a test drive 
 Nas you's a window shopper 
 Mad as fuck when you see me ride by 
 Dirty version: 
 Nigga you's a window shopper 
 Mad at me, I think I know why 
 Nigga you's a window shopper 
 In the jewelery store, looking at shit you can't buy 
 Nigga you's a window shopper 
 In the dealership, trying to get a test drive 
 Nigga you's a window shopper 
 Mad as fuck when you see me ride by 
 Summertime white porche carrera is milky 
 I'm on the grind let my paper stack when I'm filthy 
 Funny how a nigga get the screw facing at me 
 Anyhow, they ain't got the heart to get at me 
 I'll get down, southsides the hood that I come from 
 So I don't cruise to nobodys hood without my gun 
 You know the kid ain't gonna follow that bullshit 
 Try and stick me imma let off a full clip 
 It ain't my fault you done fucked up your re-up 
 At the dice game who told you put a G up 
 Everybody mad when their paper don't stack right 
 When I come around y'all niggas better act right 
 When we got the tops down, you can hear the system thump 
 When we rollin' rollin' rollin' 
 Shut your block down, quick to put a hole in a chump 
 Nigga When we rollin' rollin' rollin' 
 Niggas Love me in L.A. as soon as I pop in 
 They come scoop me up in LAX and I hop in 
 When it comes to bad bitches you know I got them 
 Some from Long Beach, some from Watts, some from Compton 
 You know a nigga wanna see how cali girls freak off 
 After that 5 hour flight from New York 
 I start spitting G at a bitch like a pimp man 
 Tell her meet me at The Mondrian so we can do our thing 
 She can bring the lingerie with her I suppose 
 And we can go from fully dressed to just having no clothes 
 She can run and tell her best friend bout my sex game 
 Her best friend could potentially be next man 
 Listen man, shit changed 
 I came up from doing my thang 
 Homey I'm holing, holing, holing 
 Shit man, the store owner watching you 
 For something get stolen, stolen, stolen
