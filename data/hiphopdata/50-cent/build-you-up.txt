Yeah uh huh 
 I like the way that feel) 
 I built you up, what 
 If ever I fall down 
 N' I need you to pick me up 
 Promise me you be around 
 Hold me down 
 I build you up 
 Listen if you let me, I'll b the reason you shine 
 It's a secret, I want the world to know dat you mine 
 But on sum real shit, communications could be better 
 So I'm writin' this song instead of a love letter. 
 They gon play it on da radio a hundred times a day 
 I figure, when you hear it, you gon stop 'n' think of me 
 I wanna get to know you, and b the reason you Smile 
 Girl you know where I'm from, you know how I get Down 
 When times are tough, tell me dat I'm special 
 Not rap, I mean me, dat I'm special 
 You know they say diamonds are a girls best friend 
 Precious stones, could you put me befo' them 
 If so, I'll see to it dat they'll always around 
 Nothin', but da best, now how does dat sound 
 If I drop a jewel when we talk, you can keep it 
 Girl, you on my mind all da time, dat's a secret, shhhh 
 Baby, I build you up 
 Girl, if I, have a show, I'd have you by my side 
 Girl, I build you up 
 Girl, I need to know fa sho, you mine 
 Girl, I need to know fa sho, you mine 
 Girl I think about you hopin' that you feel tha same way, 
 Or is it just ma imagination again runnin' away? 
 If you ready to ride, girl come on, let's roll 
 G5, how I fly, 'ma lets go 
 It was hard to measure da pleasure of havin' you in my presence 
 Yo smile makes me smile, I show you my style 
 We can shop a lil bit, I'll pick out sum shit 
 One pair at a time, till yo shoe game sick 
 Now who knows, what the future holds 
 We be together prolly, fo betta or for worse 
 Like Whitney and Bobby 
 If you wanna play house, we can play house then 
 But wait... why pretend when you can move in 
 Befo I'll be yo buddy in bed, lemme be yo best friend 
 Girl it's mo' then lust, I want yo trust 
 You keep it reel wit me, I keep it reel wit'chu 
 'Cause I know wit'chu by my side, there's nothin' I can't do 
 Baby, I build you up 
 Girl, if I, have a show, I'd have you by my side 
 Girl, I build you up 
 Girl, I need to know fa sho, you mine 
 When you up when you down 
 If you smile, if you frown 
 I'll b wit'chu baby 
 La La La... 
 Baby, I build you up 
 Girl, if I, have a show, I'd have you by my side 
 Girl, I build you up 
 Girl, I need to know fa sho, you mine 
 When you up when you down 
 If you smile, if you frown 
 I'll b wit'chu baby 
 La La La...
