You ain't strong enough nigga 
 You probably go against me and win 
 But you, you don't stand a chance nigga 
 I do more than talk that, I motherfuckin' walk that 
 Blue Yankee cap back, fuck around get clapped at 
 I sleep with the stainless, I walk with the stainless 
 Man, everybody know about 50, I'm famous 
 New York, New York, I run New York 
 Ask Dread at the weed spot, I come through in the mean drop 
 In different boroughs I have different moments 
 On different days niggas know how I'm on it 
 I'm pretty like a Harlem nigga 
 I'm a shooter like a Brooklyn nigga 
 I'm a hustler don't get no bigger 
 Queens, South Side 'til they bury me 
 BX two tek's, flames out the nozzles 
 R1 one wheel, Christian Dior goggles 
 Spar with me start some shit send the shooters out 
 Come out the club we out front with the Rugers out 
 Nah, ain't no sense to talkin' peace my brother 
 That beef will probably send your monkey ass to see Allah 
 These niggas ain't strong enough, their money ain't long enough 
 When they bump heads with me they find out the guns do bust 
 We getting' paper in God we trust 
 These sucker ass niggas 
 These niggas ain't strong enough, their money ain't long enough 
 When they bump heads with me they find out the guns do bust 
 We getting' paper in God we trust 
 Suck on this nigga 
 When I said I'll kill ya, I'll kill ya 
 As a kid I wasn't kiddin' then 
 Special ed kid in the back on Ritalin 
 Crib all fucked up, hooptie all fucked up 
 Pockets all fucked up, now nigga wassup? 
 I'm rich now, niggas know about my dividends 
 Look at the Raw Report, check out what I'm livin' in 
 Fuck a spot now, I'm 'bout to buy a yacht now 
 Crib the size of the New York City clock now 
 Okay, okay, try me and get shot down 
 I'm like a zebra, I got so many stripes 
 I'm the fuckin' general, I run my clique right 
 It was five of us, all of us millionaires 
 Now one's a fuckin' junkie and one's a fuckin' queer 
 Now it's three of us, that's the way we started 
 They call me crazy, cold blooded and black hearted 
 I don't play no games, niggas beg for mercy 
 Then we T-O-S, put that ass to rest 
 These niggas ain't strong enough, their money ain't long enough 
 When they bump heads with me they find out the guns do bust 
 We gettin' paper in God we trust 
 These sucker ass niggas 
 These niggas ain't strong enough, their money ain't long enough 
 When they bump heads with me they find out the guns do bust 
 We gettin' paper in God we trust 
 Suck on this nigga
