 She ain't that chick from the burbs that's a stranger to the drama 
 She that uptown girl with the cocky persona 
 Went out a way to let her know that I want her 
 I tell her I know fo' sho we belong togetha 
 And I wouldn't break her heart my intentions are betta 
 And I shared the same dreams she had about chedda 
 When the D's came she was down to hold the berretta 
 I got a thing for baby girl 
 It's me and her against the world, whooooo 
 (Justin Timberlake) 
 You were my sun, you were my earth 
 But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no 
 So you took a chance and made other plans 
 But I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no 
 You don't have to say what you did, 
 I already know, I found out from him 
 Now there's just no chance for you and me, there'll never be 
 And don't it make you sad about it 
 You told me you loved me, why did you leave me all alone? 
 Now you tell me you need me when you call me on the phone 
 Girl, I refuse, you must have me confused with some other guy 
 Your bridges were burned and now it's your turn to cry 
 Cry me a river, cry me a river-er 
 Cry me a river, cry me a river-er, yeah, yeah 
 I know that they say that some things are better left unsaid 
 It wasn't like you only talked to him and you know it (don't act like you don't know it) 
 And all of these things people told me keep messing with my head (messing with my head) 
 You should've picked honesty, then you may not have blown it (yeah...) 
 You don't have to say what you did (don't have to say what you did) 
 I already know, I found out from him (I already know, uh) 
 Now there's just no chance for you and me, there'll never be (no chance, you and me) 
 And don't it make you sad about it 
 You told me you loved me, why did you leave me all alone? (all alone) 
 Now you tell me you need me when you call me on the phone (when you call me on the phone) 
 Girl, I refuse, you must have me confused with some other guy (I'm not like them, baby) 
 Your bridges were burned and now it's your turn (it's your turn) to cry 
 Cry me a river (go on and just) 
 Cry me a river-er (go on and just) 
 Cry me a river (baby go on and just) 
 Cry me a river-er, yeah, yeah 
 (Timbaland) 
 Oh (oh!), the damage is done, so I guess I be leaving 
 Oh (oh!), the damage is done, so I guess I be leaving 
 Oh (oh!), the damage is done, so I guess I be leaving 
 Oh (oh!), the damage is done, so I guess I be... l-l-l-leaving 
 (Justin Timberlake) 
 You don't have to say what you did (don't have to say what you did) 
 I already know, I found out from him (I already know, uh) 
 Now there's just no chance for you and me, there'll never be (no chance, you and me) 
 And don't it make you sad about it 
 Cry me a river (go on and just) 
 Cry me a river-er (baby, go on and just) 
 Cry me a river (you can go on and just) 
 Cry me a river-er, yeah, yeah 
 Cry me a river (baby, go on and just) 
 Cry me a river-er (go on and just) 
 Cry me a river ('cause I've already cried) 
 Cry me a river-er, yeah, yeah (ain't gonna cry, no more, yeah-yeah)

 Your smile make my day, it's simple your dimples 
 Your eyes, your lips, your thighs got me hypnotized 
 Communications deep, I love it when we talk 
 Hatin' when you leave, but when you leave I love to watch you walk 
 You make a nigga forget about a life full of drama 
 She got expensive taste, she get it from her momma 
 Materialistic, still a nigga want her 
 Consistently missin' her touch when she gone 
 She smell like Chanel she feelin' me and I can tell 
 With the right woman by my side I feel like I can't fail 
 I've been around, been up and down, my attitude is fuck her now 
 She a rider, I feel like heaven when I'm inside her 
 Workin' up a sweat kissin' on her neck 
 12 play in the deck 4 play correct, have her drippin' wet 
 She looked in my eyes and said she liked it, but I knew she loved it 
 I just keep doin' what I'm doin' and think nothin' of it
