(Feat. Tony Yayo) 
 You betta watch yo back, muthafuckas is grimey down here 
 You get stuck up, stabbed, shot the fuck up round here 
 Son I move wit my vest and my hammer, I don't care 
 Niggas try and front on me and I'm blastin 'em right here 
 You betta watch yo back, niggas be on dat bullshit down here 
 So I gotta move round wit a full clip round here 
 Lil sneaky mufuckas will pull shit round here 
 Next thing you know you wakin' up... 
 50 cent: 
 When I say I'll lay a nigga down I put that on my momma 
 Niggas gonna see it's real when we get in the dramma 
 I ain't fightin wit these faggots ima back out the lamma 
 And start lettin off until niggas is no longer problems 
 I watch the blood seep in the street, I'm swift wit the heat 
 I hit a nigga quick, Know why? niggas hit me 
 They call me 50 my aka is two gun Charlie 
 Find me up at 4 in the mornin to catch me a body 
 Waitin for you in yo projects by your staircase door 
 Come out! Come out! pussy you can't hide from a war 
 I get impatient then I'm bringin' it to yo people, I ring the doorbell then I'm putin one through your peephole 
 Boy it's a no, no to fuck wit me 'cause I'm not your equal, 
 They say I'm loco, the pump will make your fuckin' chest see-through 
 But on the low though I'll show you how them hollow tips eat through, your legs, your back, your head and your hat 
 You betta watch yo back, muthafuckas is grimey down here 
 You get stuck up, stabbed, shot the fuck up round here 
 Son I move wit my vest and my hammer, I don't care 
 Niggas try and front on me and I'm blastin 'em right here 
 You betta watch yo back, niggas be on dat bullshit down here 
 So I gotta move round wit a full clip round here

 Tony Yayo: 
 When I'm gunnin at yo ass wit the chrome kid you runnin' outta town like a boost mobil phone 
 Yeah the tech jam but it really don't shoot bad, I'll turn yo head into a fishnet doorag 
 I got bricks of that raw sittin' in that rice mayn and a long fo'fo when I'm at da dice game 
 You won't catch me slippin when I'm hittin them licks, I roll 4, 5, 6 wit my hand on my shit 
 I'm a gangsta on point ready to flip, fo you dummys I got dum dums all in my clip 
 I got bundles of that D man I'm tryin' to get paid, so I'm makin' moves fast like my name was D. Wade 
 You betta watch yo back, muthafuckas is grimey down here 
 You get stuck up, stabbed, shot the fuck up round here
