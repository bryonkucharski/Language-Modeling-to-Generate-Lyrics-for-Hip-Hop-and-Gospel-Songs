Hey, pass that nigga, we gettin' high 
 Yo, yo this is some bomb shit right here man 
 50 can't even smoke this motherfucker 
 I can't smoke weed, 'cause my PO make me piss in a cup 
 Nigga go ahead, disrespect me, I'll fuck you up 
 I ain't talkin' about a fist fight, I'll cut you up 
 Yo don't want stitches in yo grill motherfucker then chill 
 As a young buck, niggas always knew I puff 
 You see me go to school, on a smoiler bus 
 (Woo) 
 I'm a speed kid, I'm gettin' all this paper 
 You should sit, scribble lines and see where it take ya 
 Had violent tendencies so they thought I was dumb 
 Why the so called smart kids was poppin' guns 
 I think about poppin' a gun and then get the lump sum 
 Grampa my role model, used to suck on a bottle 
 A pint a Crown Royal, make your insides boil 
 Been smell like Ben Gay, 'cause his back go out 
 He the one that taught me, what bein' blacks about 
 Now peep the roach on the walls that fall and crawl on my friend's wrist 
 Sittin' up in the Benz to be in the pen 
 In the hood we hit the number but never the lotto 
 Life in the fast lane, one wheel hit the pothole 
 Let's go, let's flow nigga 
 War, what is it good for, absolutely nothin' 
 But niggas keep frontin' 
 Fuck a nigga, live like a soldier 
 Die like a soldier 
 War, what is it good for, absolutely nothin' 
 But niggas keep frontin' 
 Fuck a nigga, live like a soldier 
 Die like a soldier 
 War, state of mercy nigga you see me pop off nigga 
 Ain't no peace talk, bitch ass nigga 
 Fake gangsta nigga, you want to seem nigga 
 (Yeah) 
 You don't seem nigga, yeah nigga 
 Right? Kay slay, Whoo Kid, 50 Cent, new shit 
 My nigga Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, G-Unit 
 Niggas, niggas, 'Rotten Apple' 
 And nigga shy money, ain't fail nigga uh huh, ya heard
