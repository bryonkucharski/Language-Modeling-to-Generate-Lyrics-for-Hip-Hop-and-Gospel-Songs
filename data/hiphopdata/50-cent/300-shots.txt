Y'all niggas spend too much time watchin' flicks 
 Who you wanna be? Tony Montana and shit? 
 Well you can start, right before his ass get hit 
 So when I walk up you can see the shotgun spit 
 Ferrari roof go down, Lam doors go up 
 I got big boy toys, when you gon' grow up? 
 Nigga knick knack pattywack, give a dog a bone 
 I'm still down to sell crack got a fiends home 
 God bless the child with a flawless flow 
 Say gave a nigga the talent to push blow 
 Like a pimp watch a hoe, I watch the grams go 
 Watch the stash grow, straight cash flow 
 I'm a hundred time bigger than Preme in his prime 
 100 mill in my account and I'm still on the grind 
 When you a'int in my clique, it's hard to shine 
 I mean talent like this is so hard to find 
 G-Unit 
 I don't dream now that I'm livin', I'm out to get it 
 My truck bomb kitted an AK can hit it 
 I'm a rap tycoon, I was fly in the whom 
 So I'm gettin' ass like a public bathroom 
 I went from Rikers Island, to shows at the garden 
 Automatic startin' in the drop got your bitch pussy fartin' 
 My album about to drop in 7 days 
 But I still poke a rapper at the VMA's 
 Kilo's in a gram, PO's be my fans 
 That's why I'm overseas doin' shows in Japan 
 I got Gats from the future, see-through guns 
 So when my bullets leave the chamber I can see you run 
 Nigga I flip my advance before I ran through it 
 'Cause that money turn haters into that barmen fluid 
 My dope be a 8, from a 1 to 10 
 Keepin' in a cool place from Uncle Ben 
 You know you messin' with a nigga that do this for a livin' 
 Put two in the street while there's two in the kitchen 
 Put guns in niggaz mouth like "Who's you dissin'?" 
 We give for they knew who you was missin', nigga 
 You can either have a gun at the chain, or one at the brain 
 I have hoes back of the church, hummin' ya name 
 Even then I feel it's like cheat my men 
 Watch God leave the sky to come and greet my men 
 I pop niggas in the chest they never breathe again 
 Route 20 in the fitness see the streets again 
 What's a man tryna wake up, who can't wake up? 
 Back guards face straight up with kinds of make up 
 'Cause every time I run, scream, pop a 3-80 
 I hear a mother scream "Please not my baby!" 
 Quick as I see it's you, bullets will hit you, boy 
 Your nobody so no one will miss you 
 Queens start to kickin', it's too much to get through 
 Leave a nigga leakin' like an Indian ritual 
 Who wanna run up on me they get known quick 
 I blackout then snatch your chrome clique 
 Leavin' jail in '91, made I'm homesick 
 Move Pow-Fu like a Farrakhan atonement 
 Raised in, caged in, let my ways spin 
 Face wrapped up like a Saudi Arabian 
 A country nigga still lookin' for a New York hoe 
 About to kill these niggas with this New York flow 
 Say one nigga name homie you gon' go 
 You in that Hot97 so New York know 
 I use to listen to Jada I've never listened to Joe 
 I couldn't tell ya how now one of his verses go 
 Seen Styles and Sheek out, doin' promo 
 I was like "What Up?" and they was like "Uh, oh" 
 I a'int just get cold, see my block been hot 
 50 give me the word, niggas would have been pop 
 Fuck a interview nigga I get into you nigga 
 Enough hearin' 'bout what you finna do nigga 
 Murder at its best, this is rap at its finest 
 You can see my verse, even if you the blindest 
 My raps is vivid, ya bitch I hit it 
 All ready, yeah that's right this is spaghetti 
 Head mob niggas, my gun bomb niggas 
 Go 'head and shoot, my pistol nuke niggas 
 When I let off, the whole earth feel the effects 
 I mix CD's and treat 'em like album shit 
 Our albums, we treat 'em like the president elections 
 On our champagne campaign livin' up dresses 
 On the dance flo' the Hennessey it flow 
 When you fuck with G-Unit then you gon' fuckin' blow 
 When you fuck with Mobb Deep, then bring some fuckin' hoes 
 'Cause it's a gang of us and we ready to go 
 'Cause after the party after the party we get so drunk 
 We forget all about the next day, hun' 
 Get it Teflon don, AK-filled 
 Get your mouth blown off like the hand that feeds you 
 Yeah little motherfucker put the hammer in diesel 
 G-Unit, Game Over, this is only a preview 
 Niggas shittin' on theyself gotta rock in the huggy 
 The coke in the pot rise to the top like dougy 
 Got chicks with a ass like Buffy, yes homie trust me 
 Plays fuck me, kick 'em out when they try to get touchy 
 QB, Southside, if you wanted to Trestle 
 Man your man is hot, you don't wanna get next to 
 Like 50's beef is mine and mine is his 
 See this serious, motherfuckin' ask them kids 
 Niggas wild on the streets, scared to death to bid 
 Sell anything that stay from the bottles and cuffs, nigga butt 
 You about to witness an M.O.P. thug out 
 And for you niggas hatin' listen to the sounds of the Unit 
 Kiss my ass with your tongue out, nigga 
 Fuck a warden, I ring bells like a doorman 
 So all you motherfuckers take it easy like Sunday mornin 
 (Get 'em up) 
 Put 'em up, wrap ya hand or knuckle up 
 Ground zero we never ran never will we fuck 'em up 
 Dude you gonna get your ass banged 
 Fuckin' with that homie Lloyd Banks 
 Wild gun style what the fuck y'all think 
 Niggas ain't got nuttin' on me, everybody know that 
 Niggas run up on a V, everybody gon' clap 
 And if he ain't what he say, an' everybody gon' rats 
 Just rat and catch your little body all rats 
 Matter'fact, I don't hang out with no lobby for rats 
 The gun swallow me back off Bacardi and Yack 
 I'm in the club with the snub, this the part of the track 
 A stray from the K will take a part of ya hat 
 I'm gettin' cake like you wouldn't believe but I'm accepted 
 By mainstream America and good in the piece 
 Now niggaz wanna talk all greasy 
 (Why) 
 Like they ain't used to open up for me in New York on TV 
 (Ya know) 
 Skip all chatter and walk off Eazy 
 A milly will make your body looker look all measly 
 Ya bitch spotted me on the dolo and I'm low-low 
 Damn near broke a monolo for a photo 
 I ain't ridin' around with a dodo that's a no-no 
 Momma taught me better than that you go to go home 
 Look at me now, a product of poverty 
 I can't watch the way I gotta decide a me 
 The 'hoods fulla hurt but that was a robbery 
 Critics owe me an apology, I'm probably 
 A sixteen away from the lottery 
 My niggas keep guns, that's one of the things I gotta be 
 I'm wrapped up in a dome shit 
 'Cause nigga got all kinds of beef they want ya to come get 
 I'm two steppin' with my weapon 'cause they don't check 'em up 
 I know niggas from 'round there and they don't check us 
 All of the niggas was fans when I met 'em 
 Just waitin' in the wind for niggas to come and get 'em 
 On my next album, I'm a have some fun wit' 'em 
 Spank 'em all around so everybody forget 'em 
 They Envy, 'cause I got the 'hood in a frenzy 
 And I move smooth with the wooden Benzy 
 Blend in, niggas will body ya for a pen 
 Baby need food, baby momma need fin 
 You know me, New York cap on 
 Batman whip that I got off a rap song 
 I'm the fan with the illegal strap on 
 Teflon an' a wife beater an' black on 
 Its on 
 Wassup? This the kid, 50 Cent, man 
 It's going down, ya heard me? 
 Niggas got me mad, ya talk, ya niggas 
 Got me all fucked up 
 I'm finna kill few of you mother fuckers man 
 Know what I'm sayin'? Watch ya niggas say 
 Somethin' smart out ya mouth, boy, you better stop usin' ya mouth 
 Before I help you not be able to use ya mouth, motherfucker
