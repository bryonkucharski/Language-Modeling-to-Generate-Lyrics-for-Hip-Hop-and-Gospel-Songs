(Feat. Mobb Deep) 
 (Chorus: 50 Cent) 
 Yeah. 
 (Look out) 
 I'm sitting on some chains 
 Big things, big diamond rings 
 MOP, man you know what we 'bout 
 So if you wanna roll, baby come on and roll 
 And if not, bitch please (look out) 
 I tear you from the rip, see me I'm 'bout to grip 
 To find things that's what I'm about 
 So if you wanna roll, baby come on and roll 
 And if not, bitch please (look out) 
 Havoc: 
 Shawty I got some thangs 
 But do you got some thangs too? 
 Pretend the table is you, able what I'm talkin' bout 
 And if I caught a case would you be on the case 
 You couldn't handle plays, bitch (look out) 
 You know Havoc, a bundled paper stuffed inside, nigga 
 To built me a mini mansion the size of an octopus 
 And the crib sittin' on stilts, take off the Stilettos 
 Get me to hug you from the cold, the ife and the pizzle 
 I hit it up on wedge you, my schedule just won't permit it 
 I visit the gangsta town, but enough is committed 
 Might see me with another, don't go start trippin' 
 You my classic edition, one I got runnin' my kitchens 
 See it's about the pop and when it finally pop 
 Would you complain, or just shut your mouth 
 Oh yeah it's gon' pop so baby play your part 
 And get a cup of jealousy bitch 
 Prodigy: 
 My money ain't nothin', Jada you ain't fuckin' 
 See that's the fine print you need to understand, cousin 
 See I was sure he'd die for having game I 
 A tape rollin' for 50, 'cause he the boss I 
 Can't front, its gon' take some time to get used to 
 All this cash, yeah it's feelin' beautiful 
 The ladies on the key, they let a nigga live 
 Get ready for the rip session at the Sheridan 
 I got her smokin' weed, I got her drinkin' vin 
 Say, Nas yes you don't do none of that there 
 I turn your woman out, then I turn around and drop 'em off like 'good'. 
 Man we done stepped it up and we done found a home 
 For all this gangsta shit, for all this fuckin' dope 
 Man this is my dream, this is how it's supposed to be 
 Shawty climb aboard, if not (look out)
