50 Cent - Ryder Music Lyrics 
 Yeah 
 Yeah we can ride to this 
 Just lay back, crew 
 Here's a taste of my life, its bitter and sweet 
 I put my heart out to the sounds of the drums and the beat 
 I put my life on the line when I'm out on the street 
 Put my teflon on and roll with my heat 
 I keep my circle nice and small, I don't fuck with these clown niggas 
 In a race for the cheese, I run laps around niggas 
 Soon as I step on stage, the crowd applauds 
 Soon as my sneaker wear in stores, Reebok stocks sore 
 I ain't gotta say I'm a boss, niggas can tell 
 The east coast crib, the size of a small hotel 
 The shit journalist write about me, get me confused 
 Have me feelin' like the heavy weight champ when he lose 
 I read somewhere, I'm homophobic shiiit 
 Go through the hood, there's mad niggas on my dick 
 Now we can get hostile or we can do this smooth 
 T&T around, I can still make blow move 
 This is what you call ryder music 
 All the gangstas are ridin' to it 
 Let's roll, I can show ya how we do it 
 When we ride to that ryder music (let's go) 
 (Let's go) 
 Last year, I woke up, a good look, damn it feels good 
 On the low, I done fucked like half of Hollywood 
 Had your favorite actress from your favorite shows 
 In my favorite position, you know how it goes 
 In my Bentley bumpin' Prince shit "This is When Thugs Cry" 
 This is what it sounds like when hollow tip slugs fly 
 Homie, this is somethin' you can ride and smoke to 
 Stay on point, cause niggas will ride and smoke you 
 Jealousy's for women, but some niggas is bitch made 
 They make you wanna run across they head wit a switch blade 
 They point their finger at me, sayin' I'm bug 
 My flows crack you listen, your fuckin' brains on drugs 
 Look, ice drippin' on my neck, hands grippin' on the tec 
 Fool trippin' through the set, you can get ya ass whipped 
 Cards missin' out my deck, screws loose show respect 
 You try to come at me kid, your ass better come correct 
 This is what you call ryder music 
 All the gangstas are ridin' to it 
 Let's roll, I can show ya how we do it 
 When we ride to that ryder music (let's go) 
 (Let's go) 
 My mama gave birth to a winner, I gotta win 
 Pray to Lord, forgive me for my sins 
 Still thuggin', cruisin', rims gleamin' 
 Like the stones on my wrist 
 Zonin', guess this is how it feels to be rich 
 Homie, you hustlin' backwards if you chasin' a bitch 
 Stupid, chase the paper, they come with the shit 
 I'm fallin', in love with success 
 Entrepeneure, kinda sewer, I maneuver the best 
 Rowin', ruger on my lap, rubber grip on the handle 
 Stunt I'll have ya homies burn a rest in peace candle 
 As wise men speak, I listen and learn 
 A man dies, a baby's born, my niggas the world turns 
 Rappers, I make 'em sick when I say I'm the shit 
 They mistake my confidance for arrogance, they hate on the kid 
 In '99, I had a vision and made a decision 
 Bein' broke is against my religion, now picked up 
 This is what you call ryder music 
 All the gangstas are ridin' to it 
 Let's roll, I can show ya how we do it 
 When we ride to that ryder music (let's go) 
 (Let's go)
