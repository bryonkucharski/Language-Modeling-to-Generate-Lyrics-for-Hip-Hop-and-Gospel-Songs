(Feat. Lloyd Banks and Tony Yayo) 
 [50 Cent:] Yeah 
 (Chorus: 50 Cent) 
 This is 50 Cent, Banks and Yayo in the club 
 Runnin' around this bitch pissy drunk with the snub 
 Niggas want to get it crackin' we don't give a fuck 
 Boy you fuck around we 'gon hit yo ass up 
 This is 50 Cent, Banks and Yayo in the club 
 Runnin' around this bitch pissy drunk with the snub 
 Niggas want to get it crackin' we don't give a fuck 
 Boy you fuck around we 'gon hit yo ass up 
 (Verse 1: 50 Cent) 
 When I grip the Tec 
 Hit the deck 
 I'll spray at you're way 
 Nicknamed my chopper Scrappy that's my Kay Kay 
 Pussy get out of line and your ass can die today 
 Look at my soldiers to get 'em is all I got to say 
 Hennessy, rum and Coke a little Alize 
 Got me in the mood to bust a nigga head man 
 I ain't playin' ain't got no time for them games 
 Niggas lose they life all the time for fuckin' playin' 
 (Chorus: 50 Cent) 
 This is 50 Cent, Banks and Yayo in the club 
 Runnin' around this bitch pissy drunk with the snub 
 Niggas want to get it crackin' we don't give a fuck 
 Boy you fuck around we 'gon hit yo ass up 
 This is 50 Cent, Banks and Yayo in the club 
 Runnin' around this bitch pissy drunk with the snub 
 Niggas want to get it crackin' we don't give a fuck 
 Boy you fuck around we 'gon hit yo ass up 
 (Verse 2: Lloyd Banks) 
 Look at my chick, look at my whip look how my rims move 
 Get a real good look, but don't scheme 'cause I got my pistol 
 Platinum on wrist blue 
 Wrist poppin' bling green by the fist full 
 I'm smokin' chong good 
 Don't ride through the wrong hood 
 Unless you got a vest on 
 That Teflon 
 Like a don should 
 I'm rollin' sticky green 
 Every nigga with me clean 
 Strap got it tucked know what I mean? 
 (Chorus: 50 Cent) 
 This is 50 Cent, Banks and Yayo in the club 
 Runnin' around this bitch pissy drunk with the snub 
 Niggas want to get it crackin' we don't give a fuck 
 Boy you fuck around we 'gon hit yo ass up 
 This is 50 Cent, Banks and Yayo in the club 
 Runnin' around this bitch pissy drunk with the snub 
 Niggas want to get it crackin' we don't give a fuck 
 Boy you fuck around we 'gon hit yo ass up 
 (Verse 3: Tony Yayo) 
 It's the general homie that's commanding these advances 
 My semi-automatic ravin' 
 Stay blazin' 
 The Rover be Etchel White 
 Shorty leaned over but I'm mad 'cause she got an over-bite 
 I got your baby's mother 
 Movin' overloads of Coke 
 For Louey Vuitton minks, belts, bags and coats 
 Homie we enrich you're bitch or hood rat 
 That's why my waves spinnin' in that G Unit hat 
 (Chorus: 50 Cent) 
 This is 50 Cent, Banks and Yayo in the club 
 Runnin' around this bitch pissy drunk with the snub 
 Niggas want to get it crackin' we don't give a fuck 
 Boy you fuck around we 'gon hit yo ass up 
 This is 50 Cent, Banks and Yayo in the club 
 Runnin' around this bitch pissy drunk with the snub 
 Niggas want to get it crackin' we don't give a fuck 
 Boy you fuck around we 'gon hit yo ass up
