Ah, man 
 You know where the niggas be at right? 
 Take me to 'em 
 All through the hood, I keep hearin' niggas sayin' 
 I'm supposed to die tonight 
 Niggas come put a hit out and they talkin' like the shit okay 
 I'm down to ride tonight 
 We crawlin', whip stolen, AK loaded 
 I'm down to ride tonight 
 It's smokin', street locin', locked and loaded 
 Somebody gon' die tonight 
 This is nothin' new, I been in the position before 
 Grandma crib, niggas outside of her door 
 Different day, same shit, old mac, new clip 
 Thirty two hollow tips, gloves, no rubber grip 
 I'm a boss but niggas never show no respect 
 I catch 'em slippin', I have 'em tongue kissin' my tec 
 Wanna come test me, pussy boy don't try 
 Police responds, never fast enough, the shots fired 
 Don't be stupid, find out who you fuckin' wit son 
 'Fore we find out where ya bitch gets her hair and nails done 
 It's elementary, life is but a dream 
 You know row, row ya boat, your blood forms a stream 
 After you get hit, you shoulda thought about the shit 
 You took that paper, you take a life or ya life get took bitch 
 Sometimes, I sit and look at life from a different angle 
 Don't know if I'm God's child or I'm Satan's angel 
 All through the hood, I keep hearin' niggas sayin' 
 I'm supposed to die tonight 
 Niggas come put a hit out and they talkin' like the shit okay 
 I'm down to ride tonight 
 We crawlin', whip stolen, AK loaded 
 I'm down to ride tonight 
 It's smokin', street locin', locked and loaded 
 Somebody gon' die tonight 
 In 2002, if you asked me to make a wish 
 I simply woulda wished that my music would be a hit 
 Big said, damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper 
 And pray for my downfall, I understand it all 
 But me, I'm a little more flashy a nigga 
 So chances are, I'ma have to blast me a nigga 
 I'm on that keflon vest shit, that wild wild west shit 
 And eighty one 1 carrot stones in my necklace 
 I shine so hard, I make mothafuckas wanna kill me 
 Every projects and every hood I go, they feel me 
 Know it sounds like rap but this shit is real B 
 I don't talk that rich shit but nigga I'm filthy 
 When I come out to play, had my mom been with me 
 You could bet your bottom dollar that revolver with me 
 Homeboy, frontin' on me will shorten your life span 
 Hold the mic with my left, the knife in my right hand 
 All through the hood, I keep hearin' niggas sayin' 
 I'm supposed to die tonight 
 Niggas come put a hit out and they talkin' like the shit okay 
 I'm down to ride tonight 
 We crawlin', whip stolen, AK loaded 
 I'm down to ride tonight 
 It's smokin', street locin', locked and loaded 
 Somebody gon' die tonight
