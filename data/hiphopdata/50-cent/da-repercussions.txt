Uh huh, Uh huh, five, five, one... it's real shit nigga 
 You niggas say somethin' slick, you'll get SLAPPED for that 
 You niggas schemin' on some jewels, you'll get CLAPPED for that 
 If y'all niggas want war, I got the MACK for that 
 Run up with some work, and get your head CRACKED for that 
 Nigga if a nickel bag sold in the park, I want in on it 
 The bullshit I'm in right now nigga, I've been on it (yeah) 
 If I don't eat, nobody eat, code of the street 
 No surrender, no retreat, my niggas rollin' with heat (woo) 
 You'll know my stees, I spark trees, under palm trees 
 Feel a breeze, and fees, in expanded keys 
 Cop it straight from the bay, tap dance on the yay 
 Your people make a G day, you ain't rich, you just ok 
 I take the stand under oath and lie 
 Before I snitch on my clique, I'll fry 
 Or watch time go by 
 Niggas want to steal slabs, and dib or dab 
 In the posse, who steals from the hands that feed 'em, deserve to die 
 You gettin' money nigga (yeah), you dimed out (yeah) 
 Well 50 Cent is the hottest shit out this (yeah) 
 You bust your gun nigga (yeah), you on the run nigga (yeah) 
 You treat a grown man, like he ya son (nigga) 
 Yo, I ain't the first parolee, to catch his nigga for his rolee 
 And after being on the street, less than a week 
 Look, niggas who know me, know I'm up to no good 
 Man my fan base is spreading like HIV in the hood 
 Why smack a nigga silly, when I can squeeze the nilly (squeeze that shit) 
 A slug'll split a niggas ass, worst than the philly 
 I stay with the heater, cut the D with Bonita 
 My wifey kept acting up, so I had to leave her 
 It hurted when I left, but I knew I didn't need her 
 If it wasn't for my seed, I wouldn't even hafta see her 
 She tried to front like she don't need me, she miss me, believe me 
 It's that soap opera shit, the bitch watch too much TV 
 Aight you niggas tryin' to do too much (STOP FRONTIN') 
 Them little bit of chips you got son, (AIN"T NOTHIN') 
 I seen you with your whip outside (YOU STUNTIN') 
 You spent your last on that (YOU AIN'T HOLDIN' NOTHIN') 
 Rap niggas, they actin' like they ready to flip 
 When I let off a clip, it ain't a part of the script 
 It's like tradition, rap niggas, dyin' they whips 
 So I spent a little chips, to bulletproof my shit 
 You a 6 coupe nigga, but you gears behind 
 Nigga yours a 92, mine's a 99 
 Your not in my league, the ghetto taught me tools to succeed 
 Shallow up a seed, I'll write it down so you can read 
 If you've been listening, I know you've been loving what I said 
 If not you dumb fuck, I just run over your head
