(50 Cent) 
 I can hear your heartbeat, you're scared, yeah yeah 
 I can hear your heartbeat, you're scared [x2] 
 You see, I'm a psycho, a sicko, I'm crazy 
 I see, I got my knife boy, I kill you, you make me 
 They wanna see me shot up, locked up and cage me 
 I'll come back bigger, stronger and angry 
 (50 Cent) 
 Look look, I come from a different crew, you fuck with me, I'll get to you 
 A clip or two'll cripple you, just 'cause I ain't got shit to do 
 Pistol pop, a pussy drop, drama never ever stop 
 Eenie meenie miney moe, now tre pound or 44 
 Pick a strap to take the mag. The hawk I'll stab it in your back 
 I'll blow your brains, I know your name 
 And where you rest, I'll make a mess 
 The holla tips'll hit ya chest, you cough up blood to EMS 
 Come pick you up, You know you fucked 
 When you get on a stretcher 
 'Cause I'll come in ta ICU, to see you off to heaven 
 The system I done been through. If there's nothing you did to me 
 They locked me up they let me out, you seen this in the movies 
 The criminals be criminals, why they up in corrections? 
 They come on get a 9, nigga me grind to perfection 
 It's murder when they found the gun now they doing ballistics 
 But they can't find a fingerprint this shit's going terrific 
 He's so close to your target that it's really hard to miss it 
 (Eminem) 
 Man these are average raps, I'm keepin' the savage batch hidden 
 The can of whoop ass with the Shady Aftermath lid 
 You pop off the top it's like opening vats of acid 
 Beat the Octamom to death with a Cabbage Patch Kid 
 Attack a snatch, yeah there's something to jack a batch in 
 Impregnate her then shoot up the embryo sack with Mac 10s 
 Triplets, quadruplets and a couple of back to back twins 
 Dead fetuses fallin' out all over, Jack is back again 
 The Rippers at your service, girl I can see that your nervous 
 But I barely scratch the surface, like my last batch of girlfriends 
 That I buried in my fuckin' backyard. Still trying to dig their way out 
 I foam like an attack dog, how late you wanna stay out 
 It's past your curfew when its dark, I'm searchin for you in the park 
 Shady murdered him another virgin he just hit his mark 
 He met his quota for the month. They found Dakota all rolled up 
 Inside a bag he probably dragged the body for about a block 
 Disappeared without a trace, no DNA, no not a drop 
 Cause me and Dre and 50 we will never get caught by the cops 
 CSI they hate us but they gotta give a lot of props 
 The drama pops, grab the butcher knife from off the counter top. 
 (Eminem) 
 I'm as ill as can be 
 My appeal is to serial killers, what a pill is to me, 
 Killing so villainously, 
 Still as maniacal on the Nyquil and psycho as Michael Myers, 
 You know what we're like on the muthafucking mic so try us 
 And you're gonna find out what the fuck we're like with pliers. 
 (50 Cent) 
 It's operation time they got 'em hooked up to wires, 
 Queezing, he bleeding, wheezing, breathing he half dead, 
 He must say no, but now he know how shady the Math is, 
 Even murderous tactics, get better with practice, 
 Lead showers, gun powder, fill the tellers burn burn, 
 Truly ours Julia, you better learn learn. 
 (Eminem) 
 Chris Reeves in his grave, yeah homie turn turn, 
 I'm debating, mutilating the lady, 
 You've been waiting for shady 
 And Fif. Ain't no duplicating it baby, 
 There's a baby in the drive, there's a torso in the washer, 
 I think it might even belong to Portia when I tossed her, 
 Arms and legs in the garbage 'cause the rest of her, I lost her, 
 Her head is in the disposal with Jessica's I squashed her, 
 And put her through the ringer and hung her over the wash tub. 
 (50 Cent) 
 When I'm through with Ricky it'll be blood that'll cough up 
 A hard rock, a soft fuck 
 Get caught up and get washed up, 
 In Detroit or Northfolk, 
 When it's disrupt and nauseas, 
 Look deep in my eyes, see Many Many Men die, 
 I swing gym stars faster than Samurai.
