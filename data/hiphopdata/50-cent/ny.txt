 Get a foam this mess on cutting this mat for em 
 Pop up in the yulla could dead for em

 I hate when you niggas do shit then make me ask why 
 If you the homie why you won't gonna testify 
 Why you wanna see a nigga get the champ fry 
 A... in New York standing at the sky 
 Why you hurt your friends more than your enemies 
 And why you don't seek the stroke to your memories 
 Why is the question I ask 
 Shit was all good when you're splitting up stacks 
 The shit you told the people gotta undermax 
 Now why would you wanna do some shit like that 
 When that barrel on your forehead don't ask why... 
 Shhh, quiet close your eyes and die! 
 Is 50 year, call me Ferrari, call me New York
