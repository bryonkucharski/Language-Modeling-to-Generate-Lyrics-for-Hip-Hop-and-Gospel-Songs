Nicole: 
 Fire! 
 (Intro: 50 Cent) 
 I make it hotter 
 Friction turns to fire 
 You're what I desire 
 I'm comin' to getcha girl 
 That's right, that's right 
 It's on tonight 
 Your just my type 
 You're what I like 
 I bring that heat 
 Ya heard me right 
 Everywhere I go, go 
 Let's go 
 (Verse 1: 50 Cent (Nicole)) 
 Somethin' new 
 It's another episode 
 Music bumpin and sweatin 
 Drippin on the dancefloor 
 I like it when shorty get it back in the bag 
 When she do it like that 
 I don't know how to act 
 Now work it 
 Go ahead grind it on me 
 That's perfect 
 I'll pay to play it 
 If its worth it 
 My phone numb' if you want me (yeah) 
 You can chirp it (yeah) 
 Baby work it (yeah) 
 (Hook: Young Buck) 
 Take these bricks and break 'em down 
 If you want I could serve them by the pound 
 Shorty don't you got what I want to flip 
 Baby girl tell me you can handle it 
 (Chorus: Nicole) 
 Well if you want it let's go 
 I got that fire 
 So hot I'll burn it down 
 I think ya already know 
 I got that fire (fire) 
 I'm the flyest chick around 
 You want it (ooh) 
 It's fire (ooh) 
 I've got it (ooh) 
 That fire (ooh) 
 So I'm might (ooh) 
 Ignite ya (ooh) 
 It's fire (ooh) 
 It's fire (ooh) 
 (Verse 2: 50 Cent) 
 I burn it down on stage I make it hot 
 Till the fire marshals come shut down the spot 
 I had the club jam packed every time I rock 
 These other niggas ain't got the style I got 
 I go back to the basics and break it all the way, all 
 The way down 
 You can hate this but face it B. I. G. and 2Pac just 
 Ain't around 
 Everywhere you go, there I go I'm 50 Cent 
 Yes the star at the bar, I'll get ya bent 
 You wanna party, let's party 
 You wanna freak, be a freak 
 You wanna creep, we can creep 
 Tell me what it's gonna be 
 So you can... 
 (Hook: Young Buck) 
 Take these bricks and break 'em down 
 If you want I could serve them by the pound 
 Shorty don't you got what I want to flip 
 Baby girl tell me you can handle it 
 (Chorus: Nicole) 
 Well if you want it let's go 
 I got that fire 
 So hot I'll burn it down 
 I think ya already know 
 I got that fire (fire) 
 I'm the flyest chick around 
 You want it (ooh) 
 It's fire (ooh) 
 I've got it (ooh) 
 That fire (ooh) 
 So I'm might (ooh)

 (Verse 3: 50 Cent (Nicole)) 
 Now all you really ready 
 I said are really ready 
 I make the temperature rise 
 Now don't be surprised 
 I had a ice on stunt and heavy 
 I got a hell of a flow 
 You should already know 
 So over 30 million records already 
 It's the third time around 
 You know how I get down 
 I'm hands down pound for pound 
 The best around 
 Now work it 
 Go ahead grind it on me 
 That's perfect 
 I'll play to play 
 If it's worth it 
 My phone numb' if you want me (yeah) 
 You can chirp it (yeah) 
 Work it (yeah) 
 (Woo)
