 Now Baby, he keeps on sayin' and he tells you you're the only one 
 But everybody knows he's out there havin' fun 
 Behind your back, and that's a fact 
 And it ain't right 
 'Cause he's a fly guy acting like a gentlemen 
 But back in the day I can still remember when 
 He'd just turn around, wouldn't looked twice at you 
 And I, just being straight with you 
 Cause He, Takes you for a fool 
 So you, should be on your guard 
 When he thinks you don't have a clue 
 And I, keep the truth be known 
 That you, and don't fall alone 
 When He, gets everything he wants 
 So girl open up your eyes and see

 Takes your car and it's your money that be fillin' it up 
 With the wad he's got, this he hit the jackpot 
 And it ain't right 
 Cause your ?? keep him sweet and that's so typical 
 He's only in it for himself and that's so cynical 
 He'd be out of site if girl, you lost it all 
 So I, feel so bad inside 
 When He's, crusin' in your ride
