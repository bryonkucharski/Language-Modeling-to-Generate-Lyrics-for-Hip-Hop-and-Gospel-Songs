Ah man 
 You know where the niggas be at right? 
 Take me to 'em! 
 (Chorus- 50 Cent) 
 All through the hood, I keep hearin' niggas sayin' 
 "I'm supposed to die tonight" 
 Niggas come put a hit out and they talkin' like the shit okay 
 "I'm down to ride tonight" 
 We Rollin', whip stolen, AK loaded 
 "I'm down to ride tonight" 
 We smokin', Straight locin', lockin, loaded 
 "Somebody gonna die tonight" 
 (Verse 1- 50 Cent) 
 This is nothin' new, I been in this position before 
 Grandma crib, niggas outside of her door 
 Different day, same shit, old mac, new clip 
 32 hollow tips, gloves, no rubber grip 
 I'm a boss, but niggas never show no respect 
 I catch 'em slippin', I have 'em tongue kissin' my tec 
 Won come test me, pussy boy don't try 
 Police responds, never fast enough, the shots fired 
 Don't be stupid, find out who you fuckin' wit son 
 'For we find out where ya b!tch gets her hair and nails done 
 Its elementary, life is but a dream 
 You know row, row ya boat, your blood forms a stream 
 After you get hit, you shoulda thought about the shit 
 You took that paper, you take a life or ya life get took b!tch 
 Sometimes, I sit and look at life from a different angle 
 Don't know if I'm God's child or I'm Satan's angel 
 (Chorus- 50 Cent) 
 All through the hood, I keep hearin' niggas sayin' 
 "I'm supposed to die tonight" 
 Niggas come put a hit out and they talkin' like the shit okay 
 "I'm down to ride tonight" 
 We Rollin', whip stolen, AK loaded 
 "I'm down to ride tonight" 
 We smokin', straight locin', locked and loaded 
 Somebody gon' die tonight 
 (Verse 2- 50 Cent) 
 In 2002, if you asked me to make a wish 
 I simply woulda wished that my music would be a hit 
 BIG said damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper 
 And pray for my downfall, I understand it all 
 But me, I'm a little more flashy a nigga 
 So chances are, I'mma have to blast me a nigga 
 I'm on that teflon vest shit, that wild wild west shit 
 And eighty one 1 carrot stones in my necklace 
 I shine so hard, I make mothafuckas wanna kill me 
 Every projects and every hood I go, they feel me 
 I Know it sounds like rap, but this shit is real B 
 I don't talk that rich shit, but nigga I'm filthy 
 When I come out to play, and ma mob ain't with me 
 You could bet your bottom dollar that revolver with me 
 Homeboy, frontin' on me will shorten your life span 
 Hold ma mic with my left, ma knife in my right hand 
 (Chorus- 50 Cent) 
 All through the hood, I keep hearin' niggas sayin' 
 "I'm supposed to die tonight" 
 Niggas come put a hit out and they talkin' like the shit okay 
 "I'm down to ride tonight" 
 We rollin', whip stolen, AK loaded 
 I'm down to ride tonight 
 We smokin', straight locin', locked and loaded 
 "Somebody gon' die tonight"
