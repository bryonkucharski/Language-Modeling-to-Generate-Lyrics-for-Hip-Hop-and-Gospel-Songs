N-Y N-Y 
 Till I, D eye 
 N-Y N-Y 
 Till I, D eye 
 I'm on its 
 Everytime I come around, me I keep my gun around 
 It's never on safety 
 I'm on it 
 Niggas know when I'm around, fuck around its goin' down 
 No ifs or maybes 
 Ring around the rosies, pockets full of OZ's 
 Niggas gettin' cake made 
 Fuck with the homies while I got it on me 
 You'll get your big brick man 
 You niggas ain't seen shit yet, one false move and I click clack 
 That ooh wop but y'all spit that, that hard white I flip that 
 That bad bitch get my dick wet, damn how hot can my shit get 
 Boy get outta line get your ass checked, got 10 mil my last check 
 Bitches stay where that cash at, diamonds on me I flash that 
 That rari' pedal I mash that, you pussy niggas I laugh at 
 That fuck shit that keep fuck niggas be doin' man I'm passed that 
 Hood nigga down there on wall street, my stock run across NASDAQ 
 Girl face on my time piece, ridin' around my Grammys 
 These broke niggas so grimy, I let em' hold the steel 
 I tell em' shoot to kill, I put south side on my back 
 I ain't talkin' bout' no tat' 
 When I'm outta town I hold it down I mean everywhere I'm at 
 I'm on its 
 Everytime I come around, me I keep my gun around 
 It's never on safety 
 I'm on it 
 Niggas know when I'm around, fuck around its goin' down 
 No ifs or maybes 
 Ring around the rosies, pockets full of OZ's 
 Niggas gettin' cake made 
 Fuck with the homies while I got it on me 
 You'll get your big brick man 
 All my niggas crazy stupid, koo koo got a loose screw 
 I might pew pew with that two two, then small bullets will mob through you 
 My bitch come from Honolulu, with that dope ball in her doo doo 
 Put it on a drain and shoot you, in the face, don't have a bluetooth on me 
 No but don't know voodoo, but I sure know how to shoot you 
 If I get caught I don't boo-hoo, I pick up the phone call BooBoo 
 He gonna bail me out in seconds, please don't let this rap shit fool you 
 I send shooters to your home, see I don't need know songs to move you 
 My gorilla goin' ooh ooh, boy your family could lose you 
 Put you in a box like new shoes, you's a bitch pull down your tu-tu 
 When it come to gettin' money all I know is we need bookoo's 
 Speakin' only in my Rida' gang, know what we gonna do to you 
 I'm on its 
 Everytime I come around, me I keep my gun around 
 It's never on safety 
 I'm on it 
 Niggas know when I'm around, fuck around its goin' down 
 No ifs or maybes 
 Ring around the rosies, pockets full of OZ's 
 Niggas gettin' cake made 
 Fuck with the homies while I got it on me 
 You'll get your big brick man
