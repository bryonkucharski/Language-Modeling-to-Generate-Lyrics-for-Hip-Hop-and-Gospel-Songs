Yo, niggas be askin' me, "Yo 50, who you got beef wit?" 
 I'm a tell y'all niggas, who I got beef wit 
 I got beef wit any nigga, I can't make no money wit 
 If I can't make no money wit you, fuck you nigga 
 G-Unit nigga, that's what's up 'cause I said, that's what's up 
 I get money, money I got 
 So it's a 100 grams or better when I'm going to cop 
 I never hold the toaster 'cause I use my little soldier 
 And my down bitch as a holster, like I'm supposed ta 
 Heavy pistol sales for living 
 My gun rip through lungs and tear through tissue 
 While I'm out for the ends, you out for a rep 
 That's the same thing that have yo mama in a black dress 
 See me in a black lex, hard-top 
 My mink drop-top, fresh out the carlot 
 I got the gift of raw pugilist speeches [unverified] 
 So I'm gon sell like the box office features 
 Niggas in the hood can't see G-Unit! 
 But deep in they heart they wanna be G-Unit! 
 'Cause we got them three B's, Benzes, burners and bitches 
 And plus we on the road to the riches 
 You can say what you want about me 
 As long as you don't get in the way of my money 
 'Cause all that talking shit to me played out 
 Nigga keep bumping your gums you get laid out 
 You can say what you want about me 
 As long as you don't get in the way of my money 
 'Cause all that talking shit to me played out 
 Nigga keep bumping your gums you get laid out 
 Lately I been going through a phase 
 Hope they ain't tap the phones 
 'Cause we got pumps the size of saxophones 
 Therefore. I'm on the move with the squad 
 I'm stingy as ever, known to trick fast food on a broad 
 Picture me putting jewels on a broad 
 I'd rather put shoes on the car 
 A pool in the yard 
 You don't really wanna fool with the God 
 Nigga my front line long enough to fill two boulevards 
 In this game, you only make it far if you loyal 
 And if you grew up with your mother and your father you spoiled 
 Why swing, you gotta be strapped to get rid of me 
 I'll leave you in water like the statute of liberty 
 Tryin' to be cool 
 Blowin' green that strong enough to make a white boy open fire on a school 
 Keep rappin' for your hood, I'm rappin' for Benzes 
 And long assault rifles with straps on the lenses 
 You can say what you want about me 
 As long as you don't get in the way of my money 
 'Cause all that talking shit to me played out 
 Nigga keep bumping your gums you get laid out 
 Y'all niggas gotta learn from me 
 (Yeah!) 
 What I learned from Gotta Rock and Spank G 
 (Un huh) 
 Y'all niggas gotta learn from me 
 (Yeah!) 
 What I learned from watching Brucie B 
 Look, "I shot the sheriff" 
 And nigga if you get too close yo punk ass getting shot 
 Here's the plan, I'm a keep stackin' my ends 
 Till I'm on airplane seats in the Maebach Benz 
 I'm all about the chips 
 I done took them trips 
 22's on the 6 
 26 on the bricks 
 And them outta town niggas, I'm chargin' y'all more 
 I Tapdance on the shit I ain't servin' it raw 
 You sell smoke, look nigga I got what you need 
 But it ain't goin' cheap I got mouths to feed 
 Niggas always sayin' damn 50 you bugged 
 'Cause I got hoes giving niggas the date rape drug 
 Gimme his watch and his chain 
 We not the same, he a lame 
 He want pussy, I'm 'bout my money man 
 Crap table in Vegas had his bitch on my dick 
 Threw a 7 so many times they thought the dice was fixed 
 Yo it's 50 when your mind frame change and start to rearrange 
 I'll see you another day motherfucker it's 50 
 Shots till your heart drop and freeze up, ease up motherfucker 
 You can say what you want about me 
 As long as you don't get in the way of my money 
 'Cause all that talking shit to me played out 
 Nigga keep bumping your gums you get laid out
