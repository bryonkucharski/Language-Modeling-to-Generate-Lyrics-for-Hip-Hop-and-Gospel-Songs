 Tell --, "Get they money right," 'cause I got mine 
 And I'm around quit playin' -- you can't shine 
 You gon be that next chump to end up in the trunk 
 After bein hit by the --, is that what you want? 
 Be easy --, I'll lay your -- out 
 Believe me --, that's what I'm about, gangsta 
 You could find a -- sittin' on chrome 
 Hit the clutch, hit the gear, hit the gas and I'm gone (Yeah!) 
 If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done

 'Cause you'll get hit and homicide'll be askin, "What happened?" 
 (On no), look who clapped 'em with the -- 
 20 inch rims sittin' on (low pro's)

 In the game there's up's and down's, so I stay on the grind 
 -- On my -- more than my --, I stay on they mind 
 They ain't nothin' they could do to stop my shine 
 This is God's plan homey, this ain't mine 
 I played the music loud so Grandpa called me a nuisance 
 And Grandma; who always gotta throw a 100 percent 
 I'm the drop out who made more more money than these teachers 
 Ruthless like the Coupe but I come with more features 
 I am what I am, you could like it or love it 
 It feels good to pull 50 grand and think nothin' of it 
 If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done
