Oh, don't even look at me wrong 
 When I come through the hood 
 Ain't nuttin' change, still holla at my homies 
 Oh, and when I hit the block, I still will kill 
 And I don't want to, nigga but I will if I got to 
 Kill if niggaz get to fucking around 
 If niggaz get to fucking around 
 Yeah, respect come from admiration and fear 
 You can admire me if you could catch one in your wig 
 You see the Testarosa, the toaster's right on my lap 
 So if a nigga get out of line and nigga get clapped 
 I got a arsenal, an infantry, I'm built for this mentally 
 That's why I'm the general, I do what they pretend to do 
 Front on me now nigga, I'll be the end of you 
 Forget your enemies and think of what your friends'll do 
 I drop a bag off, they'll let a mag off 
 The Heckler and Koch'll tear half of your ass off 
 I'm not for the games, I'm not for all the playing 
 The hollow tips rain when I unleash the pain 
 Get the message from the lines or get the message from the 9 
 Paint a picture with words, you can see when I shine 
 Put my back on the wall, nigga watch me go for mine 
 I let 21 shots off at the same time, yeah 
 Oh, don't even look at me wrong 
 When I come through the hood 
 Ain't nuttin' change, still holla at my homies 
 Oh, and when I hit the block I still will kill 
 And I don't want to, nigga but I will if I got to 
 Kill if niggaz get to fucking around 
 If niggaz get to fucking around 
 Yeah, where I'm from death is always in the air homie 
 Nana love me so you know she say my prayers for me 
 I come creepin' through the hood wearin' Teflon 
 Hit the corners motherfuckers get left on 
 Niggaz know if not, they better check my background 
 Try and stick me, I'll fill your back with mac rounds 
 Ask Prim' nigga 50 don't back down 
 I kick it funky like fiends in the crack house 
 Cross the line boy, I'ma air ya ass out 
 Screw your face at me, I wanna know what that's 'bout 
 Nigga I know you ain't mad, I done came up 
 And if you are, fuck you 'cause I ain't change up 
 The O.G.'s wanna talk but I don't know these niggaz 
 And I ain't did no business with 'em, I don't owe these niggaz 
 A minute of my time, I get it 'cause I grind 
 All across the globe like the world's mine, yeah 
 Oh, don't even look at me wrong 
 When I come through the hood 
 Ain't nuttin' change, still holla at my homies 
 Oh, and when I hit the block I still will kill 
 And I don't want to, nigga but I will if I got to 
 Kill if niggaz get to fucking around 
 If niggaz get to fucking around 
 Convict, now tell me, have you ever looked off in the distance? 
 And seen the mac aimin' at your head Mayne 
 (Head Mayne) 
 Before you know it life is flashin' reminiscin' 
 And your body is drippin' and full of lead Mayne 
 (Lead Mayne) 
 I done been there 
 I done copped that 
 It ain't never been a question, I'm bout that 
 Don't go there 
 You get clapped at 
 And if you plan to fuck around and re-route that 
 You'll never catch me ridin' around on these streets 
 Without a couple metal pieces under my feet 
 Fully automatic weapons unloaded will unleash 
 Stash up under the carpet like a can of sea breeze 
 50 don't make me ride on these niggaz 
 (Ay) 
 'Cause I will kill, dip and hide on these niggaz 
 50 don't make me ride on these niggaz 
 (Ay) 
 'Cause I be long gone like the ripper so 
 Oh, don't even look at me wrong 
 When I come through the hood 
 Ain't nuttin' change, still holla at my homies 
 Oh, and when I hit the block I still will kill 
 And I don't want to, nigga but I will if I got to 
 Kill if niggaz get to fucking around 
 If niggaz get to fucking around
