Somebody pull the fire alarm, girl, where you from? 
 'Cause you got this club on fire and outside I bet all they smell is smoke 
 (All they smell is smoke) 
 The way your body roll I'ma lose control 
 'Cause you got this club on fire and outside I bet all they smell is smoke 
 (All they smell is smoke) 
 Pink diamonds, pink sand, beaches Aruba 
 Blue sapphires on days when she feeling Hoover 
 She hood and in the mood when I'm in the mood 
 Erotic, so exotic, I'm psychotic about it 
 I don't want forever, I just wanna taste her love sample 
 That product, I bet a nigga tongue go numb 
 She's a narcotic, that bomb shit burning, we smoking 
 My old flame, my Mary Jane, we got a love thing 
 She ain't jealous, I keep Nina around 
 In the small of my back in case some shit go down 
 Right under my Hermes, I'm hearing the word is 
 Me, I'm a P.I.M.P 
 I let Trey hit some, then Dre hit some 
 Then pass it to the homies 'til we all get done 
 Niggas can't comprehend what this shit 'bout 
 Police coming, you like, put this shit out 
 You like smoke and you got me high 
 (You make a nigga want to get down) 
 High 
 (High feeling like I'm up in a cloud) 
 Girl what the fuck you done to me 
 You got me feeling like you just rolled up for me 
 You're like smoke 
 And you got me high 
 (So high make your love come down) 
 High 
 (One time, have that ass turnt out) 
 Girl what the fuck you done to me 
 You got me feeling like you just rolled up for me 
 You're like smoke 
 Shawty hot, she full blown, she hot now 
 100 degrees, that's with or without the top down 
 But when she get to working her hips you know the temperature rise 
 Oh lord, soon as she see the dick in her thighs 
 She like the stones in my cross, she flawless 
 I'm thinking damn, why would God give one woman all this? 
 You know I got the kind of conversation that make her feel like she need me 
 It's complicated, my occupation pimping ain't easy 
 Facts, I stack racks on racks and racks 
 Back when I was pumping crack, now my cards are black 
 Nigga get on my level, bark with the big dogs 
 If I want it I buy it, I don't care what this shit costs 
 Luther said it: A house is not a home without her 
 I had them panties on the grey hound filled up with powder 
 But what she showed what she'll do for me has no limits 
 Her wanting is temporary like some smoke gon' get it 
 You like smoke and you got me high 
 (You make a nigga want to get down) 
 High 
 (High feeling like I'm up in a cloud) 
 Girl what the fuck you done to me 
 You got me feeling like you just rolled up for me

 Girl what the fuck you done to me 
 You got me feeling like you just rolled up for me

 Everybody showing the love when she at the door 
 Turn this bitch down, that's fire in the hole 
 I'm trying to get it and hit it, I don't wanna pass that 
 Got me addicted, I'm tripping, where the stash at? 
 Baby, baby, don't you know? 
 Baby, baby, you're just like smoke
