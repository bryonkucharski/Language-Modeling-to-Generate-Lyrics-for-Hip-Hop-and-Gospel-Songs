Like the fire needs the air 
 I won't burn unless you're there 
 Yeah, I need you, I need you to hate 
 So I can use you for your energy 
 You know, it's real shit, feel this 
 America's got a thing for this gangsta's shit, they love me 
 Black chucks, black skullies, leather pelle-pelle 
 I take spills over raymo shit, I'ma fan 
 Got that silver duck tape on my Trey Eight handle 
 The women on my life bring confusion, shit 
 So like Nino from New Jack, I'll have to cancel that 
 Bitch, look at me, this is the life I chose 
 Niggaz around me so cold, man my heart dun froze up 
 I build an empire on the low, the narcs don't know 
 I'm the weatherman, I take that coco leaf and make that snow 
 Sit back, watch it turn to dope, watch it go out the door 
 O after O, you know, homey, I'm just triple beam, dreamin' 
 Niggaz be schemin', I'm fiendin' to live a good life 
 The fiends just fiendin' 
 Conceal my weapon nice and easy so you can't see 
 The penitentiary is definitely out the question for me 
 I want the finer things in my life 
 So I hustle 
 (Hustle) 
 Nigga you get in my way when while I'm tryin' to get mine 
 And I'll buck you 
 (Buck you) 
 I don't care who you run with or where you from 
 Nigga fuck you 
 (Fuck you) 
 I want to find the thing that's in my life 
 So I hustle 
 (Hustle) 
 Yeah, I don't know shit about gymnastics, I summersault bricks 
 Black talents start flyin', when a nigga flip 
 I cook, crack in the microwave, niggaz can't fuck with me 
 Man my cold days, they called me chef boy are fifty 
 Check my logic, smokers don't like seeds in their weed shit 
 Send me them seeds I'll grow 'em what they need 
 Them ain't chia pet plants in the crib that's chronic 
 And I'm sellin' them five hundred a pop, God damn it 
 I sold everythin', I'ma hustler, I know how to grind 
 Step on grapes put in water and tell you its wine 
 If you analyze me, what you'll find is the DNA of a crook 
 What goes in my mind, it's contagious 
 Hypnotic, it sounds melodic 
 If the rap was the block or spider, I'll be that potent product 
 Now get a load of me, flashy, far from low key 
 And you can locate me where ever that dope be, gettin' money man 
 I want the finer things in my life 
 So I hustle 
 (Hustle) 
 Nigga you get in my way when while I'm tryin' to get mine 
 And I'll buck you 
 (Buck you) 
 I don't care who you run with or where you from 
 Nigga fuck you 
 (Fuck you) 
 I want to find the thing that's in my life 
 So I hustle 
 (Hustle) 
 It's a hustler's ambition, close your eyes listen, see my vision 
 Mossberg pumpin', shotgun dumpin' and drama means nothin' 
 It's part of the game, catch me in the coupe switchin lanes 
 In the jewels with your chains 
 I upgrade from 30 BS to clean VS 
 Rocks that I copped procedes from the spot 
 I got the energy to win, I'm full of adrenaline 
 Played it perf and get nauseous, watchin' the spinner spin 
 I make plans to make it, a prisoner of the state 
 Now I can invite yo ass out to my estate 
 Them hollow tips bent me up, but I'm back in shape 
 Pour crystal in the blender and make a protein shake 
 I'm like the East coast number one playboy B 
 Hugh Hefner will tell you, he don't got shit on me 
 The feds watch me, icey they can't stop me 
 Racist, pointin' at me look at the nigga ratchi, hello 
 I want the finer things in my life 
 So I hustle 
 (Hustle) 
 Nigga you get in my way when while I'm tryin' to get mine 
 And I'll buck you 
 (Buck you) 
 I don't care who you run with or where you from 
 Nigga fuck you 
 (Fuck you) 
 I want to find the thing that's in my life 
 So I hustle 
 (Hustle)
