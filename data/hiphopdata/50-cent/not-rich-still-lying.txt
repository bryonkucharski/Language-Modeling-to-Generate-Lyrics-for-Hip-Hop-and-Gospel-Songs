(50 Cent talking) 
 Is this mic on, lady's and gently men 
 I like to thank you all for coming out tonight 
 For the screening of my new film 
 I'm Not Rich, and Still Lying 
 Its 50 cent starring as Game 
 Sort of biographic, I hope you enjoy yourself 
 (Verse 1 - 50 Cent) 
 50 calling me crazy, I may be just maybe 
 I'm gangster, I'm kreping, I'm move to I'm dripping 
 F*** 50, f*** Dre, f*** NWA 
 Man I'm hurricane Game (EM this n**** changed) 
 I brought the west back, I write the best raps 
 (But what about Snoop), Snoop s*** ain't all that 
 Man I get bad b****es, now I even f*** Mya 
 (I f***ed the first Game), 50 you a liar 
 See that's why I hate you, you think you know me 
 I'm tell everybody, you shot my homie 
 I hope the police get you and you go to jail 
 The Feds freeze you accounts, and you can't make bail 
 I hope everybody on G-Unit goes to hell 
 With Eminem, Obie, Stack-qo, and D12 
 So what I was a ? guard, so what I was a stripper 
 So what I never banged, I from Compton n**** 
 Now horror films, they scare me 
 I watch action films vary rarely 
 When its comedy or its drama 
 Its starring me, no problem 
 (Verse 2 - 50 Cent) 
 GG-Unot, I got my own shoe (game that s*** ain't go sale) 
 So the ads in the magazine, nobody can't tell 
 (Good luck with your next album man, I hope it does well) 
 You trying to be funny, D-Mack got all my money 
 And Jimmy robbing me, they listen probably 
 Me and face had a fall out, he really not my brother 
 We got the same father, but we got different mothers 
 Now Suge punk Dre, but he don't punk me 
 I'm on the Vibe Awards this year, nobody punch me 
 (Game you know I write that hook, for hate it or love it) 
 So what, it still on my trophy case I think noting of it 
 (50 cent talking) 
 Ha, ha, ha, this is too much fun man 
 Ay, ay n**** I seen your little DVD n**** 
 Ha, ha, ha, it that all you got 
 I mean, I mean news flash, nobody believes you 
 Ha, ha, ha, did it you say you wake up out the coma 2001 
 Well your brothers says, you were never in a coma 
 Did it you say, you were in a gang 
 Well your brothers says, you were never in a gang 
 Now you can get your records together 
 And you can submit, to me 
 I mean you can send the records you have 
 To me so I can open your album budget 
 Your recording budget, you got to send the music to the boss 
 Ha, ha, ha, ha, that's me the boss 
 Yeah its G-Unit, G-Unit 
 That it that song, I rule with a iron fist
