 (Verse 1: 50 Cent) 
 Big money, big things 
 Big wrist watch, big diamond rings 
 My niggas love when the club be off the chain 
 Y'all front they'll make you niggas take of them chains 
 You can run till the hollow tips hit ya frame 
 Hang on for ya life manye 
 A little candy paint, a little bit of chrome 
 Some woodgrain a nigga money long 
 Call shots in this bitch like a boss should 
 What the fuck I want in your hood? 
 I cruise through ya strip ridin' real slow 
 I'm not shootin' but I can and I will though 
 Said I cruise through ya strip ridin' real slow 
 I'm not shootin' but I can and I will though 
 (Chorus: 50 Cent)

 (Verse 2: Young Buck) 
 Keep my name out ya mouth 
 Before them AK shells come straight in ya house 
 Won't stop till ya whole block layin' hit 'em all up buck buck then we out 
 Fuck where you from nigga fuck what you 'bout 
 We can get it poppin' 
 Bodies start droppin' 
 Feds start watchin' 
 Niggas start talkin' 
 Death is knockin' 
 At your front door 
 Niggas really don't want war 
 Talkin' and walkin' 
 You'll meet your coffin 
 Ain't no stoppin' 
 When the Glock get to poppin' 
 Bitch niggas runnin', screamin' and hollerin' 
 Want to see what it's like when you get shot? 
 Want to get jacked for ya iced out watch? 
 My tour bus filled up with guns I ain't tryin' to go out like Big and Pac 
 (Chorus: 50 Cent) 
 Bitch what you know about?.. 
 Grippin' fo' fo's

 (Verse 3: Spider Loc) 
 Check ya ho 
 Check ya dough 
 Hate the game, but respect it though 
 Cock and blow 
 Let that go 
 Otherwise the Tec will blow 
 In other words ya neck will know 
 What it feels to have a exit hole 
 Them guns will make a nigga dumb turn him into a vegetable 
 I ruined mines 
 Doin' lines 
 My little niggas usin' nines 
 Spittin' rhymes 
 But I flip a bird 
 Feelin' like I'm losin' time 
 Got to get it all 
 I'm with it all 
 Been there, done, and did it all 
 And what I saw was niggas fall 
 Once the young whore get the call 
 (Chorus: 50 Cent) 
 Bitch what you know about?.. 
 Grippin' fo' fo's 
 Poppin' fo' fos 
 Pimpin' them hos 
 Nigga what you know about?.. 
 Gettin' that dough 
 Pushin' that blow 
 Sippin' that Mo 
 Bitch what you know about?.. 
 Bitch what you know about?.. 
 Grippin' fo' fo's 
 Poppin' fo' fos 
 Pimpin' them hos 
 Nigga what you know about?.. 
 Gettin' that dough 
 Pushin' that blow 
 Sippin' that Mo 
 Bitch what you know about?..
