From now on, everybody gon' listen to me, okay? 
 So I don't care what the fuck I say 
 If I say somethin' crazy, it's okay 
 Nigga, you better follow what I'm sayin' 
 Fuck, nigga, I don't give a fuck 
 Nigga, if I say I wanna sing New Edition 
 We all gon' sing New Edition 
 Yeah, it's 50, it's the Unit 
 [Incomprehensible] your man is on MySpace 
 That's why your pretty ass is at my place 
 A million dollar mansion in solace 
 Come in your mouth, yeah and on your face 
 I can't believe she didn't see me comin' on her 
 Zip my zipper and I went up in a Rover 
 Had another bitch rollin' up the dojah 
 Yeah, I'm gettin' head in the drop tonight 
 So tell me what I gotta do to 
 Get to fuck her in the future 
 I come through on the right, we ready to ride 
 And I'ma come to hit you tonight 
 And it's cool if you don't want to 
 But bitch, you a fool if you don't want to 
 'Cause I guarantee the action would see 
 You feelin' how it's supposed to be 
 Girl, gimme yo number 
 Forget it, I don't need your number 
 Bitch, climb up in the Hummer 
 'Cause you're gonna get fucked tonight 
 Girl, gimme yo number 
 Forget it, I don't need your number 
 Bitch, climb up in the Hummer 
 'Cause you're gonna get fucked tonight 
 Baby, you say I can't get no pussy 
 You could hit the highway, right away, it's okay 
 And if you say I can't have no pussy 
 I put you out on the highway, right away, it's okay 
 So tell me what I gotta do to 
 Get to fuck her in the future 
 Come in a new Coupe you like, be ready to ride 
 And I'ma pick you up on time 
 And it's cool if you don't want to 
 But bitch, you a fool if you don't want to 
 'Cause I guarantee that [Incomprehensible] 
 Will have you feelin' how it's supposed to be 
 Girl, gimme yo number 
 Forget it, I don't need your number 
 Bitch, climb up in the Hummer 
 'Cause you're gonna get fucked tonight 
 Girl, gimme yo number 
 Forget it, I don't need your number 
 Bitch, climb up in the Hummer 
 'Cause you're gonna get fucked tonight

 Didn't I yell use protection? You got HIV, you dirty nigga 
 You all right, I was ready for this shit, man 
 I swear to God, man, I don't think you gotta try, man

 See Yayo, that's all we gotta do 
 As soon as they say somethin' about us singin' 
 We start shootin' again
