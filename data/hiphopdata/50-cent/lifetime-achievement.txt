 50 Cent: 
 Yeah... I like da thank everybody, 
 Da haterz, ma fans... (wow), 
 It's been five years man,

 Ah-real ah really never thought I would be here, 
 First 'n' foremost I'd like da thank god... 
 For making me special! 
 You know niggas wanna kill me I stay in drama 
 Ah say uh prayer for me homie-naa pray for obama 
 Ain't nothin' change dem rednecks got dem 44 magz

 Black man 'n' da office you know dey gon flip 
 Like anna mae hand me my rifle start da go da shit, 
 But bill o'riely call me uh pinhead 4 sayin' dat shit, 
 Well him 'n' oprah winfrey both can suck on sum dick, 
 Dey said I sniff coke 'n' co-cohay shit 
 Man I don't get high 
 Dey said I slept with tracy edmonds dat was uh cool lie, 
 And da steroids musta made ma money longer 
 Ma revocal stronger

 Ah guess das life wen niggaz jus haten 
 Came along way from slingin dope 'n' da hard white
