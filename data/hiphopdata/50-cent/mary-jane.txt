De-stress 
 You might as well enjoy the drink 
 There's too much rolling over in the world 
 2 PM, breakfast in bed 
 Had a long night, I was in Vegas 
 At the Bellagio 
 I had a sweet thing from a bar in place 
 All in my brain, you're giving me a fever 
 Put it in, blew it out, body so illegal 
 She was so phenomenal 
 Get me, you're beautiful 
 You pull ups and say 
 I only met er once, a little marijuana 
 Money real good but money bringing me more problems 
 Go and do things, be my Mary Jane 
 Made a touch in your light, I take it away 
 Go with your little bit shorts, celebrate the moment 
 Roll you up, light you up 
 Show you how I own it 
 My Mary, my Mary, my Mary Jane 
 My my my my Mary Jane 
 So sexy standing in the mirror 
 Come a little closer, girl I wanna tell ya 
 Clothes off your body baby 
 I wanna get high off your love tonight 
 I want to play the naughty, can you play the last night? 
 Do it over naughty, be that T and thug life 
 Just let it rotate 
 To my lead, everywhere I come so 
 I only met er once, a little marijuana 
 Money real good but money bringing me more problems 
 Go and do things, be my Mary Jane 
 Take my mind off the stress and the strain 
 Go with your little bit shorts, celebrate the moment 
 Roll you up, light you up 
 Show you how I own it 
 My Mary, my Mary, my Mary Jane 
 My my my my Mary Jane 
 I light it up and let it out slow 
 I'm gon measure up 
 Nothing beats this feeling I know 
 Except the greatest love 
 One for now and one for the road 
 Till I come touch er up 
 When this gonna end I don't know 
 But now I'm in love with my slow 
 I only met er once, a little marijuana 
 Money real good but money bringing me more problems 
 Go and do things, be my Mary Jane 
 Take my mind off the stress and the strain 
 Go with your little bit shorts, celebrate the moment 
 Roll you up, light you up 
 Show you how I own it 
 My Mary, my Mary, my Mary Jane 
 My my my my Mary Jane 
 Light it up, pass it around 
 Burn it up baby, then blow it up
