Here's a little info you should know 
 You don't know what you're in for 
 Get the party rockin', bottles poppin' 
 Tonight we gon' turn up till we twisted, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 System thumpin', the club is jumpin' 
 Tonight we gon' turn up till we twisted, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Let's toast to success and take it a little higher 
 May tomorrow bring you everything your heart desires 
 Let your driving ambition offer you new visions 
 May your gut-instinct help you make good decisions 
 This is more than Champagne, this is more than just a glass 
 This is a symbol of accomplishment we rarely ever had 
 Let's enjoy tonight like tonight's our last 
 We can focus on the future and reflect on the past 
 We done came so far, I mean, look where we are 
 If they don't call us by name they call us entrepreneurs 
 From the block to the board room, the hood to the high life 
 Skyscraper paper, baby, life in the limelight 
 Want the best of the best, the top of the top 
 I mean the baddest bitch, you know, the cream of the crop 
 We gotta hustle and have it, we better than average 
 More like the elite, my nigga, we gotta eat 
 Get the party rockin', bottles poppin' 
 Tonight we gon' turn up till we twisted, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 System thumpin', the club is jumpin' 
 Tonight we gon' turn up till we twisted, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 What was once a strike against us has become an advantage 
 'Cause we grind when we at it like we stone-cold addicts 
 That mastermind, the mental is oh so essential 
 Product of the environment, they ain't been what we've been through 
 I'm fond of the phrase "If there's a will, there's a way" 
 'Cause we come from the parts where only killas could play 
 Southside, it's all right, ghetto's my Alma Mater huh? It's all right 
 We could keep the party jumpin' like this all night 
 The bottles, just keep 'em coming, baby, let's get right 
 Let's get it on, play a little Marvin 
 It's gettin' hot in here, homie, this could be a problem 
 Keni Burke style, let's keep rising to the top 
 Let's do it, do it big and let the fuckin' haters watch, oh yeah 
 This is perfect, this a moment to remember 
 As we proceed on our money getting agenda 
 Get the party rockin', bottles poppin' 
 Tonight we gon' turn up till we twisted, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 System thumpin', the club is jumpin' 
 Tonight we gon' turn up till we twisted, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah
