 Oh Yes! 
 (50 Cent) 
 I wanna be the reason you smile after you wipe your tears, 
 The reason you have the courage to confront your fears, 
 The reason there's two carrots in each of your ears, 
 I spurge with the paper ma, I don't care, 
 How ya like the pumps, boots, jeeps, and coops 
 Make celebrities, 50 fall off never, 
 What's, mine is yours and what's yours is mine, 
 So when I shine, you shine. 
 C'mon the finest Champaign we can toast to life, 
 Crab table in Vegas you can toss the dice, 
 Don't let your friends get ya confused, said 50 bad news, 
 I need ya in my life girl your too much to lose. 
 (J. Lo) 
 It's funny cause, for a while, 
 I walked around with a smile but, 
 Deep inside, I could hear, voices telling me this ain't right. 
 Don't you know, it's not for you, 
 I always knew what I had to do. 
 But it's hard, to get away, 
 Because I love you I just tried to stay. 
 I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it, 
 After telling everybody that I wasn't with it, 
 Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it 
 And I know inside I'ma be all right. 
 I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it, 
 After telling everybody that I wasn't with it, 
 Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it 
 And that voice inside says I'm gonna be all right. 
 (J. Lo) 
 Friends of mine, say to me, 
 They say you got control over me. 
 You're not alone, I played my part, 
 I saw the way you were from the start. 
 Could I expect, so much from you, 
 You had a girl when I first met you. 
 Did the best that you could do 
 Now I realize I can't change you 
 I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it, 
 After telling everybody that I wasn't with it, 
 Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it 
 And I know inside I'ma be all right. 
 I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it, 
 After telling everybody that I wasn't with it, 
 Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it 
 And that voice inside says I'm gonna be all right. 
 (J. Lo) 
 Said I wouldn't walk away, 
 Some days I want to stay, 
 But leaving you is what I need to do to be okay. 
 Never thought it would be true, 
 Me livin' without you, 
 But now it's time for me to make that move.

 Now when I tell ya what my wishes are you don't respect it, 
 When I smile at ya you don't smile back to reconnect it. 
 You ain't been gone long but, I already miss you, 
 I need you next to me so I can hug you and kiss you. 
 All the talkin' on the phone, all the time we share, 
 How could you fix your mouth to say, "I don't care" 
 I had plans for us, to buy ice together, 
 Engagement rings, and things and share life together, 
 Now when your friends tell ya 50 called, you're like whatever. 
 Do you think we were wrong for each other from the start, 
 Or was it my actions that made us fall apart. 
 Just want you to know you'll always have a place in my heart. 
 I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it, 
 After telling everybody that I wasn't with it, 
 Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it 
 And I know inside I'ma be all right. 
 I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it, 
 After telling everybody that I wasn't with it, 
 Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it 
 And that voice inside says I'm gonna be all right. 
 Oh no, be all right 
 Oh no, says I'm gonna be all right 
 I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it, 
 After telling everybody that I wasn't with it, 
 Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it 
 And I know inside I'ma be all right. 
 I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it, 
 After telling everybody that I wasn't with it, 
 Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it 
 And that voice inside says I'm gonna be all right.
