I gotta makeit to heaven, for going through hell 
 Gotta make it to heaven, gotta make it to heaven 
 I gotta make it to heaven, for going through hell 
 Gotta make it to heaven I hope I make it to heaven

 Some say I'm paranoid I say I'm careful how I choose my friends 
 Been to ICU once I ain't going again 
 First Zee got murked, then Roy got murked 
 An homies still in the hood, why he ain't getting hurt 
 I smell somethin' fishy man it might be a rat 
 Damn niggaz switchin sides on niggaz just like that 
 U know me, I stay wit a bitch on her knees 
 An give guns away in the hood like government cheese 
 Spray on Suzuki's eleven hundred cc's 
 More plate on the back, straight squeezing a Mak 
 In the hood they identify niggaz by they cars 
 So I switch up whips to stay off the radar 
 I ain't gotta be around to make shit hot 
 I send Yayo to dump 30 shots on ya block 
 'Cause he'll spray dat Tec nigga if I say get it done 
 An make it wet niggaz if you round me son 
 I gotta make it to heaven, for going through hell 
 Gotta make it to heaven, gotta make it to heaven 
 I gotta make it to heaven, for going through hell 
 I gotta make it to heaven I hope I make it to heaven 
 I gotta make it to heaven, for goin' through hell 
 Gotta make it to heaven, gotta make it to heaven 
 I gotta make it to heaven, for going through hell 
 I gotta make it to heaven I hope I make it to heaven

 When I come through the hood, I don't stop to rap to niggaz 
 Get close enough to smack, get it clappin nigga 
 Pop tried to front so I waved the chrome at his ass 
 Point blank range I spazzed blew a bone out his ass 
 Two weeks later niggaz came through with Maks to lay me down 
 They sprayed I played Dead and got the fuck off the ground 
 Out the blue I get a phone call "50 waddup" 
 U send a bitch to me I send the bitch back cut up 
 I don't play that pussy shit, I done told you boy 
 Front on me, you gon meet one of my soldiers boy 
 Cousin twig shot up his mamma crib, now he in Jail 
 Trippin' off Fliks of blue cantrell, pussy and black tail 
 Pop mamma moved, but she don't talk to him no more 
 The shells from twig 4-4, blew the hinge off her do' 
 Without that check every month how she gon pay for the crib 
 Man social service finis' come an take dem kids 
 I gotta make it to heaven, for going through hell 
 Gotta make it to heaven, gotta make it to heaven 
 I gotta make it to heaven, for going through hell 
 I gotta make it to heaven I hope I make it to heaven 
 I gotta make it to heaven, for going through hell 
 Gotta make it to heaven, gotta make it to heaven 
 I gotta make it to heaven, for goin' through hell 
 I gotta make it to heaven I hope I make it to heaven

 God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change the courage 
 The change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference 
 The A80'll make you say that 
 That's the prayer they burn in ya head when you in K-SAC 
 Man I might talk to you while we up in the pens 
 But when we come home, dat don't mean we gon fuckin' be friends 
 Shells pass ya head close enough to hear 'em whistling 
 Thank god they missed you, an go grab ya pistol 
 In the hood niggaz runnin' round actin' crazy 
 Buyin little air Jordan's for maybe babies 
 See it might be his, an it might be yours 
 Cause them broads in the projects is straight up whores 
 Man it don't take much for you to get in them draws 
 You ain't can have 'em on they back or on all fours 
 You got to tell me, you feelin' this shit 
 Because I hear what I'm sayin' I know I'm killin' this shit 
 I gotta make it to heaven, for goin' through hell 
 Gotta make it to heaven, gotta make it to heaven 
 I gotta make it to heaven, for goin' through hell 
 I gotta make it to heaven I hope I make it to heaven 
 I gotta make it to heaven, for going through hell 
 Gotta make it to heaven, gotta make it to heaven 
 I gotta make it to heaven, for going through hell 
 I gotta make it to heaven I hope I make it to heaven
