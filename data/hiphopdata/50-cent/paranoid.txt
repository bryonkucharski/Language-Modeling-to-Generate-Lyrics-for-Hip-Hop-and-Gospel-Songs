The fuck son 
 I'm tellin' you, man 
 You gotta watch these niggaz, man 
 I'm paranoid, bitch, I can't sleep 
 Niggaz tryin' to get me, man, gimme my heat 
 Put one under my pillow, one under my seat 
 Niggaz lookin' at me like I'm somethin' to eat 
 We thought the coke and the dope'll help us escape poverty 
 When that didn't work we resorted to armed robbery 
 Yeah, I done it but I ain't the one they say did it 
 Before my first verse my Benz had been kitted 
 I'm so hood, that's what the bitches like about me 
 She bob and weave she up 
 And down she suck the life up out me 
 I tell you about my regimen I'm blowin' stacks stuntin' 
 The coldest shit I'm on it kid I blow a nigga frontin' 
 I'm dirty, yeah, I do that dirt I'm down 
 To put that work in 
 I kick that door to get them bricks 
 That eagle get to chirpin' 
 See the beam and your hit, nigga leakin' 
 Yeah, screamin' and shit, man, shut the fuck up 
 I'm paranoid, bitch, I can't sleep 
 Niggaz tryin' to get me, man, gimme my heat 
 Put one under my pillow, one under my seat 
 Niggaz lookin' at me like I'm somethin' to eat 
 I'm paranoid, bitch, I can't sleep 
 Niggaz tryin' to get me, man, gimme my heat 
 Put one under my pillow, one under my seat 
 Niggaz lookin' at me like I'm somethin' to eat 
 I had a dream niggaz got me 
 Woke up and niggaz shot me 
 I ain' slept in three days my eyes red 
 Somethin' wrong with my head 
 The mack stashed right under the pillow on my bed 
 It's not hot, why the fuck am I sweatin' 
 My heart beatin', I'm buggin', I reckon 
 Bitch, don't move, it's dark, I might panic 
 Jus' sit still, I mean it, goddamn it 
 My back against the wall 
 Fuck the world I kill 'em all 
 Ain't a nigga too big or too small 
 Chop 'em down watch 'em fall 
 Watch 'em bleed watch 'um crawl 
 Watch 'em bleed till they gone 
 I'm paranoid, bitch, I can't sleep 
 Niggaz tryin' to get me, man, gimme my heat 
 Put one under my pillow, one under my seat 
 Niggaz lookin' at me like I'm somethin' to eat 
 I'm paranoid, bitch, I can't sleep 
 Niggaz tryin' to get me, man, gimme my heat 
 Put one under my pillow, one under my seat 
 Niggaz lookin' at me like I'm somethin' to eat 
 I can't even fuckin' sleep, I'm paranoid 
 Bitch, quit playin', hand me my heat, I'm paranoid 
 I can't even rest my head, I'm paranoid 
 I'm finna leave me a nigga dead, I'm paranoid 
 What? Niggaz ain't fuckin' with me 
 I wish a nigga would
