If you looked inside of me 
 Would it be the same thing that I see? 
 A heart of endless dreams, so much I wanna give 
 Now I'm dancing in the light, I finally feel alive (finally feel alive) 
 It's what I need to set it free 
 I'm gonna fly so high 
 I'm gonna reach the sky 
 I'm gonna be a star 
 Move my feet to the beat of my heart 
 I'm gonna fly so high 
 Bringing the sun into the night 
 Make you believe in me 
 It's my destiny 
 Rising to a brand new day 
 Working hard to find another way 
 Fear wont keep me down, will you be around? 
 More than just a fantasy 
 Lookin' up through the words in front of me 
 Can't you see... I'm running free! 
 I'm gonna fly so high 
 I'm gonna reach the sky 
 I'm gonna be a star 
 Move my feet to the beat of my heart 
 I'm gonna fly so high 
 Bringing the sun into the night 
 Make you believe in me 
 It's my destiny 
 Live my dreams out loud 
 Go to higher ground 
 The greatest love is what I found 
 I'll give you more... give you morrrrrrre 
 I'm gonna fly so high (so high) 
 I'm gonna reach the sky (reachh the sky) 
 I'm gonna be a star (ooh) 
 Move my feet to the beat of my heart 
 I'm gonna fly so high (so high) 
 Bringing the sun into the night (sun into) 
 Make you believe in me 
 It's my destiny (ooh) 
 I'm gonna fly so high (I'm gonna fly baby) 
 I'm gonna reach the sky (I'm gonna reachh the sky) 
 I'm gonna be a star (ooh) 
 Move my feet to the beat of my heart 
 I'm gonna fly so high 
 Bringing the sun into the night 
 Make you believe in me (believe) 
 It's my destiny (ooh destiny)
