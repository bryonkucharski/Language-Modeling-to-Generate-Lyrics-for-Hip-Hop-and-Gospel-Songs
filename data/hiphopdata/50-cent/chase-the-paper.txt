50 Cent 
 I'm still a rider, I'm still rolling 
 A nigga still hold the steel, that's how I'm owning 
 You chase the hoes, I chase the paper 
 You chase the hoes, I chase the paper 
 You chase the hoes, I chase the paper 
 You're a sucker for love, nigga, I'm money making 
 I'm still a baller, I'm still balling 
 That's five times I ain't picked up, your bitch still calling 
 I'm super ghetto, I'm still with the shit 
 Still pass the steel to my nigga, hit a lick 
 We still mob, niggas steal stuff 
 We still deal after deal, shit is no problem 
 He still love her, she ain't shit 
 Get her a pair of Louboutins, she suck a dick 
 Still real niggas, still will kill 
 Told the still bitch don't squeal, get your cap peeled 
 The Mac filled, black talons, hollow tips 
 Copper-tops, get your ass popped, watch a body drop 
 I'm still a rider, I'm still rolling 
 A nigga still hold the steel, that's how I'm owning 
 You chase the hoes, I chase the paper 
 You chase the hoes, I chase the paper 
 You chase the hoes, I chase the paper 
 You're a sucker for love, nigga, I'm money making 
 Kidd Kidd 
 I'm clean as a motherfucker, still getting my hands dirty 
 Bitches they wanna fuck, grab a glass, you looking thirsty 
 See I'm a gangsta, you soft as R&B singers 
 I'm at a war with the banger, in the club with the shanker 
 Mask on, Lone Ranger, scope on the K, long ranger 
 Rather be alive and rich than die and be famous 
 Live my life in the fast lane, I crash into anything 
 I ain't here to entertain when I let them bullets sing 
 Rims on, Rida Gang, slap the fuck out of you, nigga 
 Trying to pull out your pistol when you know that you're lame 
 You chasing these bitches instead of chasing your paper 
 Niggas taking your bitches while they taking your paper 
 I'm gone 
 50 Cent 
 I'm still a rider, I'm still rolling 
 A nigga still hold the steel, that's how I'm owning 
 You chase the hoes, I chase the paper 
 You chase the hoes, I chase the paper 
 You chase the hoes, I chase the paper 
 You're a sucker for love, nigga, I'm money making 
 Prodigy 
 She on my leg like a little kid 
 She hump my leg like a horny pit 
 Pitbull in a skirt, yeah, I'm a magnet 
 Now I ain't running after no broads, she stuck on my dick 
 I'm a different breed, blame it on my genes 
 Money in my jeans, pockets turn her eyes green 
 She's seeing dollar signs, I'm seeing reasons why 
 Never had to stress no pussy, I'm one of a kind 
 Pretty nigga with a gorgeous gun 
 You die a beautiful death, pull a stunt, look 
 There ain't a bitch more dime than me 
 The thirst is real, she knocking over drinks to get next to me 
 While you

 I'm still a rider, I'm still rolling 
 A nigga still hold the steel, that's how I'm owning 
 You chase the hoes, I chase the paper 
 You chase the hoes, I chase the paper 
 You chase the hoes, I chase the paper 
 You're a sucker for love, nigga, I'm money making 
 Styles P 
 Ghetto niggas still will pick a penny up 
 You outside chasing them hoes throwing your Henny up 
 Little homie loading a semi up 
 Catch him all after the club, tell him to ante up 
 Anyway, each and every day, I'm looking for a better way 
 You owe me, you better pay 
 Ghost, let the Beretta spray 
 Hood want uncut dope and some better yea 
 I ain't chasing pussy, never have 
 Hustle hard, take a break, run and get some head and ass 
 Still robbing, still rolling, still need a mask 
 Still popping, still slinging, still need the cash

 You chase the hoes, I chase the paper 
 You chase the hoes, I chase the paper 
 You're a sucker for love, nigga, I'm money making
