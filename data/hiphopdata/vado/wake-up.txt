It's no rules no parameters 
 Started off in high school was a amateur 
 Copping shit you can't move bulit the stamina 
 I told my youth make moves don't let em' stand witcha' 
 Checks blank 100 K or more? 
 Lets make a bank tour 
 Whatever you seen I seen more 
 Plenty beef your heat freeze I squeezed off 
 Phantom Hard top but the seats soft 
 My man up looking down on me like a seesaw 
 I don't know what happened before but times is rough I need enough to make my feet warm 
 "I woke up to some haze holding my pen steady 
 They say the Lord on his way tell him I been ready 
 As I inhale to the song 
 It's Obvious that where I'm from was hell all along" 
 I heard enough like enough is enough 
 I see a lot of rappers coming from under that bus 
 No matter what they ain't fucking with us 
 Every Line is a uppercut plus one to the gut 
 Ask Bishop I had the best Juice 
 Can't be cool with 'em n**** only respect shoot 
 Check scams credit cards we did it 
 Build a plan my advance gon get all the equipment 
 The streets talking I always will listen 
 Always think on the money so I'm Paying attention 
 They Like man that kid glow 
 In a pepto bismol color gran turismo 
 After me there is no That could? head crack leave with his dough 
 That make them sick to they stomachs 
 Throwing up on this shit 'cause I don't spit I vomit 
 Heavy grip four fifth lift if you want it 
 Every trip whole clique even N***** with warrants 
 I'm like Nino I see money 
 The world is mine there's really no need for G money 
 Your girl is mine you eating but see your team hungry 
 That's word to mine them fingers can't take a thing from me
