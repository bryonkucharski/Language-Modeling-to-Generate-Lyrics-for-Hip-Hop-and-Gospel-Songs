 I'm stressed out nigga, I'm stressed out nigga 
 Sittin' on my bed, starin' at the roof 
 Loadin' up my strap, puttin' on my bulletproof 
 These niggas gettin' shady in the streets of snake enem 
 Wanna fill me with venum but I got heaters in my denums 
 They think I ain't gonna do 'em, I'm a make 'em all believers 
 Send 'em to the morgue, walk his momma to the freezer 
 Identify the body "a lady is dat cho baby" 
 Lookin' like swiss cheese smellin like gravy 
 They talkin' like they wanna see me so I'm in they face look 'em in 
 The eyes fo' I had they ass erased 
 You wanna play we can spray all day 
 What chu niggas say " I bring the funk where you stay" 
 You can't handle this scandalous nigga raised by the streets 
 Live and die by the heat and all I want is bloody meat (bloody meat) 
 Just ta live ta see another dayis a blessin' 
 Why I got ta be the one stuck in stress 
 Been through alot a shit I ain't the one ta test 
 Feel like I'm goin' crazy in this land full a stress 
 (I'm stressed out nigga, I'm stressed out nigga) 
 Tryin' ta get some money these niggas wanna off me 
 Homies wanna see me fall bitches wanna cross me 
 (I'm stressed out nigga, I'm stressed out nigga) 
 (Celly Cel) 
 What they gonna do with me, 'cause I don't fuck them suckers 
 They ain't cool with me 
 Act a fool with me and see the G waitin ta come 
 Out, Magnum catch 'em on the run it's on 
 Fools don't understand how I shoot this shit 
 Got my steel toes on bout ta boot this bitch 
 In the ass, thinkin's she's gonna get a pass from me 
 You either jump out da trunk come and blast with me 
 On the enemy the henasy be blurin my vision 
 I might make the wrong decesion 
 If you planin on livin' 
 Don't fuckin' wit a hog give me daft and bass 
 Or yo homey gonna be sayin' this is for my 
 Homies pourin out a fory ounce 
 Reminsion wishin y'all was still on a mission 
 But yo punk ass wouldn't listen itchin ta take my 
 Frustations out on the next man with no question 
 'Cause I'm stressin 
 (Celly Cel) 
 Ain't nothin' left ta do but drink brew 
 Kick it with my crew and think about makin' revenues 
 I didn't choose ta struggle but cha got ta be under 
 Before ya bubble and the big game pays double 
 So I had ta get my hands on that 
 When ya in the hood ain't no other players than that, 
 That microsoft computer chip waddn't important 
 The only way ta college is if ya ball like jordan 
 Grip like griffey hittin homers in the majors 
 Cut back an charge like terel davis 
 If it ain't like that then ya stuck out here with me 
 Start wonderin why if ya still livin' then ya a g 
 Tommarow ain't promised motherfuckers 
 Eat shit and die I run the streets and be a hustler 
 If they cross me I'm a put they ass ta rest 
 Don't be fuckin' with a nigga when hes stressin
