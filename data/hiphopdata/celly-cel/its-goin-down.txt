 It's goin' down tonight, you know I gots to go get fitted 
 Hit the mall to get it, then I stop to get my hair 
 Twisted up in pony tails 
 Then sell a bill, back to the grain 
 And let my peoples know, you know it's goin' down tonight 
 Merry livin' 
 I got the 4-1-1 on the bumpin' 
 We ridin' we them heat, as if they funk 
 And them we dumpin' 
 I'm slumpin' in the meantime 
 My speakers is jumpin' up out they box 
 I see these broads choosin', man they sprung on my Shirly locks 
 Ugh, made the block 
 And they was all up on my bumper 
 Tryin' to pull me over 
 But now I gets a nothin' when I'm sober 
 Hit the gas and smoked it up, smashed off, I'm outtie 
 Bendin' corners, laughin' 'cause I left they car cloudy 
 Went to my partna house and they was postin', splittin', Vegas 
 Bet 5 dollas a game on Mat and 95 on Sega 
 Taggin' out the room, fools layin' on the ground 
 They better have some get back 'cause tonight it's goin' down

 1 - It's goin' down tonight 
 Tonight it goes down 
 It's goin' down tonight 
 Tonight it goes down 
 It's goin' down tonight 
 Tonight it goes down 
 It's goin' down tonight 
 Tonight it's gonna go down 
 (Celly) 
 Closed up shop on the Sega, now we slammin' bones 
 Up in my hood, it's on, we make a casino up out yo' home 
 Head up, I sets 'em down fast for the stash 
 Yellin' "stand up!" when you pass 
 Turn over your bones and give me your cash 
 I hit the store with the money I won to get me a 4-0 
 A double O on the scene, I'm a O-G on the ink fo' sho' 
 I get twisted up in knots, ?per? straight sloppy 
 Prize breaders on my nuts and haters wanna knock me 
 Can't understand how deep I get 
 When I split this real on real da real 
 Straight up out they heels due 
 In a minute we'll still talk 
 Boots stompin', outta my head 
 To the womp, and get my knees dirty 
 When I'm stinkin', I'm on da dots for Thompson 
 Side bettin', Little Joe in the doe 
 Now watch me roll 
 I let 'em go and watch that double duece lock up fo' sho' 
 I talk static, clown 
 Walkin' around and makin' my rounds 
 Snatchin' my money up off the ground 
 'Cause tonight it's goin' down 
 (Celly) 
 Shot to the house to get dressed, it's finally night fall 
 Jumped in my 7-4, smashed it, 'cause I'm tight y'all 
 Checkin' to see if the tape was on the passenger seat 
 I need some heat 
 The only way I'm gon' creep 
 Late night through these faulty streets 
 Hit the block and seen the whole crew on the corner 
 Smellin' that aroma, talkin' about the bump and comin' up on her 
 Super fast, sumpin' cool 
 You know how we do it 
 Touch 'em wit some game 
 And fill 'em wit some dick fluid 
 We hit then store, it's about 30 playas bailin' in 
 Give me some C & B, some Hennessy, & Sequels Gin 
 Let me squeeze but no chasin', fool we straight lacin' 
 Jumpin' and mobbin', punchin' till the both of us playas racin' 
 We pulls up and see 'em posted outside 
 Gettin' gone 
 I'm in the zone, ready to take me somethin' home 
 Wall to wall breaders, top notch, it's mean, it's goin' down 
 At this bump I found 
 Tonight fool, it's goin' down 
 Repeat 1 to fade
