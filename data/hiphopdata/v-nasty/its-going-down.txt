What's hannin' bitch? 
 Betcha cain't do it like me 
 Haha 
 Bitch, its Nasty! 
 Look 
 These bitches be frontin', they don't know hustlin' 
 Don't gangbang, bitch I be duckin' 
 Outside with the squad we on beat bussin' 
 Investigation be quiet, say nothin' 
 Mobbin' in public, I ain't change shit 
 My teeth and my chain match the gold on my wrist 
 Don't rap bout that life if that ain't what you live 
 Why you actin' like a child and you far from a kid 
 Long nights in my cell man I write my own shit 
 Kidnappin hoes like I'm on some home alone shit 
 I'm the only V-Nasty like some "never clone" shit 
 You could crown me the king, bitch I'm on my throne shit 
 Hunnid k in my closet, double that, what I sleep on 
 You bitches pawns in the game Ima be on, you could be gone 
 I hope you ready, bitch it's going down 
 Its goin' down, its goin' down 
 I'm in ya city, bitch, its goin' down 
 I'm mobbin, I'm (?), I'm ridin', we slidin' 
 And we slidin' in a bitch its goin' down 
 It's goin' down, its goin' down! 
 I kill a bitch quick she want another round 
 I'm up top, she in the ground 
 You say you goin' loud, well I don't hear a sound
