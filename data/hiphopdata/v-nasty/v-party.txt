What's that in my crib? 
 A party! 
 House so big, that's gnarly 
 Whip game party, wrist game party, rich game party 
 Insane party!

 I pulled up to my party, in my new Ferrari 
 What's this in my water? 
 Shit this must be molly 
 This bitch is hella drunk, she lookin' hella sorry 
 Rich chandelier, r-r-retarded 
 Who's knockin' at the door? 
 Hugh Hefner! 
 Party goin' crazy, who could do it better? 
 Bitch you ain't invited, unless you gettin' cheddar 
 This bitch is hella wet, so bring an umbrella 
 Whole street blocked off - traffic 
 This is my party! - r-ratchet 
 Shit you never seen - magic 
 Don't sit on my couch! 
 That's Versace fabric 
 I (?) in Liberace, bitches snortin' (?) 
 This ain't once a month, bitch we do this all the time 
 I walked into my room, bitches butt-naked 
 Party, party, party, let's all get wasted! 
 Party! At my residence 
 Everybody here, we even got the president (Obama) 
 You ain't at my party, bitch you irrelevant 
 Rockstar wasted, bitch we hella bent 
 Speakers so loud, we blowin' out the windows 
 (?) this party (?), they blowin' out the (?) 
 Runnin' trains on a bitch, monkey in the middle 
 All hoes suckin' dick, Nintendo 
 It's my party, I'll get high if I want to 
 You ain't my bitch, so you know I don't want you 
 (?) off drank, ooh I caught you! 
 Said you want another shot? 
 Well my bartender ain't got you 
 Be mad if you wan't to 
 Bitch I'm a party animal! 
 Bitches eatin' bitches out, cannibal 
 Five-o at the party 
 That's not understandable 
 They was at the door, I let 'em in 
 I got manners, too!
