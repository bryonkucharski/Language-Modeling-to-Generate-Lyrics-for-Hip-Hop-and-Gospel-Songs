 So I'm all up on yo girl right now

 Fuck it my team winnin' so I throw a couple millions

 Said that Maybach I'm in it 
 Credit card no limit 
 Bad bitches be grinnin' 
 Fuck yo ho, we winnin' 
 Rolex on my wrist, 40 on my hip 
 50 round my neck, 60 hoes on my dick 
 We all got Benz, you ain't fuckin' with my clique 
 12 our flights so you know I'm takin' trips 
 Rich forever like I ain't never goin' broke 
 Billion dollar bitch that you'll never get to know 
 Came from nothin', straigt up out the O 
 Million on my mind, man you know this kid go

 Credit card no limit, I just bought out True Religion 
 My whole team winnin' so you know we all on 
 Just bought a whole street, my money still on 
 Bought a new (?) gave the keys to moms 
 G5 jets, takin' trips to Mars 
 What I'mma do with all these cars?

 Your hoes stay be active

 Brand new Lamborghini, bitch I'm ridin' in them horses 
 Money talk to the ceiling, your must have a shortage 
 Shoes $1500, and yo ass can't afford it! 
 I'm always countin' money, said I always got a profit 
 If I ever went broke, I'd be runnin' through your pockets 
 I'm a millionaire, you could call me a rich kid 
 Buy new whip every month 'cause bitch I'm on my rich shit 
 Girl you can not fuck with me unless you is a rich chick 
 I'm on my Dave Chapelle shit 
 I'm rich bitch!
