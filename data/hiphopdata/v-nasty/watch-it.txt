Cause I'm high right now 
 And I ain't comin' down 
 Haha, Nasty 
 Okay 
 50k in ones (dance) 
 Cocaine on my gums 
 Kush up in my lungs 
 All my bitches going dumb (Aye) 
 Damn that ass is fake 
 But, damn them tits is real 
 She crushin' up them pilla 'cause she loves the way it feels 
 I know I give you chills' 
 My game is extra cold 
 Gotta pocket full of money and my bitches on the stroll 
 'Cause they all do what they told 
 Bitch it's Nasty, Vanessa 
 I pimp her, you stress her 
 You trickin' off them (?) tryin' to impress her 
 Pour the champagne on her chest 
 Smoke a blunt and then undress her 
 She got down on her knees 
 I told her that I bless her 
 Put the .40 on the dresser 
 20k up in my safe 
 These bitches hella fuckin' high, they can't feel they face 
 I'm high up off them drugs 
 I sip, I smoke 
 Bad bitches only cause that's all a bitch know 
 I pop, I sip, I lean I smoke 
 Throw my money up and watch it... 
 Spin down the pole, spin down the pole 
 I throw my money up and watch her spin down the pole 
 I pop, I sip, I lean, I smoke 
 Throw my money up and watch it... 
 Nasty! 
 Aka stay poppin' them rubber bands 
 Too loyal for the other side, I don't fuck with them other (?) 
 She spinnin' round the pole, something like a ceiling fan 
 The baddest bitch I ever seen 
 Swear to god this ho be killin' it 
 I throw my hunnids up 
 Watch her spin down on that pole 
 Face like Halle Berry and that ass out of control 
 I pop, I sip, I smoke, lets blow 
 (?) lets go 
 I'm the dopest of the dope 
 Anywhere I'm standin' you a basic ass bitch 
 My life is outstandin 
 In the club I'm throwin' thousands 
 Watch them bitches fall 
 My whole team here bitch watch us while we ball
