 (Ladies and gentlemen) 
 The party will continue 
 (The party will continue) 
 In 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 
 Party ain't over 'til 6 O'clock 
 But my man got the hook up at the Marriott 
 We can scoop somethin' from the wildest spot 
 And la, di, da, da, da 
 Party ain't over 'til 6 O'clock 
 But my man got the hook up at the Marriott

 And la, di, da, da, da 
 Tip toe through the tulips 'scuse me 
 Looking for a night like Q-T? 
 Bad momma driven like rule me 
 With a body type type like eww-wee 
 Couple cosmos and she ready to leave 
 Don't care where she goin', she just rollin' with me 
 Got her ever so tight in the back of the jeep 
 More like an Isley brother, sister between the sheets 
 Over 18, love sex and weed 
 Won't get mad, if I won't do her but she'll still do me 
 Want me to spank her while I bang her on the balcony 
 The more I close hang her, well the more she screams 
 The car stopping, dogs barkin', the whole world can see 
 If it ain't botherin' shorty, it ain't fuckin' with me 
 Ya know what I mean, oochie-wally sing it for me 
 La, di, da, da, da, sing it for me 
 Party ain't over 'til 6 O'clock

 Slide me your number like hey yo 
 Keep it on the low 
 Boyfriend sittin' at the bar next door 
 Right there, shorty damn near touchin' my nose 
 I don't know how she gonna do it 
 But I'm ready to go 
 Club hot but I wanna go somewhere that's cold 
 AC, king size, on the fifth floor 
 (You know) 
 That's just the way I roll 
 Same way you can roll if you go with the flow 
 C'mon handle your business and a duck your nigga 
 Soon as I duck these chickens, we gonna, get the gettin' 
 Can't wait to dig in the kitty, you got my attention 
 Your itty bitty waist, got me twitchin' in my britches 
 Feanin' for that sticky icky come get me 
 Good God almighty, hot dog and chili 
 Hmm, oochie-wally sing it for me, sing it for me

 Quiero que me evas, contigo, esta noche papi? 
 No speak espanol, Ebonics 
 Bang bang boogie, the chocolate chip cookie 
 The papa don, the pick and prime, pink pretty 
 Smother me, tell me you love me, blow my head up 
 Everything you say can be a lie 
 Just treat me right, come with me tonight 
 It's like all good, and a-all right 
 C'mon baby girl just tell me you want it 
 And we'll be jumpin' 'til 6 in the morning 
 Party ain't over 'til 6 o'clock
