Today we will be discussing... Love 
 (I don't think you hear me though) 
 Is there anyone... (I don't think you hear me though) 
 Is there anyone... (I don't think you, I don't think you).. 
 Anyone... in love? 
 I shoulda known better than to be out here fuckin' with you 
 Knowin' the shit you do 
 I shoulda known better than to be out here fuckin' with you 
 All that shit you took a nigga through 
 I told myself that everything would work out fine 
 (I fucked 'round and hit it) 
 Fucked around and slipped and hit that pussy one mo' time 
 (I fucked 'round and hit it) 
 And got caught up in something that's worse than drugs 
 I'm a motherfuckin' fool for love. 
 And I'm just a (just a) just a (just a) 
 A motherfuckin' fool for love. 
 (Verse One) 
 Man, I was sure I had Ms. Perfect 
 I was settling down 
 Through fuckin' round 
 Most the time I stayed at her house 
 Spent all my time, with her when we stayed in the town 
 Thought this shit right here was really bout to work out 
 Quickly found out, that wasn't her intentions 
 Shorty phone used to ring e're five seconds 
 Ain't pay attention 
 She would always take her calls in the kitchen 
 Go to the sink, runnin' water like she washin' dishes 
 Ain't tryin' a listen 
 I know how them shorties is 
 Always in somebody business 
 Gossipin', shootin' bullshit with her girlfriend 
 One day feelin' like a joker 
 Told her I wasn't comin' over 
 Jive got me on the last flight out to Arizona, what I told her 
 Went over unexpected 
 Rung the bell (ding dong!) Domino's (just a second!) 
 Opened the door with the robe on 
 She only put on, when she naked as the day she was born 
 I'm just standin' there with crossed arms 
 Then her baby car came out 
 Lookin' at me like ("Nigga wha's wrong?!") 
 Wha's wrong?!? 
 I shoulda known better than to be out here fuckin' with you 
 Knowin' the shit you do 
 I shoulda known better than to be out here fuckin' with you 
 All that shit you took a nigga through 
 I told myself that everything would work out fine 
 (I fucked 'round and hit it) 
 Fucked around and slipped and hit that pussy one mo' time 
 (I fucked 'round and hit it) 
 And got caught up in something that's worse than drugs 
 I'm a motherfuckin' fool for love. 
 And I'm just a (just a) just a (just a) 
 A motherfuckin' fool for love. 
 (Verse Two) 
 If I ain't just get outta prison, 
 Man listen, I'd a did him 
 By Kentucky Fried Chicken, and the nigga, I ain't bullshittin' 
 Glad I had my man with me 
 He fast, turned me around 
 Pulled me out the house 
 To the car, nigga we out 
 I'm madder than a muhfucker, heart tore up 
 Lookin' for a clip to dry this off the side of (whoo!) 
 Man I caught him in the house wit' my girl 
 Damn 'cause that shit was fucked up 
 Fuck her,... just like the rest of 'em 
 I'm a tell ya somethin', I can't front 
 We been broke up for a couple of months 
 And I done called her up we talked 
 I ain't mad as I was 
 She ain't doin' no mo' than I done 
 Ya know?, just got caught wit her's 
 Hit me right here when she told me she still had my stuff 
 (Want me to bring it?) can you stay when you come? 
 (Uh huh) DAMN! 
 I shoulda known better than to be out here fuckin' with you 
 Knowin' the shit you do 
 I shoulda known better than to be out here fuckin' with you 
 All that shit you took a nigga through 
 I told myself that everything would work out fine 
 (I fucked 'round and hit it) 
 Fucked around and slipped and hit that pussy one mo' time 
 (I fucked 'round and hit it) 
 And got caught up in something that's worse than drugs 
 I'm a motherfuckin' fool for love. 
 And I'm just a (just a) just a (just a) 
 A motherfuckin' fool for love. 
 (Verse Three) 
 Sheeeit, I ain't a sucker 'cause 
 Shit, I can't help that I love her 
 My baby got some good stuff 
 I'm coo-coo for coco puffs 
 Time to break out the candles 
 And old Marvin Gaye 
 Huh, let me straighten up 
 Aw, you know what? 
 Hmmm, lemme call her back 
 Where I put her number at? 
 Ain't it 757-23... yeah, 36 
 See if she want some fish 
 I can fix it 'fore she get here 
 Man, I hope my boo ain't left yet 
 Aw, come on, come on 
 Know you on the other line an' shit 
 (Hi Derek!) Derek!?! what the..? (Pablo?) BITCH! 
 I shoulda known better than to be out here fuckin' with you 
 Knowin' the shit you do 
 I shoulda known better than to be out here fuckin' with you 
 All that shit you took a nigga through 
 I told myself that everything would work out fine 
 (I fucked 'round and hit it) 
 Fucked around and slipped and hit that pussy one mo' time 
 (I fucked 'round and hit it) 
 And got caught up in something that's worse than drugs 
 I'm a motherfuckin' fool for love. 
 And I'm just a (just a) just a (just a) 
 A motherfuckin' fool for love. (x3, until fade)
