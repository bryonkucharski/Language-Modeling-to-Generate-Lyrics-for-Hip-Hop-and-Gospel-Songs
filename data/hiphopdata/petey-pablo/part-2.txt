(Petey Pablo: Talking) 
 Ladies and gentlemen, I am proud to present to you today 
 The new album from Petey Pablo, "Still Writing in My Diary: The 2nd Entry" 
 The boy hot now; he been gone for a little while, had a little vacation, enjoyin' life 
 But that's what you're supposed to do when you get there: enjoy your life 
 Y'naw'mean, 'cause this ain't promised to us tomorrow, we can lose this shit tonight 
 Ya understand what I'm sayin' 
 But this young man that I'm bringin' before you today, has done it all 
 He's been at the lowest of the low, he's been at the top of the world 
 And he still remains grounded, that's a trill nigga, street cat 
 A fine young man, and I'm very proud to 
 Be able to say that I even know the young fellow 
 But without further ado, because I know you've been waitin' 
 Still writin' in his diary, the 2nd entry 
 My mama said, "Can you give her 3 dollars for a 5 dollar book of food stamps 
 So she can get her some cigarettes?" (laughs) 
 Ya see, I go through some shit called voice exercisin' 
 When I go in the booth, and I go in there 
 And I just lay a hook now 'n' then, know what I'm sayin' 
 Like this shit right here 
 (Chorus: Repeat 2x) 
 Time to take them shirts off again (put 'em back up in the air) 
 Represent, represent (put 'em back up in the air) 
 I really need you to mean it, mean it, mean it (put 'em back up in the air) 
 Start up that South shit again (put 'em back up in the air) 
 (Petey Pablo) 
 What you want this time, more fire? 
 No problem, I got it (I got it) 
 Y'all better be ready to call the motherfuckin' firetruck 
 To come up in this bitch an' put me out (yeah, yeah) 
 Petey Pab, back in the house, puttin' it down (I brought this fire, baby) 
 Stronger than we've ever been baby boy 
 Y'all in trouble now (now now now now now now) 
 If y'all ain't ready (ready), better find your door 
 It's time to go and y'all gotta get out 
 All up in the wheels and under your heels 
 And let the best thing to roll you out 
 If you been there (been there), I ain't got to talk to you about it 
 It don't get more gangsta, gangsta than it gets in the South 
 (Chorus: Repeat 2x) 
 (Petey Pablo) 
 Got another rake, got another lawn mower, got another hoe 
 A brand new weed wacker, with diamonds on the top where you hold 
 Got a water hose, an the the thing you wind it up on 
 Carolina candy painted float to go with my pose 
 I be out there in that water 'round them rich white folks 
 Ain't caught no fish yet, but guess what, dog; I look good in that boat 
 I'm just as country as the day I was born, I love it 
 Say my name for me (Mmmmmm mmmmmm P-P-Petey Pab, mutha fucka) 
 Bob your head, get your thang off, show ya set 
 Look around ya boy, if that ain't there the South at its best 
 We run this shit here, all this shit here, nigga, look at me man 
 The Jack ain't why you should be worried, it's the Ace in my hand 
 (Chorus: Repeat 2x) 
 (Petey Pablo) 
 I'm sendin this song out to everybody that took the time when out an got my shit 
 Record store, bootleg, on the corner and everywhere my CD at 
 I take my hat off, if it weren't for y'all, I wouldn't be nothin' at all 
 And Carolina would still be two states, y'all motherfuckers used this to drive across 
 Do you see anything on my goddamn face that look like I'm playin'? 
 Have I said anything tonight, that y'all motherfuckin' niggaz ain't understand? 
 Did I leave when I had a reason, talk to me man! 
 Naw I stayed, 'cause this where I was born and raised 
 (And I) I swear on everything I love 
 I'ma do my best to keep doin' it for us 
 And I don't need a gold or a platinum plaque 
 Just some down at home country love (country love) 
 I don't ask for much (huuuuuh huuuuh) 
 That's enough to keep my heart in the court (huuuuuh huuuuh) 
 Tell the truth, it's really messin' me up 
 To see all y'all niggaz still raisin' up (ooh) 
 (Chorus: Repeat 2x) 
 (Yeah, yeah, yeah) Put 'em back up in the air 
 (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) (Repeat 4x) 
 (Chorus: Repeat 2x)
