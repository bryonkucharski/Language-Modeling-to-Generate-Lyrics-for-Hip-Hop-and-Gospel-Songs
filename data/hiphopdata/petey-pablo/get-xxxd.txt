 Hit a cop then hit a nun 
 It's all wit a gun 
 What is done is what is done 
 It's all for the fun 
 Somebody said I cut off their head its already done 
 Yo I'm black wit many straps

 With a bat my clipped on I'm bangin' with that 
 Where it's at is where it's at 
 Don't worry bout that

 Now take a ride as we roll through the ghetto 
 But keep your foot on the pedal 'cause it can get pretty extreme in the ghetto 
 Triple xxx level no hold bar we got hood capped and lieutenants and project sergeants 
 Capable of pullin' your carden bombin' your car grenades through your windows 
 This is all out war take the main road anywhere we go every time we role 
 Have me transportin' guns stashed in the truck flow 
 Real talk dog I hit real hard one swing knock a motherfucker block slam off 
 Hit him in the part where he talk from 
 Now he got a momma cause the y's in the jaw make it hard for him to tell you somethin' 
 The sun ain't down but the storm comin' 
 The best thing for you to do is try to get prepared for it 
 They find him bread water milk a couple cans of soup 
 And a place to go just in case you had to move 
 (J-Kwon) 
 Runnin' when it comes to the twos 
 I'm not forgiving the blues 
 Ill knock another man clean out his shoes 
 We get to breakin' the rules 
 Let's get to takin' them jewels 
 He still trippin' lets turn his ass into dog food 
 Who got the static huh 
 Who bring the blasting huh 
 The automatic huh 
 And let them have it 
 Chump I'm a savage what 
 Let me show you magic bro 
 One shot of this ill turn your ass into sawdust 
 I know we lawless 
 I'm talkin' all us 
 When it come handlin' business 
 Dirty we flawless 
 See these revolvers 
 That's why they call us 
 The same reason the police ain't never caught us 
 I'm on another level words from a true rebel 
 I rock your ass and I ain't talkin' heavy metal 
 You just a crumb 
 And me I'm a dirt devil 
 Lets see what's left as soon as the smoke settle
