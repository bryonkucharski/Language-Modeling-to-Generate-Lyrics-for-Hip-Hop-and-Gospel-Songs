 Diary of a sinner, huh, 1st entry 
 Dear diary, this the 1st time 
 I had a chance to sit and just think with a clear mind 
 Has a homeboy stressed out for a little while, few things ain't work out 
 Could somebody come out or it's about 3:29, I'll give it about another hour 
 I'm over here at your man house 
 On your man couch, just puttin' these thoughts down 
 Maybe this right here one day will be worth something 
 Before we start messin up 
 You know you get big when you leave, it's a damn shame 
 But that's the way that it gotta be huh, 
 Look at Malcolm X, Martin Luther King 
 Marvin Gaye, Tupac, B.I.G. and Big Pun damn this pen messy 
 A motherfucker had thought 
 And I had to write 'em down 
 It's the diary, of a sinner 
 A motherfucker had thought 
 Then I had to write 'em down 
 Liven life as a born loser 
 Liven in a world that I didn't see oh 
 Damn, I'm back, I had to change pen, I done got ink everywhere 
 All over my hand, and on my pant and how in the hell I get it way down there 
 Just can't get it right 
 Seem that everything I do just fall on one side 
 But I can say one thing, I don't always get mine, and I don't ever stop tryin' 
 Feel like I was here before my time 
 People say when they hear my rhyme 
 People see it when they look in my eye it's like? 
 Like 35 years on a 26 year life 
 I done walk so many miles in these shoes 
 I'm surprise that the bottom ain't wore out 
 I'm about to go take a walk right now 
 Mmmm hmmm 
 It wha good ta me, a little walk 
 Just what I needed, cool breeze, nobody on the street with me 
 My own little world of peace 
 But reality gotta be what it gotta be 
 And nuttin in the book said, life will to be sweet 
 I'm pleased with the life that was given to me 
 I could of still been sleep 
 On my way so please when none this here will matter to me 
 'Cause, know when I messed up, several times 
 I just done something tonight 
 And I know I know right from wrong 
 And that's what kill me 
 I still do the wrong thing 
 Am I crazy, can't believe I got a damn diary 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 Liven life, liven life 
 Oh a diary, a diary oh 
 And it's written on paper oh 
 Can't you just see it 
 All of my life oh, 
 All of my life oh, 
 All of my life 
 All of x3 
 All of my life oh lright 
 Oh it's the diary of a sinner 
 (Petey Pablo) 
 There it is, my life 
 Right there, right in your face 
 The diary, I wanna thank everybody that went out and picked up the album 
 Got the album, and got a chance to understand who, who I'm is 
 Know what I'm sayin', everything I gave y'all was the truth 
 Damn I ran out of time
