(Silkk the Shocker) 
 Ya boy Shocker in the building 
 Heads Remain Anonymous 
 He Ain't Gotta Be Obvious 
 Ladies, if y'all thirsty, drinks on me 
 And you fake ballers, you know what to do 
 (Master P In Background) 
 Girls, We Like Dem Girls 
 We Gotta Have Them Girls 
 We Like Dem Girls, Girls, Girls, Girls 
 [Master P] + (Silkk the Shocker) 
 And y'all haters 
 Be gone, want, want want 
 Be gone, want, want want 
 Be gone, want, want want, Be Gone 
 You get money, (then take it to the floor) 
 You got game, (then take it to the floor) 
 You ain't scared, (then take it to the floor) O 
 You came to party, (then take it to the floor) 
 (Silkk the Shocker) 
 Just waking up in the morning, gotta thank god 
 I Don't Know but last night seemed kinda odd 
 The spot was hot, the place was packed 
 They had fat asses wall to wall and back to back 
 Imagine that, it was a hell of a scene 
 Either that or it was a hell of a dream, ya heard me 
 They had a few ballers but not that many 
 A lot of model-type chicks but not that skinny 
 I mean one in particular caught my eye 
 I mean she gave me a look when I walked by 
 Like "Yeah, we about to have some fun here" 
 Her mouth ain't move but her body sayin' come here 
 Want want want so I passed the key 
 And got a hotel suite like Cassidy 
 And Kel, So I yell let's blaze the party 
 And something started up and it sounded like Atari 
 (Chorus: Master P) 
 Girls, We Like Dem Girls 
 We Gotta Have Them Girls 
 We Like Dem Girls, Girls, Girls, Girls 
 Girls, We Like Dem Girls 
 We Gotta Have Them Girls 
 We Like Dem Girls, Girls, Girls, Girls 
 (Silkk The Shocker) 
 My girls look, let's get it crackin' 
 It don't take much, let's make it happen 
 She thinkin' we gettin' on tha highway 
 I'm like mike look we still in tha driveway 
 And look, I can have you flossin' 
 In a house big enough you can get lost in 
 Let's spend tha weekend, 
 Play some lil' monopoly, and some hide-and-go-seek'in 
 And I'm back as tha pool 
 So you wanna take a dip she like, " Yeah, that's cool" 
 See me and these thugs came to act a fool 
 The new no limit, we don't play by the rules 
 I came to party, not to clap tha game 
 To get tha see out of jail 'cause it's time to get paid 
 Up and down, I ain't talkin' my ways 
 In tha bentley gettin' my hair done, I ain't talkin' bout braids 
 Shorty, tell me what your name is? 
 Playa, tell me what your game is? 
 Shorty, tell me why you came here? 
 Playa, show me what you working with? 
 (Chorus: Master P) 
 Girls, We Like Dem Girls 
 We Gotta Have Them Girls 
 We Like Dem Girls, Girls, Girls, Girls 
 (Master P) 
 I'm country mayne, I'll punch ya brain 
 I'll roll with the boys that'll pluck ya mayne 
 You get money, you better tuck ya mayne 
 The haters out here, they'll cut ya mayne 
 Get lose with it, stay true with it 
 We don't want it if you let bruce bruce hit it 
 Get lose with it, stay true with it 
 We don't want it if you let bruce bruce hit it 
 Her neck, her back 
 We can fix it in my Lac 
 Her neck, her back 
 We can fix it in my Lac 
 (Chorus: Master P) 
 Girls, We Like Dem Girls 
 We Gotta Have Them Girls 
 We Like Dem Girls, Girls, Girls, Girls 
 Girls, We Like Dem Girls 
 We Gotta Have Them Girls 
 We Like Dem Girls, Girls, Girls, Girls 
 (Silkk over Chorus) 
 Shorty, I'ma get with you 
 But like Chingy, I'm only one call away 
 I mean I'm a baller, take that away 
 I'll call you heh
