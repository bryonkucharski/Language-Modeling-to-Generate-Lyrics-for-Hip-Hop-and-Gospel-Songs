With no hopes 
 And my will to live 
 Barely a care in this world to me 
 I found a way 
 Kidnapped and confined 
 Within a system designed 
 To destroy the inncocent child that I use to be 
 It stripped me mentally naked 
 Embarrassing my mommas first born 
 Did I deserve that kind of fate? 
 Was all that was happening to me 
 Really written in the powerful and allmighty book of life? 
 I don't think so 
 My tears would soak the pages that I write upon 
 If I couldn't close the windows to my soul 
 And stand strong in the midst of these storms 
 Maybe my story is 
 In some way or another fimilar with yours 
 Is that why this ain't even a song 
 But yet you still... you wanna here this once more 
 I play this every time I wanna reflect from 
 Which I've come from 
 To help me see were it is I'm trying to go 
 And even though grandma and our sisters 
 Left me some time ago 
 I still go by and sit on the front porch as if I don't even know 
 But I'm getting better 
 My mom 
 My two sisters... ebony and tanya 
 Destiny 
 Man I got mikey and shocker now 
 My homeboyz 
 And those that love me regardless 
 Diary of a sinner 
 Another entry 
 I guess I'll finish this tomorrow
