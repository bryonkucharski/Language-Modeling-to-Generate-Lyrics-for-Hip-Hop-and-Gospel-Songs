 This is for you Capo 
 And we sing the name of capo confucious as we preach 
 The seven that cannot be divided by any number or any one 
 (Ha ha ah) 
 They come to me only for money 
 Don't give 'em a nickel (don't give 'em a shit) 
 My brother was doing it with me until he was tooken (CAPO!) 
 No time to be sleeping around (man these broads ain't shit) 
 They come to me only for money 
 Don't give 'em a nickel 
 They show me the colors 
 My nigga, my brother was doing it with me until he was tooken but it was a struggle 
 It figures no time to be sleeping around 
 Fuckin' with brothers 
 Another one bites the dust 
 Sneaking up on 'em ??? ????? ???? dirty indeed 
 Breathe, puff 
 Where do we go when we do what we do 
 Gimme lickety and roll up the weed for me too 
 Don't you want me to smoke it an drink it in front of you 
 Pull out mah jammy and stick it in one of you ???? ???? ???? seconds no time to waste, that talking, it'll get your face, criminal action, catch a case 
 No more passion when he was mashing' 
 Could my people really be laughing 
 Paying attention to what he was saying to keep from crashing 
 BABY! Let me throw my ashes 
 I was thinking of I could put in words to match em' 
 I watch em' look at the thievery stealing 
 My ???? will always catch him 
 It's a hellafied game, to hell if I fall 
 Pray everyday I hope my memories is still what you see 
 Hellafied ???? I wanna be here everyday I'm gonna miss everybody 
 What about your friends 
 My enemies seem to be creeping deep within

 I only trust god 
 I only put trust in god 
 Never the one to dodge 
 Ever against all the odds 
 Standing alone in a spiritual form 
 I rather be my dammy dawg 
 Rather be my family and I'm not lying just to be looked upon 
 It's someone singing another song 
 Specifically getting mah weakness on 
 Women be right beside me plotting 
 Nobody wants to sidekick 
 Cool when they first met you 
 Now they want the respect that I get 
 Screaming we need to be going though stuff together so we can vibe with 
 Whatever get off that dumb shit 
 You need to be paying more attention to this 
 What am I'm mad/ little I'm pissed considered it 
 While I'm puffing on tropical I'm trying to be logical 
 And I got these people trying to hinder me positive negative 
 It needs to be an obstacle give me progress I'm feeling hollow allowing me time to swallow 
 My enemies' time to talk I open his eyes so he can see 
 He talking in front of a wall 
 He talking he want to be me 
 He walking want to be a rapper, and an actor, and then write a book 
 Mah people in it and plus my equal he ???? and he got the look 
 It's a hellafied game, to hell if I fall 
 Pray everyday I hope my memories is still what you see 
 Hellafied ???? I wanna be here everyday I'm gonna miss everybody

 Lie to me, die for me, cry for me 
 A son of assassin keeping an eye out on me never denying they trying to get close to me hopefully finding from keeping a diary 
 Having a friend around to the end of the time chilling and smoking off fine weed 
 Go to the tele and flip open the celli they ??? ??? y'all always was there for me

 Baby be real with me 
 See give them the whole story before we leave/ nigga you know where we going 
 And this where we opposed to be 
 Baby mama she hating me 
 Confining in her is out of the question 
 Baby it's been a blessing to say that I believing in god 
 The only friend invested 
 Unconditional love, 
 Verbally tested if you will 
 Need to be changed and trying to chill 
 Don't be plotting on making a meal 
 Now that we made it and all of the rappers are keeping it real 
 They'll never take me alive 
 I'm a rap till be killed maneuver the benz they see me ??? ??? ?? seventy-one on my way to Westville follow me all around the field 
 Mumbling hunger pain, spinning the wheel 
 Somebody right beside me wanting a record deal 
 He need to chill 
 Only if its gods will 
 That's the way he'll make the bill 
 That's the way they'll make the buck 
 But niggas don't give a fuck 
 Everybody ?????? a ??????
