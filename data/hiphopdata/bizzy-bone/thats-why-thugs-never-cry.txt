Live by the sword, die by the sword 
 Believe in the Lord, and the laws of the Lord 
 And when you ride for the cause, keep an eye on the cause 
 You ever lose sight, and you blind as a mole 
 We must decide if they rise, decide if they fall 
 Alive with the light, you can shine on 'em all 
 We all designed to be strong, sometimes we'll be right 
 And sometimes we'll be wrong, we must weather the storm 
 It's the design of it all, we'll never know it all 
 Just love one another and honor father and mother 
 When you kind you'll see it grow, with hate you'll never know 
 It's crawled up outta the gutter, the thoughts the spirit help us 
 When you find you're in a hole, you search you're inner soul 
 You search to get the truth, and you find you're way to go 
 It's the design of it all, you'll find what it means 
 A struggle to succeed when life is like a dream 
 That's why the thugs never cry (thugs never cry) 
 From the thunder and rain, just look into my eyes 
 That's why the thugs never cry (thugs never cry) 
 The world is a ghetto, we gots to stay alive 
 That's why the thugs never cry (thugs never cry) 
 We're hoping for change and puffin' on some? 
 That's why the thugs never cry (thugs never cry) 
 Bizzy is back, only the strong survive 
 So wipe the tears with a sleave, and just 'cause you believe 
 One day you gon have what you want, what you gonna be 
 When the winds don't blow, and God don't make mo' 
 Keep an eye on the stone, and oh, just remember 
 The world gets dark, and you carry your heart 
 Just open up your opens eyes, and insipre the whole art 
 From the birds to the bees, the snakes and the trees 
 The lakes and the sea, the brakes in the sea 
 And when the tide ship down, and nobodies around 
 Ain't nothing to be found, and uh... I don't make a sound 
 No nobody and no preasance and yes you're ? the essance 
 Of creation in the making and the patiance of the Satans 
 Ever blessings queen, message to a king, and a gift to a prince 
 Like a gift to a ring, for the love of a slave 
 Yes Adam and Eve, a slave that loved God before she bit the tree 
 That's why the thugs never cry (thugs never cry) 
 From the thunder and rain, just look into my eyes 
 That's why the thugs never cry (thugs never cry) 
 The world is a ghetto, we gots to stay alive 
 That's why the thugs never cry (thugs never cry) 
 We're hoping for change and puffin' on some? 
 That's why the thugs never cry (thugs never cry) 
 Bizzy is back, only the strong survive 
 If you do then you ?, you don't then you? 
 You ever been in that situation without a plan? 
 And if you tried and you can't 
 Just get up out the streets, and hustle to get your money 
 And make sure that you be that 
 I go to church and see sin, get punched in the chin 
 And a brother saves his brother, you'll never do it again 
 And the child drinking Hen, and you're mad at his dad 
 I'm in the army just to keep this whole world in harmony 
 It ain't nothing like Shaq, whose dad walked out 
 Who never knew he'd grow and ride and make it out 
 It's like God and the sun, a flower and a bun 
 A tower and a plane, that never destroyed none 
 It's the design of it all, the time of it all 
 The crime of it all, and the life of it all 
 Pick up your eyes to the sky, and never ask why 
 You really know the answers and I 
 That's why the thugs never cry (thugs never cry) 
 From the thunder and rain, just look into my eyes 
 That's why the thugs never cry (thugs never cry) 
 The world is a ghetto, we gots to stay alive 
 That's why the thugs never cry (thugs never cry) 
 We're hoping for change and puffin' on some? 
 That's why the thugs never cry (thugs never cry) 
 Bizzy is back, only the strong survive
