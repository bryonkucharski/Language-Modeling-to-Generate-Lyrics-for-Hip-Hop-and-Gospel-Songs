(Hit the reefah, hit the reefah) 
 Hit the reefah, take my mind away/ Life struggles for bloody money, cold cash, won't last/ Hit the reefah, take my mind away/ Fucked up game they love me, they don't want me, they want me, they don't love me/ Hit the reefah, take my mind away/ Life struggles for bloody money, cold cash, won't last/ Hit the reefah, take my mind away/ Fucked up game they love me, they don't want me, they want me, they don't love me 
 And so I hit the reefah take my mind away/ Everybodys watchin me when the cops come, niggas is scattered runnin' around till they shot one/ Niggas get picked with the hot ones/ I don't know too many niggas talking about they ain't got one/ They walkin' around fucked up, havin' they mash on, whatever whatever (Whatever whatever dog) they don't know anybody without blastin/ The shits gets real, up up in the field, enemies get killed/ Little kids get (Dada) caught up in the crossfire, but its wide up still/ Shoot 'em up shoot 'em up put 'em up I'm curious/ (Just...) Just to believe in god it's so unworthy us, worthy us, hurry up, before they bury us.../ (Who) Who told you that you just should go? 
 Hit the reefah, take my mind away/ Life struggles for bloody money, cold cash, won't last/ Hit the reefah, take my mind away/ Fucked up game they love me, they don't want me, they want me, they don't love me/ Hit the reefah, take my mind away/ Life struggles for bloody money, cold cash, won't last/ Hit the reefah, take my mind away/ Fucked up game they love me, they don't want me, they want me, they don't love me 
 The force of more horses met 'em all through famine somebody torched the land and revelations of course/ Look at these lost prophets and imposters candidate mantle/ Bless the shrine, trottin with my hoo wap bly/ We're from east 99, east 9 times runnin' now, gunnin now/ Satan's comin' so me no survivors why we refuse to repute/ Scream with a vengeance, our sins'll make you plummet, the chase is on/ Venomous brandish my manic, manage demand it, devil damn it/ They tossed to chase is gone, I'm plottin on my body rottin its on be lost in bondage and I hope you reach the promise land and all/ Not the earth like all of y'all before, rewind
