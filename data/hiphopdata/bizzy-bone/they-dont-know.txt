Hahaha, aight rock your shit homie (c'mon) 
 Ooh, I guess they don't know (know) 
 I'm finna call up David and we marchin on them bitches to the South Pole 
 So what they wanna do with us? I'm finna get'cha get'cha 
 Huh, finna get'cha get'cha get'cha (get'cha) 
 Lord, crush they numbers daddies eyes can see 
 I know Jesus carry me, he ever need me I'm there verily 
 Love the Virgin Mary, Mexican food, without the children 
 With a child shall lead to mommy, daddy love me I'm children 
 Bless the world if it's possible, I cry on my knees 
 Praise the Lord, God almighty the creator of all lightning 
 Ass booty and titans, you know that we been clashin in the brainwaves 
 Rattlin tryna stop what we got 
 Lord a stone cold producer, bad to the bone, I ain't no sell out 
 Betta leave him alone, I'll clear this bitch out 
 Shut the fuck up out of the dust and quickly shake that stick 
 Fuck the lust, do you wonder it's non-physical (physical) 
 Ooh, I guess they don't know (know) 
 I'm finna call up David and we marchin on them bitches to the South Pole 
 So what they wanna do with us? I'm finna get'cha get'cha 
 Huh, finna get'cha get'cha get'cha (get'cha) 
 Deep in the mind where they question me, what do you wanna know? 
 I don't know nothing, but I heard that legend tellin' me take it slow 
 I said, feelin' the body within the body, oh what a blessin 
 And what a breath, you betta go get 'em; better go plant those seeds 
 Deeper, or holdin' the microphone, close to the spirit 
 Clearly I hear that jealousy, somehow I don't fear it 
 And I don't blame nothin', surround as we're surrounded and trapped 
 Call up the police that's bullshit, it's pulpit in fact 
 Until we mack, in the battlefield with the beat like that 
 Baby we serious, I'm not curious, tell 'em to watch that 
 Those ideologies, remember thou shalt not kill, and isn't it bloody enough? 
 Fuck it, we are the soldiers in the rucket rough 
 Ooh, I guess they don't know (know) 
 I'm finna call up David and we marchin on them bitches to the South Pole 
 So what they wanna do with us? I'm finna get'cha get'cha 
 Huh, finna get'cha get'cha get'cha (get'cha) 
 Call up my uncle let me cop that fuckin' Mary J 
 We been out here grindin steadily climbin each and every day 
 Motherfucker don't test me come and arrest me, show me how we play 
 Figure with the spirit, fight you back like I was anime 
 Quick to have a baby sick as fuck and jump right on the stage 
 Comin' up out that limo pockets swollen payin' attention to everything I say 
 Open up the mind with a prayer, as I worship the Lord Jesus 
 The Dragon Slayer say verily, verily I'm reborn 
 Tarnished and torn, burnin up and I'm feelin' scorned 
 It's gettin' warm, I'm finna go turn it up, huh, end of story 
 Prophets and saints so harken with baby Michael's up in the buildin 
 Jesus Christ is yo' pavilion, I'm a thug, I'm in the buildin 
 Ooh, I guess they don't know (know) 
 I'm finna call up David and we marchin on them bitches to the South Pole 
 So what they wanna do with us? I'm finna get'cha get'cha 
 Huh, finna get'cha get'cha get'cha (get'cha)
