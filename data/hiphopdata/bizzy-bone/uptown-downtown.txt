Up in the storm, out of a mirrage 
 Deep in the ghetto, the Lord is in charge 
 Swords comin' out of my mouth, ready can't block the barrage 
 I'm still (dancin; on the side of the blanche)? of the road 
 On the rise like dough, it's fully approach the set for sure 
 I don't wan't no problems, problems, comin' at me fast as a bullet 
 Even a missile, right to the the grizzle, pain sizzlin' my mullet 
 God, do with it told, keepin' the fighting steady at minimum, for sure 
 I better listen to the granddad, baby, only God knows 
 Do what it do, look at the... as others would do to you 
 Do what it do,.. speech impedement, keepin' it true 
 Comin' with proof, automatic heat, with the static, gotta have it in the battle, 
 Trippin' in my boots, movin' in the roof, what I gotta do? 
 Pretty much what I told you, hey 
 One for the money, one for my dunny 
 I'm a move it like officer gunnin' on the block with Christ 
 Spit crack on these dummies, with the four winds tellin' me to do my thang, hunny 
 Keepin' it rockin', hoppin' out of the truck 
 And getcha bucks, and we stuck in this city, idiots signed with a touch 
 And a crime, with a rush, come up don't show your nuts 
 On a line full of souls and spirits, can't be too much 
 And to die for the kings you teach to be just 
 On the minds, gotta preach, divine and rugged rough 
 So we calm in the mountain, wanted the youth; no lust 
 Let me shine, annunciation, pronouciation for your love 
 Hoppin the fences, cuttin' my leg, goin' dutch, what 
 I'm a get a drink before I leave out in these cuffs, cuffs 
 I sit in the county, ready to bail me out, what, what 
 They still ain't paid the bounty, me and my lawyer gettin' crushed 
 It's lucky when they stopped me in Vegas, and then they come up 
 But I'm trusty, loyal, and faithful like angels in the dust 
 Tellin' em', love me and leave me, BB be headin' towards the shhh 
 Me and my body, on the the side, we ride, the tribe is up 
 Headed for destinations, peoples hallucinations in the nation 
 Gravity, and dimensions, comin' aboard the battle station 
 Facin' many adversities, horses, Kentucky Derbys 
 Herses and dead bodies, and worse when it comes early 
 Man, I'm dirty, made pretty through weakness, I'm tellin' you briefly 
 Hey, I don't want no beef, I pray; Allah, please keep me 
 To the people, feed me, secretly, in the G way 
 Leeway (sp?), rollin' on the freeway, leave me 
 Please me, take me to heaven, breathin' with Jesus 
 He quick, with telekinises, don't believe me? go breezy 
 Deem it- hey, hey, I don't know what to say 
 Huh, let's honour the lord, and that's the only way 
 Gotta go, flow, ready to gotta go to work for sure 
 Yo, hustle to be a pro, stack paper and get your flow 
 Whatever it takes... 
 You better go keep it strong 
 In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, Praise God
