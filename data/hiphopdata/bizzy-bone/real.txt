Bizzy bone real (freestyle) lyrics 
 Intro: Bizzy Bone (Chris Notez) 
 (Yeah I'm so real, real, real, real) 
 Driving on the motherfucking freeway and shit, you know what I'm saying? 
 70 motherfucking miles per motherfucking hour 
 You know I?ma reach it up to 75, this how we do it baby 
 Boy get much more motherfucking deeper 
 Man this the motherfucking reaper is hanging on your shoulders 
 I wanna give him a hug and tell him that I love him and I'm getting older 
 And life is getting colder but motherfucker's words are getting bolder 
 Verse 1: Bizzy Bone 
 While I'm walking in the trenches of Cali 
 I'm feeling these motherfuckers wanna see me all fucked up in an alley 
 They wanna see me with no money, they really wanna see me hungry 
 But of course I'm gonna clean myself, I'm feeling lovely 
 As they walking through the matrix, don't even say it 
 Homeless ain't homeless nigga, they ain't boneless 
 And don't play it, ain't no hatred 
 Motherfuckers don't even know, don't even say it 
 Give it back to these niggas, they don't need no knowledge 
 Motherfuckers need to pay some homage 
 I ain't even trying to take your ass to the ghetto or spiritual college 
 Cause these motherfuckers don't know and leather squallas 
 I need a bomber so I can hang through the cold 
 So I can hang through the bold so I can hang with the old 
 Meaning the the ancients as they sitting over and watching 
 This is the way we do it, the time is ticking and it's the clock 
 Chorus: Chris Notez (Bizzy Bone) 
 To heal (I'm a real motherfucker till they kill me) 
 I?ma blaze the weed, hit the drink 
 Baby that's just me (I'm a real motherfucker till they kill me) 
 Yeah I'm so real, real, real, real 
 (x2) 
 Verse 2: Bizzy Bone (Chris Notez) 
 My battles, they be coming in dreams 
 And motherfuckers don't know that I'm seeing through the seams 
 As I crease up the jeans and I buckle the belt 
 And I rock this motherfucker, it ain't for myself 
 And I rock this motherfucker, it ain't for my dealth 
 And I rock this motherfucker, it ain't for my health 
 Cause Imma drink what I drink, Imma smoke what I smoke 
 If I die from the liver cancer, bitch I joke 
 I'm a real motherfucker till they kill me (Yeah I'm so real, real, real, real) 
 Thou shall never kill, this is how they grill me 
 This is how they gonna feel me, this is how they are awaken 
 And this is that, that awoke, they say ?BB you still smoking?? 
 Course I need some chronic in my system 
 Motherfuckers won't even fucking listen 
 Gotta get them when you get them, you ridding them when you rid them 
 If you listen then you listen if not what the fuck 
 Chorus: Chris Notez (Bizzy Bone) 
 To heal (I'm a real motherfucker till they kill me) 
 I?ma blaze the weed, hit the drink 
 Baby that's just me (I'm a real motherfucker till they kill me) 
 Yeah I'm so real, real, real, real 
 (x2) 
 Outro: Bizzy Bone 
 One time for their motherfucking mind, most motherfucking definitely 
 Motherfuckers can't even come up in this motherfucking garden 
 With no shit, flat out get the fuck outta here 
 World wanna know nothing, that's why God put 9 percent of the brain 
 Take out that cerebellum for me mayne 
 They don't need to know nothing, one time for they mind 
 Be easy on them 'cause
