Coming to you straight from cosmos by the way of Gabriel 
 With the Grim reaper on my shoulders 
 I look into the soul, 
 The spirits are hypnotized 
 And I defy every rule that I know (I know, I know) 
 The devil want me to die 
 And I survive even if I'm in the cold (in the cold, in the cold) 
 Everyone looks like my eyes (like my eyes) 
 I chop up the lamp the sacrifice 
 For my bloodline and then it's on 
 I look into the soul 
 No daddy don't rape me baby, 
 'Cause I was raised in the hood called what the fuck (what the fuck) 
 I left mama cause that's the way we 
 I'm on the move and I groove that's enough 
 I ain't trippin' on none of you 
 But with the thugs I can do anything we want 
 Give me nothing I'll better make something 
 'Cause if the angels don't love you then I bet they love us 
 I gotta get my head up out the way 
 I gotta get my people just past the day 
 The first time when I see you pass away 
 The last time I'm a leave you out of the way 
 Nigga if I don't leave ya now 
 I've been running running 
 I keep running running 
 More than you can believe me now 
 I keep steady steady steady (hey!) 
 I look into the soul, 
 The spirits are hypnotized 
 And I defy every rule that I know (I know, I know) 
 The devil want me to die 
 And I survive even if I'm in the cold (in the cold, in the cold) 
 Everyone looks like my eyes (like my eyes) 
 I chop up the lamp the sacrifice 
 For my bloodline and then it's on 
 I look into the soul 
 Oh daddy no popping no packing 
 'Cause I was praised in the ghetto my body erupt 
 Everybody say get you a gatty 
 Cause you a skinny nigga you gonna need you a gun 
 I get the flippin in fucking them up 
 If Lil Layzie tell me shoot 'em I'm shootin them up 
 One-fity-one and I'm good and drunk 
 Remember the words take him over I'll fuck him up, 
 I gotta get my head just out the way 
 I gotta get my people just past the day 
 The third time I'm a see you walk away 
 The last time I'm a leave you out the way 
 Nigga if you don't leave me now (leave me now) 
 I've been running running 
 I keep steady running 
 And if they don't believe me now 
 Just behead him (behead him, behead him) 
 I look into the soul, 
 The spirits are hypnotized 
 And I defy every rule that I know (I know, I know) 
 The devil want me to die 
 And I survive even if I'm in the cold (in the cold, in the cold) 
 Everyone looks like my eyes (like my eyes) 
 I chop up the lamp the sacrifice 
 For my bloodline and then it's on 
 I look into the soul
