When I first met you babe 
 I said oh my Lord 
 When I first met you baby 
 I said grab your sword 
 I didn't know what to think 
 What's wrong with your mind 
 I didn't know what to say 
 I'm a walk by 
 Cause fuck it I love you 
 Fuck it I need you 
 Said baby I do love you 
 Baby I do need you 
 Well like ion, eon, love and hate 
 I don't want the? that'll be my fate 
 Mama I wanna sing 
 Mama I wanna sing 
 The way that he loves you 
 How can I do, what he does 
 I'm not a fool 
 The way that he thinks 
 The way that he drinks 
 It's all the things that he does it makes me sing 
 I said you deep in love 
 But I can't be your son 
 I can't be the one 
 I can't your gun 
 Well fuck it I love you 
 Fuck it I need you 
 Said baby I do love you 
 Baby I do need you 
 It's like David, Solomon, and the rest up in the bible 
 If I get with this girl then I might go through a trial 
 Or tribulations 
 Ain't no hating 
 My secular speech 
 Has got them waiting 
 I love you 
 She said she hates you 
 She don't hate me 
 Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
 Well fuck it baby I love you 
 Praise God I do need 
 Hmm 
 And baby I do love you 
 Baby I do need you 
 I need, I need, I need (I need, I need) 
 What do, I need 
 What do, I need 
 What's up with those? 
 ? 
 Let me tell you what it is 
 Oh 
 Well fuck it baby I do love you 
 Fuck it baby I do need you 
 I said baby I do love you 
 Baby I do need you 
 Like a spirit need souls
