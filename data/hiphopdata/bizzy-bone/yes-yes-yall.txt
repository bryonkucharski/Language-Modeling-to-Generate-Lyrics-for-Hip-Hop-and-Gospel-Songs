(Verse 1-Bizzy Bone) 
 Now Gary really wants to sue me 
 Stressin out tellin' my groupies set it out 
 I already read it out usually thuggin' in my jacuzzi, with a uzi 
 Wet 'em all... 
 (Chorus-Bizzy Bone) 
 Yes y'all, yes y'all, yes yes yes y'all 
 Tune into the looney and boom 
 I come up out of my room 
 My goons comin' from the resume and doom 
 Yes y'all, yes y'all, yes yes yes y'all 
 (Verse 2-Bizzy Bone) 
 Yes yes get it raw 
 Buck at thre bullet-proof ghetto star 
 With a vest over my chest and there you are 
 (Nigga you flow too fast) Understand me 
 Society got me addicted to the inflicted so synthetic and wicked 
 Call up your family but they dyin' 
 Split up the sticky-sticky Bryon 
 Like grand daddy in the 70's said he just fled and his name was red 
 And I saw my father paralyzed 
 The other was locked down there he cried 
 Won't see me till Buck Rogers dead it was there he died 
 I don't care he lied 
 (Chorus-Bizzy Bone) 
 Yes y'all, yes y'all, yes yes yes y'all 
 Tune into the looney and boom 
 I come up out of my room 
 My goons comin' from the resume and doom 
 Yes y'all, yes y'all, yes yes yes y'all 
 Tune into the looney and boom 
 I come up out of my room 
 My goons comin' from the resume and doom
