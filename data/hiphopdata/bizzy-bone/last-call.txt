Falling falling so fast 
 Satan slithering in grass - there goes his ass 
 I will fight you in dreams 
 Baptized in your feces and angels cover my wings 
 Now I'm ready to roll - now I gotta suit up and I'm ready to go (ready to go) 
 Walk around with a mastermind - I walk blind with a nail in my toe (nail in my toe) 
 I get more than a fist could pull - so as the mountain got a squigly road 
 I light it up like it's the 4th of July - you motherfuckers just don't know 
 Last call for alcohol - we gon' roll now we ready to roll (ready to roll) 
 I drink a little when I'm thinkin' sometimes - I just gotta let my feelings show (ready to fly) 
 'Cause I'm so high I might just mess around and kiss the sky (ready to die) 
 I'm fallen down like I came to the earth - I light you up like the 4th of July - ready to go 
 Are we lawless and crass 
 Jason hither me to class - don't move so fast 
 Keep a life of my steam 
 My size and my meekness my weakness and my dream 
 Now I'm ready to roll - now I gotta suit up and I'm ready to go (ready to go) 
 Walk around with a mastermind - I walk blind with a nail in my toe (nail in my toe) 
 I get more than a fist could pull - so as the mountain got a squigly road 
 I light it up like it's the 4th of July - you motherfuckers just don't know 
 Last call for alcohol - we gon' roll now we ready to roll (ready to roll) 
 I drink a little when I'm thinkin' sometimes - I just gotta let my feelings show (ready to fly) 
 'Cause I'm so high I might just mess around and kiss the sky (ready to die) 
 I'm fallen down like I came to the earth - I light you up like the 4th of July - ready to go 
 Calling calling my dad 
 Seeping slowly and fast - Our balls are brass 
 I will light up and leave 
 Chastise with my species and angels cover my wings 
 Now I'm ready to roll - now I gotta suit up and I'm ready to go (ready to go) 
 Walk around with a mastermind - I walk blind with a nail in my toe (nail in my toe) 
 I get more than a fist could pull - so as the mountain got a squigly road 
 I light it up like it's the 4th of July - you motherfuckers just don't know 
 Last call for alcohol - we gon' roll now we ready to roll (ready to roll) 
 I drink a little when I'm thinkin' sometimes - I just gotta let my feelings show (ready to fly) 
 'Cause I'm so high I might just mess around and kiss the sky (ready to die) 
 I'm fallen down like I came to the earth - I light you up like the 4th of July - ready to go
