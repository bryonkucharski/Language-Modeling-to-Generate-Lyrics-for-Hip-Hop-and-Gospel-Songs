 Hey Mrs. in my business, wannabe publicist huh

 I don't even know ya, can't even speak to ya heart 
 You are just a demon, can't even peep anyone 
 Miss computer hacker, you got no husband to love 
 Talkin' about men and, shit you just need you a hug 
 You 57, tryin' to hang with the young 
 You're the pagan woman, you just a girl in my world 
 Quit callin family, I'm? 
 You botherin my brother, yeah brother Aeileon 
 Aeileon capone so sick of hearin your voice 
 That he puts you on mute and continues to grind with boys 
 Miss computer hacker, and mrs slacker in school ah 
 You, me and your teacher, I'm slappin you with my ruler 
 You can never fool us, and never do us so dumb 
 That we believe in you, you know where we come from, come from 
 I hear you callin, we don't owe you no damn money 
 And all that whole crew I fired was done, 'cause they was phony 
 As we rise again, you can't? 
 It ain't no waltzin in, no matter complainin' or cryin' 
 Baby let me tell ya just exactly where we goin'

 Gotta problem with my brother, don't you fuck with Q Loco 
 Smoke ya out of yo panties, and out of yo hose 
 And choke ya out of yo nooks and yo crannies and even the foes 
 Give 'em the swift blow, bizzy bone is my name 
 Allah, my master, I'm your slave, please keep me safe in this game 
 So as they run and try to sabotage our goal and our aim. 
 Tryna defame and frame, but the real family remains 
 They call me insane?, 
 Assalamulaikum keep them muslims on call 
 You can never fool us, and never do us so dumb 
 That we believe in you, you know where we come from, come from 
 Baby let me tell ya just exactly where we goin' 
 To the top, to to the top, we goin' 
 To the top, to to the top, we goin' 
 To the top, to to the top, we goin' 
 Baby let me tell ya just exactly where we goin' 
 To the top, to to the top, we goin'

 To the top, to to the top, we goin' 
 I can't even belch, now give me health and not welch 
 You don't understand my words cause you need help 
 Hey miss computer hacker, here goin' slow for you 
 So my friends on the internet know that I'm still true 
 Bitch I am so cool 
 Why won't you test me and such 
 And if I was your friend I'd make you love me so much 
 But since I don't want nothin' to do with you 
 You turn to a plot 
 And if you're makin' money 
 It's funny you're tryin' ta stop what I got 
 Punk bitch! bitch! bitch! bitch! 
 Punk bitch! bitch! bitch! bitch!
