(Talking) 
 (Chorus: Bizzy Bone - 2x) 
 We ain't scared, especially if you come up to us 
 And try to bust and when you think we ain't for playa hating 
 We ain't scared, and just because we 
 Serious, mysterious and curious 
 (Lil' Flip) 
 You niggas acting like hoes, wearing eachother clothes 
 Bragging about platinum, nigga that's white gold 
 Fake niggas talk, and real niggas hush 
 Fake niggas run, and real niggas bust 
 Y'all got me fucked up, I been a street nigga 
 And when it's cold outside, I bring my heat nigga 
 Don't beef with me nigga, 'cause I get down and dirty 
 I make a call at one o'clock, you gone by one-thirty 
 Nigga I ain't scared I pack, infrareds 
 My enemies like batteries, half of 'em dead 
 You heard what I said, I'm down with trigga play 
 Cause all you see in convicts and killas, where I stay 
 I know Hump, got my front and Redd, got my back 
 I know Bizzy, got a tech and I'm coming with a mac 
 So start riding your wheel, we coming with the steal 
 And it's a fact, that most niggas mouth get 'em killed 
 (Lil' Flip) 
 I cock and spray, hit you from a block away 
 We ain't scared, believe me we got a lot to say 
 And if you see me in the club with a smile on my face 
 That don't mean shit 'cause I got a nine on my waist 
 So you can play Superman and get your ass paralyzed 
 'Cause when it comes to my guns, they all super-sized 
 You better recognize we ain't Sucka Free for nothing 
 So when I say I'ma get you, you know I ain't bluffing 
 Cause niggas turn into hoes when you pull a gun out 
 And if I pull a gun out, I'm trying to knock a lung off 
 Now who the boss, nigga you already know 
 I got a team of headbusters, where ever I go 
 And if you got beef let me know I'm ready for war 
 I got a semi-automatic that'll machete your car 
 And next time you talk down, I'ma teach you a lesson 
 So call mama, and tell her she gone need her a reverend, what 
 (Bizzy Bone) 
 Papi cholo, cops sniffing co-co, my deadly remedies 
 Like hot topics, hit that body look like frishchami 
 And that Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, telling everybody 
 Hit the floor, so what in the fuck you think I came here for 
 Warrior, ain't no other character, for the love of money yeah 
 When I'm down in Houston, Texas niggas are gut playas 
 Some of these niggas is dinosaurs abducted like flying saucers 
 Niggas don't think like that, lick it down, on my alters 
 The most of my grave suite, model mama, put 'em up now 
 Daddy use to beat you deeply I stay on my tech with die-yah 
 Tupac to Bob Marely, my six the holley Halle Berry touching my braids 
 They ain't giving justice's name killing 'em black bald and all 
 Game recognize game, fame recognize fame 
 Niggas they hang, niggas they bang, niggas they slang 
 Pick up your Mac 10 quickly and bring the pain 
 One in the brain, one in the body it's an everyday thang 
 (Talking)
