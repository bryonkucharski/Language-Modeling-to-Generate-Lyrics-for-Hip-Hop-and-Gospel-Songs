I got more game than nintendo. I'm super cold 
 I keep these bitches hangin' on my colthes. Let 'em know 
 It ain't a thang to swang in da club and get it crunk 
 And you can meet me in da front like what, I pop da trunk 
 But I can't stay I gotta go 
 Because da police on the way a nigga know 
 You better roll outta they way 'n' pull out slow 
 Leave da spot with a bang of a .44 
 Now you know I smoke that potent dro. My purple cold 
 And you can get it from my ? Joe. That's by th Zone 
 Yo nose is open when I let it blow. Call up my chick 
 And toss da bag and baby you roll you can roll 
 Hey you can smoke that's is you move out da way. And watch ya tone 
 Stay on da low and wear da k n coke? 
 Too bad my probations today. I gotta go gotta go 
 I got more game than nintendo 
 Got sticky icky in my dickie clothes. Hand on da stove 
 And don't nobody tell me anymore. Just let me go 
 It ain't a thang when we hit da floor. My niggas know 
 Me wild insane see my '64. Open da door 
 W my vehicle call up my killas from da way 
 And you can 
 My nigga call him 
 And now you know I keep da sickest flow. Gun in my pocket 
 You can catch me at da liquor store. Right next to rocket 
 Where my money hustle hungry ah put down da buddy 
 Let's go
