(Bizzy Bone) 
 Let it go (Let this angel life go) 
 Let yourself go 
 (Time is passin' till the cops come) 
 Big beef, big beefin' with the Mistress 
 (On and on and on and on and on and on and) 
 Over the backs of the lines as we growl, mutherfucker 
 We are livin' in the last motherfuckin' days 
 This is Revelations 
 If it don't go down now 
 That mean aye'body was wrong 
 Can you face yourself with that question? 
 Or the answer? What the fuck do you believe in? 
 Say goodbye to the bad guy 
 'Zy rollin' with my cateye, deadeye 
 Ain't afraid to flame a rat up 
 But I hot out fathom 
 My album hit the shelves 
 We hustle for record sales 
 Hit my liquor store 
 Let my niggas learn about in jail 
 Till the squad cars accel', it's to my position as we yell 
 This here's some bullshit like pit bulls in the bull pen 
 Make that a fine, no 
 If you don't like my bullets, to hell if he ain't fashion 
 L.A. looters, throw your mask on 
 Gambini got his mash on and now we gonna be blastin' 
 (Puffy) 
 I'm married to the game and every year's the same 
 Bullets rain all season 
 Heaven and Hell is only what you believe in 
 Empty the shells if niggas give you the reason 
 Never was the type to be stuck and duckin' and weavin 
 By the grievin' 
 My story's no fairy tale, reach niggas in every cell 
 From my block to the world, gave the glock to my girl 
 Don't mix the kids with the biz' 
 Baby, the industry's hell worth it 
 1 - Oh, I said, oh yeah 
 When they come to lock you down 
 (Don't let it come our way) 
 Oh I said, oh yeah 
 When they come to lock you down 
 (Don't let it come our way) 
 Oh I said, oh yeah 
 When they come to lock you down 
 (Don't let it come our way) 
 Oh I said, oh yeah 
 When they come to lock you down 
 (Don't let it come our way) 
 (Puffy) 
 Look in they grill and get the real 
 'Cause expressions can mean alot 
 Threw my trust in your progress 
 And you guessin' I seen alot 
 The paper got us dressin' and impressin' 
 We spend alot 
 Confessions get us blessings from the Lord 
 We sin a lot 
 Wonder will He let me in? 
 And not constantly tryin' to find a reason why 
 Because I'm a Bad Boy they wanna label me a bad guy 
 Now who am I? 
 (Bizzy Bone) 
 It's P. Diddy muthafucka 
 (Puffy) 
 Do or die? 
 (Bizzy Bone) 
 Don't give a fuck motherfucker 
 Roll through, trust no chicken 
 Tigh kids are tellin' me what's ammunition 
 Buck, buck ammunition baby 
 You let me slow down, the guy that got me's fell down 
 And mami wants to help out 
 So bought the best computer 
 Yes, stress never more 
 Fresh out the foster home 
 If I had a just talked to the psychiatrist 
 Tell her 'bout how she had clothes designers 
 Can she come buy with me? 
 Come ride with me, provide me with a gun 
 Slide the weeded road, come get high with me 
 You don't come weed with me anymore 
 You don't need me anymore 
 Believe me bitch, shit I've slept on the floor 
 Who been left before a black out 
 Tear up the stackhouse 
 Comin' out detention or they always rat (Come on) 
 (Pick it up, ride through) 
 Insidious, hiddious, gritty 'cause she that gets in the club 
 Smack the prettiest in a mini 
 Whittiest beefin' with the mistress 
 Can see they just beatin' up 
 Got even the little kids pickin' up pennies and nickles 
 'Cause they're fallin' in love with his teddy book 
 Give them livin' and pinning a minimum worth a penny 
 (Gotta be spendin') 
 We all earn our dollar till it is the sour element 
 What kinda knowledge is this that I be reapin' 
 Dippin and talking' how it's for money 
 And ending up going back 
 We made like forty one trips 
 Yeah, we want it like that, you know what I bring 
 (Puffy) 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 See what you niggas do to me, I do to you 
 And if I'm who you came to see, then do what you gotta do 
 We can do it anywhere, right here, right there 
 And if you sleep, turn your dream to a nightmare 
 Niggas don't creep, no sleep, feel the heat 
 They lookin' at me funny, fuck a hoe, get this money 
 No time for the misfits niggas, bring your clips 
 War's on my mind 
 Packin' bullets from the mines, mutha fucka's 
 Repeat 1 until fade
