(Evil Laugh) 
 [Evil voice:] Aye you! Tonight is our night, you ready? 
 [Bizzy: hysterical laugh] Crossroads? Ah-ha! 
 This is where Bone should've been... [hysterical laugh] 
 Now I got you screaming oh... 
 When you're down on you're knees 
 Is it joy? Is it love? (not sure on this line) 
 Just simply let yourself go... (go... go...) 
 ? That's what we? 
 I slip into ya 
 Glide yo lips around my rider baby 
 Your fingertips and make this trip 
 I'm a go inside 
 Exotic flexin 
 You ain't text'n me 
 You sext'n me and 
 ? 
 You off the top 
 I'm a go behind 
 Play that fuckin' music 
 Let it automatically rewind 
 Panties drop 
 Slight shave 
 Coochie cleaned 
 I'm a pop 
 Don't stop 
 Won't stop 
 Best believe I can do this... 
 'Cause I'm a rider baby (baby) 
 When I'm inside ya baby (baby) 
 Ya see that fire baby 
 So open up and I'm a ride it all the time... 
 'Cause I'm a rider baby (baby) 
 When I'm inside ya baby (baby) 
 Ya see that fire baby 
 So open up and I could ride it all the time... 
 Now I got you screaming oh... 
 When you're down on you're knees 
 Is it joy? Is it love? (not sure on this line) 
 Just simply let yourself go... (go... go...) 
 ? That's what we ? [x2] 
 Now reasons why ya got me 
 Uno, Dos (not sure on this line) 
 How she got me hot 
 Walk with it... 
 All the way that body body body 
 Just keep it movin' on em 
 Make sure it's satisfying 
 She say she freaky deaky 
 Gotta put men all inside it... 
 Play that fuckin' music 
 Let it automatically rewind 
 Panties drop 
 Slight shave 
 Coochie cleaned 
 I'm a pop 
 Don't stop 
 Won't stop 
 Best believe I can do this... 
 'Cause I'm a rider baby (baby) 
 When I'm inside ya baby (baby) 
 Ya see that fire baby 
 So open up and I'm a ride it all the time...
