(Intro: Bizzy) 
 Yeah, one love, one love 
 Playalitical, is in the mother-kirrt house house house house 
 Bizzy Kid the Midwest Cowboy, is in the mother-kirrt house 
 Is in the mother-kirrt house house, the Kid Bizzy Bone 
 Playalitical, is in the mother-kirrt house house house house 
 (Yeah) 
 (Chorus: Bizzy Bone) 
 And don't you wanna be lovin' us because of what we do 
 How many people in your life you know with us is true 
 For the millennium what we makin', makin' false come true 
 And until the end of days, no matter what you do 
 And don't you wanna be lovin' us because of what we do 
 How many people in your life you know with us is true 
 For the millennium what we makin', makin' false come true 
 And until we end up dead, no matter what you do thugs need love too 
 (Playalitical) 
 Whisper up my wistful ladies look at what this world made us 
 Nine 12's in the club, DJ's yokin on the faders 
 I promoted up my status, now we smokin' on the greatest 
 Clownin with the paper, got a Bose, a house in Vegas 
 I guess I gotta say this, I got no regrets 
 If I could go back in time now I'd go the same steps 
 Look at the Lam' inside the low pro frozen, yes 
 I'm like ugh, really sick off when I'm gruesome, yes 
 We got some catchin up to do, put some ketchup on it 
 Been a long time if you still want it I'ma check up on it 
 I ain't gon' move you to the side, bein honest ain't a challenge 
 Only thing I'm gonna move is the commas on my balance 
 (Bizzy Bone) 
 Cause thugs need love as well, and thugs need love too 
 And thugs need love boo, whoa, whoa, whoa 
 See thugs need love as well, but could you make my heart swell? 
 Get outta my mind before I tell 
 Britney and Alicia, even Brandy, that's my candy girl 
 Now let me welcome you into my little dandy world 
 Me and my man's at the club, he got a girl but I'm single 
 I got the song on and poppin', Bizzy Bone finna mingle 
 Tellin' me I can feel the jingle as the slow jam play 
 And tellin' me I can feel the tingle of this Tangueray 
 Shavelle my belle, how you doin' baby? I'm ridin' 
 Wanna hit it from the back, baby that's perfect timin 
 Side by side, you and I, would you watch my back? 
 I guess the fact of doin' what we doin', see that's that 
 I say now come gimme dat, come gimme dat 
 Come gimme dat, come gimme dat, what what 
 She don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, huh 
 Now come gimme dat, come gimme dat 
 Come gimme dat, come gimme dat, what what 
 If you don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, slut 
 (Chorus - repeat 2X)
