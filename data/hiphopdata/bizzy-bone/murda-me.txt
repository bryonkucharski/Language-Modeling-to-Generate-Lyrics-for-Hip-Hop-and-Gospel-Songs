And the world is so sad... 
 All I want you to do is murder me 
 Murder me, murder me, murder me, murder me 
 Please come murder me 
 In the beginning it was Adam and it was Eve in whom we trusted 
 Oh I believe in don't eat any forbidden fruit oh please don't touch it 
 You think that I want you but no 
 You know I don't 
 And I would not risk my family for fantasy 
 An illusion that moves the man in me, ho 
 Oh, so blowed 
 And don't even think of tempting me w/ ecstacy 
 (Rewind the tape so I can hit it again) 
 Even though we argue I call you the black widow 
 Never will I fall in Indo, throw it out the window 
 (Rewind, Goddammit!) 
 Baby baby baby baby baby 
 Think your body was banging, jim bag, but baby 
 Gotta be crazy 
 All these dope fiend bitches 
 Go get that ass tested 
 And conjour up a name and call all my niggaz you put to rest 
 And Lord bless him 
 But the lord won't bless them

 Black widow, and (Sheeni's?) your pimp, ho 
 Need a little expose, so you... just flip my papers then hey 
 Gotta let them know, bitch you won't rape us, no! 
 Probably smoking stones like your mama 
 And I heard you're sucking dick

 And chicks in common gotta run away 
 Watch you wither and say 
 I told you so, I told you so, I told you 
 Hey, get up out my head

 And the world is so...
