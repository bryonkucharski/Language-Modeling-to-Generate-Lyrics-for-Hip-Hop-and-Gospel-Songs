(Intro: sample of James Brown's "Try Me") 
 Try me (try me) try me (try me, ooh) 
 And your love, will always be true 
 Oh, I need (try me) try me (try me, ooh) 
 God'll tell me... I need you 
 Try me (try me) try me (try me, ooh) 
 And your love, will always be true 
 Oh, I need you 
 (Bizzy Bone:) 
 But you know if I love unconditional 
 This the residual, world individual 
 Indivisible, little old me 
 Keepin' me lonely, no woman to hold me 
 Where my lady? My lady ain't crazy, my love 
 My lady is all that I have 
 Want that below (?), and what do ya know 
 This is the path, so narrow the arrow is pointed 
 At somethin' and I just can't do me 
 It doesn't suit me, just boot me - I'll make it alone 
 I'll make it with Bone, I'm comin' get home 
 Baby I don't accept clothes 
 'Member the tone, the tone, the hollerin is dumb 
 Where is she from? She needs to be gone 
 My word is my bond, your word is your bond 
 Whatever whatever, bring David this song and I'm gone 
 (Chorus: sample of James Brown's "Try Me") 
 Try me (try me) try me (try me, ooh) 
 God'll tell me... I need you 
 Try me (try me) try me (try me, ooh) 
 And your love, will always be true 
 Oh, I need you 
 (Bizzy Bone:) 
 What's she doin', my darling, let's get away fast 
 I give you no money, don't give me no ass 
 We upper-class players, riders forever 
 They never will get us so get us remember 
 Eleven times comin', she's stuntin, she frontin 
 When you ridin' me then ride Ezra, it's nothin' 
 I make him go fuck the flo', you know 
 Mi casa mi casa now watch, that hoe 
 Say boy, that ain't no money, this money is money 
 Johanna, you're so fuckin' hungry, it's funny 
 Messin my body, my ink, back and tummy 
 Be fastenin, can you run it? 
 {"Try me, you can't buy me" - James Brown} 
 Can't fuck with my book baby 
 I read the rook for you baby, ha ha ha 
 (Bizzy Bone:) 
 Tell them quit with that foolish, this schoolin is due 
 Don't mean to be rude, with no attitude 
 Just the gratitude, latitude, gradually after you 
 How could I ever be mad at you? 
 One in their face, with one in their place 
 What should I taste? Give me a woman, I'm straight 
 I said one in yo' face, one in yo' place 
 What should I taste? Give me a woman, I'm straight
