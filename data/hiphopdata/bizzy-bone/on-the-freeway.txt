Bizzy & (Cat Cody) 
 She's ridin' on the highway, highway, highway 
 (She's ridin' on the highway) 
 She's ridin' on the highway, highway, highway 
 (She's ridin' on the highway) 
 She's ridin' on the highway, highway, highway 
 (She's ridin' on the highway) 
 She's ridin' on the highway, highway, highway 
 (Bizzy) 
 Tellin' me to be careful 
 (Cat Cody) 
 Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom 
 (Bizzy) 
 Tellin' me to be careful though so dangerous 
 I say let's change it 
 Put on your coat and call up the chauffeur 
 Oh, gotta leave the babies 
 Face to face it's goin' down 
 Baby lace it with some basement as (just a little) 
 Just a little temptation, and bury it underground 
 And make ya nigga feel famous and say "Hey, fuck the pages" 
 Off to the freeway, anxious to play 
 (Damn) Baby protect my health and yourself and everyone else 
 And lady respect my patience from temptations 
 Let off all that frustration, all is well, hell, what are you waiting for? 
 Basic relations waitin', wakin' up in the storm 
 (Bizzy:8x) 
 Roll with me 
 Roll, can' t you come over? 
 (Cat Cody:2x) 
 Have you ever made love, on the freeway, the freeway? 
 Have you ever met your lover on the highway? Ah, ah, ah, ah 
 (Bizzy) 
 When I put you in my car (zoom, zoom) move far 
 We choose to lose time and, my, why there you are 
 When I saw that night, I had to call 
 It's gotta be right, it couldn't be wrong 
 Lookin' in far fallen and gone, lookin' at the stars, all of them, long 
 And on the freeway, baby believe me, gotta take it easy 
 Yet appeasin' to please 'em 
 Oh, Jesus, she's breathin' on me! 
 But I ain't that weak to put her to sleep 
 So respectful, respect your temple, subliminal 
 Probably pause in the distance, reminisce visual, member my car 
 (Bizzy:12x) 
 Roll with me 
 Roll, can' t you come over? 
 (Cat Cody:2x) 
 Have you ever made love, on the freeway, the freeway? 
 Have you ever met your lover out on the highway? Ah, ah, ah, ah 
 (Bizzy) 
 We're peekin' each other's secrets (Shhh) 
 No speakin', just heavy breathin' 
 (Why don't you take a ride with me? C'mon) 
 (Cat Cody) 
 Friday! 
 (Bizzy) 
 Friday evenin' clear through the weekend we're peakin' each others secrets 
 No speakin', just heavy breathin' 
 A quarter inch from your cleavage 
 The reason you got me 
 Teasin'--be gentle 
 Interested sexual in a room to touch you eventual, too much potential 
 Lookin' at you sensual 
 Let you go, roll, have your space 
 And I'll be paper chasin' up and down, straight ghetto face 
 And have you ever fell in love 
 Just as much that you forgot about everyone just for their touch? 
 (Bizzy:8x) 
 Roll with me 
 Roll, can't you come over? 
 (Cat Cody) 
 Just for that touch 
 Roll, come on and roll with me 
 Stroll, come on and stroll with me 
 Girl, can't you come over? 
 Stroll with me? 
 Yeah, you can 
 Yeah, you can go with me 
 Yeah, I know you can 
 C'mon, yeah you can 
 I know you can 
 Just ride with me
