For the ghetto media 
 Don't let the light skin fool y'all 
 I will fuck you up 
 This is what it sounds like, when thugz cry (3X) 
 This is what it sounds like 
 When thugz cry, when thugz cry 
 This is what it sounds like, when thugz cry (4X) 
 This is what it sounds like 
 When thugz cry, when thugz cry 
 Verse One 
 Nigga we represent the planet get schizophrenic 'n' panic 
 Maybe the past would understand 
 If they'd get off there ass and mannage 
 How do you manage? 
 Paranoid, don't even trust my boyz 
 Watch for the plot and deploy envoys 
 Scopin like a dope fiend 
 But I'm smokin' in the alleyz 
 With these ghetto guns and erase my funds 
 Watts niggas in Cali take bullets to the brain 
 Still rowdy, Jesus really never died 
 You crucified mutual suicide, who am I? 
 Local with vocals going coast to coast 
 Heaven'll move me right fo sho 
 Deception weather my brethren 
 But sunny days when they parlay 
 Get killed when they get to steppin 
 Member the weapon's close 
 And the doctor said 
 I need time to myself on the ocean 
 Those frivolous thoughts 
 But I'm brought up of this independent 
 Caught up sever relentless 
 Evil intentions nobody knows him 
 Even the henchmen, warrior, poet, 
 Never did mention 
 I love my lady rebel 
 We can get this stroke on, we can get this stroke on, 
 And we can get this stroke on, and we can get this stroke on. 
 Verse Two 
 We keepin' the light on at Ruthless and 
 I ain't fuckin' the boss 
 Lookin' at me sexy 
 Take your clothes off 
 But my dick'll go soft! 
 Never mix business with your sickness 
 Enemy see me flipin in the picnic 
 With your lil' divide and conquer 
 But my sister was ready to bomb her! 
 Get off the dizznik and off my voice 
 Me and my boyz 
 Give us a choice 
 How could you ever tell Sony that I was the 
 Only one making noise 
 Ain't it a breech of trust 
 Look in the gutter, unh, never judge yo book 
 By it's cover word to the motherfucka 
 I... I didn't stutter but what if I lost it and 
 Came in the office and nobody noticed 
 With liquid explosive on top of Versace 
 Clothes give up the ghost 
 Krayzie's Picasso, lil' Layzie like Caesar, 
 Stacks like lil' Pesi N Casino and 
 Wish don't give a fuck! O 
 I'm Gambino -n- the walkin' dead 
 Woke up on the wrong side of the bed 
 Bible of survival, Triple six rivals, triple six rivals 
 Member you said I read but rode with 
 Killas, Niggas that'll bust in tha club you don't 
 Feels us strapped in the bed 
 Strapped pickin' up the kids in the realist, 
 The realist, the realist, the realist. 
 Verse Three 
 It'll make your body shake when it's too late soon as 
 You flipped off the safety baby this we all day 
 Don't tell me you crazy 
 Will they sell me? Hell Naw! 
 For the reason this weepin widow be the demon 
 So cheap and at least she go peepin go peep deep 
 Dead in yo pockets no sleep 
 Rollin' with my crucifix Lucifer usually uses 
 The rule of these wicked tricks in the school 
 Of these ghetto games and the fool of this bitch mist 
 I say shame, shame, shame. 
 Enemies attacking me 
 Actually I'm in the grain ask Mr. Majesty 
 These casualties well they're passin me by 
 But I hear death callin when it's so cold in the room 
 Who's stalling better come after me 
 We say fuck y'all 
 All in the battle we, battle we, battle we. 
 When thugz 
 When thugz 
 When thugz 
 When thugz 
 When thugz 
 When thugz 
 When thugz 
 When thugz 
 When the thugz cry
