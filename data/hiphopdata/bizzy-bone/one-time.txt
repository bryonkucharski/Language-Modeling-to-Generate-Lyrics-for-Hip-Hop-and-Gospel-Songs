 Local on the wings takin' flight gettin' mo' major 
 What is it they gonna love me, they gonna shove me 
 Never a stranger to danger playa 
 They better remember that to the coldest winters pimp hand 
 Slippin ain't never an option, I get the trippin' 
 Flip when they dip when they skippin 
 They say to the other side, let it roll, let it go, let me ride 
 As we park on the other side, for the moment 
 And the Lord provides, so potent, heh 
 Like the omni-potent, I'm the greatest, youknowhatI'msayin? 
 Now we duckin in sins, sinful livin', baby let that sinnin begin 
 See ain't we dirty rags, and ain't we dirty bags 
 Pretty in the rugged rough, pretty enough to sip that Henn' 
 Drift back in, move back in, wit 'em again, sick enough 
 Can we bring it quick enough? Now tell me is that slick enough... 
 'Cause I know I wasn't good enough, and I know they sneakin a peek 
 Don't let 'em drown me, oh dear Lord 
 I think they're drunkards and I'm a freak - stay close 
 Look at the cookie crook, but I love them all the same and yes I'm grateful 
 How could they be so fuckin' hateful? (hateful) 
 It's only one - get deep in the word and deep in the herb
