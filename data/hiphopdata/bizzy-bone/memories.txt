 (Come on baby let's rock this shit, come on) 
 Here's a tear for you kiddo, I've cried a river 
 It's been bitter sweet, so complete, I'm still with ya 
 Hear me you know I hear you, I feel you heavenly father 
 Time goes time flows, real water 
 Well baby just shine for me, send a bunch of angels to your rescue 
 (E the elo hinds?) it's him trough the sins 
 Never dismiss you, god is the realest love that I've lorded 
 I came back from a walk like (daddy) u will be known 
 U will be owed to the ozone layer 
 Could you take me to the strip club, my cup, cause baby u a player 
 U tell 'em that I love em, n I need em, let's stick together 
 When hell tries to break the love, say a prayer 
 Making it better 
 In or out of, this is the way that we talk 
 This is the way that we walk 
 Baby war that I got 
 I say we sing for me, do your thing for me 
 Cause Eden is good 
 Well let me take you to my hood, now come into my hood 
 ("This dude on the bus 'n' shit, who was fucking with me 'cause I was young, And you know what I'm saying, Flesh uh, stood his ass up, Flesh is like the person you know what I'm saying, Nigga about 15 years in prison, N he still doing prison time. Flesh sat is ass down, pulled his seat back! poww! On the dude that really is a big motherfucker, dude didn't say a motherfucking thing".) 
 I stroll down memories the light will guide u 
 Honor your mother, honor your father right beside you 
 Hide you never 9-12 September 
 U ain't sucking nothing but a bottle of beer I respect cha 
 Forever, do you know forever? 
 Whenever we leave they might cry, shit baby they better 
 It's cold, I need a sweater, u bold when it's cold 
 And The Story ain't told, confess your sins they owed 
 Anything for the truth, baby raise the roof 
 A little doctor, doctor, breaking 'em off proper 
 Prosper, prosper spot yourself 
 And everybody else 
 Settle for nothing but the best 
 U need some help, just call I'll be right there with you 
 It ain't no fussing or fighting and I won't hit you 
 Huh you need some help, just call, I'll be right there with you 
 It ain't no fussing or no fighting n I won't hit you 
 ("Krayzie Bone, I love that dude 'n' he's always been like my favorite rapper, when we were walking the streets it was just him n I together, we were the only people that would walk when everybody else was in the house, my people said he couldn't stay over there, he didn't want to go to his house, So we walked the streets 'n' we drink Power-Master the entire night, I don't know if you remember that Coltttt-45, so it was a beautiful thing") 
 Lord when I'm walking, I'm knowing that your walking right with me 
 U defend me, n u mend me even when I get tipsy 
 Kinda crazy in the battlefield, still you with me 
 U never tempt me never hurt me 
 I'll be dirty for you, I be pertty for you, I go trough 40 for you 
 I praise Jesus that's the real man, u my boo 
 Brainwave no discussion for gussing 'n' plenty love 
 Lil Bone Thugs N Harmony help from up above 
 It's the test of the flesh, confusion testing my rep 
 So what? that's me, I did it I got the whelps 
 N I weep n I weft 
 N my lips be clef, Now watch yourself, now watch your step 
 Now gimme a hug my love 
 Baby I love you without a question or a doubt in my mind 
 Drink wine, just chill you real less dying 
 Steak, shrimp 'n' lobster 'n' chicken even linguine I can feel you 
 I know that I need you 'n' plus I'm needed
