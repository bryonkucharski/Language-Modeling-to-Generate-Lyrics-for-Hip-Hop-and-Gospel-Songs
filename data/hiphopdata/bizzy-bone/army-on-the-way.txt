 Now here's my cavalry... 
 My supernatural gamma ray to wreck yurr nation 
 Dear Lord show them the way...

 Because I come from Heavens gate... 
 Ain't nothing peculiar about the way that I was raised up... 
 And my army's on the way... 
 And my army love to play... 
 Jump out and pullin' tha pistol 
 Puttin' it on they're temple make 'em speak to ya, speak to ya 
 And my army's on the way 
 Jump out the, jump out the, jump out the hummer lemme speak to ya, speak to ya. 
 Didn't expect that they did it 
 And didn't expect it that they telling they gentlemen 
 Enemies coming in every direction 
 And even the weather was giving them hell 
 And they weeping and wailing 
 And throwing they dust on they heads and the medicine 
 Won't even help em 
 And it's for the welts and the belts of Orion 
 The sediments elements... 
 And my army love to play... 
 Jump out and pullin' tha pistol 
 Puttin' it on they're temple make 'em speak to ya, speak to ya 
 And my army's on the way 
 Jump out the, jump out the, jump out the hummer lemme speak to ya, speak to ya. 
 And my army love to play... 
 Jump out and pullin' tha pistol 
 Puttin' it on they're temple make 'em speak to ya, speak to ya

 We get so high and naked I can cause a planetary telescopic sei... jurr (seizure) 
 We show them the way ta win the war 
 And every world that's if we'll live until to be lead... urrs (leaders) 
 Before we leave we best ta pray 
 And praise the Lord 
 And pass tha ammunition

 And they not playing 
 They come strapped 
 And ready to blaze
