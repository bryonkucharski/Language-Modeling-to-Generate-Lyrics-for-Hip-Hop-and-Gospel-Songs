 Saint? Regerman? early in the morning like a veteran 
 It's the way we do it can't nobody do it better man 
 Afghan children cover up their women and 
 From here to river Jordan you gon' treat 'em like a gentleman 
 Come home, shell shock, we be rebuilding pac ol' block 
 President Obama look at all the purple hots I got 
 Can't stop, won't stop, don't stop, purple block 
 The killer gta be fully aware of why the gunshots 
 Post ups, set up position, trained position 
 30 round of a magazine, M16 
 I been made my decision, God country, God willing 
 The land of the brave, the slaves, we Gods children 
 When I die, I? them flags of a bullet on my nigga 
 Take my packback? and take a swing out off the glass 
 People don't know the half, Allah means Jesus 
 And anybody can ask. 
 So many soldiers standing on the block yeah 
 Trying not to get shot, oh love my thug ways [x2] 
 I'm an American soldier [x2] 
 Just an American soldier 
 I'm an American soldier
