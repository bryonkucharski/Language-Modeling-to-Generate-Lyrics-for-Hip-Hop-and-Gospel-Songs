Out of the slums, in the midst of the darkness 
 And come in, they callin, all in 
 Ready for the mission when they listen 
 Many people, many children 
 Better touch em;deliver the one, better tell em' 
 You can ride to the rhythm, come on 
 And get your gun on, run on, the Benz along 
 Already, Christ to the rhythm for keepin' the boat steady 
 Everybody gather around to protect him 
 The lesson of the spiritual, kick kids and every 
 Everyone is going through their shit, and that's ?? 
 No we not angels, and different for the feelin' 
 Troopin' in the galaxy???? 
 ???? The process, normally 
 Givin' all my money to the poor and the streets keep orderly 
 Sort of like a weapon, we sharin, we still carin' 
 Motherfuckers blessed and in heaven everybody sharin' 
 Some of us try so hard to get attention 
 Nonsense, thinking tellin' me who was winning 
 But the fellas ain't finna forgive all the lies 
 Never the spies wise, and you heard battle cry 
 You'll never see my face or my eyes, no way 
 Headed to a place, nobody don't know my name 
 No lames, no shame, no game, no blame, no mess, no dress, no thanks (let's crush this pain) 
 You'll never see my face or my eyes, no way 
 We headed to a place, nobody don't know my name 
 No game, no lame, no shame, no blame, no mess, no dress, let's crush this pain 
 Now if you still got some gangsta in you, I want you to put your pistol in the air, and let that motherfucker go buck buck buck

 Dear Lord, hit 'em in the head; word written in red 
 Candle lit with the light and the beer 
 Burn it up, try to fight to the death like this 
 Tell 'em what we doing and we moving with their peers 
 Doin' in a ditch 
 Turnin' around, they shit dipin' around, the whip flippin around 
 The kids skippin the rims, and did that with the fish 
 Bizzy and the kizzy, is he coming around, they kick it 
 I know you with it and then we with it to the fullest, to the bullets, to the bullpits 
 Duckin through the bullshit 
 Running the game, and automatic with the torches 
 Trenches, henches, lynches, horses, forces, choices, orchids, Jinns 
 Endorsed with the sword, just normally morbid, fortress, soldiers cordially cautious 
 Fire's are still in that orchid 
 Man, damn, life in the ville, no flim flam 
 Yes the lord has a plan, The lord has a man 
 In us and I trust in him, and he perfect 
 We human, thuggin' and get it, scoopin the ladies out of Hades 
 So it's cool like 80, cursed them, inflection, protection 
 In the section; young gifted and crazy 
 And laetly playin' up these radio stations 
 Twista, X-man, Jimmy, gimme that money 
 Gimme that songs, we thugged out 
 These voice tell in harmony with the symphony 
 Grind and keep inside of the hood, still 
 Mic check, left right, would you? 
 Grand Pappa keeping me safe like... 
 Big Pappa understood the hood

 My father and grandfather so happy to be in existence, alive 
 My understanding the meanings, the reason is like the answer on how to survive 
 How to rewind, make it through affectionately 
 I'm getting as close as I can, as y'all teach me to be a man 
 I stand for something that's more grand 
 The rest of the fam, demonous the winds 
 Abraham, bring some of the Jinns 
 Timothy ????? and all of the candles be pointin to sin 
 I thank the light, creator from darkness, the angel just wanting the love 
 But the love that he has can never be bought, and I thank him and call him a dove 
 Plus he love Allah, and plus the son and I know that he love me as well 
 My name is Glory and Jesus' my dad, even if all of the children fail 
 We'll never fail, better be careful, the mysterys ?? of the holy grail 
 Angels still on your trail, you worship the lord, you'll always prevail 
 Never could teach, I tried to preach, you know what they do to me, want to be righteous 
 Just instead of my stuck in the shelters, I'm kinda famous, singin' it right 
 Grandfather, I'm feelin' I heard the balance the talent like I was told 
 Make me strong from the ?? invisible things Bizzy Bone can't be boned
