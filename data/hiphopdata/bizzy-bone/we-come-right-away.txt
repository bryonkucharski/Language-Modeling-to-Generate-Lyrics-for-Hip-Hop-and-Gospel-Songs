(Intro: Playalitical) 
 Yeah! Hahaha 
 What you didn't believe me? 
 This the year of Illuminated 
 I told you we was gon' shut this shit down 
 (Chorus 2X: Bizzy Bone) 
 You, you, you, you 
 Better call Regime 'cause we come right away, bay-bay 
 (Bizzy Bone) 
 The valley of death, go creep in the shadows 
 And gallop to gallow, the way that we ride 
 Probably thinkin' it's over, the other side 
 Baby divided, go peek at the time 
 Reminded to open the pupil, the blind, look at the duty 
 Don't think that I look at the booty 
 From everything that I was listenin 
 Whippin and tippin the dirty, the mind, uh! 
 Distinguish is somethin' they keep on on tellin' me 
 I don't know nothin' 
 Wanted to conquer the competent, never be pompous 
 Stay dominant, givin' 'em doves and 
 In the name of the Father, the Son 
 And the Holy Spirit, feelin' the love 
 And the beauty is real, beautiful field 
 Remember thou shalt not kill, the brother you're near 
 Whenever you need me I'm never exceeding 
 The beautiful blessings and beautiful lessings 
 I'm never gon' stress, I'm not here to impress 'em 
 And it's plain as steel 
 Look at the metal, the metal, now metal 
 Now let me go grab it before we collide 
 Remember we'll never be hesitant baby 
 Remember the Lord provides, one time! 
 (Outro: Bizzy) 
 You, you, you, you, you, you 
 Shit! Gimme another one, WOO! (echoes) 
 Gimme another one
