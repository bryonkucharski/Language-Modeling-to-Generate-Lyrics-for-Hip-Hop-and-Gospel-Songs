(Intro: Bizzy Bone) 
 We gon' call this song "Trickery and Treachery" 
 And man that's how these motherfuckers do 
 Man we gon' gear up these muh'fuckin' soldiers man 
 Man up, fuck it do what you do 
 (Bizzy Bone:) 
 Tell 'em that it's the trickery, treachery; damn they treacherous 
 This is gettin' biblical baby nobody F'in us 
 Seen a lot of faces, been through so many phases 
 Give me Cristal baby man up, man up, yeah 
 Proud of the mental methodical mind hunter 
 Another game slumber game sleep if you wanna 
 Man up from unknown places when it's simple to be in love 
 Chromosomes broke down wonder is stuck 
 But when enough is enough, and it's tough 
 Throughout the roughest where the red wolves huff and they puff 
 Hey little Bizzy keep they head strong, cry now, can't even cuff 
 You understand it ain't no question, come up 
 What is the purpose of the physical lust? So the barricade can bust 
 Braids shaved ain't no bitches in us, we don't believe in no luck 
 But that's the word game, can't even cuff 
 Ya understand it ain't no question come up, ya understand 
 (Chorus: Bizzy Bone) 
 That's trickery, treachery; damn they treacherous 
 This is gettin' biblical baby nobody F'in us 
 Seen a lot of faces and been through so many phases 
 Give me Cristal baby man up, ya better tell 'em 
 That's trickery, treachery; damn they treacherous 
 This is gettin' biblical baby nobody F'in us 
 Seen a lot of faces and been through so many phases 
 Give me Cristal baby man up 
 (Bizzy Bone:) 
 Back up in the saddle with my homies down in the cattle 
 Black boots, my fatigues and a satchel 
 Keep my eye up on the motherfuckin twos and the sixes 
 Get the fuck in the car, and put ya mind on the one-time bitches 
 You better know who the fuck we are, soldiers now 
 Fuck they try to figure me out, it's my style 
 But I was born with the jewel of a child 
 And it better be women around, I don't give a fuck if she wild 
 Ya fuckin' with me? I tell her quickly bitch sit down, get down 
 You know I'm known to clown around and get around 
 That's the word praise God spirit 
 Shake your motherfuckin stick when the evil get on ya nerves, ya heard? 
 (Chorus x2: Bizzy Bone) 
 That's trickery, treachery; damn they treacherous 
 This is gettin' biblical baby nobody F'in us 
 Seen a lot of faces and been through so many phases 
 Give me Cristal baby man up 
 (Bizzy Bone:) 
 Wanna crawl up out ya spiritual grave, if you a slave 
 To the wicked it's the critical mystical get out the way 
 Bitch, I'm gettin' paid, whatever they say, shake the dust 
 Movin in +Heaven'z Movie+, in God we trust 
 Back to +The Gift+, let's get 'em lifted right now 
 Don't get caught up in the liquid, do da thang my mayne 
 What if I told you this was spiritual, not in yo' brain 
 Spread love baby break that chain 
 Pay attention to the laws, wash yo' drawers by hand if you have to 
 Praise God always all day before and after 
 Then take it to the tabernacle, cleanse that body 
 Learn the happiness and freedom that you felt from ya mommy 
 Heavenly Father they are gigglin, think this is a game 
 Let our words not be in vain; and remember 
 (Chorus: Bizzy Bone) 
 That was trickery, treachery; damn they was treacherous 
 This is gettin' biblical baby nobody F'in us 
 Seen a lot of faces and been through so many phases 
 Give me Cristal baby man up, ya understand 
 That's trickery, treachery; damn they treacherous 
 This is gettin' biblical baby nobody F'in us 
 Seen a lot of faces and been through so many phases 
 Give me Cristal baby man up, ya understand 
 (Outro: Bizzy Bone) 
 Uh, uh, ya understand 
 Ya understand, and we represent the one 
 Yeah, yeah 
 In the name our lord and savior Jesus Christ, yes indeed 
 You know what it is, one true God 
 Yeah, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh...
