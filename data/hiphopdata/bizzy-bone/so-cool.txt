Fresh cornrows, def white gold 
 Silk sheet covers, feather pillows on 
 11'oclock breakfast, cigarette, red bull 
 Open the door, wash my ass and jump in the pool 
 I spark the grill up, season of the fresh fish 
 I give it ten minutes, flip it and go get a dish 
 Brown Kool-aid, I gotta keep it hood 
 And rinse the chlorine off to start the day good 
 Jump into the Lex truck and take the oceanic view 
 Riding the sunset, doing what I wanna do 
 Sit on the hood chillin', watchin' the waves ripple 
 Birds flock in the circles and meet up in the middle 
 I'm still tickled about the struggles of me younger days 
 About my younger age, younger ways, plenty thangs 
 Thoughts vary if you real then it's just respect 
 If you're fake, nobody's even gonna check it 
 I formulate opinions, my Lord create the needs 
 Big pimpin', no OJ Simpson 
 No slackin' in the mackin' 
 Now put that Michael Jackson let the truth resonate in your spirit and keep askin' 
 Ha! 
 I'm so motherfucking cool, nigga 
 So cool I don't sleep, so cool I that don't even smoke weed no mo' 
 It's G, so I floss all alone in the galaxy, guess the devil lost! 
 Ha! 
 I'm so motherfucking cool, nigga 
 So cool I don't sleep, so cool that I don't even smoke weed no mo' 
 It's G, so I floss all alone in the galaxy, guess the devil lost! 
 I make my money legal 
 Now I can preach, dawg 
 And I don't steal nothing, don't reap no benefits 
 And I don't need nothing, don't even need you 
 I am too cold, I cough, without the flu 
 And speaking on my niggas only gonna get you kicked out 
 It ain't a secret neph', let me say what I'm talking about 
 See baby girl a queen, not Venus, Venus is a planet. 
 A leaf, humble and meek 
 I'm not a king but David was so what's the problem? 
 Let the queen chose real niggas, keep mobbin' 
 Abe, my best friend, until the very end 
 He'll play the daddy on the low and we gon' kick it again 
 Imagine never knew and all my nigga blue 
 He'd been fighting you, uh huh, he winning too 
 They called him Rabbi even before I even passed through 
 You can't have anything, share, we gon' make it through 
 I love my feelings all right (you know I gotta get my bling on, bling on, bling on, bling on) 
 A little cuddy all right (you know I gotta put my thing on, thing on, thing on) 
 I'm getting drunk tonight (and maybe have a little fling, little fling, a little fling, a fling 
 And I ain't running no lights (It ain't no need to speed, it ain't no need to speed) 
 Ha! 
 I'm so motherfucking cool, nigga 
 So cool I don't sleep, so cool that I don't even smoke weed no mo'
