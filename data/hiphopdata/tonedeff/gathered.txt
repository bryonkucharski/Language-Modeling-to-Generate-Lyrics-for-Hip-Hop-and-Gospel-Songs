Nothing really seems to matter 
 When you've gone this far 
 Got all my belongings gathered 
 Got my best shoes on 
 Walking on the line 
 Hope you're there with me 
 Following behind 
 Watching intently 
 What you gonna do when no one's 
 There to hear your song 
 And if so, how long until you 
 Think you should move on. 
 Walking on the line 
 No one there to catch me 
 Curious and blind 
 Fear of what I can't see 
 So don't, don't say you want it 
 When you know you don't need it 
 How hard is it to say what's on your mind 
 Don't say you want it 
 When you know you don't need the weight to make it to the other side 
 But are you brave enough to try. 
 Sometimes we think we can fly, with our wings tattered 
 Sometimes we don't think to try, 'cause we don't know any better 
 So, I've gathered myself just to prove 
 To me that I'm not afraid anymore - I am not afraid anymore 
 Of what's around the corner. 
 I am not afraid anymore 
 Nothing really seems to matter 
 When you've gone this far 
 Got all my belongings gathered 
 Got my game face on 
 Walking on the line 
 I know you're here with me 
 Following behind 
 Watching intently 
 So don't, don't say you want it 
 When you know you don't need it 
 How hard is it to say what's on your mind 
 Don't say you want it 
 When you know you don't need the weight to make it to the other side 
 But are you brave enough to try. 
 Sometimes we think we can fly, with our wings tattered 
 Sometimes we don't think to try, 'cause we don't know any better 
 So, I've gathered myself just to prove 
 To me that I'm not afraid anymore. 
 Sometimes, we blink at the moon like we didn't see it coming 
 Sometimes we jump in too soon, from the fear of running. 
 Just when you think that there is nothing in the world 
 To see - Just know there is something around the corner 
 You know there's something around the corner. (Hey) 
 You know, there's something around the corner. 
 But you don't have to be afraid anymore.
