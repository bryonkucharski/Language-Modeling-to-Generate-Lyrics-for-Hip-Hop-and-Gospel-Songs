Lust, once ya feel it in your bones, yo, you know you can't stop it 
 Understand? Let me expand while we're on the topic 
 I date plain Janes, hot chicks 
 But I usually only fuck with female pilots 'cause they got the illest cockpits 
 Ha, and if the crotch fits, wear it 
 I'm the type of Martha Fokker to ditch a bitch the day before I meet the parents 
 She's embarrassed she's dating a rapper - with baggy pants 
 Pick her up from mass, system on blast, grabbing her ass 
 Glad we could smash, but I gotta move on to the next chick 
 I'm an outgoing male, I send one off, and I get one back like Netflix 
 Now get this, when you're sexually reckless, you could have a girl that cooks you breakfast 
 But still seek the rejection of some leggy temptress 
 She's like your petty deathwish 
 You be dressed in your best shit, tryna silence the skeptics 
 Upset kids called her a hoe, and I hoped to god it was true 
 Cause see, a hoe fuck everybody, And a bitch fuck everybody but you 
 I'd forget about it, but soon, I behold it's a sign 
 Envisioned a coked-out Whitney singing "Moment In Time," when I told her I rhymed 
 And fames the best aphrodisiac known to man, cause now we holding hands 
 Saying 'lets blow this stand', and I hate to spoil plans 
 Now that we rolling, I'm the Trojan man, she's stroking it fast 
 I'm jonesing for ass, but I almost choked on the gas when I opened her pants 
 So potent a blast of fish that It was scary, man 
 I snatched the pine tree from the rearview mirror then sandwiched it within her hairy clam. 
 I got pussy, pussy, pussy on my mind and it's killing me 
 2 or 3 at a time, menage a trois or a trilogy 
 I really feel the need to sing this song 
 'Cause I dated a bi-chick for 3 years and I never got my threesome on 
 There's only so many tricks that one woman can teach a schlong 
 And even Cheech and Chong agree, more than one freak sure beats the bong 
 But, I've reached the wall, and yo, I've only failed, 
 Knowing that getting the most available hoes with tail to bone and bail's the holy grail 
 Now for the solo male there isn't the fattest chance in hell 
 You can ask two bad frat chicks to nail without landing your ass in jail 
 And that's the real haphazard deal, when one set of tits ain't enough 
 Ya' want wetter clits, save the hunt, Son, you better just pay to fuck 
 The way my luck is, on whether I'll get or get got 
 Is slim, but if the chance comes, I can't front, I'll give it a shot 
 And I'm shitting you not, the day came when I was put to the test 
 Because of my stage name I met these three hookers looking for sex 
 They claimed Janessa, Brooke and Beth were their governments 
 And they wanted to triple the pleasure, triple the fun like they were doublemint 
 I'm stuttering, I'm looking down at my dick 2 chicks is rubbing it 
 Beth tells me just to look at her tongue and then imagine my cum on it 
 Then, suddenly one of 'em starts crying, some shit 'bout her ex-man 
 And when one chicks in need, the two others WILL ditch the sex plan 
 With staff in hand, I'm asking, "Is it the time for this shit?" 
 From the back of the pack I hear, "Can't you keep your mind off your dick?" 
 This is just another sad song 
 For times like this, when everything's mad wrong 
 You missed your chance, you gotta keep your pants on 
 When things don't go your way. 
 Go your way. 
 It's another assless night 
 When the shorty you're with isn't acting right 
 You're forced to fuck chicks who aren't half as tight 
 When things don't go your way. 
 Go your way.
