V1 
 It is un-fucking-believable, whenever I proceed to besiege beats 
 With a mean streak, lacing tracks phatter than sneakers in Beat Street 
 Seeing to it that each week I've agreed to defeat the weakest of MCs 
 Including G's with Keys, Cheese and Bentley's 
 Guaranteed to receive a high degree of status 
 Due to my steeze using this aparatus, toss rappers like faggots do salads 
 Staggered by the amount of malice that I've managed to average 
 Any MC grabbing this mic after me is needing their hands bandaged 
 Master mechanic, assembling verses 
 I'll be jerking your purse, return with a smirk and a proof of purchase 
 I'm verbally perfect, and I'm assertive when I serve who deserves it 
 Y'all coming up short, you've got smurfs in the circus nervous 
 I've been alerted you've heard this, pounding with crazy shit 
 With a tendency to hurt kids... don't allow me to babysit 
 The compounding's amazing it's slated to change the face of this 
 Restoring the fear of skills in you lyrical atheists. 
 When I rhyme just a little bit, Everybody's feeling it 
 Making sure the rhythm is hitting when I be killing it 
 Really, I make a chicken wanna get with this 
 Baby, say my name, "TONEDEFF", that kid is ridiculous. 
 V2 
 I'm rearranging the game we play with a blazing array of ways 
 To display dismay and decay on the faces of fakes that say 
 They be claiming to turn the page, when they're plainly afraid of change 
 So, like God with a laptop... I'll be saving the day 
 Never the one to disgrace a blank stage or stay in the same place 
 Aiming to lay waste to these snakes that ain't vacating the 48 states 
 And Locating them in the other 2. Making 'em pay 
 Blatantly taking away their weight and then gaining a W 
 And then I be coming through with a nastiness 
 That ain't been seen since your girl came clean, and really revealed just who the daddy is 
 Happiness is rapping and splacking chicks 
 I dominate tricks, and turn pimps into pacifist masochists 
 The most tactical activist and I'm letting the world know 
 These cats is more half-ass than the award show that the Source throws 
 Feats are Herculean like Kevin Sorbo 
 The lyrical Zorro, carving initials into your torso. 
 V3 
 I'm a man on a mission 
 Skills on the mic don't equate to your paper chase or the hate you place in your ammunition 
 It's fact or fiction, I'm acting towards your abolition 
 I'm cracking you ghost just to battle you're fractured apparition 
 Rhythms I map with hand crafted precision 
 No longer will I tolerate these cats that's fraudulent like Darva Conger 
 To be famous for 2 minutes 
 When their whole delivery comes off flatter that a 12-year-old female gymnast 
 They have neither the capacity or the fitness... for instance 
 These cats be thinking they're ill just 'cause they've got syphilis 
 I come prepared with a quickness 
 Their boys could testify nude for them in a courtcase and wouldn't bare witness 
 Competition best to be scared shitless 
 I'll sever their legs and toss a ruler in front of em... see if they go the distance 
 This is readily on my wishlist 
 Like, sticking a chick that be sipping the tip of my dick until she's lipless 
 The gist is it only takes a second to diss ya 
 Bitch, you couldn't match wits if you cloned a twin of Alicia 
 With lesser odds of winning with a militia 
 Blackmailing your bitch, telling her that I'm gonna send you the picture 
 Of me and her playing strip-twister 
 These are the consequences you face when your only aim in the game is to get richer 
 Making intelligence legitimate when I be spitting it 
 You may be hard but you're lyrically impotent 
 And I've been ripping shit since square one 
 Persistence in killing insolence like when women insist to get their hair done 
 I tear the sun out the sky if it's hogging my shine 
 If a track is ill, then it's probably mine.
