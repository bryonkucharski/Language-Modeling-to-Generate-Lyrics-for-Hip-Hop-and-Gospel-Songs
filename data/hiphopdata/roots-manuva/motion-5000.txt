Mickle mingey BPM (?) 
 Slow blends is my friends 
 We transcends till when 
 We grooves with no end 
 Intense like sunrays 
 Scorching down hard 
 Some next types of charge 
 Is at large 
 I sight the Devil 
 In all forms of trait 
 Fusing up the friction 
 Stirring up the hate 
 My Gosh 
 I disagree, I never saw 
 Just a skinwar 
 I see oppressed against oppression 
 But this mode's oppression 
 Is dressed with many guise 
 To sidestep their sights 
 I feel with inner eyes 
 Watch them paro cats, them 
 Now I dictate to friend: 
 Dem a spee, they just don't see that 
 Friction in waiting 
 Be the dislocation 
 In this limb that could be mighty, moving tight 
 I guess I'm a romantic 
 My plan is to defy 
 The nature of an eye 
 That's bent on me and mine 
 Steady flexing with some next type of motion 
 For real 
 It's with some next type of motion 
 Steady flexing with some next type of motion 
 For real 
 It's with some next type of motion 
 I grooves on with the pureness 
 I grace with the breeze 
 Could not give a damn 
 If a damn be to sleaze 
 I be just swinging this heartfelt profound 
 Get getting down 
 Though fools might shun my sound 
 I proceed with procedures well 
 Container in my hand and I'm heading to the well 
 I bring views for the masses to share 
 I fights down greed 'cause there's heaps here to spare 
 But, back in the days 
 I were full of bitterness 
 Seen the next man's gain 
 I was green and full of stress 
 Got to get me mine so I could mangle with my worth 
 If death be the tool, then cats hit the earth 
 Gracious Lord 
 Be feels to shame 
 Proud for the change 
 Now I gets kilogram gain 
 (A basic procedure 
 How I heed ya 
 Alrighty 
 Okay) 
 Steady flexing with some next type of motion 
 For real 
 It's with some next type of motion 
 Steady flexing with some next type of motion 
 Indeed 
 It's with some next type of motion 
 Steady flexing with some next type of motion 
 For real 
 It's with some next type of motion 
 I'm extending my hand to the everyday folk 
 Trying to slip from the grip of a livingdead float 
 The glimmityglam I've got 'nuff of them fooled 
 By the way I open up and prepare to be schooled 
 Trekking through the cesspit 
 I sharps up my wit 
 Numbing to the pressure of an egotrip 
 I'm making slick with mad energy 
 And mad magnitude 
 Wha gwan with snakes (?) 
 I'm yet to be clued (?) 
 What holds me so close to these deep sides of mine 
 Preoccupation with this rootique refine 
 I know not 
 But good God, she eats out my skin 
 The nature of a deep side 
 That lies deep within 
 Ever be sourcing to inspire 
 See me like rain to a wild bushfire 
 Rootique refine 
 Is the spine of my joint 
 Thy heartless have got to catch cuff to the groin 
 Steady flexing with some next type of motion 
 For real 
 It's with some next type of motion 
 Steady flexing with some next type of motion 
 For real 
 It's with some next type of motion 
 Steady flexing with some next type of motion 
 Indeed 
 It's with some next type of motion 
 Steady flexing with some next type of motion 
 For real 
 It's with some next type of motion 
 Steady flexing with some next type of motion 
 For real 
 It's with some next type of motion 
 Steady flexing with some next type of motion 
 For real 
 It's with some next type of motion 
 Steady flexing 
 With some next 
 Types 
 Of motion 
 Know the notion 
 We smooth like baby dancing lotion 
 Oh, God 
 Strings 
 Trill 
 Legato 
 Oh, right 
 Oh, right
