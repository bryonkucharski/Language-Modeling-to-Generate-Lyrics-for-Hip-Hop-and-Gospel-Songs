Well, well, well 
 Well, well 
 Well, well, well 
 Taskmaster burst the bionic zit-splitter 
 Breakneck speed we drown ten pints of bitter 
 We lean all day and some say that ain't productive 
 'Cause that depend upon the demons that you're stuck with 
 'Cause right now, I see clearer than most 
 I sit here contending with this cheese on toast 
 I feel the pain of a third world famine 
 Segue, we count them blessings and keep jamming 
 It's him scumbag, scum of the earth, his worth was nil 
 Until he gained the skill of tongues 
 From fifteen years young straight to my grayback self 
 I stay top shelf material, jerk chicken, jerk fish 
 Breakaway slave, bliss 
 Generate gees and then we stash 'em in the Swiss 
 Fools can't see this, audio pistols 
 A fistful of hip hop banzai, progressing in the flesh 
 Esoteric quotes, most frightening 
 Duppy took a hold of my hand while I was writing 
 Let go me ting, Duppy, let go me hand 
 I summon up the power of banana clan

 Swigging that beetroot juice, now we dipping and boost 
 Set the spirit dem loose, go head go slash up the noose 
 We conclusive proof of both the truth, the right 
 'Cause whether we hitchhike or push bike or travel kind of trash 
 Manifest that with wholesome roots rap, manifest that, yeah 
 I do my same way, ain't nothing else I know 
 Gone up in the life with this here rag-and-bone flow 
 Squeeze the pain from my belly and set my soul free 
 Travel over ocean, land and sea, face nuff stress and difficulty 
 Flung back from the brink, gwan in kinda stink 
 We don't give a frigg about what dem fools think 
 Frigg your network, our debt work a speak for itself 
 Proof of the trophy and the champion belt 
 Come sun, come rain, come hailstone pelt

 Yeah, Bwana Smith with some old time shit 
 Let the whole world know we on some off-key tip 
 Mega-manic when time the pressure start lick 
 By the hook or by the crook, by the poop or by the kick 
 He's sickly cryptic, spitting that code 
 And most proud to present that Cruffiton mode 
 And it shows that they bros done seen a few sleights 
 Life throws scenarios, reality bites 
 We in collision with the beast 
 Lost we religion and we can't get no peace 
 Idiot weak hearts want to take I for chief 
 Stoop to their level and we plotting cold grief 
 But we should know that discipline maketh the gees 
 Separation of the dat from the rap, that's a must 
 Proceed set speed with the Cruffiton touch 
 Proceed set speed, Cruffiton, y'all
