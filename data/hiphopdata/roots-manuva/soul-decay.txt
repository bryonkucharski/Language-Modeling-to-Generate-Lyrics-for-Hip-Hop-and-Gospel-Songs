The dark art 
 Bring the pensive dub 
 The dub is wise 
 Open your eye-dem 
 From nineteen-long time them let loose the crackin' 
 The god that 'nuff praise is Sterling collapse 
 Eyes closed, heads bowed, I hear no prior 
 Proud never sing praise to the pound sign sire 
 Hoping that they read from their pinnacle lessons 
 'Nuff buy scratch cards and gain jack-shit 
 Nothin' ain't fair in love, strife and war 
 Fat cats get fat while the poor stay brass 
 Nothing can gwaan without racketeer 
 Will you live to work or will you work to live? 
 Will you step to the future or dwell on the past? 
 For what be your fight, be it colour or class? 
 Nuff yoot cannot ask this, their tip is me 
 My and I, scammin' on a fat piece of pie 
 And as the greed gets thicker, minds get sicker 
 Bloodthirsty fiends cap cocaine and liquor 
 These streets is thick with bad cliques looking for that raise 
 It don't really matter how these cliques get paid 
 'Cause we're living in the days of ill soul decay 
 Loose it from we body 
 Yippey yah 
 We all got to be something and somebody 
 We all got to find them modes to get love 
 But when that love for the pound starts flooding 
 Every thought behold! Devil disciples, caught and sold 
 Like my man's bouncing weed ounces and everything's nice 
 Then in comes the crackle, it bound to entice: 
 Triple dividends, new-found rank and position 
 But more reason to be cautious, much more to defend 
 Ends is meetin', criss skeets is greetin' 
 Bloods them never dreamed shit could feel so criss 
 While rollin' round the city in a brand-new Benz 
 Feelin' kinda dead 'cause there's cash to collect 
 Ego's on the boost, now that ego needs feed 
 Watch the devil dance, proceed as them lick up the powder 
 Mans start feel like Jesse West 'cause the next plan be to 
 Take out the middleman and make more grand 
 These streets is thick with bad cliques looking for that raise 
 It don't really matter how these cliques get paid 
 'Cause we're living in the days of ill soul decay 
 Loose it from we body 
 Yippey yah

 Yippey yah 
 Them roots are evil, run deep and keep runnin' 
 You sticka with the cunning while the war drums are drummin' 
 If you don't see now, you might never see 
 'Cause the enemy strikes with them sick-type ballistics 
 Sadistic, no error, in the guise of a friend 
 That was tight from way back, chewin' up the fat 
 Talkin' 'bout how we gonna keep stuff true 
 Through the thick through the thin, closer than the skin to flesh 
 But everybody has their price 
 When the beast strikes ain't no tellin' what will happen 
 Just when you were thinkin' you was in the same team 
 You catch the cold frowsy whiff of a snake in your midst 
 Bringin' blitz to your plans when he done shook hands 
 And said he's cool with his cut 
 Now he wants to cut my throat and take the whole lot 
 These streets is thick with bad cliques looking for that raise 
 It don't really matter how these cliques get paid 
 'Cause we're living in the days of ill soul decay 
 Loose it from we body 
 Yippey yah 
 These streets is thick with bad cliques looking for that raise
