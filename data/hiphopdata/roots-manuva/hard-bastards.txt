The pain is in the planning, from the man on the mission 
 Position of the glories got from a basic 
 Sense of overcoming all the hurt and all the setbacks 
 Dirty little sweat backs, things on the neck backs 
 Of them not knowing how stupid it will get 
 A whisper in the street ain't never a secret 
 Nothing is for keeps when you're trying or you're lying 
 Through the second and third hand strands of illusions 
 Fed to the honest hard-working types 
 Who's there willing to take that chance on the mic? 
 To write a little bar and show some regard 
 For the ordinary hero, here and everywhere 
 Busy till we drop debt, machine has truly got them 
 The price ain't always measured in the money 
 Everybody, anybody, wanna be somebody 
 And we all truly are as long as we see through the lies 
 See through the lights and realise the might 
 That just might appear from the most unlikely places 
 Hidden in the sacred space between the thought 
 Hard bars from the hard ass bastards 
 It's not me but I know a few bastards 
 And most broke cunts are all true bastards 
 And most rich cunts are even more bastards 
 Basking in the glory, of getting to the life 
 Life in the fast lane might seem nice 
 Got a little pea's, got a little rice 
 You cross your heart and hope to stay alive 
 You cross your heart and hope to stay alive 
 You may not know 
 When you arrive on that road 
 That will take you 
 Inside of the eye of time 
 You may not know 
 When you arrive on that road 
 That will take you 
 To the inside of the eye of time, the eye of time 
 Things are getting bleak, we ain't seen the worst 
 Kids are having kids, kids that will never work 
 Grandad never worked, daddy never worked now 
 Three generations don't give a shit about work 
 They all got aspirations but nothing they suppose to 
 The TV and the magazine it keeps it kinda hopeful 
 That one day in someway they'll get a lucky break 
 In the meantime that plant food provides a cheap escape 
 The government don't trust them and keeps them all in place 
 With cheap food and cheap booze that keeps them out of shape 
 The underclass, the lowly class with no damn togetherness 
 The union that sold them out and sold them togetherness 
 Will look the other way, as the first becomes the third world 
 There's one world, not three worlds, nothing free in the free market 
 Legitimate targets sitting suffocating for the classless society 
 And the endless enslavement 
 Hard bars from the hard ass bastards 
 It's not me but I know a few bastards 
 And most broke cunts are all true bastards 
 And most rich cunts are even more bastards 
 Basking in the glory, of getting to the life 
 Life in the fast lane might seem nice 
 Got a little pea's, got a little rice 
 You cross your heart and hope to stay alive 
 You cross your heart and hope to stay alive 
 You may not know 
 When you arrive on that road 
 That will take you 
 Inside of the eye of time 
 You may not know 
 When you arrive on that road 
 That will take you 
 To the inside of the eye of time, the eye of time
