Yeah man 
 That's how we groove it's how we sway 
 That's how we sway it's how we groove 
 Contained in a universe 
 Residing in my inner 
 Magnificent view 
 Of cornmeal stew 
 And calaloo 
 Got me wooning on the strongbone 
 Totty we loved them 
 Send them come 
 Roopapiffpum 
 Live wire we runnin' it 
 Shock stun stunning it 
 No pun in it 
 You see crusties drum drumming it 
 Roots of the faith 
 Trace back to year dot 
 We squat up in the ritz 
 Then we rip it down brick by brick 
 'Cause we's a sick sick sick 
 Extension of clique 
 French kissing the chaos 
 In a parallel hell 
 Imploded terror 
 They got my future on DVD 
 Intriguing as it be 
 I don't really wanna see 
 That the kind of su'um 
 That sound strange to me 
 There's chocolate splashed on the floor 
 Look like voodoo 
 Shite somebody splashed me with doodoo 
 Roots mawhoda? Kickin the cack 
 Roots mawhoda? Kickin the cack 
 Zibadoo etc 
 Known to spit roots raps 
 Over stripped down tracks 
 Travel over foreign 
 Get drunk and act slack 
 Wild as fuck 
 While we's living in a pack 
 If it wasn't for this hip hop shit 
 Would I sell crack 
 Can you answer my questions 
 Tell me how black is black 
 Ain't no land in the motherland 
 Be takin' me back 
 With my five GCSEs and one OND 
 Didn't quite make it to university 
 Scratched on for how long 
 Scum of the scum 
 In the belly of the beast 
 Where we fight for crumb 
 We on the psychospiritual 
 Psychophenomenal 
 Transit 
 Speaker of the unsaid shit 
 Just a speck of dust 
 On the tip of god's dick 
 With a dick of my own 
 I zone across the hemisphere 
 Skanking on my toe tip 
 Make my lip shake 
 Levitate 
 As I eat carrot cake 
 Educated in the cycle of life 
 Unicycling on tightropes 
 Much too much for skid valley 
 Look at me 
 Ya wee bonnie lass 
 Decked out in adidas 
 She loves me for me 
 'Cause she got she own cash 
 That's how we groove it's how we sway 
 That's how we sway it's how we groove
