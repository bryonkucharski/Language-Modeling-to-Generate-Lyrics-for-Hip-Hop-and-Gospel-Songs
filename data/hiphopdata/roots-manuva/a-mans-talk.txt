 Man I take man talk for you 
 Man I take man talk for bro 
 Man I take man talk for love 
 But it's true them never know 
 We on some good time, peace talk 
 Holding the fort 
 Recognize the original walk 
 We really can't grudge no man, and yes 
 We really can't judge no man, and yes 
 Divine is the light, divine is the vision 
 Bringing us to those ital decisions 
 Stand up and we shall be counted 
 From where we get to get the good thing mounted 
 Rebel youth with that brick in our hand 
 Fire blazing, ready to burn Baby-land (Babylon) 
 Bringing back a new fertility 
 Change the scene with the rebel virility yes 
 Man I take man talk for you

 Man I take man talk for you 
 Man I take man talk for bro 
 Man I take man talk for love 
 But it's true them never know 
 Kissing my teeth in the face of the non-belief 
 Maneuver deep with swollen feet now keep trotting 
 Do my best to get there, there's no regret here 
 Big things we set here 
 Sufferers, strugglers, in-betweenies 
 Jugglers, hustlers, listen me keenly 
 Define definition of 'self' and go through 
 Divine definition of self. It's on you 
 Full time and get hip to the spirit 
 Full time we do the dip to the spirit 
 Holy ghosting big toast we toasting 
 Making the most and blessedly approaching

 Man are swept, don't pet, man a get it on 
 Man are set, bigger sets, threat will be born 
 If and no buts's nah go gwan klutzy 
 Big heart, brave heart, ever to be gutsy 
 Use initiative, yes you're the pioneer 
 Never stoosh, we're fly gone with Ryanair 
 Sleazy jet now, bargain bucket when 
 We offer you ten to get a little spends
