Try to tell I'm paranoid 
 Try to tell me don't do this 
 Try to tell me I lost my way 
 Try to tell me it's foolish 
 Try to tell me about life itself when none of you people know me 
 But the life I seen been cut short 
 Death don't go so slowly 
 When you're losing life like I lose 
 Ain't no wonder why I'm a user 
 It's no excuse when I keep myself elusive 
 I got good juices 
 To keep myself exclusive 
 Never take it personal when I don't return your call 
 All the peeps in this world want favours 
 And I just can't do them all 
 Damn right that's the life I choose 
 If you're a friend indeed then it won't be news to you 
 (I'm crying for the day) 
 Crying 
 Crying 
 Crying 
 Crying 
 Crying 
 Crying 
 Crying 
 Crying 
 Crying 
 Crying 
 Crying 
 Crying 
 Crying 
 Crying 
 Crying 
 Crying 
 Semi-isolation 
 Trying to come to my senses 
 With a sixth sense that don't make no sense and oh shit that's expensive 
 What I mean what I meant to mean is this world cannot be trusted 
 When I look inside my head and find it so disgusting 
 I speak to myself and my self say: go cause some disruption 
 I'm a rich man, I'm a poor man 
 I can't take no more man 
 My mind's on the floor man 
 I'm a man a man with a strong in my hand 
 Over stand 
 Understand 
 It just might be wrong in my hand 
 Don't belong in my hand till I hand it back 
 Tooled up with a bottle with a handicap 
 Black butt naked with a genital complex 
 Absorbed by getting absorbed by the context 
 I'm crying for the day 
 Crying 
 Crying 
 Crying 
 Crying 
 Crying 
 Crying 
 Crying 
 Crying 
 Crying 
 Crying 
 Crying 
 Crying 
 Crying 
 Crying 
 Crying 
 Crying (crying for the day) 
 You crying? Awe... You're crying
