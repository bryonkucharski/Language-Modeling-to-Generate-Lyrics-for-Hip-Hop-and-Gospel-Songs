Roots Manuva - Thinking 
 I can't see what they want from Smith 
 I am a man of my own mind I'm life in a beat 
 With many of eyes (?), more pony (?) more tits 
 I downed a crook and I act like a twit (?) 
 Could it be that I need some councelling? 
 Could it be no one will amount to him 
 There's too much truth when if I hav' got the urge to sing 
 More soul more sin am reflect within 
 Am an lonely soldier, only with more composure 
 I told ya about my next motion title 
 Some for you to hate, some for you to like 
 Some for you to love, my tears are full of blood 
 Think about you think about me 
 Think about this think about that 
 I am dangerously thinking 
 Thinking about me sitting here thinking 
 Think about you think about me 
 Think about this think about that 
 I am dangerously thinking 
 Thinking about me sitting here thinking 
 Thirty year's old and I never had a job 
 Who's that lay-about professional slob 
 Cooling in my yardy in corner on the club 
 Look me and spread to come squeeze my knob 
 Social crouching big time yob 
 Unintellectual sexual slob 
 All that I have is my balls and my slang 
 I could get dirty and dig for? duties 
 Most unrudy,? to yours truly 
 Roots Manuva remove you're whiteness 
 Lyrical curtness, got enough frauds 
 At home and abroad 
 I'm most on toward 
 Think about you think about me 
 Think about this think about that 
 I am dangerously thinking 
 Thinking about me setting here thinking 
 Think about you think about me 
 Think about this think about that 
 I am dangerously thinking 
 Thinking about me sitting here thinking 
 The scorn grows and it shows in my eyes 
 The truth and the lies, the demon a wise 
 Solution in the sun set and the sun rise 
 Revolution itself the time is nil 
 I'm the hippie I am the gangster the contradiction 
 The plastic dick that needs to be fixed with some good piece of pony 
 To cool my vein, pray for me mummy help me maintain 
 Hip to the poly trip? up in the chain of 
 Crazy commission and those who don't listen 
 And those who don't care and don't who don't fair 
 My god how could it be that the learn come to terms with my misery 
 And still be me and still be free and no?
