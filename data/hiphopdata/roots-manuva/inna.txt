I'm inna 
 There were trendy wannabes staring in my face 
 As I stepped to the place I could taste their glare 
 Tall hair, small hair, nuff shapes of hair 
 Swinging out blabber with the coin to spare 
 Me myself, I only got five quid to spend 
 And once I've broken this note my pockets on a bend 
 Supping on a brew so my vibe gets stirred 
 Feeling kind of brave as my vision is blurred 
 Skeet's in the place, they blow my mind 
 I rehearse my approach and I picks my time 
 Second thoughts at last would distress my night 
 So I was just content with them sight 
 It were me on my Jack Jones, lone getting down 
 Freaking to the sound as the bass bins pound 
 I'm inna 
 Cotching at the bar side, taking in the view 
 Press luck, trying to scrounge me a next pint of brew 
 It's not my relevant spot, see I know nobody 
 So I assume the role of some tender somebody 
 To attract the attention of some cat with some dough 
 Be it Jane or Flo', I'm slick with god flow 
 Looking down at my feet, 'tender' written cross my face 
 Hoping that some skeet aids my case 
 Twenty minutes pass and I gets no joy 
 I brainstormed in a gear for my plan deployed 
 It was a skeet behind the bar, almost dark as me 
 Needed a drink so her dream lover had to be me 
 I said 'Hon, I love the way you work that square 
 I know you's a ten and you got nice hair' 
 I blew she two kisses, two tries and I misses 
 Third time lucky, I'm hitting the target 
 She's warming to my vibe, looking deep into my eyes 
 I'm spewing out lies but she's none the wiser 
 Said 'I can't find my bredren with my twenty pound note 
 I'm feeling kind of hoarse in the throat' 
 She steps to the brew tap, pumps me a brew 
 I said 'Hon, I really don't expect this of you' 
 Pushed the brew to my hand and I grips it tight 
 Turns her back and I slips out of sight 
 I'm inna 
 Back in the midst of them sweaty boogie folk 
 Some cat comes up and tries to sell me some smoke 
 I said 'What you got, weed or hash?' He said 'Hash' 
 I said 'I don't smoke that but I'll take a quick blast' 
 It was a potent cocktail, this hash and brew 
 I flips, acting like I'm not known to do 
 Strips down to my waist, I was feeling hot 
 Getting wild sensations from my head to my... 
 In a drunken stupor, sweating on this skeet 
 The company of us cats, they didn't want to keep 
 Then in came my bartender friend and two bouncers 
 Accusing me of theft, Lord knows I should've left 
 But this buzz in me was like grinning up my jaw 
 Before I knew shite I were flat 'pon the floor 
 Inna, man
