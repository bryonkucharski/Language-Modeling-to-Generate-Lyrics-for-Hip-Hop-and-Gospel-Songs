Ain't nothin but this uncut cruffness I bring 
 Don't care bout no fad I do my own ting 
 Giving chase in this rat race, fears we face 
 And me be on the case, proud plus brave 
 Ready to be taking them drastic measures 
 Get me my treasure then splurt 
 Could not give a brand new blouse and skirt 
 I told you both through, fight through the bleak 
 Clench my teeth dweet, ends often meet 
 By any which method, positivities be we shepherd 
 We pounce like left limb leopard 
 If you ever see me in the street pulling brand new good moves 
 You're wrong to confuse me with regular riff-raff, I got me cause and calling 
 Never have I held any love for stalling 
 Rush and make haste 
 You down for rebellion left-handed cruff we embrace the minellium 
 Ticka-ticka tock my golden pen 
 Scribble 'pon the paper from yassa to when 
 We drop style 'pon the heathens dem 
 Those who can't dig it well I feel the problem 
 Ain't no record that can hold me, I'm oversized 
 Ears ever be open to the words of the wise 
 But there's untold cats on my corner perpetrating 
 Read a few books and now their talking 
 They're looking to convert yours truly, but I'm unruly 
 Plus, for the crew like cooly folk 
 Mixing up the Guinness with the raw egg yolk 
 'Cause it's all about strength while we walk through the valley of the snipe, heathens 
 Get thee from my sight, you cats is ever eager 
 To preach up in my face when you just about scrape to know all that is 
 How the hell you try to tell me coca-cola got fizz? 
 I read your pamphlet four times, It don't make sense 
 You front like you be scholar, Smith smells pretence 
 Yous best get off your horse, drink your milk, get the frig out 
 It goes 
 Ticka-ticka tock my golden pen 
 Scribble 'pon the paper from yassa to when 
 We drop style 'pon the heathens dem 
 Those who can't dig it well I feel the problem 
 What the frig makes you friggers want to frig with this? 
 Now you fools got me living with this mental fist 
 That I wear with knuckledusters, taking out these frogs in their clusters 
 Three by three, five by five 
 How would you describe this left handed loony 
 Toony votoony, dancegate pressure 
 Heading through the back door straight to the bar 
 Then I'm gonna get me some firewater 
 Then I'm gonna scope out a young fine daughter 
 Ah yes, its my wayward nature 
 Hip to a caper, soon to have a house with X amount of acre 
 It goes 
 Ticka-ticka tock my golden pen 
 Scribble 'pon the paper from yassa to when 
 We drop style 'pon the heathens dem 
 Those who can't dig it well I feel the problem 
 Ticka-ticka tock my golden pen 
 Scribble 'pon the paper from yassa to when 
 We drop style 'pon the heathens dem 
 Those who can't dig it well I feel the problem 
 Ticka-ticka tock my golden pen 
 Scribble 'pon the paper from yassa to when 
 We drop style 'pon the heathens dem 
 Those who can't dig it well I feel the problem
