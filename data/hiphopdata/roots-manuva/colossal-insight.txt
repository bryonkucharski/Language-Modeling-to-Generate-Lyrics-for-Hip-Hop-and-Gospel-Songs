Colossal Insight (Colossal, man) 
 Invites the soul (Inviting of the soapbox) 
 Sturdy Off the good foot (More sturdy) 
 Colossal Insight (Colossal!) 
 Invites the soul (Inviting thy soul) 
 Sturdy off the good foot 
 Gracious Lord my mega Almighty 
 I know I been slightly 
 Outta your path 
 Feeling the cold draft 
 Of the bleak winter 
 Splinters in my soul 
 I'm out of control 
 And I know 
 That I should cut down this drinking 
 Too many late nights and wayward thinking 
 Compelling a man to plan to shenanigans 
 The boy in me out I got to be the man again 
 'Cause I didn't rhyme to get me rich 
 But I'm a scally 
 Two twos you'll find I switch 
 Hurt and pain made me 
 Nothing came to save me 
 I walk with disaster 
 Prefer to be plastered 
 Time's my master 
 Don't ask me for Jack Turd 
 All I own is my balls and my word 
 Nobody heard of me 
 'Cause I'm a new man 
 I got this new plan 
 To get these new grands

 People call my name 
 Like it's some kinda game 
 Like I ain't got no fame 
 Like I'm just the same type 
 Shouting out vain lights 
 Move your lurgy 
 I'm far too nervy 
 Observing this world 
 Who the weirdo 
 What the how the 
 Media whores keep shoveling powder 
 It's nothin' to be proud of but stuff goes on 
 Perceptions change 
 Wrong's right and right's wrong 
 Hoop the hoopla-ing 
 Devil keep snarling 
 Buy it buy it sell it sell it 
 More more more 
 This could well be my last LP 
 I've had a good run 
 I've made a few Gs 
 I've had a bag of fun 
 I've smoked a few trees 
 Now I wanna rest my knobbly knees 
 All in all I been feeling the pinch 
 And those bourgeois blacks have been far from convinced 
 But I don't give a damn about UK rap 
 I'm a UK black 
 Making UK tracks 
 And I got love for every one of those scenes 
 And them pigeon-holes were never nothing to hold me
