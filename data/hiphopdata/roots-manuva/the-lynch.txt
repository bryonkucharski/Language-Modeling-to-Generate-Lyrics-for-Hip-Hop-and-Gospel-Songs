Diggin deep into the low budget 
 Halftime 
 We find 
 Diamonds in the rough 
 We rough them up and watch them glisten 
 Yeah 
 Yeahyay 
 Chicken thigh 
 Ya know 
 Chicken thigh 
 My ill piece cosmic commentator 
 Niche innovator 
 Of this hard left 
 Something like a treble cleft 
 Turning over cobble like a back street chef 
 Don't you be mistaken is it odd dub for G 
 Or go get them bricks or we can meet down blackheath 
 Bringing the set, bringing the decks, bringing the plastic 
 We can crash on a one or way 
 Play for play 
 To see who make the crowd bubble 
 It's pure trouble and trauma 
 Weak hearts keep trying their love 
 Sector few we central get rough we get bruised 
 Left them walking open just they string they vest and shoes 
 It was on the choice 
 You chose to come and test 
 Braised all your steaks now ain't jack shite left 
 Now you're in the know you'll be best to head the warning and learn 
 You mess with them pickies and you shall get burnt 
 That's a fact with a 10 grand trap 
 We hang a sound guy 
 We hang him up high 
 Nurse starts fi check 'I'm, an we see the end cry 
 Shoulda never test 
 Shoulda never try 
 Did he na walk on tha 
 I consider why 
 We hang a sound guy 
 We hang him up high 
 Nurse starts fi check 'I'm an we see the end cry 
 Did he not walk on tha 
 I consider why 
 Shoulda never test 
 Shoulda never try 
 Ain't no stigma attached 
 Unashamed 
 That's the proud posse 
 Cruff cycle dudutuff 
 From the cuff 
 The script 
 Ya know that it's conclusive 
 With the response from weak heart we flex 
 Stay abusive 
 We are the original soul g 
 Born to defend that belief with a vigour 
 Carrot juice nigga 
 Born to deliver 
 On type the boogy proof croof 
 From the heart the soul 
 It's not socialite more like socialist 
 Shack up wrack up 
 Raggamatic twist tell me 
 Why the hell you wan fi run up ya gums 
 A criss tings we bring when Manuva come 
 And ain't no blaggin or braggin 
 That stuff work miracles 
 Geez get them tapes and in two weeks they fly like aeroplanes 
 We should be full of ourselves 
 Got these roots fi applies to the science that defines 
 Frontline full time 
 Diggin them trenches I sharpen my senses 
 Sound of war drum 
 For 10 miles around you hear that supersonic off (?) 
 We stamp on weak hearts with size 12 foot 
 We are 
 Bloodthirsty 
 Showing no mercy 
 Needle hits the plate 
 Town boys emigrate 'cause they just can't handle 
 Shame and disgrace 
 Who be those brays trynn'a hold they face 
 Trynn'a hold back the tears 
 Who"s grip ah we fear 
 Beggin for a bly but they dun get ill 
 Contract is written an we gone for the kill 
 Contract is written and we gone 
 We hang a sound guy 
 We hang him up high 
 Nurse starts fi check him and we see the end, cry 
 Did he not walk corner 
 I consider why 
 Shoulda never test 
 Shoulda never try 
 We hang a sound guy 
 We hang him up high 
 Nurse starts fi check him and we see the end, cry 
 Did he not walk corner 
 I consider why 
 Shoulda never test 
 Shoulda never try 
 We hang a sound guy 
 We hang him up high 
 Did he not walk corner 
 I consider why 
 Shoulda never test 
 Shoulda never try 
 Should never test, yeah...
