Lard-a-mercy 
 We drinking snapper 
 'Cause we feeling dirty 
 Oh, Manuva alongside the Wildflower 
 Ah, ha 
 This type of flower y'all 
 Blessings blessings 
 Yessings yessings 
 I'll give you want 
 If you give me what I need 
 Time to say grace 
 Take your place 
 To the human race 
 Yo yo it go 
 Ever am I jamming 
 My flip stay congested 
 Clinically tested 
 Certified pure 
 Gaining more ground than the floor 
 Before you knew shite 
 I kicked down your front door 
 We put drums and b-lines 
 And stain your inner mind 
 Boldly you are struck with this Rootique design 
 See I don't 
 Know no better 
 Than to keep my shit deep 
 Ticking over time till my week end my sleep 
 I shun the ways of all sheep-like types 
 When I grips mics you get pure blessed strength 
 Heaven sent, making heathens repent 
 Push your bad shit back 
 Here comes the baptism 
 Don't key nuff his instant composition (?) 
 And there'll be no backsliding in my church 
 'Cause I hurt like the truth 
 Check my magazine 
 Any which way heathens must get redeemed 
 Before you get the wrong idea 
 Here's something I got to make clear 
 The ex-experts with the expertise 
 Ain't got no place over here 
 Before you get the wrong 
 Start acting wrong strong 
 If you ever catch me dancing on a table top 
 In a thong, in a seedy dive 
 Looking sad like my stuff's gone wrong 
 Yeah, for now I look focussed, diligent, strong 
 Point is to make me warn ya 
 That you never know quite what's around the corner 
 See, if I had the gift of foresight 
 Wishing I could tell you, babe, that it'll be all right 
 But don't forget to live up in the hear and now 
 While you thinking 'bout the year two thou' 
 For the future don't be scared 
 Be prepared to stop chase the chattels and the vanity 
 Get in touch with your soul and spirituality 
 Before the full calamity is here, my dear 
 My fire's still burning like a spear 
 Wildflower, Roots Manuva, make it clear, make it clear 
 We make it blouse not clear 
 Before you get the wrong idea 
 Here's something I got to make clear 
 The ex-experts with the expertise 
 Ain't got no place over here 
 Before you get the wrong idea 
 Here's something I got to make clear 
 The ex-experts with the expertise 
 Ain't got no place over here 
 Over here. Over where? 
 I stay pensive 
 Keep my flex of trashion expensive 
 Dem A&R stay anally retentive 
 You tink how I step fras I just 
 Deal with the matter put my heart pon plate 
 White labels in a suitcase 
 Photocopies of some spiel and my black face 
 I'm on the corner of East Street 
 Yelling, rag and bones style 
 Greet the man's with a spud 
 Greet the skeets with a smile 
 Frig 'em all, here stands the heart, the balls 
 So if you truly sick and tired of the bullshite hype 
 Back a local man and make a stand 
 Sing nah 
 We don't wannabe, we just be 
 We most uncouth, we un-PC 
 Kick the sand in your face 
 The ace is mine 
 Travelcard in my pocket running under the Thames 
 Heading North of the river to collect two ends 
 It go 
 Before you get the wrong idea 
 Here's something I got to make 
 Something I got to 
 Before you get the wrong idea 
 Here's something I got to make clear 
 The ex-experts with the expertise 
 Ain't got no place over here 
 Before you get the wrong idea 
 Here's something I got to make clear 
 The ex-experts with the expertise 
 Ain't got no place over here 
 Over here 
 Before you get the wrong idea 
 Here's something I got to make clear 
 The ex-experts with the expertise 
 Ain't got no place over here
