Fuel injection on a blank page 
 My mental splurges and emerges from nothing 
 I'm the forgotten 
 The nude that got caught with two keys in his bottom 
 We don't know him, we don't owe him 
 Poetic justice with no poem 
 I study my art 'til I'm blue in the face 
 No time to waste, my heart's on the plate 
 The soul and life force dancing on the timelines 
 These ain't rhymes no more, they're straight sermons 
 For urban suburban Babylonian contours 
 Raw roll up raw, sounds of war 
 To drown out the police and their tracking device 
 Brings back to mind how they mack on the ice 
 'Cause they transmit and receive 
 Best know the beast will listen 
 Throw your glitz as they strip your assets 
 How vexed thou art, but you are playing a part 
 In your own damn demise 
 You money-grips need to get more wise 
 Chin high, puffed chest, we step right to it 
 The choice is there ain't no choice but to pursue it 
 Chin high, puffed chest, we step right to it 
 The choice is there ain't no choice but to pursue it 
 Chin high, puffed chest, we step right to it 
 The choice is there ain't no choice but to pursue it 
 Pursue it, pursue it 
 My I-tal views come from this I-tal brew 
 Something about these struggles and the things they do 
 The peace-bringers, quote-key-quote singers 
 That ring us for nothing in this marketplace 
 Could be target grace, a new-tical movement 
 Bringing an improvement to mind and soul 
 Life's a bitch, we tired of the bitching 
 Them cheap escape routes got me here twitching 
 How much money must we waste 'til we see 
 Them self-made heroes that we make for ourself 
 Goodbye old me, say hello to the new 
 Please Lord Jesus, help me get through 
 Can I be a man for my baby boo 
 What's a grown man supposing he to do 
 When the world at large be scared of the truth 
 I got good reason to be uncouth 
 Like a big wide hole in the top of your roof 
 And I really don't got much nice to say 
 When day-to-day is pure bills to pay 
 So how am I supposed to change my ways 
 When this world at large seems to lead me astray 
 Chin high, puffed chest, we step right to it 
 The choice is there ain't no choice but to pursue it 
 Chin high, puffed chest, we step right to it 
 The choice is there ain't no choice but to pursue it 
 Chin high, puffed chest, we step right to it 
 The choice is there ain't no choice but to pursue it 
 Pursue it, pursue it 
 Transfixed by an apparent 
 Will in the way 
 To seize the day 
 Accept us to social fray 
 Most remember what the media push 
 There goes the crooks who fiddle the books 
 And run scot-free 'cause money reigns supreme 
 In the gene of the fiends 
 Chemical warfare 
 Biological warfare 
 The near is never seen 
 Man and machine 
 Getting into things 
 While some claim road and some claim blame 
 Oblivious to the time that we're living in 
 The misled mislead 
 Afflicted by the greed 
 Government man keep fighting down the weed 
 While they boost up the booze, the prozac and methodone 
 And use the taxpayer's money to develop their clones 
 Misinformation 
 Mass sedation 
 Nations baited for spiritual rapings 
 Chin high, puffed chest, we step right to it 
 The choice is there ain't no choice but to pursue it 
 Chin high, puffed chest, we step right to it 
 The choice is there ain't no choice but to pursue it 
 Chin high, puffed chest, we step right to it 
 The choice is there ain't no choice but to pursue it 
 Pursue it, pursue it...
