Uuh-uh, sometimes 
 It feels like fighting for 
 Wasting away fighting for 
 Uuh-uh, sometimes 
 When it feels like fighting for 
 Wasting away fighting for 
 Should'a been could'a been ain't so why bother with 
 No time to tolerate the constants of horridness 
 Dressed as a friend as nice as they come 
 Knives shall be plunged deep into the flesh 
 Of them that were happy to least expect it 
 Blood may well be thicker than water 
 But war will arrive with no word of warning 
 Angels of the morning, demons in the noon 
 Ever consumed by beating off the gloom 
 There in the moment, faced with the truth 
 Just ain't gonna know what's the right thing to do 
 The life of the little, the life of the great deal 
 Life taking life, death making space for life 
 Vein fights of, vein flights of 
 Hands are tied, sick and damn tired 
 The cold truth makes room for the warm lies 
 Uuh-uh, sometimes 
 It feels like fighting for 
 Wasting away fighting for 
 Uuh-uh, sometimes 
 When it feels like fighting for 
 Wasting away fighting for 
 Choosing the right, battle recognising the foe 
 At the end of the road that leads to a road from 
 Out of the blows, no news is bad news 
 Accustomed to assume in the payments of dues 
 From right where you stand, that brings out the upper hand 
 Peace makes the man, but the ego runs riot 
 Step into the light, remaining in the darkness 
 Fortune lanes pertaining to the heartless 
 It may seem like a viable option 
 Fire against fire is a strange concoction 
 Karmic justice will reign supreme 
 Routines in life cause a loss of belief, we're 
 Regaining that, reframing that 
 New name for that, new lane to bat 
 Greater steps for all creed and kind 
 With movements of this Devine decide it's 
 Uuh-uh, sometimes (It's those moments) 
 It feels like fighting for 
 Wasting away fighting for 
 Uuh-uh, sometimes (when we open our eyes and recognize) 
 When it feels like fighting for 
 Wasting away fighting for
