Lord Gosh now 
 Rebel eye with fortitude 
 Come see the dude exude 
 The rudiment cement baptism 
 No arguments 'cause I know the blokes who terminate 
 They do it for the joy they don't need no papes 
 While I count the shillings 
 Best know there's many willing 
 To drill out the laws till the nonsense pauses 
 Down for the essence of rebel-eye causes 
 With synchronisity, goat-skin paraphrase 
 Mystic maze of sonic mathematics 
 The acrobatics on a tightrope 
 That near broke the spine 
 Time for time, line for line 
 Random as the windchime 
 Deep sublime 
 Risen above 
 Written in dub 
 Dubwise 
 Pomme-frites or French fries 
 International passion of whom? 
 New life in the womb 
 Have you ever known a haunting of this kind? 
 From to and fro, the railroad of one's mind 
 Have you ever known a haunting of this kind? 
 From to and fro, the railroad of one's mind 
 When I hold my pen 
 Done told my pen 
 Talk the talk of the lion's den 
 Come again 
 Come see me, in the clouds 
 Singing it loud, saying it proud 
 This title survival go back back the Bible 
 With some old thing, new thing, a you-and-a-who? thing 
 You don't want none 
 But you might get it 
 Jump right down and watch the man who met it 
 Holy thing, slowly hymn from thingamy 
 Don't you start kidding me 
 We'se deadly serious 
 Nobody want to share with us 
 Have you ever known a haunting of this kind? 
 From to and fro, the railroad of one's mind 
 Have you ever known a haunting of this kind? 
 From to and fro, the railroad of one's mind 
 I'm lost 
 I'm lost 
 In the stream of so-called 
 Consciousness 
 The random thought 
 The random splurge 
 That upsurges through the centre 
 Of the mind's inner page 
 The rage inside 
 The rage inside 
 The stage inside 
 The eye of the tigger 
 That turns to tiger
