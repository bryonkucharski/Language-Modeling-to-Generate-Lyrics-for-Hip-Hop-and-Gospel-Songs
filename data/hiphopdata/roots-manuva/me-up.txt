She opened me up 
 She opened me up 
 She hold me like some weed now she smoking me whole 
 She opened me up 
 She opened me up 
 She hold me like some weed now she smoking me whole 
 Started from a simple task, started from a simple word 
 Could have never learned a simple task, wasn't made for such a her her 
 Lost in the daily haze of so so 
 Closure to able feelings 
 Suddenly truly supposed to not to 
 Be sucked away by all these feelings 
 Feelings up in the feelings so right inside incite connect to my side off 
 Vibration here, sanctified inclination so clearly 
 Didn't want to hear me nearly gave in 
 Ego games they claimed to cave in 
 Peoples bout to say the same thing 
 Ain't nothing in this world that came to save him 
 But wine and soul and spirit with the freeness 
 Can't get between us just can't redeem this here's where to feel this proper whole 
 Chemistry will come and take it so 
 Nothing in this universe is on hold so 
 Whatever we do for love 
 Bouncing groove we do for love 
 Bouncing groove it's sprucing up 
 She opened me up 
 She opened me up 
 She hold me like some weed now she smoking me whole 
 She opened me up 
 She opened me up 
 She hold me like some weed now she smoking me whole 
 More ground over standing it, understanding here and they're tying them off 
 More to get with the basic joy for 
 The simple things that come to pass 
 8 billion chances in the process 
 Lost focus pulling the point of view 
 Great learning seems to point to whom 
 Who knows it fills a place to dance 
 Up against it ready to take the jump 
 The final pilot comes from out the blue 
 No surprises hearing it all to do 
 All but seize the power of the moment 
 Keep holding on to the atonement 
 Condolence for the afterlife 
 Four sense known as half a life 
 Do you want to live for a thousand years 
 Thought I found my exit, but found my faith again 
 Face to face with the sacred hearing the space again 
 I found that space again 
 Thought I found my exit, but found my faith again 
 Face to face with the sacred hearing the space again 
 Here in the space 
 She opened me up 
 She opened me up 
 She hold me like some weed now she smoking me whole 
 She opened me up 
 She opened me up 
 She hold me like some weed now she smoking me whole 
 Thought I found my exit, but found my faith again
