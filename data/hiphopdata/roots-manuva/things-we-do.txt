Things we do 
 Let's pretend that we'll be here tomorrow 
 And I'll try for you to be a little more on time 
 I know you need to say you know you've let me down 
 But you haven't and it's hard to talk with people all around 
 Please don't say how proud you are 
 Let's do the things we normally do 
 I'll say see you later, you'll sing a line or two 
 From your rebel songs sung out of tune 
 Don't hold my hand for longer than you need to 
 Let's forget that we're here and make some plans 
 We'll go for walks sit on the bench we always sat 
 I'll tell you every little detail of my day and so will you 
 Don't try to stay awake, I'm feeling tired too 
 This is just another day 
 Let's do the things we normally do 
 I'll say see you later you'll sing a line or two 
 From your rebel songs sung out of tune 
 Don't hold my hand for longer than you need to 
 Armored cars and tanks 
 And guns came to take away our sons 
 And everybody's stood behind 
 The man behind the wire there's a fight to love 
 A fight to have your bed's a battlefield and back 
 And all of this will just be stripped away 
 Let's do the things we normally do 
 I'll say see you later you'll sing a line or two 
 From your rebel songs sung out of tune 
 Don't hold my hand for longer than you need to 
 Don't look me in the eye more than you need to 
 Don't try to say goodbye if I don't want to 
 Don't say how proud you are 
 And say I'm far away and take along your 
 And say a word and I can say fade away
