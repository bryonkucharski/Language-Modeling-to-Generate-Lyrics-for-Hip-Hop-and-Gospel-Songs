By any means necessary 
 We do the necessary 
 Cause what is necessary 
 Is necessary 
 My sweet only monster face 
 Your life 
 ? 
 I know your face 
 Crash landing no man standing 
 Can't believe what I just put my hand in 
 A little blood a little brain a little how come 
 No seat belt How to be how dumb 
 Fantastic speeds on the runway 
 Wrong place wrong time in a long way 
 Can't breath can't see mind groggy 
 Last memory seems so jolly 
 Split seconds compress my lifetime 
 Men and machine hand me a lifeline 
 I don't want these machines in my blood stream 
 Pure steel now I;m floating through my blood stream 
 Out for the count coma to coma 
 Alien amongst my own persona 
 The tracking device of real heavy metal types 
 The tracking device of real heavy metal life 
 Please help me 
 Oh no 
 Oh no no 
 A paranoid place is not a real place 
 But who's to say when the words won't say 
 Emotional tipping points 
 The sticking points in a one way path 
 Don't look back forward march 
 It starts to end that ends the start of it 
 Lucid playing a page and a part 
 A stain on a heart a strain on afar 
 Flashing back to me not quite actually 
 Why in the world would a logic be merciful 
 Worst of all we sit here nothing appears or appears to win 
 The teaching here in an empty hand 
 The void in the space in an empty plan 
 Altogether from no man wants to be stuck in the sweetness the love of the monster breathes 
 My sweet only monster face 
 Your life 
 ? 
 I know your face 
 Please help me 
 Please help me 
 Oh no 
 Oh no no 
 Crash landing 
 Papers handing me 
 Still alive it just seems impossible 
 To see them chop and cut my body 
 Out of body and I see many bodies 
 Kinda feels like time has frozen 
 The cousin of death don't seem so 
 Sweet poison calling me closer 
 The gift and the curse the choose's onus 
 My sweet only monster face 
 Your life 
 ? 
 I know your face 
 My sweet only monster face 
 Your life 
 ? 
 I know your face
