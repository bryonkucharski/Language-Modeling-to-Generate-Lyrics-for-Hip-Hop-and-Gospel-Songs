 A lot of people don't know about Smith 
 How I came to the scene, and came to uplift! 
 Eradicatory sanctions of righteousness 
 Pentecostal son, coming from the heartlands 
 With every breath and every noun 
 We dare not stop burning Babylon down 
 With every penny, every pound 
 Reflective of the rebel heart and the rebel sound 
 Dedication to dem life and dem causes 
 I did dem tours and settled those scores now 
 I'm back at the drawing board 
 And I'm sketching out two plans with two crystal balls 
 I see the future and the culture looks corroded 
 Lose that chap, man. But them dudes are just posers 
 I don't know where to show this 
 So I'm about to bring that back 
 Whether we chant, rap or sing that back 
 It go 
 Again and again and again, we come fi improve ya 
 (Oh, hear we, oh hear we) 
 Again and again and again, we bust a big groove Manuva 
 (Lord) 
 Again and again and again, we come fi improve ya 
 (Oh, hear we, oh hear we) 
 Again and again and again, we bust a big groove Manuva 
 (Lord) 
 Anytime we chant that ting, you know we rap that ting! 
 We just might clap that ting, but 
 We ain't on some boasting about 
 We gotta make moves, no loafing about! 
 He ain't got no clout, she ain't got no clout 
 Still they wanna come here, come run up their mouth! 
 They wanna know what Manuva's about: 
 Check my catalogue, you'll see with no doubt! 
 We don't sell out, but we sell a tune or two 
 Beaten by a wooden spoon or two 
 But the pain that break me is the pain that make me 
 And the pain that take me is the pain that help me maintain 
 Life ting in the frame you know 
 We're straight kicking the bin - it go 
 I don't know where the soul is 
 So I'm about to bring that back 
 Whether we chant, rap or sing that back 
 It go 
 Again and again and again, we come fi improve ya 
 (Oh, hear we, oh hear we) 
 Again and again and again, we bust a big groove Manuva 
 (Lord) 
 Again and again and again, we come fi improve ya 
 (Oh, hear we, oh hear we) 
 Again and again and again, we bust a big groove Manuva 
 (Lord)

 Oh, yes, Roots Manuva, the talk of the town 
 So watch all the people ?sending come fi yuh the run?

 Roots Manuva is the star of the show 
 You know-oh 
 Again and again and again, we come fi improve ya

 Again and again and again, we bust a big groove Manuva
