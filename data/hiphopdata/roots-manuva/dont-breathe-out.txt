The R-O-D gets deep on it's something is awful as thoughtful as pain on the button it's 
 Full of that self discovery 
 Can't discover me cause the lord governs me 
 I know they don't like the world but I shall observe and I shall do service 
 Here in the pulpit to duck po po 
 ? 
 nose and the twitch is low 
 Get to the black let's get to the facts 
 The poor don't relax the poor do funky soul clap 
 Twisting and dap with them 
 Turn the G's it's black cause 
 We believe it's that way 
 Full of that no me spirit 
 Can't control me spirit 
 Can't console me spirit 
 Get to know me spirit 
 Get to grow me spirit now 
 We're the fallen 
 Don't breathe out 
 I know you will 
 Don't breathe out 
 I know you will 
 Don't breathe out 
 No fear put it out there prepare for who unaware for the stabbed and the tearful 
 Me and the tearful, ever so careful 
 Full of the fiending revealed in the lake is hot heath 
 Cleavage knock out, knocking it out you know 
 Hide the salami, dropping it out 
 No go, keep flopping it out 
 Keep thinking of a master plan 
 Do for must and sure I can 
 Shall expand with the brand of the anti-brand 
 The nobody likes us, the true survivors 
 Only in spite of 
 Being the most misunderstood 
 Run the good bad and ugly 
 We keep it cuddly 
 Stating the 
 ? 
 Pulling the rugby 
 Cannot mug me 
 Can't out-plug me 
 We're the fallen 
 Don't breathe out 
 I know you will 
 Don't breathe out 
 I know you will 
 Don't breathe out 
 All forgiven and I thank you Lord 
 Never to late to thank you Lord 
 Full force and a blanket for 
 Hold a dream and be some more 
 Can't escape universal law 
 First in line for the cause and call 
 Bound to make one walk one tour 
 Lose to win and take the fall 
 Keep a hold of the golden breath 
 Fear for nothing in life or death 
 Seen the scene in the pearly gates 
 New black Jesus we can't wait 
 Kiss myself and kiss the ground 
 Feeling most uplifted now 
 Me and my God need the purest love 
 Known to be about what pureness does 
 We're the fallen 
 Don't breathe out 
 (Hold it) 
 I know you will 
 (Dancing on the flame 
 Don't breathe out 
 I know you will 
 (How brave is your breath?) 
 Don't breathe out 
 (Oh yeah baby it's too easy to take the now for granted) 
 I know you will 
 (We walk with the impossible) 
 Don't breathe out
