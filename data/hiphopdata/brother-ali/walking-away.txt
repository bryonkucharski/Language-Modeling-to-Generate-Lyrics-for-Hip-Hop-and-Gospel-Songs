I'm gonna go ahead and wager that you'll never listen to another song of mine. 
 I can't say I blame you, either, 'cause if you made records, you ain't going to catch me listening to that shit. 
 But if you do, I just want you to know I didn't make this to hurt you, god knows you done hurt enough. 
 Just... I don't know, trying to make some real shit, you know. 
 Bye 
 You ain't never going to see me again if I can help it 
 Little felon take it easy 
 Fresh out of forced tears, kisses, and hugs 
 You about to lose the company your misery loves 
 Ain't never did nothing but try to cure your disease 
 At least help the symptoms, 'stead you infected me 
 I'm not the kind of man to draw a line in the sand 
 If you've got to draw at all then it's time for you to scram 
 P.S. you can keep all this shit 
 And hang around your broke friends and call yourself rich 
 Struggling I did with you was all for nothing 
 It was never enough, your heart set on suffering 
 I admit that I was weak in the beginning 
 I wanted someone to need me instead of a friendship 
 I didn't think I deserved a true partner 
 So I transferred the arrangement I had with my momma 
 Since you never listened to a word I ever said 
 Maybe seeing this door slam will get it through you head 
 I don't love you; I don't think I ever did 
 And if you hadn't tried to kill me, I'd have stayed for the kid 
 (x2) 
 There's nothing more for us to say 
 Got my mind made up, I'm walking away 
 Sometimes we just outgrow the role that we play 
 Hope you find a happy ending to your story someday 
 Round and round and round we used to go 
 I never fucked you right or made enough bread, I know 
 If I'm such a bastard and mistreated you so 
 Then how is it you're losing your mind to see me go? 
 Truth be told, I held you together 
 For all them years and I cheated on you never 
 Defended your honor, took in your momma 
 When she tried to rehab and had your back through the drama 
 You've got a sick stone under your ribs 
 Where a heart is supposed to live 
 Sick twisted and vindictive with your windows dim 
 Baby in that wicked hardboiled fist you must shiver 
 How you threaten to kill the most precious 
 Gift that you'll ever be blessed with 
 Unless you're twisted, demented, and depressed as shit 
 And alone 'cause you faithfully slayed your friendships 
 Since you never listened to a word I ever said 
 Maybe seeing this door slam will get it through your head 
 You don't love me; I don't think you ever did 
 And if you hadn't tried to kill me I'd have stayed for the kid 
 (x2) 
 There's nothing more for us to say 
 Got my mind made up, I'm walking away 
 Sometimes we just outgrow the role that we play 
 Hope you find a happy ending to your story someday
