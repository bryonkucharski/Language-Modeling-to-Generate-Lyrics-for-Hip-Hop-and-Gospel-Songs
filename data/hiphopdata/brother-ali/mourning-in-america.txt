I don't usually use those big words 
 'Cause I don't usually deal with big people 
 I find you can get a whole lot of small people 
 And whip hell out of a whole lot of big people 
 Murder murder murder kill kill kill 
 Cannibals walk the earth and get I'll blood spill 
 Eyes sunk deep in their skull their bone chill 
 Few for survival most for the thrill 
 Terrorism is the war of the poor 
 Hold up a mirror so the script get flipped 
 'Cause when it's in reverse it ain't wrong no more 
 Warfare's the terrorism of the rich 
 Who's the true guerilla 
 When the bomb on your body killing innocent civilians 
 But a life is a life and a killer is a killer 
 You're at a desk chillin' push a button kill a million 
 See the anguish of the parents 
 When they're carrying the body of the baby that they cherish 
 When innocent people perish 
 It's a very thin line between a soldier and a terrorist 
 Murder murder kill kill kill 
 Death and destruction a cap get pealed 
 Harm or heal destroy and rebuild 
 Shots still ring out the blood still spill 
 Murder murder kill kill kill 
 Death and destruction a cap get pealed 
 Harm or heal destroy and rebuild 
 Shots still ring out the blood still spill 
 Overseas we can mutilate and mangle 
 Let me give you an example what our troops are coming back to 
 Cold cities where the youth are getting strangled 
 The community in peril and our future looking narrow 
 Your school already failed you 
 The boys in blue will nail you they salute you with a barrel 
 The streets are a certified dead zone 
 Decorated with chalk lines and headstones 
 All the way live and every night the bullets flying 
 Even if you ain't dying you a traumatized survivor 
 When you grow up in a climate of overriding violence 
 You will never get beyond it it's always alive inside you 
 And death just surrounds you 
 Fallen classmates' ghosts haunt you 
 Crime just calls you cause you look at what you walk through 
 Ain't certain if you'll make it ain't sure you even want to 
 Murder murder kill kill kill 
 Death and destruction a cap get pealed 
 Harm or heal destroy and rebuild 
 Shots still ring out the blood still spill 
 Murder murder kill kill kill 
 Death and destruction a cap get pealed 
 Harm or heal destroy and rebuild 
 Shots still ring out the blood still spill 
 Choir 
 Tears and sorrow block the sunlight 
 Head low heart broke eyes closed tongue-tied 
 Waters raise the tide is climbing 
 Speeding time the sky is crying 
 Shots are fired bombs and sirens 
 War and riots mourning in America 
 Now that society forgot you 
 And they locked you in an obstacle course where nothing's possible 
 If you slip up and they caught you 
 They got boxes where they lock you make a million dollars off you 
 They rule you too rude to school 
 They screw you in a booth shoot electricity through you 
 Or inject death into you 
 On a television set and let it ooze through you 
 Every time a leader tries to stand up for our freedom 
 Someone claps them with the heater their brain and back leaking 
 A shame their family grieving the only way to see them 
 Is a displaced dream displayed in a museum 
 They say they built our nation for a reason 
 Then they stained it with the bleeding of the slaves that never seen it 
 I ain't hating I still want to believe it 
 And I'm not trying to leave it I just call it how I see it 
 Murder murder kill kill kill 
 Death and destruction a cap get pealed 
 Harm or heal destroy and rebuild 
 Shots still ring out the blood still spill 
 Murder murder kill kill kill 
 Death and destruction a cap get pealed 
 Harm or heal destroy and rebuild 
 Shots still ring out the blood still spill 
 They haven't got anything to lose 
 And they've got everything to gain 
 And they'll let you know in a minute 
 It takes two to tango. when I go, you go
