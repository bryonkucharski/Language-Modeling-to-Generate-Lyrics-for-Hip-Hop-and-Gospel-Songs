I shed my ex-wife kept my son with me 
 Now me smiling ear to ear now that's something to see, shit 
 I said my life, and my God and my songs 
 Good Lord Y'all 
 I said my life, and my God and my songs 
 Man no question use to always know that I was crazy 
 Guess it's safe to say I came a long way baby 
 Mama throwing dishes at my ex-wife bitching at me 
 Never did envision daddy could be this happy, shit 
 To me not broke is rich 
 Got a two bedroom a new sofa to sit 
 For the first time ain't go to Good Will or St. Steven's 
 But IKEA put that boy together last weekend 
 Out in NY I met a fly Puerto Rican 
 Dimed out sales girl Victoria's Secret 
 Took her on a train to Pennsylvaina for a weekend 
 That's eighteen months ago dog, guess where she been? 
 Frozen tundra chillin' with boy wonder 
 Done discovered love like a mother fucker 
 I tried to warn my baby that the winters no joke 
 She said "Big dick daddy I'll just get me your coat" 
 Goddamn 
 I said my life, and my God and my songs 
 Good Lord Y'all 
 I said my life, and my God and my songs 
 Good Lord Y'all 
 Said I'm gonna do it for you 
 I'm gonna do it for you 
 Feeling fly as hell right about now 
 I done pushed a whole heap of hell out of my house 
 Any orphanage will clove and feed a kid 
 But I raise my little man teach him to live 
 That's why he's 4 years old and can read like he was 6 
 Behave and recite the Qur'an in Arabic 
 Eat healthy, knows all the words to Laddy Daddy 
 Taught him to use the potty without his Mummy 
 It's three years away I ain't the least bit nervous 
 I feel like I'ma do it real big in my thirties 
 Honestly love everybody in my circle 
 Been with me since the scrimmage and the dress rehearsal 
 Oh let me tell you that my sweet potato pie 
 Will curl your toenails and bring tears to your eyes 
 And all corny bullshit aside 
 Your boys smiling for real the first time in my life 
 I said my life, and my God and my songs 
 Good Lord Y'all 
 I said my life, my God and my songs 
 Good Lord Y'all 
 Said I'm gonna do it for you 
 I'm gonna do it for you
