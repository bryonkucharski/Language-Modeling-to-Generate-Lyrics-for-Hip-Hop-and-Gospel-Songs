I am somebody 
 And we am and she am and he am and I am 
 Somebody 
 I was raised with the raised fist 
 Angela Davis summer sixty-eight Olympics 
 Train banging your wings against 
 The cage in the event you became cageless 
 The bane of my existence is to resist 
 Back never bent re-load never relent 
 Of All lights shone I'm glimmering glint 
 I was named after a king in our mist The Greatest 
 Changed the world in the ring with his fists 
 More so with the gift when rang from his lips 
 Bigger than just a individual gift 
 He had a vision for bringing dignity to the crib 
 Gold medalist in his Olympic event 
 Significant respect glistening off his neck 
 US flag waved the globe was silent 
 Wore it everywhere he went just to show what it meant 
 Stepped off the plane back on that pavement 
 The people hell bent that they will never repent 
 Celebrate him but his kin still clinched in a 
 Problem one piece of medal couldn't fix 
 Legend is he pitched it in the Ohio River 
 What good is recognition if I know that I'm a -victim 
 Expelled in a held back curriculum 
 Class president slash second class citizen 
 Diligent to fight for people 
 Nineteen years old sacrificed his ego 
 So here we go salute my namesake 
 Many are successful very few are great 
 Right on y'all. I am somebody 
 And we am and she am and he am and I am 
 Somebody 
 I am he am she am and we am 
 Somebody
