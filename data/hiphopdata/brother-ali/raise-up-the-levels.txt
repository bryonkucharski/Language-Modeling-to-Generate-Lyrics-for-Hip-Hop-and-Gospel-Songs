Chorus (The Grouch): 
 Raise Up The Levels cause stakes is high 
 You don't know when till you make a try 
 If you ain't pushin' then say goodbye 
 Cause you could die today [x2] 
 Today, tomorrow [x4] 
 Give thanks, give praise [x4] 
 Verse One [Luckyiam.PSC]: 
 I give thanks CMA think tank 
 What's the long face for like Lloyd Banks 
 We rank top notch 
 We hunger for more 
 We're finally in stores 
 Finally off tour 
 Long enough to cut an album 
 Bored with the bullshit 
 Blessed I don't lose sight of how we could lose this 
 In a blink of an eye 
 Life is too short to be living that lie 
 So here's my confession like I'm bout to, I'm bout to...[screaming] 
 Try is all I ever did and when 
 Even when I took a lost I was inchin' in 
 They could never hold us back I was with my friends 
 I mean it's all automatic once we grip the pencil 
 Insult intelligent 
 Kinfolk irrelevance 
 Get dissed 
 Get with the standard of elegance 
 We raise the bar high above and we hold weight 
 While they hold on the nuts and stay so fake 
 Verse Two [Brother Ali]: 
 Yeah I can arrange that 
 Give thanks that I ain't bang your brain back 
 Against your skull doctor 'cause I can change that 
 Last few years touring on the same track 
 Plus did the country with Lucky's stank ass (ha!) 
 Fire In The Eyes is what I opitamize 
 Got ride or die in the pit of my soul 
 And then I'm spiteful but I get it right though 
 And then you want to criticize bitch give me my doe! 
 I crawl out of my hole with a lot of my folks 
 If the whole rap business disintegrated 
 Keep your eyes on the Rhymesayers guys 
 And the L's 'cause we family orintinitated 
 And I gained your respect and it's not from a chain on my neck 
 But my chain of events 
 I offer my joy and my pain and the lens 
 And remain independent the same as the Legends 
 Stayed authentic to the same old essence 
 Learned from the past and obeyed all the lessons 
 Mastered the craft that came as a blessing 
 I do not kiss ass for nobody no exceptions 
 Verse Three (The Grouch): 
 I give thanks for every minute on this planet 
 I live the length of life, provided I manage 
 To write my own script 
 Clone this god damn it 
 I'm gon dis 
 I wasn't shown shit but love 
 Now bring it back to when I was just a scrub 
 Sleeping on hardwood floors without a rug 
 Living that Thug Life without being a thug 
 Waking up hungry, yet guided from above 
 Despite smug comments I'm on it 
 My shit stayed honest I promise 
 I'll never fall the fuck off I want it 
 I'm gonna get it 
 That's as good as done did it 
 Go on hit it 
 It won't fall 
 You can't fuck with it at all 
 You can't go and get it from the mall 
 I lit it up, smoked it, now pass it around 
 As long as I live I live passionate now
