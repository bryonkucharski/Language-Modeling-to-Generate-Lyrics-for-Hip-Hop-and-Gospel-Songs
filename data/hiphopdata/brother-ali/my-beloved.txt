Hold your moments 
 Faith in God high thinking and simple living 
 Work hard deep love no conditions 
 Gentle heart head level clear vision 
 Back tall firm in our conviction 
 Smile through tears laugh through the tragedy 
 All we got is each other must love radically 
 Passionately peaceful fight for it fanatically 
 Premium on people magic humanity 
 Dance like nobody's looking sing as if no one's listening 
 Live and love out loud and let your spirit glisten 
 Feet firm on the dirt head in the sky 
 Serve when the sun is at work dream when he hides 
 And know that the water that well up in your eyes 
 Is the same when a loved one is born as when they die 
 As sure as every hello is eventually goodbye 
 The art of truly living is learning how to die 
 Wherever you go 
 May the good lord bless your heart and soul 
 My beloved my beloved my beloved 
 I want you to know 
 That your love and your wisdom touched me so 
 My beloved my beloved my beloved 
 Bless your soul so precious and delicate 
 Powerfully compassionate 
 Your friendship held me together when the threat of unraveling 
 Had me at the brink feeling inadequate 
 When the sky got dreary my eyes got teary, my 
 Heart got weary you were right there near me 
 Only reason I ain't laid up in some cemetery 
 When I was in fear somebody cared enough to hear me 
 Anything that I do in this life of mine 
 From this point is part you for the gifts you provide 
 Only way to repay you is live right and shine 
 Trust me when I tell you that you're still on my mind 
 Wherever you go 
 May the good lord bless your heart and soul 
 My beloved my beloved my beloved 
 Young lovers passion in their stare 
 Hanging in the air challenging their fears 
 Catch a passing moment and grab it in the clear 
 Desperately attempting to stretch it into years 
 Her soft and elegant he firm and gallant 
 Words dancing between them hanging in the balance 
 Grins and glances translate every sentence 
 Into the language where the future smiles at us 
 Love's not careful neither is it fearful 
 The thought of living without is unbearable 
 So listen young lady this me thanking you 
 No matter what you will always have my gratitude 
 Wherever you go 
 May the good lord bless your heart and soul 
 My beloved my beloved my beloved
