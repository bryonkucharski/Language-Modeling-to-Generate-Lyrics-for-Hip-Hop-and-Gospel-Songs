Damn, man. I'm broker than an old VCR, man. I need a job. Are they hiring at your 
 Job? I got a stack of red bills at my house. It looks like Valentine's Day at the crib. My 
 Kids are eating left-over leftovers, man. I can't fool them no more. It's job time 
 Every day every day 
 Got to work every day 
 Every day every day 
 Got to work every day 
 My God there's got to be more to life than this 
 There's got to be a bigger reason that I exist 
 Work to eat to earn my keep 
 To ensure somewhere to sleep and spend the weekend buying shit 
 Don't need economists to know I need pot to piss 
 Follow politics man I ain't got time to think 
 What I got to set aside for my retirement 
 Cop a double shift pay somebody to watch the kids 
 Sick of all this but can't take an off day 
 Doctor's office I can't swing the co pay 
 Trapped in a network luck just to get work 
 They celebrate every week nobody gets hurt 
 Greed could never leave well enough alone 
 They keep on squeezing till we bleed from every bone 
 And we'll strive hard and stress about the rent 
 Probably still die poor and in debt without a cent but 
 Every day every day 
 Got to work every day 
 Every day every day 
 Got to work every day 
 I guess I'll carry my ass down to the county and see what they're talking about. But 
 You know they treat you like you shot somebody just because you need a little help 
 You're telling my you ain't never been down on your luck 
 Never tried to make them ends meet but just got stuck 
 Never slaved at a gig like a bum with a cup 
 Added all your pennies up and you still ain't had enough 
 And the jobs full up they ain't hiring 
 I'm barely surviving not enough to get by with 
 Hunger is a constant problem stomach steady growling 
 People getting shot in my environment 
 Study go to college is what them people hollering 
 Too many road blocks in the way it's not an option 
 To say that its impossible I would be lying 
 But you ain't got a chance if you're not up in that top ten 
 A couple got a scholarship but I am not them 
 Ain't got the skills to pay the bills so my pockets are thin 
 So until I cop a gig and my hardship ends 
 Fixing to line my self up at your welfare office again 
 And I expect to be accepted as the man that I am 
 Respectfully and appreciatively Ma'am 
 God damn you must be out of your mind 
 Every day every day 
 Got to work every day 
 Every day every day 
 Got to work every day 
 Do you see this Tea Party stuff, man? Them people look broke their damn self. Are 
 They serious? 
 People stressing here's the question 
 How they get people drinking tea in a recession 
 It's deception how absurd is this 
 How are so many poor people conservative 
 A pro artist I put it in the good music 
 A con artist job's to make you look stupid 
 Lookie here I'll teach you how to look trough it 
 First thing you need to know every con got a hook to it 
 They seduce you with a little wealth 
 Say you could have some of these crumbs for yourself 
 If the government doesn't make us help anyone else 
 You stuck a red sign on your foreclosed house 
 Make you think you're taking back your nation 
 Then they turn it over to a major corporation 
 Those companies took the jobs overseas 
 And you handed them the wallet out your pocket for free 
 You're staring in the sky with dollar signs for eyes 
 The blind right wing of a bird that can't fly 
 Just a peacock with a poked out gut 
 Who's too fat to fly so his ass just strut but 
 Every day every day 
 Got to work every day 
 Every day every day 
 Got to work every day 
 They're so criminal minded we've been blinded 
 Looking for an honest job and can't find it 
 They got a job bill we got a light bill 
 If we don't pay ours our life is quite real 
 Every day every day 
 Got to work every day 
 Every day every day 
 Got to work every day
