(Brother Ali) 
 Damage, uh, damage, uh (4x) 
 Y'all know good and goddamn well 
 You're fucking with a brother who ain't never had his hand held 
 And never seemed passed out 
 Rolling baby strollers over broken floating bottles 
 In a frozen forest with a dying shred of hope inside you 
 For this respect, I sweated and bled 
 And have yet to be discredited by what a critic ever said 
 "We're unaware of his racial make-up 
 We know he's an albino but can't science the face up!" 
 Never question what I am 
 G-O-D knows if you don't, you can never understand 
 So you need only know that I'm unrelenting 
 Nothing breaking, never ending, seldom bending 
 Cast shadows like light descending 
 Must not discuss divorce with the case still pending, but 
 I got some shit to tell you on my next record 
 For now, we and Sage Francis connected and did-- 
 (*Whispers*) 
 Damage, uh (repeated) 
 (Slug) 
 Wrote this one a couple days after Christmas 
 'Hope' is one struggled game that's persistent 
 0 plus 1 2, for Self, no assistance 
 Pistol clear before this new year existed 
 Somebody get the door 
 Fuck it, let 'em snore 
 It's all been said before 
 Buried in a metaphor 
 Lucy is hip-hop, and Jacob's a prince 
 Sean is an old man, and Slug is a PIMP now 
 They say I'm buggin, cause of the way I love 'em 
 Nervous, 'cause I know I'll never make the perfect husband 
 What, they treat me like LL for art fucks 
 They hang out and argue about my clown thought and *snort rocks* 
 <---(Reversed) 
 From the twin cities, call it the deuce 
 Skinny grizzly-bear alcoholic on the loose 
 Sing with me, show your love, give me proof 
 Flip the switch to damage and make this planet move
