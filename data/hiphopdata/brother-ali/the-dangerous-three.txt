Said they just don't make 'em like this no more 
 In fact they never made 'em like this before 
 I'm 'bout the baddest man that ya eyes done saw 
 Baby, I'm down by law 
 Dangerous 
 Life gave me nothing free, but my ugly 
 Ass mug and a couple of fat nuts to squeeze 
 Dick dangling down in my dungarees 
 Hungry beast, I'll chase your ass up a tree 
 You know what's up with me, I'm sucker-free 
 Not uptown or uppity, it's not my cup of tea 
 Feared one in the streets, won't nothing bleed 
 Except my knuckle meat, caught up in your fucking teeth 
 Brother, please, I'm out here rhyming for survival 
 Plus I got a outta-body-mind-blowing live show 
 Squad'll find dimes, follow me wherever I go 
 Got them on their knees trying to honor my arrival 
 Quick Draw McGraw, this mic of mine, I'm a prime time bidaw 
 Down by lidaw, broke dick, big dog 
 Who the hell am I? The A, the L, the I, and I'm the God damn shit, y'all 
 Dangerous 
 You should see me swing the jimmy 
 Don't get me started 
 I'm golden era, '88 baby highly regarded 
 I get stupid, dookie, doo-doo, def, dumb, retarded 
 Watch you fade like a high top when I drop 
 Leave you flattened like a pancake at IHOP 
 With a pistol I'm a nice shot 
 Many battles are losable, losing isn't unusual 
 Life is brutal, but beautiful, birth allude to a funeral 
 I'm straight raw, cocaine natural 
 You that flesh-eating veterinarian drug used to de-worm cattle 
 The same way Big flipped mics I'mma show you how I run thing 
 I'm the Don Corleone, Cornelius, Trump, King 
 Is the world your or mine? I'm an immortal in his prime 
 Structure doesn't follow the corporate design 
 I'm snapping your porcelain spine 
 To deep for the mortal mind every time I'm recording a rhyme 
 They find that I'm crossing the line 
 If you're blind and ignoring the grind 
 It's sickening, ain't a chick alive I won't stick my dick in 
 I'm more shameless than Hammer dancing for popcorn chicken 
 Ace was the ink before Irv Gotti was laundering loot 
 And he dropped Slaughtahouse before they was ever forming a group 
 Fuck being miserable, whether it's the mental or in the flesh physical 
 Blessed are the poor in spirit 
 Yeah, I took it Biblical, I'm so dangerous 
 Dangerous 
 When this mic's in my hand I'm a cannibal man 
 Eat my own kind, damn, I'm an animal, fam 
 And if you a grown man then stand if you can 
 On your own two feet with a tangible plan 
 Now my plan's ripping them all, never fall 
 And achieve all goals like I'm kicking a ball 
 Like taking out your dick in the mall 
 Warn everyone you see that it's me and I'm sicker than y'all 
 And this track's like a brick in the jaw, a bat to the head 
 Go ahead, get back in the bed 
 Keep sleeping, I'll be the nightmare of your dreams 
 Spit right, the flow's tight like a pair of your jeans 
 Take those off, y'all dudes feminine style, so foul 
 Meanwhile, men, women, and child praise me, the epitome of the best 
 Deadly like three in the chest, dangerous 
 Dangerous
