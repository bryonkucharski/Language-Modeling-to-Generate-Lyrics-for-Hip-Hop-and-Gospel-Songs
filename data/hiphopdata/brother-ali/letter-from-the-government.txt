I got a letter from the government the other day 
 I opened and read and burned that man 
 The way that I live don't concern that man 
 We gon' have to settle this another way 
 When the knuckles turn white and the eyes begin bulging 
 I take an honest look at my life its insulting 
 And I been sulking about it all week 
 Hearing the dull screech of metal grinding the concrete 
 And sparks dance where the worst of both worlds clash 
 Meaning the blue tyrants and my broke ass 
 I understand this is pawn take pawn shit 
 But I'll be damned if you shoot me on my lawn bitch 
 Think twice before shining that light 
 In my drawers in the alley in the middle of the night 
 Garbage bag and house shoes put two and two together 
 I ain't no drug smuggler I'm a struggling brother 
 I have this dream where I go nuts 
 Dial 911 from the roof and post up 
 Decorate your hard head when you came in the cruiser 
 And paint your rod red in the name of Abruka 
 What kind of sucker would I have to be after these years 
 Of you harassing and attacking me to run and join your cavalry 
 Imagine me all GI Joe'd up in Afghanistan somewhere prepared to go nuts 
 You clinically crazy if you think you could pay me 
 A figure that could make me slay these innocent babies 
 I identify with a slave wishing to break free 
 He was victimised by the same system that raped me 
 Look at us poor just trying to get our foot in the door 
 And unfortunately hooked in this war 
 We were both coerced to get enlisted 
 But his was with a trigger mine was living conditions 
 We're one in the same but in the name of some freedom 
 I'm supposed to put one in his brain like something will change 
 What freedom? I ain't writing for no president 
 Send the kids to die when we didn't even elect the bitch 
 Listen I'm in no position to judge a young stud 
 Tryn'a use the military to come the fuck up 
 'Cause self preservation is the first law of nature 
 Play your cards smart remember what the fucks up 
 Its really no different from crack pedaling when it 
 Comes to dying and killing for a dream you were given 
 Last thing in your mind is how you seen by the system 
 N' be willing to go to those extremes for your vision 
 Shit I'm no smarter I'm fucking retarded 
 I just know enough to not eat directly where the dog shits 
 If Uncle Sam wants to threaten my health 
 Tell him he have to come and get me himself 
 ...Motherfucker
