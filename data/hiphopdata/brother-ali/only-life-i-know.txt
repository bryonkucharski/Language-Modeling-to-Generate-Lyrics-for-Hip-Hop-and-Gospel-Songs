(It's my life) 
 Yeah, the only one that I'll ever know 
 Feeling extra low 
 Please let me go 
 Hold on, no 
 (It's my life) 
 Yeah, the only that I'll ever know 
 And it stressed me so 
 Oh God, bless me soul 
 Hold on 
 Wether it's the projects or a trailer park mess 
 Raggedy the apartment complex 
 With a stressed out single mom sitting on the steps 
 Waiting on the mailman, looking for a check 
 Boys on the corner, pushing out the chest 
 Questing for anything that resembles respect 
 Young girls swinging their hair with every step 
 Looking for affection, settling for sex 
 Bodies decorated with tattoos and chains 
 Trying to put armor between you and pain 
 Wood grain steering wheel, the bass bang 
 But not enough to drown out the hatred in your brain 
 The only out is smoking out 
 Get lean, get wet, get meth, get tore down 
 Cause who the hell would want to stick around? 
 Put me in a haze, I ain't never coming out 
 (It's my life) 
 Yeah, the only one that I'll ever know 
 Feeling extra low 
 Please let me go 
 Hold on, no 
 (It's my life) 
 Yeah, the only that I'll ever know 
 And it stressed me so 
 Oh God, bless me soul 
 Hold on 
 They just wanna get you in the system, stick you into prison 
 List you in the military ship you to the desert 
 Pigs don't exist for you to make a decent living 
 But we got three illegal wars to shoot the pigs from 
 Keep stressing marvels and personal decisions 
 Tell me what's marvel about these conditions 
 Who decided you don't got enough to teach children? 
 Stay spending billions, on stadiums and prisons 
 How many roles can folks really choose? 
 When you're oppressed only three lead to you 
 First one is follow the rules and stay in school 
 Be the square dude, that society approves 
 Get a little job or a shitty apartment 
 Sub-prime mortgage in a failing house market 
 The after your life dedication and hardship 
 You died just as poor as you was when you started 
 Fuck that, what's up with the second option? 
 You could always hit the corner and try to get it popping 
 Get fast guap when you're out dropping and clocking 
 But, chances are that you'll probably die violent 
 The best hope that you got is getting knocked 
 And end up with a job in a prison metal shop 
 They ain't paying nothing but three hots and a cotch 
 Don't you know that's the biggest hustle they got? 
 Or door three you can get on that welfare 
 But they ain't trying to help, they'll put you in hell there 
 Give you just enough so you're not gonna starve 
 And constantly harass you while you're looking for a job 
 Do lock up and someone that got you to punch a clock 
 And they found about it and your check is getting dot 
 Can't win for losing, dehumanizing 
 You'll never get caught up, you caught up in a cycle 
 (It's my life) 
 Yeah, the only one that I'll ever know 
 Feeling extra low 
 Please let me go 
 Hold on, no 
 (It's my life) 
 Yeah, the only that I'll ever know 
 And it stressed me so 
 Oh God, bless me soul 
 Hold on
