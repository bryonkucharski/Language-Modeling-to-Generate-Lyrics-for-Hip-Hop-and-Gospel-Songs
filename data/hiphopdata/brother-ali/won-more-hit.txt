Please oh please oh please 
 Just give me just one more hit 
 Please oh please oh please 
 Just give me just one more hit 
 It's an exorcism bitches 
 A horror story 
 Okay we stole you from your mother and we beat you red and bloody 
 And we made you build a country and we never gave you nothing 
 But a savior with our ugly face painted on the front 
 And we let you sing about it entertain us every Sunday 
 Sing when you're worshipping sing when you're working 
 And see if you can sing your self out of the hurt you're in 
 Please oh please give me just one more hit 
 Make it extra special and you might not get the whip 
 People want to hear your instruments and voices 
 It's just so annoying have to always come and join you 
 It reminds us of the horrible conditions that we're causing 
 Really rather avoid it try hard to ignore it 
 Give me one performance and an engineer record it 
 Then we can all enjoy it and we never have to know you 
 Please oh please give me just one more hit 
 I sell it 'round the planet and I'm keeping every cent 
 Treat you like a hero and we all come to see you 
 In a big fancy theatre dressed in a tuxedo 
 Going to have to seat you in the kitchen when you feed you 
 A place this regal doesn't serve your kind of people 
 Love to get and earful and praise and even cheer you 
 But we're still too fearful to think of eating near you 
 Please oh please give me just one more hit 
 You sing so very nice but I don't want you 'round my kids 
 Please oh please oh please 
 Just give me just one more hit 
 Please oh please oh please 
 Just give me just one more hit 
 It's an exorcism bitches 
 A horror story 
 Fetishize your culture yet while it's still among you 
 We analyze insult it and criticize and judge it 
 Look down upon you say your music's from the jungle 
 And a civilized country couldn't gain anything from it 
 Said it's from the devil and it cause nothing but trouble 
 And tell you that you're ugly and we think it's so disgusting 
 But oh please still give me one more hit 
 Give me 20 years see if I can learn to spit 
 Your soul power got me so excited 
 That I went home and I tried it till I could do it just like you 
 Just a little bit lighter tired with less fire 
 Stiff sanitized to the white people's liking 
 Now they're so inspired by the way that I recite it 
 Celebrate a pirate as our nation's greatest writer 
 Please oh please give me just one more hit 
 We like your music better when it's spilling from our lips 
 You create it we can't relate so we hate it 
 Say it's too flagrant human nature too naked 
 But be patient eventually you'll escape it 
 Then we take it reshape it rename it and claim it 
 If you get in the business we'll just find a way to flip it 
 We don't celebrate success you're getting for a minute 
 After years of getting rich if you ever make us split it 
 We'll just film your cars and cribs call you materialistic 
 Boys in blue harass you say you're too successful 
 Do you for the taxes and sue you for the samples 
 You just get a plaque so you can glue it on your mantle 
 Looking dapper when you tap a little tune on your piano 
 Patented your soul gave your heart a bar code 
 Now so appalled at the gall to download 
 Please oh please give me just one more hit 
 P.S. Thank you and suck my dick 
 Please oh please oh please 
 Please oh please oh please 
 Just give me just one more hit 
 Please oh please oh please 
 Just give me just one more hit 
 It's an exorcism bitches 
 A horror story
