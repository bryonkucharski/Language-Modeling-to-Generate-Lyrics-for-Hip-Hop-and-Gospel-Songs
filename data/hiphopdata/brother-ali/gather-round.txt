Ain't no stopping the calling I'm a warrior scholar 
 With the pad and the pen or with the sword and the chopper 
 Look at how far I got if you lost I could guide you 
 In between two extremes like Safa and Marwa 
 In the desert like Bedouins in search of water 
 Except we're thirsting for power up in this urban drama 
 Every day our sons and daughters are led to the slaughter 
 Indoctrinated by a complacent social order 
 Decapitated they're trying to cut our jugular vain 
 That's the sacred lifeline from heart to the brain 
 Make us blind to mankind's suffering pain 
 Ugliness worldwide that's done in our name 
 So the only thing we're seeing is what we can gain 
 Precious blood shed in vain and nothing is changed 
 Drugged up in daze in a comfortable maze 
 Upscale slaves in luxury cages 
 But the weak keep crying and the innocent dying 
 And these are the times when the real freedom fighters gather 'round 
 I said the cities catch fire and the flames grow higher 
 And the poor and the pious get inspired and decide to gather 
 'Round 
 When the times get dire and the mighty are liars 
 And the righteous fighting for their life get organized and gather 
 'Round 
 When the prophets are silenced and the tyrants are giants 
 And David sets his sights on Goliath and we finally gather 
 'Round 
 Hostile environment locked in a conflict 
 Wandering lost in an impossible climate 
 Boxed in confinement democracy hostage 
 Bound for the towers monsters in the cockpit 
 Following blind unconscious accomplice 
 Judged by time indicted for our silence 
 Couple years ago I made a statement 
 Can't figure a single Goddamn way to change it 
 As of late I made adjustments to my language 
 Numbers are the only thing the people gain strength in 
 If we're going to change we got to step up our relations 
 Got to see our own selves in each other's faces 
 Share each other's spaces give each other room 
 And hear each other's pain bare witness to the truth 
 And the ground gets holy when the ground is stood 
 And the goods may odd but the odds are good 
 But the weak keep crying and the innocent dying 
 And these are the times when the real freedom fighters gather 'round 
 I said the cities catch fire and the flames grow higher 
 And the poor and the pious get inspired and decide to gather 
 'Round 
 When the times get dire and the mighty are liars 
 And the righteous fighting for their life get organized and gather 
 'Round 
 When the prophets are silenced and the tyrants are giants 
 And David sets his sights on Goliath and we finally gather 
 'Round 
 "That is why I challenge you now to stand together. Because together we've got 
 Power and we can make decisions." 
 Justice 
 Is somewhere in between reading sad poems and 40 ounces of gasoline crashing 
 Through windows 
 Justice 
 Is between plans and action 
 Between writing letters to congressmen and clapping a captain 
 Between raising legal defense funds and putting a gun on the bailiff and taking the 
 Judge captive 
 It is between prayer and fasting 
 Between burning and blasting 
 Freedom 
 Is between the mind and the soul 
 It is between the lock and load 
 Between the zeal of the young and the patience of the old 
 Freedom 
 Is between the finger and the trigger 
 It is between the page and the pen 
 Between the grenade and the pin 
 Between righteous anger and keeping one in the chamber 
 So I say down with Goliath 
 I say down with Goliath 
 But we must learn, know, write, read 
 We must kick, bite, yell, scream 
 We must pray, fast, live, dream, fight, kill and die 
 Free
