So I never told the world that the first time I toured 
 I came home to find that little man had been ignored 
 Two years old got a hold of water you had boiled 
 And burned his little head and his face while you snored 
 You were afraid of bringing him to the hospital 
 'Cause two weeks ago your mom called the cops on you 
 Child protection paid a visit 
 Ruled that the crib was unfit to raise kids in 
 I'm working ten hour days at the gig then 
 You were unemployed all null and void 
 Now I ain't trying to be no Sigmund Freud 
 But ain't you supposed to have instincts when it comes to the boy 
 I called a cab a brought him to county hospital 
 They shaved the hair and burnt flesh off his skull 
 Held him overnight to fight infection 
 I slept sitting up in a chair directly next to him 
 I just knew you would join us but instead 
 Hopped your ass on the bus went home and went to bed 
 That's the very moment I divorced you in my head 
 God might forgive you for that I never did 
 All you need right now 
 Faheem we can see the throne from here 
 I may never sit there but brother you're the heir 
 Pull up a chair let pop bend your ear 
 Here baby dry those tears 
 I know you wonder why your mother does the things that she do 
 Well it's not because she doesn't love you 
 It's because she grew up in something they call foster care 
 That's when strangers raise you your mom's not there 
 Imagine how she felt when she was your age 
 Going from place to place never feeling safe 
 Never having love never having faith 
 She probably thought the world was a big scary place 
 Where was her mommy at well that's kind of sad 
 She used drugs to forget the problems she had 
 There was a new one back then they called crack 
 Once you try it there was almost no coming back 
 She couldn't be the mommy she wanted to be 
 She was chasing a high all in the street 
 Won't tell you no lie real is all I can be 
 I believe only truth can set you free 
 There's a whole lot of pain in your bloodline 
 But there's a whole lot of strength in the sunshine 
 Lean back let the new day greet you 
 'Cause you're standing on the shoulders of a people 
 Who been beat down and treated unequal 
 But the prayer that they made now has reached you 
 It's plain to see it's true 
 Beautiful prince I wish they could see you 
 All you need right now
