"I sometimes feel like I am impersonating the dark subconscious of the whole human race" 
 Verse One: 
 To touch me is a luxury that most never experience 
 A Lyricist, Loungin in the shadow where my spirit is 
 I'm baring this cross for so long 
 There's not a care in this world that can cause me to join the heretics 
 I carry this solution inside and can't express it 
 I try to shake the Word and escape the adolescence 
 The lessons that God taught me won't let me rest easy 
 There's no escapin' this whole creation that sees me 
 I be a ray of light amongst the dark 
 Half of this poem I write, in the night I travel alone 
 Mappin' my own route 
 Tryin' to pull out as soon as possible 
 Because every new person I meet is a new obstacle 
 ? Oracles I speak with are bleak with 
 Forecast if I keep this 
 Damn, I got a secret 
 I seated in a hull of a ship 
 My destination unknown now 
 Forsaken my Lord I'm all alone now 
 And lack the know how to show my folks how to make it 
 Motivated by the hatred in a world where nothing is sacred 
 My knees shakin' my blood runs cold 
 I start tremblin' 
 My heart dangling by a thread 
 Voices in my head say 
 All I know is I don't wanna know what I know 
 To be in this position 
 (Hell no!) 
 I'm going fishin' 
 I'm sorta wishin' my people didn't concern me 
 (But they do!) 
 So I got a three day journey [X2] 
 Verse Two: 
 Up above I hear the waves rushin' 
 Heart bangin' like percussion 
 Mucus in my lungs slushin' 
 Just then, two men seize me 
 Release me among strangers 
 One spoke for him, his voice reveals anger 
 "The danger that we're in is because of you 
 We don't know you. What's your name?" 
 "Jonah" 
 "We're gonna have to throw you over" 
 Before I knew it I was movin' toward the ragin' sea 
 Then creation turned against me 
 There's no savin' me 
 I should call out to God but what's the chance of him answerin'? 
 A more disobedient man, there hasn't been 
 There's no chance for me, so fuck it I'll drown 
 I'll just relax and let the strong current take me down 
 As I approach the abyss with body and soul 
 Yo, this large mouth fish swallowed me whole! 
 From the belly of the ship to the belly of the fish 
 And the only thing that my brain thinks is this 
 Verse Three: 
 There is no escapin' this situation 
 I can't even die 
 I ran out of tears and can't even cry 
 I broke down and saw God, I should have followed his plan 
 Then the fish went and spit, spit me out of the land 
 I land on dry land 
 Hot sand scorchin' my steps 
 Sunlight burn down on my neck 
 A little plant grew up around me 
 And shade me with leaves 
 It's a three day journey to my people I believe 
 As long as I'm livin' I can still accept the mission 
 I'm fishin' for those who can listen to this religion 
 As long as I'm livin' I can still accept the mission 
 I'm fishin' for those who can listen to this religion
