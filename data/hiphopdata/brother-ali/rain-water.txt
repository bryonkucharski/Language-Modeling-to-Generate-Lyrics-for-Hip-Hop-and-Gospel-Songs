A question was raised to me the other day 
 "Why it seem you always have joy?" 
 Well, I'd like to take time to set the record straight... 
 All the joy I've ever known 
 Has disappeared 
 - In the motherfuckin thin air 
 Like it's never even been there 
 My joy left me y'all 
 God's rain water flow through the same gutter 
 That we, walk today gotta stay brave brother 
 Keep your lips stiff, keep your fist clenched 
 At times you gotta kick your way through this bitch 
 And I can't stop feelin' guilty smiling 
 A wise man once told me that every cloud has a silver lining 
 I wanted to believe him but it's a trick to find 'em 
 When the people around me continue dying 
 Granddad was in the twilight of his life 
 When he closed his eyes tight and opened his wrists wide 
 What make a tenth round fighter with the winning score 
 Decide he need to throw the towel before the whistle blow 
 Maybe I'll never know 
 But I inherited his poetic soul so the symbolism's yet to show 
 Was life so obscene that death's more serene? 
 Or was an old author tryin' to write his own closing scene? 
 Nothing stings like knowing that the woman that gave me this life 
 Is being eaten from the inside 
 I thought we never make shit right 
 I wish I had viewed it once clear before you were done here 
 That's two in one year that I let leave here 
 Loving me without sheding one single tear 
 Either I'm one of the strongest people left 
 Or y'all should stone me for even tryin' to steal breath 
 And God's rain water flow through the same gutter 
 That we, walk today gotta stay brave brother 
 Keep your lips stiff, keep your fist clenched 
 At times you gotta kick your way through this bitch 
 They say shit's strapped but you are by yourself, ain't ya? 
 Damn straight, I got a jail cell nature 
 Been boxed up but I never been settled in 
 Him got tough started developin leather skin 
 I learned to make that face that tells predators 
 It's better to re-assess just who you bout to wrestle with 
 I'm on one like the first kick drum of the beat 
 Clear my lungs, spit blood on the street 
 They tellin' me we got nuttin to fear but fear itself 
 But I fear I have no human fear left 
 Some day I'm gonna wanna peel back these calouses 
 And really feel life again and that's what my challenge is 
 I been kickin and bitin for so long and 
 When they throw me a rescue rope I'll be too weary to hold on 
 And see the light, so I sing through the tears 
 In the key of life, the way a wounded eagle might 
 And God's rain water flow through the same gutter 
 That we, walk today gotta stay brave brother 
 Keep your lips stiff, keep your fist clenched 
 At times you gotta kick your way through this bitch 
 My joy left me y'all 
 She don't show her face around these parts 
 Every time she come she get chased off 
 So she stay distant 
 If it wern't for him squintin he wouldn't know the sun was out 
 I hate every word that come outta his fuckin' mouth 
 Ladies treat him special, don't know nuttin 'bout him 
 If they saw what his wife see they wouldn't fuss about him 
 He can't do shit right but rap and make babies 
 And babies need daddy at home consistent 
 But rap keep daddy on the road religious 
 So even in my two loves my soul's so conflicted 
 My son came into this world innocent 
 He deserves everything that he needs to live in it 
 And this home I made for him is broken 
 I'm hopin his love for me will never grow thin 
 It hurts daddy to no end to know when 
 You're cryin at the hospital I'm out tryin' to rock a show 
 I made a vow that we'd never be broke again 
 And I'd never be a burden on another friend 
 So when I'm sweatin on my farewell stage 
 And wrote my last hook in my last rhyme book 
 When I get my last nod of approval from my family 
 This is the man that I have to be 
 And God's rain water flow through the same gutter 
 That we, walk today gotta stay brave brother 
 Keep your lips stiff, keep your fist clenched 
 At times you gotta kick your way through this bitch 
 Sometimes 
 I feel 
 Like I'm Al-most gone
