Truth so heavy it could rumble the earth 
 I dunked paint brush up in a bucket of words 
 Ain't Nothing interrupting the urge 
 Might cut you worse than unguarded love when it hurts 
 Try to hold it in and my muscles will burst 
 Do an Incredible Hulk through my shirt 
 A verse make an old lady jump up in the church 
 Pass a plate around pulling bucks out her purse 
 Foremost and first my hunger and thirst 
 Is not for no blood-stained paper but my love to be heard 
 Reap what I sowed in the earth 
 Now watch what emerge out a soul that's disturbed 
 Leaning on the very last nerve of you scary ass herbs 
 Fake thugs and arrogant nerds 
 Fuck no homo you a no home owning old grown 
 Unsigned chump month behind on your car loan 
 You got balls looking down on me 
 Or got a mirror on the floor trying to find Ali 
 And dressed flyly but so afraid to soar 
 You're all dressed up and got no place to go 
 And so play a roll there's no hope of living 
 More like go broke pretending 
 Your whole image is imagined I manage 
 Low expectations high standards 
 Hip hop is the legacy of the jazz kings 
 Kick rocks I'm one of the last standing 
 Last thing I do is overstate the obvious 
 Mainstream poppiness underground sloppiness 
 Dumbed down thuggery and pussy hungry consciousness 
 Revolution for sale greedy communist 
 Seinfeld rap your show about nothing 
 Poetry played it's all about production 
 Trying to get placements play like you're famous 
 Ain't added greatness to nary a playlist 
 Take this bitch take offense 
 Or if it don't apply let it fly say amen 
 Time's up on y'all posturing imposters 
 I don't give a damn if you're starving or copping Oscars 
 Out here grinding or floss in your ivory towers 
 I don't give a shit about your pants or how you rock em 
 I ain't bitter or backpacker or conscious 
 Just want y'all the fuck out my ear with that nonsense 
 From the office of Ali and Jake and them 
 If you feel me raise a hand say amen
