I dictate while most MC's lactate 
 Can't wait for me to smack greats and fuck 'em till my sack breaks 
 They stand still with a little bit of spittle 
 Drippin' off the middle of they lips tryin' to light a cigarette 
 And I'mma watch 'em all choke on my vomit 
 Took apart, shook up they heart, they died on it 
 And I promise, if you could hide from this monster 
 You'd quit tryin' to ride on my divide and conquer 
 Some gotta die 'fore the dumb realize 
 Not everyone can fly, most don't have wings 
 Keep takin' a nap, wear a brick for a cap 
 Or get the fuck off the lap before you lose everything 
 I spit shrapnel while the villagers babble 
 Slice deep, pull, peel and let the skin unravel 
 We're here to scrape off a layer of your make-up 
 So we can see what a bitch is really made of 
 I step off in your hoola-hoop cypher with my eyes all aglow 
 Walkin' tall enough to make your half moon whole 
 You don't need to get duct-taped to the bathroom floor 
 'Cause I don't think your shit is flavor - the rats do, though 
 You and your little bitch buddies think you're Thelma and Louise 
 'Cause you got a drum machine and you throw jealous to the breeze 
 You need to respect a fuckin' legend when he breathes 
 'Fore you get a K-Swiss logo embedded in your knees 
 Shock the body-body, rock the consciousness 
 Stagger the imagination, box your esophagus 
 The paradigm, you stepped past the line 
 And I show you why the masterminds have got a fuckin' axe to grind 
 Street magician like David Blaine with these songs 
 Crypt-walkin' through your mental corridor with metal cleats on 
 Slug got the weed smoke, Ant got the beats broke 
 And your fuckin' eyebrows might grow back, but your teeth won't 
 (You gonna look pretty funny tryin' to eat corn on a cob with no fuckin' teeth)
