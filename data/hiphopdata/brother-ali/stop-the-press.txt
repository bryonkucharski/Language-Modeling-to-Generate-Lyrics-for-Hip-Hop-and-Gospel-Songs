Another one of them long ass breaks. Damn, Brother Ali where the hell you been? What, you disappear? 
 Stop the presses give me couple seconds 
 Let tell my friends what's up with big brethren 
 New year new beard a new record 
 Made a few adjustments I want to discuss it 
 In a life of pain and sadness 
 Never would've guessed that a taste of success 
 Would've been the first time I ever got depressed 
 I know I'm blessed I just couldn't adjust 
 In life all I ever knew how to do is fight 
 Scrapped on the playground fighting for the mic 
 Trying to build a life with an insane wife 
 Fighting for a little bit of time in the light 
 Then I got a daughter a car and house 
 No one left to fight with but myself 
 Gained a lot of weight wasn't thinking about my health 
 Maybe the music I'm making could help 
 I can't drive 'cause this albino shit 
 Told you I was legally blind that's legit 
 I ain't want Ant to have to come scoop the kid 
 So I bought a crib a couple blocks from his 
 That's the greatest friend I ever had 
 Like a brother to me a borderline dad 
 Maybe making a record will get me on track 
 Help fix whatever's wrong with my head 
 I jumped back in the basement at once 
 Made the album Us in a couple of months 
 But I can't lie to y'all I felt lost 
 Energy I brought might've been a bit off 
 Couple great moments though of course 
 Babygirl Puppy Love and The Travelers 
 I toured two years off that album 
 Was on the road ten months out of one of them 
 Did the globe with my brother BK 
 My life coach slash DJ 
 Literally been with me since day one 
 Had a lot of hard times had a lot of fun 
 Long story short he got hell of a wife 
 Catastrophe damn near ended her life 
 Brought our wifeys out to Hawaii 
 These fuckers got pregnant on Waikiki 
 He said "I need to talk to you Ali 
 This is what you were born to do, but not me" 
 So after Soundset two thousand and ten 
 Say goodbye to my Deejay but not my friend 
 My career ain't stop it just grew 
 I rock (ed) the bells and Glastonbury too 
 Close enough to smell Beyonce's perfume 
 But it just ain't the same without dude 
 Couldn't slow me down no lord 
 Stayed on the planes and the busses and cars 
 Brought a young DJ into the squad 
 Sucker quit on me 'cause I toured too hard "Wah" 
 On to the next one 
 Then me and Ant had trouble connecting 
 If I was here then he was always there 
 Touring or recording with Atmosphere 
 What the hell's goin' on with my career 
 Within a year my team disappeared 
 Got a phone call on the 4th of July 
 My dad died, he committed suicide 
 Shit should've been there for him 
 Had to fly home from Europe to bury him 
 I'm sorry, I need a minute 
 Bismillah...) All right, listen 
 Trying to hold this marriage together 
 But me and my baby barely see each other 
 I'm in France with the fans taking pictures 
 She's with the kids making dinner doing dishes 
 She ain't got to worry 'bout me screwing other 
 But that ain't enough to make a woman feel precious 
 If we don't start to intersecting 
 We got no choice but grow in different directions, damn 
 I got that phone call again 
 You know the kind you never want to get 
 Mikey's mom couldn't get a hold of him 
 And found him dead in his apartment 
 Just drowning in tears 
 Probably won't get over that in all my years 
 I'll remember forever 
 A day later boarded a plane to Mecca 
 And the next month changed my life 
 Listening to God in the holy sites 
 Inklings I had all my life 
 Suddenly presented themselves in plain sight 
 Any doubts I had about the mic 
 And whether or not what I write is right 
 Fell out of sight like the tears on the floor 
 Now I'm going harder than I ever did before 
 Got a couple of beat tapes from Jake 
 Genuine dude and his music is great 
 I told Zach to hold my tour dates 
 Roll the tape I got something to say 
 So, I'm gonna go make this album. Let me start it off right though
