I used to think I hated this place 
 Couldn't wait to tell the president straight to his face 
 But lately I changed, nowadays I embrace it all 
 Beautiful ideals and amazing flaws 
 Got to care enough to give a testament 
 'Bout the deeply depressing mess we're in 
 It's home so we better make the best of it 
 I wanna make this country what it says it is 
 Still dream in the vividest living colour 
 No matter how many times my love been smothered 
 Who's ever above us won't just let us suffer 
 All of this struggling got to amount to something 
 This is a letter to my countrymen 
 Especially those my age and younger than 
 We're up against an ugly trend 
 Everybody's hustling don't nobody touch their friends 
 No group singing and dancing 
 No anthem nobody holds hands, and 
 Instead they give a hand held 
 And make you shoulder life's burden by your damn self 
 One thing that can't be debated 
 Power never changed on it's own you got to make it 
 That's why community is so sacred 
 That's the symbol that we make when we raise fists 
 Sooner or later 
 We don't really like to talk about the race thing 
 The whole grandparents used to own slaves thing 
 Pat ourselves on the back in February 
 Looking at pictures of Abe Lincoln and the great King 
 But the real picture's much more embarrassing 
 We're still not even close to really sharing things 
 The situation of oppressed people 
 Shows what we feel it means to be a human being 
 What does it mean to be American? 
 I think the struggle to free is our inheritance 
 And if we say it how it really is 
 We know our lily skin still give us privilege 
 Advantages given to the few 
 That are built into the roots of our biggest institutions 
 That's the truth in life we got to choose 
 Do I fight in the movement or think I'm entitled to it 
 This is not a practice life 
 This is the big game we got to attack it right 
 Each one of us is headed for the grave 
 This old crooked world won't be saved by the passive type 
 This is a letter to my countrymen 
 Not from a Democrat or a Republican 
 But one among you that's why you call me brother 
 Ain't scared to tell you we're in trouble 'cause I love you 
 They tell me I'm a dreamer, they ridicule 
 They feel defeated, old, bitter, and cynical 
 Excuse me but I see it from a different view 
 I still believe in what a driven few could really do 
 I know that the masses want to sleep 
 And they would just rather hear me rapping to the beat 
 But I want to pass this planet to my son 
 A little better than it was when they handed it to me 
 So I wrote a letter to my countrymen 
 I'll be happy if it only reaches one of them 
 Reporting live A-L-I, your brother 
 Mourning in America, dreaming in colour 
 My dear Brother Ali, 
 I think you know deep down in your soul that 
 Something, something just ain't right. 
 You don't want to be just well adjusted to injustice 
 And well adapted to indifference. You want to be 
 A person with integrity who leaves a mark on the world. 
 People can say when you go that you left the world 
 Just a little better than you found it. I understand. I want 
 To be like that too.
