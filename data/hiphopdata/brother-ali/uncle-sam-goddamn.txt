The name of this song is "Uncle Sam Goddamn" 
 It's a show tune, but the show ain't been written for it yet 
 We gonna see if Tony Jerome and the band can maybe work this shit out for me 
 Straighten me out right quick 
 I like it so far, man 
 Yeah 
 Come on, let's go 
 Welcome to the United Snakes 
 Land of the Thief, Home of the Slave 
 Grand imperial guard 
 Where the dollar is sacred and proud 
 Let's do this shit for real, come on now 
 Smoke and mirrors, stripes and stars 
 Stoning for the cross in the name of God 
 Bloodshed, genocide, rape and fraud 
 Writ into the pages of the law, good lord 
 The cold continent latchkey child 
 Ran away one day and started acting foul 
 King of where the wild things are, daddy's proud 
 Cause the Roman Empire done passed it down 
 Imported and tortured a workforce 
 And never healed the wounds or shook the curse off 
 Now the grown up Goliath nation 
 Holding open auditions for the part of David, can you feel it? 
 Nothing can save you, you question the reign 
 You get rushed in and chained up 
 Fists raised but I must be insane 
 'Cause I can't figure a single goddamn way to change it 
 But welcome to the United Snakes 
 Land of the Thief, Home of the Slave 
 The grand imperial guard 
 Where the dollar is sacred and power is god 
 Welcome to the United Snakes 
 Land of the Thief, Home of the Slave 
 The grand imperial guard 
 Where the dollar is sacred and power is god 
 All must bow to the fat and lazy 
 The fuck you obey me and why do they hate me, who me 
 Only two generations away from the 
 World's most despicable slavery trade 
 Pioneered so many ways to degrade a human being 
 That it can't be changed to this day 
 Legacy so ingrained in the way that we think 
 We no longer need chains to be slaves 
 Lord, it's a shameful display 
 The overseers even got raped along the way 
 Cause the children can't escape from the pain 
 And they born with the poisonous hatred in their veins 
 Try and separate a man from his soul 
 You only strengthen him and lose your own 
 But shoot that fucker if he walk near the throne 
 Remind him that this is my home (now I'm gone) 
 Welcome to the United Snakes 
 Land of the Thief, Home of the Slave 
 The grand imperial guard 
 Where the dollar is sacred and power is god 
 Welcome to the United Snakes 
 Land of the Thief, Home of the Slave 
 The grand imperial guard 
 Where the dollar is sacred 
 Hold up, gimme one right here, hold up 
 You don't give money to the bums 
 On the corner with a sign, bleeding from their gums 
 Talking about you don't support a crackhead 
 What you think happens to the money from your taxes? 
 Shit, the government's an addict 
 With a billion dollar a week kill-brown-people habit 
 And even if you ain't on the front line 
 When massa yell crunch time, you right back at it 
 You ain't look at how you hustling backwards 
 At the end of the year add up what they subtracted 
 Three out of twelve months your salary 
 Paid for that madness, man that's sadness 
 What's left? Get a big assed plasma 
 To see where they made Dan Rather point the damn camera 
 Only approved questions get answered 
 Now stand your ass up for that national anthem 
 Welcome to the United Snakes 
 Land of the Thief, Home of the Slave 
 The grand imperial guard 
 Where the dollar is sacred and power is god 
 Welcome to the United Snakes 
 Land of the Thief, Home of the Slave 
 The grand imperial guard 
 Where the dollar is sacred and power is god
