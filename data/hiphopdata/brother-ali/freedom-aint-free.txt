Ain't no where to run to 
 There ain't nothing here for free 
 If I don't like my life I gut it and rebuild it 
 Fuck it, keep nothing but God and my children 
 I kill the devil wherever he resides 
 Even if he hiding in me he got to die 
 I killed little Jason he was only fifteen 
 Sewed his good traits together, made Ali 
 Filled his lungs with the Koran until he breathe 
 Let him walk but kept him on a short leash 
 Here he stand now, seventeen year old man-child 
 Ain't ask nobody for a muh-fuckin' hand out 
 He trying to carry heaven on his back 
 Jumped the broom with a stranger, he ain't never look back 
 What he know about how the world spin? 
 Bless his heart he a virgin, never even had a girlfriend 
 Want to be a man so bad that he can taste it 
 His family fell apart and he's tryin' to replace it 
 You'll find in him a heart that is second to none 
 But I know old soul that his lessons ain't done so 
 I stand willing to kill him again 
 If to grow he got to shed his skin then let it be done 
 (Chorus/Hook) 
 Ain't no where to run to 
 There ain't nothing here for free 
 See what I see and know that freedom ain't free lord 
 Ain't no where to run to 
 There ain't nothing here for free 
 You'll see what I see and know that freedom ain't free 
 One half of all the two-leggeds on the scene are too timid to dream 
 'Cause failure is far too depressing it would seem 
 So they take what's given 
 That's your decision, I just don't consider that livin' 
 Shit, if I'mma die whether or not I try 
 I might as well let the dice fly 
 I'm hot knife through butter in the night sky 
 It shouldn't take a genius to see this hunger in my eye 
 So I use blood and sweat to butter my bread 
 'Cause this cold world couldn't give a fuck if I'm fed 
 I ain't curled up in my bed 
 If I don't set the world ablaze trust it ain't 'cause of nothing I did 
 Listen, I don't think God's obligated to touch you 
 If your ass would rather live in shit than work a shovel 
 I refuse to let the sun set on me again 
 Till the end I'm a one man army, friend 
 (Chorus/Hook) 
 Ain't no where to run to 
 There ain't nothing here for free 
 See what I see and know that freedom ain't free lord 
 Ain't no where to run to 
 There ain't nothing here for free 
 You'll see what I see and know that freedom ain't free 
 Ain't no where to run to 
 There ain't nothing here for free 
 See what I see and know that freedom ain't free lord 
 Ain't no where to run to 
 There ain't nothing here for free
