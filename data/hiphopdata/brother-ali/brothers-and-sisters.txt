Brothers and sisters 
 The world we share is filled with such despair 
 And such pain 
 We're a people at odds with our very own selves 
 The rich neglect the poor 
 The young resent the old 
 We're divided by race, divided by religion 
 Our politicians rob us and our leaders fail us 
 I think it's safe to say that we are our only hope 
 Our speaker tonight is a soldier in the war for love 
 He carries with him a message of true hope and true peace 
 I pray that you will listen with open hearts and open minds 
 Brothers and sisters 
 Put your hands together and welcome Brother Ali
