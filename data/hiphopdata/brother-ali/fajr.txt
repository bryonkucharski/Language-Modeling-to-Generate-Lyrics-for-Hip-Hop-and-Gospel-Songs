People ain't eating they say the reason 
 Resources depleted for the defense 
 I'm offended by it these authentic liars 
 Should've been retired let me identify them 
 You'll never get me quiet my people been inspired 
 I'm the little fire flickering within the riot 
 Feel it vibrate shake awake sleeping giant 
 Keep them vibrant and vital and reenergize them 
 Our time's arriving our shine is blinding 
 They cry we're violent demonize it 
 Guys on the wring side of right find us frightening 
 Pray lightning strike twice ice on their eyelids 
 Isis Osiris Christ in his likeness 
 Day of resurrection bring life to the lifeless 
 Tear the wall down pull a crown of a tyrant 
 Rebuild gentrify the planet for the righteous 
 He who sacrifices for the greater good 
 Elevate them where they should to the title of your highness 
 Only tribe surviving is the pious 
 United by the mighty human life tie that bind us 
 Hunger find kindness minds find refinement 
 The sightless guided by the blind are the blindest 
 We read the signs inscribed in the horizon 
 Bright yellow shot through the night time fajr 
 Oh thank you master for my soul 
 Lord hold me close don't let me go 
 Oh thank you master for my soul 
 Lord hold me close don't let me go 
 The long suffering long for relief 
 Hard working meek still drowning in grief 
 Houses are seized and they tossed in the street 
 The orphans of greed in a culture of deceit 
 Strong hunt the weak and the poverty steep 
 Wages dropping beneath yet the cost still increase 
 Officers deep keep force of police 
 The four headed beast wild all off it's leash 
 Hard hearted beast with a jaw full of meat 
 Engulfed in a feast while you starve at his feet 
 He toss you the least little portion of a piece 
 To the floor and expect you to rejoice when you eat 
 Survival can seem the impossible feat 
 But you roll up your sleeves and you sow all your seeds 
 Toil in the soil but you're not allowed to reap 
 So you toss and you scream like a horrible dream 
 Woke out your sleep got you forced to your feet 
 Feel the pulse of the people in your heart when it beat 
 The vultures they keep bringing halt to your peace 
 Pull your sword out the sheath keep the wolves off of the sheep 
 Oh thank you master for my soul 
 Lord hold me close don't let me go 
 Oh thank you master for my soul 
 Lord hold me close don't let me go
