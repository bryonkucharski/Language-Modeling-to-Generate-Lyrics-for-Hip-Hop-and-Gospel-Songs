I stand tall I raise my fists 
 I pray all this pain might lift 
 I don't want to die tonight 
 But I can't live another day like this 
 Verse One: 
 The first time I ever broke the law 
 Was just being born in a zone that's controlled by y'all 
 A foreigner in my own damn home land 
 Made me a sixteen year old grown man 
 I was aged by the pain that I saw 
 Outside my front door was the front line of a war 
 Shots gets fired, I cry on the floor 
 Underneath my bed tryin' to hide from it all 
 I try to recall the first time that I saw 
 Someone close to me die and my mind starts to draw 
 A blank 
 Far to many of us die 
 Genocide it's a genocide 
 And our enemies will never be satisfied 
 Until not even our memories survive 
 It feels like they got the whole world on their side 
 And the story of my people will never reach your eyes 
 But understand one damn thing I can't run 
 I don't care where the Goliath got his strength from 
 I'll rush your tank with not even a hand gun 
 Only a rock from the land that I stand on 
 Verse Two: 
 That's the law that I break when I breathe 
 The blood of my people races through me 
 I will never back down, I can not flee 
 Would rather die on my feet then to live on my knees 
 Adorning the soldier uniform I was born in 
 I did not choose the war I was drawn in 
 If I been called to be a martyrs end 
 I'm standing on Heaven's front door with a grin 
 Saying please let me in 
 Greet me as a friend 
 I did not believe I would breathe free again 
 Lord have mercy on my soul 
 I was desperate and I had people to defend 
 I'm the slave that drowned on the middle passage 
 I'm chief Sitting Bull at the hand of a savage 
 John Brown standing, both guns blasting 
 Crying freedom, something must happen 
 If I'm the only weapon that I have 
 Then I'm standing with a bomb strapped to my abdomen 
 Eyes full of water 
 God please forgive me 
 My people must one day live free
