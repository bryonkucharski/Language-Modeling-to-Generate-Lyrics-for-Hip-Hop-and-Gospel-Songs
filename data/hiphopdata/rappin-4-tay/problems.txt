No I can't run, I can't hide from all this pressure, 
 If I sell out that means I'm copping to a lesser charge, 
 And whenever there's a will baby, there's a way, 
 Each one teach one, I always say, 
 The murder rate is rising, soceity ain't scaring me, 
 Life is like a puzzle, ain't no telling when they'll bury be, 
 They wanna tell me how to live, 
 But I got dues to pay, now how much money you gon' give, 
 For my PG and me bill, 'cause it's a week late, 
 Leave the hustle alone, fool, don't procastanate, 
 'Cause I'm a get mine, and that's the way I was taught, 
 Fool, now what you thought, 
 That I was born and raised in a big house, 
 While you would sleep up in the bed, I slept on the couch, 
 I tried to study, but was often interrupted, 
 Because the nieghborhood I'm from is so corrupted, 
 Rats and roaches creeping through the cracks in my walls, 
 While my folks down the street breaking plain and ball, 
 Trying to count as much as they can count is like hell, 
 Is kind of hard being raised off up in the cell, 
 Get on your own, and get you some bizness, black, 
 Stay sucker-free, and by all means, watch your back, 
 You ain't gotta listen, but take it from your boy 4-Tay, 
 Fool, you think you pormised another day?, 
 Each piece of life is like a puzzle, can you slove 'em, 
 Stress'll drive you crazy tryin' to deal with these problems, 
 Problems, problems, how you gon' solve 'em, 
 Man, I'm going crazy trying to deal with these problems, 
 Each and every day on these streets, game is getting sicker, 
 Thicker than a King-size snicker, 
 And I know who's got the plug, don't need no witness, 
 Cause your bizness ain't everybody elses bizness, 
 Snitchers, and gothams, and gangstas, they're so keniving, 
 In 1995, only the strong will survive and, 
 Everytime I open up somethin', somebody wants some, 
 So I could be broke, all on my lonesome, 
 Too many critics, too many debators, 
 And when they don't hire us, that makes me think they hate us, 
 But that's just anothre problem pushing through my brain, 
 That wouldn't change no matter how much I complained, 
 How would you care if I was living on welfare, 
 You act like you gon' move me and my family elsewhere, 
 Allow me to make this conversation more concrete, 
 Too many formalitys, and I find that so obsolete, 
 But I'm a keep striving, 'cause it couldn't get no worse, 
 Ain't robbing no banks or snatching nobody's purse, 
 I finally made me a profit, so now I can really chill, 
 Check my mailbox, Oh, too soon, there's my phone bill 
 Trying to look up for number 1, and that's my mother, 
 If it ain't one thing fly, it's another, 
 Each piece of life is like a puzzle, can you solve 'em, 
 Stress'll drive you crazy when your dealing with these problems, 
 Problems, problems, how you gon' solve 'em, 
 Man I'm going crazy tryin' to deal with these problems, 
 Each piece of life is like a puzzle, can you solve 'em, 
 Stress'll drive you crazy trying to deal with these problems, 
 Problems, problems, how you gon' solve 'em, 
 Man I'm going crazy trying to deal with these problems, 
 Problems, problems, how you gon' solve 'em, 
 I'm a handle mine, 
 Problems, problems, how you gon' solve 'em, 
 Take 'em one at a time
