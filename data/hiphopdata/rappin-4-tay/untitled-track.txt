Me and my homies we tighter than a glove 
 Chop a lot of game is how we do it at the Playaz Club 
 Check the fool or kick it in the tub 
 'Cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club 
 I got a hoe named Real de Real 
 She got a buddy named SP-12 now you know the deal 
 We getz freaky in the studio late night 
 That's why the beats that you hear are comin' real tight 
 Somethin' to roll to somethin' to stroll to 
 If you's a playa in the game this will hold you 
 Mo money mo money for the bank roll 
 Stick to the script don't slip in the nine-fo 
 A lot of fools put salt in the game 
 Till these women get the notion that they runnin' the game huh 
 I run my own and I'm my own self person 
 No respect make the situation worse then 
 Fillmoe, H.P., and Sunnydale 
 There's a playaz club everywhere you dwell 
 Lakeview, P.H., and Army Street 
 A different part of town a different kind of freak 
 I just wiggle my toes on a mink rug 
 And press play on the remote at the playaz club 
 (More champagne, Mr. Forte?) 
 From day one I had to get my money right 
 Me, Fly, and Franky J we took a airplane flight huh 
 They wanted to hear a rap I said all right bet 
 We dropped the beat and grabbed the mic then they wrote a check 
 A few G's for the pocket no hesitation 
 Took a flight back to the Golden State and 
 Shops made orders from a whole new capital 
 Words out 4-Tay's out rappable 
 Don't need a Glock but I bought one just in case 
 Suckas try to stop me from pursuin my paper chase 
 'Cause the chase is on because it don't stop 
 I got the beat and got the rap you make the Glock pop 
 So treacherous suckas couldn't sweat this on a bad day 
 By the way just in case you never heard 
 Rappin' 4-Tay I'm on the smooth tip 
 Never trippin' off them suckas poppin' off at the lip 
 I pop the top off the drank and we can roll some dank bro 
 Leave the gat at the house bring some dominoes 
 Take off your shoes relax and get a body rub 
 And shoot your mackin at these women at the playaz club 
 You can't resist it but don't get it twisted 
 V.I.P. that means the number's not listed 
 Membership is based on clout and how you carry yourself 
 Now homie what you all about? 
 I stack paper and kick it with the O.G's 
 Some got a nine-to-five some drink a lot of keys 
 You can learn a whole lot from a playa 
 Some of these playas make a damn good rhyme sayer 
 A lot of people get a misconception 
 And start driftin in the wrong direction 
 Miss goody two sure see you later 
 I ain't got time you ain't nothin' but a playa hater 
 I'd rather kick it with the crew in Arizona 
 They chop game like we do in California 
 Another show another flow a new bank account 
 But cash money comes in large amounts 
 So get your membership but never slip to lame fast 
 Or else us and fly will have to tap that ass 
 And drop you to the ground and make your knees scrub 
 It's just an everyday thang at the playaz club 
 Me and my homies we tighter than a glove 
 Chop a lot of game is how we do it at the playaz club 
 Check the fool or kick it in the tub 
 'Cause we kick much ass at the Sucka Free club
