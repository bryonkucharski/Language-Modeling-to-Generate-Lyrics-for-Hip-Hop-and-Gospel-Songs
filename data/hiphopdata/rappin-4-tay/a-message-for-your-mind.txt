Ain't nobody gettin' no younger, man, we're just gettin' older and 
 We need to get bolder than bold as we've ever been 
 Our reference as Africans, where our folks sittin' 
 They cryin out laughin' 
 The game is all you know so you in it to win it, right? 
 Trippin', a gang o' bullets, decided to find a fight 
 Life is scattered in directions, brotherly connections 
 Misguided youth driftin in the wrong direction 
 I hope for the best and say a prayer and keep steppin 
 Too many kids they own an automatic weapon 
 A lot of them wanna go home instead of hangin' out 
 It's kinda hard when you're parents' straight smoked out 
 For you fisters, stay prepared for the up and coming 
 Get all you can while you can and result to something 
 You be surprised with this talent that we hold 
 But we forget and go sick outta control 
 A lotta homies to die, they left a true lesson 
 Or fill your soul that I love, this another blessing 
 You want funk, it used to be bing-bing 
 To the dome, but nah now it's really on 
 Go out back, what? To just to be reputable? 
 Hope you don't lose your life, fools are goin' federal 
 I'm goin' forward, showin 'em up like a pimp 
 And gettin' the truck, you can sell each other profit 
 Don't let police try to grab you by your shirt collar 
 You witta black man, who understands black power 
 Pipin hot, are you the bad brother? 
 I love to roll rhymes, see my homeboys stickin together 
 Stay focused 'cause there's too many blind 
 Blind to the purpose of life and that's a message for your mind 
 Tried the dope about a thousand times 
 So here's a message for your mind 
 (x4) 
 I once knew a man who couldn't read 
 He said "It ain't no thang cause 
 I graduated twice with the game I possess" 
 Bullet-proof vest to the chest 
 But when his kids needed help to prepare for a test 
 It was stress 'cause Pops ain't achieving in academics 
 It's true indeed, his problem is an epidemic 
 Who wanna work five long hard days through it? 
 And get tax, I guess somebody gotta do it 
 So take coke, rock it up brick-solid 
 Ain't nobody thinkin' about a checks up ??? wallet 
 Kids are growin' up with the train of thought 
 The motion the parents talk, the trip on the *?dopest bar?* 
 Now look at the man you fuck, he was as black as you 
 Sweated ya money, it wasn't funny so you did what'cha had to do 
 How many brothers will be taken out by another brother? 
 Give a talk show a whole lot to talk about 
 It's me and my microphone, it's you and your 9 
 And that's fine, well here's a message for your mind 
 The next verse is out for the chicks 
 Ho's are to be chosen, nightclub or taking flicks? 
 The homey might be roughy with a tandy-out Mercedes 
 Called a girl a 'female dog', well she's a lady 
 Run into the wrong one, a strong one, a smart man coast her 
 She pushed you to the left and turned her off when you approached her 
 You tripped and dissed her, you bashed the sister 
 And even when you drove off, you couldn't resist her 
 Solution:Better go, homey, leave her P 
 'Cause you know like I know there's plenty fish in the sea 
 There's more women in this world than men, for fact, I'm right 
 Just because she's superfine that doesn't mean that's your type 
 Briefcase, white shirt, tie and a sportscoat 
 A hella gold, ???, servin' ya friend's dough 
 Friends are friends then or friends come good friends 
 A helpin hand in understandin, wants to invite you in 
 Man's your best friend, boyfriend and girlfriend 
 It's like a soap opera in this world that we're living in 
 Misconception from a blink or a wink 
 He want to get married and all she want is a drink 
 But it really don't help when you supposed to be faithful 
 He bought you a boat load and paid for ya cases 
 Kept it comin', the brother went wrong for expecting some 
 Got knocked out by ya spouse, now ya started some 
 It seems strange but these fools are taking people out 
 For the woman that they love and truly care about 
 It's understandable, but will hurts when she's givin' in 
 Now was it reaaly worth a life sentence in the pen? 
 No get-back, nothin' but a jail song 
 A homey told ya that you're woman had it goin' on 
 Now ya stuck and she's on the prowl gettin' wined and dined 
 Damn, now that's a message for your mind 
 His pocket's fat and his dove is too. He huh
