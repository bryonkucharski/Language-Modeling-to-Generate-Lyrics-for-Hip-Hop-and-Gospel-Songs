(Feat. Master P) 
 (Intro: Master P (4-Tay)) 
 Whatsup Franky J (You know how we do it Bad Boy) 
 You think they ready for this Master P and 4-Tay hookup? 
 (I know they ain't ready baby) Ya heard me 
 (Yeah, OGs) We gonna show them how Gs do it 
 (Rag Top and No Limit) How playas do it 
 (Pop that shit P) 
 (Verse 1: Master P) 
 I started from the South, then I moved to the Bay 
 Got Gs and a house, got carrow and some hay 
 Them stalkers I be ballin 
 Fiends steady callin 
 Got 0s from Frisco, Texas, Dallas, to New Orleans 
 In the game I'm on top 
 No more runnin' from the cops 
 CDs and cassettes in plastic bags just like rocks 
 Big S on my Lex 
 Million dollar checks 
 Hotels and president suites, Alize, weed, and Moet 
 In the game to make scrilla, fuck being famous 
 Independent Black-owned like Andy and Amos 
 (Chorus: Mater P) 
 I'm a playa 4 life 
 A playa 4 life (uugghhh) 
 I'm a playa 4 life 
 (Verse 2: Rappin' 4-Tay) 
 Two bona-fide P-L-A-Y-As 
 Master P and Rappin' 4-Tay 
 From New Orleans ballin' back up to the Bay 
 We keeps shakin' and breakin' these suckas 
 True playas don't fuck with bustas 
 Its No Limit baby, them West Coast Bad Boyz 
 Best to check our tabloids 
 Ballin like Palo, can't have no fake bitches on my squad 
 I'm Rappin' 4-Tay ain't never made me none, givin' Southside playas props 
 Got more hoes than Swiss cheese - Nigga please 
 Once I pop these Ps on em 
 And get to stackin these Gs on 'em - 360 degrees on em 
 Rumblin and bubblin' 
 Done had enough of this so I'm strugglin' 
 Still roll with mobstaz, steak and lobsters, haters be buggin 
 But they feelin' me, I'm glistenin' 
 Hoes whistlin- this game so tight 
 Master P and Rappin' 4, playas for life 
 (Chorus x4: 4-Tay) 
 I'm a playa 4 life, a playa 4 life, a playa 4 life 
 (From the South to the West, playas keep your game tight) 
 (Break: 4-Tay) 
 Me and P from the 9-7 till the casket drop 
 No Limit and Rag Top 
 Keepin' 'em sprung like research monkeys, ya know? 
 I'm a playa 4 life 
 G status equals cabbage 
 And about that Ra Ra? 
 I tried to tell you mothafuckers but ya- ya wouldn't listen to me 
 Thought it wouldn't last, so take a blast 
 Best to get with me 
 Crazy, wanna knock me but can't stop me 
 Feds wanna lock me up 
 But I'ma keep stackin them presidents fool, ask me if I give a fuck 
 Gangstas mob to this 
 Playas ride to this 
 Dedicated to them hustlas late night stackin up on them grips 
 Gettin' cloudy-cloudy 
 Man, y'all so rowdy-rowdy 
 Much love to that playa Master P because he 'bout it-'bout it 
 (Chorus: Master P) 
 ('Bout it 'bout it) 
 'Cause we playas 4 life 
 Playas 4 life [x4] 
 Niggaz from the Bay and the South win right 
 'Cause we playas 4 life, playas 4 life 
 So when you run up on us playas, y'all haters think twice 
 'Cause we playas 4 life, playas 4 life (uugghh) 
 (Outro:Master P) 
 Nigga, playas 4 life, ya heard me? 
 Rappin' 4-Tay, Master P, big Franky J hookin it up baby 
 We signin off nigga, bout to jump on Delta nigga 
 Takin' trips all around the dizorld, I mean the wizorld nigga 
 Slangin that shit, cheddar cheese nigga 
 Even y'all haters buyin this shit nigga
