(Phone rings) 
 [Lady:] Ragtop records, may I help you? 
 [Fly:] Can I speak to Fo? 
 [Lady:] I moment please, he's around. 
 [4-Tay:] Yo, wassup? 
 [Fly:] Wassup, Fo? I know you finished that cut for the radio. 
 [4-Tay:] As a matter of fact Fly I just finished it baby boy, don't worry 
 About nothin', I'll be around. 
 (4-Tay) 
 Regardless if I'm chillin' backstage or on tour 
 With my homie Young Fly even Al B. Sure 
 Never hesitate to call me whenever I'm done 
 Cause homie I'm real and I'm always true to my loved ones 
 Too many wakes and funerals full of tears 
 You say there's something on your mind well here I'm all ears 
 Cause nobody thinking about the funk that you're choosin' it 
 A lot of my homies stuck in the pen for life for losin it 
 Call up your folks you keep thinkin' about home 
 Recorder keeps a peep and there's a block on the phone 
 And all of this is enough to make a brother's nerves bad 
 Reminds me of a sitution that I once had 
 Spent that spent this endless relentless tremendous women on my jock 
 And don't nobody mindin business 
 He say she say throwin' salt about it 
 And chooses to talk about you cause there's no one else to talk about 
 Talk about the show and the flow and all the clout 
 Then be real with yourself and talk about and turned it out 
 It's not hard to compete when his name is poppin' 
 A scared man can never win that's why I stay clockin 
 Fools be huffin and puffin don't wanna see me about nothin' I'm down 
 And if you ever need me Fly I'll be around 
 (Chorus: sampled from the Spinners "I'll Be Around) 
 Whenever you call me I'll be there 
 Whenever you want me I'll be there 
 Whenever you need me I'll be there 
 I'll be around 
 (Talking) 
 'Cause I'll be around you know I love you boy 
 Life ain't based on peaches and cream 
 This new generation lost a whole lot of dreams 
 Future doctors, producers and mothers 
 The list goes on but now we killin' our brothers 
 And if we killin' our brothers that means we're killin' our own kind 
 These kids is watchin now it goes to their mind 
 Rat tat a tat cause you got a gat 
 Then they want a gat you livin' like that? 
 Moms ain't cookin she worked the week straight 
 If anything she's the one that deserves a hot plate 
 The ghetto the ghetto ain't nothin' to dream about 
 Tryin' to get out now that's somethin' to think about 
 Fools might disagree but I'm a stay sucka free 
 Now I'm so black so strong they can't fade me 
 Blacks are blacks worst enemy there's still no remedy 
 You got me for a grip do you call yourself kin of me? 
 Jealousy envy I see it in your eyes 
 Tell me what's wrong with seeing a black man rise 
 I keep it funky it's pretty hard to miss it now is it explicit 
 A message for the mind and the moral of statistics 
 So I'm doin' what we call a roll call 
 Talkin' about the ones who won't rap then take a downfall 
 I spit the street life and then I go underground 
 You silly it's called versatility and I'll be around 
 (Talking) 
 Yeah all you bustas yeah I was down but I'll be around 
 Things are gettin' crucial you gotta exercise your mind 
 Or learn about life before you're left behind 
 But how you gonna get it right when you're not doin' right 
 When you get mad all you want is a gunfight 
 This tension causes a gang of madness 
 Now you want funk that results to sadness 
 Sadness results to a lot of revenge 
 And you're so called friends really ain't you're friends 
 So how do you know who you're able to trust 
 If you think about the past look what happened to us 
 I never trust no one I only trust myself 
 Or I would've been a victim like everyone else 
 In friendship or hardship whenever you need me 
 Just give me a call G I won't deceive thee 
 These fools be shakin best believe they're fakin 
 Just tryin' to get a grip of all the money you're makin' 
 This ain't race a mind is a terrible thing to waste 
 I drop the rap and J drops the bass 
 To the flow cause ain't nobody get with Fo 
 I'm a down young brother comin' straight outta Frisco 
 Droppin' a message out of love to your town 
 Love your brothers and sisters and I'll be around
