You see you never talk down on a player 
 I spray a to break to your knees 
 You best to say a prayer 
 Cause funk been a part of my life ever since the starting gate 
 Remember me and my nigga $hort Dog way back in '88 
 Broke them bitches down with some sexual healing 
 And man the town ain't been the same and don't fight the feeling 
 But now you new boy 
 Started off in this game on a accident 
 Copied another nigga's style 
 Punk don't let this rap shit get you broke off 
 Cause see it's potent like that ain't right 
 Find a maiden name for yourself but don't believe the hype 
 Fool who you think I was the dope of your producer 
 If it wasn't for them dogs and them hogs you wouldn't have a future 
 Now let me add that I could never be scarier 
 Rappin' fo' want to raise off in that Bay Area 
 Stickin' to dat ass like a hot bowl of grits 
 Hits on top of hits who you think started this shit 
 Never talk down on a playa 
 Unless you ready to be straight laid where there's a hater 
 Save a bitch in a minute for a nut 
 It's the funk when this dog got you fiendin' on this funk, Nigga 
 It's the funk when this dog got you fiendin' on this funk, Nigga 
 It's going down right now 
 California mackin' at its best 
 Somethin' for my niggas on the grind from the west 
 Cali is my home but its just like yours 
 Niggas love to get money while they fuck they whores 
 Hit all the parties and do the same old shit 
 Bitches gettin' broke 'cause the game don't quit 
 I had a flash back it was the Oakland Raiders at the Colliseum we ain't 
 Nothin' but playas 
 Diamonds glistenin' hoes whistlin' 
 Bitches know my name 'cause it's a natural thing 
 I had to bend the corna' 
 Really didn't bone her 
 Punk yooz a gona 
 Heard you was on a 
 Stick up mission triple beam in the kitchen 
 Never shot nobody but I'm damn sho' itchin' to blast you 
 'Cause in your dream you shot me then you woke up and found out you can't stop me 
 If buckin' 'em up fuckin' the mic be a crime 
 Best believe da police got a APB out on mine 
 Because I gots mo' disguises than that fool inspecta gadget 
 I'm not a witch but crystal ball let me have it, Ah 
 I seen playa hatin' way back from da gate 
 Now everybody want to be a P-L-A-why-A 
 While life to you self play da role wasn't a simp 
 Knowin' damn well your girl brought Shorty the pimp 
 Because they smile in ya face 
 And all the while them motherfuckas want to take ya place 
 That's right funky from da old school 
 Been doin' shows been comin' tight in studios 
 Songs on da radio interviews and laughs 
 Up at the mall signin' autographs 
 And ain't nothin' gonna change in '96 
 'Cause this pimp gotta mack all the finest bitches 
 And get paid from da game so they never talk down on a playas name 
 (Rappin' 4') 
 Bitch 
 4-Tay, Short Dog, and Breed like dis check me out 
 Member that runnin' back 
 Sayin' breedas hatin' you 
 Takin' you to anotha level nigga makin' you 
 We got plenty of hoes in the back screamin' okay 
 Who you fuckin' round wit, 4-Tay 
 Ice like T out to get paid 
 Short Dog bringin' hoes to the pimpery 
 I faded off this? 
 Niggas want to play me but plenty of bitches pay me 
 Over all I balls more and none test 
 I keep a gun and I put two off in a nigga's chest 
 And see coincide within the same heartbeat 
 That's right I give a motherfucka' five feet 
 Further information, I get inta meditation 
 I outta have yo ass shakin' 
 I conclude my calculation is
