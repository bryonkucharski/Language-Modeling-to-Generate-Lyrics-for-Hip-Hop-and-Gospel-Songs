This, is our fork in the road 
 Love's last episode 
 There's nowhere to go, oh no 
 You made your choice, now it's up to me 
 To bow out gracefully 
 Though you hold the key, but baby 
 Whenever you call me, I'll be there 
 Whenever you want me, I'll be there 
 Whenever you need me, I'll be there 
 I'll be around 
 I, knew just what to say 
 Now I found out today 
 That all the words had slipped away, but I know 
 There's always a chance 
 A tiny spark remains, yeah 
 And sparks turn into flames 
 And love can burn once again, but I know you know 
 Whenever you call me, I'll be there 
 Whenever you want me, I'll be there 
 Whenever you need me, I'll be there 
 I'll be around... yeah 
 Whenever you call me, I'll be there 
 Whenever you want me, I'll be there 
 Even if I have to call, I'll be there 
 I'll be around 
 Just call me at home, I'll be there 
 I'll never leave you alone, I'll be there 
 Just call out your name you know I know you know 
 I'll be around
