Line for line, you gotta get it done 
 Little at a time, Zen approach 
 Gradually, I'ma get mine 
 Black Thought from the legendary 5th don 
 You wasn't payin' attention 
 I'm henchin to hit the entrance 
 Trenchin it was no means to intervention 
 A dollar bill would make a hundred ten yen, son 
 How much you willing ta sacrifice ta win, huh? 
 I personally I paid mines 
 And then some climbed up an inch bit at a time 
 Now who's the zen one 
 If not self whom else can you depend on? 
 Friends gonna say it's all right and probably they been wrong 
 I got them battlefield dents in my armor 
 A twitch from the drama 
 The trees and bad karma 
 But still I'm precision, procedure performer 
 We operate every night, and leave in the morning 
 Ta getchoo high as a kyte's the reason you want it 
 It's like a direct flight from freezin ta burnin hot shit 
 The audience fiend fa this fix 
 And KRUSH come wit the guillotine fa this mix, like... 
 Line for line, you gotta get it done 
 Little at a time, Zen approach

 Black Thought from the legendary 5th don 
 Yo, who got they fingers on the carousel locked in position 
 It got to be my man, the turntable tactician 
 You all at hush 'cause I ain't try to listen 
 You wanna feel its realness, the Rik's spittin' 
 It gotcha head split your eyes can't stop twitchin 
 The only thing that you can do is rock the rhythm 
 Don't put 'em down 
 Cause see the world we're at now 
 See me lickin' rhymes, rappin' like a five of rounds 
 And a you now ain't true to find the zenfinite sound and a 
 The revolution poppin' off right now 
 I make you rase your fist, raisin up right 
 Raise your fist that busted the flag like blah 
 The fuck boy nigga's trying ta keep it on the hush 
 But Black Thought spittin' cause the people want a rush your feel 
 It's what the audience fiend fa this fix 
 And KRUSH come wit the guillotine fa this mix lie... 
 Line for line, you gotta get it done 
 Little at a time, Zen approach

 Black Thought from the legendary 5th don 
 Yo, I got the renissance, turn of the century 
 Choked + I'ma do the people right 
 If y'all gimme the vote 
 Finna ride, hang 'em high 
 KRUSH, gimmie the rope 
 See all them porcelain chin 
 Niggas gettin' 'em broke 
 One at a time, na let's focus on who the don 
 When your blade's sharp as mine 
 People want you to rhyme 
 They want you ta spill 
 Fa me ain't nuttin for real 
 Me and my man runnin' Japan 
 We're tough on the wheel 
 He blow ya mind like bustin' the steel 
 I give the crowd something ta feel 
 The sound got the power to heal 
 It's like the Green Mile, now I need an hour to chill 
 A 1/4 of a kill ta burn while patrillin the field 
 I'm puttin' rappers out cold 
 I done rap from Tokyo to the North Pole 
 Whenever my man program the passcode 
 Drummers se the 5th 
 And yo, KRUSH come wit a gullotine fa this mix, like... 
 Line for line, you gotta get it done 
 Little at a time, Zen approach
