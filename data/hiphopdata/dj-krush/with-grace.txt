Reason 
 Is there any reason 
 Why my heart must now understand 
 We had the fire so many times 
 Changes like the season 
 Convinces me 
 That we've come to an end 
 But your love was undescribable 
 Woo ooh, woo ooh, woo ooh, woo ooh 
 Woo ooh, woo ooh, woo ooh, woo ooh 
 And as I watch I see before my eyes 
 The truth is my reality 
 My emotions are high 
 And I'm at the risk of falling again 
 Right now everything's on the line 
 Being alone is not what I prefer 
 But I've got to face this feeling 
 With grace 
 I will step aside 
 But if you're in need 
 Holler and I'll be round 
 Holler, holler, holler 
 Holler, holler, holler 
 Please don't try 
 To make me less than I am 
 Let's not drag it out anymore 
 With grace 
 I will gladly remove myself 
 With grace 
 I'm all too willing 
 'Cause being alone is not what I prefer 
 But I've got to face this feeling 
 With grace 
 I will step aside 
 But if you're in need 
 Holler and I'll be round 
 With grace 
 I will step aside 
 But if you're in need 
 Holler and I'll be round 
 Holler, holler, holler 
 Holler, holler, holler 
 With grace 
 I will step aside 
 But if you're in need 
 Holler and I'll be round 
 But if you're in need 
 Holler and I'll be round 
 But if you're in need 
 Holler and I'll be round
