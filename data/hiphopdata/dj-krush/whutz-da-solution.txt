Whut'z going on, says Marvin Gaye 
 I don't know but it'z even trifa than it was I your day 
 I feel grief, but at the same time I'm mad enough to catch beef 
 Becauz catz be camouflagin' 
 Actin' like everything iz everything 
 But ready to throw a Tomahawk in ya back 
 Smilin', jokin' and laughin' but profilin' 
 Playin' da role like nothing's happening 
 Letting da atin' control ya soul 
 Jealousy iz festerin', bubblin' 
 Ready to boil a whole persona 
 And lifestyle iz turmoil 
 Whut'z wit ya grill? 
 Were you suckin on a spoiled lemon? 
 I'm tellin' you envy is deadly, look what happened to John Lennon 
 It's sad, dat'z why my melon iz swellin' 
 Jealousy iz a mutha, envy is anotha 
 What can we do? What'z da solution? 
 I don't know, but I got a few suggestions 
 It might be helpful or maybe not 
 But I feel like fishburne in school dayze 
 Stop, we must come together 
 Cauz if not society will rot 
 Becauz my brother iz everyone 
 No matter race, color or creed 
 I'm more than happy to congratulate 
 Not the hate 
 Jealousy iz just like an earthquake 
 It shakes, rattles and rolls ya way of thinking 
 Mad at a cat without meeting, angry at ya man 
 Becauz he'z seeking something better 
 But da thought gives you chills like da cost of an iceberg sweater 
 Why can't we all get along? 
 That's a question we should be askin' ourselves 
 Listen to this song 
 It's like whutever you do 
 Jealousy surround you 
 Everything I said iz true from verse 1 to verse 2 
 Then Sinsta came through to put hiz piece of mind in it 
 This hatred we got to end it 
 Send it to a far place like space 
 Never hesitate to support your fellow man 
 Brother, sister, spouse or mate 
 Take a lil' advice from me 
 A true to heart M. C. who been encounterin' envy 
 Overcoming da fake snakes and unfriendly 
 Rememberin' these I da struggle 
 We need to make a difference in da 21st Century 
 Or itz trouble 
 Jealousy iz a mutha, envy is anotha 
 What can we do? What'z da solution?
