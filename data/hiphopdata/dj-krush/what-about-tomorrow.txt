What about the youths 
 What about tomorrow 
 What about the truth 
 Is it bread or sorrow 
 What about the youths

 It's so hard to see what's happening today 
 To see my brothers and sister die that way 
 I would like to take a trip to the palace of the king 
 Just to share what's on my mind for a brighter day 
 What about the youths 
 What about tomorrow 
 What about the truth 
 Is it bread or sorrow 
 What about the youths 
 What about tomorrow 
 What about the truth 
 Is it bread or sorrow 
 So much division on the walls of religiosity 
 So much confusions that we cannot see 
 Ole fascism gains poverty 
 No more bombing, no more shooting, let the children be 
 What about the youths 
 What about tomorrow 
 What about the truth 
 Is it bread or sorrow 
 What about the youths 
 What about tomorrow 
 What about the truth 
 Is it bread or sorrow 
 The pain is so hard that we can't feel it 
 So let my people free 
 How many cry, how many die, we see 
 Let JAH children be 
 What about the youths 
 What about tomorrow 
 What about the truth 
 Is it bread or sorrow 
 What about the youths 
 What about tomorrow 
 What about the truth

 Change hatred for a brighter tomorrow 
 Just to see the peace among each other 
 There's no war love can't conquer 
 We should all be our brother's keeper 
 What about the youths 
 What about tomorrow 
 What about the truth 
 Is it bread or sorrow 
 What about the youths 
 What about tomorrow 
 What about the truth 
 Is it bread or sorrow

 How many cry, how many die, we see 
 Let JAH children be
