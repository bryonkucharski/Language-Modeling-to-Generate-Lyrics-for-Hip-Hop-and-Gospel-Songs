The end of the Century of Destruction 
 Various joys reflected at the commencement of the New Century 
 Dreams expanding, tell tales of future 
 Then appeared Gokuraku-cho, flying down 
 Black shadow gives a cold laugh 
 History of genocide repeated itself 
 Syas and does of egoists 
 Brainwashing by media 
 Blinded mass psychology 
 Even now, broken souls wander in the air 
 It might happen tomorrow 
 Impulse of destruction stems out of solitude and the air of catastrophe 
 Trusth of madness that lies behind smiles 
 Fading them out is unacceptable 
 Extinction of bodies, and murder of souls 
 Halt, look back, think 
 And proceed the Ended Century 
 What's waiting ahead is...
