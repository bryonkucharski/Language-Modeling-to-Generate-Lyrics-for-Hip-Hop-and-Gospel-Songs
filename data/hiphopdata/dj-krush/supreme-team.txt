Get low 
 Apc 
 I turned frosty to keep the grime off 
 Keep my lines staggered the braggart that stopped 
 Traffic with patterns that cracked cabbages 
 Back in the crack labor (tory) 
 Spit this traum flip this traum 
 Respond it's like I got a bomb tatted on my arm 
 Um who run lyrics like h-prism 
 That's refracted back the pat pterodactyl 
 The solution will unwrap you 
 It's capital A-P-see / walk with me through the 
 Blocks and blocks of coma 
 I spit trauma 
 Spark a lighter or a flare 
 I rep faculty actually 
 By my side not back of since back in the 
 Pac tragedy 
 His majesty 
 See when you see me your seeing 
 The supreme team ... 
 I got the convo's locked 
 Boxed in like a condo 
 Boas doing mambo 
 The script I talk I walk 
 So when spit it I ridded the wicked 
 Fuck with stitches fuck a fit 
 I throw a hospital 
 Its twisted 
 M (dot) s-a-y-y-i-d ese' 
 With essays 
 Lion king 
 Novel broadway 
 Leave you les miserables 
 Got the odd job messy 
 High noon blue jet spray 
 International aka address jfk 
 Bananas at the spot where I stay 
 Vanilla dutches cats is on crutches 
 Forty tracks with the axe that pats you back like 
 Hey 
 See when you see me your seeing 
 The supreme team...
