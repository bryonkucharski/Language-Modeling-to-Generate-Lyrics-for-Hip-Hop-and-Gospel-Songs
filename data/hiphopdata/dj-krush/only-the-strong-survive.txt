Yeah, DJ Krush in the house, the carmel kingpin CL Smooth and only the strong survive 
 Actual facts 
 The ghetto reacts to warfare 
 Real bullets miss you by your hair 
 Survival of the fittest 
 Hell for the three time losers 
 The prisoners of enemy manuvers 
 Hold down the fort 
 'Cause life is short enough to get it taken 
 Forsaken when your mental planes' breakin 
 Concealin' a 4 pound with every area 
 We surround 'cause clown 
 I get down for my crown 
 Take it to the streets for the 
 Honour and respect 
 Connect the lethal 
 Plus my young guns are unbeatable 
 Aiding and abetting the foul 
 Is a violation 
 That's why my retalliation 
 Is premeditation 
 The invitation 
 Is to run with a crew you can't do 
 And too great to infiltrate from a 
 Nickel plate 
 I state 
 This be the illest ever known on a rush 
 Swervin' with the krush 
 Slip into the world of shiesty individuals 
 A troubled man stalked by criminals 
 Creeping through the city 
 I step on the block to chat with 
 Thugs from all the drugs for fatcat 
 Stepping off the set now hand on my tool 
 Thinking how bad I want to flip on that fool 
 Times are wasting 
 Chasing these punks for petty loot 
 When there is a real mission to execute 
 I put the plan in effect 
 Forget what you heard 
 When you get the word from 1st and 3rd 
 For real I got the fam and all my soldiers to feed 
 With the gunslingers on the block puffin' weed 
 Envision the prison that I walk through 
 Leaving any witness 
 When I'm about to handle my business 
 No escape from the duct tape and artillery 
 Now tell me big man 
 Where's the money ain't a damn thing funny 
 Cops play for medals 
 Killers play for corners 
 In the middle are your sons and are 
 Your daughters 
 Who gives the orders 
 To chaos and mayhem 
 Who has the proper guidance and mind to save them 
 From this cold world of heartless ghetto dwellers 
 Pimps, prostitutes, and dope sellers 
 Strive to be the lead and not follow 
 Ladies 
 You can be the queens of tomorrow 
 Dig it, I want all that and more 
 For my peeps in the stuggle 
 Food, clothing, and shelter 
 Is essential 
 To maintain the hardcore from the soft 
 That pushed me to the edge but I can't fall off 
 My battlegrounds keep the sound of babies crying 
 Gunshots, and cursing 
 Can you feel my reel 
 Here's the deal 
 By any means necessary 
 Go all out 
 And keep this alive 
 'Cause only the strong survive
