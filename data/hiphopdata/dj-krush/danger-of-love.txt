(Feat. Zap Mama) 
 If love is a danger, should we avoid it? 
 If love is a danger, should we avoid it? 
 It was a rainy day today 
 Sky stayed grey 
 A lonely day, lonely day 
 It will be a lovely night 
 Sunshine in my heart 
 Even when we are apart 
 (The danger of love) Drive me crazy 
 (The danger of love) Drives me easy 
 (The danger of love) Makes the power of your day 
 (The danger of love) Makes the power of your way 
 The danger of love... 
 Your love bring the sun in me 
 I could smell your essence 
 With or without your presence 
 It was a lovely day 
 A lovely day 
 A lovely day 
 A lovely day eh 
 (The danger of love) 
 Drive crazy (the danger of love) 
 Drive me insane (the danger of love) 
 Makes the power (the danger of love) 
 Power of our day (the danger of love) 
 Makes the power (the danger of love) 
 Power of your way (the danger of love) 
 (The danger of love) 
 (The danger of love) 
 Lovely day 
 Lovely day 
 It was a rainy day 
 Sky stayed grey 
 They don't know nothing about love 
 Sunshine in me to stay 
 Good night!, sleep tight! (the danger of love) 
 See you in my dream tonight (the danger of love) 
 Good night!, sleep tight! (the danger of love) 
 See you in my dreeeeeeeam (the danger of love) 
 The danger of love 
 The danger of love 
 The danger of love 
 The danger of love 
 The danger of love 
 The danger of love 
 The danger of love 
 The danger of love 
 Good night!, sleep tight! (the danger of love) 
 See you in my dream tonight (the danger of love) 
 Good night!, sleep tight! (the danger of love) 
 See you in my dream tonight (the danger of love) 
 See you in my dream tonight (the danger of love) 
 Good night!, sleep tight! (the danger of love) 
 See you in my dream tonight (the danger of love) 
 See you in my dream tonight (the danger of love) 
 See you in my dream tonight (the danger of love) 
 Tonight 
 Tonight see you in my dream 
 See you in my dream
