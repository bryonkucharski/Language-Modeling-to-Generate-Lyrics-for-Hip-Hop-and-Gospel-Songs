I traveled far to find you 
 Who knew you'd be so far away 
 I will stay now 
 Love 
 This weary heart 
 The only gift I bring you 
 This love I give to you 
 It won't stray 
 I could give you 
 The most delicious kisses on your face 
 You see I need you to be addicted to me 
 I am calm now in the corners of his mouth 
 I am still now, I will not live without 
 I am pure now, safe inside my final home 
 I could give you 
 The most delicious kisses on your face 
 You see I need you to be addicted to me 
 I am calm now in the corners of his mouth 
 I am still now, I will not live without 
 I am pure now, safe inside my final home 
 My home... my home... 
 My home inside you 
 Safe inside my final home 
 My home inside you
