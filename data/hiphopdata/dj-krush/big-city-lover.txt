Cruisin' up and down this avenue 
 Baby, don't you know my eye's on you 
 Hiding in your shadow, gaze is kinda hollow 
 I just like your smile and your hair, it's really wild 
 Big city lover, I'll take a chance on you 
 Big city lover, but I think I like your groove 
 Big city lover, just keep that attitude 
 Didn't take too long to get you home 
 Just to find your heart was made of stone 
 Drowning in my sorrow, love don't like to furrow 
 Never thought you'd leave my feelings on the floor 
 Big city lover, I don't want to hear your lies 
 Big city lover, don't think I sympathize 
 Big city lover, you know I don't like to cry 
 Big city lover, you know I changed my mind 
 Big city lover, I thought that you were kind 
 Big city lover, now I just ain't got the time 
 Big city lover, I don't want to hear your lies 
 Big city lover, don't think I sympathize, no no no 
 Cruisin' up and down this avenue 
 Honey, don't you know my eye's on you 
 Big city lover, hell just might take a chance on you 
 Big city lover, I think I kinda like your groove 
 Big city lover, just lose that attitude
