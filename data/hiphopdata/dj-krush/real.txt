Niggaz don't you know? Never promised tomorrow man 
 Check it, check it the next life 
 Life life (yeah) right now for what it is before you lose that shit 
 For real man, shit can happen 
 In the blink of a fuckin' eye you can lose your life man 
 Recognize that for real 
 You're never promise tomorrow, you know 
 Any nigga that you know, knahmsayin? 
 You never know about these things, word up 
 His body was cold yet his face remained calmly 
 He spoke differently, as if he was Godly 
 Layin on the ground the gat still in his clutches 
 Shoulda saw it comin' but he smoked too many Dutches 
 Situation, made me sober as fuck 
 As he coughed up blood, tellin' me he's stuck 
 Gunmen, drove off in a Yukon truck 
 Said a prayer for him, hopin that his soul was blessed 
 Cause my hands couldn't cover all the holes in his chest 
 His eyes told the story that his heart was diminished 
 The ambulence took about a hour, ten minutes 
 They didn't have to tell me that my Son life was finished 
 I guess his heart never knew the love that was in it 
 Yeah, word up, goin' back 
 If your heart stop beating I'll go back in time 
 Make your heart beat again, real niggaz to the end 
 It's all about cash, and the diamond rings 
 Dedicated, cause real niggaz do real things 
 If your heart stop beating I'll go back in time 
 Make your heart beat again, real niggaz to the end 
 It's all about cash, and the diamond rings 
 Dedicated, cause real niggaz do real things 
 Word up, real things, real niggaz do real things 
 Yo, movin on 
 Through his eyes I seen the next life flash in front of his 
 Cocked back the gat wonderin who the gunner is 
 The blood drenched in his Armani linen 
 I guess that's the karma of a thug when he sinnin 
 From the beginnin, I reminisce the younger years 
 When we were younger peers on the block pourin out beers 
 And now the tears, I can't stop from comin' 
 I wanna bring it to this nigga blaze him while he runnin' 
 It seemed stunnin, the way we started in the game 
 I never wanted, my Son dyin' in this pain 
 Now the nigga that shot him I wanna find him and kill him 
 Heard he's a Willie and keep a bunch of killers with him 
 The Jake snatched him up so I just had to forget him 
 But on the low, if I ever see him, I'ma hit him 
 Yo when he bust a slug in the heart of a true thug 
 It's real love, this is what a real nigga does 
 If your heart stop beating I'll go back in time 
 Make your heart beat again, real niggaz to the end 
 It's all about cash, and the diamond rings 
 Dedicated, cause real niggaz do real things 
 If your heart stop beating I'll go back in time

 What yo, real niggaz do real things 
 Word up, real niggaz do... real niggaz, yeah 
 Yo, 41st side, Queensbridge yo, yo 
 The words cut like a knife, ma your son was shot 
 Her mouth, wide open, seemed like her heart dropped 
 She fell to the floor with her eyes in shock 
 I was standin there stuck off the words I said 
 Worst thing to tell a mother that her son was dead 
 Shoulda knew what love is, 'fore he learned what a thug is 
 Now he left his kids to be raised by they mothers 
 From the cradle to the grave we was like brothers 
 Went to same schools and fucked the same bitches 
 Pumped on the same block with the same snitches 
 Burnin lye on the roof, talkin' bout riches 
 And I remember, when we was both five percenters 
 Goin' hand to hand, gettin' bent, crashin renters 
 And now the end is, justifyin all the means 
 That's just the story when you're dyin' out in Queens 
 And it's real, word up, yo, yo, yo, yeah, yo 
 If your heart stop beating I'll go back in time 
 Make your heart beat again, real niggaz to the end 
 It's all about cash, and the diamond rings 
 Dedicated, cause real niggaz do real things 
 If your heart stop beating I'll go back in time 
 Make your heart beat again, real niggaz to the end 
 It's all about cash, and the diamond rings 
 Dedicated, cause real niggaz do real things 
 Yeah, Capone-N-Noreaga still my niggaz 
 Even if you don't get no bigger 
 Finsta, Crash, presidential 
 Confidential, fuck it, yo, yo, what? 
 Japan rules, foreign exchange, how we do, yo 
 Begins, world currency 
 The way the dollar bends, and it haunts me 
 It wants me it traps me, in the hole 
 Reachin' for my soul, fuck it, yo 
 If your heart stop beating I'll go back in time 
 Make your heart beat again, real niggaz to the end 
 It's all about cash, and the diamond rings 
 Dedicated, cause real niggaz do real things
