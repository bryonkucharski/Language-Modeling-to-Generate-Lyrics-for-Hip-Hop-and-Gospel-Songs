(Feat. Deborah Anderson) 
 The sun moves high above 
 Watching below all that moves so fast 
 Plus taking on a different game 
 A future that was built to last 
 I see your face light up my screen 
 You say hello but I can't 
 Hold you 
 Does this all feel somewhat for real with what no limits to us 
 We can do 
 We're making such big steps 
 It's got me in a spin 
 Are we aiming too high 
 Of wanting to feel your skin against my skin, my skin, my skin 
 Neon lights are everywhere 
 Lighting up the crowded streets 
 It brightens up my floating bed 
 Where I lay myself to sleep 
 Did you receive the kiss I sent today 
 Up on the box in Time Square? 
 How I love the once and yesterday before it vanished into thin air 
 We're making such big steps 
 It's got me in a spin 
 Are we aiming too high 
 Of wanting to feel your skin against my skin, my skin, my skin 
 You're never really here 
 This is all a big mistake 
 My heart is feeling cold 
 I don't want to bake it
