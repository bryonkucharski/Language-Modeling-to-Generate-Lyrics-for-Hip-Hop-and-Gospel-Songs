I heard that you feelin' Teyana 
 You said she a fly lil mama 
 I heard that you feelin' Teyana 
 You swear she a fly lil mama 
 Dreams of sleeping with a R&B chick, B chick 
 I heard your little bars about my cleavage, dream shit 
 Don't waste my time, if you comin' nigga come right 
 Got a couple niggas on my line 
 Nigga all I'm tryna say 
 You know that I hear you boy 
 Niggas talk that shit all day 
 Tell me you something different boy 
 Ooh boy I want different 
 Boy I want something different 
 So you better come with it 
 Boy you better come with it 
 'Cause whoever get in it 
 Is automatically winnin' 
 Dreams of sleeping with a R&B bitch 
 This pedestal so high niggas can't reach it 
 And yet I hear you runnin' game 
 You're not the first to sing my name 
 Everyone wanted Teyana 
 A singer, a dancer, designer 
 I heard you in love with a Harlem 
 Ass doesn't shake when she walkin' 
 No need to send me no bottle 
 Nigga I pay for my order 
 Should be accustom to customs 
 Had that ass crossin' the border 
 Had yo ass crossin' the border 
 Dreams of sleepin' with an R&B... 
 And I know you got them dreams of fuckin' me 
 So stop wastin' time 
 If you comin' nigga come right 
 Got a couple niggas on my line 
 But 
 Boy you know that I'm taken 
 Boy you know that I'm taken 
 I don't really wanna play again 
 And I'm gone and I'm taken 
 'Cause you know that I'm taken 
 I apologize, apologize 
 That I got ya hype but blow my mind now 
 I apologize but I'm taken 
 Apologize but I'm taken
