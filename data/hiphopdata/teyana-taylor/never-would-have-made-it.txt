Never would have made it 
 Never would have made it without you 
 You're the highlight of my life 
 You're the sunshine in my night 
 Oh how, oh how, oh, do I 
 Ever repay you 
 Finally, I know what I want 
 I learned from my mistakes and my heartbreaks 
 The road to hell was paved with good intentions 
 No matter which one you, no matter which one you take 
 Never truly follow my heart 
 Made a lot of decisions based on everyone but me 
 But now, I'm strong enough to let it go 
 I'm wise enough to take control 
 My mama told me everything I know 
 You're the highlight of my life 
 You're the sunshine in my night 
 Oh how, oh how, oh, how do I 
 Ever repay you 
 Stand up, press forward, move on 
 Don't cry, we'll make it through the night 
 For sure 
 You're the highlight of my life 
 You're the sunshine in my night 
 Oh how, Oh how, oh, do I 
 Ever repay you 
 Never would have made it 
 Never would have made it without you
