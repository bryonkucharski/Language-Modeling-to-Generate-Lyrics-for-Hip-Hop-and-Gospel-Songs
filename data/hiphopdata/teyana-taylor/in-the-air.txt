Here we are, going back at it again 
 Are you serious? 
 I guess you are, you are, you are 
 You got me sitting home while you on some other shit 
 I guess that you must have forgot who you dealing with 
 Well so long 
 I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone 
 Right before I leave I put one in the air for love, love, love 
 Right before I leave I put one in the air for love, love, love 
 So long, so long, I'm gone 
 I don't wanna talk 
 So I'm blocking your calls, pretty sure I heard it all before 
 Do I need to say more? 
 While I was home alone you were away with other chicks 
 I guess that you must have forgot who you're fuckin' with 
 Well so long 
 I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone 
 So right before I leave I put one in the air for love, love, love 
 Right before I leave I put one in the air for love, love, love 
 So long, so long, I'm gone 
 So right before I leave I put one in the air for love, love, love 
 Right before I leave I put one in the air for love, love, love 
 I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
