If I tell you you belong to me 
 Would you be mine in reality? 
 And not just in my mind 
 I'm so tired of being invisible to you 
 I'm so tired 
 How could a boy like you ever want a girl like me 
 You're way outta my league, way outta my league 
 'Cause boys like you won't ever want a girl like me 
 You're way outta my, outta my, outta my league
