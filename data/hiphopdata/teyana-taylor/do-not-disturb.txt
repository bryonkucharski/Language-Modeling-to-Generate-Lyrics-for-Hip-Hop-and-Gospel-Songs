 So I got this feeling 
 You and I need a moment 
 I want you to love me, babe 
 Make me know it

 Come and show it 
 Let me satisfy you tonight 
 Come inside, sit on my couch, oh

 Let me ride, hear it all out, uh

 Not another minute later, so come on 
 Put your money where your mouth is 
 Give you what you paid for, come on

 And I want to spend some time 
 No enter sign on the door 
 Oh, no, please don't disturb 
 Please, no, don't disturb, no
