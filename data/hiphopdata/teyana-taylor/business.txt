Ever since the first time I laid eyes on you 
 I saw the truth 
 No questions, just proof 
 And they talk, but I ain't hear a thing they said about you 
 Ever since the first time we laid up 
 Everybody want details, but don't say nothin' 
 I won't say nothin' 
 If you don't say nothin' 
 'Cause this is between us 
 Yeah, we gon' fight 
 But I'mma love you till it's alright 
 Ain't gon' find these answers outside 
 Boy, we don't need nobody's advice 
 Give me your shoulder to cry on 
 And I'll be alright 
 I'll be the one you rely on 
 This love 
 Ain't none of your friends business 
 Ain't none of my friends business 
 It's ours, all ours, nobody elses 
 None of your friends business 
 Ain't none of my friends business 
 Ain't none of your friends business 
 Ain't none of my friends business 
 Boy, it's ours, baby, it's ours 
 Don't ask me "How was the sex?" 
 That's between me, my man and our bed 
 Plus I know how you hoes get 
 I ain't tryna lose a friend telling you how my man do it the best 
 And the same goes for you, baby, I know how niggas do 
 Your friends be talking crazy, acting like bitches, too 
 You know they do 
 None of your friends business 
 Ain't none of my friends business 
 Ain't none of your friends business 
 Ain't none of my friends business 
 Boy, it's ours, baby, it's ours 
 So we don't need nobody else 
 All we need is us 
 Opinions get involved babe 
 Fucks up all the trust 
 The bond, the love 
 You're scared, me too 
 He hurt me, she hurt you 
 You're taking a risk. Well, me, too
