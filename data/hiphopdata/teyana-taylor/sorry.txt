He tells me I'm beautiful everyday 
 The better part of him, hear him say 
 Now as you're watching far away 
 All I can say, "I'm so sorry" 
 You had your cake and a gift that day 
 Something that I love didn't create 
 Now as you watch from far away 
 All I can say is, "I'm so sorry" 
 Never again 'cause now I know 
 Just what it means to love and be loved 
 Now as you watch from far away 
 All I can say is, "I'm sorry" 
 I'm sorry you didn't know how to love me 
 I'm sorry I wasn't beautiful to you 
 I'm sorry, you just didn't understand how to be my man 
 I'm sorry you couldn't make me happy 
 And I'm so sorry you never learned how 
 I'm so sorry it had to be this way 
 But my heart is so good now 
 Now as you watch from far away 
 I said baby, oh, baby 
 All I can say, "I'm sorry" 
 I'm sorry you lost me 
 He tells me I'm beautiful everyday 
 The better part of him hear him say 
 Now as you watch, baby 
 I'm sorry
