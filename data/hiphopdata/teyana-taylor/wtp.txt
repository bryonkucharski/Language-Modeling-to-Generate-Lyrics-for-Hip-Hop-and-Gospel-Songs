Work this pussy, work this pussy, work this pussy 
 Work this pussy, work this pussy, work this pussy 
 Work this pussy, work this pussy, work this pussy 
 (She's a motherfucking international sensation) 
 Work this pussy, work this pussy, work this pussy 
 (She's not your average showgirl) 
 I'm still, I'm still right here tonight 
 So I will, make you cum through the night 
 Will you touch me, will you go deep in me 
 I will in the sheets 
 I will, I will, I-I-I will 
 She's a motherfuckin' international sensation 
 She's not your average show girl 
 Allow Miss Taylor to sing the blues 
 I'm still, I'm still right here tonight 
 So I will, make you cum through the night 
 Will you touch me, will you go deep in me 
 I will in the sheets 
 I will, I will, I-I-I will 
 She's a motherfuckin' international sensation 
 She's not your average show girl 
 Allow Miss Taylor to sing the blues 
 I'm still, I'm still right here tonight 
 So I will, make you cum through the night 
 Will you touch me, will you go deep in me 
 I will in the sheets 
 I will, I will, I-I-I will 
 Save your tears honey, you're a motherfucking diva 
 These fancy cunts can't take you, Miss Taylor 
 I believe that there's a big future out there with a lot of beautiful things 
 I want so much more I want my name to be a household product in the high fashion world
