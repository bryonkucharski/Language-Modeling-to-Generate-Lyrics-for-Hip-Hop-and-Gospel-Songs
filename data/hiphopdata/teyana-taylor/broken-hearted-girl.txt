Boy I see you looking at me, looking at you 
 I already know what you want, 'cause I want that shit too 
 It don't matter if you're single, single 
 Either way I just wanna take you home, take you home 
 And it don't matter if you got a past, got a past 
 'Cause I ain't got nothing to do with that, do with that, do with that So 
 I wanna touch you 
 Right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now 
 I wanna touch you 
 Right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now 
 We ain't gotta waste time going out on dates 
 We ain't gotta count down till you come to my place 
 We ain't gotta, (you ain't gotta), we ain't gotta, (you ain't gotta) 
 We ain't gotta, (you ain't gotta) we ain't gotta, (you ain't gotta) 
 You ain't gotta waste time sending me roses 
 They gon' die anyway, man them shits boring 
 You ain't gotta, (you ain't gotta), you ain't gotta, (you ain't gotta) 
 You ain't gotta, (you ain't gotta) You ain't gotta, (you ain't gotta) 
 'Cause I want you right now 
 Look you need to stop playing with yourself (what?) 
 Like I ain't who you playing when you playing with yourself 
 You playing the shy role, I was playing it myself 
 But it's no good for you, now you playing with your health like 
 I ain't who you thinking 'bout 
 When you layin' by yourself 
 Know you heard it was a movie 
 Better stop role playing with yourself like 
 Like, like, stop frontin' 
 Know they coming at your neck like a top button 
 You need to go ahead and drop it for a nigga 
 So I can come behind and like 'Miss you dropped something' 
 And fuck is these roses for, what all these clothes is for 
 I wanna close the door, fuck till we dozin' off 
 Wake up and go again, what's the mimosas for 
 You got the juicy things, champagne toast to yours 
 Cheers shawty, yeah shawty 
 Time to face your fears shawty 
 Climb up on it and hit them gears shawty 
 #BikeLife #MightWife 
 Got my heart like likes, looked at her like psyche 
 Looked at her like psyche 
 You ain't gotta 
 Hey T stop playin' with me 
 The last nigga broke my heart 
 You probably break it too, no baby 
 I'd rather just play my part than to play a fool, no 
 It don't matter if you're single, single 
 Either way I just wanna take you home, take you home 
 And it don't matter if you got a past, got a past 
 'Cause I ain't got nothing to do with that, do with that, do with that So 
 I wanna touch you 
 Right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now 
 I wanna touch you 
 Right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now 
 We ain't gotta waste time going out on dates 
 We ain't gotta count down till you come to my place 
 We ain't gotta, (you ain't gotta), we ain't gotta, (you ain't gotta) 
 We ain't gotta, (you ain't gotta) we ain't gotta, (you ain't gotta) 
 You ain't gotta waste time sending me roses 
 They gon' die anyway, man them shits boring 
 You ain't gotta, (you ain't gotta), you ain't gotta, (you ain't gotta) 
 You ain't gotta, (you ain't gotta) You ain't gotta, (you ain't gotta) 
 'Cause I want you right now
