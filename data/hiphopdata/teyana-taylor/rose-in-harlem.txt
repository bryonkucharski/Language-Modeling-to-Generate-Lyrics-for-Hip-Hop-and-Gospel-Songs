A rose in Harlem, a rose in Harlem 
 A rose in Harlem, a rose in Harlem 
 Been through more than a lil' bit 
 Been through more than a lil' bit 
 But I ain't callin' no names out 
 No, no free promotion 
 Naw, naw I ain't late, I don't do due dates 
 No sneak diss, no sneak shit 
 That's just how I was raised 
 Had to get it out the soil 
 I been down, I been loyal 
 When you really hold it down 
 Niggas ain't even really down for ya 
 Oh no, what a shame 
 10 years in the game 
 Niggas like 'You ain't hot? You ain't pop yet? 
 What's up wit' you and Ye?' 
 (A rose in Harlem) Girl out the concrete 
 (A rose in Harlem) You know it ain't sweet 
 (A rose in Harlem) Can't tell me any- any- any- anything 
 It be the ones who say they ride for you 
 It be the ones, the ones you love, them too 
 It be the ones who swear they real, not true 
 It be them ones, It be them ones 
 Don't get caught up 
 It be the ones, the ones you closest too 
 It be the ones, the ones you trust - them too 
 It be the ones, the ones you look up to 
 It be the ones 
 Don't get caught up, young girl 
 (A rose in Harlem) Girl out the concrete 
 (A rose in Harlem) You know it ain't sweet 
 (A rose in Harlem) Can't tell me any- any- any- anything 
 Been through more than a lil' bit 
 Been through more than a lil' bit 
 But I ain't callin' no names out 
 No, no free promotions 
 If it ain't 'bout blessings 
 I can't even address it 
 I just bought my third house 
 No album out and I got 'em asking 
 'What do she do?' I do everything 
 I move everything 
 Put that on my wedding ring 
 Put that on my baby name 
 All these fake smiles 
 These chicks must just came from a dentist 
 I can tell it ain't genuine 
 I get so offended 
 (A rose in Harlem) Girl out the concrete 
 (A rose in Harlem) You know it ain't sweet 
 (A rose in Harlem) Can't tell me any- any- any- anything 
 It be the ones who say they ride for you 
 It be the ones, the ones you love, them too 
 It be the ones who swear they real, not true 
 It be them ones, It be them ones 
 Don't get caught up 
 It be the ones, the ones you closest too 
 It be the ones, the ones you trust - them too 
 It be the ones, the ones you look up to 
 It be the ones 
 Don't get caught up, young girl 
 It be the ones who say they ride for you 
 It be the ones, the ones you love, them too 
 It be the ones who swear they real, not true 
 It be them ones, It be them ones 
 Don't get caught up 
 It be the ones, the ones you closest too 
 It be the ones, the ones you trust - them too 
 It be the ones, the ones you look up to 
 It be the ones 
 Don't get caught up, young girl 
 A rose in Harlem, a rose in Harlem 
 A rose in Harlem, a rose in Harlem 
 Don't get caught up, young girl
