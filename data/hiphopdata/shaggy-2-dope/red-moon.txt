The wind chill is wicked now, 
 Tomb stones are crooked now. 
 Well I'm walking home I just left this bitch house 
 3 am when I looked in the clouds 
 Like an eyeball watching you 
 Who are the werewolves talking to 
 The moon is red and its big as hell 
 So the streets are alive and I'm by myself 
 This is Delray where the crackheads creep 
 Red moon hanging high mean the dead don't sleep 
 Street lights go out the city black I'm blind 
 All I see is the red moon above me flying 
 My eyes are just to the bloody red glow 
 Aluminating a block and telling me what I know 
 That tonight many more will join the dead 
 Its just me and the moon baby painting the town red 
 The moon is red (watch out watch out watch out) 
 I go blind (watch out watch out... because its killing time) 
 The moon is red (watch out watch out watch out) 
 I lose my mind (watch out watchout... because its killing time) 
 There's people like me everywhere 
 I don't see none but I know they there 
 I walk underneath the red moons powers 
 It's so surprisingly hypnotizing me 
 Hear a scream or two distant cries 
 Listen as the angry dead rise 
 The red moon reminds us all of the forgotten 
 And it gots every murderer on the move plottin 
 The moon above with it I'm in love 
 Shining all over me the color of blood 
 I'm in the house only this ain't my house 
 I got a axe buried into some old ladies mouth 
 I'm outside again runnin' jumpin' in the moon beams 
 Bloody red moon I know what it means 
 I'm haunted walking with the possessd 
 And it ain't gonna stop until I'm under arrest 
 The moon is red (watch out watch out watch out) 
 I go blind (watch out watch out... because its killing time) 
 The moon is red (watch out watch out watch out) 
 I lose my mind (watch out watchout... because its killing time) 
 There ain't that many red moons in Delray 
 Only when its time for these fools to pay 
 Justified anger turns into revenge 
 With red moon above people ain't your friend 
 I stuck a guarding claw into the face of a hooker 
 Crackhead climb out a sewer and took her 
 Body down its feeding time no misleading 
 Red moon high bring the slaughtering season 
 The trees catch shadows that stretch for blocks 
 Found a dead gangbanger took his shoes and socks 
 The red moon light painted all out the streets 
 Coming from the sky I'm hearing voodoo drum beats 
 Its total madness until the new day dawns 
 I'm bloody butt naked sitting on my front lawn 
 The red moon passes with the new day sun 
 And I'm left with the agony of what I've done 
 The moon is red (watch out watch out watch out) 
 I go blind (watch out watch out... because its killing time) 
 The moon is red (watch out watch out watch out) 
 I lose my mind (watch out watchout... because its killing time)
