 And shunned by the church, 
 From the womb to the hearse.

 Here's about time I sent your punk ass to meet your maker. 
 Flatlines ain't new to me, neither is pulled plugs, 
 Black out for weeks at a time due to prescription drugs. 
 But don't worry, you'll be straight Jesus saves, 
 It's about time I get to digging these shallow graves.
