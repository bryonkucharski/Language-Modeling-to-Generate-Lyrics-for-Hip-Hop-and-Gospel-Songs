I had my face paint on when it all went down 
 82 Chevrolet crawlin' round 
 Made a left turn swerve to the right 
 Lookin' in the mirror blue lights 
 Stop my car what the fuck I do? 
 I finished my brew and said fuck you 
 He got all upset and pulled his gun out 
 I hate cops wouldn't mind takin' one out 
 He's pattin' me down, I put him in a headlock. 
 DDT'ed him on the sidewalk. 
 Threw his dead body in the trunk. 
 Went to the party and got crunk. 
 Let the bumps bump. I met a fat chick. 
 We pullin' out, she about to snack on dick. 
 When, again, I'm pulled over. 
 Undercover pig in a dark green Nova. 
 (Violent J) Over. Pull me over. (Shaggy) I'm the one. 
 (Violent J) Over. Pull me over. (Shaggy) I'm the one. 
 Woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop. 
 (Violent J) Over. Pull me over. (Shaggy) I'm the one. 
 I'm tryin' to walk a straight line. 
 But I'm blew back. 
 An this bitch cop been knew that. 
 He said he taking me in, I said fuck that. 
 You see dis dick in my hands, she Finn to suck that. 
 And you fuck everything up. 
 With all this bullshit talkin' bout hand cuffs. 
 What the fuck? I kicked him in the nuts. 
 Grabbed his own pistol and blew out his guts. 
 Jumped back in the Chevy and mashed it down. 
 A terrified fat bitch and a wicked clown. 
 We went across town to get a pizza. 
 The whole time duckin' la policía. 
 It's a beautiful night I must say. 
 This bitch only stay two blocks away. 
 I made a left hand turn from the right lane. 
 And the same shit happened again. 
 (Violent J) Over. Pull me over. (Shaggy) I'm the one. 
 (Violent J) Over. Pull me over. (Shaggy) I'm the one. 
 Woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop. 
 (Violent J) Over. Pull me over. (Shaggy) I'm the one. 
 License and registration? Please. 
 I stole dis bitch, I ain't even got keys. 
 I got a fuckin' screwdriver in the dash. 
 I pulled it out showed him and stabbed his ass. 
 I peeled off fast as hell. Past two more cop cars. 
 Fuck Jail. We shootin' it out. 
 I thought they told ya. 
 I say fuck you and I ain't pullin' over. 
 Fat chick screamin', I'm all through the trees. 
 Pushin' 85 at least. 
 I lost them both but ran into a road block. 
 And this bitch won't reload the glock. 
 Pulled a U turn and whipped down a side street. 
 Don't matter; they got me on the high beams. 
 I jumped out of the car while it was rollin'. 
 Ran into the darkness and heard it explodin'. 
 (Violent J) Over. Pull me over. (Shaggy) I'm the one. 
 (Violent J) Over. Pull me over. (Shaggy) I'm the one. 
 Woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop. 
 (Violent J) Over. Pull me over. (Shaggy) I'm the one. 
 (Cop) Wanna tell us what's goin' on here? 
 Woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop. 
 (Cop) What do you mean you're just driven' home? You wanna tell us what that smell is? What do I smell there?
