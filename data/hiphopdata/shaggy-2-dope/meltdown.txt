Industrial wasted the whole hood is 
 Toxic smoke for all ya little kids 
 Bring the family, come down to delray 
 Where the nuclear air will microwave your brain 
 Straight dogs get fat like wild boars 
 Attackin in packs and bringing down the doors 
 Giant rats, big as five feet long 
 Some even got wings, attack you airborne 
 We go fine ho's, hot as can be, 
 But she might have a hand growing outta her knee 
 Don't bother me my little homie gots a duck head 
 I tell him "quack" like it was nothing said 
 Bitches round her are radio active 
 Burn right through any provocative 
 Right here is where ya wanna vacation 
 'Less you scared of a little radiation 
 (Every body dies) Everybody dies anyway so why not 
 (Every body dies) Everybody dies anyway bo-oring 
 (Every body dies) Everybody dies anyway so why not 
 It's a wonder place to stay! 
 Do it in Delray! 
 (Every body dies) Everybody dies anyway so why not 
 (Every body dies) Everybody dies anyway bo-oring 
 (Every body dies) Everybody dies anyway so why not 
 It's a wonder place to stay! 
 Do it in Delray! 
 A truck spilled plutonium all over the streets 
 Mutating everybody into freaks 
 I gotta nose growin' outta my forehead 
 I'm living in an old nuclear warhead 
 Siamese twins are born in 5 packs 
 Ninjas with legs growin' outta their backs, kickin' it 
 Let it rain, let it drip hot acid 
 Do it in delray! It's fantastic! 
 Come visit, ain' nothing exquisite 
 Something run about you have you screaming "what the fuck is it?" 
 Air's fucked up, so you lucked up 
 Grow a mouth under your ear that never shuts up 
 No hotels, just crash in the trash 
 Oh that smell is just atomic gas 
 This is the place for you and your loved ones 
 Poisonous, deadly, sickly and Fun! 
 (Every body dies) Everybody dies anyway so why not 
 (Every body dies) Everybody dies anyway bo-oring

 I was attacked by somethin' 
 Half man, half opossum 
 Any fucking who that shot him 
 But it wouldn't die 
 I shot it some mo' 
 It just kept going 
 The dope man's got a fish head 
 With a hook in his lip 
 He don't care if you look 
 But don't trip 
 A chemically molded, beautiful place 
 (Ew that bitch got a dick growing outta her face) 
 Come and climb a smoke stack and take a hit 
 Take a look into the black smoke bottomless pit 
 My face feels hot, I feel it meltin' 
 Seconds later that man was a skeleton 
 No food, no shopping plaza malls 
 Just a seven legged man that crawls 
 An he'd sparen' you a dime or two 
 Bring the family through 
 This is the place to do! 
 (Every body dies) Everybody dies anyway so why not 
 (Every body dies) Everybody dies anyway bo-oring 
 (Every body dies) Everybody dies anyway so why not 
 It's a wonder place to stay! 
 Do it in Delray 
 (Every body dies) Everybody dies anyway so why not 
 (Every body dies) Everybody dies anyway bo-oring 
 (Every body dies) Everybody dies anyway so why not 
 It's a wonder place to stay! 
 Do it in Delray 
 (Every body dies) Everybody dies anyway so why not 
 (Every body dies) Everybody dies anyway bo-oring 
 (Every body dies) Everybody dies anyway so why not 
 It's a wonder place to stay!
