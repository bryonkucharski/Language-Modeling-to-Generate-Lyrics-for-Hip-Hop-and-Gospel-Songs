Maggots can't fuck with the Shaggy 'cause I got a crew 
 Bitch, a crew like you ain't never even known 
 Carnival freaks from the ghetto zone 
 All waitin' for the day to put you in your place 
 I'll have the fat bearded lady sittin' on your face 
 Bitch boy, bitchy, you might get hurt 
 Dead Carnival clowns puttin' in w-w-w-work 
 You think you're the shit 'cause you think you got the 
 Upper hand 
 But won't you come and meet my boy, The Strong Man 
 And he'll grab you by the head and squeeze it till it 
 Pops 
 And shake your muthafuckin' neck until your head flops 
 'Cause I'm runnin' with the bee-yacht, ya muthafucks 
 I'll make a voodoo doll of ya and flick your nuts 
 See I was born to cause a killa carny ruckus 
 I came out the neden, started to chokin' muthafuckas 
 I leave the screwdriver stickin' halfway out your dome 
 The worst part part about it is, I'm not alone 
 Jokers and freaks deep in the night 
 Thought I was a nerd but ya picked the wrong fight 
 Ya think you're Jimmy Crackcorn, but they don't care 
 They bust you in your muthafuckin' head with a chair 
 Jokers and freaks deep in the night 
 Thought I was a nerd but ya picked the wrong fight 
 Ya think you're Jimmy Crackcorn, but they don't care 
 They bust you in your muthafuckin' head with a chair 
 I'm a nerd, and all the bitches call me a nerdy geek 
 And they would love to stick they thumbtacks on my 
 Seat 
 And they would throw they spitballs at the class freak 
 And everyone of them bitches died in they sleep 
 'Cause I fuck around with books at the circus barn 
 Crystal balls, black magic and jokers cards 
 And at night, just when I'm feelin' lonely 
 The clowns come to my bed and juggle for me 
 So don't fuck with the Shaggs 'cause I cast spells 
 And don't come cryin' to me when your tongue swells 
 I'm hangin' with freakshows, like Crab Boy 
 Snake Boy 
 Flipper and Scab Boy 
 And a man who can eat his own fuckin' face 
 And then shit it out and screw it back into place 
 If ya don't think so, you can suck my bone 
 'Cause I tried tellin' ya man, I'm not alone 
 Jokers and freaks deep in the night 
 Thought I was a nerd but ya picked the wrong fight 
 Ya think you're Jimmy Crackcorn, but they don't care 
 They bust you in your muthafuckin' head with a chair 
 Jokers and freaks deep in the night 
 Thought I was a nerd but ya picked the wrong fight 
 Ya think you're Jimmy Crackcorn, but they don't care 
 They bust you in your muthafuckin' head with a chair 
 Jokers and freaks... jokers and freaks... 
 Well, I like to hang with Tall Jess and Jumpsteady 
 Nate The Mack and Violent J and Uncle Freddy 
 Chunky Mutha Fucky and Stefan got my respect 
 But I really like to hang with old Rubberneck 
 A freakshow 
 And I fuck the Lion Lady in the neden hole 
 And sometimes she do an acrobatic flip on my nuts 
 And it feels so goooooooood! 
 So tell your boys that they all a bunch of trump 
 Suckas 
 I walk around your neighborhood chokin' muthafuckas 
 I used to be a fool but now the jokers got juice 
 Shit changed when I started hangin' out with Zeus 
 And if you take me out, you know I'm comin' back again 
 With my homeboys Jack and the Cannon Man 
 He come flyin' out the barrel doin' Mach 9 
 With his fist comin' straight for your spine 
 Never fuck with the Shaggs 'cause it's always tickin' 
 I throw a curse and turn your ass into a chicken 
 So when you see me by my lonely in the ghetto zone 
 Muthafuck, ya better realize, I'm not alone 
 Jokers and freaks deep in the night 
 Thought I was a nerd but ya picked the wrong fight 
 Ya think you're Jimmy Crackcorn, but they don't care 
 They bust you in your muthafuckin' head with a chair 
 Jokers and freaks deep in the night 
 Thought I was a nerd but ya picked the wrong fight 
 Ya think you're Jimmy Crackcorn, but they don't care 
 They bust you in your muthafuckin' head with a chair 
 Who's that? Who's there? No! Stop it! Ah! 
 Ah, I can't stand it! Ah! Go away! Leave me 
 Alone! No! No! Ah! 
 Jokers and freaks deep in the night
