Got the hurt 
 What the hurt 
 Got the juice 
 Let's see you do it 
 Come on just do it 
 Come on just do it 
 Could you, would you 
 Walk to the tracks 
 With the thought you won't be back 
 You left your note don't contemplate 
 And stop the train with your face 
 Could you, would you 
 Steal a ride 
 Collect your homies Southwest side 
 Pull up storefront for a job 
 Your boy got shot, what went wrong? 
 Could you, would you 
 See a bitch 
 And know for a fact you ain't get shit (Trick) 
 Beat that ass I'll say it's Nate 
 Now you a blues, chillin' up state 
 Could you, would you 
 Clutch a knife 
 And randomly take someone's life 
 Grab the neck and cut right through it 
 Come on big man here's your knife 
 Do it! 
 Come on just do it 
 Come on just do it 
 Come on just do it 
 Come on just do it 
 Come on just do it 
 Would you, could you 
 Walk behind 
 Some old lady deaf and blind 
 Push her down and snatch her shit 
 Not even knowing that she raised her grandkids 
 Would you, could you 
 Get some pills 
 Valium, Percocet, Nyquils 
 Take them all when you're alone 
 Knowing damn well someone's coming home 
 Would you, could you 
 Cop a magnum 
 Go to school with one intention 
 Everybody freeze, on your knees, hold it 
 Dumb motherfucker, forgot to load it 
 Would you, could you 
 Get a blade 
 Feel all bad cause you got a little played 
 Got a beef? Man ya blew it 
 Here's your wrist and blade 
 Now do it! 
 Come on just do it 
 Come on just do it 
 Come on just do it 
 Come on just do it 
 Come on just do it 
 Do you have the heart? 
 Do you have the soul? 
 When it boils down to it 
 Are you able to do it? 
 Will you have a conscience? 
 Will you live in fear? 
 When it boils down to it 
 Are you able to do it? 
 Come on just do it 
 Come on just do it 
 Come on just do it 
 Come on just do it 
 Come on just do it 
 Come on just do it 
 Come on just do it 
 Come on just do it 
 Come on just do it 
 Come on just do it
