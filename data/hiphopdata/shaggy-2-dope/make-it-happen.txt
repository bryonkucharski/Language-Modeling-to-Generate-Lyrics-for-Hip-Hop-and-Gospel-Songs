There's no stopping me, though everybody tries 
 It's a one track course, labeled a destiny to shine 
 No motherfucker best get in my path 
 My hands, your neck, bitch, do the math 
 I be stompin, rompin, rumbling through 
 Leavin' piles of bodies behind me like the bird flu 
 Juggalos slappin face off, no question 
 Whippin through these hoes with harmful intentions 
 They call me Sewer Dweller, 'cause I live in the shit 
 Deep in the dirt, and far down beneath it 
 But it's time for us to rise, every full moon's eve 
 And servin' you fools with the Headless Boogie 
 Possessed by the Carnival, speakin' in tongues 
 Usin' human leg bones to beat my voodoo drums 
 And the shit don't stop till the morning sun 
 I make it happen, motherfucker, for Juggalo Love 
 I make it HAPPEN! 
 With no questions asked 
 I make it HAPPEN! 
 Like it's my only task 
 I'm sick of the truth 
 And I'm sick of the lies 
 It's about to happen, NOW 
 Juggalos, all right! 
 I make it HAPPEN! 
 Since the day of my birth 
 I make it HAPPEN! 
 For all it's worth 
 I'm sick of the truth 
 And I'm sick of the lies 
 It's about to happen, NOW 
 Juggalos, all right! 
 It's all bad, no good, comin' out your mouth 
 I'm gonna rip your jaw off and cut your tongue out 
 You's venomous fucker, slitherin' bitch 
 Nuttin you can say, nuttin can stop this death wish 
 Now you runnin' from the script, and beat down with the hatchet 
 Cause you see the majors claimin' and you can't seem to catch it 
 But it's just out your reach, you're never gonna grab it 
 Stupid motherfucker, bitin' is for faggots 
 Your lightbulb popped, and your spotlight broke 
 You got dragged through the mud, now your name is a joke 
 You can kiss my ass, first off this, faggot 
 Don't forget to fuck the fuck off, second 
 Ain't no time machines here, pal, you're fucked 
 Your momma should've taught you how to keep your mouth shut 
 If it wasn't for bad, you'd have no luck 
 I make it happen, motherfucker, get off my nuts 
 I make it HAPPEN! 
 With no questions asked 
 I make it HAPPEN! 
 Like it's my only task 
 I'm sick of the truth 
 And I'm sick of the lies 
 It's about to happen, NOW 
 Juggalos, all right! 
 I make it HAPPEN! 
 Since the day of my birth 
 I make it HAPPEN! 
 For all it's worth 
 I'm sick of the truth 
 And I'm sick of the lies 
 It's about to happen, NOW 
 Juggalos, all right! 
 Where my hatchet-swingers?(HERE!) 
 Where my hatchet-swingers?(HERE!) 
 Where my hatchet-swingers?(HERE!) 
 I can't here you, yo, where my hatchet-swingers?(RIGHT HERE!) 
 Where my hatchet-swingers?(HERE!) 
 Where my hatchet-swingers?(HERE!) 
 Where my hatchet-swingers?(HERE!) 
 I can't here you, yo, where my hatchet-swingers?(RIGHT HERE!) 
 When the hatchet attacks, it's known to split backs 
 Runnin' rabid through your hood like a rabid Hulkamaniac 
 In the blink off an eye, we get the bitch slappin' 
 Ain't no time for fuckin' around, we make it happen 
 I make it HAPPEN! 
 With no questions asked 
 I make it HAPPEN! 
 Like it's my only task 
 I'm sick of the truth 
 And I'm sick of the lies 
 It's about to happen, NOW 
 Juggalos, all right! 
 I make it HAPPEN! 
 Since the day of my birth 
 I make it HAPPEN! 
 For all it's worth 
 I'm sick of the truth 
 And I'm sick of the lies 
 It's about to happen, NOW 
 Juggalos, all right! 
 HAPPEN!(x3) 
 Now, all right! 
 Happen!(x3) 
 Now, all right! 
 Oh my God, are you going to let me die like this?
