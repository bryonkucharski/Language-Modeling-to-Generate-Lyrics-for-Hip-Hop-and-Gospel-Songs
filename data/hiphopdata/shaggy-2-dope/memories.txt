What the deal though? Don't tell me that I'm fine, 
 I listen to your memories but none of them are mine. 
 I don't recall it, I don't remember your name, 
 The people waiting in the hall, to me, they're all the same. 
 Fuckin' nobodies, and I'm a nobody to them, 
 I don't remember your photos, don't show me those again. 
 This bitch sayin' I love her, she don't ring a bell, 
 I don't remember my opinion, as she's hot, it's hard to tell. 
 So all bets are off, and all my debts, you can forget them, 
 'Cause my memory is wiped out flat from the beginning. 
 I don't represent nothing, I don't come from any hood, 
 I'm sick of strangers all up on me, dammit, don't do any good. 
 I never ever look back again, or rec-a-leck, 
 I don't remember you either bitch, don't wanna wreck your neck. 
 Just leave me alone and let me start a new tomorrow, 
 I don't even want the shit the shit I let you borrow. 
 Keep it all. 
 Like that, every thought I thunk was all mine, 
 Cleaned out mind, wait, it's lost, I can't find. 
 Like that, every thought I thunk was all mine, 
 Cleaned out mind, wait, it's lost, I can't find.

 It took me to somebody's house, I'm laying in somebody's bed, 
 Staring at a lightbulb, eyes sunk in my head. 
 How'd the fuck did this happen, what the fuck is my name? 
 Are there really memories that are tucked into my brain? 
 It's all the same to me though, it's all a game to me though, 
 There's people stoppin' by and sayin' "Hi", relays to me, yo. 
 I don't remember my style, I don't recall nothing at all, 
 Was I rap, rock, hippie shit, or pop, who to call? 
 Who to lean on? Every night I dream the same rerun, 
 The back of my eyelids, the only memory I'm seeing. 
 Paralyzed in the brain, they telling me so many stories, 
 I'm just staring at their lips movin', lost in Purgatory. 
 It's all blah blah blah then we blah blah bleh, 
 Fuckin' more words pouring outta head after head. 
 I quit listening, I flip 'em the bird, and fall asleep, 
 I ain't even fuckin' sure what fuckin' language I speak. 
 Like that, every thought I thunk was all mine, 
 Cleaned out mind, wait, it's lost, I can't find.

 Like that, every thought I thunk was all mine, 
 Cleaned out mind, wait, it's lost, I can't find. 
 Did I have favorites, or anything I hated? 
 Who did I love, and why's it all disintegrated? 
 My memory was born today, this ain't even my life, 
 They're tellin' me it's where I belong, but they ain't right. 
 Put me lost in the forest alone, in a cabin, 
 'Cause all there ever was for me is gone, I can't have it. 
 I don't wanna live in this kid's life anymore, 
 Therefore, fuck you, show me out of the door. 
 Like that, every thought I thunk was all mine, 
 Cleaned out mind, wait, it's lost, I can't find.

 You know these two girls was seated in a theater 
 And this one girl said to the other 
 "This fella next to me is masturbating" 
 Her girlfriend said 
 "Well, just ignore him" 
 She said 
 "I can't, he's using my hand" 
 Hahahhahaha!
