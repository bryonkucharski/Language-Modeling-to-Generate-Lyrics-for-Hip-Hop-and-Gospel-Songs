What... What?! 
 Fuck... if you won\'t tell me what it is... 
 All right... now... fuckin\' greedy motherfucker, bitch! 
 You\'re in me... (Take me out this dirty attic) 
 You\'re in me... (Clean the cobwebs out my attic) 
 You\'re in me... (Take me out this dirty attic) 
 You\'re in me... (Clean the cobwebs out my attic) 
 Cold sweats, shake \'em off 
 I\'m dry heavement, chokin\' on blood clots 
 Hallucinations are comin\' to real life 
 Reflects of my face in the back of a butcher knife 
 Time after time, in the middle of the night 
 I stare at the ceiling, but I lose sight 
 I said my prayers, and I tuck myself in tight 
 But my bed still shakes, somethin\' ain\'t right 
 Oh shit, it\'s Claude, I tend to forget 
 It\'s way past midnight and he ain\'t ate yet 
 No way, Dick, I\'m almost out of pills 
 And you already went through my past 3 refills 
 Don\'t tell me what to do, bitch, I\'m on it 
 I still got that puff from last week in the closet 
 Good, he\'s straight, that\'s just fine 
 But what the fuck am I supposed to do in the mean time. 
 You\'re in me... (Take me out this dirty attic) 
 You\'re in me... (Clean the cobwebs out my attic) 
 You\'re in me... (Take me out this dirty attic) 
 You\'re in me... (Clean the cobwebs out my attic) 
 Coffee shop opens, I\'m already in the corner 
 Sippin\' my latte, with crushed up sugar powder 
 I\'ve been up for days, can barely see through the crust 
 Infest in my eyes, my skins pale and flush 
 Only times in my life I recall being happy 
 Rubbin\' the hotties, tap a little nappy 
 Insanity setup, I try to catch me 
 My walls came crumblin\', reality slapped me 
 Everywhere I look, there\'s no sign of my soul 
 So my sights are set to feel that empty hole 
 That is where he comes in, yeah, him again 
 Claude mastered the art of body disposing 
 He don\'t want shit but a little snack 
 His belly gets full, and me, I get my life back 
 So hopefully, today, like all the years past 
 I pick the right guide and avoid a bloodbath 
 You\'re in me... (Take me out this dirty attic) 
 You\'re in me... (Clean the cobwebs out my attic) 
 You\'re in me... (Take me out this dirty attic) 
 You\'re in me... (Clean the cobwebs out my attic) 
 You... You... You 
 It\'s always about you, ain\'t it? 
 Not this time... Not this time! 
 This time is about me, me, ME! 
 Medications wearin\' off, I hear sirens 
 Yellin\' in loud speakers, and screechin\' tires 
 Quit playing, Claude, I ain\'t fuckin' around 
 A billyclub bounced off my head and laid me out 
 A week must\'ve passed, hmm, I suppose 
 I\'m in a dank ass, padded room with no clothes 
 Shackled to the floor, you call this the bone 
 This may be Hell to you, but I\'m right at home 
 You\'re in me... (Take me out this dirty attic) 
 You\'re in me... (Clean the cobwebs out my attic) 
 You\'re in me... (Take me out this dirty attic) 
 You\'re in me... (Clean the cobwebs out my attic) 
 You\'re in me... (Take me out this dirty attic) 
 You\'re in me... (Clean the cobwebs out my attic) 
 You\'re in me... (Take me out this dirty attic) 
 You\'re in me... (Clean the cobwebs out my attic)
