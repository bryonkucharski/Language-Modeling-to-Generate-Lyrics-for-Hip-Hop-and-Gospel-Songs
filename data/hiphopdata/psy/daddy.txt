I got it from my daddy 
 Daddy 
 I feel nice, you look nice 
 척 보면 압니다 어머나 땡잡았스 
 Don't think twice, 이미 게임 끝났스 
 You'll be my curry, I'll be your rice 
 My name is P-S-Y, 한국말로 박재상 
 너의 아련한 눈동자에, 빠져서 헤엄치고파 
 오빠 달린다 꽉 붙잡아 언니야 
 나는 아름다운 아가씨의 동반자 
 Hold up, wait a minute 
 지금부터 선수끼리 
 밤이 아까워, turn up louder 
 불타오르는 아름다운 그대여 
 How you like me now? 
 How you like me now? 
 How you like me now? 
 How you like me now? 
 Hey, where'd you get that body from? 
 Where'd you get that body from? 
 Where'd you get that body from? 
 I got it from my daddy 
 I got it from my daddy 
 I got it, got it 
 (Hey, where'd you get that body from?) 
 I got it from my daddy 
 I got it from my daddy 
 I got it, got it 
 (Hey, where'd you get that body from?) 
 I got it from my dad, dad, dad, dad, dad 
 Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad 
 Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, daddy 
 I got it from my dad, dad, dad, dad, dad 
 Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad 
 Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, daddy 
 I'm on fire, take you higher 
 넌 한폭의 명작 난 아낌없는, buyer 
 Don't be a liar, 까고 말해봐요 
 I be your honey, never expire 
 낮에는 잠만 자 밤이 오면 상남자 
 척 보면 압니다 너무 좋아서 뻑이 가 
 널 보자마자 나, 신나면 어린애 입니다 
 오빠가 오방가 깜빡이 안 키고, 훅 들어갑니다 
 Hold up, wait a minute 
 지금부터 선수끼리 
 밤이 아까워, turn up louder 
 불타오르는 아름다운 그대여 
 How you like me now? 
 How you like me now? 
 How you like me now? 
 How you like me now? 
 Hey, where'd you get that body from? 
 Where'd you get that body from? 
 Where'd you get that body from? 
 I got it from my daddy

 I got it, got it 
 (Hey, where'd you get that body from?) 
 I got it from my daddy 
 I got it from my daddy 
 I got it, got it 
 (Hey, where'd you get that body from?) 
 I got it from my dad, dad, dad, dad, dad 
 Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad 
 Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, daddy

 Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad 
 Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, daddy 
 Listen, my papa was a superman, hey 
 그대로 받아왔어 그 몸매, hey 
 신사이길 거부하는 신사 
 이 구역에 미친놈은 바로 나, hey 
 I got it from my dad, dad, dad, dad, dad 
 Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad 
 Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, daddy
