 Mind right, money right 
 Enjoy yourself tonight 
 I lost my phone, and I'm about to lose my voice tonight 
 I say I, I, I should be your choice tonight 
 I say I, I, I should be your choice tonight 
 Mind right, money right 
 Enjoy yourself tonight 
 I lost my phone, and I'm about to lose my voice tonight 
 I say I, I, I should be your choice tonight 
 I say I, I, I should be your choice tonight

 Gold chain, Magnum style 
 My homies gang bang, Gangnam Style 
 My money long like beach towels 
 They judging me, but I ain't on trial 
 I'm a Hot Boy, you barely mild 
 My flow hard like it's around 
 I take her down 'til she tap out 
 Sorry I'm gonna call you Mrs. Childs 
 I speak that Guapanese 
 We lightin' up that broccoli 
 I play with money, that's Monopoly 
 I don't believe in monogamy 
 Motherfuckin' star, I'mma need my spacers 
 Made a half a million today, ain't got no time for no fuckin' haters

 You sexy and you know it 
 Clap your hands, drink some Moet 
 Ballin so hard, but we don't need no refs 
 I took the elevator and used no steps 
 You think you sexy baby, put your hands high 
 I'm the bomb baby, landmine 
 And I like shoppin' in my spare time 
 You sexy and you know it 
 Clap your hands, drink some Moet 
 You sexy and you know it 
 Clap your hands, drink some Moet
