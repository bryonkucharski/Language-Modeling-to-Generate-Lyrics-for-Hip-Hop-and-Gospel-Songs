Russia, it's a world wide 
 You can catch me in Russia 
 At a millionaire's night 
 Nah I ain't no Russian 
 But I get what I like 
 Baby know Russian 
 I'ma tell you what I want 
 Girl it's on tonight 
 You got me trippin' off them strobe lights 
 You know this vodka got me feeling right 
 Just one more drink I take you home tonight 
 And we can go from the bed to the floor 
 From the window to the wall 
 No matter where we are, we can do it all night 
 From the bed to the floor 
 From the window to the wall 
 No matter where we are, we can do it all night 
 So where you wanna go baby girl, no I don't care 
 Any universe, any atmosphere 
 Clock say 1:12 so we're outta here 
 We can do it everywhere 
 She throwing up dubs screaming west side 
 I got a Cali king you can fit just right 
 Pick cars depending on what's the best drive 
 Give you the keys, let you test drive 
 Top floor, with the sweet sounds great 
 Looking out the window over the tristate 
 She come mad early and leave mad late 
 And I ain't eating at the table, don't need no plates 
 Her clothes in the bedroom floor, 
 We're not even in the bedroom no more 
 I get a text message in the morn 
 Like daddy, go ahead and to me like that tonight 
 Girl it's on tonight 
 You got me trippin' off them strobe lights 
 You know this vodka got me feeling right 
 Just one more drink I take you home tonight 
 And we can go from the bed to the floor 
 From the window to the wall 
 No matter where we are, we can do it all night 
 From the bed to the floor 
 From the window to the wall 
 No matter where we are, we can do it all night 
 Baby we can go from the hallway to the backroom 
 Go upstairs, back down soon 
 My couch's soft, my floor too 
 We can take a day if you want too 
 Turn john like TV, HD, 3d 
 I spin you around like a CD 
 Baby don't make it so easy 
 She won't let, 
 She wrecking my place like Tasmanian devil 
 I'm giving the base, she giving the treble 
 And we turn it up, to the next level 
 I told her we can do it when the sun's up 
 Or we can get it in when the sun's down 
 Or maybe we can meet halfway 
 Either way, baby girl I'ma put it down 
 Girl it's on tonight 
 You got me trippin' off them strobe lights 
 You know this vodka got me feeling right 
 Just one more drink I take you home tonight 
 And we can go from the bed to the floor 
 From the window to the wall 
 No matter where we are, we can do it all night 
 From the bed to the floor 
 From the window to the wall 
 No matter where we are, we can do it all night.
