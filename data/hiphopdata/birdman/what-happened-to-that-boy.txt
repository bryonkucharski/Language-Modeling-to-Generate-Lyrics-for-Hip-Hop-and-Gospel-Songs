(Baby (talking with echo)) 
 Aye, Aye, Aye, Ya 
 Tot' 'em up, light it up nigga 
 Birdman motherfucker 
 Clipse, VA, NO nigga 
 What you smelt 
 Coke'll leave plastic 
 Get off the border motherfucker 
 Come on little'n handle your business for me boy 
 (Chorus: Pusha T & (Pharrell) (2x)) 
 (Brrrrrrrrrrr) What happened to that boy (yo) 
 (Brrrrrrrrrrr) What happened to that boy 
 (Brrrrrrrrrrr) What happened to that boy 
 He was talking shit we put a clap into that boy 
 (Malice) 
 Whoa... Yeah... Malicious... Yeah 
 I heard they snitchin' on a player man say it ain't so 
 Even as a young'n they consigned me to blow 
 WHICH EXPLAINS why I'm worth my weight in gold 
 While they was taking baby steps from an 8th to an O 
 Word in the streets that can envy as me 
 Enough ice on that watch to make a nigga lose sleep 
 Magnified face help the bitch see clearly 
 9 on the waist hit the bitch up severely 
 I'm kNOWN for the flip of that cokAINA 
 I'm heavy in the street like the 7 series BEEMA (BMW) 
 Man, hit 'em with the Nina man 
 Or that 4/5th guaranteed to lean ya man (Whoa) 
 I'm the reason that your block is vacant 
 Malicious will hit ya just to make a statement 
 Bitch! Clipse and Cash Money who ain't rich 
 Don't compare me to you nigga you ain't this (Whoa) 
 (Baby) 
 Aye... Aye... Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye... 
 Stunna and Patty Cake the worldwide Pusha (get this money) 
 Birdman nigga leave the guns in the busher (cuff 'em up, let 'em up bitch) 
 Been shittin' up bricks unload 'em to Gucci 
 Boss of the ghetto with the round shape cookie 
 Shit one, Dro one nigga flood the block 
 If I don't go to jail niggas birds gone flop 
 Nigga sittin' on the toilet bitch get off the pot 
 The bird just landed so the hood gon' rot 
 New whips, big chips the Prada Gucci shit 
 But mami your fly Benz the wide skinny lips 
 She takes my flight she holds my weight 
 While the po-po staked out from state to state 
 It ain't nuttin to a baller baby 
 Pay the cars, big money, heavy weight, bird man, hood boss 
 Baby steppin on my line I'll show a little somethin' 
 They callin' you don't come out then the black crow will touch ya (touch ya) 
 (Pusha T) 
 Ughhh... Another soul lost 
 Had to make a shirt match my ox blood colored Porsche 
 Ughhh... The rims match of course 
 Blood hit his Timbs it reminded me of them 
 Glistenin' wrist on chiller 
 Gun in the same palm of gorgeous killer 
 I put this on my lord my niece was 4 when she felt chinchilla 
 I past the shore for that shit that made fiends rise from the dead like 
 Thriller 
 Gangster... Hustler 
 At night still found time to kiss my mother 
 Live like I'm dreamin' kick my feet up 
 Gun pulled my waist remind me of my demon 
 So quite ya yappin' fore I get to clappin 
 And have your body parts mix and matching fella 
 (Baby (talking)) 
 Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye, there it is nigga, there you have it 
 Birdman, Clipse you under-smelt, VA you know 
 Uptown nigga, we go anywhere with this bullshit 
 We flip bricks you under-smell (gangster motherfucker) 
 Aye nigga put this puzzle together 
 Aye Pharrell you did this year (you did it nigga) 
 A 1000 pieces puzzles (startrak) 100, you know 
 Let's get this money (get the money) 
 Hey nigga I smell somethin', coke'll leave plastic bitch 
 Get money motherfucker 
 However you want it you can get it pimp 
 From gangster to blood nigga, take it how you want it nigga 
 We did it how we live, ain't nothin' but the thug thing nigga 
 Money thing motherfucker
