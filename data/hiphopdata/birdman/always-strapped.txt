I'm always strapped when I hit the club 
 Niggaz give me daps, bitches give me hugs 
 And since I'm paid 
 Niggaz be muggin' me, you know I'm muggin' back 
 Niggaz be muggin' me, you know I'm muggin' back 
 Yezziirr 
 Check me out, look 
 26 inches, bitch I'm sittin' crooked 
 Old school Chevy, faster than the silver bullet 
 Strawberry paint, seats vanilla puddin' 
 2 bitches, gon' and eat each other's pussy 
 Top chopped sent da car to the barbershop 
 My driveway looks somethin' like a parkin' lot 
 I'm so unorthodox, I got your bitch 
 Ridin' my dick wit no shocks 
 (Bounce bitch, bounce, bounce) 
 I'm the hottest shit jumping out the coffee pot 
 Man, I'm just tryin' to get my spot like a polka dot 
 Lil' kush make my eyes and my shoulders drop 
 Lil' syrup and I can make a soda pop 
 Keep talkin' 'n' I can make my soldiers pop 
 Real niggaz wit me ridin' till the motor stop 
 I got these hoes straight livin' out the soap op 
 I got a couple like a coke top 
 Okay 
 Always strapped when I hit the club 
 Niggaz give me daps, bitches give me hugs 
 And since I'm paid 
 Niggaz be muggin' me, you know I'm muggin' back 
 Niggaz be muggin' me, you know I'm 
 Always strapped when I hit the club 
 Niggaz give me dap, bitches give me hugs 
 And since I'm paid 
 Bitches be lovin' me, they know I love 'em back 
 Bitches be lovin' me, they know I love 'em back 
 Yeah shorty, the last MOB 
 Flying in the Bugati with a coolin' on the seat 
 Put the K in the car while we ridin' blazed 
 Put the chopper on the pussy in the driveway 
 Bet the house on the youngen 'n' we got paid 
 Triple colors on the bikes 'n' the new Mercedes 
 Bustin' keys on they ass while we got paid 
 But my tens ridin' hot to an open bay 
 Uptown made man out the hard way 
 Crap in the bucket 50 shots bitch make a way 
 I thought they knew shorty 
 Like father like son 
 Ball till ya fall stuntin' with them paper plates 
 Throwin' hundreds on them hoes while we eatin' stakes 
 We in the club poppin' bottles like 'erday 
 We grind for the shine nigga gettin' big money 
 Got a fleet tossin' chicken nigga get cake 
 I'm on his island with this power like Scarface 
 I'm in the Impala dropped top chawwnky 
 Ice man, Birdman, rockin' red monkeys 
 All ready nigga, neighborhood superstars 
 All we gon' ball till we fall bitch 
 Always strapped when I hit the club 
 Niggaz give me daps, bitches give me hugs 
 And since I'm paid 
 Niggaz be muggin' me, you know I'm muggin' back 
 Niggaz be muggin' me, you know I'm 
 Always strapped when I hit the club 
 Niggaz give me daps, bitches give me hugs 
 And since I'm paid 
 Bitches be lovin' me, they know I love 'em back 
 Bitches be lovin' me, they know I love 'em back
