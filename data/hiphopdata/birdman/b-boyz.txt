Talk about it, make 'em talk about 
 Life to me is currency, prosperity, I got it 
 And your life to me is lifeless, like its livin' on life support 
 I license everything in my wallet, lightest boy with the biggest heart 
 Nigga play your part or parallel park your ego, next to me and violence 
 Next to me is definitely no one, I'm one of one 
 And I musta won that from anybody who had it, or better yet forgot it 
 Mack in the back of a 'Lac, with a mac in the back of the 'Lac 
 With a latch on the back of the trunk 
 Hit a punk in the back with a pump, in the back, till he's off balance 
 And I'm back in the front of the front of the future when you are mentioning talent 
 And I'm in the back in the back of the block with a cop, wanna cop anybody's allowance 
 Iraq on the block, he watch for the block or whatever 
 And cut, no cut, more guns, more guts, fuck boy, you fucked up twice, you fuck, consider you drownin' 
 Die in a lake with a date with a catfish, back flip head first smilin' 
 C-cry in the face of Jesus, we just pray we keep on stylin' 
 On you bitches, TDE, YMCMB business, bitch 
 Okay nigga riding in a May-be, and I'm probably with baby 
 Don't talk nigga fuck you pay me, intercept your bitch like Bailey 
 Okay big money on this side, 100 grand for the whip my bitch drive 
 Need a new save money getting too high, dead presidents all in my Levis 
 Boy I swear this nigga be swagging, and I'm living lavish 
 Might cop me an Aston, Martin on 'em 
 Anything I drive I own 'em, bad bitch and that ass ain't normal 
 Gotta put that pound game on her, beat it up she deep in a coma 
 I'm super paid, 2 shows a day 
 My rollie gold, no time to waste 
 What it do Berg, my fuckin' brother 
 Keep that pistol by me like my lovely momma 
 Hot as the summer, cold as the winter 
 Stay on them charts, I heard that they plotting my timber 
 Young nigga, got a lot of flows 
 Any nigga don't believe me, I make it look easy easy out of control 
 Box full of choppers, hand on the trigger 
 Uptown gangsta, get it how we get it 
 Third Ward soldier, suicide rider 
 Militant minded, hundred mill on the counter 
 Hand pearly rug nigga, flame on the Bugatti 
 Christian Louboutin, Chanel for my models 
 Higher than Bugatti nigga, fishing on the fish scales 
 Nose diving for them hundreds, strapped up making mail 
 Fr-fresher than I been before 
 Higher than we even been, shining on them 24's 
 Junior doing time ho 
 On the grind ho, while he doing time ho 
 Ya know! 
 The time is money and money still was made baby 
 Eight months ain't stop nothing nigga 
 It's like jail was third base and my lil' nigga still came home, ya understand 
 I'm from the hood where bitches hold coke in they baby diapers 
 That's why when the babies grow up damn they be like us 
 I came a long ways from rhyming up in crazy cyphers 
 Man I'm so happy my lil' brother came home from Rikers 
 Shout out to BP, Thugga, Flow and Fail Boy 
 My flow Lucifer, I spit hell boy 
 My heart numb, ain't no pain I can't withstand 
 And I hold my niggas down boy like a kickstand 
 Get off my nuts, stop acting like a bitch fam 
 Lil' nigga finish puberty, grow ya own dick damn 
 I went from watching time fly on Earl and Red porch 
 To cruising through the streets of Miami in a red Porsche 
 Me and Stunna fly, we should join the Air Force 
 Stand up niggas, the fuck you brought them chairs for? 
 I went from making money from people with crack habits 
 To thanking God I'm in a whole 'nother tax bracket 
 Amen
