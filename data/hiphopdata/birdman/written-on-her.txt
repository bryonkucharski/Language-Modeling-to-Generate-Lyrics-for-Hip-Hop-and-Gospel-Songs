Yeah, she got it written on her, her swag on lean 
 The way she dancin' on me, can tell that she a queen 
 Her mama wouldn't like it, her daddy wouldn't either 
 And the way she grindin' on me, you can tell shawty's a keeper 
 She got it written on her, aye, aye, aye, aye 
 She got it written on her, aye, aye, aye, aye 
 She got it written on her, aye, aye, aye, aye

 Gucci bag poppin' tags 
 New crib brand new jag 
 Birdman born to shine 
 Bad bitch all the time, stay fly, ride fly 
 I'm stuntin', stay high 
 Straight G, just like that 
 Blow 100, bounce right back 
 Red hot, hard top 
 Cash money, hard knock 
 Bentley frame, drop top 
 50 G's, the bottles pop 
 Iced out, so we chill 
 Tunin' up every automobile 
 Tatted up, life of a G 
 Counting stacks and five star suits 
 Yeah, she got it written on her, her swag on lean 
 The way she dancin' on me, can tell that she a queen 
 Her mama wouldn't like it, her daddy wouldn't either 
 And the way she grindin' on me, you can tell shawty's a keeper 
 She got it written on her, aye, aye, aye, aye

 250 on the dash, yeah, I'm livin' fast 
 Yeah, I'm gettin' cash, I need a bitch that's bad 
 Shawty play your role, we slammin' phantom doors 
 She be like drive slow, we burnin' purple smoke 
 I said I'd never fold, I promise not to stop 
 Just like my rolls Royce, the way that girl drop 
 I need a hot girl, the way the girl hot 
 Dollar signs tatted on her on her private flight 
 Yeah, she got it written on her, her swag on lean 
 The way she dancin' on me, can tell that she a queen 
 Her mama wouldn't like it, her daddy wouldn't either 
 And the way she grindin' on me, you can tell shawty's a keeper 
 She got it written on her, aye, aye, aye, aye
