 Gangsta to the core 
 Ankle wrap flamer 
 Paint your kitchen floor 
 With your whore 
 Shit you can't ignore 
 Things you endure when you fuckin' wit the boy 
 All I hear is weezy don't kill me no more 
 I hear your bullshit

 I got a positive vibe but I ain't scared of y'all 
 Get the kid nigga did never that at all 
 That rat a tat go off 
 A black kak kak kak

 She know how to stash quarters in a carry on 
 I blow outta town 
 Grass when I'm outta town 
 Uptown in the building not a sound 
 'Cause killaz don't get heard about 
 They get whispered about 
 Or you get murdered out (nigga)
