You can leave for an hour, have money and power, 
 Then turn them on and say you work at the tower, 
 You would love that, you would love that. 
 If you can leave me for an hour, have money and power, 
 Then turn them on and say you work at the tower, 
 You would love that, you would love that. 
 Nigger, get your shit together, 
 And tell the homeboys we gonna shine in the rain weather, 
 Strap up, we gonna ride tonight, 
 Cause all I wanna do is play with hoes tonight. 
 Then my rollas with my brothers speak to the eye, 
 Let my jag drop out, speak to the gold headlights. 
 Man, I'm on a all night flight, 
 On a really, I work about a hundred milli on a rainy night, 
 I'm on the hall and my brother here be resting in peace, 
 On my mama glance, on my sister Marie, 
 Man, half of my family already deceased 
 But this part of life don't mean nothing to me 
 And make all my whole city love me. 
 Fitted hatch, dance wrap, rees on my feet, 
 Ex leg, playboy, you won't believe me. 
 Besides, all these hoes and all these bros 
 How let me play, I got the things that I want to keep. 
 Playboy, you can believe me. 
 You can leave for an hour, have money and power, 
 Then turn them on and say you work at the tower, 
 You would love that, you would love that. 
 If you can leave me for an hour, have money and power, 
 Then turn them on and say you work at the tower, 
 You would love that, you would love that.
