(Baby)

 Ya know what I'm sayin' 
 If you from where I'm from 
 Ya know what I'm talkin' bout

 This is a cash money classic 
 And I feel couldn't nobody do it the way ima do it

 So, here we go world, I'm bringin' it to your world from my world 
 Ya know what I'm talkin' bout look I say

 (Baby) 
 In one you trust, the neighborhood is us 
 And everything that I ride is 22s and up 
 And every time that I slide, you know I'm platinum plus 
 Make the hood understand that we trying to come up 
 24s on trucks, just the neighborhood lust 
 Tell Lil' One be cool everybody coming up 
 Cause everybody wanna ride, everybody wanna shine 
 So how ya love that people? Everybody on the grind 
 And these projects cuts ya, ya hood rich livin' lavish 
 Those 14s, you know we had to have it 
 Once upon a time it was nothing but magic 
 Hustling right in front of my mama, Ms. Gladys 
 Chasin paper paper chasin, look that's all we know 
 Comin' through the neighborhood on them 24s 
 Bet a thousand, shoot a thousand, nigga up it some more 
 Fast money, Cash Money, that's all I know One 
 (Lil Wayne) 
 They say I walk around like I got an S on my chest 
 That be that Cash Money Piece, flow rest in the deck 
 I'ma specially set, No testin the best 
 Be in class, no pencil, no test on the desk 
 I'll make ya mouthpiece so beast like Delereese 
 I'm from the south streets of beast like Lil' Weez 
 E, F baby for the team I rep daily 
 I come to the defense like Jeff Bailey, I'm gone wit it 
 A chrome kitted, A foam pit in the back of it 
 Phony tittie bitches come home with me, get the business 
 I made bling bling, I'm like a lighthouse 
 So shut that ice in 'cause he ain't iced out 
 Pay attention closely, You niggaz can never roast me 
 Cause the maker of the testerosta knows me 
 Oh hes so arrogant, the cocky kind 
 But you always looking 'cause I'ma shine, that's right 
 (Baby) 
 Loud mics and big rims, nigga that's my life 
 Come through the neighborhood with my homeboy price 
 Let's get it understood, nigga that's my price 
 Come through the neck of the woods, you be all right 
 'Cause I'm pimpin', I'm pimpin' pimpin', I'm comin' through 
 And I'm dippin, I'm dippin dippin, them 22s 
 And they spinnin, they spinnin spinnin, them sprewells nigga 
 Them sprewells nigga, we makin' mail nigga 
 Don't need no introduction in this 
 I can grind in every ghetto, trying to stay hood rich 
 You can ask a nigga 'bout me, you know I'm bout my shit 
 I was made by guerillas, raised the hot boy click 
 'Cause I'm the birdman and I'll do you something bad 
 You heard man that I been slangin them slacks 
 That's my word man, I won't stunt nigga 
 I won't stunt nigga, I'm gonna stunt nigga, One
