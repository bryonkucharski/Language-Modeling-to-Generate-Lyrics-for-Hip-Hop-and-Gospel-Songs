All brown paper bag (Uh-oh) 
 All brown paper bag (Uh-oh) 
 All brown, all brown 
 Fill it up with ones 
 All brown paper bag, fill it up with ones 
 All brown paper bag, fill it up with ones 
 Fill it, fill it up with ones 
 (Verse 1 - Lil Wayne) 
 I got that paper bag full of paper 
 Bag full of kush 
 Big chopper, I can hit you from a hundred foots 
 What's happening Wardy? 
 How you on it buddy? 
 Them bitches checking for me 
 Tell them I'm with Swizz Swizzy 
 They call me Wizzy Fizzy 
 Holler back right now I'm busy 
 I am the president 
 You just play your position 
 And I hope that door don't hit you 
 Get up out of my office crawfish 
 Don't let them sharkies get you 
 This beat's a car collision 
 Check out my car collection 
 Yeah look at my rims hoe 
 Mercedes with them kidneys 
 Naw that's a Benzo 
 I don't pop them pills no 
 But I pop them rubber bands 
 Man I can get like fifty thousand in that brown bag 
 (Verse 2 - Birdman) 
 Yeah, nigga 
 Cook a whole, make it out a whole and a half bitch 
 Shit, Birdman in a Benz with the duffle stuffed 
 Got a chopper with a drum and one iced up 
 Them people hot around my way but we don't give a fuck 
 We on the grind for the shine trying to come up 
 A black MAC, black six, and a black Hummer 
 Them thirteen hundreds, fourteen hundreds 
 We be getting money 
 Drop it off, get to work, nigga keep it running 
 Garbage bag full of cash, nigga keep it coming 
 In my hood red Phantom, nigga we be stunting 
 Got the block blocked off, nigga we be hustling 
 Brown duffle bag filled up with cash 
 Sixteen years old with a brand new Jag' bitch 
 (Verse 3 - Swizz Beats) 
 Get it up 
 In the air 
 Get it up 
 In the air 
 N-N-N-Now money, cars, clothes, hoes 
 All a nigga know so 
 I'm from the ghetto so 
 Give me my pesos 
 All brown paper bag

 Nigga fill it up with ones 
 Hey fill it up with ones 
 I bet that she's a stripper dancer, dancer, dancer 
 Hey, hey stuff it in the thing dog 
 Damn right, I be popping my collar 
 In a all black Impala 
 Making fiends want to holler 
 Got the suede on my headrest 
 Gold on my damn bracelet 
 Hey triple gold nigga 
 Sucker I ain't riding thin 
 You want me come and get me

 Cash Money's with me 
 Like father, like son (repeat to fade)
