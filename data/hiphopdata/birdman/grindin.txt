Yo... 
 I go by the name... (I'm yo' pusha) 
 Of Pharrell from the Neptunes... 
 And I just want to let why'all know... (I'm yo' pusha) 
 The world is about to feel... 
 Something... (I'm yo' pusha), that they've never felt before 
 C'mon 
 From ghetto to ghetto, to backyard to yard 
 I sell it whip on whip, it's off the hard 
 I'm the... neighbourhood pusha 
 Call me subwoofer, 'cause I pump "base" like that, Jack 
 On or off the track, I'm heavy 'cause 
 Ball till you fall cause you could duck to the fetti govs 
 Sorry my love, what I'm seeing through these eyes 
 Biz convoys with the wagon on the side 
 Only big boys keep deuces on the ride 
 Gucci Chuck Taylor with the dragon on the side 
 Man, I make a buck, why scram? 
 I'm trying to show why'all who the fuck I am 
 The jewels is flirting me, damned if I'm hurting 
 Legend in two games like I'm Pee Wee Kirkland 
 Platinum on the block with consistent hits 
 While Pharrell keep talking this music shit 
 Grindin'! (Ah) 
 Grindin'! (Ah) 
 Grindin'! (Ah) 
 Grindin'! (Ah) 
 Grindin'! (Ah) 
 (Hu-huuh) 
 Patty cake, patty cake, I'm the baker's man 
 I bake them cakes as fast as I can 
 And you can tell by how my bread stack up 
 And disguised in this rap so the feds back up 
 Watch it, like my whip, like my chick, topless 
 Doing a buck-six with me in the cockpit 
 Grindin' cousin, I got pot for a dozen 
 Even eleven-5, if I see ya keep it comin' 
 And my weight, that's just as heavy as my name 
 So much dough, I can't swear I won't change 
 Excuse me if my wealth got me full of myself 
 Cocky, something that I just can't help 
 'Specially when them 20's is spinning like windmills 
 And the ice 32 below minus the wind chill 
 Filthy, the word that best defines me 
 I'm just grinding man, why'all nevermind me 
 Grindin'! (Ah) 
 Grindin'! (Ah) 
 Grindin'! (Ah) 
 Grindin'! (Ah) 
 Grindin'! (Ah) 
 (Hu-huuh) 
 Grin-din', when you know what I keep in a lining (Whooof...) 
 Niggas better stay in line, when (Whooof...) 
 When you see a nigga like me shinin' (Grin-ding!) 
 Grin-din', when you know what I keep in a lining (Whooof...) 
 Niggas better stay in line, when (Whooof...) 
 When you see a nigga like me shinin' (Grin-ding!) 
 My grind's 'bout family, never been about fame 
 From days I wasn't "Abel/able", there was always "Cain/caine" 
 Four and a half will get you in the game 
 Anything less is just a goddamn shame 
 Guess the weight, my watch got blue chips in the face 
 With two tips whoever gets in the way 
 Not to
