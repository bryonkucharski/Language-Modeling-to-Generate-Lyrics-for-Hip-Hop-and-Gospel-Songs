 Rick Ross 
 Ridin' big, gettin' mine 
 Two microwaves flip a brick at a time 
 Bandana on da handle ready for da whip 
 When I wear da whitest soft watch it disappear 
 I disappear in da middle of da night 
 When I reappear bet da boss look so bright 
 Fo life, dough boy, More strikes, O boy 
 We ridin' low, Gettin' high 
 80 round drum let ya know da time 
 When you see da Maybachs nigga know its mine 
 Ridin' on da 2 4's runnin' ahead of my time 
 Watch runnin' from kind, Anotha one on my mind 
 Phone bill 4 grand get ya ho in da line 
 In da hood ho niggas act funny 
 Only real niggas really get to touch cash money 
 Cool, Dr. Dre 
 I spend about 100 million dollars, 100 million dollars, 100 million dollars 
 And I came from da ghetto (ghetto), and I came from da ghetto (ghetto) 
 If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up, If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up 
 If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up, If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up 
 If ya ghetto 
 Birdman

 Don't ever keep dem thangs where ya lay 
 'Cause dem pussy ass niggas show da folks where ya stay

 Fuck around go dead broke tryin' to fight it 
 Lil Wayne 
 I, I, I all nighted, I every dayed it 
 And when it comes to my dues, I over paid it 
 Rated hood bitch, Bitch I'm hood bitch 
 I ain't a asshole, but I'm on some hood shit 
 I wish I would switch, I don't know how 
 Blood gang sworm like a red ant pile 
 Mean mug, like I can't smile 
 Like my grill big, Coast me a 100 thou 
 Cool, Dr. Dre
