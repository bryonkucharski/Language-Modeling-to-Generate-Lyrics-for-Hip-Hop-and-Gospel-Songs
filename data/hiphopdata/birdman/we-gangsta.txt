 Methomine project where I started the struggle 
 Gladis run around sams in the circle we hustle 
 K.C gave me the game, I took it 'n' tuck it 
 Nigga brought it to another level cookin 'n' cutting 
 From the half 17's, nigga 50 'n' hundreds,

 And I done did my time, I wouldn't git it, wouldn't git it 
 And got it on my mind 'cause it's money over bitches 
 All the time I'm bout mine, nigga workin from digits 
 Green bag full of cash nigga how we feel it
