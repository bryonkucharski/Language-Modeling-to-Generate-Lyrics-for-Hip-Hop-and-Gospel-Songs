(Intro-Birdman) 
 Su woo 
 (Chorus - Lil Wayne) 
 Bitch I'm from the south, the south side 
 We all ride, and when we catch a outsider, outside 
 Y'all die, we all ride 
 And when you see us we be leaning to the side, the south side 
 We all ride, and when we catch a outsider, outside 
 Y'all die, we all ride 
 Ey pussy nigga you know you ain't from the south 
 (Verse 1 - Birdman) 
 Junior 
 Catch me in the whip, extra with the clip 
 Leaning to the right side army guns big chips 
 Wine candy on the strip 
 You know how we get it when we coming with the flip 
 'Cause we running with the flip 
 And the money is a must and hoes we don't trust 
 Guns in the cut bitch know wassup 
 20 on the slab, 50 in the jag 
 Coming through the air hustling on her ass 
 Ordinary nigga with extraordinary style 
 Swagger to the ceiling nigga hustling gone wild 
 Hustling with my child 
 Blowin' out the pound, come from uptown 
 Banana clips a hundred rounds, blaaa! 
 (Chorus - Lil Wayne) 
 Bitch I'm from the south, the south side 
 We all ride, and when we catch a outsider, outside 
 Y'all die, we all ride 
 And when you see us we be leaning to the side, the south side 
 We all ride, and when we catch a outsider, outside 
 Y'all die, we all ride 
 Ey pussy nigga you know you ain't from the south 
 (Verse 2 - Birdman) 
 Careful with the swanga 
 Come and true banging 
 Kill another kurb nigga hustling but ain't hanging 
 Up on the post where the money do come 
 Got a spot make a hundred the one that do run 
 Who back up on the slab in all black paper tags 
 Ya that be the money and the Louie all cash 
 Back like I swung through, Hummer and the Benz 
 Coupe Benz 6 and no roof, Rolls Royce and Gucci shoes 
 Haha, ya digg, ya understand, Cash Money, Young Money 
 Been about be big money, get money, bleed money 
 Flip money, see money, spend big face new hundreds 
 (Chorus - Lil Wayne) 
 Bitch I'm from the south, the south side 
 We all ride, and when we catch a outsider, outside 
 Y'all die, we all ride 
 And when you see us we be leaning to the side, the south side 
 We all ride, and when we catch a outsider, outside 
 Y'all die, we all ride 
 Ey pussy nigga you know you ain't from the south 
 (Verse 3 - Birdman) 
 Catch me in the neck of my woods 
 We all good, we all hood 
 Got them thangs taped that's when I come through 
 Nigga got them paper plates money when we fall through 
 Brand new china k monster with the sun roof 
 Cherry with the lumber, birds cheap numbers 
 That's how we do it bitch stuntin' every summer 
 Born breaded soldier, known high roller 
 K gave me the game hustling into know ya 
 Always strapped fuck if they coming, better be strapped 
 Bitch a hundred we dumping, blowin' rocking jewels

 (Chorus - Lil Wayne) 
 Bitch I'm from the south, the south side 
 We all ride, and when we catch a outsider, outside

 And when you see us we be leaning to the side, the south side 
 We all ride, and when we catch a outsider, outside 
 Y'all die, we all ride
