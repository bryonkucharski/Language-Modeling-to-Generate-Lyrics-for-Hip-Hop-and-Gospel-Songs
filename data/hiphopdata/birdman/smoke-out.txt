 (Birdman) 
 What's up Chop (What's happenin' wit ya baby) 
 Nigga how you feel comin'out that project nigga 
 To these E-States and floatin on these million dollar yahts 
 Smokin' these thousand dollar Marlboro's 
 (Chorus 2X: Magnolia Chop) 
 You gotta roll that weed nigga let it burn 
 Bust then burn nigga wait yo' turn 
 Roll it up I'm smokin' 
 Roll it up I'm chokin 
 (Birdman) 
 We got weed in the mornin', weed for the homies 
 Weed in the back of the Coupe I been smokin' my nigga 
 I went from G's and thieves nigga 
 We blowin' the weed my nigga-fuckin' wit freaks nigga (hot boys) 
 I'm in that Bentley Coupe nigga 
 From Shine On video to six foot shorty too my nigga 
 And yeah we headed up town nigga 
 Blow after pound my niggaz puttin' it down nigga 
 And yeah ridin' big is my crown nigga 
 Holdin' my rounds nigga-holdin' my town my nigga (believe that) 
 To be the boss that I be nigga 
 And smoke weed everyday of the week nigga 
 On Stunna Island nigga fuckin' with them G niggaz 
 We gettin' money everyday of the week nigga 
 It's fast money nigga-Cash Money made me 
 We blow that purple everyday in my city streets 
 (Ta) 
 I'm headed to Stunna Island it's lovely over there 
 Sand in my toes feel the breeze in my hair 
 In the two piece Chenell shades and the (??) 
 Chenell beach bags where I keep the weed stash 
 And I ain't gotta tell you what the ice like 
 Mothafucker this is Cash Money you know what the life like 
 You smoke what you can, we smoke what we want 
 It's never back yard boogy, straight stock yard funk 
 The higher ponic chronic, blueberry, and white Russian 
 Get it by the block it ain't open for discussion 
 I ain't touchin and puffin nothin' give me a charge 
 I'm float with the cloud above and then go with the stars 
 Blow dro with my girl Venus on the way to Mars 
 They say you need a ship but niggaz get there in they cars 
 Uh we smoke out till we choke out 
 I'm clearin my throat and I'm at it again my nigga no doubt 
 (6 Shot) 
 I took a half a block, gettin' my ice box for freshness 
 Got half the block complainin how loud the stench is 
 Pewhheeeee pimpin' (??) purple or blue, white widow 
 Cause after a few hits ya through 
 Can't get no realer then 6 Shot baby 
 Hot like a smokin' tree baby you think I'm crazy 
 Keep the windows foggy in the black Harley 
 Puffin on Bob Marley the sticky ick-no seeds and sticks 
 Gotta love it 'bout the size of ya finger 
 Get a light nigga this one's a banger fuckin' right 
 Got that light green, red, orange, yellow 
 Got that strawberry, large cherry, bubble gum, vanilla wrap 
 You ever ask a nigga 'bout me 
 Cause them hoes know Shot blows guns 7 days a week 
 Huh picture I'm an O.G. 
 From a gram, to a quarter, to a half, to a whole Ki
