Yeah, Burrrrr, Burrr, 
 CMB always, 
 (Lil Wayne - Chorus) 
 How come gettin' money never gets boring, 
 How come gettin' money never gets boring, 
 Baby I gotta stack, what you gonna do for it, 
 Then you bring it back like the Mothaf-ckin chorus, 
 And you bring it back back back back back back back, 
 And you bring it back back back back back like a motherf-ckin chorus, 
 (Birdman - Verse) 
 Back on my set, 
 Tool in my hand, 
 Big money was the plan, 
 So I'm back where I started, 
 Back where it come from, 
 Back where we went wit it, 
 Third wall soldier out the Phantom doing big business, 
 Situations thick you got the homie toting two two's, 
 Comin' back old skool, 
 Did it like he want to, 
 Headed to the pen now he back up on the slab, 
 Big money of the ab, 
 Hundred g's in cash, 
 Brand new whip, old skool Caddy, 
 The dump truck, 
 A stash spot, 
 Then came up, 
 Its more 1's N-gga, 
 Versace sheets, 
 Serve is more money in the new fleet, 
 (Birdman - Verse 2) 
 Bought a new Phantom, 
 Suede with the gators, 
 Brand new Louis always ready to spray it, 
 Like father like son, 
 Money is a must, 
 These hoe's we don't trust, 
 Brand new trucks, 
 Shined every summer, 
 Ran wit the numbers, 
 Stash spot cool got a 50 piece humming 
 Back up on my saddle n-gga hustle for my shine, 
 Just an ordinary n-gga on a million dollar grind, 
 Big timer old skool, new skool n-gga, 
 Is more money homie, 
 More money more money more money homie, 
 My b-tchs paid Cavalli Shades, 
 Blowin' haze, Everyday, 
 (Birdman - Verse 3) 
 Flip another hundred, 
 Get another Hundred, 
 Spend another Hundred, 
 Burn another Hundred, 
 Blow another Hundred, 
 F-ck another Hundred, 
 Get big money n-gga, Stuntin on a hundred, 
 50 Whips extra clips did it for the sunshine, 
 Garbage bag full hard body wit a fireline, 
 Flip another brick, Drink a little dip, 
 Stunna Island n-gga shinin' wit a bad b-tch, 
 AR N-gga, riding skinny tires, 
 Fully loaded high when you floatin' in the sky, 
 Rockin' Gucci blades, ridin' triple blades, 
 Tax on the face, A N-gga's been paid, 
 (End)
