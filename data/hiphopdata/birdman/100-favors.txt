Swear I be sitting here thinking 'bout the shit that we've been through 
 And all I know is girl I'll owe 100,100, 100 favors 
 I owe you 100 favors, 100,100, 100 favors 
 Niggas all talk, it'll never change 
 Keep on choosin' do your thang 
 All them favors, I call her like a driver 
 Drowning in that pussy, and I'm a soul survivor 
 Vodka, hunned flavors, GT watermelon 
 She always do me favors, and I don't never tell her 
 GT yellow mango, I love to drink juice 
 Owe her 100 favors, I call her my 100 proof 
 Man I heard about an angel 
 Now I'm sitting here sippin' on the last bit of vodka 
 All I ever see is your face 
 Swear I be sitting here thinking 'bout the shit that you've been doing 
 And all I know is girl I'll owe 100,100, 100 favors 
 I give you 100 favors, 100,100, 100 favors 
 Now I'm sitting here sippin' on the last bit of chi... 
 All I ever see is your face 100 favors 
 Prices with the life, rollin' on them dice 
 Spent a mill on a flight 
 Flew back and she bounced back 
 High speed, all gold 
 Lord of the ring, we live that life big time 
 Big time, 100 times I gave my bitch the sunshine 
 Harley Davis, Harley Davis, 
 Twin came I gave my bitch a 100 favors 
 You was a college student abusing the credit union 
 The music was way too loud thought that tuition was fuckin' stupid 
 Me I was runnin' wild hittin' licks in my mothers' Buick 
 Confusing you like my style even though I was broke and do... 
 Sticks 'em up, you wanna pick 'em up 
 Inside your Civic plus the difference was 
 I wasn't rich as fuck you still would depend on us 
 And I missed a crush that we had every time when winter Decemeber come 
 And we had tempers and arguments dissagreements and senses from 
 Cupid himself, and I'm shootin' himself 
 And the paramedics wont come even if you scream for help 
 Don't let love die, you regroovin' yourself 
 I'm losing' on tool looking at you from poo hoo that's dealt 
 So when I reminisce the coupon we used to split at Baileys 
 On your mothers couch your little brother in the alley 
 You say K. Dot your things got to pay that Birdman and Jay got 
 One day he'll read what you saw, now I read for us both 
 That's 100
