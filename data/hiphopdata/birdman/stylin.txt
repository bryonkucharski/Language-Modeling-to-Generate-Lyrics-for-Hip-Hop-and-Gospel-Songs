Fever Baby 
 OK, all right 
 Brooklyn, 
 Uh-Oh Uh-Oh 
 Yeah Uh Huh 
 Bitches throw ya drinks up, Style when we be comin' in 
 Niggas throw ya guns up, Whyle when we be runnin' in 
 And all that ain't nothin', We at the bar frontin 
 Its necessary, We stays in Burburry (Whooooo) 
 You know how it go, Fox and Gav 
 In a navy blue Rov, Stuttin in Halo 
 On the I-95, Keepin' it live 
 In the hood, in the 5, Front of Kennedy Fried (Whooooo) 
 Then slide off with a NBA jump-off 
 Or a nice lil' rapper, Whoever money stack up 
 Duke, Cop a little H-Tod shoe 
 And them little boxer dudes, Get a watch or two (Whoa) 
 It ain't greed, y'all got kids to feed 
 Fuck it, All he want to do is kill it and leave 
 So, Lay low and throw the pussy like the free throw 
 Brooklyn broad and bet I keep the heat low 
 Its necessary, We styles in Burburry 
 And our walk is mean in them Frankie B. jeans bwoy 
 Its necessary, We stays in Burburry 
 And a Mark Jacob bag and a H-Tod shoe (Whoo) 
 (2x) 
 When we walk up in the club, Niggas be like, "OH!" 
 They ain't got no dough? Bet we be like, "NO!" 
 We bout our paper and all that fam 
 Rollin' through Planet Hollywood knockin' that Killa Cam (Whoa) 
 Up in V.I.P. with F.B. 
 With a nice throw back, Right below a good G 
 Now, dude is ill, I'm lovin' his boys 
 I'm all, seeing he's gangsta, I'm watching him swift now 
 They want to see us, Bitches they want to be us 
 Fox and Althea in a powder blue two seater 
 We the truth in our Juicy sweat suits 
 When we come through ya town, Every'ting shut down 
 20's with the rims, be -custom kitted Bently 
 And everything we do, They assist like Jamaal Tinsley 
 Cocky bastard, I only spits acid 
 Slept on Broken Silence, Fever bout to smash it 
 This here's a classic, We keeps it drastic 
 I'm all engaged engaged to dough and married to plastic 
 And you know how we do, Fresh pair Air Force 2's 
 With the toaster, Kobe pull over (Whoo)
