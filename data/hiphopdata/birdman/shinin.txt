See I shit on my jet 
 Never shit on my set 
 Put shit in my tech 
 Play pussy get wet 
 My shit all good nigga my shit and my hood 
 My shit bounce back like I know my shit would 
 Paper chase make money see the sunshine 
 Big time nigga put the money on grind 
 On rewind nigga set a new hieghts 
 Get money all night 
 Nigga takin' private flights 
 (Chorus T-Pain 2X) 
 You know I'm gettin' money 
 Shinin' like a sparkle 
 Sparkle like I shine 
 Bitch I'm on my grind 
 If you don't believe it look at these zero's 
 Cheddar cheese, the bread mucho deniro 
 I'm gettin' money 
 Got on the pinky red diamond 
 Red bandanas 
 Uptown soldier 
 That's how we plan it 
 Swervin' in the bentley 
 All (?) 
 Tool on my side 
 That H in the caddy 
 Duffel bag full of paper homie 
 Big money nigga that's how we play it homie 
 While some niggas ball watch'em fall 
 Watch them niggas don't fall ball and bounce right back nigga 
 (Chorus T-Pain 2X) 
 You know I'm gettin' money 
 Shinin' like a sparkle 
 Sparkle like I shine 
 Bitch I'm on my grind 
 If you don't believe it look at these zero's 
 Cheddar cheese, the bread mucho deniro 
 I'm gettin' money 
 With a leader 
 Sprite 2 liter 
 Watch with the meter 
 Nigger couldn't see her 
 Nigger wanna eat her 
 Nigga you can eat her 
 Money you can feed her 
 Diamonds with a chauffeur (yeah) 
 New hundreds 
 Milk colored new benz 
 New condo spent about 5 M's 
 New diamond teeth spent 1 M 
 New (?) and versace with the new lens 
 (Chorus T-Pain 2X) 
 You know I'm gettin' money 
 Shinin' like a sparkle (sparkle) 
 Sparkle like I shine (shine) 
 Bitch I'm on my grind 
 If you don't believe it look at these zero's 
 Cheddar cheese, the bread mucho deniro 
 I'm gettin' money 
 Shinin' like a sparkle (sparkle) 
 Sparkle like I shine (shine) 
 Bitch I'm on my grind 
 If you don't believe it look at these zero's 
 Shinin'

 Shinin' like a sparkle (sparkle) 
 Sparkle like I shine (shine) 
 Bitch I'm on my grind 
 If you don't believe it look at these zero's 
 You know I'm gettin' money 
 Shinin' like a sparkle (sparkle) 
 Sparkle like I shine (shine) 
 Bitch I'm on my grind 
 If you don't believe it look at these zero's 
 Cheddar cheese, the bread mucho deniro 
 I'm gettin' money
