And I'm ridin' with a body on the shotti 
 Stretch a nigga out like pilates 
 Catch a nigga outside his hottie 
 Snatch all da honey from ya honey comb, 
 Now the bee's keep flyin by me, 
 I'm on that piff, that pody, that shit, 
 Smokin' like vladi, spendin dough from the 90's, 
 Shinin p nony in the liming, 
 I'm diming, don't time me muthafucka 
 I'm a young ass piranha, 
 Don't get caught in that water, 
 'Cause I'm waitin for a drowner, 
 And on the corner, 
 I got packs on the counter, 
 Before ya bitch leave, 
 I make Young Mob count 'em, 
 Tryna get a dollar 
 I could turn it to a thousand 
 I'm so determined it's a economic problem, 
 Drama, 
 That's why I carry the limer, 
 Ready at any given day I bury my honor, 
 Love weed so much I try to marry... Joanna, 
 So pass the pastrami and asparagus mama, 
 I'm lunchin, 
 'Cause in my area, 
 If you got bread you better break it off and share in here-a, 
 I got his ankles, and his stereo, 
 'Cause I could get a cool buck 50 for dat and the body yo, 
 That's Hollygrove, it's Hollygrove till I adios, 
 Gotta go, 
 Gotta go, 
 Got more bags to go, Yeah! 
 And I'm ridin' with a body on the shotti

 Hot boy Wayne, 
 Since the beginning, 
 I've been in and out of some shit 
 Thinnin out the thick, 
 Living out the script for the role that was chosen, 
 But I don't want an award I'm tryna afford, 
 Back to the road in the honda accord, 
 The whole right side slam down with that raw, 
 A city supply, the city get high 
 Like, if I was cleared I woulda touched Claudett... yeah, 
 I'm so fresh like sex in the sheets, 
 But, I'm from the dirty dirty like sex on a beach, 
 The checks on my niks they match my carnesh, 
 My button up shirt match my button seats, 
 The AK 47 match my fuckin' heat, 
 Watch your fuckin' feet 'cause I'm hot in the streets... yeah, 
 A 1/4 thing is how I got in the streets, 
 I had money ever since that week... Young Weezy!
