Now let's get back on to the last part of business 
 There is only one word for that, loyalty 
 Don't forget everybodys gotta be loyal 
 That's how the business started 
 That's how everybody got togeether 
 That's how they got all these fancy cars boats 'n' this 'n' that 
 We lost couple of guys along the way 
 But we still strong because of the loyalty that we have, the trust 
 That's how we stood all these years 
 So don't forget loyalty 
 Money... all the money in the world can't buy loyalty 
 That's something that comes from your heart 
 Don't forget that 
 Don't ever forget your roots 
 Let's keep up the good work
