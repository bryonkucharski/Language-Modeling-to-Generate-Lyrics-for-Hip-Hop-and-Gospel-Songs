I have no doubt 
 That I can love you forever 
 The only trouble is 
 You really don't have the time 
 You've got one night only 
 One night only that's 
 One night only 
 One night only 
 One night only 
 One night only that's 
 And when they see me 
 They see three, C 3 baby! 
 She marks her calendar 
 Reschedule every plan 
 She knows when I'm coming 
 She's more than a fan 
 She got my tour dates 
 She also gotta man 
 But even homie gotta understand 
 She got 
 One night only 
 One night only 
 And, no one gon take it from her 
 Nothings gon make her miss it 
 And when I'm gone she'll miss it 
 Wish she never forget that 
 One night only 
 One night only that's 
 Next day another city 
 She's never comin' with me 
 I'm nothin' more than memories 
 Memories she keep forever 
 She always dream about me 
 Wish she could sleep forever 
 She get her fit together 
 She get her shit together 
 After my concert 
 She wanna get together 
 I get her on my bus 
 We chill and sit together 
 She has no curfew 
 I can take tha bitch wherever 
 Come off a bit respectful 
 I'm on a different level 
 I got her feelin' special 
 Then she remember she got 
 One night only 
 One night only that's 
 One night only 
 One night only 
 One night only 
 One night only that's 
 One night only 
 One night only 
 But... I... Can make you love me forever... 
 Baby I can make you love me forever 
 (Yeah) 
 Now all the hoes hate her 
 Tha dudes wan' date her 
 Her nigga saw her leave 
 She deal wit 'em later 
 Right now she wit the greatest 
 I'm even homies favorite 
 How could he even blame her 
 She doin' him a favor 
 She let that nigga love her 
 She let that nigga save her 
 But when I come she let a nigga take her... 
 Take her for 
 One night only 
 One night only 
 (Yeah) 
 She turnin' off her phone 
 She turnin' off her pager 
 Tell him that shit on roam 
 That nigga goin' in labor 
 One night only 
 One night only that's 
 Des niggas hate the game 
 But they can't bite the lay up 
 Then she go home to him 
 He sicker than a patient 
 He waitin' at the table 
 No breakfast at the table 
 He ask her where she been 
 She say stop trippin' it was 
 One night only 
 One night only that's 
 One night only 
 One night only 
 One night only 
 One night only that's 
 One night only 
 One night only 
 But I... can... make you love me forever... 
 I... can make you love me forever 
 Them older bitches jealous 
 Say she's a groupie whore 
 But every women in this world was you before 
 See everybody wish upon that superstar 
 But when it come true how true you are 
 You got your 
 One night only 
 One night only 
 See I can't be her man 
 And She can't be my girl 
 Oh but we fuck like it's the end of the world 
 And we got 
 One night only 
 One night only that's 
 I got a wife she knows 
 My wife ain't on the road 
 When she come to my room 
 She take off all her clothes 
 Say anything goes 
 Tomorrow same clothes 
 We prolly order movies 
 We prolly lay together 
 But we can't stay together 
 That's when I gotta tell her 
 I have no doubt 
 That I can love you forever 
 The only trouble is 
 You really don't have the time...
