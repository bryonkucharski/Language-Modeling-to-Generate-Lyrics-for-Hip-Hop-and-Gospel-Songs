We be stuntin' on these bitches 
 Get money on these bitches 
 250 on the wrist nigga we be the illest 
 We be the realest 
 See 'em be niggaz 
 Up-town soldier with the money to the ceiling 
 Shinnin' like a diamond from an eagle to a pigeon 
 Birds on the wire a hundred deep and we chillen 
 Finger on the trigger that's the up-town livin' 
 High o the sky no doubt we livin' 
 Hustlin' doin' donuts in the lamb 
 Candy on the slam 
 50 on the air 
 Hundred at the crib 
 Get it how ya live 
 Stuntin' on these bitches red diamonds how I feel
