Birdman: 
 Yeah... fresh 
 Late hours 
 I promise ya 
 Ocean city view sky line 
 Straight view bird nest bitch 
 Big money poppin' you understand 
 Talkin' and smokin' kush 
 Every day we all good 
 Chandeliers marble floors 
 Ball till ya fall 
 Ball till ya fall 
 Gucci Mane: 
 Some of you gunna love this 
 And some of you gunna like this 
 I'm ballin outta my mind 
 So I mite need a psychiatrist 
 I'm ballin bitch ballin bitch 
 Sources to new orleans bitch 
 The shawtys with the stupid 
 Looks my watch looks like it's 
 Crawlin bitch I don't get no touch 
 Downs and I don't have a crossover 
 I cross the country in your city 
 Touch down and itsz ova I ball 7/24 ain't 
 No need to pause I ball 
 When leave the store I shake down the mall 
 I'm a dog fuck her like a dog treat her 
 Like a dog I'm a blob I'm a fuckin' 
 Slob write that in your blog 
 Me and baby ain't no maybe ain't 
 No probably a certain you ain't 
 Workin then you hurt playboy 
 Push it back I close the curtains 
 Bitch bitch ball till you fall bitch bitch ball till you fall bitch 
 Aligator kush niggas smoking out the pound
