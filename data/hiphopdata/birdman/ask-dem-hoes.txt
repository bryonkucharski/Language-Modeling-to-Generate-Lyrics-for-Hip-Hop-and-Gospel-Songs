 She caught it like it was a routine pop fly 
 I'm dope boy fresh new jeans new everything dem 
 Bitches want me like a wedding ring 
 I told her dat I'm married to the money 
 Committed to the cash all I see is pussy, titties, and the ass 
 Call me Wezzy F. bitch I'm straight from the street 
 Dope game is sour and the dope is sweet

 Hit you from 100 feet we don't even have to meet 
 Ya bitch love me we don't even have to meet 
 But if I run into her believe me I will hold on... 
 Ya bitch love me we don't even have to meet 
 But if I run into her believe me I will do her 
 And if that bitch bitch is crazy believe I will sue her 
 Got some hungry ass lawyers that would eat her up and chew her 
 I don't know why you love her I wish I never knew her 
 She only give me brain she was just another tutor 
 She blow my whole band I was just another tuba 
 Now get off my dick and get lost in Aruba 
 Its money over bitches cash money over bitches young money over bitches 
 Get money from them bitches
