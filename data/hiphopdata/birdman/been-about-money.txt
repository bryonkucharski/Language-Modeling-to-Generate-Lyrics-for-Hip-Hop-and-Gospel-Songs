Yeah 
 Lookin' out the window of a heli-chopta over city lights 
 Makin' it rain, makin' it snow 
 Sunshine... 
 Been about cash 
 Been a, been about cash 
 Been a, been about money 
 Been about money 
 Been about cash 
 Been a-, been about cash 
 Been a-, been about big money

 Hundred on the stack 
 Rubbers on the band 
 Van full of kush 
 Guns in the lamb 
 Dumpin' moving fast 
 Mo money then I seen 
 Louie was the tag, the duffel bag and the jean 
 Bald eagle shit 
 Fly born rich 
 Filthy with the grind, come from flippin' bricks 
 Customize shit, foreign fly red bitch 
 The leather stay soft 
 The head line stitched 
 Blowin' out the bound another show some mo money 
 Flip another hundred see we do this every summer 
 Brand new harley 
 Keep some extra clips 
 Keep some extra diamonds 
 Keep some new whips

 Bottom of the shit 
 Everyday the same story; 
 Bull shit ain't shit 
 So everyday the same story 
 More money is the shit 
 Everyday the same story 
 Headline cash money sign

 Money is a must 
 We did the high life 
 Fully loaded 'round this bitch just the cash money life 
 In broad day light see we do it when we see it 
 You can put that on my hood: YM/CMB 
 Livin' legend livin' good 
 Marble on the wood 
 Spendin' how you feel nigga nothin' when your good 
 The game on the wood

 Poppin' (?) and we ridin' cherrywood 
 Master of my piece 
 Got the time on my watch 
 Cartier is the piece got the grind on my watch 
 Got my mind on my money so we stay up on my grizzy every time I'm gettin' these hundreds got my youngin' comin' with me 
 We push truck, phantom top, everyday, non-stop benz coupe hard top bugatti nigga hard knock 
 Heli-chopta's choppas

 Hundred dollar nigga 
 Hundred thousand cash

 Stashed in the dash
