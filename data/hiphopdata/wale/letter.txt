I'm writing you to 
 Catch you up on places I've been 
 To whom it may concern 
 I refuse to be another being on this earth 
 I'm breathing for a purpose 
 I wanna be the center piece of my entire culture 
 And I've been thinking 'bout you 
 'Cause you've done such 
 By doing such 
 I get a pen and paper 
 Write you a letter cause you are appreciated 
 I'm dreaming to be great 
 While working on my mistakes 
 You promise that's change 
 I'm doing the same thing 
 Dear Mr.Obama 
 I'm hoping that this letter reaches you 
 In good spirits 
 Lord knows you've been busy 
 But I just wanna know if I speak could you listen 
 We in the same city I was hoping I could visit ya 
 If not I'm hoping that this letter could convey how I'm feeling 
 And you could find interest 
 First off congratulations on the win 
 It's time for some change to commence 
 I gotta question for you man, 
 From an African American stance 
 Are we expecting to much from your four year plan 
 And what about the rappers 
 That happen to act like a black president 
 Give us a right to be assholes 
 You know 
 They say your name for attention 
 But little to no interest after election 
 Or the too cheap t-shirt sellers 
 That's making revenue of a name we cherish 
 As I end this letter 
 One more thing you understand your impact on our race 
 Sincerely Wale 
 P.S Eh I ain't trying to nit pick 
 But keep them cigarettes away 
 I'm writing you to 
 Catch you up on places I've been 
 You have this letter 
 Finally got excited 
 But there's nothing else inside 
 To whom it may concern 
 I refuse to be another being on this earth 
 See I'm breathing for a purpose 
 I need to be the center piece of my entire culture 
 And I've been thinking 'bout you 
 'Cause you've done such 
 By doing such 
 I get a pen and paper 
 Write you a letter cause you are appreciated 
 Like damn mama the reason I work hard 
 Not even my favorite rapper 
 You was bigger than an artist 
 Yeah 'Pac 
 I was twelve when the gunned you 
 Wish you was around now to see what I've become see 
 You never had a son 
 As if it was a literal but, 
 Years later there's still a bunch of little you's 
 Never seen you as lyrical 
 But more as a voice that the whole culture would listen to 
 Speakin' the truth 
 Like only you can do 
 It's only right we lose greatness at its pinnacle 
 I got a question for ya 
 Little somethin' to say 
 Are you still mad at Biggie? 
 Are you still mad at Dre? 
 And are you happy at the way your legacy portrayed? 
 I'm trying to do for D.C what you did for L.A 
 But music today 
 It's getting lame for us 
 They chasing fame rather than making a change for us 
 They stop being artists 
 They stop being honest 
 They want that club shit 
 Ain't no more damn mama's 
 And you don't know me 
 But knowin' you through music is going to change the world 
 In the future 
 Truly yours, Wale 
 P.S Hey how long will they mourn you forever in the day? 
 I'm writing you to 
 Catch you up on places I've been 
 You have this letter 
 Finally got excited 
 But there's nothing else inside 
 So I'm writing you this letter 
 And I can only hope that you read it if you get it 
 Hoping if you get it that you won't ever forget it 
 You won't never forget it 
 You won't never forget it (x2) 
 I'm writing you to 
 Catch you up on places I've been 
 You have this letter 
 Finally got excited 
 But there's nothing else inside 
 I'm writing you to 
 Catch you up on places I've been 
 You have this letter 
 Finally got excited 
 But there's nothing else inside it
