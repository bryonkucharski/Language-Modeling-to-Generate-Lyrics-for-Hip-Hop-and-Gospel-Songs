Yesterday I saw a B-girl crying 
 Yesterday I saw a B-girl crying 
 I walked up and asked what's wrong 
 She told me that the radio's been playing the same song all day long 
 So get your glass lift it up in the toast position 
 We getting paper like John Travolta get it 
 'Cause we focused wit it we supposed to get it 
 You know me and my whole squad we so committed 
 We not the kids cooling out on the sofa with it 
 We about to dominate the globe like Oprah did it 
 We getting paper like John Travolta nigga 
 Hip-Hop ain't dead 'cause the pulse is in us 
 I got the Everclear flow, they mimosa with it 
 We are the hope of the culture, they supposed to listen 
 And I'm supposed to pivot like I'm a forward in the league, I'm Oden with it 
 Yet don't owe them niggas nothing but potent lyrics 
 But if you ain't got the dance they revoke your spinning 
 So good rappers ain't eating they Olsen twining 
 But I'm so committed, they have grown familiar 
 With the counterfeit hitters they so-so with it, but they are Sosa with it 
 They Mark McGuire with the written, I'm Rodriguez 
 On the road to riches this is the fork I'm hitting 
 This is the trial and error era no co-defendant 
 I push The Seed every time like I'm Cody with it 
 I said the one-hit wonders pneumonia to us 
 I don't know you niggas, hit the road my nigga 
 Yesterday I saw a B-girl crying 
 Yesterday I saw a B-girl crying 
 I walked up and asked what's wrong 
 She told me that the radio's been playing the same song all day long 
 So get your glass lift it up in the toast position 
 We getting paper like John Travolta get it 
 'Cause we focused wit it we supposed to get it 
 You know me and my whole squad we so committed 
 We not the kids cooling out on the sofa with it 
 We about to dominate the globe like Oprah did it 
 We getting paper like John Travolta nigga
