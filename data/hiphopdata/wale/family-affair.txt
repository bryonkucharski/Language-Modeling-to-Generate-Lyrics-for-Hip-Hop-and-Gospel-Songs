(Intro - Sample) 
 Why-y-y... 
 Oh-oh-oh-oh... 
 Ah-ah-ah-ah... 
 Yeah this shit got me feelin' Robert Beck 
 Rather than Robin Thicke 
 Ho's, got a list, but I gotta pick 
 I'm gettin' bitches to strip 
 Leave all they clothes on, baby this ain't so hard 
 See, I'm a nigga with no flaw 
 No wrinkles in my game, this is Botox 
 And spoke of 
 I make them ho's strip 
 But keep on your clothes 
 Leave your inhibitions here... 
 I breed 'em like I'm going to war 
 I tell them killers they ain't figure what they fightin' for 
 This is your Vietnam 
 Via my strength 
 So your arms can't reach me 
 Believe me I'mma be your God 
 See, involvin' yourself is to be a part 
 And when you crackin' for the night, you don't need a heart 
 You now on the premises 
 Where rules get followed 
 My pretty works stalk ya... 
 Once guarded like the jail assistant 
 But now invisible cells around your brain 
 It's much different 
 It's much stricter 
 Believe me 
 And even when you crabby, obey all seasons 
 Whatever issues you have 
 Now speak them 
 Anything you need 
 Now you gotta come to me for it 
 Squeeze you tight 
 Forever you my bottom bitch 
 And not a fear as long as you know who your father is 
 'Cause you love me (call me "daddy") (Why me?) 
 Because you need me (Why me?) 
 You need to breathe me (Why me?) 
 'Cause I'm your family you too weak to leave me (me) 
 'Cause you love me (Why me?) 
 'Cause you need me (Why me?) 
 You need to breathe me (Why me?) 
 Because I'm family you too weak me to leave me (me) 
 I'm more Karrine Steffans 
 Than Corinne Rae 
 I see the honesty, he told me that he needs me 
 You see he loves me 'cause he beats me 
 Because he kiss every wound that he leaves me 
 From the womb, my newborn child 
 Although the route's foul, we need Similac powder 
 Hold on... 
 Simmer down now 
 It's momma's new job that provides temporary housing 
 And I'm sorry that I brung 
 You to the world 
 See your father's in the clouds 
 And daddy's in the Cadillac 
 I better get my gown 
 I'm running out of time 
 Thirty x's on that calendar 
 You see I gotta go to war 
 You too young and you don't know what I'm fightin' for 
 This is my Vietnam 
 You are my strength 
 And the reason that I'm going 
 See, with you, I never see it wrong 
 So I'mma leave you with the sitter 
 And every time I spread 'em 
 I'm dreaming 'bout 
 Us with millions 
 See me with a husband 
 No government assistance 
 Turn my back on the game and I ain't never gonna miss it 
 I kiss you on the forehead, baby just listen 
 Times I ain't with ya 
 No I am still with ya 
 Forever I am with ya 
 And never should you tear 
 And never should you fear 
 Not when momma's right here (me) 
 'Cause I love you (Why me?) 
 'Cause I need you (Why me?) 
 Right now we need him (Why me?) 
 Because he family, we too weak to leave him (me) 
 'Cause I love you (Why me?) 
 'Cause I need you (Why me?) 
 Right now we need him (Why me?) 
 You see he family, we too weak to leave him 
 You got me feelin' orphan Annie 
 More or less 
 Than the muse of a family 
 Shit, is it money that my momma want? 
 Or is it somethin' deeper, and this is momma front? 
 I know my daddy gone 
 It's such a lonely world 
 Is this the reason for you leaving? 
 Do you feel a void? 
 Do we make you feel important than how you felt before? 
 Do we kiss you on the forehead and keep you warm? 
 Shit, if I was old enough to speak 
 I'd tell you that no money can be a mother to me 
 And you ain't gotta go to war 
 Especially if you don't know what you fightin' for 
 You stuck in Vietnam 
 You see him as a God 
 And I don't know who told you, but I don't see a mom 
 I see a young teen 
 I don't see a problem 
 We're livin' wrong before your God see a proverb 
 Your little cub 
 One day a bed 
 One parent above, the other live scared 
 She need love 
 That's why I can't have it 
 She can't be my mother 
 She's always with daddy (me) 
 You don't love me (Why me?) 
 And you don't need me (Why me?) 
 This ain't easy (Why me?) 
 I got no family, you too weak to leave him (me) 
 You don't love me (Why me?) 
 And you don't need me (Why me?) 
 This ain't easy (Why me?) 
 Momma, we got no family 'cause you too weak to leave him (me) 
 (Why me?)
