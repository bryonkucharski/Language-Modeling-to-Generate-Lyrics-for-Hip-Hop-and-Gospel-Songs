Turn me... up, wah, wah-wah, wah 
 Turn that up a little bit, Dre 
 Let's have a toast, one time 
 Can you put the deuce up for the triple black niggas 
 That put forth so much foresight on this forthcoming, fifth album 
 Nigga this style is fantastic, that's why the young lasses ask for us with such passion 
 Thank God 
 I said thank God 
 I said thank God, we don't do what we used to do no more 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Thank God

 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 I tell my enemies, neighbor, I really pray that you don't fall, yeah 
 I tell my enemies, I really pray that you don't fall 
 Yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah

 Ball on a nigga, ball on a nigga 
 Too much sauce on a nigga, sauce on a nigga 
 Fuck 'em all lil' nigga, ya lil' nigga 
 Yeah-yeah, watch me ball (Wale, yo, look) 
 SLP, that may not be out for months 
 If they want a feature, they don't reach out for months 
 I may not be no type of street artist 
 See honestly, I deceive and to be populized 
 I'm tryna get my daughter five McLaren 
 That feminist side come around when Zyla there 
 Shh, loud in here, quiet girl 
 Kiss the baby goodnight and step out in riot gear 
 The city of light, city of light when the moon out 
 Criminal side, they say I'm dark Miss Luna 
 Heavenly God, I pray the squad stay too up 
 And Satan stay with y'all 'cause the fear of God too much 
 J Lorenzo, a couple bands, oh, yeah 
 Couple haters, shout out to Enzo, yeah 
 It's unbelievable what I've been through 
 Gave niggas handouts, they become a handful 
 What it do? What it do? 
 Penny phones come up blue 
 Sean John threw a bag so Folarin back coupe 
 Back to back, triple black Maybach, mad room 
 Bad bitch come around, turn the cat to Katsu, yeah 
 It's too late, all you niggas two-faced 
 All you'll ever be good at is rollin' weed and 2K 
 Or maybe Madden and FIFA, that's why I brag when I see ya 
 If my bag ain't a bag, at least my integrity straight, wait 
 Thank God
