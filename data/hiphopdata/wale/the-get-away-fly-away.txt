Uh, yeah yeah, turn me up a lil bit 
 Uh, just what's been on my mind? 
 I've got to get away, I gots to fly away 
 I've gots to get away, I've got to fly away 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Look sometimes it ain't worth it 
 A lovely outer surface 
 A pity party I'm throwin' 
 Sometimes I feel so worthless 
 I feel my work ain't enough 
 I feel they praise us too much 
 Or now they don't praise enough 
 Them niggas hate me for what? 
 One of us crazy, I'm frustrated 
 Disgusted with 'em 
 They shootin' my religon 
 So muthafuck the system 
 And muthafuck the quota 
 And hail my color purple 
 And I ain't talkin' oprah 
 It's me my eyes lower 
 I should have been a chauffeur 
 My driver's like no one 
 Well rick james, maury, jane 
 Muthafuck ya sofa 
 I mean your couch I'm jokin' 
 I'm on the couch toastin' 
 A bitch is nothin' but a dog 
 Who ain't housebroken 
 I'm in your spouse strokin' 
 What are my immorals 
 But most of the time 
 I lose my mind for divine oral 
 Y'all define normal 
 That's why they don't get me 
 And there is no chemistry 
 With joe schmo's in me 
 And those opposin me 
 Have no souls indeed 
 I'm like a parapalege 
 I don't know defeat 
 Or never felt it 
 We gon' keep going 
 Hook repeat 
 Visions of popo, visions of sirens 
 Visions of handcuffs they comin' up 
 In my dreams, stomach is rumbling 
 They say I don't never smile 
 Or never say never though I admit 
 That it's been awhile 
 You never tire, might as well as inspire 
 And he who satisfy, might as well as retire 
 Them bastards is stagnant, my path's ever lastin' 
 I've mastered this ask of me, my raff ain't practice 
 I refuse the ration allowed with these assholes 
 That naturally act like these raps is a mattress 
 To the yawners, to the sleepers 
 To be honest, I need ya 
 So my armor, can strengthen 
 So keep talkin' y'all pieces, uh 
 I beach chair, with my malibu vision 
 Eatin no boo dishes, with my soul food princess 
 By the water, au revoir to my audience 
 Left my home alone, you can call me macaulay bitch 
 Hook repeat
