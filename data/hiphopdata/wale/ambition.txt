The time is now on everything 
 Took my heart away from money 
 Ain't interested in fame 
 But I pray that never change 
 Ambition is priceless 
 It's something that's in your veins 
 And I put that on my name 
 Uh, the only hope I had was selling dope 
 Was on my grind cause times were harder than a cellar floor 
 My momma taught me never steal and never tell on folks 
 I grew up looking at the niggas that was selling coke 
 Oh, I was raised by the stop sign 
 No religion I was getting saved by the glock nine 
 By the minute I was getting paid like a hot line 
 Servin' fiends was calling, we was dot com 
 Well connected, well respected and well protected 
 Ain't get accepted, well rejected and now they regret it 
 Ain't get my message, was a signal when I was texting 
 The bitch I was calling was fraud and I learned my lesson 
 Now I move with aggression, use my mind as a weapon 
 Cause chances are never given they tooken like interceptions 
 So throw that pass, I'll be the Quarter back 
 Me and Folarin MMG gon bring that Warner back 
 Ambition 
 Easy to dream a dream, but much harder to live it 
 They gon love me for my Ambition 
 Easy to dream a dream, but much harder to live it 
 They gon love me for my Ambition 
 Easy to dream a dream, but much harder to live it 
 Look, they gon love me for my ambition 
 Beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision 
 (It speaks for itself. Define Ambition for me?) 
 My ambition to win, just to get me some ends 
 Help me pay my little rent, maybe sit in a Benz 
 I saw momma praying as she wait on results 
 It was hot in the kitchen can I wait on the porch 
 My father was missing, War Lord Oliver North 
 Life was diggin' me deeper, I kept on coming up short 
 Breaking so many laws, waking up in the dark 
 Who cut my power off? it's time to move that soft 
 Not too many options when you coming from the projects 
 Sittin' in the trap now you moving Cyndi Lauper 
 Girls wanna have fun, and a nigga with some change 
 And I doubt that ever change 
 Ambition is priceless that's something that's in your veins 
 And I doubt that ever change 
 Ambition is my shit and I put that on my name 
 And I doubt that ever change 
 Ambition 
 Easy to dream a dream, but much harder to live it 
 They gon love me for my Ambition 
 Easy to dream a dream, but much harder to live it 
 They gon love me for my Ambition 
 Easy to dream a dream, but much harder to live it 
 Look, they gon love me for my ambition 
 Beautiful music, painting pictures that be my visionf- 
 Well wishers to my opposition 
 You probably cop a plea before you cop a prison 
 I got nothing against them, they got fucking potential 
 But every nigga who can read gotta get his issue 
 Subscribe, reside where all the lions and killers be 
 And I ain't spend a minute up in the streets 
 But I'm limitless mentally, I'm lyrically MC 
 Lebron, I was heading 6 after 23 
 And family is everything and money is less important 
 Long as your mama love you, don't ever love a woman 
 I got a lot of bitches, they got a lot of feelings 
 But I got that green on my eyes 
 And that ain't no Donnie Simpson 
 I retire you niggas: fuck you and your position! 
 They play surface so slippery niggas can't even kick it 
 Y'all rambling, talking shit to these bitches 
 You know you real you don't say it 
 You know you real, we gon feel it 
 Ralph! 
 Beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision 
 They gon love me for my ambition 
 Easy to dream a dream, but much harder to live it 
 Look, they gon love me for my ambition 
 Beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision 
 They gon' love me for my ambition
