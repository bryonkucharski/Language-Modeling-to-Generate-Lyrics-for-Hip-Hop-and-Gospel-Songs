When that adrenaline get in ya system 
 I put 'em out on the quest for stardom, to be a muh'fucking problem 
 The city, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Chicago is like 
 A lot of youngins using hating as a motto despite 
 I try to give 'em something positive to follow my drive 
 Quite fast they are Bart, I am Otto 
 Abort what you talking 
 Dead beat fathers, when ya girlfriend late 
 Although I love the city, it's a whole lot of haters 
 Everybody wanna rap, everybody tryna make it 
 It's no spot vacant 
 And everybody shooting, it's really nothing to aim at 
 Ricochet 'Le, you shoot me you get the pain back 
 Yeah, my loose leaf bleeds anthrax 
 Run relay to the mouth from the brain 
 It more or less becomes Taliban dangerous 
 Hold up, hold up listen... 
 You telling me I ain't shit 
 It's quite true, constipation takes patience 
 I have that like waitress, and the game's like an indecisive patron 
 Since 'Ye I been working on my spaceship 
 Putting work, don't you see the Myspace hits 
 See Joe that's why I never say shit 
 Sensitive niggas never know how to take shit 
 No I'm not signed, I don't wanna hear ya demo 
 Don't wanna do a verse, it's really quite simple 
 I have to pull the blind on opportunity's window 
 Opportunists they are but it's nothing I can give you 
 It's nothing I can give you... I ain't got shit yeah 
 It's nothing I can give you 
 Yeah I get a message like Wale whaddup 
 I respond on the spot, my reply "nothing much" 
 They reply like fuck, you really responded 
 Then I look at my sent box and see it was forwarded 
 And not that I'm bothered 
 I just feel it is not that serious, people make it 
 'Cause I feel as an artist I am somewhat responsible 
 For making the followers feel me a little more 
 Let 'em know I acknowledge them 
 Yeah so when I can I reply to them 
 And they reply to me, but this what bothers me 
 Every other message be that blah ze blah 
 Yo I got me a artist, can you feature for all of us 
 Or can you feature for one of us 
 'Cause we from DC and we know such and such 
 We got this that, the third and that that 
 Producers and what not, and we on ASCAP 
 And we got a studio, engineers on all that 
 So if you swing by, we'll throw you a couple tracks 
 Do you know Mark, I got me this young cat 
 He sound like he young hills he compliment y'all tracks 
 I don't respond back, 'cause I ain't wit all that 
 'Cause I put in my work, you coming for all that 
 I'm grinding for nine years, a lot of the lot of time 
 Rhyming for 12 years and now I'm the front line 
 Y'all niggas coming out, Diana they want mine 
 I never knew recess, and I don't do lunch time 
 Whoever do want mine, better do what I've done 
 And this place should not be full with another man's lunch 
 This game sidekicks don't make it 
 Only good for like a year like a sidekick pager 
 And I ain't trying fake it like a psychic either 
 But the crystal ball tell me you got rappers in ya neighbor-hood 
 Well save it, guarantee you been saying 
 The same damn shit every other hater saying 
 Like my name Lil Black, got this got that 
 I'm better than Wale, yeah Wale's wack 
 Wale act like he too damn high 
 He don't write a nigga back, he ain't put us on the map 
 He on that nigga Tabi, both of them niggas trash 
 With they lil ass pants, don't nobody wear that shit 
 Aw, aw, aw... star 
 Mad 'cause if good was bad, you'd be a goody two shoes 
 I'd be the devil unmasked 
 Speak of the devil, lyrically put a gun in yo ass 
 And get to bustin' off till my words short as my breath 
 Long winded, long winded 
 Means y'all fucking with the wrong nigga 
 You are so not a star nigga 
 While I am close, I am more a Marvin a martian with it 
 Yeah make them haters mad, space modulator place them a hand 
 Live '08 80 with Durant 
 I'm a star, see the galaxy's my pad 
 And the atmosphere around me is dust and gas 
 Dusty ass rappers obviously being gassed 
 Not in my orbit, they not in my path 
 I don't really care if I'm the first to make it out 
 'Cause I know, I be the nigga that them niggas ain't doubt 
 Nah, out forest grow the Barry Farm's south parts 
 I got genuine fans that's coming out for us 
 You got friends that be at the shows loud for ya 
 I got strangers that love the way I sound off 
 They say I sound more official than them other bammas 
 They love my hip hop, so fuck a sound scan 
 And fuck a BDS, I am a CVS 
 I got it all Joe, I'm like 'em all Joe 
 So bring 'em on Joe, and bring 'em all Joe 
 Star like Eddie on Malcolm Jamal show 
 Stop wellin', don't nobody be at y'all shows 
 Swear 'fore Lord y'all lying like a barcode 
 Y'all line like part on cornrow 
 Flow like nigga head, niggas can't comb through it 
 Ya can't perm that, 'cause y'all pure wack 
 Syntax error undeliverable work, yes 
 Yes I got the city, got the 'burbs 
 Got the jocks, got the nerds, got the teachers and the janitor 
 In principle, I have the principle's word 
 The school of hard knocks get ya pad out and learn, show you where the star is 
 One cannot achieve such status on the out unless he know it in his heart, yeah 
 Correct, that I'm is, perfection as close as it gets 
 Just like a star, I'm the muse of the music of Karin 
 My music is lended to their ears, a legend where I live 
 You niggas funny as a bitch, you could be like a six on Letterman's list 
 I'm caught between D.C. and Maryland shit 
 PG resident and I love it over here 
 I'm a S-T-A-R, the one a A&R salivate for but I ain't signing papers 
 Got Sallie Mae funds that need to be paid for 
 A mean shoe fetish so I need to make more 
 If you can't pay more, Wale straight ignore ya 
 You finna pay more, for my sig-in-ature 
 And just to make sure that you got the name right 
 Say my name all the time so you know it on the dime 
 I stay on niggas mind like the 50/59, in reverse 
 But you get it every time I do the line 
 There's nothing like mine, nothing like mine 
 I don't ever take pictures, you can see me in the sky 
 I'm a S-T-A-R
