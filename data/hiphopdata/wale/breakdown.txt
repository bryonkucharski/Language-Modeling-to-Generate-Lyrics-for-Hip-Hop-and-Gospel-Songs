Allow me to introduce me 
 My name Wale don't say Wally 
 Though she pop me low, lookin' for dat beaver 
 10 Deep hoodie, extra cushion in my sneakers 
 Those SB's cost near to a G, 'cause Wale so G'd up 
 Receive love from VA to LA 
 Them Cali girls feelin' me 
 They wanna hear that DC 
 I give 'em that flava 
 That's only if they handle 
 Man it's the killer tracks 
 I'm nothing like a 'Bama 
 Party at Dream, party at one twizzy 
 Sipping the finest liquid until we finish the dizzy 
 This the Breakdown song, girl 
 You know, work that 
 This that new, from the city, you ain't heard yet 
 District of Columbia, I'm tripplin' my money up 
 If you ain't talkin' dollars then I don't see where you comin' from 
 You got that money that break - uh break- breakdown 
 If it ain't nothin', a break - uh break- breakdown 
 You know you stuntin' a break - uh break- breakdown 
 Hey hold up, breakdown 
 Come on, wit it 
 Come on, wit it 
 Come on, wit it 
 Says money in the air 
 Come on, wit it 
 Come on, wit it 
 Come on, wit it 
 Throw your money in the air 
 Is DC in the house, without a doubt 
 I'm the rapper with clout Columbians rap about 
 Oh, I think they like me, never seen my Nikes 
 Dramas think I'm dumb but the flow make them hyphy 
 So, shake ya plats, shake your dreads 
 If you ain't got 'em, then bob your head 
 That's my name don't forget it 
 It's not a game, hold your dame 
 'Cause my thing something vicious 
 I'm ATL pimpin' custom pivot edition 
 The vision is quite clear 
 Apparently I'm official 
 Ridin' in that black joint 
 Lookin' for some action 
 Outta town rapper, bitches love to hear my accent 
 Ask them, ask them they whisper when I pass them 
 Fresher than me, never 
 I'm effervescent, just ask them 
 Pants get stone, we call it the breakdown 
 We ball, that breakdown 
 No more, we caked out 
 You got that money that break - uh break- breakdown 
 If it ain't nothin', a break - uh break- breakdown 
 You know you stuntin' a break - uh break- breakdown 
 Hey hold up, breakdown 
 Come on, wit it 
 Come on, wit it 
 Come on, wit it 
 Says money in the air 
 Come on, wit it 
 Come on, wit it 
 Come on, wit it 
 Throw your money in the air
