I had a lady once stop me on the street. 
 I was wearing white shoes. 
 And she says, "I'm glad you're sticking with the white shoes." 
 She says, "It makes me feel good." 
 Take this good advice 
 If they're gonna judge you for life 
 Say we can't always be fly 
 We gon' be good long as them sneakers white 
 You'll be alright 
 Said you'll be alright 
 Said you'll be alright 
 Said you'll be alright 
 Gucci iced out, whole hood had 'em 
 Ice cream 'fore the hypebeasts that's into fashion 
 Being forreal, yo try being Pharrell 
 When your black ass in a back class, the fronting was real 
 No Lauren London, we was on a budget 
 You know, sharin' Old Navy so the army could be fresh in public 
 Where the sneaker stores and laundromats get all the money 
 'Cause it ain't 'bout what you're doin', 'bout how you're lookin' 
 When they love you for your status and your catalog 
 And everybody got a jersey to play along 
 Back then the hoes checkin' for your zapatos 
 So even dirty niggas had the foams 
 Take this good advice 
 If they're gonna judge you for life 
 Say we can't always be fly 
 We gon' be good long as them sneakers white 
 You'll be alright 
 Said you'll be alright 
 Said you'll be alright 
 Said you'll be alright 
 Biotech trainers on the way to work 
 And we would quietly complain while Eric would lurk 
 That was the PG Plaza manager, managin' us 
 Yeah I'm standin' in Lucky 7s but slingin' them Lugz 
 Still have them Js for the low, low, and I could get 'em early 
 But I'm not without a conscience, I see people out there hurtin' 
 Got 'em for Penny Foams that was bought at this very store 
 And I think that was my shift, then again I'm not very sure 
 And that's a lot that can get to ya 
 When you're not sellin' drugs but the outcome is similar 
 'Cause out come them niggas with pistols, tellin' you give 'em up 
 Now out come the moms with tissues 'cause you ain't give a fuck 
 Free lunch for everyone, income was very uh 
 On the second and 16th everyone would have every 1 
 And Reebok would carry pump, and that's not the scary part 
 These niggas love white shoes so much they'd be buried in them 
 I had a lady once stop me on the street. 
 I was wearing white shoes. 
 And she says, "I'm glad you're sticking with the white shoes." 
 She says, "It makes me feel good." 
 You'll be alright 
 You'll be alright 
 You'll be alright 
 You'll be alright 
 Take this good advice 
 If they're gonna judge you for life 
 Say we can't always be fly 
 We gon' be good long as them sneakers white 
 You'll be alright 
 Said you'll be alright 
 Said you'll be alright 
 Said you'll be alright 
 No matter how good or lavish us niggas got it 
 We just a bunch of ravenous addicts living for fancy haberdashery
