All I need is the notepad 
 Bottle of Remy I can jack down the Prozac 
 I'm so intact so I stay sharp 
 My desire to never fall leads me to hitting walls 
 It's a war with the enemy 
 Writing verses can be a freestyle or something written in a week 
 Ain't finna peak yet 
 I just cease 'em with the free; 
 It's like my freestyle's cleavage 
 And my songs when they reach they official 
 So unzip the bra be in awe from the nipple 
 It's so simple to see things from a genius perspective 
 When my competition ain't much 
 I ate lunch but the gluttony is running in me 
 I'm looking at your dinner feeling like there's nothing in me 
 It's nothing iller 
 Them emcees don't come wit' it 
 Like a tongue that don't find clit 
 Go ahead jo, go ahead ho 
 She ain't tryna go low, go head home 
 And I don't think homes 
 I just blank out 
 Abuse paper, run through it 'til the ink's out 
 Like Ashanti 
 Hip Hop's bounty, hunter 
 Young'n in the Fader like laundry 
 Hoes love me 
 Get blown like lawn leaves 
 And then I bounce like cars out in Long Beach 
 A far reach from them rap dudes 
 Yeah, them niggas spittin' while I'm dishing out a typhoon 
 I write tunes 
 I'm hoping that they dig it 
 A break from what you hearing 
 Please listen, please 
 Please listen (Gotta get the checks) 
 Please listen, man 
 Please listen up 
 Please listen, man 
 Please listen up 
 Please listen, man 
 Please listen up 
 Please listen, man 
 Fuck it, it's Hip Hop and niggas don't give a damn 
 Catchdubs you a motherfucker 
 No motherfucker dug it 'til you motherfuckin' brung it to 'em 
 Them label motherfuckers sucking every other young'n 
 They swingin' woods like the motherfuckers nun-chucking 
 Hundred running they ain't finna slow down never 
 I'm on the run, keep running 
 I should run for Kenya 
 Do not attempt to interfere 
 I am much better 
 Inferior, but I'm nice 
 I am tough leather 
 I'm advanced like vancing? 
 I could spend a whole damn advance on some kicks and some pants son 
 I'm from the zoo where the animals ain't hands on 
 Gorillas bite a nigga's whole damn hand off 
 Landover niggas running round with mad warrants 
 The feds slower than a can pouring 
 Honey 
 DC, man over money 
 Pride over dough 
 Niggas dying like it's nothing 
 I hope that, I can be the light to 'em 
 Some say I'm not the right dude to give light to 'em 
 They right too 'cause 
 They ain't say that then they wouldn't be haters 
 They wouldn't be nothing 
 Wale the campaigner 
 I wouldn't be famous 
 I'd be up in footlocker 
 The same pair of trainers 
 Same '89 Camry that needs painting 
 No LA'n no NY'n 
 No more splurging on fitteds at Goliath 
 No I'm lying 
 I'mma always give it to 'em 
 You don't get it now give it 'bout a year or two 
 I need a little room 
 They say I need growing 
 I'm already grown 
 Nigga I'm Greg Oden 
 Kevin Durant you're an ant like my mother kin 
 I goes in, this is such a cinch 
 Shit, I use the same line, like I did again 
 You're uncool like my mother kin 
 See, I'm done 
 Fuck it 
 You're uncool like my; you get, you get it by now right? 
 Please listen, please
