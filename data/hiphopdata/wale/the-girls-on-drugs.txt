Hey! Happy Festivus everyone! 
 I promise you ain't never really freak out until you be out at freak hours and see each and every freak out from free couch to free couch 
 We go deep and we don't get no sleep 
 'Cause we be up all night until the early light 
 We go deep and we don't get no sleep 
 'Cause we be up all night until the early light 
 We go deep and we don't get no sleep 
 'Cause we be up all night until the early light 
 We go deep and we don't get no sleep 
 'Cause we be up all night until the early light 
 Man these niggas ain't serious 
 Do you know what type of women I've been dealing with? 
 I used to pop blues with my lil' bitch 
 I call her boo 'cause her real one I will forget 
 I use a Uber to scoop me to SLS 
 What you expect, a little groupie to see my crib? 
 Oh no, these niggas ain't serious 
 Do you know what type of bitches I've been dealing with? 
 Try to tell me adderall make her get a rush 
 Used to use it to study until she fell in love 
 Told me that lil buzz just make her think a lot 
 Told her "Nah you lying, 'cause you don't eat enough" 
 Nah Nah Nah 
 These women ain't serious 
 She sprinkled a little something up in her lip 
 Start sipping and now she sweating, her lips clenched 
 Kind of dizzy, her friends tell her to get a grip 
 I'm trying to get me a real woman to take out 
 But for now, they're wild 
 They rather get it in 
 Girls on drugs 
 Girls on drugs 
 Girls on drugs 
 Pills and subs when them beers ain't enough 
 They still need love 
 We go deep and we don't get no sleep 
 'Cause we be up all night until the early light 
 We go deep and we don't get no sleep 
 'Cause we be up all night until the early light 
 In her purse where her hand go 
 She disperse by the handful 
 Coco make her go up 
 Nothing popping, pop a zan when she laying low 
 Bars to break, so many bars to break 
 She at the Grammy's turnt, none of the stars is fake 
 She like "Oh my God, I'm on the moon and shit" 
 And my particular moon like a platoon and shit 
 You know the niggas I be dealing with 
 Politicians and niggas living it on the rip 
 And my position to give this shit to little kids 
 Is not official unless I'm giving them authentic 
 We're all living with small demons 
 We're all sinning, it's all similar 
 Broads with us and they bong hitting 
 Let me tell you about the bitches I've been chilling with 
 The really insecure ones look good as shit 
 Nothing fill the void of a little pill 
 A little shot, she ain't shy when the shit spill 
 And it's hard to feel alive when you're feeling dead inside 
 Beside that the lime light be so real 
 Let me tell you about the bitches that I kick it with 
 Told me nobody love her and so she cut her wrist 
 Not enough for the hospital but cut it close 
 That's why she want to get high because she's feeling low 
 Told me pour me a vodka, pill and little smoke 
 So I could numb her insides and we will never know 
 Girls on drugs 
 Girls on drugs 
 Girls on drugs 
 Pills and subs when them beers ain't enough 
 They still need love
