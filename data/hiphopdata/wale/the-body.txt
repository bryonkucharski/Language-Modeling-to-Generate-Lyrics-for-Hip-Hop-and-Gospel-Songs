Baby you got a body like a Benz 
 And I'm just tryna drive it once again 
 Baby you got a body like a Benz 
 And I'm just tryna drive it once again 
 Shawty can I fill your tank, yeah 
 I start of with that "What you drinkin'?" 
 Pardon if I'm road raging 
 But I know you heard my drive is crazy 
 Yeah, let me pace that, with some patience 
 Let me do it till I fill every void 
 You're like a Maybach, thinking damn, they ain't even make 'em like you no more 
 It's like a high beam gleaming through your eye (bling) 
 I can door you up, baby suicide 
 A little wordplay, I'm hoping I can make you smile 
 Least until I'm out of line like a DUI 
 Girl you remind me of my Jeep 
 Can I see what's up with that G-Wagon 
 Can I take you off of these streets 
 To the side of me, I'm tryna see your hazards 
 Tryna be with the baddest, won't be the fastest 
 Gotta make it last, I hope you comfortable 
 I need to get to you, you're like a 62 
 A little work, then it's curtains when I'm skrrtin' through 
 Came through in the brw, tryna leave in the coupe 
 That mean I gots a few, but I believe in you 
 Tryna chase the cat, know I'm killin' the dog 
 You ain't feeling me naw, that mean I don't need the roof 
 You remind me of my Jeep, I wanna ride it 
 You something like my car 
 I got the keys to them, I need the keys to you 
 You put on a show, you don't need no clothes 
 Give me little bit more, always take it slow 
 I know you don't wanna stop, I'm tryna make it go 
 Now speed it up like a Maserati, and look at me and pose 
 Baby you got a body like a Benz 
 And I'm just tryna drive it once again 
 Baby you got a body like a Benz 
 And I'm just tryna drive it once again 
 A good woman is scarce to us 
 And I wasn't prepared to love 
 And it sound crazy, but your miles crazy 
 I'm just here cause your character good (truth be told) 
 A good nigga is rare to her (truth be told) 
 You heard it all but hear this love 
 One night with dude, I be the reason you cute 
 So let me know am I clear enough, yeah wassup 
 Way I, way I, that's the way I think 
 Shawty straight like, a concert on Bay Orange street 
 In the morning I slide over, she needs a ride I'm like 
 "Tight, let's keep it AMG" 
 Slidin' down, precipitating is straight 
 Top down, let me kiss your physique 
 I'm diggin' your flee, I'm checkin' your gear 
 Can tell you had a good year, spent a grip on your feet 
 She like when I drive it, I like it in park 
 Pull that thing over you likely to sore 
 I got her floating like riding on stars 
 So I keep it GPS, see where this going 
 Nothing will stop it, I slide in no problem 
 Ch-ch-chop it, my swipe your parts 
 Sections her weapon, my snake in her garden 
 So know when I'm not here the viper is on 
 You put on a show, you don't need no clothes 
 Give me little bit more, always take it slow 
 I know you don't wanna stop, I'm tryna make it go 
 Now speed it up like a Maserati, and look at me and pose 
 Baby you got a body like a Benz 
 And I'm just tryna drive it once again 
 Baby you got a body like a Benz
