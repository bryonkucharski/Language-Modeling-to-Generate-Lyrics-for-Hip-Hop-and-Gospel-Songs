Yeah! First and foremost let me shoutout my favorite rapper in the world: Black Thought 
 He paved the way for a youngin' like myself. 100 Miles and Running. My name is Wale. Ehem 
 Where the rollers at? Looking at me 
 How I attack beats make them jump on it 
 To them niggas who think they might want it 
 I make a couple of calls and y'all goners 
 And I'm sick and so tired, they ain't official as I 
 That's why the bitches you like be straight stalking me 
 Straight moshing partna I ain't normal 
 I make a hater fall suit like a formal 
 I make a nigga part ways like a cornrow 
 I keep a nigga in the pocket like cargo 
 I bet a congo you gon' want a encore 
 And I don't keep bitches like lawnmowers 
 They make you lack green, and I mack like me 
 Never give cheese to the meese, mice 
 Mouse, rats, I show you where it's at 
 Flow like none, celibate rap 
 Flow like battery, never will adapt 
 Flow like zippo, so unmatched 
 Flow King Hippo leave 'em on the mat 
 Flow ten zero, you ain't never had this 
 Flow like Howard - something like Magic 
 Something like masturbating I'm orgasmic 
 I am well fed, them whack niggas fasting 
 Work like a slave so them haters backlashing 
 Niggas so roots you think I was juicing 
 Jordan was cool but I'm on that Mark Cuban 
 Money like Moon it don't ever leave the pocket 
 Hoes talk money then we finna stop talking 
 I am an archaeological problem 
 Bag any bitch then I bone like fossil 
 Sorta like Nasir, something like Carter 
 Something like Marshall and Black Thought balled up 
 Fuck rap I'm an ill ass poet 
 Chill up spines when a nigga start to go in 
 Make them fly girls hot so they adamant on blowing 
 You niggas ain't fly y'all late like Conan 
 I'm on that dope shit, words worth more than money 
 I work like a slave slave till I'm stuntin' 
 So I'll be the Kunta the Toby of the booth 
 They tell me keep it coming motherfucker I'm the truth 
 Sojourner the poem is the ointment that lays 
 Of the chaise and the scars of the orchards 
 Cordially yours, I speak for the voiceless 
 Voiceless environment is speaks with the noises 
 Sound of the siren rebirth the mic with the livest 
 Light to the blind give them slight niggas sightless 
 Sorta like a domain name with no page to purge 
 Much as I urge, I can't save you girl 
 Ho's will slow a nigga 
 Down so know I vow never to go with her 
 Mics I cold kill em, Nike 450 
 I been getting busy since Back was hitting Skillet 
 I'm chillin' I'm good I'm so comfy 
 Nigga is unsigned, fans out of the country 
 The man out in Canada, plans to expand my, fanbase 
 I might move there, they got a better healthcare 
 I make that government cheese like welfare 
 You niggas out of your league like Telfair 
 You could tell Ferris Bueller I'm cooler 
 Flyest of the students and I don't see Mr. Rooney 
 I'm Parker Lewis I ain't ever gonna stop 
 D Dubs on the West so we synchronize watches 
 And I got it, homes so got it 
 Whores adore me so they niggas try to knock it 
 Listen to y'all flow, them niggas ji mocking 
 Dog, they say my style is similar to a stock tip 
 'Cause if you watch it and use what you learn 
 And produce to the world you'll look super important 
 The biggest star in the city next to Portis 
 Or Arenas you would think I'm on my sports shit 
 I'm out in South West shoutout to 106 
 Some niggas hating on me like they don't wanna live 
 I got a lot of fans, I got a couple haters 
 She got a lot of friends, she better cuff 'em baby 
 I got a lot of game I got a little talk 
 A little pimp stroll that make a bigger walk 
 So what this hitting for? Just let it hit 4 
 5 mil maybe more 'fore I'm 24 
 I mean the money cool but I ain't in it for it 
 It's Hip Hop on 'roids nigga get involved 
 I mean they spittin' false, they ripping niggas off 
 I make the track bleed, they got menopause 
 You niggas rap? Please, we ain't feeling y'all 
 They say I rap iodide I am in-salt-ing 
 And I'm far from a King 
 The King of DC? Um Big G 
 What up Slim Charles? That's my big brah 
 I'm at the Back show sipping a big bra 
 That's that old cup had the hoes so stuck 
 Pop bottles every once and while that Rosé 
 Wale Hundred Miles and Running 
 Giving them hip hop to anybody that want it 
 Something from Commonwealth that's when I'm not in a Hundred 
 If I'm not in the money I'm digging me out a youngin' 
 Lyrically under thunder the puma I encompass 
 The room full of club promoters selling my number 
 Ha 
 That's work 
 That's work 
 That's work 
 That's work with it 
 Work with it 
 Work with it 
 Work it out
