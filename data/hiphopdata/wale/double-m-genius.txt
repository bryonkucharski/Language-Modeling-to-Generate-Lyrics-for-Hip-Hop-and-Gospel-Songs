I try to tell them I'm one of the 
 Best thinkers of this class I'm in 
 Yeah, I'mma let the chips fall 
 Niggas is Kemba Walker tryna see me pitfall 
 Niggas is starring like a synagogue: think about it 
 Centerfold bitches prolly couldn't get a drink up out me 
 They say I need some guidance 
 But I think they need a stylist 
 Bitch you should see my wallet 
 This bitch gonna need Pilates 
 And you can't see Folarin 
 What the fuck are you, retarded? 
 I ain't hugging the corner, but I hustle so enormous 
 A modern day Goodfella, I'm Ray Liotta 
 Loud smoking so pass the L like a semicolon 
 The Bentley is rented but I got many chauffers 
 Foamposites if you ain't got 'em then you penny-loafing! 
 Under-rated that's temporarily for the moment 
 Only marry your woman if mama cold as Willona 
 See, I'm second to no one 
 I'm the messenger-poet 
 They slowly showin they colors 
 They music good but they bogus 
 Wale 
 They talkin' 
 Talkin' bout Folarin 
 Verse 2 gon be fuckin' with verse 1 
 Especially when you're writing shit that can never be done, Joe! 
 That Kevin Love flow 
 Bored of the shooters 
 My women be in the newest 
 Yo bitches should buy a loofah 
 Where I'm from they is ruthless 
 Babies turn into shooters 
 Crazy talking and foolish 
 You catch a shell like a Koopa 
 And I don't give a fuck, see my bitches is kama sutra 
 One of them bitches is cute, the rest of them congruent 
 Why you talking my nigga? Just go and do it 
 Niggas awful at dressing, they just a'ight at music 
 I'm trend-setting, despite of a awful debut 
 Still got me another deal because any nigga in music 
 The remedy is get your hustle on 
 Fuck a broad unless you love a broad 
 Well in that case, brother, then love her hard 
 Put my trust in my dog 
 Put my trust in my God 
 'Less you Stabler and Benson, I don't fuck with the law
