It's the perfect plan 
 So inspired, so devious yet so simple 
 This is what I do 
 Listen, these niggas is tripping 
 These niggas been thinking we ain't tripping off lyrics 
 Soulja Boy Tell 'Em did better then the regular 
 But hold the beat, he ain't speaking for everyone 
 Nah, nah, these niggas is lunching 
 If we think of success as only measured by your money 
 'Cause money never lasts, in fact it's only last 
 On the list of impactful things one can ask for 
 So, with that, we need us a plan 
 Respect has grown inferior to fucking soundscan 
 If that don't sound bad you should ban me 
 I don't give damn about grands see my mind's on a grammy 
 Admire my mind, admire what I write 
 Cause hype gets you Rick Mirer'd every single time 
 But nah, he is quite different 
 Cause his hype and talent still manage to equivilate 
 They are not legitimate enough to belittle us 
 It's them who've lost love, and love for a lyricist 
 So I gotta pitch them this, for a better outcome 
 You say the art's dying, nah brother buy a album, The Plan 
 These niggas is lazy 
 These niggas complain about Wayne, Kanye and Jay-Z 
 These niggas is bothered, these critics be talking 
 We sometimes acknowledge the beat as from 
 But rather than singing non praise the dude 
 Rasie the bar to a level unattainable 
 Niggas download that 'cause they scared to do 
 What the Soulja Boy fans be prepared to do 
 What the B5 fans get their mother to do 
 Them cowboy country singers going forever recoup 
 It ain't nothing too you, but shit it's something to me 
 I mean it's something to we, artists, it's something to eat 
 So if we come with the peace or we run with the piece 
 Giving niggas the piece of mind to put it to beats 
 Now the first week sales can't hardly compete 
 This is a market of beats, this is the end of the glow 
 That's why rappers is actors trying to dabble in clothes 
 I just rap 'cause I'm posed to, nigga this what I know 
 I conclude, buy my music no more free downloads 
 They can't steal my quotes, can't steal my show 
 Shit I bought them tracks, stupid bitch I'm broke 
 And you live with your folks, wifi-ing it up 
 Find a couple of blog sites to finish it up 
 Tuesdays used to matter now the only thing that happens is 
 You, you and you're saying "Shit, I been had that 
 Shit I been heard that niggas been working 
 Hurricane clapping, lyricism ain't working 
 I mean it's been working but we don't get support like orphans 
 So now this work's been worthless 
 Now if you give us a chance 
 They say hip-hop's dead, I believe it's just the fans 
 It's The Plan 
 It's the perfect plan 
 So inspired, so devious yet so simple 
 This is what I do
