(Verse 1: Wale) 
 DMV up, roll up and kick my feet up 
 This shit was for a ticket, man -- I call that shit that free lunch 
 I tell a ho to speed up 
 She slow and she can keep up 
 We know we always out 
 But somehow they would never see us 
 Peep her gold chain, hoes changed, I didn't 
 They say that karats help your vision 
 But somehow it made them listen 
 No this ain't silver, this is my dilemma 
 Arrogant when I finish 
 I came from humble beginnings 
 So it's nothing to finish 
 I put my hundred percent in 
 Put my pride in the pen, cuh 
 And modify your opinion 
 Trying to give them light and a message 
 But you rather have some fucking V.V.S.'s 
 She said I'm charming and I meant it 
 But she was talking about my pendant 
 I got geechi on her, came back with thirty chains 
 Now she attentive, I bet she listen to everything 
 Straight geechi on her, came back with eighty chains 
 Now them silly bitches calling me like everyday 
 (Hook: Wale X2) 
 Now them broads gon' follow 
 (Chain so big, can't pop my collar) 
 Silly bitches gon' follow 
 (Chain so big, can't pop my collar) 
 Straight geechi on 'em 
 You talking greasy 
 Best believe they gon' see it, darling 
 Geechi on 'em 
 Straight geechi on 'em 
 Let's keep it G, nobody see you when you being humble 
 (Verse 2: Wale) 
 Look, she so stingy with vagina 
 But why it open when them niggas get to shining? 
 I was hoping you would notice where my mind at 
 Put money in the book, I bet these bitches wouldn't find it 
 Look, okay this chain music, fuck how them lame's do it 
 You chained to it, your brain has been way too influenced 
 I been dope, cold nigga for sure nigga 
 But where I'm from there ain't no love for no broke nigga 
 She seen that geechi shit, ain't been to church since 
 Pray to whoever got on the biggest of crucifix 
 Lord Lord forgive us, personality clash 
 And my license is suspended, so I hide it 
 I don't spend it, did I get y'all attention? 
 She can't escape the chain, shoutout to Mrs. Tubman 
 Shoutout to Maybach Music, my logic is getting money 
 Spitting something real, let the people know, and still love it 
 Shady flow: Johnny Cage, chain flow: Johnny Dang 
 Ben Baller, six bottles, talk with such expensive slang 
 I got geechi on 'em, now they notice a nigga 
 So who that chain change? It ain't both of us nigga 
 I got geechi on her, came back: a hundred chains 
 And now these geechi mother f-ckers all know my name 
 Geechi on her, came back: a million chains
