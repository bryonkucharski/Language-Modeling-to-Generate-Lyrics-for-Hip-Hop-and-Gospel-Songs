You need to go 
 Don't look so surprised (You better sing girl, sing, sing, sing) 
 'Cause we had love 
 That will be immortalized 
 Say you need me now 
 So alone without me now 
 But our little romance is through 
 Because basically boy, you 
 You just don't know what to do oh 
 I can give it to you, but what you gonna do 
 With it, if I hit it? I bet you stuck stupid 
 Sucking your teeth, don't fuck up my mood 
 I'm trying to give it all to you 
 I can understand it's things we go through 
 Put C's on your bag, let see this here through 
 And we can be a size receipts from Nobul 
 But I gotta get it out of you 
 She said "'Le throw a ring on it!" 
 She don't love you unless she put your whole name on it 
 Gettin' money, yea this age is hard 
 Not the datin', I act a way 
 When all the pretty bitches love you but you'll stay precious 
 I miss you almost half as much as you miss me 
 You used to act so tough, bringing insecurity 
 Now that I found myself, your eggin' to be mine 
 Can't even help yourself from playing the fool each night 
 Ooh, how I loved you 
 Ooh, how I needed you 
 Ooh, boy I feel brand new 
 Ooh, since you turned me lose 
 Baby, you don't know what 
 You don't know what 
 You don't know what to do 
 You don't know what 
 You don't know what 
 You don't know what to do 
 'Cause you wanna leave 
 And you never go 
 I'ma set you free boy 
 Baby, you don't know 
 You don't know what 
 You don't know what 
 You don't know what to do 
 You don't know what 
 You don't know what 
 You don't know what to do 
 You love me more than you love sunny summer days 
 And even more than you love floating in a haze 
 Boy when you lost my heart, you lost everything 
 Now all that you can do is listen to me sing 
 Ooh, how I loved you (how I loved you boy) 
 Ooh, how I needed you 
 Ooh, boy I feel brand new 
 Ooh, since you turned me lose boy 
 You don't know what 
 You don't know what 
 You don't know what to do 
 You don't know what 
 You don't know what 
 You don't know what to do 
 She wanna leave (She said she wanna leave) 
 Then you never go (Then you never go) 
 I'm a set you free (I'm a set you free) 
 'Cause baby you don't know 
 You don't know what 
 You don't know what 
 You don't know what to do 
 You don't know what 
 You don't know what 
 You don't know what to do 
 I can give it to you, but what you gon' do 
 Win it, if I hit it, I bet you stuck stupid 
 A model that I got, no class in this school 
 Take your bags and go boo 
 Never mind all of the flexin' I do 
 Balenciagas, got me two steppin' on a smooth 
 Never will I lower my standards my boo 
 I could show you we're attendants like Sampras on Que 
 That's kinda funny 'cause love still mean lose 
 Unless we kill the record and back-and-forth moves 
 Somehow you keep showing you act I see through it 
 Um, did you catch it? Ah screw it 
 All the girls need is respect and I do it 
 Never catch feelings 'cause Jet's is my fuel 
 Giuseppe my foot, my sweats be D'Honneur 
 Success is sweatin' me bet you ain't know her! 
 You don't know what 
 You don't know what 
 You don't know what to do 
 You don't know what 
 You don't know what 
 You don't know what to do 
 She wanna leave (She said she wanna leave) 
 Then you never go (Then you never go) 
 I'm a set you free (I'm a set you free) 
 Baby you don't know 
 You don't know what you do to me 
 You don't know what you do to me 
 You don't know 
 You don't know 
 You don't know what you do to me 
 You don't know what you do to me 
 You don't know 
 You don't know 
 Said ou don't know 
 You don't know
