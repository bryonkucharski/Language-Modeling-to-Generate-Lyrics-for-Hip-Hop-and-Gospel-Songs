Don't hold your applause from me... 
 Inspired by women, niggas say that I treat 'em different 
 Niggas be bitches, hoes be bitches, I don't see no difference 
 Shawty my aim is different, DC my English iffy 
 Solo I be but I'm on my feet, I got these angels with me 
 Tired of making money, I'm on to making history 
 Fuck how they feel, I keeps it realer than a documentary 
 Shit I be feeling like real niggas don't make it to 50 
 And I be feeling Malcolm, Martin, and Pac would defend me 
 I focus on chicken, my Corazon frigid 
 Don't trust no cheap rubbers, don't trust no dirty bitches 
 Sippin moscato with models having exotic dishes 
 But it don't mean shit unless I know that my genre respected 
 I deserve praise, I deserve applause 
 Drawers by bad broads whenever the curtains call 
 It's all work, no days off 
 I'm on a great run, Wale Folarin 
 Make sure that they always talk of me 
 Make sure these bitches in awe for me 
 Make sure to give them my all 
 And now they know that we on 
 Don't ever hold your applause for me 
 Don't ever hold your applause for me 
 Don't ever hold your applause for me 
 Don't ever hold your applause for me 
 And ay ay ay... 
 Don't ever hold your applause for me 
 GQ man of the year, Cudi Drizzy and me 
 Went away for a little, let my wisdom increase 
 When you winning obese, all your haters fatigued 
 Got me counting my blessings, it took me Haiti to see 
 When you rapping how you rapping, bitches pack up and leave 
 When you rapping how I'm rapping, they fellatio free 
 I was pacing myself, hope you patient as me 
 Plus I got a lot, niggas ain't able to see it 
 We black niggas with ambition, they gon respect it 
 And I know I'm kinda vain, but what real nigga isn't 
 I'm tryna style on some bitches and keep it introspective 
 I'm tryna stun 'em like everybody was second guessed it 
 Wale
