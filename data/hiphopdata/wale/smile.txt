I got my family and I got my squad 
 And as long as they got me, then I'll be just fine 
 So I give God the glory 'cause I have my child 
 And America don't want me, that's when I realized 
 That we all need, yeah, a reason to smile 
 I said we all need, yeah, a reason to smile 
 Said about to be O.D.'d, yeah but we gon' survive 
 That's why we all need, yeah, a reason to smile 
 And a possible bigot slash misogynist 
 Is 'bout to run the whole damn thing 
 ('Bout to run the whole damn thing) 
 And the ballot my sister filled in 
 In another city didn't do a goddamn thing 
 Shit I'ma go crazy, yeah 
 I'ma go crazy, yeah 
 I'ma go crazy, yeah 
 But I gotta do my goddamn thing 
 The Alt Rights hate us 
 Some black baby mommas hate us 
 We only learn half of the drama, other side crazy 
 On behalf of Charlamagne, I'm sure he ain't tradin' sides 
 Maybe I should meet Tomi Lahren, I'll Lauryn Hill her 
 Train her; she miseducated anyway, yeah 
 Prolly hate the color of my face 
 I'm just a young black rappin' ass African 
 Ain't never wanted to have it and now he has it his own way 
 I'm smokin' purple, the law enforcement be murkin' brothers 
 The moon lit and I'm Cottonmouth like Mahershala 
 It's like you got a curse if your currency low 
 The world is a dirty fuckin' experiment 
 They don't care if its hurtin' us 
 Black lives matter, 'cause black lives target practice 
 Can't even imagine what would happen with no phone cameras 
 Black lives matter, black love the dopest ever 
 Just wanna remind you, I think it's time that we show it better forever 
 I got my family and I got my squad 
 And as long as they got me, then I'll be just fine 
 So I give God the glory 'cause I have my child 
 And America don't want me, that's when I realized 
 That we all need, yeah, a reason to smile 
 I said we all need, yeah, a reason to smile 
 Said about to be O.D.'d, yeah but we gon' survive 
 That's why we all need, yeah, a reason to smile 
 Giving knowledge and uplifting our brothers and daughters 
 Is how this whole thing change, yeah 
 (Is how this whole thing change) 
 But the power that's in the pussy or the dollar 
 Is enough to make us all insane 
 Shit I'ma go crazy, yeah 
 I'ma go crazy, yeah 
 I'ma go crazy, yeah 
 But I gotta do my goddamn thing 
 And I've been livin' like I got one 
 A couple hundred on me, still in the gold shotgun 
 You do the most, stop son, our people not exempt 
 They in the land of the free, you in the land of free to an extent 
 Fuck that, I'ma ruffle some feathers, mess with the temperature 
 Shuffle the weather, fuck who do ever, Keisha or Heather 
 Beef, it's whatever, kill me, you die and I live forever 
 When you live without fear, it don't get much better 
 Naw, hmm, look at how far that we've come 
 Look at the world we inspired and look at the stars that we brung 
 They think that when that literal big wig starts that we done 
 They think because Hillary lost that the cards will be Trumped 
 You out you mind, nigga 
 I got my family and I got my squad 
 And as long as they got me, then I'll be just fine 
 So I give God the glory 'cause I have my child 
 And America don't want me, that's when I realized 
 That we all need, yeah, a reason to smile 
 I said we all need, yeah, a reason to smile 
 Said about to be O.D.'d, yeah but we gon' survive 
 That's why we all need, yeah, a reason to smile
