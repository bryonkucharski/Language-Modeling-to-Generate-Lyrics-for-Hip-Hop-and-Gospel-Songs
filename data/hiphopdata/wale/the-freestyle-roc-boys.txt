I wanted several MCs to this joint 
 But I do what I must to prove I'm much 
 Better than who so ever protool'd this joint 
 The pro tool calling for those dudes love 
 Standard stanzas 
 Staying on the track like Gatlin 
 Prior to the bad quick fast to 
 Zoom like Boosie, higher than Bootsy 
 Get'em inspired with the spiral loose leaf 
 Mind like a pryo 
 I'm so Dhalsimand Guile, though gals what guides me to do me 
 I do me, I'm playing myself in this movie 
 Autobioaug' but it's brought up by y'all 
 They pressed for their ice, Oksana Baiul 
 Stunting 'round here that is not the right move 
 They don't care about me, what would they care about you? 
 Yeah, ain't really on jewels 
 Stunna I am getting silly with the shoes 
 Look at my room, ain't got no more room 
 10k on OGs, bitches need their own room 
 Your girl love me, I'm at home in her womb 
 A girl on her, bitch, get your own room 
 Give a nigga room, show you niggas my dues 
 Rique got buildings you niggas own rooms 
 Ima[?] move fresh, yeah, I know what I do 
 Ima move fresher than the first day of school 
 First day of school teacher couldn't say my name 
 Now I got the whole nation screaming "WALE" 
 Yeah, and I thank my connect 
 Not the link to it I'm thinking the internet 
 MySpace, Facebook, don't forget Map Quest 
 The MacBook Pro every time I chat 
 I mac like pro, they forgot I rap 
 While you just wrap them up like clothes in Iraq 
 To a girl in Iraq, straight G I'm that 
 And ain't never going to leave like the troops in Iraq 
 Yeah, and I'm all but the oil to em 
 Holmes do it flows hotter than a boiler room 
 Flow something like a sauna wearing corduroys 
 I am the ever fresh, you niggas quarter waters 
 Niggas on it from written house to serving quarters 
 Wale, the miracle, I'm on every corner 
 Whether like it or not, I inspire them all 
 Haters what is you saying? 
 Would you like me to stop? 
 Would you like me to not be this entirely high? 
 I inspire the pots cooking from bottom to top 
 I inspire the pot smokers to pick a new high 
 Goofy footing and kickflipping our grind is alike 
 Just minus the lifestyle, I'll fall in a lie 
 With such traction my rap is taking them all 
 Yeah, It's taking too long, I am making it hard 
 I makes a lot of sense like I paid for the malls 
 I'ont be in the mall 
 Yeah I'll be in tomorrow 
 Wife cool yeah I got it K-Kid Couture 
 Nikes shoes, 3 Gs, ain't seen in the store 
 Y'all dudes rap like you're reading The Source 
 Wale rap like he re-did The Source 
 I'm the reason the atheist can scream for the Lord 
 The second blessing, no second guessing 
 You niggas in the closet like priest at confession 
 Words touch youths like priests, I'm confessing 
 Niggas out the league like Priest when I'm rushing 
 Chiefin' on something, Ed Reed I'm running 
 Then receive and run it like I'm reverse running 
 Compress y'all paper, and reverb money 
 Ad-lib checks in the bank, holmes, no frontin' 
 And when you're this high everything is stunting 
 Although I'm this tired, don't sleep on nothing 
 And when you're this fly y'all wings don't come off 
 Think that I'd come off for soft jo c'mon 
 Saw part they jaw till their jawbone come off 
 Hold my bonds, they are Mark, I am Bonds 
 They are Ecko to Perry, I met your celebrity 
 The best of the women 'round here none carry me 
 Smart nigga brainpower this is work jo 
 I forever Pernell a nigga with my Whitaker 
 Wale overseas like my misses' purse 
 She live being coast, nigga, I ain't gotta boast 
 And I'ont need no street sweeper 'cause I be with Bo 
 And he'ont need no heat either, he from Ardmore 
 Yeah, and that's A Town down 
 Bitches see it faster than that Akon child 
 The cops move slower than the R.Kell trial 
 An architect, putting my hoods down 
 DMV bandwagon here now, like Alvin from The Program 
 We in the House-House-House 
 I'm Omar Epp'n it 
 Folarin and it don't question it 
 Work like a Mexican, original, professional 
 You're 16-bit, nigga, you are so Genesis 
 And I'm buzzing like Jena Six 
 Meanwhile young Folarin on that Todd Smith 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah I'm the house-house-house 
 Lito baby 
 Folarin
