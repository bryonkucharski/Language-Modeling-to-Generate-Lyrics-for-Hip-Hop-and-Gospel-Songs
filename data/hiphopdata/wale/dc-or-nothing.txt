In the face of adversity, I prepared a verse to see 
 Or hear rather... 
 Destined to win, get respect where I live 
 My reflection contagious, I'm the messenger here 
 Making love to the streets, they be lusting for bread 
 They ain't sleeping until they know every customer fed 
 When the city was chocolate, there was death in the air 
 All I'm hearing is aids, I ain't deaf in my ear 
 Nah I ain't deaf in my ear 
 But he push them whites in the hood like ray edmond was there 
 Shout out to Kirbo, he told me I would make it 
 Now me, Tony, G, and Tre got the keys to the nation 
 Pray for peace with the babies, they a beast in the summer 
 Of course he fiending for trouble, he had a fiend for a mother 
 Got no leaders among him, got no loyalty either 
 Once the police get to cuffing, bet his homie deceive him 
 See, it's cold where they be at, on that boat like a pirate 
 Politicians fucking hookers, why you mad at my ganja? 
 Kick him out of the city, force them whites who can pay up 
 Still different neighborhoods killing over what isn't theirs 
 Lost my nigga over nothing though 
 Saeed Alisha I miss you, god bless my brother's soul 
 I feel something change in the weather, and I'm home, home, home 
 Don't let it drift away like a feather and I'm home, home, home 
 And oh, I gotta find my way 
 Oh I gotta face the day 
 But oh I can't stay away, not never, you're my home, home, home 
 Look, I lost my nigga over nothing though 
 Saeed Alisha I miss you, god bless my brother's soul 
 Ricky is sitting, Baba was sitting 
 Caught up and slipping for fearing a McDonald's position 
 Seen it over a dollar, got him under a flower 
 Funeral drama, niggas mystery baby mamas 
 They ain't really for condoms, I just think that it's shocking 
 Got no fear in no officer, they be scared of them doctors 
 I'm aware that there's problems, know Obama gon' stop it 
 Where there's minimal conscious and there's thousands of choppers 
 I know Howard that college, but that town has some problems 
 I done seen embalming fluid ruin a nigga promise 
 Little women be mommas, little niggas ain't fathers 
 Ain't nobody here leading, it's way too easy to follow 
 They knee deep in today, ain't too fond of tomorrow 
 Although it gets you paper, I pray you weighing your options 
 This is soulful my nigga, I'm hoping I am giving a hope to my nigga 
 We just soldiers my nigga, don't know you my nigga but know you my nigga 
 This is soulful my nigga, hope that I am giving some hope to my nigga 
 We just soldiers my nigga, don't know you my nigga but know you my nigga 
 Nigga, know you my... 
 And you know my nigga 
 Know you my... 
 Look... 
 A king's assassination is why most often fear the hell 
 So needless to say this, leadership is not with a timid sail 
 I pray these words live and these gimmicks fail and 
 I pray whenever I'm seen in my city I forever resemble braille 
 May your trees be loud, and your queens be proud 
 May you see your dreams allowed, before you see them from a cloud 
 May your glass never reach half-empty, may your enemies find the inner-piece before it ever get to beef 
 I wish you, wealth, health, and pact free women for yourself and the shit ain't the best, hope these lyrics help... my nigga 
 See I made it from home, see I made it alone 
 And all these peasant motherfuckers take shots at the throne 
 Time after time, again and again 
 They wanna see a nigga lose but I'm destined to win
