Life's better when your niggas good, and your mama straight 
 I'm honestly still looking for some type of balance 
 'Cause the status got me jah tripping 
 'Cause I like my bitch, but I love these bitches on my dick 
 When spitting tell me what you feeling different knowing you's the bread winner 
 And it's rare you hear niggas say they can't feel you 
 But in your ears like he dope, just not dope enough 
 And the closest ho would be probin you to open up 
 And to do so you must roll one up 
 And it's lonely at the top 
 They say me that they feelin' me 
 I eat this game and shit this out 
 My dirty draws got winning streaks 
 I'm in too deep, this industry is sayin' to a nigga 
 Got change like them, just but ain't changed like them nigga nigga 
 The only shit on my old shit 'cause I'm on shit 
 But I was pumpin in '06 with the slow shit 
 Now my dreams is nothing more than minimal thoughts 
 Machine gon fluctuate those speakers to God 
 And I'm tired though 
 And I'm high too 
 But it's like my music made these niggas turn they pride to fool 
 Yeah, y'all don't even gotta love us 
 But you better respect this motherfucker ah, you don't know shit 
 Satisfaction's for suckers 
 Satisfaction's for suckers 
 And y'all don't even gotta love us 
 But you will respect this motherfuckin hustle, real shit 
 See life better when you know you real 
 I know some niggas is winnin' but ain't been home in years 
 Pray to not know the feeling, sitting on a couple million 
 Sipping pretentious liquids 
 Ease with they money when hella finding is on the trippin' 
 Like you were flowed I bet yourself that you worth 60 mill 
 So we keep that circle small and never let no squares in there 
 It's double M G, I hope they know the set 
 Don't you cop a second whip unless yo mama out of debt 
 Shout out to my girls in Bola, be home in a minute yep 
 My nigga's at the rivers correctional, that's me in that vent 
 They thought I wasn't winning, the crew full of troubles 
 But I do, I fucked the game and came out a gold rapper 
 I should be loving my accomplishments 
 But a brand new Maserati got me plottin on another hit 
 Success is like a neverending battle 
 Well whoever at the top and if that's you you who you tryna hear 
 The top of my last shit, it's all that I ask er 
 I pray you forgive me if I don't bask in this chapter 
 I'm a legend out Georgetown, we talkin' bout practice 
 'Cause in this establishment you ain't never established 
 Satisfaction's for suckers 
 Satisfaction's for suckers 
 And y'all don't even gotta love us 
 But you will respect this motherfuckin hustle, real shit 
 Satisfaction's for suckers 
 Satisfaction's for suckers 
 And y'all don't even gotta love us 
 But you will respect this motherfuckin hustle, real shit 
 This is the story about the price of fame 
 But the love for the dollar 
 Is because they cannot change
