I guess maybe some little problems could arise 
 (There are always a few) 
 If anything happened and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would really be bad 
 (Devastating) 
 Because this is very good 
 (And that would be good) 
 That would be good too, the idea is to combine this with that 
 Tryna keep it low 
 Keep 'em on that need to know 
 Tell everybody that we're just friends 
 But to be honest that plutonic shit's for TV shows 
 Same place, we're with different folks 
 Case closed if they crack the code 
 Is it me, or is you cold? 
 'Cause the feelings you ain't showin' pokin' out your clothes 
 Go put a sweater on or get a room 
 Forbidden fruit, swim in your juice 
 Lot of ways I can get to you 
 But my train of thought is tryna get you out your ch-ch-choo 
 Still we keep it low 
 Keep 'em on that need to know 
 'Cause somebody tell somebody 
 And somebody then sorry but somebody gon' need to go 
 I'm not tryna pressure you 
 Just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you 
 You ain't even really gotta be my boyfriend 
 I just wanna know your name 
 And maybe some time 
 We can hook up 
 We can hang out, we can just chill 
 Tryna keep it low 
 Keep 'em on that need to know 
 Tell everybody that we're just cool 
 As far as me and you, we got a simple code 
 Spendin' nights, well that's optional 
 No telephones in the afternoon 
 I know that overthinkin' only leads to subtweetin' 
 Every time your ass in the mood 
 Sharin' thoughts when we share a room 
 Though we barely talk when we share a room 
 In the dark, still see your curves 
 Body like what, swear to God you're a miracle 
 I'm not tryna pressure you 
 Just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you 
 You ain't even really gotta be my boyfriend 
 I just wanna know your name 
 And maybe some time 
 We can hook up 
 We can hang out, we can just chill 
 I mean let's say, what if we did? 
 (What if?) 
 Is that like the end of the world or something? 
 (Certainly not!) 
 Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to? 
 (I know!) 
 I mean really, what is the big deal? We go in there, we're in there for a while and then we come back out here. It's not complicated 
 (It's almost stupid if we didn't!) 
 It's moronic 
 (Absurd!) 
 I'm not tryna pressure you 
 Just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you 
 You ain't even really gotta be my boyfriend 
 I just wanna know your name 
 And maybe some time 
 We can hook up 
 We can hang out, we can just chill
