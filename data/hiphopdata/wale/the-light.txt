Uh, Rest in peace Jay Dilla 
 (Its Hip Hop) 
 Know I had to do a Jay Dilla joint 
 I never knew a luh, luh, luh a love like this 
 I put you over my money, all of my nice kicks 
 Mmm Not all of em, some still DS 
 My D & P frizest, they havent seen the streets yet 
 As I speak to the speakers I'm hopin this reach ya 
 You are the flawless creature 
 I'm in awe from all of those features 
 Regardless to all them, I appease her 
 You is a dime to them other broads peace up 
 That means two, between me and you 
 There's nothing man made than can make it just you 
 My hearts been tied, my souls been glued 
 The whole block know who I roll with too 
 Them bitches all dimes and you autobooth 
 I guarantee our change whatever we go through 
 I told you before the light imma show you... you 
 There are times when you'll need someone 
 I will be by your side 
 There is a light that shines 
 Special for you and me 
 Its important we communicate, intentions to be forever but never cannot wait 
 Never becomes prominent, all we doin' is arguin 
 Arguably retarded cause after sex we stop again 
 It's the best, I've forgotten what a condom is 
 Life's a meal a good girl is a condiment 
 I compliment you with your conversation 
 Cause any girl could look good if she concentratin 
 And personality is somethin' that you can't make up 
 Sense of humour is a tool that you can't change up 
 Look, I ain gatta tell you, you know what I'm thinkin' 
 Yeah, a nigga shallow but I'm a deep thinker 
 In life she the wife who was right in that deep end 
 Given her the TLC I'll never creep then 
 She make me Chili like T-Boz, me leave her out, I'd rather wear a pair of Filas or Reeboks 
 There are times when you'll need someone 
 I will be by your side 
 There is a light that shines 
 Special for you and me 
 It's knida fresh you listen to more than Wale 
 Nevermind I'm lyin' she bumpin me all day 
 Honey is always the one imma call late 
 Night I need that she comin' here right away 
 Night or day she need me 
 Hit it or four play 
 I'm feedin her the light just like what the chorus say 
 Hey, she give me love in abundance 
 Plus she outrun any youngin that I've hung with 
 A fun chick its nothin' to break funds with 
 I can do a whole song solely on that onion 
 My soul searchin is halted 
 I have opted to stop watchin them broads that bin plottin 
 You so got me, I'm open for life forever my wife 
 Focus let me show you the light 
 There are times when you'll need someone 
 I will be by your side 
 There is a light that shines 
 Special for you and me
