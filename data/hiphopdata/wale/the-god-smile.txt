I shine, you shine 
 We fall 
 I shine, you shine 
 We fall 
 I shine, you shine 
 We fall 
 I shine, you shine 
 We fall 
 Girls kissin' me all out, Christian Dior'd out 
 We gon' hold this city down 'til we see the whole city up 
 (Lord shine, Lord shine your light on me 
 Lord shine your light on me) 
 A1 when I'm on site, my day ones never think twice 
 Same one that get all the hate, through it all I illuminate away 
 (Lord shine, Lord shine your light on me 
 Lord shine your light on me) 
 Nah nig, nah nig 
 Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah nigga 
 Don't you doubt it if you was my nigga 
 We ain't fall out so you still my nigga 
 Don't always call you but you've been my nigga 
 You're still the same, nigga, it's just the trust 
 Nigga when you work hard 
 Used to get the outfit up off Curt Bone 
 We done came a long way from the all day store 
 And now spending 8 somethin' out Bergdoff 
 Word up, pray to God that my set good 
 Stand close to my rivals 
 Like you got a job they would kill for 
 It's all good 'cause the flow is to die for 
 My God, nigga life like a dice roll 
 And it's twice hard throwin' 'em with mics on 
 I hit 'em with the rap, everybody slept 
 Then I came back, killin' everybody's nap like a hot comb 
 At Saks 'bout to cop more 
 And cop more if they got more 
 And come back if they got more 
 Middle finger to them folks, tell 'em GABOS 
 'Cause this game ain't based on sympathy 
 Know that fame will steal your energy 
 Girls kissin' me all out, Christian Dior'd out 
 We gon' hold this city down 'til we see the whole city up 
 (Lord shine, Lord shine your light on me 
 Lord shine your light on me) 
 A1 when I'm on site, my day ones never think twice 
 Same one that get all the hate, through it all I illuminate away 
 (Lord shine, Lord shine your light on me 
 Lord shine your light on me) 
 Nah nig, nah nig 
 Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah nigga 
 Don't you doubt it if you was my nigga 
 We ain't fall out so you still my nigga 
 Don't always call you but you've been my nigga 
 You're still the same, nigga, it's just the trust 
 At 21, played running back 
 24, I had the city mad 
 Slim Charles in The Wire now 
 You could say me and him brought the city back 
 Used to hustle in hand-me-downs 
 Now I'm whippin' the Camry 'round 
 Hit licks in Baltimore 
 Gettin' Hip-Hop chicken in like Kevin Liles 
 Uptown, I learned a lot 
 Suburbs taught me good 
 The white girl destroyed the black neighborhood 
 So white boys can run the world 
 White cops is goin' to war 
 I write thoughts and put 'em in songs 
 And the devil around the corner 
 It's all good 'cause the God is livin' in you 
 Cops can look in the bag 
 Tricky to man so can you read a mind 
 And they used to go to madness, and I ain't really have it 
 Somehow they let another Eddie advance 
 Well I shine for the niggas that passed 
 So my niggas in the pen got me pushin' a pad 
 Back in the crack era, daddy whippin' a cab 
 But now I'm pushin' a camper doin' a similar route 
 One time, Junkyard meets Jay Hov 
 Marion Berry meetin' with Barry O 
 This is Lil Wayne meets Wayne Perry 
 This is bad brains from the go go 
 I'm in tears so I'm thankful 
 'Cause I got haters and I got flow 
 Niggas can't tell me nothin', I got this shit jumpin' 
 From the white house to the black hole 
 Don't let no lame tell you differently 
 Bitch I'm the savior of the DMV 
 Girls kissin' me all out, Christian Dior'd out 
 We gon' hold this city down 'til we see the whole city up 
 (Lord shine, Lord shine your light on me 
 Lord shine your light on me) 
 A1 when I'm on site, my day ones never think twice 
 Same one that get all the hate, through it all I illuminate away 
 (Lord shine, Lord shine your light on me 
 Lord shine your light on me) 
 Nah nig, nah nig 
 Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah nigga 
 Don't you doubt it if you was my nigga 
 We ain't fall out so you still my nigga 
 Don't always call you but you've been my nigga 
 You're still the same, nigga, it's just the trust
