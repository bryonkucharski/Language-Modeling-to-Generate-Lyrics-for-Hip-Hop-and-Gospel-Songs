The worst thing is when you get comfortable 
 That's why success is the enemy 
 Lord forgive us, we're sinners 
 Was poor with the other children 
 Of course the ills that are less fortunate 
 Support while they're killing 
 Graduated from school just to live on their knees 
 And wonder why the undergrads don't wait for summer for heat 
 'Cause a drug dealer's destiny's still reaching that key 
 Who are y'all to disagree 
 While everybody is looking for somethin' 
 Where the lookouts look out and be like "cuckoo, they comin'" 
 So it's nothin' when the income is nothin' 
 And the heat never be on so get that heat from the oven 
 It's humility, still humanized by these memories 
 You and I could never eye to eye 
 'Cause my style's like 5 guillotines 
 I'm more head then cutting off 5 foreheads 
 10 I seen, the tenacity of my swords edge 
 Boy... been built for that 
 Seen blood get spilt for less 
 These young bloods like a bad drug 
 Can't find a cure, take a pill back 
 Uh, rah rah, D.C. mean "don't come" 
 A "dick choke" if your ho cum 
 That was told to me by Curt Bone 
 And that's fact, shout out Wayne and Corn too 
 I ain't slang in the 80's but... I feel the pain y'all went through 
 As a hustler's "Ambition" continues 
 All them side ways niggas try and do you like Bishop 
 And I'm sorry if you 30, still purchasing nickels 
 'Cause I'm pushing 30 and the nickel be purchasing Wizards 
 Like "Ted and Zach, I got the bread, let's go and chat" 
 Man I made so much off of beanies we can go over cap 
 El Captain of the rappers songs, get at me dog 
 And I'm Christ' Dior with a crispy cuff over Paranorms 
 Stuntin', oh oh, I'm stuntin' 
 Ho-bo if there's shit in the bus scoop us a seven 
 Avenue livin', what's up 
 Revenue up the wazoo 'cause I hustle 
 Used to listen to Wasalu 
 I so was "Kick, Push"'ing the product out DTLR 
 Pardon me I'm just dwelling 
 Pursuing the exit from the cesspool we ascended 
 Uh tell me I ain't successful
