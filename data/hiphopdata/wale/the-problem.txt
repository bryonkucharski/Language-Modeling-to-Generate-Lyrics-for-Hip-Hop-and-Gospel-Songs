[Wale] (Spoken Word) 
 This isn't no griot but a mere portion of a semi-important life 
 Far from a complaint, but a mere look at the present showing you the changes that I made 
 The proverbial lemonade that I made 
 I made my mistakes, you see life's lemons often times come in a abundance 
 In conjunction with the pressure that we're under 
 Underrated some would say 
 Hated, and some say it's the things I say or how I say em 
 And I admit, in this race I tend to struggle to relate in words 
 It's like I'm an alien who alienates by the herd, so as far as being heard 
 I guess I gotta wait, deprived by the station's eye 
 Wale, more times than not, am not for whom the air waves 
 Thank God for the free thinkers, for you keep me in mind 
 In this state of mind that I'm in, for you keep me in the race with the baton that y'all give 
 And they hypebeasts, street wear, Versace and Vuitton that I'm in 
 And really don't matter unless y'all coming with 
 No days off, may we rip the face of the whole game off 
 Imma say it to y'all, I'm gonna put my faith in y'all when I don't understand me 
 They say I'm running hip-hop but I'd rather unify with y'all then stampede 
 And lastly for everybody who doubted I can't live without you, please 
 Continue to inspire the fire that is my re-dedication to greatness y'all 
 Paint A Picture to A.D. to freestyles to famous songs we out 'chere (here) 
 Unforgettable gestures, unmeasurable effort, to pleasure the masses with impeccable work ethic 
 Let's get it, I go hard, no days off 
 (Verse 1: Part 1) 
 Pain on my face, laying back rolling a J 
 Feeling like these rap niggas ain't as real as they say 
 That's why I keep my friends limited, Keep them hoes interested 
 Resented by the game like I'm Pete Rose in this bitch 
 Ain't nothing stopping us, tell you what the problem is 
 I'm on top of my game but these niggas won't acknowledge it 
 So a nigga hungry as a plastic hippopotamus 
 So, to stop us better take it in blood like a phlebotomist 
 (Seinfeld Skit) 
 You really need some help 
 But a regular psychiatrist couldn't even help you, you know what I mean? 
 You need to get involved at the university level, like where Freud studied 
 And have all those people looking at you and checking up on you 
 That's the kind of help you need, not the once-a-week for eighty bucks, no 
 You need a team, a team of psychiatrists working around the clock 
 You need to go to, like, Vienna or something 
 (Verse 1: Part 1) 
 (Verse 1: Part 2) 
 I walk around understanding the politics 
 Wish you niggas father understood where the condom was 
 '06 came, had all kind of buzz, 
 And Isaiah say one day your time will come 
 Then '09 came, them bad record sales 
 The silver-lining couldn't find 'em up on any shelf 
 I'm in the mirror like "this a product of my skills?" 
 And I feared that my fans say I failed 
 It's just my fate, let me chill, nah flip 
 My shit was submarine like, under ship 
 Look at what I'm up against, scrutiny, criticism 
 Everybody judging off a single I ain't even pick 
 Now my eyes Chinese, keep the loud lit 
 Now I'm taking these pills and I ain't even sick 
 Ice and Rain, Letter, Center of Attention 
 I wanted them on my debut, but they ain't wanna listen 
 You know I love my team, but they couldn't see my vision 
 Interscope is my fam, so I ain't tryna make no issue 
 I'm just trying to paint that picture, when I'm rhyming up in this booth 
 I'ma try to rhyme and get through, I'm documenting the truth 
 Men lie. Women lie. Numbers won't forsaken 
 The only album flop is the album niggas hate so 
 A.D. 2, on the way, let's do this 
 And God willin' niggas gonna triple up them units 
 Triple up them units, wisdom is improvin' 
 If no one's there to listen guess I'll put it in the music 
 Triple up them units, wisdom is improvin' 
 I'm heading to Vienna since y'all niggas ain't doin' shit!
