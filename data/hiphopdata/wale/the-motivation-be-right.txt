Listen, I said we gonna have a good time tonight 
 This evening I'ma take it, take it in (be right) 
 Say what, its gon (be right) 
 Say what, its gon (be right) 
 Yo Wale (be right) 
 Take them there n*gga (be right) 
 You heard knowledge is power, 
 Now you got a masters 
 To show you more massive then all them undergraduates 
 You know you so pretentious, 
 You love pretending like your love for learning 
 Could be applied to this shit 
 The line for jobs is quite high, no isn't it 
 His pride diminishes 
 His pockets gone dry from the loans it was given him 
 The world got cold overnight now didn't it? 
 Post graduation now just a spokesman 
 For unemployed blacks who ain't sadly made it 
 Every day was a Saturday, shit 
 Ain't nothing changed since the sadder day, dig 
 I know the world gets cold and the days get long 
 And the sun don't shine and you mind just wonders 
 Why me, I say it 'cause we number one 
 This why we get up in the morning 
 It's gon be all right (be right) 
 It's gon be all right (be right) 
 It's gon be all right (be right) 
 Believe that 
 It's gon be all right (be right) 
 Get away, from it all he wanted to do 
 Suicide is easy, he got nothin' to prove 
 Stuck in the pool, and its suckin him in 
 It's like a black hole, whole fucking a bis 
 Come here to picture how he bumping his fist 
 Ain't that a bloody bitch, she wasn't a bloody bitch 
 She laid, her body's gone tardy 
 Knowing you was getting by hardly 
 Knowing you can no longer party 
 Knowing you'll be followed by the bills like helotry 
 You're falling slowly 
 As you depart from your homies, earlier 
 You got a baby boy or girl in there 
 Years back you believed that the world was fair 
 But now its more declare 
 You see the world is scary 
 And now the present got you struggling 
 But use tomorrow as a mull again, church 
 I know the world gets cold and the days get long 
 And the sun don't shine and you mind just wonders 
 Why me, I say it 'cause we number one 
 This why we get up in the morning 
 It's gon be all right (be right) 
 It's gon be all right (be right) 
 It's gon be all right (be right) 
 Believe that 
 It's gon be all right (be right) 
 Old man cheat, baby girl been through it 
 And n*ggas ain't shit but you already knew that 
 Its cause of you, see, you let him do that 
 You let him a sleaze you, but money tend to do that 
 Right, now you see it on care, 
 Now you finna cut your hair, you waiting to excel 
 Looking through your phone book, couldn't get a cell 
 Rebound slow you down but you gotta excel 
 See, and now life seem hard 
 Still looking through your call log like "did he call yet?" 
 You get your girl for something tight tomorrow 
 You going to the club though, you soaking in sorrow 
 Heartbroken obviously, there's not tomorrow, 
 When the present so powerful where the hour seem longer 
 I know it hurt but life's not perfect 
 Happiness is hard sometimes you gotta work for it 
 I know the world gets cold and the days get long 
 And the sun don't shine and you mind just wonders 
 Why me, I say it 'cause we number one 
 This why we get up in the morning 
 It's gon be all right (be right) 
 It's gon be all right (be right) 
 It's gon be all right (be right) 
 Believe that 
 It's gon be all right (be right)
