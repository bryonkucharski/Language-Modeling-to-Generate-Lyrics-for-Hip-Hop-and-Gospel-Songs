They tried to make me go to rehab but I said 'no, no, no' 
 Yes I've been black but when I come back you'll know know know 
 I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine 
 He's tried to make me go to rehab but I won't go go go 
 I'd rather be at home with Ray 
 I ain't got seventy days 
 'Cause there's nothing 
 There's nothing you can teach me 
 That I can't learn from Mr Hathaway 
 I didn't get a lot in class 
 But I know it don't come in a shot glass 
 They tried to make me go to rehab but I said 'no, no, no' 
 Yes I've been black but when I come back you'll know know know 
 I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine 
 He's tried to make me go to rehab but I won't go go go 
 Wale! 
 They say I got a problem 
 This liquor keep on callin' 
 My name's Wale (Hi Wale!) 
 I'm a hiphopaholic 
 Hip Hip Anon must miss me 
 This a feinin' verse and chorus 
 Yeah I'm a bartender they tend to fork over fortunes 
 Money cannot support him 
 Shaking I hear the voices 
 I am an addict that of which I'm endorsing 
 Them twelve steps is nothing 
 How many more of them? 
 I gotta shake the habit so add me four more of them 
 Sixteen bars 
 Jack Dan of the rap song 
 Ain't nothing sweet over here - you niggas mad, dog 
 I know the arrogant love me. I'm Guinness Stoutto 'em 
 So I'mma be here - like glass foam 
 Okay! Three cheers! What the coldest of flows 
 And to those that's hating? I propose you a toast 
 I suppose you presume ready to rewind now 
 I'm good with bars why wouldn't I love that wine house? 
 Out
