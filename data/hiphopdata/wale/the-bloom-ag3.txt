Good morning, baby 
 I thank God I'm alive to greet you with the sun 
 She is but a flower, and I love her 'cause she-- 
 And we both agree this rap shit is all me 
 But the seed of this beautiful world is ours 
 My black mind, dream big and follow through even bigger 
 15 years of slavery for you lady 
 I put in work to be your nigga 
 May the sun kiss you, unconditional 
 I pray each and every lyric get to you 
 On this third rendition 
 For you and your ambition both, bloom 
 Baby, let your hair down, let it loose 
 There's no need to be scared now, 'cause I'm with you 
 And there's no judgement here, love, you are free 
 To be as wild and crazy as you wanna be 
 So baby let me see you bloom for me 
 To whom it may concern 
 Let me thank your mom for the beauty you inherited 
 Let me call her up and be like, "Excuse me Mrs. Um... 
 You don't know me, but... 
 Thank you for your flower, but I'm tryna be your sun" 
 Now wait, wait, I know what you're 'bout to say 
 Male entertainers entertain everything 
 But that ain't the case, let me put it this way: 
 If I'm tryna see you bloom, why would I do it with shade? 
 Don't play, uh, nah I won't stay long 
 The pollution that you use to I illuminate such 
 Beautiful the evolution of your bud 
 Remove your make-up I need that human nature 
 Look, me and you just ain't enough 
 We fruitful as youth let's accumulate some 
 Tell me 'bout your roots, and how you've came up 
 I call you my flower, 'cause you're my boo 
 K? Good! 
 Baby, let your hair down, let it loose 
 There's no need to be scared now, 'cause I'm with you 
 And there's no judgement here, love, you are free 
 To be as wild and crazy as you wanna be 
 So baby let me see you bloom for me 
 (Be my flower, I'll be your sun) 
 Let me see you bloom for me 
 Just let me hold you in a dark place 
 And when it's cold let me warm thee 
 I know we both come from hard times 
 'Cause I'm aroused you a rose of the concrete 
 Thorns on fleek 
 Study and I go on three, I can hit quick or chill and give you energy 
 Fresh out of college and they sweat you, now you got degrees 
 Busy to follow me I'm tryna pollinate so won't you holla when it's gotta be 
 Honey, sweet thing, let's get into it, we can do whatever 
 Be it intellect or intimate, levitate your habitat, just know who you dealin' with 
 This sort of photosynthesis don't show up with the filter in ya 
 Love, me and you just ain't enough, we fruitful as youth let's accumulate some 
 Tell me 'bout your roots, and how you've came up 
 I call you my flower, 'cause you my boo, k? good! 
 Baby, let your hair down, let it loose 
 There's no need to be scared now, 'cause I'm with you 
 And there's no judgement here, love, you are free 
 To be as wild and crazy as you wanna be 
 So baby let me see you bloom for me 
 You don't have to worry about comfort, I'm the safest place that you wanna be 
 No longer do you have to wonder, just open up and spread your wings 
 Eh oh baby, won't you (bloom bloom) 
 Eh baby, won't you (bloom, bloom, bloom, bloom) 
 Eh baby, won't you (bloom bloom) 
 Eh baby, won't you (bloom bloom) 
 Eh baby, won't you (bloom bloom)
