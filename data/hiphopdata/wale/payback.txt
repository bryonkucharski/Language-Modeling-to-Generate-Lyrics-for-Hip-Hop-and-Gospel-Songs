Mama always told me I'd be famous 
 Fame is a drug I knew that before Jay said that 
 Hate's in their blood, I see it in their eyes 
 They leave me with no choice, I leave them with no life 
 They ain't got no life 'cause they always on mine 
 I'm on these niggas mind like lice 
 Insightfully write that right so keep your parasites paralyzed 
 Anti-bacterial, the stereo is sterilized 
 Word to lethargy hardly will I ever lie 
 Don't got the head for it, don't got the bed for it 
 And therefore if I wrote it they already know it 
 It set in stone in these poems there ain't nothing bogus 
 If money talks then I'm Vic Damone (Woo!) 
 I'm Chris Tucker, fly like Snuka 
 A badass slam with a can like Smucker 
 Add me, take me, pay me it's nothing 
 I said pay me it's nothing 
 I said pay me it's nothing 
 Add me, take you baby (yeah) 
 (Pay me it's nothing) 
 (It's nothing) 
 (Pay me it's nothing) 
 Simply give me a beat, I guarantee I'll make a hater move over 
 Listen, hold up, the young dude focused 
 I'm so potent, fly, fuck if you ain't know it 
 Show me to the scoreboard, a million to the doughnut 
 Beat is my whore get get up on it like a boner 
 And I could see hits every time a nigga go in 
 Serve like the Open, word I am Federer 
 Discombobulate all my edible competitors 
 Stop meddling in grown folk BI 
 Y'all all gay at the very least b-i 
 A poor man's Pac or a very cheap BI 
 A welfare version of Wale, I see y'all 
 'Cause I insightfully rhyme, I give the sight to the blind 
 Put my plight in the verse, I bring 'em closer to mine 
 The flow no one can challenge, lyrical acrobatics 
 My entendres be tumblin' while you niggas lack balance 
 I am so much a pilot and my power unfathomable 
 To you broncos my bitches is stallions 
 Oh you mad 'cause I'm stylin' from the city of power 
 Where the weak are devoured every week, every hour 
 And it's over for powder 'cause they movin' them pills 
 On that water like islands they ain't swimmin' you dig 
 I'm just playin' the field, Ken Griffey you feel me 
 Meanin' I don't play 'cause Wale is ill 
 Wale got skills, man my nigga I'm Will Smith 
 I give 'em a script, you bitch nigga's my children 
 Pursuin' my happiness, suitable rapper here 
 If you ain't supporting it then I do it without you then 
 It's me and my nigga there until I'm a millionaire 
 The heart of a lion but I'm a Tiger Wood look in there 
 See what I'm coming with, 100 and running it 
 If you ain't subordinate then I order your punishment 
 The audience lovin' him 'cause most of them can relate 
 I lyrically elevate, they be callin' me heavensake 
 Don't stutter or hesitate, I plenish you featherweight 
 I'm stuntin' the Ferragamo, I'm running that medal pace 
 Straighter than metal face; some niggas embrace me 
 My flow is Invisalign, they can't retain me 
 Nigga I tranquilize a bucketful of crabs damn right 
 I made it out, this is for Kevin Liles, this is for L.A. Reid 
 I'm on my own now learned a little from Kenny B 
 I'm coming for everything, I'm blowin' my celery 
 Them niggas lack bars like underground when their celly ring 
 Didn't sign up for anything, I'm talking that Nelly G's 
 Need another look Catchdubs propellin' me 
 I fly em, I'm outta reachcause denim is everything 
 Indeed, the flow raw just the same as my Levi jeans 
 Fuck it, they shrink to fit 
 Beastin' up in my Tiffs 
 Yeah they hyped out but the bitches be lovin' it 
 Fuck this shit 
 And I bit Jay-Z 
 What more can I say?! (hahaha)
