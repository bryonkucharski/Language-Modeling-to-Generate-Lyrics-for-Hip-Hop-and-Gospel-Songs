Do you think I'm crazy 
 Do you think I'm out of my mind with this tape 
 Rap is out of shape, so I just wanna taper 
 And then give it a shape up 
 My flow is a razor's edge Chico 
 How can I convey this 
 How can I portray this 
 How can I relate this image with the same list of lyrics so I changed up 
 From fear of the same stuff, I give them the tailor 
 Made from the brain of me, most genius 
 Always I appreciate it, when they leave us 
 No one give a damn when they breathe in the least bit 
 When they try to teach us, we be in the bleachers 
 When they are deceased every player turn blue-chip 
 Same thing with this music 
 Those who've grown immune to it make they own taste to produce it 
 Either in the visual, lyrical or audio 
 Clothing line struggle till the proper nigga on it 
 But who on it first usually gets laughed at and sassed 
 And they say I'm over heads 'cause they don't understand... that 
 Do you think I'm crazy, crazy, crazy 
 Do you think I'm crazy, crazy, crazy 
 I swear they think I'm crazy 
 Too much percussion and bass when I take beats 
 God gave me wisdom and you disbelievers atheists 
 While I'm making history 
 Like I drew attemtped, curriculum, get me 
 Ain't he, ancient like the pharaoh 
 Lil' more dinero 
 Denim front been still kickin' ten zero 
 Yeah, I am crazy, hoppin' off the wall like Vega 
 They vaguely decipher my language 
 Outta my mind, come and chase me 
 Rich off of Grammer like I'm managing Frasier, Cheers 
 Psycho, maestro, orchestrate the life with the right flow 
 Right flows down and they might go nice 
 A low life's plight 
 I give up my light like an interracial couple wit a child 
 I'm fuckin' paramount, I hope they understand that 
 Light over heads mean I'm right where they head is 
 Pause, epiphany 
 Y'all, ironically, normal, and Nermal, from Garfield, you're kitten me 
 Do you think I'm crazy 
 Do you think I'm crazy 
 It's obvious I'm crazy 
 Besides Black Thought, Ye and Jay-Z 
 Told you Camp Lo was my favorite 
 They was on that Mase shit 
 I was on my sway shit 
 How can I persuade more heads to hear this great shit 
 I just stop trying to 
 Had to get my mind on what I do 
 They would not oblige to a mind who inclined or flying over climbers 
 Gliding through the skies as the slow minds wander 
 Walking on the ground 
 An iPod mind to you Walkman guys 
 But I apologize for not walking you around 
 'Cause I acknowledge I am far more knowledge 
 They are more garbage and I am so Nasir 
 Yeah, and I ain't saying that I'm Nas here 
 I'm just saying rap's dead when I'm not here 
 Bring it back, I ain't saying that I'm Nas here 
 I'm just saying rap's dead when I'm not here
