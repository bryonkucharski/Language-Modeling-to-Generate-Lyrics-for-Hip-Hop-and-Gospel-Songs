Come and talk to me, I'm serious, yeah 
 Come and talk to me, I'm curious, yeah 
 Money I can bring but I'm serious, yeah 
 Shawty, I can bring you somethin' different, look 
 Good dick and advice, I'm 'bout it 
 Good dick and advice, I got you 
 If you need it in your life, I got that 
 I might put it in your life, you won't go back, go back 
 Come and talk to me, I'm serious, yeah 
 Come and talk to me, I'm curious, yeah 
 Money I can bring but I'm serious, yeah 
 Shawty, I can bring you somethin' different, look 
 Good dick and advice, I'm 'bout it 
 Good dick and advice, I got you 
 If you need it in your life, I got that 
 I might put it in your life, you won't go back, go back 
 What would you do if I told you my need to know you 
 Was as sweet as no one's? 
 What if a brother was ill enough to kill your fears and lovin' 
 In the convos he brung you was as deep as the condolences from a loved one, I wonder? 
 What if I told you, I just wanna hold you, until 
 I know you, And I'd rather know you before we go do what grown ups do, closed room 
 Post honeymoon, would you 
 Run away or run up to? 
 If I gave you the right of way 
 Would you give it up right away like that last scribble with that number two? 
 Shoot, let's have a, sip from my affection 
 And expound on this new found friendship as we share and reciprocate wisdom 
 Only difference with my particular curriculum is 
 I'm here to lecture and listen, shawty, get it together 
 So you can take this as the takin' me, takin' my charm 
 Or take me by the hand or rather arm, and hold me tighter than a hope 
 Of this potential bond can be if you honestly ponderin', callin' on me 
 See right now, the only thing between us makin' universe smile 
 Is what you want me to call you 10 hours after you give me them 10 numbers to dial, and if 
 It's any consolation, I feel some type of havin' some type of honour 
 In havin' a conversion with a number 10 right now 
 I see you later and see if you like it 
 See you later, see if you love it 
 See you later, you can see some effort 
 I see you later, so, so much, you wanna see me forever 
 That's all the advice I got 
 Good dick and advice, I'm 'bout it 
 Good dick and advice, I got you 
 If you need it in your life, I got that 
 I might put it in your life, you won't go back, go back 
 Come and talk to me, I'm serious, yeah 
 Come and talk to me, I'm curious, yeah 
 Money I can bring but I'm serious, yeah 
 Shawty, I can bring you somethin' different, look 
 Listen to me, good dick and advise, I got that 
 Good dick and advice, I'm 'bout it
