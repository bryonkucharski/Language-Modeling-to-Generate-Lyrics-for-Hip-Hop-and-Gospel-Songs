This is not Tha Drought 3 
 This is not a Kanye mixtape 
 This is not a 50 mixtape 
 This is something different 
 You know what I'm saying 
 If you love hiphop music and you love Wale 
 Then, prepare to have the eargasm of a lifetime 
 100 Miles and Running, Wale, catch dubs 
 Let's do it 
 Come get some, you little bum 
 I bake the cake but you can't get a crumb 
 I made the pop rock that guy on 
 Shanghai Dunks with the Hyvent on 
 I've been fly, I could pilot y'all 
 Pride of Columbia, I've got that y'all 
 I'm is that kid 'cause I spit that piff 
 Whips ain't shit but my kicks look sick 
 I don't wear jewels, too much conflict 
 Get loose like a Jew when I do rhyming 
 And I'm at, I'm on their mind like a yamaka 
 Supreme for my team or Orlean all prided up 
 Got problems, what? I can't save ya 
 Can't wear GRs, I'm pitching cocaine 
 I ain't even start yet, this is propane 
 Get the heat ready then I give them that flame 
 There's crack, there's crack 
 There's crack, there's crack 
 There's crack, there's crack 
 There's crack nigga, there's crack 
 They warming up cane, they warming up cane 
 They warming up cane, they warming up cane 
 They warming up cane, they warming up cane 
 They warming up cane, they warming up cane 
 Since cane been brought up, the cane been bought up 
 Cane been warmed up and sent to the corner 
 Every since then our whole city been horrible 
 The hard, fast dope has a whole lot of coroners 
 Whole lot of cobras with dope like soap bars 
 For the most part those blocks get Bogart 
 Hoes pop from the Corda to Hope Park 
 Fed ain't dumb but they sittin' in the cold dark 
 I start to think it's all planned 
 It's all too black for me to blame it on the man 
 I just blame it on a man named Reagan 
 Face it: your face Caucasian, you literally naked 
 Physically straight but they cake they behavior 
 I ain't trying to bitch, but they say that I'm hating 
 Your wrists don't glist, get the pots out baby 
 You trying to get paid, then you better get to baking 
 There's crack, there's crack 
 There's crack, there's crack 
 There's crack, there's crack 
 There's crack nigga, there's crack 
 They warming up cane, they warming up cane 
 They warming up cane, they warming up cane 
 They warming up cane, they warming up cane 
 They warming up cane, they warming up cane 
 It's odd that they say that the crack kill blacks 
 The crackerjacks say that the blacks kill blacks 
 The blacks kill blacks for a crack of respect 
 Or the crack that they sell to put food in their kids 
 Shoot my ping and if you gonna listen 
 The government officials is rude in the District 
 They do the shipment, we do the pitching 
 They do the score and we more like Pippen 
 They locking us up for the drugs that we dealing 
 But I don't know no hood nigga that's a chemist 
 All we do is work white, sorta like a dentist 
 Cook that bag then buy a couple tennises 
 Supply it to the fiends that believe when it's in them that they better, 
 But they never gonna be till they finished 
 Finished mean done, and done mean dead 
 DC's here, this is where crack lives 
 There's crack, there's crack 
 There's crack, there's crack 
 There's crack, there's crack 
 There's crack nigga, there's crack 
 They warming up cane, they warming up cane 
 They warming up cane, they warming up cane 
 They warming up cane, they warming up cane 
 They warming up cane, they warming up cane
