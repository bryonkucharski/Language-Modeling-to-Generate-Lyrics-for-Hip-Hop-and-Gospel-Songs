(Intro: Wale) 
 It's important to go right into the booth after the arguing 
 I think it's only right, hoarse and everything 
 Like fuck it though, what's up 
 (Verse 1: Wale) 
 Pessimism is all that she know 
 Cause every brother she go with always pick up and go 
 I been trying to show you somethin', got a different approach 
 Told her, "Give me your heart; try to get you the globe" 
 Have the world baby girl, live it up, you deserve it 
 Every time she catch feelings she go throw away the gloves 
 We go together / break up 
 We go together / break up 
 Ain't this an insecure bitch, meanin' we love to make up 
 When we good, we good shawty 
 We don't ever make love 
 But if I call out your name, I bet your ready to "uh!" 
 You say you ready, you ain't ready enough 
 'Cause when it fall right in your lap, you be ready to get up 
 This is her, this is it, this is sabotage love, counterfeit 
 She the shit, She the one 
 She got cold feet, my love will be the sun, get it done 
 This is her, this is it, this is sabotage love, counterfeit 
 She the shit, She the one 
 She got cold feet, my love will be the sun, get it done 
 (Bridge: Lloyd) 
 'Cause I, am feeling this deepdown in my heart 
 I'm feeling like I never want to be apart 
 But just when it gets good, she's gone 
 And I'm left right back at start... 
 (Hook: Lloyd) 
 My girl likes to sabotage, our love yeah 
 She can only take so much more than her heart got 
 She can only live for the moment 
 Why? I'll never know it 
 Guess I'll meet her right back at start 
 (Verse 2: Wale) 
 Let's roll a J and pretend we in love 
 I've got a paper plane, it's propelling my buzz 
 I'm trying to make a way, she never call back 
 She's tryna fall back, 'cause she say I'm all that 
 She only love me when I be ignoring 
 When I be doing throwin' it on her, shorty brushing me off 
 I swear, I kinda feel like she's slightly bizarre 
 Sabotage all the time, have me Avatar'd 
 Blue ball, who fault? Mine, only 'cause I stickaround 
 She leave before the sun up, leave you something to think about 
 Yeah and this is something to think about 
 Why people want you single every time that you got a spouse 
 Ha, that make it hard to be faithful 
 Knowing I can go wherever and get 8 more 
 10 more depending on where Wale going 
 Fuck it I got a few more now that my hair long 
 It's weird shawty, your wares showing me dead wrong 
 You gon' miss a good thing and bitter alone 
 Shit ain't better alone 
 I get her once I bet you keep coming back for more 
 Keep coming back for more, 
 Keep coming back for more 
 Keep coming back for more, 
 Keep coming back for... 
 (Verse 3: Wale) 
 This is her, this is it 
 This is sabotage love, counterfeit 
 She the shit, She the one 
 She need now, 
 She ain't never needed love 
 Gotta go, let her leave 
 This is something that could never ever be 
 Said her hearts, in a cage 
 'Cause if you never love, you can never hate 
 Marinate 
 (Bridge: Lloyd) 
 Sabotage, sabotage, I love you 
 Sabotage, sabotage, I love you 
 Sabotage, I love how you keep coming back for more 
 (Why do you, Why do you, Why do you, Why do you, Why do you) 
 Keep coming back for more 
 (Why do you, Why do you, Why do you, Why do you...) 
 Keep coming back for more 
 (Outro: Wale) 
 Another sabotage 
 Another sabotage 
 ...For more 
 Keep coming back for more, 
 Keep coming back for... 
 The thing's like crack for sure 
 I keep coming back for more 
 Gimme some motherfuckin coughdrops. Ha.
