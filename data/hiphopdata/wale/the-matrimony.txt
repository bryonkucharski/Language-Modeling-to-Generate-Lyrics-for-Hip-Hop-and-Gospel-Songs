If there's a question of my heart, you've got it 
 It don't belong to anyone but you 
 If there's a question of my love, you've got it 
 Baby don't worry, I've got plans for you 
 Baby, I've been making plans, oh love 
 Baby, I've been making plans 
 Baby, I've been making plans 
 Baby, I've been making plans for you 
 My sincerest apologies, I mean it 
 I'll admit it, all being pathetic 
 I'm in my late 20s still never been to a wedding 
 Guess the idea of that lobby empty do not sit with me well 
 It's not your fault they try to get me, 'cause I'ma need to sail 
 'Cause I'm selfish and I need you to myself 
 Tryna see you afloat but don't wanna see you on sale 
 'Cause I failed and see you bout to cry 
 'Cause when I enter they city they leave without they pride 
 And I'm sorry, and you starin' at my comments 
 Fearin' it's gone always be you sharin' me with all them 
 Wrong, how dare I say ignore them 
 Preparing for that day, I leave you here and switch you for them 
 It's hard, you know temptation and all 
 Out here tryna see if my relationship's strong 
 Get a place in the charts or runaway from your heart 
 Gave this music my all, nothing is sacred no more 
 I'm wrong 
 But I'm promisin' you better though 
 And your friends sayin' let him go 
 And we ain't gettin' any younger 
 I can give up now but I can promise you forever though 
 If there's a question of my heart, you've got it 
 It don't belong to anyone but you 
 If there's a question of my love, you've got it 
 Baby don't worry, I've got plans for you 
 Baby, I've been making plans, oh love 
 Baby, I've been making plans 
 Baby, I've been making plans 
 Baby, I've been making plans for you 
 I'll admit it, let me be hypothetic 
 The day I find a women I prolly be scared to share it 
 The idea of me finding love would run somebody off 
 And true my wall could use some plaques but still I got the floors 
 Brush you off, see I'm kinda lost 
 Now I'm up in the club with a couple of Move On's 
 And dark, troubled heart 
 Went from fallin' in love to drunk and fallin' apart 
 This is hard, tryna find some time to move on 
 'Cause when we lost our baby, I got shady she got too dark 
 Soft, and I thank you baby, you strong 
 My ex before you married to, you solo I say so long 
 Nah, good terms how that ended 
 But it surely put a dent in how I worry about this business 
 Off white picket fences, more flights with the children 
 On site stealin' kisses on off nights my intentions 
 But, I plan to do it better though 
 But you still sayin' let it go 
 We ain't gettin' any younger 
 Women love me now but in your eyes we forever though 
 If there's a question of my heart, you've got it 
 It don't belong to anyone but you 
 If there's a question of my love, you've got it 
 Baby don't worry, I've got plans for you 
 Baby, I've been making plans, oh love 
 Baby, I've been making plans 
 Baby, I've been making plans 
 Baby, I've been making plans for you
