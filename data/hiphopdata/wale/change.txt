I saw a dried up river and a rich man 
 Turning on a garden hose 
 I see a young man picking up a gun 
 I guess that's where the money goes, yeah 
 Am I just as good as a bad man 
 Sleeping while the rest are dying? 
 Or am I just as bad as a good man 
 Saying there's no use of trying? 
 Ooh, tell me do you still believe 
 Ooh, everything that you read? 
 Till we learn to get together 
 And see who we really are 
 Ain't nothing gonna change 
 Ain't nothing gonna change 
 If nobody's gonna wake up 
 And start asking who's in charge 
 Ain't nothing gonna change 
 Ain't nothing gonna change 
 Ain't nothing gonna change 
 Ain't shit changing but diapers on babies 
 Get higher than the background singers singing, singing 
 Okay singing 
 Some people do it all for money 
 And some do it all for their love, yeah 
 Some do it all for the glory 
 'Cause nothing else they're thinking of 
 I saw a man in a four door truck 
 Complaining that the price is high 
 Like a well feed man with a spoon in his hand 
 Saying who ate all the apple pie, yeah 
 Ooh, tell me do you still believe 
 Ooh, everything that you read? 
 Till we learn to get together 
 And see who we really are 
 Ain't nothing gonna change 
 Ain't nothing gonna change 
 If nobody's gonna wake up 
 And start asking who's in charge 
 Ain't nothing gonna change 
 Ain't nothing gonna change 
 Ain't nothing gonna change 
 If I ain't ready to listen I'm never gonna listen 
 Most follow intuition while they wishing it would work 
 And my vision isn't perfect so I will never look for it 
 Don't wish for some change like a church worker 
 Hallelujah, preacher I am not influenced 
 If I don't donate to your movement am I not improving? 
 And while the poor kill the poor for a portion 
 A piece of American society pie 
 I get high, the munchies I got so bear witness 
 I got this girl looking at you 'cause my reps kissing 
 And I ain't ready to wait when there's dollars on the brain 
 Why would you expect change? 
 Till we learn to get together 
 And see who we really are 
 Ain't nothing gonna change 
 Ain't nothing gonna change 
 If nobody's gonna wake up 
 And start asking who's in charge 
 Ain't nothing gonna change 
 Ain't nothing gonna change 
 Ain't nothing gonna change, no, no 
 Ain't shit changing but diapers on babies 
 Get higher than the background singers singing, singing
