 But I'm buyin' ice to let all of these niggas chill 
 Never ever gotta write a will 
 Niggas won't beat me like Emmett Till

 You know I'm a loner, loner, loner, loner 
 Smokin' that dope, only Cali could grow it 
 Doin' my shows, all the bitches gon' bump us 
 Show off my card, there's livin' with no limit 
 I could buy a house and a Benz in the mornin'
