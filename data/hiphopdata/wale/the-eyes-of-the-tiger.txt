Thinkin' wit my dick, My head in the clouds 
 Should of avoided my temptation instead of my vows 
 Now I may suffer my forever shit wit Elin 
 Let's put this shit to bed before this message gets the L-O 
 And if she catch me slippin', 
 The media gon' trip, And I got shit to do on TV, keep me clean don't be no snitchin 
 And I'ma hold you down forever and appreciate the effort 
 And ya pussy was amazing but it ain't worth a couple million 
 C'mon girl 
 Don't be wrong girl 
 I hope you not rattin' out to get on girl 
 See my whole life I been winnin' 
 So the right to have these women, I'm entitled to their interest 
 Yeah I'm at 'em 
 And this a vicious battle that I'm havin' 
 But an addict yes I am, but I should act more like an adult 
 It knows me 
 It controls me 
 And I'm still hurtin' over pops, 
 It consoles me 
 Okay my stories ain't addin' up 
 But Elin don't got no proof 
 And hell if I'm gon tell him, now shut up and play it cool 
 I love what the ladies do 
 But I love my babies too 
 And I have forsaken my marriage, now she gon take me for loot 
 Look in the mirror, 
 What do I really need 
 Is it the money or my marriage or media peace 
 Life's fuckin' wit me, 
 Once the message released, 
 She found out and tried to treat my head like a tee 
 Bitch! 
 (Sinfield Skit) 
 Shit 
 Embarrassments an understatement 
 As I annihilate the very thing that once was sacred 
 See my desire for the lust, fucked up what was love 
 Street fighter hope she had that Tiger upper cut 
 Now they comin' out the woodworks snitchin' on me 
 Once Mr. Woods was all good, Now a nigga only 
 You see now that nigga lonely 
 And losin all his money 
 Still hear that laughin' under breath by the Orlando police 
 See that's insult to injury 
 Now I'm losin everything as they began the lynch in me 
 Turnin' on ESPN you see they got it in for me 
 And they won't stop until they got my legacy in infamy 
 Infamy can't deal wit it 
 She gon get the meals for this 
 Don't root for me 
 They boo for me 
 And cheer for Phillip Nickleson 
 VJ Sing and all of them 
 They gon stop acknowledging 
 Have they all forgot who made this golf shit hot again 
 Shit, How quickly they turn on a nigga 
 Yet, it is forever in a day to forgive and forget one 
 I'm forever a nigga 
 Guess when I knew the verdict, 
 I thought of Bill Clinton 
 I looked at Roethlisbergerjavascript:void (0); 
 At the politics surface, I ain't hardly workin' 
 I'm gettin' help for this addiction, now golf ain't important 
 But I'm sorry for the damage I have done 
 For all the pedicures I've given to their camel toes they bring 
 I know I'm wrong now 
 Can we get along now? 
 Would I stay with her, or separate or move along now 
 Okay you wrong now 
 We don't get along now 
 Three quarter bills later, 
 Maybe guess you get it all now
