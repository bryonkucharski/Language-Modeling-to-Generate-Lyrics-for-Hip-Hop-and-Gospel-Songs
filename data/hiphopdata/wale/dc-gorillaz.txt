I'm a gorilla 
 I spit till the void fill up 
 'Cause honestly I feel the radio is staright filler 
 If North is up and South is down 
 Why every five minutes niggas walking out 
 That's not a jab at UNK but I don't think the PD's are reasoning with us 
 'Cause they don't think, no 
 They just wanna dance 
 And she don't want to learn 
 She gon' shake that little ass while they rain with that cash 
 If I don't make that man there dance 
 That man there throw Wale on the shelf and I lose 
 I'm not moving like a cartoon 
 Or a harpoon to Tom Cruise with a jock tune 
 For every Black Thought, I thought I caught Roots 
 It don't feel right, so what I'm gonna do 
 It's lopsided like a AA college student trying to undertake a D1 scholar 
 They need work, the freaks here makes their knees work 
 Yep she's on X, I called that bitch speed burst 
 I plead with em, the system ain't right 
 Like the first Nintendo, the blinking red light 
 So my thought process is all but a cartlidge 
 When I'm blown I can work proper 
 Yeah listen up, I ain't here kissing up 
 Every single single ain't a single just to hit the clubs 
 I am not involved, nor do I indulge in the hardest thing of poor artistry 
 I rock awesomley, the offspring of the flawless brings game 
 I'm autumn leaves change 
 Photosynthesis, notice what the focus is 
 I move the club like a poker dealer 
 And most feel me like masseuse 
 Lyrical kama sutra 
 But radio ain't trying to follow suit 
 So what you've heard is the fix like super 
 Intendent attend them, cool 'cause 
 It's cool 'cause the radio don't do much 
 I lead the city in requests, but don't do nothing 
 Them dudes fronting like grills 
 Fronting like Pharrell 
 They take a loss man 
 I'm all about the bills 
 And I'm about to fill y'all in on the real 
 No BDS, no deal 
 Y'all don't wanna tango with me 
 I'm dangling with E's and a straight Dave Blaine from the scene 
 PFKT with the lane's on the feet, you ain't know a rap nigga like me 
 Reggie Miller Nike's 
 I do the right thing 
 Although I missed out on them white Spike Lee's 
 I lack jungle fever, had to black for the sneakers 
 Had to get my utmost feeted sleep 'cause 
 They getting deals with their weak buzz 
 Fuck it, Wale still kicking like FIFA 
 So keep fronting till my peeps come 
 Relief pitchers put the heat to em 
 Blackberry and T phone 
 Slam X high piece on it 
 Damn right, them my peeps sung it 
 I'm getting cheese like my teeth touching and cheeks puffy 
 I keep it coming nigga, I'm a beast youngin' 
 I kick the door like police warrants 
 All day, Wale, D.C 
 Gone
