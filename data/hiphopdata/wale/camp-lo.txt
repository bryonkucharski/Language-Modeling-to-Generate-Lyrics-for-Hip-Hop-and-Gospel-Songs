(Get that Glow) 
 Yeah, Yeah, Hip Hop forever 
 202, 301 
 Doors open we stepping out 
 The illest they yell about it 
 The city wasn't cursed I be working with Kevin Liles 
 Now, I remain unnoticed, with Jimmy I'm Interscope'ing 
 But it's like I'm on some cloak shit 
 Now I'm loaking like O and them, so I be showing off my tape 
 Got the whole hood focusing 
 I make music like Caine, see a cheap death but they get it in the end, aim 
 Fire, line after line, you better get that boy off that big wheel child 
 Everybody get it like a synonym line 
 AOL virus can't produce a sicker I'm 
 Get it, IM, AIM nigga ain't playing 
 You can be a Hummer I'm a fucking A-Train 
 Um, H&M yeah I know that shit cheap jo' 
 But I'm just looking for a peacoat see jo' 
 And Lyor I'm the hottest in the east coast 
 Sneakerhead, back packer, most important these whores 
 No lying all foes must detour 
 Yeah they rhyme but they ass like Eeyore 
 I bare with me like Winnie 
 The money like honey, I'm always gon' get it 
 I ride around the city as I watch for the Piglet 
 And when it get hot I bounce like Tigger, nigga 
 Yeah, the Camp Lo of today, I learned my game in 90's 
 But I'm so in the 80's, baby I am just that vintage 
 This is Hip-hop on that Popeye spinach 
 Pimp type image when my pen get in it 
 Put tracks on track, make a limerick trick 
 Yeah, and have my money in the morning 
 Before I get that armor have that comma in a coma 
 No sir, don't test the patience 
 I will execute any exclamation 
 Handle that stanza, man oh man, what and they would not like 
 Cause the metaphor in ransom, Wale hip-hop black panther 
 Free lunch programmer when challenged I am more slam 
 Than the rest of them, fly when I encompass 
 Peep my direction, yes, am jive throwed, so he leaning 
 Always got a bottle like a genie, thousand dollar sneakers 
 100 Miles Running through your speakers 
 Whole time I Camp Lo I'm looking for Luchini 
 Introducing phantom of the whole whatever you call it 
 I'm better than all of 'em, leave 'em in awe incredible artist 
 A fucking scholar who never did college 
 I just opted to dodge out and get my chips I'm Erik Estrada 
 I'm in a cardigan lapel, I'm freaking it proper 
 Wale Folarin, swear my product should be up in Prada 
 Or even Gucci, in a movie you living a lie 
 I call my Goonies they pursue you, you live where you lie 
 And those my height still will never be level to I 
 In plain English, Wale lyrically inclined 
 They climax when I rap, orgasmic, organic speakers and the ashes 
 They cannot win without the rap Steve Nash 
 Yeah, it's sad but it's true but they Udonis Haslem 
 And what you've done is had this Shaq of an MC 
 Just be here while they get killed 
 So hip-hop but D.C. still 
 OG of Goadomes leave them D.C's chill 
 Hypebeast nigga are the people they feel 
 Niggas like Beckham they ain't playing for the Real 
 I'm Madrid, consistently, persistently make alot of noise 
 And I fill a void of the industry 
 I'm praying for my enemies, they don't know now better 
 Aye Guru, tell Blaze that I just need that Polo sweater 
 And I don't need a beat now, wait until they sign me 
 When my budget there I will be dialing 
 Name Wale my big brother Wall-E 
 PG or D.C. this is where you'll find me 
 You won't find peace on this side 
 Like Larry in Commonwealth 'round here we bring them Clipse out 
 I cover you son, I flow with an eclipse mouth 
 So Catchdubs bring the mix out 
 Out
