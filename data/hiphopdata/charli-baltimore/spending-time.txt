Christina Millian 
 Chuck B. Moore, Murder Inc. 
 See'mon! 
 (Chorus: Christina Milian) 
 Spending time with you (yeah yeah yeah) 
 Makes me feel real good (uh uh uh) 
 All my days with you 
 Makes me say ooh - ooh ooh (yeah yeah yeah) 
 (Verse: Christina Milian) 
 Darling when I look at you 
 It always makes me feel real good 
 And I know I kind of fell for you 
 Like I never thought I would (never thought I would) 
 And baby when I think of you 
 It always brightens up my smile (my smile) 
 So won't you come on over boy and just stay with me for a while 
 I love when I'm... 
 (Verse: Christina Milian) 
 And baby when I'm feeling down 
 It's always you that makes me right 
 It seems like you're the only one that can satisfy my appetite 
 And even when its pouring rain 
 I can't wait to see your face (see your face) 
 Because you bring my sunshine back and you just can't be replaced 
 I love when I'm... 
 (Verse: Charlie Baltimore) 
 Now listen 
 If I spend my days with you 
 Is timing for me or are you geniuz? 
 'Cause I spend my nights with you 
 Only if you my man and not a one night stand 
 I got plans on loving you 
 I follow your lead cause you all I need 
 So easy, with that thug in you 
 Take it slow we gon' pace the flow 
 I know you're thinking devilish 
 Cause the girl roll 1-8-7ish (Murda!) 
 Get it back, my lifestyle not my wife style 
 Boy, I only hold mics on the TV 
 Hold hands when you need me, believe me 
 See be always on guard 
 But timing makes me love her, yeah 
 So put your ex's in check 
 They exit, I'm next, accept it 
 My time in minds inperfected, Chuck! 
 (Bridge: Christina Milian) 
 Everyday and every night 
 I can't wait to have you by my side (have you by my side) 
 Have you by my side (have you by my side) 
 Everyday and every night 
 I can't wait to have you by my side (have you by my side) 
 Have you by my side
