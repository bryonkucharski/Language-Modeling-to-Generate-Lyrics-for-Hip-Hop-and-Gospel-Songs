 (Charli Baltimore) 
 Man you heard of us, murderers 
 Mommies, catz observin us 
 S sellin, 430 convertibles 
 Find me, throwin' the M's at my mens 
 And tims, mitcheness, it's hard to impress this 
 My ball, rock T's over them vest's 
 Thuggin' when he mashin the ghetto princess and 
 No question, bag me, baby daddy, future, recruit ya 
 Any bitch will suit ya, Chuck 
 (Ashanti) 
 I found something that could bring me joy 
 And I, keep him right here next to me 
 My heart, finally got a chance to see 
 How good lovin' can set me free 
 (Chorus: Ashanti) 
 All my life, I've been, searchin, for you 
 Everyday, so glad, that I, found you 
 All my life, I've been, killin', for ya 
 Everyday, I'm so happy, baby 
 (Ashanti) 
 Boy you, know just how to make me smile 
 There's no, other place I'd rather be 
 I'm so, glad that you came around 
 And I, know you know you let me out 
 Your on my mind, baby 
 I'm so in love, with ya baby 
 Your so on my mind, baby 
 I feel alive, with ya baby 
 (Chorus: Ashanti) 
 All my life, I've been, searchin, for you 
 Everyday, so glad, that I, found you 
 All my life, I've been, killin', for ya 
 Everyday, I'm so happy, baby 
 (D.O. Cannons) 
 How you ride man? I ride on them days and dubs 
 What the deal? 'Cause these drugs got me feelin' the buzz 
 And you know, when I'm up in the club, I'm poppin' the bub 
 Ain't no second frontin for nothin' we gettin' it up 
 And it's all love for niggaz that got love for I-N-C 
 Bossed up in the club, playa ya eyes on me 
 I be up in the drop-top down, sunk in the seat 
 Hollerin like "Shorty!" 
 We holler like "Whoa!" 
 Why don't you ride wit us 
 It ain't nothin' but a G thing that's what's up 
 We gettin' it crunk, and the bars on us 
 I got like twelve bottles I swipe the thieves up 
 And ya you can't stand it, Chuck the red bandit 
 Young Merc and D.O. you know it's murder fo-sho' (Yeah) 
 We throwin' a party tonight 
 Make sure the boss there we feelin' happy tonight 
 You know 
 (Ashanti) 
 All my life, oh said I've been searchin 
 Everyday, so glad, so glad, that I, found you 
 All my life, 'cause I've been feindin for you 
 Everyday, and I'm so happy, baby, ya 
 Boy you know you know you knock me out 
 So I standin baby 
 Boooy you knock me out
