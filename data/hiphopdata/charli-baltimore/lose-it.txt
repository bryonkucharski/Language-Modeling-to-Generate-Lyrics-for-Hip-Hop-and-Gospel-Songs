Uh huh, yeah, yeah 
 Uh huh, yeah, Storch 
 Uh, uh huh, yeah 
 Boo yah, you hit the lotto 
 'Cause Chuck had a bottle 
 And I'm feelin' tight woozy 
 Feelin' like Jacuzzi 
 Soak and you smokin' 
 Cali Kush and chokin' 
 My pink nipples pokin' 
 You ready to stroke it? 
 Jokin', ain't sweet to bag it 
 Resume got to be spotless 
 For you to tag it 
 I'm a handful like fat ass 
 When you grab it 
 Take a stab 
 Cold turkey in my attic (tell me) 
 Ever had a bitch like me? 
 You ain't never had a chick like C 
 All struck, tossed up 
 'Bout the way I flow 
 But so low, that's the way I roll 
 So let's go, but uh 
 Hold up, wait a minute who he? 
 Gangsta, gangsta, sure enough, ooh eeeh 
 Come ride if you come my way 
 'Cause all night is the way I play (ok) 
 Now what you sayin' again? 
 Tell me what it's hittin' for 
 You only got 4 minutes like 
 I'm 'bout to spit it 
 Doin' 5, I hit the door (whoa) 
 Don't talk just do it 
 Don't beat around the bush get to it 
 Hope you got your wing up 
 Better drink a Redbull 
 In a minute I'm a make you lose it 
 You lose it, you lose it 
 CB goin' make you lose it 
 I got my low cut jeans 
 You can see my G-String 
 Guaranteed I'm a make you lose it 
 Listen, I ain't startin' nothin' 
 I ain't finishin' 
 Pressed to get me in horizontal position 
 And comin' at me sideways 
 I ain't listenin' 
 You let the fuck up 
 Boy I'm nitro glycerine 
 Firestarter, if you right I go harder 
 My guard up, your jaw up 
 Runnin' your black carter 
 Shake 'em up, explode 
 Like chic soda, it's 
 Coca-cola keep blowin' my Motorola 
 Told ya I need a soldier 
 Think you in love with a stripper 
 Like T-Pain where that pole up 
 And I ain't talkin' metal I'm talkin' 
 Hold the fuckin' sunshine 
 Tell wifey you 'bout to roll what 
 And it ain't Kush wet hash or haze 
 It's them lips legs and ass 
 That fuckin' amaze 
 Come ride if you're comin' my way 
 And all night still the way I play then (ok) 
 Now what you sayin' again? 
 Tell me what it's hittin' for 
 You only got 4 minutes like 
 I'm 'bout to spit it 
 Doin' 5, I hit the door (whoa) 
 Don't talk just do it 
 Don't beat around the bush get to it 
 Hope you got your wing up 
 Better drink a Redbull 
 In a minute I'm a make you lose it 
 You lose it, you lose it 
 CB goin' make you lose it 
 I got my low cut jeans 
 You can see my G-String 
 Guaranteed I'm a make you lose it 
 Charli got the good and plenty (plenty) 
 I'm a perform for you (for you) 
 I hope you didn't bite off 
 More than you can chew (chew) 
 Go ahead and take a shot of Henne (Henne) 
 'Cause I'm about to work you out (ow) 
 No need for conversation ('sation) 
 Just show me what you're all about (ow!) 
 The metal to the pedal, skip the chit-chat 
 Mix Sprite with dip-n-dab and told 'em sit back 
 10 minutes later you feelin' that kick back 
 Get kicked in my flick, I hand picked 'em 
 Stressed to lick their, seat belt clicked and 
 He clicked off, I got hit off and I ain't victim 
 Bounce game sickening, that's the way I play 
 But all night after hustling, you need to stay (ok) 
 Now what you sayin' again? 
 Tell me what it's hittin' for 
 You only got 4 minutes like 
 I'm 'bout to spit it 
 Doin' 5, I hit the door (whoa) 
 Don't talk just do it 
 Don't beat around the bush get to it 
 Hope you got your wing up 
 Better drink a Redbull 
 In a minute I'm a make you lose it 
 You lose it, you lose it 
 CB goin' make you lose it 
 I got my low cut jeans 
 You can see my G-String 
 Guaranteed I'm a make you lose it
