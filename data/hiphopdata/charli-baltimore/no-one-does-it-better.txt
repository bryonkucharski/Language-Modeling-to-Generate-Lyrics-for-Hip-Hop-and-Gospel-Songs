(Hook: Ashanti) 
 Na na na na na la la la la 
 Na na na na na la la la la 
 Na na na na na la la la la 
 No one does it like Murder Inc. 
 Na na na na na la la la la 
 Na na na na na la la la la 
 Na na na na na la la la la 
 Baby, no one does it like Murder Inc. 
 (Charli Baltimore) 
 Ain't none better, repeat the letters 
 Murder I-N-C fucka, we go together, Lord 
 When you see the pink hair the Inc. here 
 Fuck - we can do it mixtape or dubbed 
 And by the underground bastards, appeal to the masses 
 Style like Jackie on asses, come through with Jackie on glasses 
 Protectin yo asses, 7 inch classes, F**K y'all bastards 
 G - catch a wiff of the murderous bitch, the murderous clique 
 Like you never heard of the G 
 From the muscle like crime life like corner hustlers 
 And the, tunner winter shit, tell me I ain't a winner 
 ??, Got my mind on my money and my money in my pocket 
 Who the fuck gon' stop it, time for the honey is up 
 So dummy it up, who the F**K gon' knock it 
 Now that The Inc. locked it, Chuck 
 (Charli Baltimore) 
 We got vision by I.G. - hook by Ashanti 
 Got Chuck spittin', where the fuck y'all fit in 
 Those without my name recognition 
 C.B. - bitch of the commission, still play my position 
 Oh, won't settle, put the foot to the pedal 
 And knee short Staletto's, the chick is still ghetto 
 Hold the bitch down, but not on her 
 I'm rissen, mind driven like hundred mile commissions 
 How I'm spittin', niggaz is rewritin, and I'm just bullshittin 
 Gon' know when I'm hittin (uh) 
 Wrists start slittin, I'm killin' 'em soft 
 A Predator, Slow Burn and I'm killin' 'em off 
 Now, back to back let's pace it, 5 steps 
 Who wanna test the streets is on a record 
 187 mami, click behind me, y'all know what the sellin be 
 Kill 'em with the melody, Chuck 
 (Charli Baltimore) 
 Now who that baige bitch poppin' that shit like she cocky eyed 
 Inc. mami, bitch know how to find me 
 Out till the late night, studio trouble maker 
 Ass don't know how to take a (Murderous) love the hater 
 Flows like an elevator, 'cause each level I'm up, I get off 
 Fucker, who wanna cross the line 
 It's real thin with a pad and a pen 
 And I spit 10 and throw y'all 6 for the win 
 Again - y'all heard me, niggaz thought but the chicks all girly 
 Body all curvy, F**K how the world be 
 I'm mobbin' on the top of y'all 
 I-N-C and C.B. cock-blockin' y'all, Chuck
