(Ghostface) 
 Be friends wit'cha gram! 
 I want everyone to stand up and be counted tonight 
 Hey you, blow your whistle [whistle sound] 
 Now clap ya hands and say yeah! (yeah) 
 (Ghostface) 
 Tune my voice out, tune my mic out 
 Tune my voice out, tune my mic out 
 Yo, this is how we rock 
 This is how we rock

 Hey you, blow your whistle [whistle sound]

 Yo, yo, yo 
 Yo tony, what up? 
 Heard your dick was good 
 (Ghostface) 
 You should know, yo I fucked you on the side of my hood 
 (Charli) 
 Never that dawg 
 From where you can never hit it 
 Throw a razor in my mouth on the low 
 And suck ya dick wit' it 
 (Ghostface) 
 The world famous, priceless, still stainless dick 
 Pray over this, scoped ya love, nameless 
 Heavyweight dick in ya jaw 
 Good lickin' fom ya lips, now babygirl throw the song 
 (Charli) 
 Yo, yo, yo 
 Aye yo Tony, you phoney 
 We both signed to Sony 
 But for half ya pub, ride that dick like a Pony, what 
 (Ghostface) 
 Yeah, what, put your money on my dick 
 Girls, all eyes on my dick 
 (Charli) 
 Yo, yo, yo 
 Cats fatigued out, thinkin' they armies 
 My crew arms me with beats, how we swarm bee? 
 Who bang?, B'More and Wu Tang, new thang 
 Mad at how we do thangs, RZA cop me two fangs 
 Official, now I bite through gristle 
 Gold teeth style in from Philly to Stanton Island 
 While in the meantime, spit mean lines 
 Fuck clean rhymes, like mine's grimmy 
 Like my niggas be 
 Picture me, coming off soft 
 Y'all just cough up shit, I swallow rhymes 
 Makin' bitches swallow 9's, re-define 
 This rap shit, make my shit a classic 
 Like Bethoven, stay posin' 
 For the camera, stamina 
 Like a crackhead, and crackheads are amauters 
 You try me, no in-between like Y to Z 
 Pick brains like labotomies 
 Still thoughts to charts of Billboard's 
 Throw pour ill spores, leave niggsa stiff like still-born's 
 I want all you brothers and sisters to stand up 
 (What, what, what) 
 I want everybody to stand up and be counted tonight 
 (Stand up baby, stand up baby) 
 Brothers and sisters, if you know you've got your thing together 
 I want you to stand on up! 
 (Stand up yo) 
 Now I got something to tell ya 
 I'll tell you, now that I think about it 
 (Yeah, what, what, what) 
 And now I wanna tell ya how to get your thing together 
 (Ghostface) 
 I'm like Spider-Man's fifth brohter up in the Clan 
 Drop like crap's that's scattered all up in ya van 
 Skelly-man crook, character star 
 In Donna Boines book 
 MGM, Heaven and Hell, sat with the cook 
 With the big spice bone, red hair's is killin' me 
 Knotted up, twisted and green 
 Seen them crystal's in that rap yo 
 And get Barear 
 Bear hug and five hundered ounce of that Staision 
 Wild man, Sarah 
 Rush after hours, Alpha in the beds 
 Caked hands like Dai Smith, rap haggler with a fade 
 Magillia, Charli Baltimore with Hazel driftin' withdrawels 
 Wind Face start with the Killah 
 Stood still, a whole river chill 
 Looked up and got dogged, that's when RZA started to build 
 Hey yeah! 
 I want all you brothers and sisters to stand up 
 Hey yeah! 
 I want all you brothers and sisters to stand up 
 Hey you, blow your whistle [whistle sound] 
 (Charli) 
 What, what, what, what! 
 (Ghostface) 
 Aye yo, you craze me, turtleneck nigga rockin' Pasley 
 Shots crazily, steady blazin' where the spaids be 
 Teams like Starsky and Hutch, you put deluxe truck 
 Ya bankrupt, 52's Knox, I heard you Ku Klux, damn 
 Tear it out the van, sweat it with a tan 
 With get like Remo spray can, suga the ram 
 Fuck a cocktail, get my balls licked in Hell 
 Read his Igloo Tales, hell all the dogs with broken tails 
 Salt range, short order tab 
 Ironman, bubble bath, nuclear, split the atom in half 
 Meet dime O's, fifth brother bug inside 8 pole 
 Change though, crush the birds inside the strip pose 
 (Charli) 
 Rap Conspiracy, hold songs for ransom 
 Lancin' in Ghostmode, coke mixed with Branson 
 Sheisty, tree's soaked in half-ki's 
 Sabotage N.Y. with snipe's and 79's 
 Channel 9's scene street team made news with who's 
 Charli, every 16 bars be 
 Sickening, peep the scription 
 Rhyme vixen 
 Keep the clips in tact, watch ya back 
 Ain't done yet, 8-Spunett 
 Poison webbers 
 Spider-Woman, two legged, how we did it 
 What! 
 Come on and get a groove goin'! 
 Hey you, blow your whistle [whistle sound] 
 Hey you, blow your whistle [whistle sound] 
 Now clap your hands and say yeah 
 Yeah... 
 Now let me count it off 
 1... 2... 3 
 Hey 
 Hey, hey, hey yeah! 
 I want all you brothers and sisters to stand up
