Artist: charli baltimore f/ DJ premier 
 Yeah, what 
 (Charli baltimore) 
 Bout to lay it down for these muthafuckas 
 (Charli baltimore) 
 What, speakin' on c. b'more 
 Yo, uh, yo, yo 
 Verse one 
 Now everybody wanna know the outcome, of went I come out 
 My roads to success, pay dues, with the thumb out 
 Hitch-hike, from she aight, to she's the nicest 
 I permit chicks to front, now I got a license what 
 Everybody wanna know if I spit my own hits 
 Come to any session, any song in question 
 Drop 48 bars on spots like remixes 
 All hoes do is add on my words like prefixes 
 Roll 'thorough bitches' from deep south to these sixes 
 Been way past cats ideas of mad riches 
 Phone numbers, bank accounts 
 They gon' match the time, what 
 9-9-9, 9-9, 9-9 
 And the punchline, give my best thoughts at "crunch time" 
 I drop cats front, part 2, three much 
 You want, hot shit, pop shit or some toxic 
 Underground gossip, '99, I lock shit, what 
 (DJ premier) 
 'Charli baltimore' <-- charli

 'The commission... get it right' 
 'Charli baltimore' <-- charli

 Verse two 
 Yo, uh, yo 
 Now everybody wanna know the price 
 Go soft in the rays, in other words b, meltin' they ice 
 Lyrically price, mostly rap cats, nigga 
 So if I dis ya, better have them 48-master mister 
 Or misses, bitches, came in beemo with preim-o 
 Jet flight like flocks, in l.v., reno 
 Casino, I'll play ginger, I don't need no 
 Divas, see her, niggas wanna see us 
 Fall off, only thing we do is parl' off 
 If it's beef, only thing you do is call off 
 Talkin' about starter, please, we got is sewed up 
 When we got shows where you're at, don't even show up 
 Niggas need to grow up, step they flow up 
 Accept they diamonds won't blow up, and put they dough up 
 On how I grow up, and know what 
 Catch you on the charli, you don't blown up 
 Check the dial tone...

 Verse three 
 Yo, yo, uh 
 Now everybody wanna know my third, verse-atile 
 Niggas still tryin' to worry if I'm worth they wild 
 Why rap about clothes, I'ma merchantile 
 Legally the hot shit, in reverse awhile 
 Attachin' ideas to it, in my years, you through 
 In no time, I blow mine's, forget it, you who? 
 C-h-a-r-l-i, dot it, no 'e' 
 Ain't never been spotted, shit, nigga can throw me 
 Can't nobody hold me to nothin' they can't show me 
 Knew half now, and half now, do the math now 
 See who laughs now, e-mail, not free mail 
 Get the heffers like e-mail, rhyme with such detail 
 Geared to my songs like seashells, de-rail 
 Rappers off my track if they album is wacked 
 Half the tat's on my back, you can see me head on 
 Yeah me, get'cha red on point, be dead on, uh
