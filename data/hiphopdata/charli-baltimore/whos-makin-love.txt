 Verse One 
 C.B. can get to your head, if you let me 
 Or give ya hed, if you let me 
 When you met me, never bet we'd be 
 Bumpin' and grindin' 
 Wore short skirts and drop shit when you was behind me 
 Design ways to fuck with no craze 
 'Cause I know you've known my man's since 3rd grade, I stayed 
 Pure through his whores and tore's, overseas 
 You and me, too long 
 Look opposite you ball 
 Lil' sis', so you say 
 Wanna fuck me Tony?, Scarface-way with Gina, I mean the... 
 Signs be there, time we share, be sweet 
 Fuck that reckless till we shred the sheets 
 To confetti, ready, picture teddy and gaurders 
 Play Marta, I'm smarter 
 Rub tit's, part lips, and watch you, I got you 
 Will powers down, got the ship mapped out 
 Cause that nigga's leaving town 
 Who's makin' love to your old lady 
 While you're out makin' love 
 (You don't really wanna know) 
 Who's makin' love to your old lady 
 While you're out makin' love 
 Verse Two 
 Soakin' in the bubbles, by Body Shine 
 Dreamin' 'bout you, wanna wake up 
 Suckin' on my "A" cups, make up 
 Reasons to see you 
 I can tell you want it, all you gotta do is 
 Push up on that 
 Ask ya nigga, you loyal?, drunk off Crown Royale 
 Tellin' me how he be gettin' down out of town 
 What he don't know, won't hurt him 
 One squirt through my tight skirt, then we can fuck all the flirtin' 
 All I gotta figure is, how to pull this nigga 
 Fool my nigga, but he dumb anyway 
 And his chime, anyday now, have me in the hay now 
 Dirty ass way down, I'm still gon' lay down 
 He on his way now, to keep me company 
 Little did he know, when he show 
 He'll be bumpin' me, humpin' me 
 Wantin' me to open my mouth 
 Let him spit in it, take the wetness, suck his dick wit' it 
 Who's makin' love to your old lady 
 While you're out makin' love 
 (You don't really wanna know) 
 Who's makin' love to your old lady 
 While you're out makin' love 
 Verse Three 
 Knock-knock, who is it? 
 I'm coming, make me cum in 
 Five minutes or less, two seconds, I'm undressed 
 Open the door, threw him to the floor 
 Wanna whore like Del Rio, tell me no, take that, know my steelo 
 Dick's hard, feel tights like a vice grip 
 Or nice lips, both sex, I'm a veteran 
 You better win, I'm on top, don't stop 
 Do it faster, fuck you bastard, got it mastered 
 Yeah yeah, so glad you gave in 
 I'm about to cave in, be your sex slave and 
 I'm dumb and I'm about to... 
 (Guy) 
 Yo, yo, yo, C.B. what's up? boo 
 (Charli) 
 Oh shit, what are you doing here? 
 I though you left, I... I was just sleep 
 (Guy) 
 What you mean yo? 
 Yo what's going on, why you sweatin' like that too? 
 (Charli) 
 I... I was dreamin' 
 I was dreamin' 
 (Guy) 
 Oh shit, you was dreamin' about me? 
 (Charli) 
 Uh heh, not really 
 (Guy) 
 What you mean not really! 
 (Charli) 
 I'm mean, yeah, yo baby, of course, yeah 
 (Come on babe) 
 Who's makin' love to your old lady

 Who's makin' love to your old lady 
 While you're out makin' love
