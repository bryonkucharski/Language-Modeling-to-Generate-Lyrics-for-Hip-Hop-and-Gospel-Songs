[Guy] Hey Charli, hey Charli, hey Charli 
 [Guy] She's unbelievable and she wit 
 [ChB] I-N-C 
 [Guy] Hey Charli 
 [ChB] Catch me runnin' red lights, niggaz beamin they headlights 
 [Guy] Hey Charli 
 [ChB] 187 be the digits only numbers you getting nigga 
 [Guy] Hey Charli 
 [ChB] See me with the angels, ass from all angles 
 [Guy] She's unbelievable and she wit 
 [ChB] I-N-C 
 We throw a club in the clique nigga 
 I need a thug and a drink 
 Scream "The Inc" Till I'm "Gone" like N'SYNC 
 Bitches born for the scene 
 Ass fat like it was born in them jeans 
 They come on to my team 
 Now we on to a scheme 
 Ready for the tape on 
 Face on 
 Ass is up never 
 Glasses up better 
 Fuck it we brown paper baggin off the wagon 
 See who worth taggin 
 I play wit 'em but no slidin off 
 I'm watchin him expression as I'm ridin' off 
 Play 2-way tag but I'm not for baggin 
 Who press cats? Me 
 I was back like Jet Lagan 
 Your fuckin' wit a I.G. associate 
 Want a dose of it? 
 Can't come close to it 
 Keep it brief like our game is been 
 With more albums I score see who worth more 
 Now I play gats, knives wit 'em 'cause I love to chase 
 22"s on the Lex got 'em lovin' my taste 
 Love ta pace 
 Mac doors got 'em lovin' my face 
 38" on the waste you wastin wit your place 
 I don't know you better then I don't show you 
 But who's behind my chicks 
 Never mind 
 Never mind we never find one worth the energy 
 My angels on Hennessey thinking they see enemy 
 So keep it spinnin like Rule records on radios 
 Even out the ratio 7 and 1 
 All chicks from the front and the back 
 All cliques aw shit we here whenever we near 
 Sweetheart I ain't tryna swell you let me tell you 
 If you can bitter or spit me you can hit me 
 Shit I ain't met one yet 
 Ain't settlin foot to the pedal and cats keep on yellin' 
 Ok 
 Can go deeper then replies on the beeper 
 Ill work wit ya but lemme see if I fit ya 
 I'm more complex then dinner and a movie 
 Nigga you gotta move me 
 A bitch kinda moody 
 So what's the plan of action 
 Get it crakin 
 What you working wit lets see if I can work wit it 
 I'm no amateur game master 
 He has ta lay the mack down a little faster bastard 
 Too slow and I'm dustin 'em one up 
 Play the hood till the sun up they run up in 
 I'm skirtin no flirtin 
 I ain't checkin' 'em niggaz still got the plot thickenin (thickenin) 
 [Chorus] - repeat 2X
