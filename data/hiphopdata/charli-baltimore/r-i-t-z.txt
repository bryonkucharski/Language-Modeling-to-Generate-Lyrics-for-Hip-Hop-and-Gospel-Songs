Charli Baltimore 
 Killa Cam 
 Cam'Ron 
 Charli I don't think they know that I'm menstrul 
 Let me tell 'em when I'm menstrul 
 (Verse One: Cam'Ron) 
 I'm into don thing, Donna Karen 
 Don Cornelius, Don King 
 Lunchin' down in Palm Springs 
 Long the ring, crackin' cars 
 Dirty money, give the wax to Juan 
 Actin' harsh, leave 'em my back garage 
 Thug niggas using Mack Guitar 
 Givin' back massuage, enterouage, we on Hollis 
 Make you leave New York quicker, then John Wallace 
 Be in your mom's wallet 
 Y'all want whips, it's time on trial 
 Aye yo, y'all want chips, then count ya stride 
 I made best friend to fight yo, like '98 Live 
 Connin' in they eyes, like cats behind with they wife 
 Well then it's true, that I lost a daughter 
 Niggas get a little money, wanna cross the water 
 Fuckin' sell, I get the hell, I can't cross the border 
 Never feminine, everynight don't park the six 
 Right in front of tenimens 
 Ruthless chicks, yeah, toothless chicks 
 With the shotguns to shot, right through 2 and 6 
 Rufus kicks, uqick, that's what I'm tellin' my man 
 They just want me on the crucifix, I held in my hand 
 Fell for the plan, felony Cam 
 Yo melody be bland! 
 R-I-P scrams yo, a hell of a man 
 And that's my analysis, till I'm laid up with blood like diolisists 
 That's my next son 
 (Chorus (Cam'Ron)) 
 Some niggas kiss 
 And some get dissed 
 Some cats go kill 
 And jump off cliffs 
 Some snitch 
 But life's a fucking bitch 
 Some niggas sniff 
 And some go disp 
 Some cats want dough 
 And come on clicks 
 Some rich 
 But life's a fucking bitch 
 (Verse Two: Charli Baltimore) 
 What, yo 
 I'm into Ice shit, peirced pussy 
 Got the Ice clit, Ice picks 
 Fuck around and slice chicks 
 Spotted deserve on Ice chips 
 Tight click, we come through 
 Dumb crew, these cats unable to come to 
 Comotose, y'all boast about holdin' totes 
 We hold's parties, and sign our labels Pacardi 
 Hardly ya girl next door, beofre I was B'More 
 I was C-4, now I'm packed, and now I'm stackin' 
 In the Swiss Alps, with Swiss cheese and Swiss accounts 
 Sippin' Swiss Miss, hoes frontin', got me kissed it 
 Dying kids wanna see B'More, on they wish list 
 But I put 'em there, be careful what you ask for 
 Ski mask up on barren face 
 No trace, of DNA, just DOA 
 We know ways to make you talk 
 Make you limp, when you walk 
 Outline cats in white chalk 
 Got fagotts askin' "Who's she?" 
 Benz wit' it, class be E, Master P 
 Blastin' 'How Ya Do Dat There' 
 Ridin' through, niggas stare, they like "Who dat there?" 
 Is True Dat wear 
 Takin' over, slower 
 While y'all hoes be stressed 
 Hate to see me and PD, and be like who the ebst 
 No shit, pull out the clips 
 Pull out the whips, put out the hits 
 'Cause we put on the Ritz 
 And it's nine crackers before a cracker 
 So tell me how you like us with guns and rappers 
 (Chorus (Cam'Ron)) 
 Some niggas kiss 
 And some get dissed 
 Some cats go kill 
 And jump off cliffs 
 Some snitch 
 But life's a fucking bitch 
 Some niggas sniff 
 And some go disp 
 Some cats want dough 
 And come on clicks 
 Some rich 
 But life's a fucking bitch 
 Some niggas kiss 
 And some get dissed 
 Some cats go kill 
 And jump off cliffs 
 Some snitch 
 But life's a fucking bitch 
 Some niggas sniff 
 And some go disp 
 Some cats want dough 
 And come on clicks 
 Some rich 
 But life's a fucking bitch
