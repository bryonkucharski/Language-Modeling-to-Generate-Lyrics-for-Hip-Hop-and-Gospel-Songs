 Yo, all around I rip this 
 The song had to clip it 
 The cats in the street, nearly killing over snippets 
 Birds out to feed 'em bread, so he can eat her head 
 I'm almost 21, but I still pee in the bed 
 Had to flead the FED's, all be trife 
 And I got a crush on Edith (who, Archie's wife!) 
 Yo not Monaghomy, pornograhy 
 On the outside, lookin' apauled you see 
 Tell my girls, I really like photography 
 On snap shots naked, the wildest boys 
 First night, head whop, and our salads tossed 
 While you in a mean neon, I'm with Celine Dion 
 Throw her in the bed, she the next one I pee on 
 Say what bitch 
 Phase two 
 Yeah yeah 
 What what what 
 What what 
 What what what 
 What what what 
 What what what 
 Split that ass yo 
 Split that ass 
 Yeah uh, what 
 Yo yo yo 
 (Noreaga) 
 Yo, N-O-R-E eatin' 
 Fuck y'all, niggas get hurt 
 You know I rock a Soul Train wit' a Cam'Ron's shirt 
 Doin' cartwheels, all my niggas got Hot Wheels 
 You a double A-R god, the bluntiest 
 You know we throw away, blunts for my niggas that's dead 
 Pour a Law Liqour, drink a long ligga 
 Then again I never beat, for my nigga Digga 
 You know I got, navigators, so we won't get lost 
 N-O-R-E eatin', these Queens niggas call me the Force 
 At the airainment, Thugged Out 
 Untertainment, throw around and fuck 'em if the judge say shit 
 And I - get - what - niggas face it 
 (Charli Baltimore) 
 Fools ain't ever know, the ghetto's be the baddest click 
 Charli's Angels, tangle with Devil's - Advocate 
 Hoes mad cause our pussy's got the fattest clits 
 It's estatic shit, how we gon' have a bitch 
 Under pressure, the Un undress her 
 That's a tester, that's just the best flirt, to the best skirt 
 Ever make it to networks 
 Like N.B.C., N.O.R.E., B'More and Cam'Ron 
 Anything we put our hands on, soak up like a tampon, plan on 
 For puttin' out the hottest LP's 
 Since - shiiit yo, you gon' have to tell me 
 Cause this is hip hop, meneaja twat 
 And y'all jealous 'cause what I'm fuckin' wit' the two hottest 
 Underground fellas, what! 
 (Chorus (Noreaga, Baltimore, Cam'Ron)) 
 Aye yo Iraq, Harlem World, Philly

 (Cam'Ron) 
 Yo, all on the ballers shit 
 Nore, but we could call a chick 
 Head is what we all could get, biggest to the smallest dick 
 She gon' swallow all of it 
 Harlem gon' have a ball with that 
 After I get her pregnant, yo we goin' to the mall with it 
 (Noreaga) 
 Yeah nigga, you know the lie, fuck that bitch 
 The only reason I don't kiss her, is 'cause she sucked his dick 
 Yo I don't even try ta, us up bro 
 Fuck dat hoe 
 Pussy stinkin' anyway, let her go 
 (Charli Baltimore) 
 Yo y'all niggas stay fuckin' with them grimmy chicks 
 On the real though, I wonder where y'all find these chicks 
 The rest is evident, I'm the type to split on niggas 
 But if they right, I'll fuck around and spit on niggas 
 And if they into that hot shit, I'll let 'em hit my spot quick 
 But first they gotta pop shit 
 If not then they gettin' drop kicked 
 And I like 'em all, Black Jack y'all 
 Near 21, all others gettin' cut cut 
 So be it, you see me!
