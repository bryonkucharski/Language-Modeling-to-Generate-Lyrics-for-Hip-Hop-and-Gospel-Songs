Eh yo, Perc eh, yo, what's up? 
 Eh yo, kick some ol' lung collapsing lyrics 
 For the feeble minded MCs to assimilate, all right 
 Yo, let the homicides begin 
 I know what you mean, yo, give me the mic 
 I'm the capital P-E-R-C-double E dash P-P dash double E-C-R-E-P in me 
 Shots in top lyrical fitness that's why you bit this 
 Get this, I got a witness and I won't quit this 
 And flip flop, get dropped, shit I'm in tip top shape 
 Lyrics escape, can't even catch him with tape 
 Main attraction using my brain a fraction 
 Of my knowledge or wisdom a lyrical rhythm'll give 'em 
 A migraine, before I reign on stage 
 You better walk like the fingers on a yellow page 
 Rhymes and homicides are lethal, nobody's equal to me 
 No one survived, so why make a sequel? 
 MC Percee P give no mercy to anybody MC'in till they reimburse me 
 I cold grip the mic, strike then rip his life 
 My raps dilapidate adversaries with kryptonite 
 Hit you with a verse, make you disperse but first 
 Call up a hearse 'cause Perc leave you worse than this 
 Brain cells shatter, MCs scatter 
 I splatter them all with something that ain't even matter 
 Got a ladder on stage women runnin', comin' every age 
 But never (?) ring on my finger this thing'll linger un-engaged 
 Renegade, Percee P ain't afraid of no one 
 No gun or son, I'm gettin' paid and my rec's played 
 Every weekend like lottery, rap's a part of me 
 Words flow but don't show no blood in you artery 
 Ladies greet me, treat me like the stars 
 When I show up they start to throw up all their panties and bras at me 
 Rap is the last of me now to gas women with my pencil 
 I send you into a mental catastrophe 
 This rhyme ain't designed for prime time 
 And a battle line for logic behind every mind 
 Tryin' to rhyme with intellect, spellin' all incorrect 
 Defy your every line, mine's an introspective 
 Those in the premises will always remember this 
 Record, elected your top ten, stop then and reminisce 
 Percee P, no rapper get worse than me 
 When it comes to rhymes every verse will be 
 Harder than titanium, parts from your cranium 
 Burst, disperse, every verse explodes like uranium 
 So, yo, don't upset me, 'cause that will only get me 
 Mad enough, it's bad enough, I had enough of 
 Lettin' this amateur rock a cord or wallabies 
 I bet they're all the P's 
 And if they ain't they gonna be 
 To all y'all critics, just admit it 
 My style is dope 
 You can't cope and you hope to get it 
 You're captivated, activated, rap related fans leave infatuated 
 When I get open the place starts smokin' 
 You start chokin', showboat and Perc get broken 
 Rehearse a while, let it get versatile 
 I reverse your style, ok, be then maybe Perc'll smile 
 You're put in a stretcher 
 When I let the style get ya', I bet ya' 
 Sweat the Rhyme Inspector 
 Records you manufacture are so wack you can't 
 Sing 'em or bring 'em, people fling 'em back at ya 
 You're the fattest, baddest, of the best copycata's 
 When you played it, it's rated G for garbage 'cause that's your status 
 Nobodies iller 
 On the mic you never know when I'mma strike 'em like the Zodiac killer 
 This twenty two year old veteran, you ain't better than 
 Medicine won't help, slicks think we're peddlin' 
 When writers bite and hype the type parasites swipe 
 You're bitin', you're stage fright, don't even hold the mic right 
 Yeah, this is the Rhyme Inspector Percee P coming from the Boogie Down Bronx 
 I want to give a shout out to the Ultramagnetic, Organized Konfusion 
 To everybody around the way at Paterson Projects, I want to say peace 
 I dedicate this to my cousin, Kevin Turner, rest in peace
