 You see tha ice twink we I talk, ya blink and ya dead 
 I'll let a hollow tip sink in ya head, so think it over 
 'Fore they find ya ass hangin' over a bridge and shit 
 While I'm out drinkin' wit tha squad like I ain't did tha shit 
 I really hope ya click come back for revenge and shit 
 I'll make bullets drop on ya block like pidgeon shit 
 A nigga duct tape ya ????? don't get me pissed 
 Put hollow tips in clips like chips in dip 
 Bitch nigga here could flip tha script, ya not built for dat 
 Ya not soldiers, ya get killed for dat

 An niggas respect tha shots, make 'em tilt your hat (what you)

 Come on tell tha truth nigga - man yes we do 
 An you don't want no drama nigga - yes we do 
 Come on tell tha truth nigga - man yes we do 
 (B.G.) 
 My name still B.G., we it's said it rang a bell 
 In rich neighborhoods, middle class hoods, & jails 
 I'm a street nigga, sold ounces of crack cocaine 
 If I spit it, I did it, before I got in this rap game 
 One of my hobbies is beef, do that for pleasure 
 It's nothin' to bust a head, put a few wholes in ya sweater 
 Never get in a situation wit me involvin' guns 
 Never able to sleep always on tha run 
 One way or another you gonna come 
 Outta isolation, if it mean killin' ya ?? 
 You thinkin' 'cause I'm rappin' and be on television 
 That I won't soften ya head and come split it 
 Close range is fake, bustin' from a distance 
 Tha shit I'm talkin' my nigga, I'm still livin' 
 If any nigga want it, can get it wit no problem 
 All these niggas playin' but me, I come to stop it 
 (Turk) 
 I don't play nigga 
 Better watch what ya say nigga 
 'Cause I fuck up ya day nigga 
 Wit this K nigga, I gets very low down 
 Give a fuck about a nigga, hit 'em wit fifty rounds 
 I'm from uptown, young and thuggin' since I was small 
 Grew up around killas, hung wit tha big dawgs 
 Nigga we play it raw as it go, were I stay 
 Run ya mouth too much, get found in a hall way 
 Wit a head shot, look that's how niggas get it 
 Keep it on a tuck, nobody know who did it 
 No evidence, no witness, you just assed out 
 Busta ass nigga, you just assed out 
 Fuckin' wit a guerilla ah untamed one at that 
 You leave ya house in ya want I bet ya won't make it back 
 You could believe that, look betta get it right 
 Get it twisted if ya want, I betcha gonna loose ya life nigga 
 (Mack 10) 
 (Uh ha, yo, yo) 
 All I know is dope slangin' and gang bangin' 
 Inglewood Cali swangin' and hood hangin' 
 I'm a ghetto nigga, saggin', starched, & creased 
 Wit everythang fa' sale from a ki to a quarter piece 
 Like Baby tha bird, got tha game on lock 
 An while them youngstas workin' tha block, I'm, cookin' a flock 
 I'm ballin' and if I'm beefin', I laid for 'em 
 But tha murders committed recently, I paid for 'em 
 I got a crew of noodle knockers that'll wait in tha bushes 
 Wet you up and have you bitches blood runnin' like douches 
 I'm bout murda, murda, dope, dope, leave bitch niggas no hope 
 Don't need a red beam 'cause we sight 'em wit tha scope 
 Yeah you talk that shit, then grab a gun nigga 
 But if Mack call tha shot, it's good as done nigga 
 Cause tha base from tha fo' fo' be bangin' like a drum 
 An it's cash Money blood, so fuck where you from nigga
