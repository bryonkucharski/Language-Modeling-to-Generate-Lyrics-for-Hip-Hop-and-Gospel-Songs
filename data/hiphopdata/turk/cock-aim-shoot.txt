Nigga this that gangsta shit 
 If you a gangsta you gon feel this, you understand 
 This for my niggas who be totin that motherfuckin metal 
 You understand, in any kind of weather, ya heard me 
 It's going down nigga seven days a week 
 365 days a year nigga 
 Look Look 
 (Turk) 
 Nigga my trigga finger itchy, don't get it twisted 
 'Cause if you do nigga I'm gon start splittin 
 Please believe me, believe me please 
 Give that ass a dome shining 
 Blucka blucka to your fuckin' knees 
 Six feet deep is where you gon sleep 
 Fuckin' with me you get slugs fuckin' with me 
 Get in in blood nigga fuckin' with me 
 Original hot boy nigga real as can be 
 I talk that talk, but I could walk that walk 
 If I say I mean it nigga I don't just bark 
 I cock and spark, betta look out for them sharks 
 I don't give a fuck nigga if its daylight or dark 
 I have no heart, My shit freezing cold 
 No love for no nigga, that's how it goes 
 So nigga take it how you wanna bring it how you feel 
 Slip and make the wrong then I bet you get killed 
 (Chorus: repeat 2X) 
 When I cock, aim, shoot you betta run duck and hide 
 'Cause it's all on you, 'cause when my bullets cut loose 
 Got one wit your name nigga Oh yes its true 
 (Turk) 
 When beef start that's when eliminating is a must 
 Time to saddle up grab them 4 pounds and bust 
 My nigga biggie riding with me 
 We gon throw down and bust 
 Fifty shots out the choppa, when we thrown down and bust 
 Taking no prisoners, when we thrown down and bust 
 Shoot em' up and bang bang, when we throw down and bust 
 Gotta problem I'ma assault me a nigga, I don't give a fuck 
 Spin the corner in a Taurus nigga, your ass out of luck 
 You're stuck just like two dogs my nigga 
 Ain't gon be a pretty site at all my nigga (at all my nigga) 
 Look, you die fast not slow 
 The last thing you see is flames and gun smoke 
 Gotta go and wont come back no more 
 Like jack you won't come back no more 
 That's law, look nigga feel me though 
 'Cause I ain't gon stop till you kill me yo 
 (Chorus: repeat 2X) 
 When I cock, aim, shoot you betta run duck and hide 
 'Cause it's all on you, 'cause when my bullets cut loose 
 Got one wit your name nigga Oh yes its true 
 (Turk) 
 Look, I'm telling you 
 Nigga I'm gon speak one time 
 One time only after that no more 
 And bullets start stormin I'm wettin you up 
 Talk shit then I'm shuttin you up 
 Motherfucker, thankin' your teflon 
 And you got nine lives 
 Better think again for you get shot nine times 
 Cross the gun line you don't wanna do that 
 You don't wanna go to war you ain't ready for that 
 It gets deep you thinkin' you could swim, my nigga 
 In the water with the sharks I don't think so 
 Put your chest spray your back though 
 It ain't a game, take heat apon a sayin' 
 It's a true fact though, some people call me whacko 
 'Cause I whack niggas 
 Dressed in all black with the chrome mac nigga 
 I'ma project nigga from the dirty south 
 Where the murder rate high and them thugs be out
