 They got this nigga named 
 Rob, and 
 Rob is my dog 
 His people doin' bad, sometimes I break him off I got love for the nigga - 'round my way, they doin' bad 
 He ain't worried 'bout it, he just keep his head up 
 Every time we come outside, we say, "Look at they dirty ass." 
 Some days, my dog don't have nothin' to eat 
 And say, "One day, I'ma be straight. 
 Y'all just watch when I come up." 
 Man, that shit is cold, but sometime that's how it be 
 His momma on stones, daddy on hero'n 
 Whole household fucked up - all of them bitches gone 
 Knowin' I be with they son every day of the week 
 Dog, they know they gone, tryin' to score from me 
 But they don't care - fuck that, not gon' play it like that 
 Even though shit fucked up, my round still be chillin' 
 That's my motherfuckin' round, so I'ma give him respect 
 Gettin' it how he live in this project livin' (Hook - 
 Hakiem) 
 In the project, niggas don't wan' see you come up 
 You don't give 'em what they want, they gon' fuck your head up 
 Like a man, bruh - you know how it be goin' down 
 Nigga be straight project when they livin' uptown 
 In the project, you know niggas be stun'n, round 
 If a nigga don't play ya nigga, go lay your ass down 
 Like a man, bruh - you know how it be goin' down 
 Nigga be straight thuggin' when they livin' uptown (Turk) 
 Look 
 Verse two, and I'ma talk about these project broads 
 Gettin' how they could, anyway that they can 
 Stealin' clothes, gettin' hustles, usin' them credit cards 
 Wearin' each other clothes, fuckin' each other man 
 Gotta respect they mind, let 'em do what they do 
 Broads like to look good, and they like to shine, too 
 Havin' babies like that ain't nothin' for niggas with names 
 Them hoes love a nigga with that project fame 
 Sittin' on the porch, just gossipin' 
 This shit's real - get it how they live in the brick 'Bout any and everything that be happenin' 
 They do whatever it takes to keep a lil' cake 
 You should know how it is if you live in the bricks 
 Catch them a duck, they want everything that he make 
 Yeah, they play it raw, but I ain't mad at 'em I just let 'em do they thing, dog, I ain't mad at 'em (Hook - 
 Hakiem) (Turk) 
 Everyday, it's the same old shit, but different toilets 
 Either you're hustlin' or you're starvin' like 
 Marvin 
 Livin' from (??) to (?), beggin' niggas for jo's 'Cause ain't no nigga gon' give you shit, get it for yourself 
 Gettin' played like a junky, disrespected by hoes 
 Flip till you can't flip no more for yourself 
 Gotta get off your ass - make it happen, my nigga, 
 Nigga, look, don't worry 'bout the next nigga 
 They gon' hate ya anyway, and that's a fact, nigga 
 Even if it come down to you pullin' that trigga 
 So while they hatin', you just keep doin' your thing 
 Nigga get outta line is when you let your nuts hang 
 You don't give 'em what they want, they just fuck your head up 
 In the project, nigga don't wan' see you come up 
 Like a man, bruh - you know how it be goin' down 
 Nigga be straight project livin' uptown (Hook-2x (Hakiem)) 
 In the project, niggas don't wan' see you come up
