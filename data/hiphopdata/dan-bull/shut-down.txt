Shizzy VI 
 Good day to all Americans, I'm here with a catastrophe 
 And a number of questions to one I'm hoping will answer these 
 My name is Shizzy VI with the DB6 News 
 Dan Bull 
 And I'm Dan Bull, here to discuss the issues 
 Shizzy VI 
 Okay, it seems recently America caused a blunder 
 Fallen under, suffered, the reason why is what we all have wondered 
 Dan Bull 
 Capitol Hill were meant to passing a bill 
 About how America was splashing its mils, but they were lacking the skill 
 Lagging until it was too late and shut down 
 Shizzy VI 
 But now that it's shutdown and sundown Dan, what now? 
 Dan Bull 
 Well, first an urgent purge of federal workers 
 Essential ones will stay, the rest will be worthless 
 Shizzy VI 
 Along with being worthless, with hungry mouths and stress 
 Do you have any idea how many people it'll affect? 
 Dan Bull 
 Well, 800,000 are not deemed essential 
 So their diaries are gonna be really uneventful 
 Shizzy VI 
 The eventual tears will be a lot to see 
 What exactly will this do the economy? 
 Dan Bull 
 We will see a drop in stocks and profits immediately 
 The longer it goes on, the more it eats into the GDP 
 Shizzy VI 
 Dropping quick as DDT, I can't help but feel choked up 
 Dan, since you're in the office, care to explain what's the hold up? 
 Dan Bull 
 Yeah, of course 
 The Democrats are in a never-ending spat 
 With the Republicans on just how to spend their tax 
 Shizzy VI 
 And because of that, we can't relax, there's drama here 
 Care to tell me what that has to do with Obamacare? 
 Dan Bull 
 Well, some Republicans believe that social healthcare 
 Is so bad for welfare, they're ready to go out there 
 This is nail-biting stuff for Obama's cuticles 
 And equally key play for major pharmaceuticals 
 Shizzy VI 
 Seems for some of these guys, being in office is unsuitable 
 I'd rather see them clean cars and never see a cubicle! 
 I'm sorry, I'm just enraged and took a slight detour 
 Now my next question is: has this happened before? 
 Dan Bull 
 The last shutdown was nearly 20 years ago, lasting 21 days 
 So this appears to show that it could take a serious amount of time 
 To resolve what's a fuss about a dime 
 Shizzy VI 
 Which is a shame, it's like a game 
 With our funds is being played 
 But during the whole fiasco, does the President get paid? 
 Dan Bull 
 Yep 
 The President's still getting sent a paycheck 
 With everyone in Congress, it's a safe bet 
 Shizzy VI 
 At this point, I just feel that America neglects me 
 But just to be sure, how does this whole thing affect me? 
 Dan Bull 
 Well, in many ways you won't be left on your own 
 But won't be able to get a passport or federal loan 
 But despite the changes that we're sure to see 
 It won't affect national or social security 
 Shizzy VI 
 Well, I suppose that's a positive, diminishing the shame 
 But the biggest question here is: 
 Who are we to blame? 
 Dan Bull 
 Yeah, who's responsible for digging this hole? 
 Well, opinion polls suggest them in control of Congress 
 While about 10% less blame the President for getting us into the bloody mess 
 Shizzy VI 
 Well Dan, I appreciate you taking out the time 
 To elighten us here at DB6 at five, now 
 We wait to see if we're out of luck now 
 Or if power returns to the system to end this... 
 Shutdown
