It's been said that the first casualty of war is truth, And I'm inclined to agree. Listen: 
 We live in an age of instant information 
 So isn't it strange that things have been hidden away from us 
 Governments think we need to gain their trust 
 But it's the other way around, just take a look 
 Nothing tells us more than raw data does 
 So it's important it's all available to us 
 Plus put up for debate 
 And looked at by the public's gaze 
 Because there's a lot more to be gained from taking off the ball and the chain 
 And the blinkers that have been causing us pain in more than one way 
 Power to the people? We've fallen away from it 
 There's a formal name for this, it's called a dictatorship 
 And censorship's not restoring our faith for shit 
 So let's rip away the red tape and paperclips 
 It's a shame that it's come to this for freedom of speech 
 That we need a safe haven for people that leak 
 But you see, we speak what we seek 
 And we just seek what we speak, and that's the truth that's keeping us free 
 The truth will set you free 
 The truth will set you free 
 The issue's prickly when it comes to WikiLeaks 
 Different people see it differently and disagree 
 Does it pillory the bigotry of ministries of tyranny 
 Or is it merely hindering the coalition's victory? 
 It's a mystery to me, but look at history 
 You'll see that liberty is eager to face up to inquiry 
 We learnt a heap from Bradley Manning, didn't we? 
 We saw conspiracy hidden beneath the sheet of anonymity 
 This military intelligence is giving me the evidence 
 We really need to step up and declare that we're fed up of it 
 Why should we trust you when everything that does come through 
 Shows we shouldn't trust you as far as we could chuck you 
 Try to silence something, it'll become amplified 
 Magnified by wires, waves and satellite 
 We won't be pacified by the fact it's classified 
 You need a mandate from the people to be ratified 
 So on their behalf I shall provide this battle cry 
 To tell the powers that be that we're clearly unsatisfied 
 And if you ignore my reasonable plea 
 That's just fine by me, 'cause all the media's seen 
 The cause and reason for leaks is more than freedom of speech 
 It's also people's belief that we all need to be briefed 
 In order to keep all the peace, we ought to police the police 
 And that takes much more than just the formal PR release 
 So all in all you see, we speak what we seek 
 And we just seek what we speak, it's the truth that's keeping us free 
 The truth will set you free 
 The truth will set you free 
 Should we listen to the whistleblowers? Of course 
 Even if it'll throw us off course? 
 Of course, 'cause if you need to suppress the truth 
 Then I expect that you've got some regretful news 
 But it's best that you confess and soon 
 Before we end up less than destitute 
 Civilian deaths and executions are routine 
 While billions are spent on weapon producing 
 Do you think you can reduce the terror threat 
 By inflicting terror on an infant that's never witnessed terror yet 
 Look, if Americans had taken my parents away 
 I'd never forget my vendetta till I'd settled the debt 
 It'd take more than an open letter to let you know 
 That what we see's obviously not democracy, it's puppetry 
 This jungle's burning and we can't see the wood for trees 
 Sky's keeping us dry, so we need someone to leak 
 Because you see, we speak what we seek 
 And we just seek what we speak, it's the truth that's keeping us free 
 The truth will set you free 
 The truth will set you free 
 Thanks to WikiLeaks - one of the most important websites ever, and thanks to everyone who's put their personal safety on the line in order to expose something that they feel needs to be known. The truth will set you free.
