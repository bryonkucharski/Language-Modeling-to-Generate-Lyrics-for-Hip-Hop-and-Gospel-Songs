I'm a dastardly master thief 
 The chance of you actually catching me 
 Is but minimal, I've maximum mastery 
 Mastered each of my skills to the max, you see 
 That's the key, I treat combat as last and least 
 Because I vastly prefer sneaking past with ease 
 But if I have to, I'll attack from the back, crack 
 Snatch your key and stash that in my knapsack 
 This isn't the way the planet has to be 
 Handcrafted skills killed by factories 
 Fat cats are treating talent nastily 
 Somebody has to redress the balance and it's me 
 I'm a thief, a man upon a mission 
 I'm a shadow in the corner of your vision 
 Taking all your things with no need for permission 
 I'm a man upon a mission, I'm a thief 
 I'm a thief, a man upon a mission 
 I'm a shadow in the corner of your vision 
 Taking all your things with no need for permission 
 I'm a man upon a mission, I'm a thief 
 Freedom lies where I hide in the shadows 
 I desire to strike into the light, like the flight of an arrow 
 I creep through the narrow streets 
 And the breeze sends a shiver through my marrow, see 
 I haven't much left in the war chest 
 So I best make a quick trip, visit Baron Northcrest 
 There's a right tyrant, so I might have to end my silence 
 And get a mite violent, 'cause if I don't 
 Then Orion'll be vying for a fight 
 And his style and aggressiveness 
 In Rhetoric are quite diametrical to mine 
 He'd rather break a window 
 I tend to pull the blinds 
 I'm a thief, a man upon a mission 
 I'm a shadow in the corner of your vision 
 Taking all your things with no need for permission 
 I'm a man upon a mission, I'm a thief 
 I lived in a realm that I doubt was jocund 
 But this new town's nought but rotten 
 Greed and disease and the sound of coughing 
 Drowned out by the crown in the House of Blossoms 
 We could recrown it in the House of Sodom 
 There's a sea of people out need help but sod them 
 Leave it long enough it'll be no doubt forgotten 
 Like the time Xiao Xiao said, "I felt her bottom" 
 I hear the tick tock of the tower clock and 
 It means I better nip off out for shopping 
 Prowl atop inns, the crippled burrick pub 
 Down I drop into the city that I love 
 The pinnacle of criminals; I slip in from above 
 A night owl with the philosophic mission of a dove 
 When there's no one left to police the streets 
 And keep the peace, you best leave it to me 
 The thief, peace 
 I'm a thief, a man upon a mission 
 I'm a shadow in the corner of your vision 
 Taking all your things with no need for permission 
 I'm a man upon a mission, I'm a thief 
 I'm a thief, a man upon a mission 
 I'm a shadow in the corner of your vision 
 Taking all your things with no need for permission 
 I'm a man upon a mission, I'm a thief
