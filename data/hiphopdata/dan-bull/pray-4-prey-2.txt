Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to pay our last respects 
 To our dear departed brother 
 We mourn his passing for he was a good man 
 I'm Killian Samuels, I used to be a US Marshal 
 Tracking down fugitives with the newest arsenal 
 Up till my passenger plane lost a couple of nuts and bolts and crashed 
 This hole's a bit of a culture clash but don't let it hold you back 
 Now I'm a bounty hunter, rounding up chumps for a lump sum 
 Hunting pond scum amongst the clutter and junk, who wants some? 
 You'll need a strong stomach, this is not for the easily queasy 
 If you want something easy peasy, you're in the wrong street, believe me 
 Try to flee from me, you'll see the reason people fear me 
 Friends are few and far between so foes, I keep them near me 
 I'm getting closer and closer, so I hope you hear me clearly 
 Still on your toes believing you can deceive and beat me, really? 
 Every day I'm facing death and a plethora of bigger threats 
 But I hate to say that I may be facing my biggest yet 
 My game development's been dropped and stubbed out like a cigarette 
 In an executive decision that may be gamer's biggest regret 
 Listen Bethesda, the first Prey was a great game, shame on you 
 I pray that you make Prey 2 or I may prey on you 
 I don't know what happened behind the scenes to make it fall through 
 But I'm asking Pete Hines to please try to pull through 
 I'll buy the thing twice, even thrice if I need to 
 Just give the franchise the fans like so dear a reboot 
 I'll buy the thing twice, even thrice if I need to 
 I pray that you make Prey 2 or I may prey on you 
 Ha, no one's better than me 
 I rap for games that exist hypothetically
