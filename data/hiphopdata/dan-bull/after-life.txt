When you're old and run down, what happens when you die? 
 Not your soul but the dust and the ashes and the like 
 After that time you've passed on and they're scattered and they lie 
 Under the grass in a casket for time 
 Until the last of your atoms has gone back to the matter 
 That it had been a part of when the planet was gas dust 
 At the instant you're officially a corpse 
 This list of sick things begins kicking in with force 
 The tempature of your body's inner core falls 
 And this event is called algor mortis 
 It's thought this happens 'cause your pulse has flattened 
 So it halts the passage of the warmth and that 
 But if you thought that that was a nauseous fact 
 Then I ought to inform you what also happens 
 The muscles in your ass pack up and relax 
 So that all of that crap just stacks up in your pants 
 Your blood runs back under the gravitational pull 
 Then thickens and begins to coagulate plus 
 Skin pallid, limbs all stiff 
 This is called rigor mortis 
 When you die 
 Don't even bother thinking about floating to heaven 
 When you die 
 You won't burn in hell but you might roast in an oven 
 When you die 
 Don't even bother thinking of eternal paradise 
 When you die 
 You'll just be fertilising grass in this so-called afterlife 
 After twenty-four hours or so 
 You actually eventually swell up and bloat 
 The gases inside you can't come out so they only 
 Keep amassing till you're either really fat or explode 
 But don't laugh, 'cause I mean it, that isn't a joke 
 It'll happen to the Queen and the average bloke 
 Bacteria starts devouring both 
 Flesh and fat from your anatomy, out of your clothes 
 Then it's down to the crows to come down and carry on 
 Lunch out on carrion down to the bone 
 Now you should know that even bones decompose 
 If you leave them over an aeon or so 
 There will be no trace of your dead corpse 
 You'll be feeding potatoes and absorbed 
 Dug up and eaten off a plate with salad raw 
 I'm sorry to say I'm afraid that's the law 
 Actions have reactions so it has to stop 
 Every man since Adam's travelled back to the cosmos 
 Rock to iron to steel and back to rust 
 Ash to ash and dust to dust 
 Ashes to ashes 
 And dust to dust 
 Ashes to ashes 
 And dust to dust 
 When you die 
 Don't even bother thinking about floating to heaven 
 When you die 
 You won't burn in hell but you might roast in an oven 
 When you die 
 Don't even bother thinking of eternal paradise 
 When you die 
 You'll just be fertilising grass in this so-called afterlife
