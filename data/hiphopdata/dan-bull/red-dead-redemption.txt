Fresh for 1911, you suckas 
 Listen, I got a story to tell 
 His name was John Marston, a hard 'un, former outlaw 
 Taken by the FBI, so what they let him out for? 
 They wanted him to scout where his old gang hanged 
 And help them to see that his old gang hanged 
 They were a rag tag band ravaging the badlands 
 There was only one way that this'd end: bang bang 
 Found Bill Williamson at Fort Mercer 
 Met the wrong end of his gun, could call it murder 
 But Marston was found, dying parched on the ground 
 By the bonniest farmer around: Bonnie MacFarlane and now 
 John in his honour did odd jobs with her father and helped 
 Looped lassos lobbed and fires put out 
 Riding the finest mount, got to explore 
 Living the life that he liked in the great outdoors 
 Ambushing, hunting, trapping, interrupting public hangings 
 Such a bunch of random encounters and misunderstandings 
 But I'm not done with rambling and John's not done with gambling 
 Dueling, looking out for bounties, pulling plants and fully handling 
 Any damn business this district could imagine witnessing 
 Hanging with Dickens, Harold, Landon Ricketts 
 Attacking antagonists from henchmen to the head, the boss 
 From van der Linde, Allende to Edgar Ross 
 Enter Dead Eye, whereby time kinda stops 
 Then many enemies get shot, a lot 
 Guns cocked and locked, one shot could stop an ox 
 Options? Not a lot; they've got to drop 
 'Cause they're chock a block with bullet holes like dot to dot 
 Those watching are like, "What the fock?" 
 Got their attention, that's audience retention 
 Enemies left red and dead: redemption 
 Got your attention, that's audience retention 
 Enemies left red and dead: redemption
