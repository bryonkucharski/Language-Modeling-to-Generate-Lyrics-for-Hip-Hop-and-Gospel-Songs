Open your little door 
 Step out into the downpour 
 Listen to the sound your 
 Listen to the sound your soul makes 
 As if it's soulmates 
 With the ground 
 The rain falls down 
 The ground 
 The rain falls down 
 To the floor 
 The summer rain has come again 
 The pavement sizzles like drizzling lemonade 
 Oh, and the sunlight seems unlikely 
 To be on my cheeks for one fine evening 
 There's nobody else around 
 Absence has a powerful sound 
 Blades of grass are fine enough to make a scalpel proud 
 Alka-Seltzer sizzle drizzle pelts the ground 
 I can't help myself but shout aloud 
 To tell the crowd 
 That while they're out, I'm out of bounds 
 I could flee till my knees hurt 
 Feel the breeze in my t-shirt 
 But there's so many aesthetically pleasing things here to see first 
 The summer rain has come again 
 The pavement sizzles like drizzling lemonade 
 Oh, and the sunlight seems unlikely 
 To be on my cheeks for one fine evening 
 Flowers bob, nod and rattle 
 Under fat drops of rain big as apples 
 And the street steams like a kettle, singing 
 Each bead a little a nettle, stinging 
 My skin in a million different places 
 Precipitation amidst the vegetation 
 The British air is changing 
 And sitting under parked cars there are kitties waiting 
 Watching me pace by 
 I stop and then say hi 
 The summer rain has come again 
 The pavement sizzles like drizzling lemonade 
 Oh, and the sunlight seems unlikely 
 To be on my cheeks for one fine evening 
 Could never sing, but I sang though; Dionysus 
 Air rang with the tang of a mango; delicious 
 Living in a fictitious middle English mangrove, that's been kissed 
 With the liquid sunshine that some find in Orlando 
 I hang under the jungle canopy 
 Catching an undiluted glimpse of clarity 
 Refracting through the prism imprisoning my sanity 
 For all the laws we're living in anarchy 
 Causing wars, it's giving me anomy 
 The rows of windows are frames inside a strange gallery 
 Of apathy 
 Inhabitants happily having tea 
 Warm water colours reality 
 Washes away the banality 
 The summer rain has come again 
 The pavement sizzles like drizzling lemonade 
 Oh, and the sunlight seems unlikely 
 To be on my cheeks for one fine evening 
 My hair is getting wetter 
 The air is getting fresher 
 Before the storm I'm sure I could barely bear the pressure out 
 But it's getting better now 
 It was one of those horribly hot days 
 The barometer's ominous clock face 
 Was something Hieronymus Bosch paints 
 From Shropshire to Gloucester to Warwickshire 
 Forests of conifers congregate like choristers 
 And praise displays of flowers as a florist does 
 Knowledge buds and blooms in the soil 
 Olives crushed producing an oil 
 To lubricate the mind 
 Illuminate and shine 
 A human ray of light 
 Right through the rain tonight 
 It just might quite save a life 
 The summer rain has come again 
 The pavement sizzles like drizzling lemonade 
 Oh, and the sunlight seems unlikely 
 To be on my cheeks for one fine evening
