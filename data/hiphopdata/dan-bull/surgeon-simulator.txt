Hi, I'm Nigel Burke 
 You might know me as the guy that lurks 
 In the hospital pulling back the final curtains 
 As saving lives is my line of work 
 I'm overworked and I'm overpaid 
 Nobody else gets home as late 
 No time to poo, no time to wee 
 To go on a date, no time to sleep, see 
 But regardless, of what they're paying me 
 I'm the hardest, in the A&E 
 A couple of whiskies, a couple of baileys 
 I'm ready for my shift; give me the blade, please 
 This is an emergency surgery, third degree burns 
 Leave the patient waiting in purgatory, operating with urgency 
 We can't take an eternity, blood loss rate is discernibly 
 Worse than the state of my purse on my Lace Anniversary, unlucky 
 That's why I stay here so late just to earn a fee 
 That's why the patient is late, toe-tagged and lay on a slate in this infirmary 
 Yeah, I may have made a mistake, there may be stains on my apron 
 But baby, hey, I'm just saying that when the table is shaking 
 In the back of an ambulance 
 It's a little difficult to keep on track what your hands are doing 
 Oh golly, when you're on a trolley 
 Trying to find the right tool's like Where's Wally 
 If I was you I'd be crying for my mommy 
 I'd give you a tissue, but I've not got one on me 
 Sorry, I'm a little unprepared 
 But luckily you're not in a position to be running scared 
 Caught you unawares, anaesthetised 
 Now you're asleep, give me your teeth and eyes 
 What are you worried about? Who's scary? 
 I'm just the new tooth fairy 
 I'm coming for your calcium 
 Like a loon let loose in the dairy 
 When I said I'm not a dentist what I meant is 
 Of all my skills, it's just a percentage 
 My qualifications might be invented 
 But I won't get better without trying to attempt it 
 Dentally demented, I tend to need apprentices 
 Because it's them that seem to comprehend more than me 
 I generally pretend it, and so far I've never been suspended 
 In theatre, I'm territorial, less surgical, more gladiatorial 
 If this gets any more gory I'll put it on YouTube as a tutorial 
 I've been awake on call for days 
 My eyes are red as when I went to Ultralase 
 Not a qualified eye surgeon 
 But I can't help but help when you're eye's hurting 
 See, I'm a nice person, Chris Martin 
 I'll try to fix you; quick, stick a heart in! 
 Enough blarting, we've hit an artery 
 Made a chest cavity big enough to park in 
 Demographically setting a precedent 
 Increasing the speed that you'll get an inheritance 
 I never get done for medical negligence 
 Not because I'm good, but 'cause I bury the evidence 
 Demographically setting a precedent 
 Increasing the speed that you'll get an inheritance 
 I never get done for medical negligence 
 Not because I'm good, but 'cause I bury the evidence 
 Chop chop 
 You're life in my hands
