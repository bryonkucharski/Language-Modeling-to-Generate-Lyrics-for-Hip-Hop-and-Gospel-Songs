Tell me - do you believe in fate? 
 Do you believe that we each have a fee to pay 
 And a leaving date with no hope to deviate 
 That our breathing rate ceases when we reach this age? 
 Where do we go when we leave this place? 
 Is it nowhere where nobody can see your face? 
 There's no need to kneel on your knees and pray 
 'Cause seasons change so it may be today 
 Looking back on the one life I've had on this Earth 
 This planet, this world, I sit back and I ponder 
 I have become fond of the fact I've lasted this long 
 Though in the past I've done wrong and my battery's gone 
 Will things be any different here after I'm gone? 
 Will anybody listen to my tracks or my songs? 
 You're asking the wrong chap I know as much as you 
 So I'm just confusing matters but it has to be done 
 It's a factor in all the planet's mass populace 
 That we're asking for knowledge but lack what we want 
 There's certain facts that we won't actually know 
 We lack the composure to relax and just focus on absolute calm 
 And that can do harm so we have to succumb 
 To the fact that after we're gone we're transmitted back to the cosmos 
 And after the storm the pattern goes on 
 So you have to be strong, 'cause that's where you belong 
 But I want you to see what it's like to be me 
 And I want you to remember me 
 I want to be remembered when I enter into heaven 
 The day I die then greater than September the eleventh 
 But then again when in the history of men 
 Has there ever been an event that we never will forget 
 Eventually everything tends to irrelevance 
 Till we're left with an ebb that can never be filled 
 Everything built inevitably will 
 Descend into a stillness until the end of the world 
 Seasons will change 
 Empires will fall 
 Don't panic, our planet's to vanish 
 You've had a few chances and now it is happening 
 Man, he has managed to damage the planet 
 So bad that it cannot be fixed 
 But the bigger the bomb, the quicker we're gone 
 So I quicken my rhythm and finish the song 
 I sit in the dark and picture a part 
 Of my heart but it's hard 'cause I ripped it apart 
 Split into half with all of our smarts 
 Sick of the starkness but I can't start 
 On a mission to start building an ark 
 Filled with the spark of a star that is dear to my heart 
 And here I depart
