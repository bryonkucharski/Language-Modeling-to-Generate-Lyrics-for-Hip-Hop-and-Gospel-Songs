See me? 
 I stepped straight off the rugby pitch 
 Pierced my cauliflower ears 
 With the ugly stick 
 Fed up of scrummages 
 Where funny kids would hug me quick 
 I thought "I need a new sport" 
 Then it suddenly clicked 
 I'd jump ship 
 As soon as I could find a good port 
 Head to the States 
 And get a taste of college football 
 I'm standin' out 
 I make a talent scout say 
 "Hang about! 
 This is the man 
 That we've been tryin' to hatch a plan without?" 
 A British rugger lover 
 Over on shore leave 
 The kid's a lucky bugger 
 My clover's four-leafed 
 So don't ignore me 
 I'm on the road to glory 
 Rollin' over rows of foes 
 Like a coach and horsies 
 If only I was coachin' your team 
 Raw meat, I throw the ball deep 
 Into enemy territory 
 Takin' on all teams 
 The very best from each college 
 I'll tackle them so hard 
 They'll never eat solids 
 Demolish your defence 
 Leave them in the deep end 
 It's D-Day 
 The invasion of D-A-N 
 Check those credentials 
 Pro potential 
 My flow's torrential 
 So whatever you throw in my direction 
 Is inconsequential 
 Techniques are confidential 
 You wanna step to me? 
 Please, come on, be sensible 
 Petty fools 
 Try to knock me off my pedestal 
 Like the heavy fall 
 You're inevitably headed for 
 Reignin' forever 
 So you better head indoors 
 My whole rhyme's a goldmine 
 Fetch the Seven Dwarves 
 "Good heavens, Lord 
 What else do you have in store?" 
 I got it locked 
 Knock knockin' up on heaven's door 
 This is the situation 
 A British pitch invasion 
 Bringin' everythin' except the kitchen sink 
 Sorry, "kitchen basin" 
 And this is just the initiation 
 Of the Brit invasion 
 A bit of vindication 
 For the fact I never had an invitation 
 Still reignin' forever 
 Precipitation 
 A little bit of titillation
