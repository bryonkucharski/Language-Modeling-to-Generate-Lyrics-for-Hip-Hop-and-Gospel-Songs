Hey, look 
 The Glade of Dreams is in danger, my friend, so 
 Wake your mates, preparate for adventure 
 The tension and the suspense is getting immense 
 A set of events that doesn't make any sense 
 Enter the dream team, we've got the teensies 
 A little blue big nosed load of wee beings 
 Then we've got Globox, my best chum 
 Whose refreshingest of beverages is a cup of plum juice 
 Barbara the Aryan Barbarian 
 There is barely a woman wearing fierier hair 
 And then there is nobody on Earth who so rarely 
 Frowns as infrequently as Murfy the Fairy 
 And now for the star of the show me, Rayman 
 Slightly insane, man, I might need a brain scan 
 Hey man, ha, hoo, it's Rayman, ho, ha 
 Hooray, man, ha, hoo, it's Rayman, ho, ha 
 The Bubble Dreamer is deep asleep and he seems to be 
 Struggling with a heap of trouble in his dreams and this means 
 For us that there is going to be the meanest of repercussions 
 Just look at these stacks of paintings, they're captivating 
 We took a little peek and they snapped us straight in 
 Racing all over the world with my good chums 
 Taking out all the horrid little hoodlums 
 I hope you've got good thumb reflexes 
 To get enough good lums to afford a Lexus 
 It'll cost you an arm and a leg 
 Till you're looking like me, just some garms and a head 
 But I don't consider it a disability 
 Having no limbs gives ridiculous agility 
 Hey man, ha, hoo, it's Rayman, ho, ha 
 Hooray, man, ha, hoo, it's Rayman, ho, ha, hee 
 I'm an acrobatic combatant compatible with rapping 
 Because my reactions are faster than actual magic is 
 A manic man with detachable hands and his gang 
 That's all that stands up to battle these anarchists 
 Running around, I jump on the ground 
 Up and then down, look what I found 
 Strumming it loud in front of a crowd 
 A wonderful sound 
 Hey man, ha, hoo, it's Rayman, ho, ha 
 Hooray, man, ha, hoo, it's Rayman, ho, ha, hee 
 My name's Rayman and I'm the main man 
 My name's Rayman and I'm the main man 
 My name's Rayman and I'm the main man 
 My name's Rayman and I'm the main man 
 Hey, man, ha
