This is, this is an introduction 
 Oi, my name is Daniel Recker, join my game, and Dan'll wreck ya 
 Do me a nice favour, get out of my face or I might take a whole skyscraper 
 And even more later maybe three to four acres 
 Plus every map from Paracel Storm, Resort to Dawnbreaker 
 Sneak into my Flood Zone, you're cover's soon blown 
 I'll turn your dog tag into a little tombstone 
 Is this a revolutionary game or just a new clone? 
 Who knows? Judging by the sales figures, you don't 
 Man, I could stand here and shoot for hours 
 Till I've taken out everyone of the three global superpowers 
 A vision of the future, 20/20, my vision's super duper, 20/20 
 I'm equipped with many shooters, plenty, plenty 
 Big Bang, Sheldon Cooper, Penny, Penny 
 Battlefield 4, Battlefield 4 
 The best Battlefield since the Battlefield before 
 Battlefield 4, Battlefield 4 
 Is it Battlefield 3? No, it's Battlefield 4 
 Battlefield 4, Battlefield 4 
 The best Battlefield since the Battlefield before 
 Battlefield 4, Battlefield 4 
 Is it Battlefield 3? No, it's Battlefield 4 
 You know Dan's mission is make a Rogue Transmission 
 Set the dial on your radio and listen 
 What happens when you open a platinum battle pack? 
 You get a single track CD; this battle rap 
 You're the PC to my Apple Mac 
 Fundamentally opposed, so get out my habitat 
 I'll blast mags, even more than Jackfrags 
 Point at all the things with the same finger with which I snatch tags 
 It doesn't matter what I see these fools toting 
 I just double it up, dual scoping 
 One for each of your prepubecent balls, grow some 
 School's open, and I leave every rule broken 
 Battlefield 4, Battlefield 4 
 The best Battlefield since the Battlefield before 
 Battlefield 4, Battlefield 4 
 Is it Battlefield 3? No, it's Battlefield 4 
 Battlefield 4, Battlefield 4 
 The best Battlefield since the Battlefield before 
 Battlefield 4, Battlefield 4 
 Is it Battlefield 3? No, it's Battlefield 4 
 I've got a bull's head, I think I'm a Minotaur 
 I shot you fools dead, extinct, like a dinosaur 
 Look at you crying now, what you whining for? 
 You can either leave through the window or by the door 
 There's a pile of corpses by your fortress 
 Who left that there? Well, I'd have thought it was me 
 'Cause I'm the type to counter-knife y'all 
 Wipe the blood off my brow and say, "Wow, how delightful" 
 A knife in a gunfight, this is how it's done, right? 
 If I didn't give you a chance, it'd be unpolite 
 There's panic in the streets, Humberside 
 You are not safe here, Honey Pie 
 Ask Bonnie Tyler what I did to her heart 
 I more than eclipsed it, I ripped it apart 
 I'd rather play Battlefield than with her tits and her arse 
 Regarding military ditties, I turned it to an art 
 Listen 
 Battlefield 4, Battlefield 4 
 The best Battlefield since the Battlefield before
