Dawn 
 An ancient evil awakens 
 The galaxy's here for the takin' 
 We need more than police and a spaceship 
 To cease the Prometheans claimin' it (Yeah) 
 These evil assailants 
 Are leavin' the deepest abrasions 
 Without delimitations 
 Now Master Chief has been catching Z's 
 Since he last was seen on these screens 
 Now he's back and eager 
 To blast a piece 
 At the catastrophe that he sees 
 We 
 Thought the Forerunners had all done a runner 
 But the Covenant are currently ballin' like none other 
 Bummer 
 But somethin' doesn't add up there's another species and 
 They're bringin' beastly guns 
 The scattershot'll splat a lot of meaty chunks 
 So you better be backing off from the Prometheans, son 
 Far more than a Martian war 
 This calls for the Spartan-IV 
 No other corps is coming half as raw 
 Or packing such a frackin' massive arsenal 
 Cortana calls, who's she askin' for? 
 It's the MC MC styles galore 
 In a time of war 
 I'm the one-man remedy and I am called John-117 
 Back bigger than ever quicker and cleverer 
 Getting rid of the mess as if I'm an enema 
 I am bigger than Machinima 
 Or an IMAX image in a cinema 
 Though my enemies take no prisoners 
 I still escape fate like a space John Dillinger 
 Look, you prat these are just the facts 
 Me, I'm risin' skyward, thruster pack 
 And I'm rhymin; tight never cut you slack 
 Your head's just another nut to crack 
 And when it comes to nuts 
 I stuffed a sack with cojones galore 
 Enough to catch me a trophy of war, Custer's hat, so if you need a battle rap 
 This is just the track 
 Brap 
 Lyrically killin' the audience 
 As if I'm bringin' an Infinity ordnance 
 Then I rewind the track, respawn the chumps just to remind the fact Chief's awesomeness 
 I brought dreadful news 
 You're shot to bits 
 Dead, you lose 
 Lost, adrift 
 Reds and Blues not Bloods and Crips 
 So I hopped in my Warthog and crushed your whip 
 Pushed a clip into my rifle 
 Givin' you an eyeful of ammunition damagin' your vision man, I'm spiteful! 
 The rightful heir to the UNSC, I declare I'm too sexy! 
 When I say "Ho" you say " Yes, chief?" 
 I put the "I" in "chef" and I'm prepping up a recipe 
 Forget Reach, leave ODST 
 And go Forward unto Dawn you get me? 
 I should compose me a requiem theme 
 Nobody'd forget me then, we've 
 Re-entered the end of the rainbow, storm warning! 
 Tornado 
 So you better lay low because I say so 
 And wait for the payload, Halo! 
 Pay no dividends, take no prisoners 
 No matter how cray things go no giving up 
 I am bigger than Machinima 
 Or an IMAX image in a cinema 
 Though my enemies take no prisoners 
 I still escape fate like a space John Dillinger 
 If you're an alien or a being upon Earth 
 I'll battle you on any beat and leave you looking worse 
 If you're rapping to Infinity 
 I'll even push it further
