It's The Mightiest Quest, are you ready for the test? 
 Going face to face with the best of the best 
 In the Mightiest Quest, are you ready for the test? 
 Based on your base, well I never would have guessed 
 Look, I was never a chap to simply select between defend and attack 
 So if anyone asks for trouble, I'm going to be doubly sending them back 
 The throne is mine, I'm ending any pretender to that 
 I'm sensing a lack of courage such that you won't even reach the end of the track 
 I've been training at dawn, every day to be ready for the Great Big Battle 
 Evading traps all day while I'm raiding castles 
 And I'm aiming at fools with such deviousness 
 That it's even leaving mages baffled 
 Debasers, Crabs or gelatinous walls, I'm hacking them all 
 Jabbing and brawling, having a ball 
 And sending them packing their bags in the hall 
 If Humpty Dumpty had a great fall 
 Then I probably hit him 
 It's The Mightiest Quest, are you ready for the test? 
 Going face to face with the best of the best 
 In the Mightiest Quest, are you ready for the test? 
 Based on your base, well I never would have guessed 
 (Pay attention!) 
 I'm raiding your mates, and taking everything that they bought 
 I fought them in their forts, blood sport's the way it's paid for 
 And I'm a great sport, wielding a greatsword 
 Treat your face like I'm walloping a baseball 
 I drop the Painhammer, like my surname 
 And I certainly know to make the most of my fame 
 Man, I treat merchandising opportunities as prudently 
 As a morbidly obese Beastman would treat the food he eats 
 I'm a greedy bugger, me and my money, we need each other 
 I'm bringing enough bling to sting the vision of Stevie Wonder 
 I'm applying oceans, of potions like lotion 
 Till I'm not even trying, I'm just going through the motions 
 It's The Mightiest Quest, are you ready for the test? 
 Going face to face with the best of the best 
 In the Mightiest Quest, are you ready for the test? 
 Based on your base, well I never would have guessed 
 The sight of my castle's really something in the sky 
 Your is as useless as a Cyclops with something in its eye 
 And in particular, a chicken as vicious as this is ridiculous 
 I think an efficient and fitting prescription is if we could give them barbiturates 
 I'm clad in heavy armour, you're dressed like a belly dancer 
 Your smelly archers made me catch my breath, Kelly Clarkson 
 I lunge a lot at Hungerbots and snotty Snottinghams 
 And any funds they drop, well I'll probably pocket them 
 I poke my sword at the Terroraptor Overlord 
 Quick, grab the stash, and throw ourselves overboard 
 It's the only life I know, it's how I do things 
 In Opulencia you get rich or die looting 
 It's The Mightiest Quest, are you ready for the test? 
 Going face to face with the best of the best 
 In the Mightiest Quest, are you ready for the test? 
 Based on your base, well I never would have guessed 
 It's The Mightiest Quest, are you ready for the test? 
 Going face to face with the best of the best 
 In the Mightiest Quest, are you ready for the test? 
 Based on your base, well I never would have guessed 
 Egads, it just keeps getting better
