It's the dawn of the Second Era, war is getting nearer 
 Former enemies get together, form a better, clearer 
 Bigger force of Bretons, Orcs and Redguards 
 To fill hearts with dread and leave seas of heads scarred 
 The Bretons are the Westerners that trek the depth and breadth 
 Of Tamriel through Hammerfell till we have dealt with every pestilence 
 In essence, Bretons are the sages of the lessons in the pages 
 Of the Ancient Books, the weapons of the mages 
 Respected through the ages as professional and gracious 
 Due to dressing in the raiments of the excellentest tailors 
 The Gift of Magnus give us bags of extra Magicka 
 So many spells you'd have a hella job to add it up 
 We swear fealty to High King Emeric 
 And anybody that doesn't is going to get a haemorrhage 
 So pour a beverage, and hold it up high 
 Promise to serve the Covenant even if we must die 
 No other government is running us; we're warriors 
 They cannot worry us; we do not know what worry is 
 From the humblest man to the baddest lord 
 Raise our hands up with the flags and let the dagger fall 
 Let the dagger fall, let the dagger fall 
 Deep and true and you can have it all 
 Let the dagger fall, let the dagger fall 
 True and deep and we can have it all 
 We are the Orsimer, nobody's awesomer 
 War's in our blood, while yours never poured thinner 
 Spilling warm innards on the floor in a small inn 
 And eat poor little paupers up, for dinner 
 Pick up the porter and pour in some more liquor 
 Raw ichor, getting slaughtered'll leave you 
 All with a little bit more than a sore liver 
 You've no more hope than a small glimmer 
 Your Lord's never ever going to forgive us 
 Whether lawgivers or sinners 
 We are warring for a cause and we fought it with the force 
 Of a horse with the balls of a pure winner 
 Blacksmiths, axes, add it to the axis 
 Of actual madness you're going to get whacked with 
 From the humblest man to the Dragonborn 
 Raise our hands up with the flags and let the dagger fall 
 Let the dagger fall, let the dagger fall 
 Deep and true and you can have it all 
 Let the dagger fall, let the dagger fall 
 True and deep and we can have it all 
 See the dagger fall after the hammer fell 
 Plan a parry and it is apparent that your plan'll fail 
 From Sentinel, our power's spanning all of Tamriel 
 In every race's annals, tales of our battles sail 
 Over moats and castles; vales, overdose on powerful ale 
 For we shall regale you with how we're tough as dragonscale 
 Then hit you right on the head like a hammered nail 
 Breathtaking so don't forget you can inhale 
 Stacked physiques, we're athletes in wrapped sheets 
 From a land of vast heat, our rap sheets 
 Are longer than an Abecean Anvil back street 
 Fact: we eat bread and the crust and thus we be incredibly buff 
 But it's never enough, we never let muscles or metal descend into rust 
 So anyone coming and messing with us is getting rebuffed, offended and cussed 
 Then we have push with the adrenaline rush 
 We leave our enemies crushed with every thrust 
 So you'd better be hushed lest you end up as dust 
 Forward for Daggerfall 
 Let the dagger fall, let the dagger fall 
 Deep and true and you can have it all 
 Let the dagger fall, let the dagger fall 
 True and deep and we can have it all 
 Let the dagger fall, let the dagger fall 
 Deep and true and you can have it all 
 Let the dagger fall, let the dagger fall 
 True and deep and we can have it all
