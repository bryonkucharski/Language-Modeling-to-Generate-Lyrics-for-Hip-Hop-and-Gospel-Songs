At eight or ten I wondered why my voice wasn't breaking yet 
 I was impatient to get from A to Z 
 So I'd break a sweat, play cassettes in my tape deck 
 Waiting for the day I could step to a stage 
 And get paid respect, paid a cheque 
 Maybe the other kids would even play with me then 
 It's great to pretend the tune was written for you 
 That's why you sing with the radio while it ignores you 
 You perform awful but feel a lot better 
 "Boom Boom Boom", "Here Comes the Hotstepper" 
 Even back then my preference was funky 
 But less funky house than House in the Country 
 Syncopation, soul, anybody ill with it 
 Other kids had Whigfield, I was feeling Bill Withers 
 And to this day I'm still with him 
 Because nothing beats a sweet voice on distilled rhythms 
 I'm digging up my roots for you 
 Cooking up a little tuneful food 
 Come to the garden for a barbecue 
 And chill with me 
 Before I even saw South Park on TV 
 I knew by heart the South Park CD 
 GTA: 1969 opened a life long affinity for Trojan 
 Return of Django, Skinhead Moonstomp 
 Music of Jamaican origin liberating my boom box 
 Too young for Appetite for Destruction 
 So The Offspring were my rock introduction 
 That was all I needed to be free 
 A CD with some power chords shredding like a power saw 
 "Fuck me, wow" I thought 
 How can plucked strings be this powerful? 
 But then I found another source of auditory debauchery 
 This naughty teen thought was sweet 
 I bought a CD by an Emine-MC 
 Called "Hi! My Name Is Slim Shady" 
 I played it in my hi-fi daily 
 It never seemed to cease to amaze me 
 He'd say some crazy things 
 That were great for a teenager that needed danger 
 I'd replay the lyrics amazed 
 At the way the images would flicker in my brain so vividly 
 An outsider, a country bumpkin 
 Sitting inside with the Outsidaz bumping 
 There's something about rhymes 
 Nothing else quite does as well, I love it 
 Cypress Hill: Live at the Fillmore 
 I'm not going to lie, that film was raw 
 Each rap I heard, each film I saw 
 Inspired me to build my skills some more 
 So I bought more CDs to imitate 
 Believe me, back in the day it was great 
 I'm digging up my roots for you 
 Set the mood and feel those soothing grooves 
 Come to the garden for a barbecue 
 And chill with me 
 I had piano lessons after every last school day 
 But my patience was thinner than an anorexic 
 I didn't want to play ballads anyway 
 I had a daydream of breakbeats and a pen and paper 
 So I said I'd make the make believe real 
 And make some real reel to reels like B-Real 
 But the magic's made on computers today 
 So I used Magix Music Maker 
 Read the instructions, learnt all the book 
 Taught myself big beats like Norman Cook 
 Always cooking up a new track 
 Though with no microphone I couldn't actually do rap 
 That was too bad, but it wasn't too bad 
 'Cause I'd already forgot and had a new fad 
 Threw away The Source, bought a new mag 
 Made new mates, talked in new slang 
 I was a punk rocker now, proper loud 
 Would you believe I grabbed any opportunity to fuck about? 
 But what about the music? I've gone and lost it now 
 So I grabbed a guitar and started rocking out 
 Made a band with my mates called MatronsApron 
 We played around, made some tapes it was great fun 
 Full of belly laughs 
 Even received a brief mention in the Telegraph 
 Just a couple of kids, played a couple of gigs 
 And then my mates moved on but fuck if I did 
 Obviously too late, got a copy of Cubase 
 A lot of tunes made, now it's today 
 I've innovated, took my inspirations in and made them 
 Into an original addition to your playlist 
 So now I meditate about how to elevate 
 'Cause Safe was the safety net to let me levitate 
 I'm picking my best fruit for you 
 You're the one, and I'd like tea for two 
 Come to the garden for a barbecue 
 And chill with me
