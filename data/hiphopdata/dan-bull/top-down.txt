Dan Bull 
 I'm basking in the sunlight, hi-hat sizzling 
 Snare cracking like it's blasting in a gun fight 
 The pattern of the drum's tight, kick pumping in your stomach 
 Something like the aftermath of a drunk night 
 Daft cunt, see I like music that has spunk 
 Thrash, pop, rap, punk, drazz-wop, jazz, funk 
 I'm beginning a vinyl collection 
 Thinking of buying all the decks and equipment then hitting the nightlife with a vengeance 
 But I've got a penchant for sitting in silence 
 Headphones hugging my noggin, I'm nodding my head to the said tones 
 I might be flesh and bones, but when I do a verse 
 My vibrations disperse through the universe 
 We can see the frequency, perceive them through the channels 
 I need a deeper feeling please, leave me with the ammo 
 White noise, clean my teeth, weaken the enamel 
 Street life's a squeeze like a needle to a camel 
 Please, I would leave in peace, retreating with the mammals 
 While leaves of trees are green at least, creeping in my camo 
 But a bee could see through these with ease, keys of a piano 
 Basked in light from black to white, from BC to Anno Domini 
 Beit Nun 
 There's no questioning Ben as an artist 
 My musical palette's not like yours 
 So the same brush I'll never be tarred with 
 I'm a sucker for a Hendrix guitar lick 
 But not a purist though, Kendrick Lamar's sick 
 Mate, head to the bar quick 
 And fetch me a large drink 
 I'm ready to get this cigar lit 
 Beer garden, start a party for the neighbours like 
 No sympathy, Marley and the Wailers, and Bacardi with a chaser 
 It's getting late so it's time to slip something a little harder in the shaker 
 Bit of Marvin on the playlist, then The Temptations 
 Followed by Smokey Robinson, we marvel at the greatness 
 I'm Syd Barrett on Interstellar Overdrive 
 I'm John Bonham in a hotel on a motorbike 
 I'm Ray Davies on a sunny afternoon 
 I'm Ian Curtis, I'm John Lennon, Bob Dylan and Keith Moon 
 Music helped me get through all I've been through 
 When just me, you, and the beat loop, how can I feel blue? 
 I've got videos and photographs if you need proof 
 I've lived, though I gave my plot away in the theme tune 
 Beit Nun up in your iPod docking station 
 Feel free to get up and leave if you're not relating 
 But if you are, take a seat, I'm down for the long awaited conversation 
 Two bonding strangers have when they're off their faces
