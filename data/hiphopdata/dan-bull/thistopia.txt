The dystopia 
 Gets slowly worse 
 Over the years 
 We're going to burn 
 And I'm sorry for making you scared 
 But it's a sorry state of affairs 
 When man's a virus with shoes, a violent abuser 
 Of the planet he resides on and relies on it too 
 I want to do something to change it 
 But I'm afraid it's inside us, entwined in our nature 
 You and I should face it - the primary trait that 
 Unites the races is the way we use nature and rape it 
 I'm trying to find pride in my nation 
 But I'll die waiting for higher civilisation 
 Sorry for making you scared 
 But it's a sorry state of affairs when 
 The dystopia 
 Gets slowly worse 
 Over the years 
 We're going to burn 
 Dystopia 
 Gets slowly worse 
 Over the years 
 We're going to burn 
 And I'm sorry for making you scared 
 But it's a sorry state of affairs - listen 
 The class system of a past Britain 
 That still runs fast and thick through the innards of every last citizen 
 If you're from Pakistan, black-skinned, or just act different 
 You'll be asked questions and blacklisted 
 The fact is we're attached umbilically 
 To a fetid capitalist trap full of misery 
 But that isn't what gets me, the ignorant hegemony 
 But the fact that we're happy to live with it 
 The disaffected youth are in effect living proof 
 That respect is reduced to a reckless abuse 
 Of the ends where they grew through the stem to the roots 
 They will step on your shoes then expect you to move 
 Flipping heck, next thing they'll do's 
 Have you hanging in a hood, neck through a noose 
 So whether you accept or you're scared of the truth 
 Say your prayers 'cause we're due for a desolate future 
 The dystopia 
 Gets slowly worse 
 Over the years 
 We're going to burn 
 Dystopia 
 Gets slowly worse 
 Over the years 
 We're going to burn
