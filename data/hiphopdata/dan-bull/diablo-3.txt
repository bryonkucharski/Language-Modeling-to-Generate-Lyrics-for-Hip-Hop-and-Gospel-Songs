(Ah) My name's Deckard Cain, reincarnate 
 I'm the author of the lore for this dark place 
 I understand you're a guy on a mission 
 But if you could just give a min, stay a while and listen 
 Because again the land of Sanctuary's fucked 
 By the forces of darkness, thank you very much 
 And I suppose I'm responsible for dealing with this 
 Demon epidemiological chronicle of a diabolical oracle, it's horrible 
 When your chance of living is thinner than a hair follicle 
 Smaller than a molecule, hell is more than metaphorical 
 It's down under the town in the cracks, underground like my raps 
 Now let me tell you the facts 
 You'll need these to get yourself through the acts 
 So ensure your ears are clear and sound gets through the wax 
 I come in one of five flavours at once 
 If you need speed then you'll favour the Monk 
 The Wizard is a mage, the Demon Hunter's ranged 
 The Barbarian is in a rage at the front 
 The Witch Doctor is the main name for shamanism 
 Today's the day you make the fate-changing decision 
 Make haste into the prison of the Dark Lords 
 Who start wars with us, they'll see we're hardcore 
 If you're struggling with Azmodan, just 
 Tap my number in and ask for Dan, 'cause 
 In that conundrum I am the man 
 To leave a demon heaving, gasping 
 Like it's asthma, damn, 'cause 
 I got the master plan 
 I got the master plan 
 I take my scrap to be crafted by an artisan 
 The improvement of loot is essential 
 With the exception of my weapon: the pencil 
 Tearing apart skeletal archers like parchment 
 Giving your heart a myocardial infarction 
 You'll beg my pardon if I look like an old gnome 
 But I've written whole tomes on the Soulstones 
 So lyrically I'm lethal, all I need is beats 
 And my speech to defeat the Prime Evil 
 We will succeed 'cause I'm a wizard 
 And I run this game like Blizzard
