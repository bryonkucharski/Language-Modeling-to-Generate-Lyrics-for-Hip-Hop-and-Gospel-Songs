My wisdom teeth are causing me trouble 
 Forming a huddle in the back of my mouth 
 And now to talk is a struggle 
 So I trade the punchlines for more of a subtle approach 
 And just hope you decode more than all of the puzzle 
 'Cause of course I've gone pop, I wasn't born in a bubble 
 Fuck my kingdom for a horse, I'd give my horse for a cuddle 
 And I'm bored of all the posturing a lot of hip hoppers bring 
 Sincerity's like love: it doesn't cost a thing 
 So always check the pocket of your jeans 
 Before you set the rinse on the washing machine 
 Buy a stack of birthday cards and presents 
 So you can use them in the event that you forget them 
 Then throw away fifty things you haven't used lately 
 Ideally you'd only keep what you use daily 
 Make the phone call that you've been putting off for months 
 It's a load off your mind and you'll be done in time for lunch 
 Pull out my wisdom teeth 
 To give to each of you 
 Who never will admit defeat 
 And I think I'll be A-OK 
 If I live to see the day 
 My wisdom teeth decay 
 Pull out my wisdom teeth 
 To give to each of you 
 Who never will admit defeat 
 And I think I'll be A-OK 
 Yeah, I'll be A-OK 
 I see and hear quotes everywhere 
 Proverbs and advice from experts, sages and inspirational figures 
 But it's not particularly useful in comparison to the wisdom I've acquired 
 Simply through living my day to day, mundane life 
 And with these abilities, I'm on a Steve Miller steez 
 We hear so much deep advice 
 Philosophical insight on the way we should lead our lives 
 But you don't really need to be Jesus Christ 
 Just read between the lines and then you'll be just fine 
 You don't need a preacher to teach or guide 
 You through the maze, each day leads you deep inside 
 So keep an eye out, see the lighthouse 
 Watch for the rocks and just reach for high ground 
 Patiently wait for the breeze to die down 
 Now I believe that we need a lie down 
 So I relax in the dentist's massive chair 
 Puffing on a heady mix of gas and air 
 The psychedelicism's elegance is evident 
 As black satin patterns pass and past passions flare 
 Yeah, and now there's plasma everywhere 
 Pull out my wisdom teeth 
 To give to each of you 
 Who never will admit defeat 
 And I think I'll be A-OK 
 If I live to see the day 
 My wisdom teeth decay 
 Pull out my wisdom teeth 
 To give to each of you 
 Who never will admit defeat 
 And I think I'll be A-OK 
 Yeah, I'll be A-OK
