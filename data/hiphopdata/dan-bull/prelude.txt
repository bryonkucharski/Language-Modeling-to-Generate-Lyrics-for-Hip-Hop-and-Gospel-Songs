Candlelight flickers across these hands that write 
 I sit and ponder the past and life 
 Just wishing and wanting an answer tonight 
 And so I am thinking and wondering asking why 
 Do things go wrong when they have been right 
 Where we used to frolic and laugh, we cry 
 Life's past its prime, I wish I could stop the hands of time 
 The end is nigh, a tick and a tock and the sands of time 
 Slip from the clock as they pass us by 
 As I'm sitting and watching the passers by 
 Stranded high, imprisoned and locked in the land of my mind 
 The living monotony hanging by 
 To limit and smother a man this shy 
 And to describe it's impossible though I can but try 
 And now as I lie, a shiver runs ominous down my spine 
 As a vision, a prophecy clouds my sight 
 I predict an apocalypse happens tonight 
 Clandestine, Our figurative god has cast the die 
 Has triggered the goal of his grand design 
 And the bigger the bomb is the faster we die 
 Abandon fright, and give up the worry and anger and spite 
 The difference is none if you stand and fight 
 So sisters and brothers hold hands, unite 
 While Dan says hi, and sings you a song as his last goodbye 
 Bye bye bye
