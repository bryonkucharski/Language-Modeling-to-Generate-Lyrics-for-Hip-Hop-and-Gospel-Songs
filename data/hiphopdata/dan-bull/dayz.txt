Look I know it's not often it's a zombie apocalypse 
 But I've got a big blow nobody can soften it 
 So, without further ado let me disclose what it's urgent to do 
 To avert your certain doom 
 I urge your alertness to the words in the tune 
 The last survivors band together 
 Grab supplies, ammo, whatever 
 It takes to stay ahead of the others 
 And run from them Hell For Leather 
 There's bad manners in the Soviet bloc 
 People call and they don't even knock 
 I was brought up and thought people owe me a lot 
 But I learned very shortly I'm only a dot 
 In the sight of a scope of a rifle a blokes aiming 
 Right at my dome and I'm going to be shot 
 I'm going down quicker than the blood that I'm losing 
 Oh my God, I've got to get a blood transfusion 
 How am I going to get it? Man, I better get moving 
 Before the other humans move in 
 The hammer in my head's getting madder and I'm woozy 
 Thought I heard a man shout, "Friendly", Who's he? 
 Can I trust him? Or should I bust him? 
 Full of bullets, finger on the trigger and I'm gonna pull it 
 DayZ, Day-DayZ, DayZ, Day-DayZ 
 DayZ, Day-DayZ, DayZ, Day-DayZ 
 I shot a zed in the head 
 But he didn't die because he was already dead 
 I shot a zed in the head 
 But he didn't die because he was already dead 
 I've got a backpack full of mad crap 
 Whatever you imagine I can craft that 
 Mags, maps, rags, raps, I can turn a gas can to a gas lamp 
 Gas canisters, magazines, bandannas and batteries 
 I'm an athlete, a survivor, try attacking me, then I'll find ya' 
 This is a patch that's full of disease 
 So you could catch a bullet with ease 
 Death comes as a sudden release 
 For he or she that'll struggle to see the wood for the trees 
 I've never had such hunger for beans 
 And I've drunk everything from the canteen in my jeans 
 I've got to stay hydrated to make it 
 But I might die from the painkillers 
 At the rate that I'm taking them 
 A bit of bacon would be amazing 
 My veganism dissipated and I'm a carnivore 
 Starting wars, turn a bad situation to a carnival 
 You can't say that you aren't involved 
 The outbreak of the plague took part of your soul 
 Humanity's hard to keep hold of 
 After you've halted the heart of a soldier 
 DayZed, Day-DayZed, DayZed, Day-DayZed 
 DayZed, Day-DayZed, DayZed, Day-DayZed
