We are the Khajiit, the elite sneak thief 
 Concealing the secrets that we each keep 
 With the leanest of feet and the meanest of teeth 
 We can clean out your keeps in just three minutes each 
 So that means if you need something stealing 
 Then really you need to just leave it to me, the Khajiit 
 Look it up, Skooma's the new drug and cooking it up 
 We produce it with moon sugar, it'll soon soothe your troubles 
 As you just succumb to the tune of the drums and the lutes 
 As they hum and they hoot and they strum and they shoot 
 With the stars, under the blue of the moons 
 As we run on the roofs through ruins and roots 
 We are ruling the roost robbing rubies and runes 
 You will rue being rude when you reach our lair 
 And you'll kneel at the throne of the prince of Elsweyr 
 Our opinion's the dominion is a kingdom that'll bring Nirn 
 To ascendance with a vengeance, not dependent on a thing, no 
 Our opinion's the dominion is a kingdom that'll bring Nirn

 We're Wood Elves, what else? 
 Wood houses are where we delve and we dwell in the dells 
 Some seldom would doubt if you touch our trees 
 You'll be held to account 
 Down for the count down under the canopy 
 What now for you? Well, you're becoming a canapé 
 See, we eat each other, we're cannibalistic 
 And it's a compliment if you should call us animalistic 
 We're symbiotic with the living things we live with 
 Resist affliction, Vigor, lead the leaves and lift spirits 
 These forests will remain forever Bosmer 
 Real archers in the woods, never mention Kevin Costner 
 I tote a bow that no one else could aim as good 
 So don't claim you could 
 Or I'll make acquainted, feather, brain and wood 
 Made of Aldmeri blood, the place we hail from, Valenwood 
 We came and took our native place and greatly raised it up 
 Our opinion's the dominion is a kingdom that'll bring Nirn 
 To ascendance with a vengeance, not dependent on a thing, no 
 Our opinion's the dominion is a kingdom that'll bring Nirn 
 To ascendance with a vengeance, not dependent on a thing, no 
 Yeah, be quiet now, we're the High Elves 
 We're tall enough to take things off really high shelves 
 We do the bidding of the scrolls of praxis 
 You'll find us casting magic over holding axes 
 Exalted and thin with golden tanned skin 
 Behold the aristocratic and magnanimous grand kin 
 Descended from the deities so say your prayers please 
 We've agents every place, increase the range Ayren sees 
 Clearly superior in whatever area we dare to appear in 
 There ain't a better Mer here, the more the merrier 
 So where are your men when you need them? 
 They see us and flee, fled in terror 
 You'll wish you wielded just some of that style 
 When we use the common tongue to summon that bile 
 If you come and get vile in the Summerset Isle 
 Then I'mma set fire to your bum and get wild 
 Our opinion's the dominion is a kingdom that'll bring Nirn 
 To ascendance with a vengeance, not dependent on a thing, no
