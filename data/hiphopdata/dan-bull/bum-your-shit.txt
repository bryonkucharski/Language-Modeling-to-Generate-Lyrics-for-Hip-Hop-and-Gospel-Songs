 Seven days of the week my brain's at it's peak 
 That's the payback you reap from being a blatant geek 
 But don't watch the way that I speak, listen to the lyrics 
 Then maybe you'll see why so many people feel it 
 My speech is lethal, meaning feeble people fear it 
 But if you fear it maybe you need to re-hear it 
 I talk about what other lyricists are scared to 
 I tackle issues you wish you could dare to 
 And fair do's if you're sticking to the horrorcore 
 But don't go moaning that nobody's wanting more 
 Sitting on bean bags listening to weed rap 
 Bitching that the kids would rather hear Relapse 
 Don't you see that you're missing the point? 
 'Cause no-one gives a shit what you stick in your joint 
 So if you're disappointed then learn a lesson 
 Convert to better methods and then heads'll yearn for seconds 
 We don't bum your shit 
 So come up with something better than it 
 When you're the only one to bum your shit 
 Then come up with something better than it

 Look, mmm, I've got to be real 
 There's not a lot of rappers out here that I honestly feel 
 You see me, I'd bite your hand off if you offered a deal 
 'Cause I've got kids that need warm water and a quality meal 
 For real, I pride myself on being versatile 
 Like my hooks Auto-Tuned, still keep the verses wild 
 So if you don't like me singing on my hooks 
 Then don't listen - the fact is, I couldn't give a... 
 Look, they're acting like they're Premier League 
 Forced multi-syllabics over knock-off Premier beats 
 In a scene where everybody seems to be next in the scene 
 And the need to be credible is becoming incredibly weak 
 Gzus, let's keep it moving 
 'Cause for people to feel your music you need improvement 
 Like live shows where you get your respect 
 They're like trapeze acts 'cause their life depends on the net

 We don't bum your shit 
 So come up with something better than it 
 When you're the only one to bum your shit 
 Then come up with something better than it

 Too many rappers just rap about rap 
 There's a whole world out there, rap about that 
 What happens now is a matter of fact 
 So if you want to keep it real, put that on a track 
 I stand back to back with novelists and poets 
 Activists, journalists, and those that show it's 
 An ugly world out there, when it should be beautiful 
 But if beauty is truth, then I stay true to form 
 Who'd have thought the class clown would back down 
 Into the background and lay some fat tracks down? 
 I stand proud behind what I believe 
 And what I believe is I can't believe what I've achieved 
 Every step of the way I get better 
 But nevertheless I make it my aim to elevate every day 
 No matter what it takes it's worth paying the price 
 'Cause the day you stop learning is the day you die
