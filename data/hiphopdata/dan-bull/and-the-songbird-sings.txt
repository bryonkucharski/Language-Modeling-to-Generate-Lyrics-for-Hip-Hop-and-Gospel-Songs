And the Songbird sings... 
 (It's Infinite) 
 This is for the voices who are unheard 
 Who never back-talked one word to the Songbird 
 This is for the second class citizens, and prisoners locked alone 
 I bring a list of things the prophet wants you not to know 
 I've got to blow the propaganda out the box and so 
 Open up the rift and put this disc into your Voxophone 
 I'll take your brain to places it doesn't often go 
 So brace yourself for take off and watch the show 
 I'm properly known as Booker DeWitt 
 And I've had enough of this shit 
 Fed up of being stuck in a rut 
 So I'm looking to rough up a couple of pricks 
 And accomplish a mission to look for a woman imprisoned and stuck in a city where something's amiss 
 Like the rhythm the government's drumming to whip the anger of the people 
 Daily handling the stress 
 While I've just ambled in from gambling and landed in a mess 
 And I'm telling ya, Elizabeth isn't a damsel in distress 
 She's the damn best wingman to ever don a dress 
 To be honest, we've loads of things 
 In common, we both can bring an opening 
 We're probably closer twins 
 Than Robert and Rosalind 
 I throw my grapple and aim 
 To blow the back of your brain out 
 And contemplate on why we play those irrational games 
 My main foe is Zachary Hale Comstock 
 The day his reign begun, a fundamental bomb dropped 
 Columbia's on lockdown 
 Every day they're destroying somebody, so what now? 
 Send for Daisy Fitzroy 
 The rich get fatter, while the slums are getting hungrier 
 It's a matter of time before they pull the rug from under you 
 We'll make your money disappear from you like a conjurer 
 And overthrow the fundies that are plundering Columbia 
 And the Songbird sings... 
 (It's Infinite) 
 So, I know this is absurd and sounds bananas 
 But have you observed the way they worship founding fathers? 
 That's why the Vox Populi have hurtled out the darkness 
 Emerged, about to start to turn around and clout this heartlessness 
 If this disc is flying, you'll be dying like you're Hyacinth 
 Hirelings or higher things 
 Vox Populi's guys or Jeremiah Fink's 
 If they pile in on me, then they're receive undying violence 
 I'll lynch the pious kings with the silent wire strings 
 From the tiny violins that won't be crying when they're lying singed 
 Ignite the tinder, set the sky alight in flights of cinders 
 And let freedom ring inside your cries like the singer 
 That's like trying to hide your violent injuries, as if they're minor things, by keeping just a tiny thimble on your finger 
 One hand holds Vigors 
 The other pulls triggers 
 I'm a multi-tasking action man with a glass full of malt liquor 
 Salt licker 
 Rapture's contraptions are fantastic 
 But don't exist yet, so that is how we pack Plasmids 
 No need to hack gadgets 
 The manner in which I battle a Handyman is akin to black magic 
 My life's a play where every act's tragic 
 And the Songbird sings...
