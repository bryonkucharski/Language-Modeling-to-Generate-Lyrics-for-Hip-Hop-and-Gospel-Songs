Dan Bull 
 Oi, Shizzy 
 (Yeah?) 
 Rap battle? Super Smash Brothers? 
 (Wreck) 
 Sorted 
 VI Seconds 
 Look, you've been invited to the battlefield of war 
 With a cast of characters I'm sure you have all seen before 
 I'm the Master Hand from smacking you, I'm snatching up your score 
 Ganon to the Dorf, slamming to the floor, cats I'm packing up for sure 
 Trophy on my shelf after Yoshi loses his health 
 Eating like Wario, I gradually loosen my belt 
 'Cause I get a tad gassy after having devoured 
 Competitors for an hour, more boss than Bowser 
 Dan Bull 
 I'm a bad mother, the master of Super Smash Brothers 
 True fact, don't believe me? Then you can ask others 
 Got fond memories of smashing them like past lovers 
 So amass your gang together for the Last Supper 
 I'll hack and slash them like a beam sword through a pack of butter 
 I'm heavyweight rolling through like a fat trucker 
 Slap daft buggers from behind like a back scrubber 
 Give you a palette swap to blue and black colours 
 VI Seconds 
 Back brother, venues get ripped for days 
 Powerful, like Skull Kid, I'll flip the stage 
 It won't take a Final Smash from me to bring you D-Day 
 I'll just wind up and punch your lights out like DK 
 What did he say? You never heard someone mad before? 
 Murdering anyone ever to make it, like the Master Core? 
 If you're taking a minute to battle it's easy 
 Break the controller, blast your TV 
 That'll be way better off for your health 
 It'll be worse if you ever did see me 
 Dan Bull 
 Smash, smash 
 Brother, smash, smash 
 You better dash, dash 
 Brother, dash, dash 
 Or you'll get smashed, smash 
 Brother, smash, smash 
 You better dash, dash 
 Brother, dash, dash 
 Or you'll get smashed 
 Do you want to demolish this jaunty song? 
 Take me on one v one, I'll prove you promptly wrong 
 You're an iddy biddy little Diddy, I'm a Donkey Kong 
 I'm a Fazioli grand piano, you're a Honky Tonk 
 Is it bad form to smack you off the platform 
 So hard your head cracks open like a Smash Ball? 
 My home run bat will smack you through the back door 
 So hard you'll be like: "Ow, what you do that for?" 
 VI Seconds 
 Spitting that fire and bringing you hell 
 Chillen in first? I got a Blue Shell 
 Go tell ya momma and go tell ya gramma 
 If they play too I'm swinging a hammer 
 I'm taking no damage I'm holding the star 
 And I'm more of a star than a Luma with bars 
 A legend in fact you can ask about him 
 I'll burn you like punches from Captain Falcon 
 Dan Bull 
 I'll cook and sauté you till we need some more players 
 What's fun is four players, as fun as foreplay is 
 I ain't got beef with you, you little Pikachu 
 But come and see me on the stage if you're eager to 
 You'll see the truth, the reason for my fame 
 When I finish you, what can I say but "Game" 
 Smash, smash 
 Brother, smash, smash 
 You better dash, dash 
 Brother, dash, dash 
 Or you'll get smashed, smash 
 Brother, smash, smash 
 You better dash, dash 
 Brother, dash, dash 
 Or you'll get smashed 
 Smashed 
 Smashed 
 Smashed
