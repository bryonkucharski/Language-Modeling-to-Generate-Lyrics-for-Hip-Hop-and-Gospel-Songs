I'm not the kind of guy that you would likely see 
 Criticising anybody, unless I believed 
 That they deserve to be told I disagree 
 With something that they've done specifically 
 Now I'm all right with some types of piracy 
 But not the violent type you find on the high seas 
 Why fight your allies in times of peace 
 Then hide behind a pile of lies like you were trying to police? 
 So it's okay for you to go crazily 
 Overboard with excessive use of force? 
 Though sticks and stones may break your bones 
 They don't provoke a massacre with no remorse 
 But never mind that, don't give it another thought 
 'Cause provididing aid's clearly an act of war. 
 You should do anything, no matter how debauched 
 To stop support from ever getting to your ports. 
 I knew a Jewish girl, and she was a pearl. 
 What I'm trying to say is that I've got no hatred 
 I've got nothing on Jews, baby. 
 This is aimed at The Jewish State, yeah 
 It's like I have witnessed Zionism's Rennaissance 
 You and your mates in the States really get along. 
 They veto anything that doesn't let you get what you want 
 Even if it's sending planes to bomb Lebanon. 
 Or a naval blockade dawn raid with every weapon drawn 
 Treating aid workers as agents of Hezbollah. 
 Your reputation is tainted for evermore 
 Stop... have a think about it 
 You've attacked Lebanon, you've attacked Egypt 
 Even to Syria you're dealing blows 
 You've attacked Jordan, you've had a war with 
 Every bordering country I know. 
 British Israeli relations are so low 
 So I hope I don't become another Shlomo. 
 This song's never going to win a MOBO 
 Even though I flow like the oil to the shores of the Gulf coast 
 Or the blood in the waters of your coast 
 I knew a Jewish girl, and she was a pearl. 
 What I'm trying to say is that I've got no hatred 
 I've got nothing on Jews, baby. 
 This is aimed at The Jewish State, yeah 
 To Zion
