May I be allowed to voice my opinion to you 
 Today I feel like I made a choice 
 And now there's no turning back 
 Isn't it great when you're a failure in life 
 And all that you've aimed for's gone away from your sights 
 Whilst your top eight mates are plain sailing through life 
 It's grey when you're bright but unable to quite 
 Make it through the day without evading the strife 
 I stay awake through the nights, lay in wait for the light 
 Brain vacant despite the debates in my mind 
 Like maybe my plane may have strayed from its flight 
 Failed to pervade and faded from the sky 
 Dan Bull's a candle with no flame to ignite 
 It's painful to write, I strain just to type 
 A page full of lines and I've drained all my pride 
 Eyes dry, I'm unable to cry 
 Time flies and I trail behind 
 You may say it's my fault, maybe you're right 
 Maybe it's myself to blame for my plight 
 I overdose and close my eyes 
 Till I'm comatose and slowly rise 
 Over rows of roads and signs 
 Flows, tides froze in time 
 From lows to highs until there's only skies 
 No lonely lives cloaked in phony lies 
 No disguise, the skies are open wide 
 It goes as no surprise 
 No surprises, no alarms 
 No one cries, I'm going calmly 
 I'm dazed, I seem to spend my days in a daydream 
 I've been this way way before the day I was eighteen 
 Haters say to me I waste the space to breathe 
 Wait for the train to Leeds with my claims in my case and leave 
 Please, believe me, I'd say I agree 
 Let them eat cake? I'll take it and eat it 
 Jeez, even taking a beating's a great deal easier 
 Than waking up each day in a place full of fears 
 And praying for amnesia with a faceful of tears 
 The pain's so severe that it aches and it sears 
 Peel away the veneer, the real state's revealed 
 I've been patient for years, just waiting to hear 
 Someone say that it's OK, that I'm safe 'cause they're here 
 But it's blatantly clear that that day's nowhere near 
 I hate to tempt fate but I'd be grateful for either 
 The faith of a believer or to fade away and disappear 
 I overdose and close my eyes 
 Till I'm comatose and slowly rise 
 Over rows of roads and signs 
 Flows, tides froze in time 
 From lows to highs until there's only skies 
 No lonely lives cloaked in phony lies 
 No disguise, the skies are open wide 
 It goes as no surprise 
 No surprises, no alarms 
 No one cries, I'm going calmly 
 So I'm closing my curtains and making my bed 
 'Cause no one on earth knows the pain in my head 
 No one knows of the hurt or the strain or the dread 
 Though I'm over the worst I can't face things ahead 
 I'm escaping instead, I'm leaving this place 
 Erasing my thread and I'm cleaning my slate 
 Safe now I've fled, serene and sedate 
 There's no waking the dead when they beam into space 
 I've seen into space, shaken hands with the stars 
 And the feeling's great when you're landing on Mars 
 Dreamy and weightless in ambient dark 
 Only hearing the sweetness of transient harps 
 With my hand on my heart I assure you it's bliss 
 Soaring back to the starkness before you existed 
 Before you were born, before you were kissed 
 Before you were torn from the immortal abyss 
 I overdose and close my eyes 
 Till I'm comatose and slowly rise 
 Over rows of roads and signs 
 Flows, tides froze in time 
 From lows to highs until there's only skies 
 No lonely lives cloaked in phony lies 
 No disguise, the skies are open wide 
 It goes as no surprise 
 No surprises, no alarms 
 No one cries, I'm going calmly 
 I'm at the last act 
 No now amount of dark can harm me
