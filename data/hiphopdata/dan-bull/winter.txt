Sleep through nuclear winter 
 And rest 
 Heal, reinforce, hold on 
 And rise 
 Welcome to your kingdom 
 Your paradi** 
 Welcome to your kingdom 
 Your paradi** 
 Bye bye bye 
 In heaven everything is fine 
 In heaven everything is fine 
 In heaven everything is fine 
 You got your good things 
 And you got mine 
 In heaven everything is fine
