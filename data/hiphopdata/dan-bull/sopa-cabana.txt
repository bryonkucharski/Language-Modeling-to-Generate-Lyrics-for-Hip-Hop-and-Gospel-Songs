SOPA CABANA (A Warning From A Dystopian Future) by Dan Bull & Friends 
 I was born way back in 1986 
 I'm an old man now 
 Bu I remember how it used to be 
 Any now my grandchildren ask me 
 Grandad they say 
 Can you tell us what it was like 
 In the days of the Internet 
 You know, before SOPA 
 And I'd tell them 
 When was that? Hmm, let me see 
 Some time back in the early 21st century 
 I remember when the Internet was FREE 
 Behind my keyboard, people let me be 
 See, there used to be a thing called Freedom of Speech 
 We had freedom to teach each other, freedom to preach 
 Freedom to share culture and circulate ideas 
 Without the state trying to interfere, enter fear 
 We lost that freedom, not freedom as in free beer 
 But the freedom to be free from fear, even here 
 In the United Kingdom, the fact that I'm from England 
 Isn't a matter that matters to our new masters and kings 
 I was a chap who could sing and distribute my music 
 And like minded citizens could listen to it 
 I couldn't afford an orchestra, I was a poor performer 
 In more ways than one so I sought an alternate formula 
 Reinterpreted the media around me 
 Satirized the leaders' lies on found beats 
 Talked shop on top of a sample of a rock band 
 At least we used to, until rap got banned 
 At the SOPA 
 SOPA Cabana 
 The place where SOPA 
 SOPA can ban ya 
 We're At the SOPA 
 SOPA Cabana 
 The place where SOPA 
 SOPA can ban ya 
 You didn't have to act twisted to get your ass blacklisted 
 Just annoy a big business and get fisted 
 They had a vested interest in Congress 
 If one messed with them, then there'd be one less 
 Our representatives never represented shit 
 So the internet was history, this was the end of it 
 I remember it like it was yesterday 
 I guess that day, I was too lazy to investigate 
 The escapades of another state's government 
 Now I'm left to pay because the covenant 
 That they signed that day and ratified in law 
 Zipped our mouths up and took away our appetite for more! 
 I can't do much now about the way it is 
 But if I could go back and change things I'd say this 
 Truth is beauty 
 At least it used to be 
 And if you disagree with my views 
 Then you can sue me 
 In the meantime I'll keep using YouTube 
 Even if it means that I need to find a new medium 
 IRC, Darknets, so digital's down now? 
 I'll use pigeons and smoke signals
