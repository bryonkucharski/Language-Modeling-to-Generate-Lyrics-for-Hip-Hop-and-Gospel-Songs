When I was a young boy, I wanted to be a film star 
 I wanted to star in my own action film called "Motorbike Man 12" 
 I don't know why specifically twelve, it just sounded cool 
 But anyway, needless to say, "Motorbike Man 12" never actually materialized 
 But instead, I have this 
 Check out my motorbike, I hope you like it 
 I'm a mix of a fighter pilot and a cyclist 
 Never mind physics, because I find it a little inapplicable 
 Right when I fly, limits never apply 
 And it's evident I'm not going to be the first daredevil to die 
 My hell is a temperate climate, so I'm revving on the engine 
 Just to get the frickin' temperature rising, never mind driving 
 I get my high riding, spinning my tires as I'm descending and climbin' 
 Livin' the high life, I'm literally high, pour me a Mai Tai 
 With a little lemon and lime in 
 All I need to eat is three square meals 
 And all I need to move is two round wheels 
 And when I nail a perfect landing I can't find the words 
 To describe 'dem feels', I lack an equal, a mix of man and eagle 
 Savagely ravaging people, Leave them wobbling like a weeble 
 I take a track and leave a battle scene 
 Gravity hasn't been something that particularly hassled me 
 People are chatting "See, well I imagine he's been to NASA's astronaut academy" 
 "Hasn't he?", You're lagging, keep up, all but forgotten 
 Stand like a man or you'll be falling on your bottom 
 Ragdoll rolling on the floor, you're performance is really rather poor 
 If you're struggling to keep up anymore 
 I'd really like for you to tell me what the hell you're here for 
 I wield more balls than tournaments in snooker 
 A super duper loop-the-looper 
 The manner in which I'm shooting through the hoops 
 Is moving you into a stupor 
 Face full of smoke like the user of a hookah 
 I'll leave you newbies trying to reach the new bit 
 Finding each solution and can finally be moving 
 From motorcycle riding to writing decent music 
 My old style's miles higher 
 It's Trials Evolution! 
 "Motorbike Man 12" in very, very, very selective cinemas too 
 When I say selective it doesn't even exist 
 I still want to do the film "Motorbike Man 12", please
