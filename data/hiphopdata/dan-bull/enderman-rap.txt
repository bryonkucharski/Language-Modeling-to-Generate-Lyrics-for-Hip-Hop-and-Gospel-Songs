Dan Bull 
 : 
 Sit up and listen, I riff on the rhythm 
 The sickest musician, the slickest magician 
 Who'll slip and then zip into different positions 
 While lifting a brick with no slip of permission 
 I'm not the most vicious of villain 
 I'm nicking it just to make vanilla thrilling 
 I'm not into killing but if you were 
 Given the gift of intuition 
 Then keep me within your peripheral vision 
 'Cause I'm of a jittery disposition 
 I'm a nervous guy that prefers to hide 
 I'm terrible shy and I don't know why 
 So please do me the following courtesy 
 And never look me in the purple eyes 
 I'm averse to being observed at night 
 So if you see me you deserve to die 
 You don't want to mess with the endermen 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no 
 You don't want to mess with the endermen 
 No, no, no, no, no... no! 
 I see you peeking at me through the glass in the door 
 What, chap, are you asking for more? 
 Boy, you're jibbering jabbering like an old 
 Man reminiscing of back on the war 
 I'm naturally, massively tall 
 I should be practising basket-ty ball 
 But I can't find a ball without corners at all 
 So I'm passing the time by unstacking your wall 
 If we pass in the hall, you're gon'afto ignore me 
 Perhaps you should look at the grass on the floor 
 Grab a map and explore the various biomes 
 But be aware this is my home 
 I roam through the night alone 
 Hoping to find someone I can bone 
 But I'm out of sight and mind and time 
 Like a rotary dial phone 
 I don't want to die alone 
 My type of solo's a xylophone 
 You don't want to mess with the endermen 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no 
 You don't want to mess with the endermen 
 No, no, no, no, no... Rockit! 
 Rockit 
 : 
 You don't want to mess with the endermen 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no 
 You don't want to mess with the endermen 
 No, no, no, no, no... 
 Don't look me in the eye, you better run and hide 
 I'm chasing after you until you die 
 Deadly as a knife, beautifully designed 
 I'm hunting you tonight until you die 
 It's time to tell the truth, a bomb you can't defuse 
 So easily amused to watch you die 
 Don't you try to fight, you're lucky you're alive 
 I have you in my sights... no, no, no, no

 : 
 Now you see me, now you don't 
 Shoving a dirt block down your throat 
 You better not be getting out your boat 
 I suggest that you don't leave the house alone 
 Oh, no, I'm on a mission 
 To win this staring competition 
 I'll let you live on just one condition 
 If you put a pumpkin upon, you're forgiven 
 No, no, no, no
