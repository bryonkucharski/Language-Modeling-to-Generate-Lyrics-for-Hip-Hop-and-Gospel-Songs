Shizzy VI 
 Warrior filled with metal gears, walking the size of a Metal Gear 
 Refer to me as Raiden, feel the wrath of my blade and view my metal gear 
 Slick as a Gray Fox, with the telekinetic ability 
 Of a Psycho Mantis with the moves of an Ocelot 
 I'mma show the whole world what my plan is 
 Domination; that's day by day in a Metal Gear Rex or a Metal Gear Ray 
 Launching a rocket, predicting your moves, plug into a whole new socket 
 Why? 'Cause I'm watching, I'll sever your arms 
 While reading the data on your memory card 
 You're never as hard, I'm solid like Plissken 
 When rhyming my mission, snipe from the distance 
 A lyrical depiction of greatness 
 A Son of Liberty with Guns of the Patriots 
 On a substance where I need water 
 Or I'll trip out and won't be a Peace Walker 
 King Cobra, snake eater, when I start rising I'll blaze speakers 
 Till the day that 6 is a massive name 
 Making rappers go ghost, bringing Phantoms Pain 
 A master swordsman that you can't handle 
 Solid Shizzy with Liquid Dan Bull 
 You spit sick gamble, lose your profits 
 You'll be Crying Wolf with no way to stop it 
 I'm a Big Boss, turning artists purple 
 Bringing all the sorrow, best call the Colonel 
 Raw for sure, yo, you ain't on my level 
 Hence why I possess your woman like Meryl 
 Never gonna settle, I'm never gonna be suffering 
 Waving a finger right at the government 
 Weapons at the ready from my heads to my socks 
 Like Snake's trademark, I'll put you in a box 
 Snake, Snake 
 Dan Bull 
 Dan Bull 
 Sneaking around, not a peep or a sound 
 From my feet on the ground, but if people have found 
 Me then I down these with a leap 
 And a bound, then leave like a thief in a crowd 
 I'm the lead lethal elite 
 Look at me, can you see the physique? Sweet 
 I need it for griefing and breaching the peace 
 When I'm breaching a keep, but I keep it discrete 
 You will see what I mean when I creep knee-deep 
 In the evil and leave with not even a squeak 
 To me, people seem inane 
 And when they see my name it doesn't mean the same thing 
 Me? I've got the meanest aim, think 
 I was a Green Beret, I never squeeze and pray 
 You better leave in haste, believe you may 
 Never see the day or breathe again 
 A snake in the grass, I lay awake in your path 
 And they are making a massive mistake if they ask it 
 I've faith in the task; their face, I'm taking it fast 
 And breaking it past the point their next 
 Of kin could name it from snaps 
 You're not up to the skilled task 
 Your style's like me, it gets old real fast 
 Genetically modified, what a guy 
 So I often wonder why I have only got one eye 
 I'm a clone, so I'm not alone 
 Grown in a test tube, I'm the best dude that I know 
 I'm a son of Big Boss, but I don't give a toss 
 Because I'm a bigger boss, pick a sod and flip them off 
 I'm a raw dude, cutting all through you waves 
 Like the blade of a sawtooth through a raw fruit 
 But call me Snake Plissken and you're risking 
 A major plagiaristic lawsuit
