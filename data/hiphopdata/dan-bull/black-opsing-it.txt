Introduction, get a ping from Hudson 
 With a set of specific instructions to bust in 
 From Alaskan backwoods, recapture Frank Woods 
 You'll never find a finer example of manhood 
 Look, capping crooks like Captain Hook, I'm that good 
 Snapping necks like matchwood you bastard 
 I've got a taste for pain as if I drank blood 
 I haven't seen your face in ages, have a man hug 
 Shoot at me and I'll shoot you back 
 The future is bleak? Nah, the future is black 
 I said shoot at me and I'll shoot you back 
 The future is bleak? Nah, the future is black 
 I'm Black Opsing it, brap, pop the clip 
 Into my pistol and watch this shit 
 I'm Black Opsing it, brap, pop the clip 
 Into my pistol and watch this shit 
 I'm a Vietnam vet, the damn best 
 Messing with your head as if I'm Russian Roulette 
 And yet, I'm a respectable professional 
 And best of all, I'm the closest that you'll ever get 
 To being Charlton Heston, fool 
 I was the best in school, exceptional 
 But then I left it all to get some tools 
 And head back to the future 
 Stealth action shooter 
 C.I.A. man, Marine Captain Trooper 
 Shoot at me and I'll shoot you back 
 The future is bleak? Nah, the future is black 
 I said shoot at me and I'll shoot you back 
 The future is bleak? Nah, the future is black 
 I'm Black Opsing it, brap, pop the clip 
 Into my pistol and watch this shit 
 I'm Black Opsing it, brap, pop the clip 
 Into my pistol and watch this shit 
 To battle Alex Mason, that'd take some adaptation 
 I'm the line between rivalry and annexation 
 Now I'm handing the plate on to David 
 For another generation of bullet penetration 
 As enemies are taken out without hesitation 
 For stealth infiltration or sheer devastation 
 Shoot at me and I'll shoot you back 
 The future is bleak? Nah, the future is black 
 I'm Black Opsing it, brap, pop the clip 
 Into my pistol and watch this shit 
 I'm Black Opsing it, brap, pop the clip 
 Into my pistol and watch this shit 
 I'm Black Opsing it, brap, pop the clip 
 Into my pistol and watch this shit
