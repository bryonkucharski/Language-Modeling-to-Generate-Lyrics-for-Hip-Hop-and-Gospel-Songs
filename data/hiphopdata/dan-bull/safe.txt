I've hungered enough for the humblest stuff 
 From running the country to just someone to love 
 But enough is enough, I'm done with the world 
 So I'll succumb and return us to the substance we come from 
 We see bubbles above the submarine 
 As I plunge us deep, three-hundred leagues under the sea 
 There's a feeling of release as as our feelings are released 
 And we feel immediately at peace 
 It's less easy to see as the light fades 
 And my face is emblazoned with night's shade 
 I wait as the sides of the ride shake 
 And vibrate like they're portraying my mindstate 
 I'm inside, safe, encased in a cocoon 
 But soon it'll take my life away 
 But I made the choice to die today 
 So I may as well enjoy the ride 
 Man, you are spoiled and you've 
 Thrown your toys out the pram 
 It's these moments of silliness 
 That spoil it for every two one 
 No longer am I looking into the sky 
 I'm seeing into your eye
