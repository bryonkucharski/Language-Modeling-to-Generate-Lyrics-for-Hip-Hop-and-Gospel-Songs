EA, more like GA-Y? 
 The Family Research Council are doubtful 
 Of anything but conventional spousal arousal 
 The downfall of society is gay gay games 
 It's like the KKK came at gays 
 In the lamest of ways, laying the blame on EA 
 Aiming the flames in their face but they have made a mistake 
 The very basic aim that makes a game a game is choice 
 So if you take the choice away then what's the flaming point? 
 It is okay to go gay-ming, whatever pushes your buttons 
 It is okay to go gay-ming, hey, it's just co-operative play 
 There's gays in cinema, there's gays in literature 
 There's gays in nature, even gay general practitioners 
 Folks go for ovaries or are testicular particular 
 So isn't prohibiting it a little bit ridiculous? 
 To get your knickers in a twist over someone else's 
 Thinking too much about whose bum they're pals with 
 You waste your days away complaining about trousers 
 And who pulls them down, is there something you should tell us? 
 It is okay to go gay-ming, whatever pushes your buttons 
 It is okay to go gay-ming, hey 
 If Jesus was a gamer he'd play Mass Effect 
 And the fact that there was gayness wouldn't make him that upset 
 See, he'd be more inclined to deplore the kind of bigotry 
 That enforces "don't ask, don't tell" inside the military 
 And that's the thing I see you righteously fight for guidance 
 But on gratuitous violence then you are silent 
 But unlike the Rebel Alliance your petty defiance 
 And whether it's pious will die under the light of science 
 Because it is okay to go gay-ming, whatever pushes your buttons 
 It is okay to go gay-ming, hey 
 It's okay
