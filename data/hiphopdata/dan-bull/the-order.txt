Order, order 
 Let the right honorable gentleman speak 
 These dark streets creep with half breeds 
 We can't see through the smog; the deep fog falls, we can't breathe 
 We can't seem to keep the peace, appease the beast 
 Police the streets easily, you see 
 We have been seemingly waging a war 
 Ceaselessly since the days of yore and ages before 
 We came from the court of King Arthur 
 And we've been battling happily ever after 
 Knights in shining armor never died; a timeless martyr 
 We ride from by the harbour to the heart of night and farther 
 So hide inside your parlour 
 Unless you'd like to try to find whose knives are sharper 
 I will slice you like a barber 
 But the demons of Fleet Street aren't Sweeney Todd 
 Barbarically to half breeds, he's a teeny dot 
 It's like likening the hijabi to a bikini top 
 I know, these asynchronous references should really stop 
 The Order is heading for war 
 More important than ever before 
 The Order is heading for war 
 And I warn you, we'd better be ready at dawn 
 So, in no particular order, let me introduce the Order 
 First of all, there's me, Sir Percival 
 The author of this verse I rip with vicious flow 
 And then there's Isabeau 
 What's that? No realistic women in gaming? Is it though? 
 She's wicked, bro, I haven't met a classier lassie yet 
 And I'll bet you'll laugh at the banter with Lafayette 
 Sir Galahad's a gallant lad, so glad I had him gallop 
 Had I not, the team would be approximately three quarters as bad as that 
 Together, we're battling infestation of perverted termites 
 And instead of bug killer, we've thermite 
 Turing the searchlight on them till we hit the turnpike 
 And despite the dark, the lights in our hearts will burn bright 
 Like a burning Zeppelin and by my reckoning 
 We've earned the right to eternal life in Heaven 
 So God better let us in and by my reckoning 
 We've earned the right to eternal life in Heaven 
 So God better let us in 
 The Order is heading for war 
 More important than ever before 
 The Order is heading for war 
 And I warn you, we'd better be ready at dawn 
 Order 
 Order
