We called it the Traveller 
 The Light that it brought us from blackness 
 To widen, explore other planets, us 
 A tiny fault on our planet's surface 
 Alive and reborn and expanding thus 
 We must try to be more than our ancestors 
 So let's rise before we're turned back to dust 
 And fight the force that unravelled us 
 Redefine our whole existence, colonise the Solar System 
 Set our sights on the skies up high 
 And find the stars our roles are written in 
 Magnificent, munificent 
 Giving a gift to the citizens who wish on them 
 Lifting them up from indifference 
 Shifting them into significance 
 A Golden Age, to control your fate is all the rage 
 Flip the script, fold the page 
 This is it, behold the stage 
 We've made the maps but face the facts 
 Everything great we've attained just may collapse 
 The Collapse has taken our cake away 
 And we aim to take it back 
 Any alien race invading our space 
 We're making them pay for that 
 So raid, attack in waves 
 We'll aim at your face and blast away the mask 
 Or take an axe and hack away till we break your back 
 Grenades and flak won't chase us back 
 We're built to stay in the Milky Way's new neighbours' spat 
 We came from caves and paved the way to today so hey, perhaps 
 That indicates the fact this teensy race adapts, we're made to last 
 The worse our circumstance is the more certain the chance is 
 We'll stand resistant, persistently grin in the face of hostility and live 
 Now this is the law of the jungle 
 As old and as true as the sky 
 The wolf that shall keep it may prosper 
 But the wolf that shall break it must die 
 As the creeper that girdles the tree trunk 
 The law runneth forward and back 
 For the strength of the pack is the wolf 
 And the strength of the wolf is the pack 
 Look, guided by the Light we fight the Darkness, so try to start shit 
 You'll see the real reason why we can't be sparred with 
 The Guardian ranks are highly advanced 
 Full body armour, no cardigan thanks, our armoury's crammed 
 Fully stocked with rockets, dropships, SR3s and tanks 
 My blood be pumping, like I'm bungee jumping 
 Feel the drum keep thumping, like a humvee's frontpiece rumbling 
 No fronting, I'm confronting sunk drinks, and now I'm drunk 
 And I want to get a punch in on something 
 Pull you limb from limb 
 Pop off the top of your cranium like a pumpkin 
 Slam dunk it, in the dustbin, so don't just run, sprint! 
 'Cause I'm coming and I'm running and gunning 
 And I'm a gonna leave you looking like a dumpling 
 Dum sim, dim sum, I've done things and then some 
 I've seen some things you wouldn't believe 
 Even if I took a picture 
 The Exo vex the Vex so the Awoken will leave the Ogres broken 
 I'll give the Cabal a kick in the balls, the Fallen will fall once more 
 Thralls all on the floor, got a Goblin hobbling 
 So that Phogoths say "oh gosh" 
 They won't want to step out of line 
 Or so help me, I will go out my mind 
 I'm a mastermind, attack the Hive 
 Black the eye of an Acolyte 
 That smarts, you don't have to fight to have smarts 
 But you've got to have that to fight 
 I speak on behalf of my species 
 And defy you to get the best of me 
 I'm owed success and will accept no less 
 It is my destiny 
 Now this is the law of the jungle 
 As old and as true as the sky 
 The wolf that shall keep it may prosper 
 But the wolf that shall break it must die 
 As the creeper that girdles the tree trunk 
 The law runneth forward and back 
 For the strength of the pack is the wolf 
 And the strength of the wolf is the pack 
 Now this is the law of the jungle 
 As old and as true as the sky 
 The wolf that shall keep it may prosper 
 But the wolf that shall break it must die 
 As the creeper that girdles the tree trunk 
 The law runneth forward and back 
 For the strength of the pack is the wolf 
 And the strength of the wolf is the pack 
 Earth? We'll be taking it back 
 Mercury? Taking it back 
 Mars? We're taking it back 
 Venus? We're taking it back 
 Saturn? We're taking it back 
 We're taking it back 
 Aliens, they can attack 
 We'll raise the stakes and erase the Collapse 
 Sharp as the blade of a razor 
 And fast as a hummingbird's heart 
 That's been tazered and caffeinated 
 Then taped and played back insanely fast 
 Ha, made you laugh 
 I'm keeping your spirits up, never give it up 
 Whoever's giving you jip, never give a fuck 
 Approach this trial with an open mind, feel the flows and rhymes 
 Glow just like the Awoken's eyes, it's closing time 
 No scope and snipe any Crotan Hive 
 From Mercury's ruined gardens, to the swamps of Old Chicago 
 We will reclaim our homes once more with bravado 
 Though it may be hard, hope is the fuel that burns our fire 
 That's why we'll fight till we win or die, we won't retire 
 That's why we'll fight till we win or die, we won't retire 
 Now this is the law of the jungle 
 As old and as true as the sky 
 The wolf that shall keep it may prosper 
 But the wolf that shall break it must die 
 As the creeper that girdles the tree trunk 
 The law runneth forward and back 
 For the strength of the pack is the wolf 
 And the strength of the wolf is the pack 
 Now this is the law of the jungle 
 As old and as true as the sky 
 The wolf that shall keep it may prosper 
 But the wolf that shall break it must die 
 As the creeper that girdles the tree trunk 
 The law runneth forward and back 
 For the strength of the pack is the wolf 
 And the strength of the wolf is the pack
