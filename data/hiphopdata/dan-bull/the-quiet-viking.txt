There's a delicate line between a friend 
 And something else 
 And I've never been quite sure 
 How to tell 
 Heard words that weren't there in your body language 
 As a buddy I thought I had an advantage 
 I knew you, you knew me 
 And I briefly believed in the power of magic 
 Seeing you smile was the ultimate pleasure 
 Fishing for compliments, I was hunting for treasure 
 Summoned to heaven, platonic love becoming untethered 
 The way you'd comfort me when under the weather 
 And how we'd cuddle together under your umbrella 
 You must think I'm such a dumb fellow 
 I'd have done better leaving it alone 
 Even if I'd known we were going to grow; be with different folks 
 I was going to plant a seed and let it grow free 
 Then an oak tree develops slowly 
 Now the leaves on my future family tree 
 Are fruits imaginary 
 And I'm so lonely 
 Oh, me... 
 There's a delicate line between a friend 
 And something else 
 And I've never been quite sure 
 How to tell 
 Tighten up your bowtie 
 'Cause guys in your position don't cry 
 Do not be be frightened - really you won't die 
 Your deeds and writings reveal you: both sides 
 Lighting up on the roadside 
 Driving over the strobe light 
 It's the rise of defiant Dan; I'm a quiet man 
 But still spent time inside in a riot van 
 Blindsided without the benefit of hindsight 
 My eyes were as wide as a frying pan 
 You might summise I'm devising a higher plan 
 Redesigning my life with an iron hand 
 It's now or never 
 I've got to pull myself together 
 Can't waste days staying in the house forever 
 Come out to the desert 
 Now there's a westerly breeze 
 Please, I need help with the zephyr 
 You could knock me down with a feather 
 But I'll still be grinning with the mouth of a Cheshire 
 My last album was a hell of an effort 
 Daniel wrote the manual on how to endeavour 
 And if ever there was a doubt that I'm clever 
 It's down to the fact that my talent's without measure 
 I've found treasure now my business is pleasure 
 I can infinitely tessellate my lyrics at leisure 
 And any way you spin it, it just gets fresher 
 An intricately illustrating MC... Escher 
 The quiet viking is how I'm known, I 
 I'm strident in style, although shy 
 And I don't even know why 
 So I'm either enlightened or I'm just so high 
 I can see the lighting upon the roadside 
 Driving over the strobe light 
 The quiet viking 
 The quiet viking
