Never mind a Rolex, I got my Pip-Boy 
 And I'm ready to make some 
 Capital in the capital 
 Look, ever since they dropped 
 The atomic bomb 
 You've been hold up in Vault 101 
 And since your momma's gone 
 You focused on abilities 
 Perception, endurance, intelligence, agility 
 Your skill in these categories is clear 
 And apparently you'll be needed 
 And since your daddy's disappeared 
 Now you're a big boy 
 Got your own Pip-Boy 
 What you need to succeed 
 Is a pistol to destroy 
 Anyone who's dumb enough 
 To look for trouble over here 
 I've had it up to here 
 With the fuckin' Overseer 
 Kill him or go with stealth 
 Don't let nobody see it 
 Now you're overground and out 
 And the coast is clear 
 Here, a wild frontier 
 Is what we see 
 A post-apocalyptic Washington D.C. 
 You should be headin' on whatever the direction 
 If you're a clever one you'll be visitin' Megaton 
 You'll meet the residents 
 And the Sheriff Lucas Simms 
 Now you can help him out or end up shootin' him 
 This sort of drama can cause your karma to diminish 
 But you do what you need to 
 When you choose to win 
 It's law of the Wasteland 
 So all of you wastemans oughtta stay back 
 And get a tool face abd when I pull out my strap 
 And activate the V.A.T.S. 
 There's no way that 
 I'll let these twats escape the blast 
 I'll blaze away but the way my 
 Rants are raising fast 
 A super mutant high on Psycho couldn't take my ass! 
 I've never seen a blade of grass, this place is shit 
 So I need to locate the Garden of Eden Creation Kit 
 But before I do that, man 
 It's time for action I have got to find the balance 
 In between the rival fractions 
 The battle's gettin' hyperactive 
 Radioactive, Reilly's Rangers, Talons and the savage Raiders 
 Packed in conflict with the Enclave 
 Crushin' Us under the heel 
 But I keep it bloody real 
 With the Brotherhood of Steel 
 We're heading for the war to end all wars 
 Not to mention all the sentry bots 
 Centaurs and deathclaws 
 You best pack a deadly force 
 Or you'll end up gettin' in more 
 If you think that just a stimpak is plenty for 
 Level up, get better heavy weapons and perks 
 'Cause no matter hard you are there's an enemy worse 
 Ladadadada 
 It's the motherfuckin' D.A.W.G. 
 Three Dog! 
 Ladadadada 
 I'm on the radio in Fallout 3 
 You better make your way to Rivet City 
 And speak to Doctor Li 
 About Project Purity 
 When you installed John Henry's FEV 
 Or will you connect the GECK and set the people free?
