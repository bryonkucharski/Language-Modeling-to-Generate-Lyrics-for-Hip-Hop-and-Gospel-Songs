Somewhere along the way, I lost my aim 
 Somewhere along the way, I lost my aim 
 Somewhere along the way, I lost my aim 
 I struggle along in vain, just to not quite make it 
 It's late at night, I'm awake, surprise surprise 
 Trying to find some kind of way to write 
 It's a shame, I fail to find a blatant line 
 Between original art and what's plagiarised 
 It's vague and effectively makes playing a fresh 
 Melody impossible, I often wanna lay it to rest 
 I say with regret 'cause I love making music 
 Taking beautiful soothing sounds to make tunes with 
 Creating a groove and arranging and looping it 
 But usually it screws me straight up, I feel stupid 
 I need a tea break to replace my fuses 
 But my main mistake is that I keep making excuses 
 The truth is I can blatantly do this 
 But my brain just refuses to obey so I lose it 
 Thus making me choose to take painkillers and booze 
 Just to change up my mood plus maybe induce 
 A thrust of creative boost to raise me up from this place of wasted youth 
 And enable me to embrace my muse 
 Taste the fruits of the great musical roots 
 That grew from the days of slaves playing the blues 
 Somewhere along the way, I lost my aim 
 It's come and it's gone again I've lost my aim 
 Somewhere along the way, I lost my aim 
 My colour is gone and drained, I just might faint 
 So hold me so tight 
 Make me feel alive 
 Blocked out, locked out 
 Please, please, please not now 
 To find the right line to write's quite a painful paper chase 
 Sometimes it takes ages, other days I get it straight away 
 That's the main way I ever can create 
 But take away my aspirations and my brain's a vacant place 
 I hesitate for days in an attempt to make a serenade 
 And say something amazing to set the grade in clever ways 
 But fate never plays fair therefore I'll stay this way forever 
 Never creating till the end of days 
 Seven eighths of the time when I'm trying 
 To think of a lyric, picture an image or write a nice rhyme 
 I'm willing my mind to fill up with brilliant ideas 
 Bring them to life, like they were written in my tears 
 I fear it's quite clear I'm living a lie here 
 Eyes dried up but I wish I could cry, hear 
 Is this a signal or sign my mind's fucked up? 
 'Cause if isn't I'm just blocked 
 Blocked out, locked out 
 Please, please, please not now 
 Something is wrong today, I'm not quite sane 
 Suddenly dropped from grace, and lost my train
