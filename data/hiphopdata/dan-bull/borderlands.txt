We are off to the Moon and it's 
 Full of Lunitics with a new bag of tricks 
 This place needs luminous lick of paint while I'm doin' this shi 
 Comin' through on a humorous tip 
 Then I switch from a clown to the brutalest prick 
 Getting through many clips 
 So my trigger fingers superhumanly ripped 
 Is there room in the Inn for a Lawbringer? 
 Enforcing enforcers to forcefully pick up a fork and nick your dinner? 
 Give some applause, I'm a pure winner 
 I'm a mixture of helpful and selfish 
 Marshal and Elvis, shark and a shellfish 
 Armed amour, and well fit, can't help it 
 I'm departing to Elpis 
 Everything's going all wobbly 
 I'mma find a pile of scrap to mash up in a grinder 
 Camp on a cliff and snipe ya 
 I'm a larger brain matter collider 
 Smashing up atoms and splattering minds up 
 No wonder that I have to remind you that 
 Hang one a second, what's that just behind you? 
 Got you in the botty with a shotty 
 Now your as a Nosh from a Rotty 
 Not rocky but I'll knock you out with my noccas 
 Gnocchi, out with your knockers 
 Moxxii, she's so hot I'm hot by Proxy 
 And Athena, have you seen her? 
 That Gladiator doesn't need an arena 
 Tell them Tiny Tina, just what she does 
 To my wiener's demeanor. 
 Could I even be keener if she switched my decaf creamer 
 For a Cleavland Steamer, I'm an eager beaver 
 Too bloody sweet for a tea with sweetener 
 I launch VaultHunter.exe, so Doom you can keep your BFG, sir 
 Don't need that to leave your face looking like a piece of pizza 
 When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, that's a ball ache 
 When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, that's a ball ache 
 To the moon and back 
 To the moon and back, back, back 
 To the moon and back 
 To the moon and back, back, back 
 To the moon and back 
 To the moon and back, back, back 
 To the moon and back 
 To the moon and back, back, back 
 He's a bastard, Handsome Jack 
 Keep the cash, have your ransom back 
 Him and dastardly plans get together 
 Like France and Jacques Chirac 
 'Cause this is what happens when twats attack 
 And if you answer back, then I'll clamp our trap 
 Fancy that, I'm a Dandy Dan, a fancy man in a fancy hat! 
 Claptrap hits hard and as hard as a clap track 
 On a no limit record clap track 
 If it moves, I'll frag that, bring it down like the NASDAQ 
 With my arsenal, I'm tear aparting all 
 Grammar Nazis that start a war 
 I don't want to boast, but I'm rather awe inspiring 
 When I'm flingin' bars galore 
 Hit with a critical? Typical, I told you shit'd get physical 
 Clips galore but I piss them all away in your face 
 Shoot anything from a brute to a cute bunny 
 Loot like a gold digger with a new hubby 
 Now I can't fit into my suit, 'cause I'm too tubby 
 That pile of sands glitched, is the dune buggy? 
 To the moon and back 
 To the moon and back, back, back 
 To the moon and back 
 To the moon and back, back, back 
 To the moon and back 
 To the moon and back, back, back 
 To the moon and back 
 To the moon and back, back, back
