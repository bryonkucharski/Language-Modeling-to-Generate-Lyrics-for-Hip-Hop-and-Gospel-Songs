"A cup of Fairy Ale isn't much if not accompanied 
 By some bardic poems and songs" 
 For a thousand years, the battle has been waged 
 But there's strange tidings, the tides of war are sure to change 
 We live in sinister times, there's an imminent fight 
 Bigger than Kyle's mom, have you seen her behind? 
 A hero will rise, he needs to be wise 
 And Jews can't be saviours, so it's best he isn't circumcised 
 There's whisperings around these parts of a new kid 
 There's a house on Fuller Street that they say he moved in 
 I hear tell he's a muteling, he doesn't speak much 
 It has nothing to do with the game's pre-release budget 
 We need a saviour greater than the Dragonborn 
 Let me consult my magic tome stashed away within this stack of porn 
 There's Cartman, Grand Wizard ruling Kupa Keep 
 Where you can barter, buy some armour or just find some food to eat 
 This is the tent in which we kept the Stick of Truth but see 
 Clyde had one job, and he messed it up quite stupidly 
 And so now, new kid, it's up to you to seek 
 And return the Stick to its place to break the losing streak 
 Let us proceed in this hour of darkness 
 With the courage of dragons and the power of fart mist 
 Through towers and arches, we scour the territories 
 Whether showers or fire pits, disembowel our enemies 
 The sourest hardships will never defeat our people 
 We keep releasing lethal farts that are without equal 
 An ancient secret: the Nagasaki Fart 
 Leave you with a bleeding nose and looking like you party hard 
 With such an epic quest, you need a band of merry men 
 To dig up buried treasure chests and see you to the very end 
 Butters is a Paladin, Stan's a Warrior with A.D. 
 Kenny is a Princess, don't ask why, that's how he's rolling lately 
 And Kyle finally acknowledges his true self 
 As he transmutes into the form of a High Jew Elf 
 So go forth now, blow the war horn 
 I will stay and guard the Keep and maybe look at more porn 
 Use your power shrewdly or never see your enemy fall 
 Because one does not simply fart on anyone's balls 
 Battle Underpants Gnomes, Goblins and Vampire Kids 
 The town relies on you to undo that which has been did 
 In you we trust, I've prophesied your destiny 
 Put an end to evil in the nuts like a vasectomy
