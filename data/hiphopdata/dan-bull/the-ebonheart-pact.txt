From Black Marsh, we are Argonians 
 Other breeds act harsh, treat us as lowly 'uns 
 We've been cursed, trodden into the dirt 
 So we developed a thick skin, there's little can hurt us 
 And when it does, we're the best at Restoration 
 Quick to mend, assist a friend to get to destinations 
 Never raise voices, forever stay moist 
 In the everglade place, we settled and made choices 
 Never been considered as a master race 
 But then we're quick to switch and adapt to change 
 It isn't an idiom when we say we're amphibian 
 Fill a ditch with a bit of liquid and we live in them 
 There's no bigger mystery than our history 
 Shrouded under visions in the shadow of the Hist tree 
 We're pale, vicious, what ails you, we resist 
 Witness our tails flick as we hail Sithis 
 So never start spats with the Ebonheart Pact 
 Or you'll never ever, ever get your severed arm back 
 Whether you are governed by your head or heart that 
 Is irrelevant when battling the Ebonheart Pact 
 I said never start spats with the Ebonheart Pact 
 Or you'll never ever, ever get your severed arm back 
 Whether you are governed by your head or heart that 
 Is irrelevant when battling the Ebonheart Pact 
 We are the Dark Elves, tackle every task well 
 Nobody can casts spells quite as well as ourselves 
 Breaking through your hard shells, taking you to half health 
 The greatest of the fables and the tales that the bard tells 
 We're in pursuit of a higher truth 
 And we'll chase it through flames, that's why they made us fireproof 
 Some say we're quite aloof but our race just might produce 
 The one to execute the Daedra and tie the noose 
 Nothing'll touch you just as tragic as Destruction magic 
 Ramp it up to maximum then cast to make you rushed and panicked 
 Crushed and damaged, this isn't just an anecdote 
 Our mana flows up so savage 
 We'll leave your head pounding, leaking like a fountain 
 Blood coming down like lava from the Red Mountain 
 To underestimate the Dunmer's a direct mistake 
 You'll be torn asunder, plundered and then left to fate 
 So never start spats with the Ebonheart Pact 
 Or you'll never ever, ever get your severed arm back 
 Whether you are governed by your head or heart that 
 Is irrelevant when battling the Ebonheart Pact 
 I said never start spats with the Ebonheart Pact 
 Or you'll never ever, ever get your severed arm back 
 Whether you are governed by your head or heart that 
 Is irrelevant when battling the Ebonheart Pact 
 We are the Nords, we're bringing hordes 
 Banging on the big drums to ringing chords 
 Singing war choruses, swinging swords 
 Killing all sorts of Orcs and winning wars 
 In the beginning was a civil war in the north 
 Land of Atmora, the warlord Ysgramor 
 Brought us to the shores of an old cold continent 
 Confident we'd conquer it, we conquered it with confidence 
 Skyrim was ours now, as it shall ever be 
 For we are the fiercest warriors you'll ever see 
 With our two-handed weapon expertise 
 We're rugged and robust, you look featherweight next to these 
 Combat's a long-lasting state of ecstasy 
 Bring any weapon that you want, you'll never get the best of me 
 No-one but the Eight Divines could ever set my destiny 
 Many men have tried it, now many rest in peace 
 So never start spats with the Ebonheart Pact 
 Or you'll never ever, ever get your severed arm back 
 Whether you are governed by your head or heart that 
 Is irrelevant when battling the Ebonheart Pact 
 I said never start spats with the Ebonheart Pact 
 Or you'll never ever, ever get your severed arm back 
 Whether you are governed by your head or heart that

 No one but the Eight Divines could ever set my destiny

 No one but the Eight Divines could ever set my destiny
