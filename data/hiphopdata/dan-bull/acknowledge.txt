I am a bit of a difficult hypocritical prick 
 Who'll always get into a pickle, but the sins I commit 
 Are all above board; this is for everyone I've got love for 
 Who helped me up through the window by the shut doors 
 Pulled strings, untangled the web, and cut cords 
 And if you didn't assist this, then up yours 
 My business is to give hits to kids 
 That have been amiss from the industry hit list 
 This flow's for those who were bullied in school 
 You'll grow to show those tools that they don't rule 
 This is for those who are bullies in school 
 You'll realise you can be nice and fully cool 
 Some of us look back at that as the worst days 
 Others still suffer that exact crap in the workplace 
 From virgins that never had a first date 
 To unwanted babies that never had a birthday 
 This is for single moms, working three jobs 
 To keep your sprog in the Reeboks that he wants 
 This rap's for single dads, fighting to see their kids 
 Crying, thinking if they even understand he exists 
 I've set the controls for the heart and the soul 
 Of those whose woes have hardly been told 
 Too many hearts of gold are treated like pyrite 
 So it's high time I tried to set this bias right 
 Feeling low? My lines'll leave your hopes high as kites 
 Incite delight like a cherry bright sky at night 
 This vocal's for locals who are frightened in their neighbourhood 
 Refrain from leaving home at night; afraid of violent raping muggers 
 For the same buggers doing crime to pay for drugs 
 It never meant to end this way, you're stuck; pain sucks 
 Change looks like something that'll never happen 
 But if I let that thinking win, I'd never end up rapping 
 For those in prison, those who did and those who didn't 
 The victims that they did it to and those who witnessed it 
 For those who overcome their hopeless bitterness to show forgiveness 
 Whether you do or don't is no one's business 
 For those who wish to string them up until they know their miseries 
 Life's a winding hillside road and the slope is slippery 
 For the people upon the picket lines 
 Miners who down their pick and strike 
 Strive for a different life 
 For the silent majority, 
 Tightening your waistline to prop up an economy 
 You probably hadn't a problem with till the bottom dropped off of it 
 But now you're picking up the tab and haven't got a tip 
 This is for the elderly, sitting in their chairs alone 
 Or bedridden in a bug ridden nursing home 
 A verse devoted to you, and who you truly are 
 The same you that you've ever been, I've seen you shoot for the stars 
 But gravity ravages things savagely 
 So let my lyrics lift your spirits up from incapacity 
 'Cause I'm the captain of this flagship actually 
 And you're a VIP invited to fly the galaxy with me 
 This is for the carers, looking after another 
 I understand you want to be more than just a mother 
 How can you have a lover, or any other life 
 If you couldn't find someone else to come and grab the cover? 
 Changing a duvet's much easier with two, hey? 
 Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday 
 For those stuck at home, chronic illness, health problems 
 A lot of guilt makes you want to kill yourself often 
 What little help I can offer to soften the blow? 
 Can't invent anything off of the top of the dome 
 But you've not been forgotten and I just want you to know 
 Wherever you are, my flow will boldly go 
 I swear by the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost 
 Jehovah, Allah, Muhammad, whoever holds the most 
 Control over the souls of the unappreciated 
 It will keep ebbing away every day that people play this shit 
 I try to recognise 
 Those who've been left aside 
 Come aboard my enterprise, and boldly 
 I try to recognise 
 Those who've been left aside 
 Come aboard my enterprise, and boldly
