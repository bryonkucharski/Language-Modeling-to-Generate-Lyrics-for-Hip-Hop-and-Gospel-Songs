I'll get in my submarine 
 Set sail to somewhere remote 
 I'll wait until World War III is over 
 Then go and live with the victors and 
 Sing 
 Sing 
 My catharsis 
 Look, never again will I put down my pen 
 The best method I know to let stuff out my head 
 Yes, I'm aware of the notion I must sound a bit dense 
 But I'm just letting you know there's nothing round to contend 
 When stressed then I focus on jotting down a lament 
 Introspectively composing what comes out from within 
 Whenever you feel hopeless, down, depressed 
 I suggest getting a note book out and venting 
 Whether wrecked or sober muck round with the text 
 Get depression focused, confront the doubt and dread 
 Instead of letting them roam or shutting them out your head 
 Don't ever repress emotions, push them down, pretending 
 You never noticed them sucking you down to death 
 You could suffer a thousand deaths together alone 
 Getting ever more low till you couldn't get up out of bed 
 So yes, my best weapon's prose, and I'll love sound to def 
 My catharsis 
 Sometimes you need to sit and vent your heart 
 Even if there's a fair chance some prick'll tear it apart 
 But I don't care, it's a farce 
 So I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve eager to share it with half 
 Of the people that care when I start with my speech 
 Harp through my teeth 
 About seemingly meaningless things mithering me 
 And I mean it's difficult to say what's really on your brain 
 Without thinking what friends think of your frame of mind 
 'Cause they might think you're a little bit insane 
 But if you wanna break from the cycle of pain 
 Then you might wanna change up your mind and its frame 
 You're neither to blame nor liable for saying 
 Any lines on a page that's inscribed with your name 
 They're right when they say pen's mightier than sword 
 So remember that fact then write and record 
 My catharsis
