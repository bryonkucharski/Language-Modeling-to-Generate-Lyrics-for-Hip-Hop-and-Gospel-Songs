Michael 
 Yeah, my name is Michael, landed and titled 
 Think of a crime and it probably was my fault 
 But now I cleaned up my act, call me Lysol 
 I used to pull off heists then I got out of the cycle 
 I wasn't stopping till I got the bills 
 For a property in Rockford Hills 
 But now I rock the mils and the mansion 
 Looking for the answers at the bottom of a bottle 
 As I pop the pills, for reals 
 I live a life of luxury but trust me, I'm the man it sucks to be 
 Look and see, my family's dysfunctional 
 Sometimes I feel like I really want to punch 'em all 
 My son's a ball of blubber, about as awful as my daughter 
 Or her mother, or her mother's other lover, motherfucker 
 Suffering a midlife crisis, but have you seen how ridiculous my wife is? 
 You shouldn't be surprised what the mind of a man does 
 To hide from the madness of Amanda's 
 Even my analyst is struggling to handle this 
 So it's about time I went back to being the protagonist 
 There's only one philosophy I follow 
 And that's the mighty American dollar 
 There's only one philosophy I follow 
 And that's the mighty American dollar 
 Franklin 
 Yo, they call me Franklin, I'm all about the Benjamins 
 I spend on anything that's got a revving engine in 
 I never had a family, except my gang and me 
 I was educated at the Hard Knock Academy 
 But gang banging was an absolute calamity 
 They handcuffed and chucked me in the slammer, it was agony 
 Now I'm free, being a repo man is my reality 
 But on this salary I can't afford a calorie 
 And as I can't gather enough food to eat 
 From Vespucci Beach, then I might resort to felony 
 Felling an enemy or anyone offending me 
 Befriending people who inevitably will depend on me 
 But if I end up in a feud with Lamar 
 I'll lick off his top, like a Cuban cigar 
 I'm the dude with the car, a superstar 
 In a street fight I'll pull off a hadouken, rah 
 You might find me in the strip club, bruh 
 But I didn't come to get my dick sucked, nah 
 I'm a hip hop star, Blood? Crip? Not moi 
 I'm the top dog, sit, Chop, ha 
 It's like this 
 It's like this 
 Look 
 There's only one philosophy I follow 
 And that's the mighty American dollar 
 There's only one philosophy I follow 
 And that's the mighty American dollar 
 Trevor 
 Nah, my name is Trevor 
 I live inside a trailer in the desert, where I blaze the crystal method 
 This unhygienic lifestyle only takes a little effort 
 But the cash I had I've gone and wasted it, I'm reckless 
 I haven't got a pound to my name 
 So it's time to get out of the County of Blaine 
 I used to fly a plane, now I just fry my brain 
 Howling at the moon, you can assume that I'm insane 
 Like my neighbour Ron, I don't know what page he's on 
 Paranoid conspiracies, I really believe his brain is gone 
 Any plan I make, something has to spoil it 
 I can't fit this fucking foot down the toilet 
 I've got a penchant for throttling a pensioner 
 Then grabbing a can of petrol and notching up the temperature 
 I've got a nervous twitch that's quite violent 
 So I'm doing suicidal stunts in my Y-fronts 
 I fell out with Michael, we never quite saw 
 Eyeball to eyeball, but now it's time for 
 Us to reunite, grab the shotties and the rifles 
 And set the town alight in a giant fireball 
 There's only one philosophy I follow 
 And that's the mighty American dollar 
 There's only one philosophy I follow 
 And that's the mighty American dollar 
 Michael, Franklin & Trevor 
 Yo, the three of us are so grand thefting 
 The best in the biz, no damn question 
 Man it's sexy, straddling a jet ski 
 Ramming it at jet speed, get me? 
 What you doing in our neck of the woods? 
 You best be checking the HUD 
 'Cause in a second your blood will be flecking the mud 
 When we bust you by the lip 
 Take all your money and then customize a whip 
 How can we justify this shit? We must be kind of sick 
 That's why we keep the piece that's the most trusty by the hip 
 So pull the map out while we pull the strap out 
 Pow pow, till the popo go and black out 
 Dropping from the chopper then we grab a couple hostages 
 We're hot dog sausages 
 We trade stocks and cribs, take shots at pricks 
 Bury their heads in the dirt, ostriches 
 The unholy trinity in your vicinity 
 Sinning with a seriously symbiotic synergy 
 We're the three similarly sinister G's 
 Each sending the cinema screen into the cemetery 
 Cynically with no sympathy seen 
 So simmer down and listen to this symphony please 
 To put it simply, police, are just some pimply sleazes 
 We'll pimp as we please and so we send them to sleep 
 Yes 
 There's only one philosophy we follow 
 And that's the mighty American dollar 
 There's only one philosophy we follow 
 And that's the mighty American dollar
