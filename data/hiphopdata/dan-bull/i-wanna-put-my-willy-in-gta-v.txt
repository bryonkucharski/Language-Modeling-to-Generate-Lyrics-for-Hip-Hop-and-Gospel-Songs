I hopped onto the net today 
 Saw a link to the trailer for 
 GTA 
 So straight away I pressed play 
 In wait to be blown away 
 I saw a couple walk 
 Through the mist on the beach 
 The pink light blissfully sweet 
 You could instantly see 
 The emission of heat 
 The sand on your feet 
 And wind from the sea 
 Joggers run past on the promenade 
 Then the camera pans up long and hard 
 There's no mistakin' it 
 From the palms in the valley 
 We're in L.A. 
 GTA: San Andreas 
 A familiar name to the badass players 
 But as beautiful as it is 
 It could use a couple of clips 
 Of gore galore 
 A smorgasbord of footage 
 Of Bloods and Crips 
 Popping some clips 
 That was one of the best things 
 Hey, is that Carlton 
 From 
 The Fresh Prince 
 ? 
 Loads of peeps on the hard streets 
 But no sign of a car thief 
 My God, I hope I get to actually 
 Drive a wind turbine 
 Sweet! 
 I couldn't give a fuck for a crop duster 
 I want to hit a cop 
 With a knuckle duster 
 Don't psychoanalyze me 
 In real life, I'm quite nice, see? 
 I see Tai Chi and exterminators 
 Have replaced Hot Coffee like a percolator 
 Not rock climbing and a driving range 
 Let's see more signs of guys in pain 
 I want an overload of action shots 
 Those moments happen lots 
 And are why we play 
 GTA 
 Everyday and simply cannot stop 
 Hahaha! 
 Grand Theft Auto V 
 Grand Theft Auto V 
 Oh, isn't it exciting?
