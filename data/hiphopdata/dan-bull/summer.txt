Some of the happiest days are when the sun rays cascade 
 Over your back in the most naturally placid of ways 
 You don't have to ask whether perhaps it'll rain 
 And the centigrade never strays past twenty eight 
 It's fantastically great kicking back with your mates 
 And knowing no, you don't have to act to your age 
 You can snack on a Flake or take a basket of cakes 
 But make sure you've got some factor eight splashed on your face 
 And the ladies make daisies attached in a chain 
 While the lads entertain them with a basketball game 
 And then after we're knackered and the match has been played 
 Grab a glass of lemonade and relax in the shade 
 We'll bask and just laze in the grass's green blades 
 And sit back and just gaze at the paths of the planes 
 Nothing matters today, you can chatter and play 
 Playful antics under blankets of immaculate haze 
 Once upon a summer 
 The sun plays across the lawn 
 Once upon a summer 
 The air is sweet and warm 
 Once upon a summer 
 Heavenly and calm 
 Once upon a summer 
 It's never been this fun 
 It's ace when you're tipsy and playing with a frisbee 
 There ain't been better days in the pages of history 
 And though your hay fever itches and makes you be sniffly 
 It's blatantly plain that you'll savour and miss these 
 Great times when they're gone, days lying in the sun 
 Bathing, misbehaving and playfighting for fun 
 They might have been some of the days of your life that you'll always 
 Be reminded of when your time to pass away finally comes 
 And as the day becomes night and the sun goes down 
 The shadows grow slow and cloak round your home town 
 There's no sound but the bees and the birds 
 And slowly but certainly the season returns 
 You turn down to the ground and there's leaves on the earth 
 Turning brown and allowing the trees to rebirth 
 There's a breeze in the air and it breathes through your hair 
 And that's it - summer leaves for the year 
 Summer's come and gone 
 The day's no longer young 
 Summer's come and gone 
 But the memory lives on
