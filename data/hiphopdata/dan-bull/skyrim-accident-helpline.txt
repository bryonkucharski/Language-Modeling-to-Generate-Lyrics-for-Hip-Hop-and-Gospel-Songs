 But I took an arrow to the knee" 
 "I was right in a dungeon, with my companion 
 When he carelessly stepped on a pressure plate 
 And I was smashed in the face 
 With a spiky metal grid 
 I had to spend two weeks off work 
 Recoverin' in the Temple of Kynareth" 
 "I was in the middle of an epic battle 
 With a frost dragon 
 When I slipped on an icy patch it had made 
 And grazed my shin"
