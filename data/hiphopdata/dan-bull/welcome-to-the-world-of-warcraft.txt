 Look, you're looking at the biggest beast in Warcraft 
 Armor way stronger than the steel that your sword has 
 Sharper than the claws of every demon you've encountered 
 And I'm known for burning legions, since no one matches my power 
 Blood spills, I get the taste for fun 
 Pop flyer than a Harpy you'll be leaving as a faceless one 
 Will I rule this world, no doubt, one day 
 'Cause I'm way sicker than the Corrupted Blood Plague 
 Planetary burner, igniting all your servers 
 The bull's running with me, your only options to serve us 
 The moment players heard us, they've bowed at the auras 
 Without the need of combat and honestly it bores us 
 'Cause no one comes close to a smidgen of my strength 
 No race no faction, no one's shortening the length 
 Of time I'll be sitting on my throne, try? I'll split you 
 You'll be swimming with the fishes, floating with the Jinyu's 
 You're nothing but a gnome, what's a Dwarf to a Dragon? 
 Nothing but an insect, a fly I'll get to smackin' 
 Standing twice as tall as a Magnataur, savage boss 
 The biggest threat to ever be spawned in Azeroth 
 The more that I reign, the more I get colder 
 Executing everything from Imps to Ogres 
 Voidwalkers, Trolls, every part of the Forsaken 
 Every treasure in the world is mine for the taking 
 Every human in the game and those at their computer screen 
 Better take note that tyranny ain't new to me 
 A demigod but I'm far from Cenarius 
 The Dryads took note of that, and so they stay far from us 
 My only alliance is with Dan, get in line 
 For the slaughter that we're bringing forth, it worsens as time 
 Goes by, so say your goodbyes, no matter the amount 
 'Cause after this moment, you're losing you account

 Dan Bull 
 Thank you, Shizzy, holla 
 I'm the Asher Roth of Azeroth, watch a man with Valor mock you 
 To abyssal depths amid the hellfire I ran amok 
 I live on got it on lock mode, Dan's hit a crossroads 
 I take a dollar and change it to a million, I've got loads 
 I go hard, I'm not just rock hard, I'm stone hard 
 Flow hard, oh no, there are more blowhards 
 I'm a bard that's assured to make you laugh 
 Ask Mike Tyson what type of fuel you put in a car? "Gath" 
 While other stars rest in Beverly Hills 
 Brad Pitt's polar opposite sits developing skills 
 You're acting silly, thus I spit with venom, spite 
 And more vocal gadgets than Iron Man while you're a Mennonite 
 Eminem consults me for advice, I'm Marshall's refuge 
 Point in case: I told him if he'd get rude, he'd get huge 
 I said a clever song would sell when beats are banging 
 Man, I love giant sub basslines and a grand piano 
 And I sure watch a lot of twerk clips on YouTube today 
 I love thunder-clapping buns, show me that booty, bae 
 But when the storm peaks don't let the thunder mar 
 The wrinkles of grimmer things swinging in your bra's underwire 
 With all those ratchet hoes acting gross, don't they actually know 
 About Venereal Disease? They could be catching loads 
 I roll with practice, the fact is it makes a tighter joint 
 I don't vote for UKIP but I see Nigel's point 
 Listen chum, I come from brum, a panned area 
 But it's brill, and is where Tolkien lived, man, where are you? 
 So take your gangsta clichés and all that junk back 
 I don't own a single gun to necessitate a gun rack 
 But after my hammer falls you'll feel the sword of vengeance 
 Landing on you like a thousand needles 
 String you up and left you hanging by a thread 
 See the blood, watch it trickle down 
 Amidst the mist, I've buried more bears than a fricking triple town 
 My rhymes are dark, sure, well out of the suns reach 
 To the point where the dusk would be some relief 
 I'll do a thirty two bar verse on thumping beats 
 But some of you don't ever look and see the puns beneath 
 I've never let a failed conquest hold me under see 
 My domination points to genius with every tumbling leaf 
 Rap's lumberjack, I fell wood but when I splinter tree 
 Post traumatic stress flows into me 
 Cold and fresh as a winter spring, what can I do for a song? 
 I'm sure by now you've got an inkling 
 I've got to win, to hold the honor, grasp it tight 
 I grow old and see the west fall before I waive control of the mic
