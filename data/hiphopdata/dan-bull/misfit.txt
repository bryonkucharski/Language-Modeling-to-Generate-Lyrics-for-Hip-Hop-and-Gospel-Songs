Oh, sod it, it hurts but I'll reveal the truth 
 Sometimes I'd like to curl up and be a recluse 
 I mean it, it isn't simply an excuse 
 I'm really feeling too weak to deal with you 
 Do you see what I've been reduced to? 
 A shadow of myself with the bleakest future 
 I zone out, open myself 
 And only hope someone else knows what I'm about 
 It's lonely when you've felt so low you can't help 
 But want to go for broke, and throw in the towel 
 Go to the cabinet, open the tablets 
 Overdose and lay comatose in the bath with the tap running 
 That's not what I planned when I had hope though 
 I once was the man in the photo 
 Laughing with no load on my back and no hassle 
 And the path to my happiness, that was still open 
 In the past had I known that all that was over 
 Perhaps I'd have known how to claw back those years 
 I was sober, no drugs, I had a girlfriend 
 But now I'm a loner that hopes the world ends 
 How did I fall into all this torment 
 I never portended this result then 
 I wanted four kids, a mortgage, a crib with all the fittings 
 But all I'm getting's more bored and morbid 
 According to laws of physics actions all cause others 
 Yeah? So howcome I don't have some sort of lover? 
 It's all just rubbish, all religions and philosophical offerings 
 Of knowledge on the source of our suffering 
 It's just a thing thought up by people who lie to deceive 
 All the world to lie at their feet 
 So I'm actually beginning to believe 
 That perhaps it's time for me to leave 
 'Cause I'm a misfit - I'm not an alpha male 
 Misfit - my health's too frail 
 I'm a misfit - worn out and pale 
 Misfit - I'm bound to fail 
 I'm a misfit - your inane conversation 
 Misfit - puts a strain on my patience 
 I'm a misfit - please take me away from all 
 Misfit - this pain and frustration 
 I'm a misfit 
 Do I freak you out with what I speak about? 
 Like I'm not even allowed to reveal myself 
 'Cause it breaches how people seem to chat 
 It seems they really don't want to hear the real Dan 
 But piss off, I'm just not interested in small talk 
 I'd much more discuss thoughts on Bush, war and such 
 All the fuss all you fucks all get flustered with football 
 Means fuck all to me 'cause it's just sport, and that's all 
 Don't you ever sit and think about the bigger things 
 And how to figure things out that aren't just physical? 
 The little bit of history we fit into 
 How we're writ into it, and what it means to us 
 I feel I don't ever belong, what a misfit 
 But see, don't get me wrong, I'm not a thick kid 
 Cross my fingers, I've got witnesses of this 
 I think it's some kind of condition or sickness 
 That inhibits my ability to fit in with hip kids 
 Sit and sip drinks without feeling ridiculous 
 Is there something I've missed, is this all just a trick? 
 Can you all just admit that you're being pricks 
 For shits and giggles? It itches and niggles 
 This list of questions, riddles and things 
 That fill my head and inner sense with visions of maliciousness 
 With this malevolence I'm stripped of my innocence 
 The pinnacle thing beginning my wishlist's 
 A vision in which I'm just hindered with less stress 
 So if I sink into and addiction and alcoholism 
 Can I be forgiven for wishing to skip this 
 Abyss of decisions? This piteous pit 
 Full of pissy and shit citizens 
 'Cause if this planet I've seen's the epitome of existence 
 Then shit, you can literally sit and spin on it 
 I'm a misfit - I'm not an alpha male 
 Misfit - my health's too frail 
 I'm a misfit - worn out and pale 
 Misfit - I'm bound to fail 
 I'm a misfit - your inane conversation 
 Misfit - puts a strain on my patience 
 I'm a misfit - please take me away from all 
 Misfit - this pain and frustration 
 'Cause if this planet I've seen's the epitome of existence 
 Then shit, you can literally sit and spin on it
