Yeah, I'm Vito Sceleta 
 When it comes to being a G there's no one better 
 I'm a vet straight fresh out of Operation Husky 
 Put my life on the line but the state doesn't trust me 
 I came out of Italy, specifically Sicily 
 Till I shipped in with the immigrants to the Big City, live gritty 
 Had a hard start but still we party hard and sing ditties 
 Living large, drinking with them broads with the big titties 
 But when you're living big you tend to run up debts 
 And clearing credit here's not a case of signing another cheque 
 We deal with suitcases stuffed with banknotes 
 And debt collectors who aren't too shy to shank throats 
 When there's money to pay, you better pay, prick 
 And if you can't make it, you better take it 
 'Cause if you have to twist an arm, you may as well break it 
 Get in the fucking car, you're getting taken on a day trip 
 In a city that won't sleep, we live the American Dream 
 And in a city that won't sleep, we live the American Dream 
 If it's God that has made man, then a made man is God 
 (Amen) 
 If it's God that has made man, then a made man is God 
 (Amen) 
 I'm a Mafia don, stacking the funds 
 Trying to hold me back, what kind of crack are you on? 
 I roll with a Beretta .38 and my friend, Joe 
 But I know we're all alone in the end though 
 Every road leads there, no need to go dead slow 
 So speed up because I said so 
 Or be left in the red glow of the tail lights 
 Life's a driving test and you can't fail twice 
 Ain't going back to jail, you can inhale on my tail pipe 
 Make no mistake, I'm running the Bay 
 If you've something to say 
 I'll aim my submachine gun and then spray 
 A man of grand ambitions but still I'm humble and pray 
 Hungry to take over, never done for the day 
 I came reluctantly into the Underworld 
 Tried to play it straight but it sucked me back in 
 Guess I'm not done with the girl 
 So I made a date with fate and aimed to take everything I could 
 And till I end up in Satan's flames, it's never been as good 
 In a city that won't sleep, we live the American Dream 
 And in a city that won't sleep, we live the American Dream 
 If it's God that has made man, then a made man is God 
 If it's God that has made man, then a made man is God
