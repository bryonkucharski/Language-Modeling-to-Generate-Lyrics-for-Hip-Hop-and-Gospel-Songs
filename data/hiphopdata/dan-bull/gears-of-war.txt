(Dead Man Walkn) 
 Emergence day emergency, thunder sounded 
 And a hundred thousand locust rose up from underground 
 The invasion managed to create a manic state of panic 
 They did damage and it made a devastated planet 
 Today was savage, the latest in a spate of clashes 
 Between invader and remains of man that came from ashes 
 See Marcus Fenix in Jacinto Penitentiary 
 Dominic Santiago enters then he sets him free 
 To defend against the horde he brought all sorts of awesome weaponry 
 Bring all your forces forward, your corpser's dead to me 
 Him and Dom find Kim and Carmine and together they took 
 A look around for Alpha Squad to get the resonator 
 A sniper snipes Carmine right in the head and later 
 They catch the Cole Train and press on the accelerator 
 Seeders block the transmission, nearly stopped the damn mission 
 Is that the Hammer of Dawn that Dom is brandishing? 
 Every soldier's ambition is to fire one, a line of lightning 
 Striking right in from the sky, you're gone 
 Look, there's Baird and a couple of redshirts, hmm 
 I wonder which one of them will be dead first? 
 It can't be Kim, can it? that man's put in the legwork 
 Ooh, feckin' heck, I bet his bloody head hurt 
 Now Fenix has seen this and he's pissed in extremist 
 But needs to just retreat quick lest he gets in deep shit 
 It's certainly evident he is ready to burn an effigy 
 But there is a mercenary Berzerker lurking 
 In the murk of every turn you step in 
 One of the perks of military work is getting 
 To murder every enemy ever so cleverly 
 With the heaviest weaponry 
 Boom, hooah, we are the Gears of War 
 Come on and ask us what the motherfuck we're here for 
 Boom, hooah, we are the Gears of War 
 Come on and ask us what the motherfuck we're here for 
 As the planet plummets ever further into instability 
 The Gears receive a missive of massive responsibility 
 To take the resonator, in the face of all futility 
 And place it in the Lethia Imulsion Facility 
 Their aim is to make it to the makeshift bunker 
 The place where the stranded stay and take this junker 
 The stranded Franklin says that they can take the tank 
 But in exchange Cole and Baird must stay to aid the camp 
 So Dom and Marcus then head off into the darkness 
 They'll probably end up carcasses, but soldier on regardless 
 They watch the light and dodge the night using skill 
 Co-op, cunning and guile style to fight through the Kryll 
 This type of thing takes balls, call it castration 
 Finally they make it through the horde toward the gas station 
 It's not quite right the way they use the spotlight 
 Nah, that kind of ingenuity is fricking godlike 
 Turning the torch on them, burning and scorching them 
 Arriving at the fort in time to support the slaughtering 
 Shoot the guys that aren't human, target neutralised 
 This brutal life will leave your psyche scarred and brutalised 
 Boom, hooah, we are the Gears of War 
 Come on and ask us what the motherfuck we're here for 
 Boom, hooah, we are the Gears of War 
 Come on and ask us what the motherfuck we're here for 
 With the mining facility in literal proximity 
 Their ride begins to give off signs of critical toxicity 
 It's like a syzygy between their fate and electricity 
 They're lucky the place has pedestrian accessibility 
 This utility is a subterranean fortress 
 So they fought hordes till they're deader than this corpser's corpse is 
 If it's the belly of the beast, the neck's an elevator 
 It'll need some rennie when they detonate the resonator 
 The situation's escalating so they'd better get away 
 The locust horde are gonna have to call a decorator 
 Ready to let it blow, they can clear the mess up later 
 But computer says, "No, I couldn't get the data" 
 It's late in the day to call up technical support 
 But they've already put in far too much effort to abort 
 But thankfully Baird appears to be somewhat prepared 
 He found a map and plus just happens to have got it there 
 He's a proper COG, look at his goggles, hair 
 And general masculinity that should be bottled, yeah 
 There'd be romance between us if he never had a penis 
 And anyway, his sights are set on finding Adam Fenix 
 One of the staff of the east barricade academy is 
 As well as being Marcus's dad, an apparent genius 
 So they start for his lab with only half of the manpower they had 
 These COGs have gotta be mad 
 Boom, hooah, we are the Gears of War 
 Come on and ask us what the motherfuck we're here for 
 Boom, hooah, we are the Gears of War 
 Come on and ask us what the motherfuck we're here for 
 Humanity's panicking there's nobody left to save them 
 But wait; the COGs are dropping from the sky inside a raven 
 The finest specimens of 
 Homo sapiens 
 anatomy 
 Collectively heading to the east barricade academy 
 Their aim's to get rid of an alien supremacist 
 Go back to genesis but; hang on, there's a nemacyst 
 It's gone and shot them with spores, the chopper is lost 
 The situation's getting proper debauched 
 It started bad enough but now it's snowballed 
 They have to battle their way back into the mansion like Toad Hall 
 Which is a load more difficult than ABC but luckily they see an APC 
 But it's DOA, see? This is just their luck 
 So Baird and Cole get to business fixing up their truck 
 They need to bolt quick, as if they bust a nut 
 And blustered right into the middle of a clusterfuck 
 While this is happening there's battling inside the mansion 
 Marcus regrets bringing his work home like Bryan Cranston 
 This is a right Branston pickle, who'll provide the answers? 
 While the science is downloading we rely on lancers 
 It's time to pack your bags tighten up your do-rag 
 A futuristic 2Pac in a feudalistic gulag 
 New tactic; taking flight from the pursuit of this big Brumak 
 The damage is higher than the average price is of a new Mac 
 Boom, hooah, we are the Gears of War 
 Come on and ask us what the motherfuck we're here for 
 Boom, hooah, we are the Gears of War 
 Come on and ask us what the motherfuck we're here for 
 Now, act five, an act of desperation 
 There's a cold train coming so they head to the station 
 They never had the patience for a first class pass 
 Besides, that carriage is reserved to carry the light mass 
 Pulses racing, they will need to bypass the whole bloody station 
 To survive upon the right track 
 Marcus and Dom get on with Cole and Baird behind 
 Crap, the final chapter's not designed to happen like that 
 It's time to strike back 
 General Raam is going down shafted like Skywalker's right arm 
 Marcus sees the train is heading straight into a ridge 
 So he sets the light mass off and takes it to the bridge 
 Engine, engine, General Raam 
 How do you like that light mass bomb? 
 When that train goes off the track 
 Skrak-a-rakk-a-rakka scratch one grub 
 Boom, shake, shake, shake the room 
 Boom, shake, shake, shake the room 
 Boom, shake, shake, shake the room 
 Tick, tick, tick, boom 
 Boom, hooah, we are the Gears of War 
 Come on and ask us what the motherfuck we're here for 
 Boom, hooah, we are the Gears of War 
 Come on and ask us what the motherfuck we're here for
