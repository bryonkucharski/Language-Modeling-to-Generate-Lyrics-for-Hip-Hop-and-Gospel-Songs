Look, fuck buddies, I want to be fuck buddies 
 Turn up the subwoofer in the trunk and bump uglies 
 Give me a hug please; I hold a little too long 
 I'm coming on a little too strong 
 You're getting blushed cheeks, so we'd better move on 
 Get a move on, I'm in above my head like a bouffant 
 Take too long and I'm afraid you've gone 
 And I'll have lost another lady, but gained another new song 
 Yes, let's be friends with benefits 
 My love life's suffering a deficit 
 Let's be friends with benefits 
 Friends with benefits 
 I've never been especially eloquent 
 I'm as elegant as an eccied elephant 
 My etiquette is evidently ever in development 
 But when I'm in bed then I'm in my element 
 I promise, honest, we'll listen to some Ella Fitzgerald 
 Then we'll get it on with the leather whips 
 The morning after the night before we caved in 
 Cavemen and cavewomen craving the fornication 
 I'm never sure if it's safe 
 But I'd say that it calls for some glorification 
 Yes, let's be friends with benefits 
 Because I'm ever such a clever dick 
 Let's be friends with benefits 
 Friends with benefits 
 There's so much history to tip-toe around 
 It's hard to keep afloat when the ship's going down 
 Once we danced at the disco in town 
 With both our hips going round 
 I realised through seeing your eyes, it was the genesis 
 Of the end of friends with benefits 
 I'd been increasingly feeling affectionate 
 It seemed that revealing my secret would get a kiss 
 So I leaned in for the hell of it 
 And you ripped the beating thing from my chest and then severed it 
 You're a prejudiced, feminine supremacist 
 Nevertheless you're getting sex from your nemesis 
 Let's not be friends with benefits 
 Because I'm ever such a clever dick 
 Let's not be friends with benefits 
 Because we'll never hear the end of it
