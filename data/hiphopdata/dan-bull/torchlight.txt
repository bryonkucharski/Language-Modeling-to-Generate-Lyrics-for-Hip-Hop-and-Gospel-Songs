I'm in the dungeon under torchlight, hunting for some more fights 
 Lunging at these monsters with a hundred different sword types 
 Sorry chum, this one just isn't your night 
 I'm plundering your undergarments but they feel all tight 
 I collect the sets of armor, check my rare pajamas 
 I slot the buttonhole with ember for some extra mana 
 My hotbar's rock hard, I'm rough like a dog bark 
 You're taking a beating, I've got heart 
 Drop bars like a bard practising a lost art 
 Rap battling a path to the boss part on hard 
 To ensure I've done the job, I employ a wondrous wand 
 You just can't get the staff these days, go on, jog on 
 Waving my piece at dangerous beasts, aim and then squeeze 
 Flaming and making them bleed, draining their veins 
 Changing their brain to debris, savour the pain and release 
 When I slay 'em and the game says, "Your fame has increased" 
 Open up a portal, get back to town 
 Trade resources at the stores and then head back down 
 Lay the smack down on an smorgasbord of organisms 
 If you've got an issue with it, soz, it isn't your decision 
 This is an important mission and in your position 
 I'd put a cork in it, stop talking all this squawk and listen 
 Or I'll leave you in a poor condition, call a mortician 
 There's nothing more that we can do for you, the lore's been written 
 Feed my pet a couple of fishes, delicious 
 Please grant my wishes when I enchant my britches 
 When I'm battling with a Mycon, see a Tu'tara pick a fight 
 See a Ratlin get a fight on while I'm sparring with a Bittersprite 
 Look, I'm not the fickle type, never discriminated 
 If it exists, then it begs to be eliminated, immolated 
 And if I spring a Mimic imitating anything 
 You better believe that I'll obliterate it 
 With a vicious uppercut, call it a facelift 
 If you faith, pray 'cause your fate's writ 
 Gadzooks, look in my hands, loot gathered up to transmute 
 The money that I earn gets burned like a damn Zoot 
 I'm overloading on potions and just hoping 
 I can go in on the next boss without overdosing 
 All this alchemy is probably not healthy, meaning 
 If I use it on my enemies it'll be helping me 
 Light the torches 
 And get down
