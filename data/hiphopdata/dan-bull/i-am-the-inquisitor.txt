Inquisitor 
 Ah, hallo, Sire, shall we travel to the Fallow Mire? 
 These hallowed grounds face a threat that's hella dire 
 And I'm telling buyers beware of where you buy your wares 
 Check their origin like I did when I bought BioWare's 
 In the Arbor Wilds I hear there's a Fade Rift 
 And we need to rescue Farmer Giles somewhere near Redcliffe 
 We're almost at the Storm Coast, Val Royeaux's no more close 
 I sleep in a tent depending on events otherwise I'm in a bed with four posts 
 I suppose I had better be fetching my coat 
 'Cause there's some Red Templars in the Western Approach 
 Oh, the Breach leaves the sky cold up in Skyhold 
 But I can afford to heat it, see this huge pile of my gold 
 No influenza, with these treaties I'm an influencer 
 Think you can beat me? Name a date and place, where and when, sir? 
 Should I spit ten bars or pages? Support Templars or Mages? 
 Collect Shards or guess star constellations and arrangements? 
 Seal rifts shut in Thedas, kick butt and save ass 
 With great gallantry, level up and upgrade my talent tree 
 'Cause it ain't just hard in Hightown, like a tale that Varric weaves 
 There's an ancient massive effect, I may as well just save the galaxy 
 I am the Inquisitor, a Fade visitor 
 Zipping up the rifts with a fist is my signature finisher 
 My team administers me with the means to win imminently 
 And I may say that they do it magnificently 
 Once more unto the Breach, dear friends 
 Once more, because Corypheus wants war 
 Once more unto the Breach, dear friends 
 Once more, we'll see if Corypheus wants more 
 We'll see if Corypheus wants more 
 Or whether he's had enough, he's a bit tired 
 And now he just wants to go home for tea 
 I've got the dopest team in Leliana, Josephine, Cullen, Cassandra 
 Solas, Sera, Blackwall, Dorian, Cole, Vivienne, Varric, Bull, Morrigan 
 Call us the D A Team: the Dannish Inquisition 
 Vacancies, apply within if you think you can fill this grand position 
 Corypheus has delusions of grandeur, a ridiculous man pursuing the Anchor 
 But hang on, you can pray and thank the maker in the Chantry later 
 Wait till Dan obliterates that manky mangy agitator 
 Blast this antagonist as if he's had a Dragon's Kiss 
 Leave him hanging there and haggard like a pair of sagging tits 
 In comparison I'm an ample and elegant breast 
 Not an Iron Bull but I am Bull nevertheless, yes 
 Yes blud, I'm the Tim Westwood of Crestwood 
 The Method Man of the Hinterlands, Haven was the best hood 
 But my terrain ranges from Exalted Plains to Emerald Graves 
 When I stray there's no limit to who and where I will save 
 Between Ferelden and Orlais, I seem to be helping them all day 
 These Orlesians' decor schemes are really well bloody ornate 
 I've heard the myths but this is divine living 
 Like when I'm giving a wyvern a whiff of the rhythm 
 I witness how quick it'll give in 
 Give them a kick in the face from the Forbidden Oasis 
 To the Hissing Wastes to paraphrase Sera: "This is a pissing disgrace" 
 Damn son, I've had it with Samson 
 I'm going to get ever so terribly nasty 
 That's what happens whenever you mess with the Herald of Andraste 
 I am the Inquisitor, a Fade visitor 
 Zipping up the rifts with a fist is my signature finisher 
 My team administers me with the means to win imminently 
 And I may say that they do it magnificently 
 Once more unto the Breach, dear friends 
 Once more, because Corypheus wants war 
 Once more unto the Breach, dear friends 
 Once more, we'll see if Corypheus wants more 
 We'll see if he wants more 
 Once more, once more
