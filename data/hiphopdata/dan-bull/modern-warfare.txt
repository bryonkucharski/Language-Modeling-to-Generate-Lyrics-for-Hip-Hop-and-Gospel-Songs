This is for my cousin Alex 
 Yeah 
 Yo, I'm John "Soap" MacTavish 
 Done loads of damage with my gun 
 Blown up baddies 
 And then totally vanished 
 So keep your eyes peeled 
 And your lips tight sealed 
 Or you might feel 
 The might of my riot shield 
 Forget Battlefield 
 And feck the Batmobile 
 You might as well be playing blackjack 
 Or Track and Field 
 Dragon slaying's aggrivating 
 And it lacks appeal 
 Button bashin' 
 Cuttin', slashin' 
 Nothin' that is real 
 I've got the knack to wield 
 A plethora of weapons 
 Level up again 
 Collect the set 
 And come for seconds 
 I'll kick your RSASS with an MP7 
 Then I'll kick your arse (Ass) 
 Send you to the heavens 
 Yes, I'm quite divine with a Type 95 
 Ha! 
 I bet you couldn't even type "95" 
 I'm not pulling your leg 
 I'm putting you to bed 
 With a bullet in your head 
 So goodbye, nighty night 
 Ayo, I'm dropping tons of songs 
 In Cluster bombs 
 A Tuff Gong 
 So If I'm not your #1 
 Then there's something wrong 
 Suck your mom 
 I've done a ton of run and gun 
 You've done a runner, son 
 I run amok amongst these other 
 Motherfuckin' chumps 
 I'm a son of a gun 
 You're the son of your mum 
 There's not another that's as good 
 Under the sun 
 I'm 
 More than the sum of my parts 
 Pull you apart for fun 
 I'll serve a server full of nerds 
 As I'm the hardest one 
 Between you and me 
 I'm a UMP 
 You're a pea shooter 
 Doing stupid to a T 
 I'm sure Yuri can do a free beautifully 
 And Captain Price's tracks are nice 
 But they lack the 
 Fanatical 
 Tactical 
 Flashy 
 Grammatical 
 Radical 
 Classical 
 Stats 
 To satisfy my appetite 
 If any prat'll mess with me 
 Then he dies 
 So blast this MP3 
 Like an MP5 
 You don't need a statistician 
 To see I smack the rhythm 
 With a degree of accuracy 
 That's needed for atom splittin' 
 That's precision 
 When I'm rappin' about matter, fission 
 Having a laugh with physics 
 And still bringing cracking lyrics 
 To challenge MacTavish to a battle 
 Is a bad decision 
 Masochism 
 I'll kick your ass on any map you pick 
 And have you wishing that you didn't 
 Little lad, you lack the jism 
 To come back and tackle Britain 
 And in fact this is an actual acquisition 
 Of Activision's rap division 
 And Daniel's mission 
 Is to kick the ass of competition 
 I'm a handy mix of Andy McNab and Biggie 
 And when I smoke a fag 
 I don't mean that I have a ciggie 
 Sorry for the homophobic slang 
 But that's what happens 
 Idiots'll thrown a frag 
 And blow up faster 
 Than my rapping videos 
 Although I love kittens 
 I'm a great softie 
 But don't tell anybody 
 Stay frosty
