And I don't know what it is but I think I like you 
 And I think I'd like it if you liked me too 
 And I don't know what it is but I think I like you 
 And I think I'd like it if you liked me too 
 And I don't know what it is but I think I like you 
 And I think I'd like it if you liked me too 
 Things are different since that you're there 
 This must be that thing they call love 
 My vision shift from grey to colour 
 This must be that thing they call love 
 Things are different since that you're there 
 My vision shift from grey to colour 
 This must be that thing they call love 
 This must be that thing they call love 
 It's been four or five years since we talked now but I 
 Never thought so high of any girl in all of my life 
 I thought you were gorgeous, warm and bright 
 You taught me all sorts and brought me to life 
 L'amour and more besides 
 When you spoke to my folks you were always polite 
 Though you always tried to hide that you were awfully shy 
 And how you'd always call me gorgeous was nice 
 I saw in your eyes I was more than just like 
 Some sort of ordinary guy of the ordinary type 
 It all just seemed right when you joined me at night 
 Then lay nattering, chatting and talking till light 
 I was that infatuated I could fall for you twice 
 We'd take lonely walks in August with Spice 
 Make phone calls and talk till morning sunrise 
 You were so great I thought you must have fallen from the sky 
 I couldn't wait for the day I could call you my wife 
 And gaze at your face through morning and night 
 Safely sailing away with my glorious bride 
 It's a shame that my mates didn't warn me in time 
 You were faithless and fake, it was all just a lie 
 You gave no warning, or a goodbye 
 You just stalled me, ignoring my calls and the like 
 So inform me - were you always unkind 
 Or did you morph to this poor form, absorbed in your spite 
 That liked to torture me with scornful calls, taunt me with guys 
 Flaunt them right by me and causing these fights 
 You were warping my mind with all of your lies 
 But I bet your side of the story's forty leagues from mine 
 Sure, you just sort of got bored of me, right? 
 Once the source of your light, now a thorn in your side 
 I'm a cautious guy so it tore me inside 
 It floored me forlornly 'cause I thought we were tight 
 I missed most of sixth form, withdrawn from my life 
 Spent all my nights smoking draw, drinking wine 
 When I saw you I'd go maudlin and cry 
 When I thought of you lying with some poor other guy 
 I had violent thoughts of all different types 
 And all through the times you would call me up crying 
 You didn't even inform me you were poorly or why 
 So of course I had a reason or a cause to be frightened 
 I thought I'd be caught in causing your suicide 
 So I pray for your sake that you sorted your life 
 But Christ, falling for you was an unfortunate choice 
 And yeah, I've been a wanker, I've been an arsehole 
 But leave it at that and the track's only half told 
 When I'm an old cold man with a hardened soul 
 I'll look back on the past as that when I had a heart of gold 
 But in my heart there's a hole 
 That you made, and it's taken ages to get the heartache controlled 
 It'd taken a hold, Taken its toll 
 Making me wholly incapable of attaining my goals 
 The strain of the whole weight on my shoulders 
 Is aching, my composure is breaking, I'm going insane, oh god 
 You were mine 
 And mine forever 
 A minor error 
 You were mine
