(Dead if you try, you dead if you try) 
 (Motherfuckers dead in the streets) 
 I woke up from unconsciousness, my fellow officers 
 All slaughtered, my God what the fuck is this? 
 Not gonna lie, I'm quite scared, colleagues are lying right there 
 I'm either off my tits or I'm having a nightmare 
 I enter the site of the mental asylum 
 Armed with the intention to find whatever the heck is messing my mind up 
 This best be a wind up, a prank in poor taste 
 If this is you, Sam Pepper, you've landed a court case 
 How does a corpse taste? What does it feel like to kill? 
 To go insane in the brain like you're Cypress Hill? 
 I can't find my pills, I'm going through withdrawal 
 Ruined thoughts of doing all sorts of stuff that's truly awful 
 Mortal wounds and torture scenes, debauchery 
 The sort of thing that no lawful being ought to see 
 Proceed with caution, what you see's a distortion 
 The proportions of reality have been reapportioned 
 Backstreet abortions, meat, bleeding orphans weep 
 It's even more nauseous than a rerun of Dawson's Creek 
 Look that the people you're with, beneath all the grins 
 Take a deeper peak and see the evil within 
 Now flash back to sunflowers and a country house 
 It looks as if somebody must have let Ted Bundy out 
 Sebastian Castellanos, crouched and casting shadows 
 Between the splash damaged couch and the smashed piano 
 Just give me the chance to vamos and I'll be out of this place 
 'Cause now my trousers are stained, I doubt it helps with the case 
 I don't remember seeing this in Goat Simulator 
 Look, I think I better get my coat and go, see you later 
 Look that the people you're with, beneath all the grins 
 Take a deeper peak and see the evil within 
 Look that the people you're with, beneath all the grins 
 Take a deeper peak and see the evil within 
 Look that the people you're with, beneath all the grins 
 Take a deeper peak and see the evil within 
 Look that the people you're with, beneath all the grins 
 Take a deeper peak and see the evil within
