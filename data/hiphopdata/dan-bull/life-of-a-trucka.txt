You alright, fella? 
 Yeah, mate, I ent seen you in ages, chap 
 How's it going mate? What up, mucka? 
 Me, I'm doing bloody great, I'm a trucker 
 Ha, pull out the gaffer's yard in a large cab 
 Ah, that feeling rubber rubbing on the Tarmac 
 My, my, I see the skyline fly by 
 Due to my tyre size, I'm sure I'm a mile high 
 Energy sending me serenity, firefly 
 A soiled dirty magazine is my private life 
 So if you see my lorry rocking in a lay-by 
 It may be quite wise not to knock and say hi 
 The way I pull up, it's hard to miss it 
 But if I leave it here I'll have a parking ticket 
 And if I catch a traffic cop who starts to stick it 
 I'll tell him where exactly up his arse I'll kick it 
 When I park like this, then I ooze style, look 
 Never mind if it's risking a huge pile-up 
 I park it like it's hot, a used fire truck 
 You're behind the times, bruv: "Ooh, dial-up" 
 Man, trucking is the life and I live it 
 Now I want to pimp my ride, call up Xzibit 
 Tell him attach some lights and a different trim 
 Go-faster stripes and some wicked rims 
 Hypnotised by the strobe of the cat's eyes 
 And when the rain flows, I am baptised 
 How's it going mate? What up, mucka? 
 Me, I'm doing bloody great, I'm a trucker 
 How's it going mate? What up, mucka? 
 Me, I'm doing bloody great, I'm a trucker 
 Forget that big rig over the road 
 Racing past him like nobody knows 
 I'm not overly loaded down with a load of wheels 
 So many going 'round, it's unreal 
 I feel appeal in the cab of my truck 
 So I seal the deal and peel off like a scab, yuk 
 Call it meals on wheels 'cause I'm delivering 
 Four tonnes of peas on four tonnes of steel 
 From city scenery to greenery 
 This is the epitome of machinery 
 It's just me and the road, woop woop! 
 Man, I feel like Toad, poop poop! 
 My windscreen is an ever-shifting picture 
 From Carlisle to Calais, Koln, Katowice 
 I stop off at Rostock before turning 
 And burning rubber all the way back home to Birmingham 
 How's it going mate? What up, mucka? 
 Me, I'm doing bloody great, I'm a trucker 
 How's it going mate? What up, mucka? 
 Me, I'm doing bloody great, I'm a trucker 
 How's it going mate? What up, mucka? 
 Me, I'm doing bloody great, I'm a trucker 
 How's it going mate? What up, mucka? 
 Me, I'm doing bloody great, I'm a trucker 
 Life of a trucka 
 Wouldn't change it for anything, man 
 Shove your office job up your arse, mate 
 It's just me and the road now 
 Me and the road
