Only rapper to be called a thief without stealing 
 Download an MP3 for free, these people hit the ceiling 
 I'm just a citizen that's teaching you a lesson 
 For restricting my freedom of expression 
 How can ideas be possessions when they're freely replicable? 
 Hence unapplicable property laws are reprehensible 
 Didn't Jefferson express his opinion on the matter 
 When he said inventions shouldn't be given a patent 
 What happened to that thinking, we're stuck in a pattern 
 Where the people with everything are keeping everything from us who haven't 
 We want it back, look, fed up of adverts, left and right 
 Begging me to buy till there's nothing left of mine 
 To spend, never mind, who's next in line to testify 
 That we need laws like these to protect our rights? 
 Medicine has never been something I'd ever deprive 
 Especially when a life depends on it to survive 
 Yeah, it takes an incredible effort to develop them right 
 But putting wealth over health, I said it's never been right 
 I'm just a citizen that's teaching you a lesson 
 For restricting my freedom of expression, and I reckon 
 If old blues themes hadn't been used by Led Zeppelin 
 We wouldn't ever have any heavy metal then 
 The history of music would have never even happened 
 And amusingly there wouldn't even be a Metallica 
 To tell us that we should hang on the gallows of law 
 So we wouldn't even need to have a Gallo Report 
 Oh and by the way the fricking Gallo's support 
 Is made of signatures which have been apparently forged 
 This shit is sinister, and cannot be allowed to enforce 
 So tell your ministers and MEPs of how it's been brought about 
 Although you'll probably get a shallow retort 
 Because the lobbyists have got a grip around all their balls 
 If I was boss, I'd tell them get the Hell out the door 
 Because I've had enough of corrupt crooks ramming through laws 
 I'm just a citizen that's teaching you a lesson 
 For restricting my freedom of expression 
 Yes, and deep packet inspection? squeeze that up your rectum 
 If your postman did that to you you'd be having him sectioned 
 Arrested for meddling in your private affairs 
 But it's only online, right? so why should we care? 
 Because digital rights should be applicable right 
 Here in real life, and we're not criminals, right? 
 So this is just why we'll never give up the fight 
 To be considered innocent until we kick up and die 
 Giving internet providers responsibility 
 For the whims of their subscribers infringes privacy 
 Before the internet, media was a rarity 
 But how do you expect it to keep its value without scarcity 
 And that's what scares me, seeing their cons and schemes 
 To stop their creaking business model being obsolete 
 What a robbery they pull off so obviously 
 Don't give a fuck who it affects as long as it's not me 
 Well I'll keep making copies, see if they can stop me 
 They'll have to confiscate my PC and take it off me 
 See there's no problem with taking my property 
 For creating some lines of binary, blatant hypocrisy 
 Afraid to face the controversy relating to what we need 
 Making a profit off it or breaking monopolies
