Excuse me, outlander 
 A word in your ear, if I may 
 Well met, stranger 
 Elated to make your acquaintance 
 Now, may I entertain you with some quotations over cadence? 
 You see, I bear some rare, amazing information 
 And you look like someone who is used to strange situations 
 There is a hidden portal within the Bard's College 
 I was brought through, an immortal to impart knowledge 
 About an otherworldly form of Redguard sonnet 
 They took a thumping drum beat and said bars on it 
 I wandered through Solitude, departed Haafingar 
 Past Hjaalmarch, through The Reach, east of Markarth 
 I reached the Whiterun Hold 
 I preached in rhyme and told the people 
 That the need to speak was higher than the price of gold 
 Nothing can beat soul, not even sweet rolls 
 I've got it locked like a pick stuck in a keyhole 
 I leave you wee trolls wishing that you'd re-rolled 
 By the Nine Divines, my rhyme's a sight to behold 
 My freeholds are threefold 
 I rock the property chain 
 'Cause I'm the top bloody Thane in this Monopoly game 
 So you'd better watch the throne, Stormcloak 
 'Cause you're getting overthrown by an ordinary bloke 
 It's high time Skyrim had a new High King 
 And I like hiking, it's quite exciting 
 I'm descended from the Vikings back in my kingdom 
 But my lyric writing's better than my skill at fighting 
 My pen is mightier than swords; it's the right choice 
 They call me "MF Thu'um" when I use my Voice 
 With each rap, my Speechcraft keeps stacking 
 If you could see the graph, you'd actually be laughing 
 You'll never sound as fresh, I'm a rockstar 
 I climb the seven thousand steps to High Hrothgar 
 Like Jurgen Windcaller, my words'll bring more disorder 
 Than mixing Skooma in an Orcish brigand's drink order 
 A bawdy bard that raps, my Voice'll cause your cart to crash 
 Your horse's armor cracks under the awesome force of Paarthurnax 
 But here's the secret I needed to tell 
 You can be an MC with me as well 
 Forget the Blades, me and you don't need the Greybeards 
 Who are Mehrunes Dagon and the Daedra to an atheist? 
 Mages, take your Spell Tome and go the hell home 
 'Cause who needs boots of speed when we've got shell toes? 
 And, so whether you drink Honeymead or Alto 
 Be sure that Dan'll smelt flows till all of Tamriel knows 
 You should use the bars of the bard deep inside you 
 And tilll we meet again, friend 
 Talos guide you 
 Talos guide you
