Stay prepared for the up and downs, life is like a see-saw 
 Some say it's a bitch, man I couldn't agree more 
 One minute you're on top, then you're in the ER 
 One minute she wants you, then she wants to leave all 
 All I can do is take the good with the bad and keep on 
 Gotta work hard, gotta give the fans the mean songs 
 Give these programmers more shit that they can sleep on 
 Give these biting cunts more shit that they can feast on 
 Money come and go out your life like the seasons 
 People do too sometimes without a reason 
 And it kind of seamed wrong when they took his life 
 Should of killed this dude, he's a fucking dick right 
 And maybe get some insight from Jesus, ala, jehova 
 Some will prey on Sunday some will spend it hung over 
 Whether drunk or sober, hearts is getting colder, globe is getting warmer 
 Maybe that's some karma for real 
 Woke up feeling down, now I'm feeling great 
 Things can really flip around on you in a day 
 But till tomorrow, till tomorrow 
 Oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
 Pay day I'm rich, next day poor 
 Sittin' on my bed wondering why I bother for 
 But till tomorrow, till tomorrow 
 Oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
 Most people all talk, no action 
 Over that shit and numerate it to a fraction 
 Maybe on the internet having little word wars, 
 Typing in their 2 cents acting like it's worth more 
 Tell you how to surf, when they've never touched a surfboard 
 Dissing Tiger Woods when they're fucking even worse whores 
 You get the urge wanna go and call them out 
 Making you just as bad as them by all accounts 
 And what it all amounts to ain't shit, 
 Working at a slave ship hit by the same whip as the person that you're arguing with 
 A lot of people that you're arguing about all remain ripped 
 Say laters to this try focus on your own life then you see Haitians with no homes no lights 
 Make you grateful for what you have but got to make you wonder if you really are giving what you can 
 (It's a trip) 
 Woke up feeling down, now I'm feeling great 
 Things can really flip around on you in a day 
 But till tomorrow, till tomorrow 
 Oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
 Pay day I'm rich, next day poor 
 Sittin' on my bed wondering why I bother for 
 But till tomorrow, till tomorrow 
 Oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
 We all wake up and go oh I ain't I'm not 18 anymore 
 You know I'm in my thirties, but so what at least I got my health 
 If you haven't got your health, if you've got one leg 
 At least I haven't got 2 legs missing, and if you have lost both legs and both arms 
 Just go at least I'm not dead, I'd rather be dead 
 Woke up feeling down, now I'm feeling great 
 Things can really flip around on you in a day 
 But till tomorrow, till tomorrow 
 Oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
 Pay day I'm rich, next day poor. 
 Sittin' on my bed wondering why I bother for 
 But till tomorrow, till tomorrow 
 Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
