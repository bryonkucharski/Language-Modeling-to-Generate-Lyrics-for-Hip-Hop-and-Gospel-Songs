Been with me through the worst and the best 
 Swear on this beat in my chest 
 I'mma be there in a sec if you call 
 Give you my all 
 I stand tall, cause you make me believe 
 Even when it's dark, I can light it up 
 Nothin' we can't achieve 
 And I've been breathing these sighs of relief 
 When I was feelin' my chance was blown 
 My team lets me know I'm not alone 
 I feel stronger than Kanye, because of you 
 And I'd take a million more L's to get the W 
 And when I get it, betta believe that I'mma smother you 
 Covet you, what's mine is yours - know how your brother do 
 Just to show you I owe you and nah this ain't no other dude 
 Never change, never strange, round you I'm so comfortable for real 
 So when you see me put ya hands together 
 If you really down with me I'll be your man forever 
 When you feel a little weak I'm right here remember 
 Let these people talk, they can be mad forever, ever 
 I never, knew I could feel this way 
 We don't reveal or say, but even the coolest exteriors can get peeled away 
 Under certain situations, feelin' ya limitations 
 Man it seem like god couldn't overcome the shit I'm facin 
 I'm cavin, never sayin' that it's your help I need 
 But you came and, saved a brother who thinkin' selfishly 
 I failed to see, all sad feelings temporary 
 And like fine wine... the shit gets better with time 
 So shine baby shine, do this for you as much as me 
 Rewind baby wind, what we've been through will make us kings 
 And this game got valleys and peaks 
 Walls, barriers, seas 
 I ain't scared to fall 'cause I know that you carryin me 
 So when you see me put ya hands together 
 If you really down with me I'll be your man forever 
 When you feel a little weak I'm right here remember 
 Let these people talk, they can be mad forever, ever
