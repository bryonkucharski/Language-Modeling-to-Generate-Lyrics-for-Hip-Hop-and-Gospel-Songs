Don't give me up 
 You ain't gonna take me down 
 I don't like to remember when you were around 
 But you walk my way like you got something to say 
 This ain't got shit to do with you 
 Been a while since you had it like this I bet 
 Said I'd never do better but this chick I met 
 Is a bit of all right yeah she's pretty all right 
 And she ain't in the club trying to kick it all night 
 Doesn't get to drunk, talk shit, cause fights 
 Finally enough, other chicks seem to all like here 
 Unlike you and me were together you were on some tupac shit you against the world 
 I was on some Marvin gay shit what's going on 
 Sometimes Rodney king can't we all just get along 
 You were never ever wrong I was never ever right 
 We would just forever fight, girl I had to get a life 
 And I'm happy now, yet you coming back around like its happy hour 
 Tryin' take more shots tryin' tap me out 
 I gotta let you know it ain't gonna happen now 
 Don't give me up 
 You ain't gonna take me down 
 I don't like to remember when you were around 
 But you walk my way like you got something to say 
 This ain't got shit to do with you 
 I don't know what the issue is 
 Why you seem to really care who I kick it with 
 When we broke up you didn't give a shit 
 Don't cry dry your eyes here's a tissue Mrs. 
 Heard you backstabbed my girl and I'm sick of it 
 I don't wanna hear you pleading your innocence 
 I don't even wanna see you a little bit 
 And that's all it is you hate that you isn't Mrs. 
 It's your ego, got your world going balls up like a free-throw 
 Probably got you playing fuck you by cee low 
 Think about me like its really my fault 
 I'm thinking about you like your really bipolar 
 Really quite over your juvenile ways 
 Better back that ass up like juvenile says 
 Before you thinking coming round here 
 Go and get your own shit together 
 Do I make myself clear 
 Don't give me up 
 You ain't gonna take me down 
 I don't like to remember when you were around 
 But you walk my way like you got something to say 
 This ain't got shit to do with you
