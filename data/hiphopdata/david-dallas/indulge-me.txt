Ooh, what a night this eve 
 With the homies Jordache and Aaron on the beat 
 It's the C-O-N I, ain't come to play around 
 Steady tryna think, of a place we can take it now 
 Take it real slow, tryna be respectful too 
 So I just suggest it to you like 
 Do you wanna come sit over here and chill 
 See I got a friend that'll serve us drinks until 
 He gets off, I kinda think that you'd be best off 
 Riding this thing out, there'll be less cost 
 For you, and for me I get the bonus the best view 
 But I put the onus against you, no stress tho 
 You can make your mind up, what you wanna do 
 I'm doin' me with this heineken, till the night is done 
 But there's no denyin I like your company 
 Can I get ya name and ya number say 
 Can I get a smile on ya face I'd pay 
 For a drink or two just get to know me 
 Don't leave, no no no you gotta indulge me 
 Take a sip, go ahead 
 Nah I won't take advantage if it go to your head 
 I'm opposed to that red wine 
 Just a little bit of that for me is bedtime 
 Won't get ahead of myself 
 I'm tellin' you I'm in for the long haul 
 Till the fat lady, singin' the encore 
 On tour ? oh you really wanna know 
 See I don't think you do, you just really wanna show 
 That you ain't no, no no young h-o 
 Tryna hook up anything that's in the place tho 
 No you ain't gotta worry bout that 
 'Cause if I thought it, I wouldn't really sit around and chat 
 So just sit around and lap 
 The attention up, and don't worry ain't nobody gotta mention us 
 That ascension buzz 'cause we on the up and up 
 So when you see me lookin' maybe you could pucker up 
 Can I get ya name and ya number say 
 Can I get a smile on ya face I'd pay 
 For a drink or two just get to know me 
 Don't leave, no no no you gotta indulge me 
 It seems you've been playing around 
 Tryna figure out, how I get down 
 But you know, know 
 It's sweet if you stay right here 
 You got no idea 
 But I'll show you though, I hope you know 
 Can I get ya name and ya number say 
 Can I get a smile on ya face I'd pay 
 For a drink or two just get to know me 
 Don't leave, no no no you gotta indulge me
