Yeah, yeah, I'm high upon a new wave of confidence 
 I'm trying to ride it to a few different continents 
 Known in the country I am from but anonymous 
 To most of the populous in dominant 
 Market places, I'm from New Zealand and I use to seeing different faces 
 And they don't ever turn the radio to different stations 
 I gotta do it though cause mom is getting sick of waiting 
 When I was young she used to tell me "Have some fucking patience" 
 But she loved the baby boy raised the guy like I'm on roids playing with the toys 
 I'm grateful for the voice I've been given 
 Big boy now my purple whip about to have all the shutter bugs flicking 
 Straight sippin' vodka soda with the twist in 
 Jamaraqio playin' I don't say it should be different it's still hip hop in the vein 
 Smirnoff in the brain, always been a cool dude I'll let you know if it change 
 I'm kicking back feeling good on a Friday 
 Ain't letting all the bullshit get in my way 
 Know that I stay caught in a daze 
 Caught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze 
 I'm in a good mood don't mess in my high, things are looking up 
 You can see in my eyes, so you know I'm 
 Caught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze 
 Bitch I'm caught in a daze, holdup with these police again 
 ... And these vehicles we ...that's why they hate 
 Custom colors is my ... in up on 60's 
 If you ever trying to find my I'd probably be ...with me 
 ...Open up baggy stuff like muffins 
 Out of dope enjoy your crisis ain't in my buddy so fuck it 
 I stuck 'em up and got on the highway, freddy gibbs get fried like everyday is Friday 
 In the place I reside I keep that iron cause them goons gonna be lurking 
 Keep my dope spot popping in my ... 
 Put me on a licking anybody move I'ma murk them knock them off their shoes and get their ass to ... 
 That's for certain, bitch you perpin' and flirting with death if you fuck with mine 
 Freddie ain't shit, he'll walk up and take your life in this life of crime 
 In this life of mine I took recent put my life on a line 
 Agents ask me for a statement I decline 
 I'm kicking back feeling good on a Friday 
 Ain't letting all the bullshit get in my way 
 Know that I stay caught in a daze 
 Caught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze 
 I'm in a good mood don't mess with my high, things are looking up 
 You can see in my eyes, so you know I'm 
 Caught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze 
 It's all they can never chop me down, deeply rooted in the ground 
 Way I spit it's so profound, know the sound like some shit you heard before 
 But it ain't everyone's an artist now but I'm using different paint man 
 I'm using different egg for the story, this is guts this is glory 
 It's the rush of performing it's the slut when you're horny 
 It's the feeling that you get when you wake up in the morning 
 All that feeling that you get when the sun's dawning on another day 
 And you ain't seen your life another way 
 Working at the same job for next to nothing pay 
 Plugging away it's the dreams trying to hold this shit together 
 While the worlds tugging away, at the seams, see 
 Struggling it ain't no fame, one you looking back 
 But fuck if you ever again try to go through that 
 So I see it like a vintage car 
 You put your all in, and ride it out once then its in the garage. 
 You talk about it with your friends as a symbol of the hard work 
 This is all a means to an end, lookin' at it through a lens that's rose tinted, 
 It's probably why you hear it in my voice I'm so committed 
 I'm kicking back feeling good on a Friday 
 Ain't letting all the bullshit get in my way 
 Know that I stay caught in a daze 
 Caught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze 
 I'm in a good mood don't mess with my high, things are looking up 
 You can see in my eyes, so you know I'm 
 Caught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze.
