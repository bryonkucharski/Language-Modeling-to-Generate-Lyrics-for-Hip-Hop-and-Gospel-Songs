I just want everything to be perfect 
 Everything to fit into place 
 House, food on the table and some liquor to chase 
 But my moms still hooked on how cigarettes taste 
 And my dad lost his eye and a bit of his face 
 About a month back cause of cancer 
 Trying to figure how to really deal, no evander 
 This sort of shit can make you jump off the --- 
 When peeps that don't know you seem to think that you're a wanker 
 But I don't harbor no anger to em, my big brothers oversees wonder how he's doing 
 Wish that he could be home with us, he a loner at heart so worry if he's on his own too much 
 And I owe so much to the fam, that I'm feeling like a failure 
 When I can't even lend a hand on the money front 
 I'm hoping things is on the up and up 
 When my career fingers crossed I don't fuck it up 
 But all it takes is one man and one word 
 And the greatest song make it go unheard 
 Lord knows there was better men before that went under the radar 
 I kid you no stories, so I isn't mad at stations who don't play my recordings 
 I'm just fucking happy that 'm performing 
 And that you listening to me, right now, you'll see 
 So you should put your hands up, hey 
 It ain't perfect but we be doing okay 
 I'm living proof you could do what you never thought 
 And best believe it's the truth that you hear me talk 
 Bro you should put your hands up, hey 
 It isn't perfect but we be doing okay 
 I'm living proof you could do what you never thought 
 And best believe it's the truth that you hear me talk 
 Where we headed now there isn't no guessing 
 But I'm tired of hearing the same old questions 
 When ya gonna find a real profession 
 I don't need a reminder bro's stop stressing 
 I rather keep messing with this music shit and hardly make a cent 
 Before I go to David Brent just to pay the rent 
 Because an office cubicle is not suitable when you're the star 
 Like they trying to make you play the bench 
 I ain't content with that, I won't stop to surrender like ----- 
 Ya see the flip side is I need a new Mac pro 
 A lack though---- 
 Could probably ask my girlfriend if she would lend for that 
 But too proud for a hand or a hand out 
 I'm tired of staying this still, I'm trying to stand out 
 Be the man now, that's the plan now 
 From here on guess we'll see out it fans out 
 So you should put your hands up, hey 
 It ain't perfect but we be doing okay 
 I'm living proof you could do what you never thought 
 And best believe it's the truth that you hear me talk 
 Bro you should put your hands up, hey 
 It ain't perfect but we be doing okay 
 I'm living proof you could do what you never thought 
 And best believe it's the truth that you hear me talk 
 I know I walk like I grew up in a war zone 
 I tread lightly, even when a store wont 
 Blow my horn though, 
 I don't like to draw no attention to myself 
 How ironic my careers based on getting on the shelf 
 Or a blog or a stage, put my whole life on the page 
 And I hope that some relate to what I say 
 It Sounds so vain when I put it in those terms 
 When asked about the industry I ain't go no words 
 But people press try to ask me how them hoes were 
 Wonder why I wasn't at the club when my bros were 
 On the red carpet showing up with a chauffeur 
 And VIP with big bottles of patron were 
 And truth I was at home, chillin' on the 360 
 Knowing if I died them fake dudes wouldn't miss me 
 Everybody's best friends when they getting tipsy 
 But when the free drinks run they seem to jet quickly 
 So you should put your hands up, hey 
 It ain't perfect but we be doing okay 
 I'm living proof you could do what you never thought 
 And best believe it's the truth that you hear me talk 
 Bro you should put your hands up, hey 
 It ain't perfect but we be doing okay 
 I'm living proof you could do what you never thought 
 And best believe it's the truth that you hear me talk
