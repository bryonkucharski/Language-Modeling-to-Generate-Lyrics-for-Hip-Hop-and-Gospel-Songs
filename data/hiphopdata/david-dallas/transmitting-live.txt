Get up on my frequency 
 You can catch me broadcasting legally 
 This raw South Pacific scenery 
 What you see in me is nothing like that Peter Jack Flint 
 I never been the type to treat the truth like it's Mr. Fantastic 
 It's really so damn sick, I'll stick to the damn script 
 You think you're the man, I'm here to fuck up your plans quick 
 A little pedantic with the details kinda hand grip 
 Of this so-called ex persons speak my language 
 Don't write about this, listen up 
 You need to put your pants down 'cause you miss too much 
 ...And the quest for getting bread ain't no telling where we'll be lead 
 Till I'm dead... another young Polynesian try to go with Instagram 
 I never donated the posies that didn't know my name 
 I done say Grace at the table, I'm thinking I changed 
 Been the same since primary school 
 Rolling on them BMXs, you were riding, fool 
 Thinking that it might be cool to play some Dr. Dre today 
 I was ...tryina learn this shit 
 Now I'm transmitting live 
 Feel the vibe, you can even ride 
 Or collide, you won't be denied 
 Tell a friend, could tell a friend 
 We're going in, transmitting live 
 Now I'm transmitting live 
 Feel the vibe, you can even ride 
 Or collide, you won't be denied 
 Tell a friend, could tell your friends 
 We're going in, transmitting live 
 On the TV up in high fidelity, don't give a fuck what they telling me 
 Catch a felony for real, they try to mute my voice 
 But can't monopolize the airwaves, now there's a choice 
 To let me hoist some of these issues on my shoulders 
 Nice getting colder, different role, different soldier 
 None of us can get a mortgage 
 Only thing that they reporting is some E Channel flings 
 All the music they recording sounds like people can't sing 
 And an athlete can't swig without a PD allegation 
 My boy just got the not, on board with three applications 
 New degree, congratulations, getting accusations 
 When they try to cut him off, say he ain't on a hunt for jobs 
 It's like fuck it, dog, didn't sign up for this 
 Had to grab this mic and try some other shit 
 Me and my production clique took that off the bucket list 
 Years later, look at what we coming with 
 Now I'm transmitting live 
 Feel the vibe, you can even ride 
 Or collide, you won't be denied 
 Tell a friend, could tell a friend 
 We're going in, transmitting live 
 Now I'm transmitting live 
 Feel the vibe, you can even ride 
 Or collide, you won't be denied 
 Tell a friend, could tell your friends 
 We're going in, transmitting live
