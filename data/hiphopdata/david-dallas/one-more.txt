You ain't gotta say no more 
 We ain't tryna break no more 
 We're just tryna hear one more 
 Bring her back, baby goes 
 You ain't gotta say no more 
 We ain't tryna break no more 
 We're just tryna hear one more 
 Bring her back, baby goes 
 Sometimes'll be a long night after a long day 
 You should take a picture and stop boring out that... 
 Mix it with that tonic water, then there's just relax 
 Getting in my one's addictive, I'm bout to relax 
 This is NZ drinking cold and running though these veins 
 Education running through my brain used to fuck 
 That damn native DMC chains 
 Nowadays I come from rock with a lot of these lames 
 That they plan when I'm stepping out, you's tryna step me out 
 Play some cool shit I know the words 
 And they look out the fool 
 Really ain't my fault that you're a square you step it up 
 After 3 AM just don't bother tryna get in touch 
 Feeling like I'm super groove cause now I can't get enough 
 Dudes probably need a fully cover they can't get no luck 
 With the girls in here, but before I leave 
 If I can't tell the DJ to play another jam 
 You ain't gotta say no more 
 We ain't tryna break no more 
 We're just tryna hear one more 
 Bring her back, baby goes 
 You ain't gotta say no more 
 We ain't tryna break no more 
 We're just tryna hear one more 
 Bring her back, baby goes 
 There they go, there they go 
 Call me long hole Dita 
 There's sun on the horizon and there's gonna be seeing me all 
 I've been off of this bourbon so for certain I'll be down 
 For whatever wanna trust I'm feeling a little more underground 
 Swear that we don't fuck around, treat this nightclub like my lawn 
 Boot this DJ, plug the iPhone and play my own sound 
 And on that note pulsing on my chest 
 Stepped up in this bitch with my hat low 
 Dudes are ...next getting up tight 
 Cuffing up the women tryna whisper to them some light 
 Girl I'm just one guard, don't get yourself tongue tied 
 Really explain it made it on the blood line 
 Out here tryna on one 'cause I'm worth for it just like you did 
 Bet yo girl just recognize me like I was the Nike tip 
 You see that exit bro, squish just do it 
 One more tune before we... 
 You ain't gotta say no more 
 We ain't tryna break no more 
 We're just tryna hear one more 
 Bring her back, baby goes 
 You ain't gotta say no more 
 We ain't tryna break no more 
 We're just tryna hear one more 
 Bring her back, baby goes
