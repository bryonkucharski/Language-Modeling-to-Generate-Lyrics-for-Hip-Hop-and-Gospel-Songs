Make room, there ain't no fakin my mood 
 Feel I'm the greatest, no bull. s 
 Ain't breakin into a sweat, nah this ain't no duet

 P.I, Mama side, plus the white dad you'll find me 
 That's the make-up I'll be reppin till I'm dead 
 Plus I spit that ill shit that be fuckin' with yo head 
 And I'm also way ahead of the pack 
 Got the vans on, peter pannin out in Japan and gotta get them cans of 
 Chu-Hi-i-i chillin' with S.Hansen, now Mmboppin we get it poppin' 
 Stop them where their hands are... up in the air, they, up in the air 
 Everything just ain't what it appears, but this is 
 I'm really the shit kid, so fricken addictive 
 Sick, truth hurts, no quik in this it's just Nicholas and me 
 The best 1-2 since, Tyson hit up Michael Spinx 
 Go go sit up on your fence, I'mma piss upon it hence 
 Whoa shit, run it down, foes take cover now 
 If you on the come up pal, this is how it's goin' down 
 Rush, rush we movin on up up you on my lane 
 Get out the way, la da da da da day hey 
 Plus, plus nobody but us us does it the same 
 Get out the way, la da da da da day hey 
 Don't tell me to fall back, I'll creep through the back door 
 I'll climb through the window, it's locked, I'm breakin the latch cause 
 We live for the day 
 Get out the way, la da da da da day hey

 Yeah yeah my peoples, this heres the sequel 
 I'm T2 with the rhymin, James Cameron my vibe and 
 These days I reside in the M.A call it the mount 
 Still carry that drive all up in me, call it the south 
 Aucks mindstate I recall, them old spacies at Bob's 
 I come straight off the Corner of Hunters, I was born 
 To chase game and win, place it in my aim 
 A sore loser I play to win, David is the name, plain 
 Whoa shit, run it down, foes take cover now 
 If you on the come up pal, this is how it's goin' down 
 Rush, rush we movin on up up you on my lane 
 Get out the way, la da da da da day hey 
 Plus, plus nobody but us us does it the same 
 Get out the way, la da da da da day hey 
 Don't tell me to fall back, I'll creep through the back door 
 I'll climb through the window, it's locked, I'm breakin the latch cause 
 We live for the day 
 Get out the way, la da da da da day hey
