I am, I am, I am, I am 
 Swinging for the stands, let me see your hands 
 Try to mash out on this life, fame and do the dance 
 What's the plan, man, I'mma hit the city and sigh-see 
 Lot of imitators, you can tell them to bite these 
 Hide these on the sideline, like Spike Lee 
 I'm playing outta town, someone tell them to invite me 
 My flight leaves early tomorrow, let's get acquainted 
 The town's looking kinda dull, it's time to paint it 
 Walking around this whole spot like we made it 
 If they ain't talking about us, we will name it 
 Don't give a fuck who they put up on the A list 
 See, anything we don't like, we replace it 
 Change it, rearrange it, what's your favorite drink? 
 Once you take the shot this what we be chasing 
 With, don't make a dif', yeah, you in the basic 
 Chick, tryna get the grip, this is what it is 
 Don't be blinded by the lights 
 Killing day, we up all night 
 Pour it up, girl, it's all right 
 I just gotta know 
 You wanna be my main squeeze, baby? 
 I gotta know 
 Will you give me what I need, baby? 
 I just gotta know 
 You wanna be my main squeeze, baby? 
 I gotta know 
 Will you give me what I need, baby? 
 I just gotta know 
 Yeah, get it right, roll with the winners 
 And if anybody asks, you don't know when you'll be finished 
 Ain't nobody business and you can say ah, just ain't no limits 
 This is my piece here, I be a hard act to follow 
 Probably heard when I see the bank balance tomorrow 
 For now it don't matter, it's no jetter ...ain't got no talent and no manners 
 I'm no fan of and don't dabble in scrub shit 
 So if you need a cab you won't have to cover it 
 Just pour it up, pour it up like Rihanna 
 Good girl gone bad, Charlotte to Samantha 
 Sex and the City fan, I know you can hand with 
 This, any photo looks good if the angle fits 
 But you final, you don't need no camera tricks 
 Tryna get the grips, just what it is 
 Don't be blinded by the lights 
 Killing day, we up all night 
 Pour it up, girl, it's all right 
 I just gotta know 
 You wanna be my main squeeze, baby? 
 I gotta know 
 Will you give me what I need, baby? 
 I just gotta know 
 You wanna be my main squeeze, baby? 
 I gotta know 
 Will you give me what I need, baby? 
 I just gotta know
