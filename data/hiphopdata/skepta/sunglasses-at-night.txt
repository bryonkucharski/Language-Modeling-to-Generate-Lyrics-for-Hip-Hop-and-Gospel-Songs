I wear my sunglasses at night 
 Roses are red, Skepta, violets are blue 
 I wear my sunglasses at night 
 And girl, better know I got my eyes on you 
 I wear my sunglasses at night 
 Roses are red, violets are blue 
 You know I got my eyes on you 
 I wear my sunglasses at night 
 Roses are red, violets are blue 
 You know I got my eyes on you 
 I wear my own glasses 
 Man see me outside I want passes 
 But if your name ain't down 
 You ain't coming in, there's no two ways about it 
 Roses are red, violets are blue 
 Can you see me 'cause I can see you? 
 I don't want a table, look at the view 
 It's my party, look at the queue 
 Put your sunglasses on 
 Dance with me to my glasses song 
 I'm too extra, girls say Skepta 
 Tell me where you get your glasses from, please? 
 Garry knows Ned, Garry knows me 
 Pull up outside with JME 
 And TI please for the VIP 
 'Cause we ain't leavin' till half past three 
 I wear my sunglasses at night 
 Roses are red, violets are blue 
 You know I got my eyes on you 
 I wear my sunglasses at night 
 Roses are red, violets are blue 
 You know I got my eyes on you 
 I wear my sunglasses at night 
 Roses are red, violets are blue 
 You know I got my eyes on you 
 I wear my sunglasses at night 
 Roses are red, violets are blue 
 You know I got my eyes on you 
 I wear my sunglasses at night 
 I wear my sunglasses at night 
 I wear my sunglasses at night 
 Roses are red, violets are blue 
 You know I got my eyes on you 
 I wear my sunglasses at night 
 Roses are red, violets are blue 
 You know I got my eyes on you
