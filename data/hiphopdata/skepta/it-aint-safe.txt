It ain't safe for the block, not even for the cops 
 It ain't safe for the block, not even for the cops 
 It ain't safe for the block, not even for the cops 
 It ain't safe for the block, not even for the cops 
 It ain't safe for the block, not even for the cops 
 It ain't safe for the block, not even for the cops 
 It ain't safe for the block, not even for the cops 
 It ain't safe for the block, not even for the cops 
 It ain't safe 
 Packs, I sold, had them buzzing on the road 
 Crack residue in the buttons on my phone 
 Black leather boots when I run into your home 
 Ring, ring, pussy, it's your mummy on the phone 
 Niggas wanna kill me, tell them "Go and get your uzi" 
 Bari got the weapon in the pocket of the Ksubi's 
 See me on the catwalk, you see me in the movies 
 Still you can end up dead when you disrespect the goonies 
 It ain't safe for the block, not even for the cops 
 It ain't safe for the block, not even for the cops 
 It ain't safe for the block, not even for the cops 
 It ain't safe for the block, not even for the cops 
 It ain't safe for the block, not even for the cops 
 It ain't safe for the block, not even for the cops 
 It ain't safe for the block, not even for the cops 
 It ain't safe for the block, not even for the cops 
 It ain't safe 
 The traphouse was a shithole, with my niggas 
 Smokin' on some indo, looking for the police through the window 
 Said I'll be a minute, of course I was an hour 
 Never disturb a baker when he's mixing up the flour 
 Devour these criminals, stepping on my toes 
 I step into the party, I let everybody know 
 The heat will bang for a legend on the roads 
 So keep your hands off my bredrins and my clothes 
 It ain't safe for the block, not even for the cops 
 It ain't safe for the block, not even for the cops 
 It ain't safe for the block, not even for the cops 
 It ain't safe for the block, not even for the cops 
 It ain't safe for the block, not even for the cops 
 It ain't safe for the block, not even for the cops 
 It ain't safe for the block, not even for the cops 
 It ain't safe for the block, not even for the cops 
 It ain't safe 
 You say you always got the toast 
 But when you see my niggas you look like you see a ghost 
 These niggas follow fashion, don't look comfy in their clothes 
 See them on the roads getting lovey dovey with the hoes 
 I'll put you in your place, forreal, you disrespect the clique 
 Bang brrrang dang dang, on my Lil B shit 
 From SoHo to the heights, they're fuckin' with me heavy 
 They know me and my gang, we're the realest on the telly 
 It ain't safe for the block, not even for the cops 
 It ain't safe for the block, not even for the cops 
 It ain't safe for the block, not even for the cops 
 It ain't safe for the block, not even for the cops 
 It ain't safe for the block, not even for the cops 
 It ain't safe for the block, not even for the cops 
 It ain't safe for the block, not even for the cops 
 It ain't safe for the block, not even for the cops 
 It ain't safe
