You see the four best crews in the game I'm in them 
 If you don't like me do something then 
 10 minute screw faces I ain't in them 
 I want paper; divi divi wages I ain't in them 
 My crew put five £20 notes in a roulette machine and spin them 
 Anybody get rude I'll clench my fist and chin them 
 Forget a mash, Forget a clash, they're trash; I'll bin them 
 I don't wanna lyrical swing, I will physically swing them 
 That's why I haven't clashed anybody since "long son den some win seng" 
 If I hear man say my name I'll ring them 
 If I hear any skeng talk on my 3310 I'll find out where they are and link them 
 Headlock power-drive and pin them 
 I spy with my little eye 
 Something beginning with a capital P 
 Pu, Pu, Paper, that's what I see 
 Paper, Paper, that's what I see 
 I spy with my little eye 
 Something beginning with a capital P 
 Pu, Pu, Paper that's what I see 
 Paper, Paper that's what I see 
 More, more, more money more paper more, more money more paper 
 I wanna see more dough then a baker 
 Run tings like Ninjaman and Cartelli in jamaica, promoters pay me nuff paper 
 You know me man, the only man who could ever give me a bill is a waiter 
 Skepta heavy, heavy like pacer, I like the way things are going now 
 I gotta start collecting the dough in 
 I used to only get bookings in the UK now 
 Me and my crews boarding the 747 Boeing 
 I gotta get that dollar get that euro get that yen 
 Come back to England fit that again 
 I repeat fit that again! 
 I spy with my little eye 
 Something beginning with a capital P 
 Pu, Pu, Paper, that's what I see 
 Paper, Paper, that's what I see 
 I spy with my little eye 
 Something beginning with a capital P 
 Pu, Pu, Paper that's what I see 
 Paper, Paper that's what I see 
 I work hard everyday, I won't stop grime until everything's kosher 
 Until I got the house on the hill that looks like the one on the holiday brochure 
 I want power but it can't be solar, I've always wanted to be a high roller 
 When I was young I had to get Nike I couldn't get Gola 
 I had name brands when I was on my stroller 
 I'm a big man now so I want a bow tie and a bowler 
 Forget Ps like Diddy, I wanna make Ps just like Coca-Cola 
 For the big house in Angola, and the big Range Rover 
 And the P's legit so it don't really matter if police wanna come an try pull man over 
 I spy with my little eye 
 Something beginning with a capital P 
 Pu, Pu, Paper, that's what I see 
 Paper, Paper, that's what I see 
 I spy with my little eye 
 Something beginning with a capital P 
 Pu, Pu, Paper that's what I see 
 Paper, Paper that's what I see
