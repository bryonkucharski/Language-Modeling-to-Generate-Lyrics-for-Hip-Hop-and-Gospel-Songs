Lookin' for me? 
 Konnichiwa 
 Lookin' for me? 
 Konnichiwa 
 Lookin' for me? 
 Konnichiwa 
 Konnichiwa 
 By now you should know I hate waitin' 
 I got no patience 
 Right now man are tryna get out the matrix 
 Far from the agents 
 Tryna stay far from the devil in the red dress 
 Far from the pagans 
 Only time man are gonna see me again 
 Is if I share location 
 'Cause when you are talkin' 'bout me online 
 I was down in the basement 
 Ex girl said that I'm never at home 
 So she found a replacement 
 Said, "You was on the road 
 But I never seen you when I was out on the pavement" 
 The police wanna set me up 
 They wanna take me down to the station 
 But I can't complain 
 Soon as I get bored, I jump on the plane 
 Nothin' ain't changed 
 Boy better know a man went to the BRITs on a train 
 Think it's a game 
 Man shutdown Wireless, then I walked home in the rain 
 Then we took it back to Africa 
 Ask Wizkid, I can't explain 
 Never knew that I was gonna pop 
 Pop like 5th of November 
 Tell the President we ain't forgot 
 Tell the Prime Minister we still remember 
 Man don't care what colour or gender 
 Nobody's votin' for your corrupted agenda 
 Fix up, look sharp when I enter 
 And talk with respect when you discuss me 
 A lot of these MCs disgust me 
 Real talk, you ain't best MC in the country 
 And if you don't like it then fuck me 
 Not literally, but fuck me 
 How many more MCs do I kill till they 
 Realize there's nobody above me 
 I killed every song that I touched 
 And I turned into MC Hammer, they can't touch me 
 I be killin' it, over 10 years on the road 
 That's a permanent mark, they can't smudge me 
 Teachers used to diss me 
 Now when I touch the road I make history 
 Tried to assassinate me, but they missed me 
 You could never blacklist me 
 Nah, last year man lost a yute and my heart turned cold 
 Dem man lost Lukey and my heart just froze 
 'Cause when the casket closed 
 I'm like really what's the use of these cars and clothes? 
 If man don't wanna switch up, I'ma go hard on my own 
 Cause by now you should know I hate waitin' 
 I got no patience 
 Right now man are tryna get out the matrix 
 Far from the agents 
 Tryna stay far from the devil in the red dress 
 Far from the pagans 
 Only time man are gonna see me again 
 Is if I share location
