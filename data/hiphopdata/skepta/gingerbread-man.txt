I'm frosting, 
 I don't need a man to make my life sweet, 
 Prince Charming just isn't the one that I think I need, 
 You're thirsty, you think I give out my shit for free, 
 I'm bursting out laughing at idiocy 
 I need a gingerbread man, the one I'll feed, 
 The gingerbread man, the one I'll eat, 
 One who's always crazy, never calls me baby, 
 That's the one that I want, 
 All you boys are not him 
 Can't you see? 
 I only want the ones who never see me, 
 But I'm happy, I love playing these games until my heart bleeds, 
 It bleeds jelly 'cause you don't want someone to eat your cookie, 
 Can someone please find help for me, find him for me? 
 I need a gingerbread man, the one I'll feed, 
 The gingerbread man, the one I'll eat, 
 One who's always crazy, never calls me baby, 
 That's the one that I want, 
 All you boys are not him 
 I'm the icing covering his body, 
 I wanna hold him so close, so tightly, 
 Baby, how do I say this politely? 
 Love me hard and don't be nice, please 
 I wanna feel your crumbs on my body, 
 I want to break you in pieces, like me, 
 Baby, don't be so scared of bitting, 
 Wanna eat each other into nothing 
 I need a gingerbread man, the one I'll feed, 
 The gingerbread man, the one I'll eat, 
 One who's always crazy, never calls me baby, 
 That's the one that I want, 
 All you boys are not him
