 Yeah, see me on the front cover of the magazine 
 Winning, Sheen 
 Slept on me when I had a dream 
 I was singing "What you mean, what you mean?" 
 Now you woulda thought that it was Halloween 
 How I'm killin' all these niggas in the scene 
 Got the X, got the purple, got the green 
 Cause everyday manaman a get lean 
 Yeah, I'm a lay down some laws 
 Hold up, pause 
 Tell my lawyer "fam, look at that clause" 
 Why's the contract looking like fraud? 
 A&R looking like a shark 
 Front teeth lookin' like Jaws 
 Telling me about all these numbers 
 Then how come they are never on tour? 
 Just...

 Smell that, wow 
 Me and P fuckin' up another sound (yeah) 
 This one shouldn't be allowed (Yeah, yeah) 
 Never thought you would see me with the crown 
 Never thought you'd be seeing me around 
 Knew we were on the same flight 
 You never thought you would see me in the lounge 
 This year man are tryna get cheques 
 Before that I'm tryna get the respect 
 Stepped out in my new creps 
 One sec, flex 
 I just wanna talk to the youts 
 Nah, I don't wanna talk to the press 
 All these numbers are making me depressed 
 Give dem man a fake email address 
 Man, just...

 My accountant countin' my cabbage, also countin' my carrots 
 Vegetarian habits since BBC was established 
 Richard Mille's a classic, sapphires, not plastic 
 Like magnifying glasses, when the light hit it, nigga's ashes 
 The LaFerrari's a carriage, equipped with more, not baggage 
 One thousand thirty-five horsepower stallions 
 The yellow diamonds kept clashin', so we made the rainbow teeth happen 
 Chanel, Pharrell, it's funny as hell, to my nigga's in heaven just laughin' 
 So just...
