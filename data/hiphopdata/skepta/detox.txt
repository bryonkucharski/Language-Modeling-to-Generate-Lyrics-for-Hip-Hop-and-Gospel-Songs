Every day man turn up to the max 
 Don't know how to relax 
 Went to the hills tryna kick back 
 Still I wanna tweet and chat 
 Woke up this morning, said I quit smoking 
 Now I just bought me a pack 
 Cause every day man turn up to the max 
 Don't know how to relax 
 Pass me the weed, pass me the drink 
 Pass me a bill 
 Got cold feet and I can't sit still 
 Do what I want 'cause I got no chill 
 Yeah, you know the deal cuh man are true raver 
 I've been on more waves than a sailor 
 Man a turn up all over the radar 
 They know about Short Man in Jamaica 
 Care about now, don't care about later 
 But that's just the way that I live 
 Anywhere that I go, man are blazing a spliff 
 Bouncers are like "man are taking the piss" 
 Ace Hotel, know what it is 
 Turning down is a myth 
 Call me the turn up king 
 There's not a place that I won't turn up in 
 14 when I started smoking bud 
 Ever since way back then 
 See that buzz? Yeah, man are tryna get that again 
 I broke my turn down button so man can't press that again 
 Brand new tracksuit looking all jet black again 
 Said I quit smoking 
 But I'm in the Ace Hotel with the jetpack again 
 I remember when Wiley told me to jump on mic 
 And I got stage fright 
 Never thought I could jump on right 
 Thought I would jump on light 
 Now I'm like an air hostess how I jump on the flight 
 Sky scanner, I rocket on sight 
 Never stay in the same place for too long 
 You wanna find me? Start looking online 
 Every day man turn up to the max 
 Don't know how to relax 
 Went to the hills tryna kick back 
 Still I wanna tweet and chat 
 Woke up this morning, said I quit smoking

 Cause every day man turn up to the max 
 Don't know how to relax 
 I go so hard 
 Mum told me I should take it easy 
 Sorry, mum, I am a grime star 
 And you know my ting stay off the heezy 
 Please believe me, respect the turn up 
 Boy Better Know any time we turn up 
 It's mad, empty bottles of Hennessy 
 Still I'm on point, slap two at my enemy 
 This year, I tried to turn down couple time 
 Fam, who am I kidding? 
 Told my girl I'mma stop smoking 
 With a zoot in my hand, just ready to bill it 
 When I'm riding the riddim, no time for the -isms 
 I'm high in the sky like a pigeon 
 See them man there? Them man are some them man there's 
 They can see but they got no vision 
 When we turn up, them man can't turn up 
 Too much Henney in my cup 
 Bottle down to the halfway level, not above 
 Look, now manaman's ready for the club 
 Them man can't ride the wave I surf 
 I drink out the bottle, I'm tryna get burse 
 Drink out the bottle like a baby (?) 
 15 shots, I'm tryna get murked 
 Man's on a wave, Dagenham Dave 
 Man violate, get a punch in your face 
 Boy Better Know my niggas, we set pace 
 Man turn up every night and day 
 Sometimes gotta mix the work with the play 
 My niggas don't mix the weed and yay 
 My niggas smoke on the loudest packs 
 Them man smoke farmer yardie hay 
 Every day man turn up to the max 
 Don't know how to relax 
 Went to the hills tryna kick back 
 Still I wanna tweet and chat 
 Woke up this morning, said I quit smoking 
 Now I just bought me a pack 
 Boy Better Know, free Solo 45 
 Tracksuit Mafia, active boys, baow, baow
