I noticed when I walked in 
 The room went dark 
 Somebody better call the police 
 There's a guy here with no heart 
 He said he goes by the name of Skepta 
 He's on a warpath 
 And he said if anybody touches the crown 
 He's gonna tear them apart 
 And a grime MC was telling me 
 I kill them and I put them in a cemetery 
 And if anybody thinks they're sick in the head 
 Then I'm going to rip him to shreds live on the stage like Jeremy 
 I'm going in for the kill 
 I wouldn't stop even if I had a punctured wheel 
 Got no time for the war with will 
 Squash that beef like a Forman grill 
 I got a lot of mandem looking out for me 
 The ladies, they go wild for me 
 Back to the front, left to the right 
 And everybody up in the balcony 
 You can tell by my accent that I'm straight out of London city 
 Like Wiley 
 Like Dizzee 
 Like Tinie 
 Like Trippy 
 Let's get busy, I was in forth now I'm in fifth 
 Man wished I was in port looking at a sixth 
 Instead I'm on tour 
 I fxck off the stage, encore 
 Excuse my French, bonjour 
 Je m'appelle Skepta AKA Daniel Son 
 If I'm on the bill at two 
 Then the party starts at about half past one 
 I'm a grime MC and I won't change, 
 Doing it again, doing it my own way 
 I'm a grime MC and I won't change, 
 Doing it again, doing it my own way 
 I'm a grime MC and I won't change, 
 Doing it again, doing it my own way 
 And I might recycle the bar 
 Because my material is too good to throw away 
 Doing it again, they tried to stop me but I'm doing it again 
 Skepta, yeah I'm doing it again 
 Boy Better Know yeah I'm doing it again 
 I'm, I'm doing it again 
 They tried to stop me but I'm doing it again 
 Skepta, yeah I'm doing it again 
 Boy Better Know I'm doing it again. 
 All because of the grime bars I'm spitting 
 MC's are talking about quitting 
 25 mobiles ringing, majors bidding 
 Boy Better Know chase ringing 
 I've walked with the best 
 2 fingers up to the west 
 Big S tattooed on my chest 
 Microphone champion no contest 
 A lot of man never though I would get to say my piece 
 Can't believe the singles I release 
 I climbed up the chart at light speed 
 And I'm made of myrrh I forget about Sajid 
 If it costs to be the boss 
 I pay full price 
 And I can show you my receipt 
 Scars on my body from wars in the street 
 Pain in my left arm 
 And I can't sleep 
 So I'm sitting up praying for success to come a little sooner 
 I never suck up to no one 
 I'm not a hoover 
 I come to fxck up the game like a sore looser 
 The way I turn heads 
 You would have thought that this was a reverse parking manoeuvre 
 And when you're listening to Boy Better Know, 
 You're listening to the sound of the future 
 I keep my circle tight 
 And the question everyone's asking is, "Who are you?" 
 So I gotta put these squares in the right place like a Rubiks cube 
 I'm a solider, what have you been through? 
 You and your stupid crew 
 Better remember when you're talking to a chart topper 
 You're talking to the lord of the mic part 2 
 I'm a grime MC and I won't change 
 Doing it again, doing it my own way 
 I'm a grime MC and I won't change, 
 Doing it again, doing it my own way 
 I'm a grime MC and I won't change, 
 Doing it again, doing it my own way 
 And I might recycle the bar 
 Because my material is too good to throw away 
 Doing it again, they tried to stop me but I'm doing it again 
 Skepta, yeah I'm doing it again 
 Boy Better Know yeah I'm doing it again 
 I'm, I'm doing it again 
 They tried to stop me but I'm doing it again 
 Skepta, yeah I'm doing it again 
 Boy Better Know I'm doing it again.
