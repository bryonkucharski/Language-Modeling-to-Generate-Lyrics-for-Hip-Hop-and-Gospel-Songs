Man's never been in Marquee when it's shutdown eh? Trusss me daddi 
 (Man's never been in) 
 When it's shutdown 
 That's not me and it's shutdown 
 Ring ring pussy, it's shutdown 
 Fashion week and it's shutdown 
 Went to the show sitting in the front row 
 In the black tracksuit and it's shutdown 
 Touch the road and it's shutdown 
 Boy Better Know when it's shutdown 
 Yeah, take time 
 If a man wanna try me, no time 
 Usain Bolt when I run up on stage 
 I pick up the mic and it's reload time 
 Don't know your songs but they know mine 
 That's why I got gigs just like Joe Grind 
 After the show I be rolling mine 
 Don't care 'bout the no smoking sign 
 They try to steal my vision 
 This ain't a culture, it's my religion 
 God knows I don't wanna go prison 
 But if a man wanna try me, trust me, listen 
 Me and my Gs ain't scared of police 
 We don't listen to no politician 
 Everybody on the same mission 
 We don't care about your -isms and schisms 
 'Cause it's shutdown 
 That's not me and it's shutdown 
 Ring ring pussy, it's shutdown 
 Fashion week and it's shutdown 
 Went to the show sitting in the front row 
 In the black tracksuit and it's shutdown 
 Touch the road and it's shutdown 
 Boy Better Know when it's shutdown 
 You wanna act like a G for the camera 
 You say you're Muslim, you say you're Rasta 
 Say you don't eat pork, don't eat pussy 
 Liar, you're just a actor 
 Blud, you're not on your deen 
 And if Selassie saw you he would say 
 "Blud take off the red gold and green" 
 Them man are soft just like ice cream 
 Seen? Start moving correctly 
 If you don't wanna upset me, you get me? 
 You tryna show me your Fendi 
 I told you before, this shit don't impress me 
 I bet I make you respect me 
 When you see the mandem are selling out Wembley 
 Roll deep in a blacked out Bentley 
 Pull up outside like "wah gwan sexy" 
 Yeah, and it's shutdown 
 That's not me and it's shutdown 
 Ring ring pussy, it's shutdown 
 Fashion week and it's shutdown 
 Went to the show sitting in the front row 
 In the black tracksuit and it's shutdown 
 Touch the road and it's shutdown 
 Boy Better Know when it's shutdown 
 A bunch of young men all dressed in black dancing extremely aggressively on stage, it made me feel so intimidated and it's just not what I expect to see on prime time TV 
 I'm in a different class 
 When I get through I'mma bring my dargs 
 2 by 2, man a walk on the ark 
 Sittin' at the front, just like Rosa Parks 
 Trust me, you don't wanna see me get dark 
 Upset cause man are way up right now 
 And the shit happened all so fast 
 I was in Paris, shut down l'Arc 
 New York, shut down Central Park 
 Talk about London, yo Frisco where shall I start? 
 Walked in, spat ten 16 bars 
 And each and every one of them came from the heart 
 None of my lyrics are stolen 
 "Go on then, go on then", that's my slogan 
 Wanna know how I did it with no label 
 No A-list songs, and I told them 
 Blud, I just shutdown 
 That's not me and it's shutdown 
 Ring ring pussy, it's shutdown 
 Fashion week and it's shutdown 
 Went to the show sitting in the front row 
 In the black tracksuit and it's shutdown 
 Touch the road and it's shutdown 
 Boy Better Know when it's shutdown 
 Link up Daddy 
 All right 
 Yo tomorrow I'm gonna come scoop you, we'll go to Biz's 
 Yeah for sure 
 All right 
 Dun know
