She told me that I talk nonsense, 
 She said I never boost her confidence, 
 She came home wearing a brand new dress, 
 But I never gave her a compliment, 
 No emotion, no attention, 
 She wants me to pop the question, 
 But I never said a word, 
 Not even a mention, 
 That's why they call me a bad boy 
 They call me a bad boy 
 They call me a bad (x4) 
 They call me a bad boy 
 I know she knows I know she ain't the one, 
 She calls me every name under the sun, 
 Wasteman, lazy, she's mad; she's crazy, 
 She ain't the girl that you wanna lie to, 
 But like a fool one day I still try to, 
 Like, I never forgot your birthday, 
 I was just trying to surprise you, 
 She told me that I talk nonsense, 
 She said I never boost her comfidence, 
 She came home wearing a brand new dress 
 But I never gave her a compliment, 
 No emotion no attention, 
 She wants me to pop the question, 
 But I never said a word 
 Not even a mention 
 That's why they call me a bad boy 
 They call me a bad boy 
 I know you're buff, I know you're pretty, 
 But listen up honey, I'm not billy, 
 You're too deep in love, 
 You need to jump out the water like free willy 
 'Cause all you do is just moan and complain, 
 It was all good when your friend came, 
 But any time my friends wanna come around, 
 You start going insane in the membrane, 
 She told me that I talk nonsense, 
 She said I never boost her comfidence, 
 She came home wearing a brand new dress 
 But I never gave her a compliment, 
 No emotion no attention, 
 She wants me to pop the question, 
 But I never said a word 
 Not even a mention 
 That's why they call me a bad boy 
 They call me a bad boy 
 They call me a bad (x8) 
 That's why they call me a bad boy, 
 They call me a bad (x8) 
 That's why they call me a bad boy,
