Yo babe, open the door man I'm downstairs 
 Na man I'm only joking I'm at home in my bed 
 Whith a phone on my head 
 I got a cold and a blocked nose 
 That's why I might sound like O to the Z 
 I miss you a whole heap 
 That must be the reason I can't go sleep 
 Can you imagine what it's gonna be like when I'm touring 
 I would come and stay but I got stuff to do in the morning 
 Still, I wanna say I got the world at my feet 
 But sometimes I feel like my life is complete 
 All I need is my brothers, my sisters, my dad and mum 
 Money, music, you and a asthma pump 
 You need to know that I love you 
 And there ain't another girl that I would ever put above you 
 But you never answer your phone 
 And you know I don't like leaving messages after the tone 
 Wagwan, wagwan it's me 
 You all right, I been thinking about you all night 
 What's good, how you been? 
 I keep trying to phone and keep getting your answer machine 
 I just wanna kiss you 
 Two minutes after I leave you I miss you 
 I need to hug you 
 My credits gonna run out, I phone you tomorrow 
 I love you, see you later 
 Yo babe, try and get a week off work 
 I wanna take you on holiday 
 You don't need to worry about the money 'cause I'm gonna pay 
 So let me know if that's long for you 
 I been sitting in my room all day 
 I wrote a song for you 
 You know exactly who the song's for 
 When I say apple juice, prawn toast, cinnnamon, bagels, couscous and red wine 
 And petty arguments at bed time 
 The funny thing is we wake up 
 Look at each other, laugh, kiss and make up 
 Then we get ready to go out and eat breakfast and have another argument when I see you wear makeup 
 You need to know that I love you 
 And there ain't another girl that I would ever put above you 
 But you never answer your phone 
 And you know I don't like leaving messages after the tone 
 What's going on 
 I hope you never forgot to take your micro ...? on 
 I wanna take you out for dinner later 
 So make sure you wear the white jacket with the pink lines on 
 Or the black dress 
 'Cause when you wear it you look like an actress 
 But I think you look even better on the mattress 
 With the dress on the floor, no underwear, bottle of champers 
 Me and you head to head, skin to skin, body to body 
 You know thing to thing 
 The way you move your hips says everything 
 You ain't got to talk, not even move your lips 
 You need to know that I love you 
 And there ain't another girl that I would ever put above you 
 But you never answer your phone 
 And you know I don't like leaving messages after the tone
