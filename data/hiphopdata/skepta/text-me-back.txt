Joseph, my GG 
 Wah gwan, G? 
 If you ever knew 
 Time, time, time 
 Sometimes I don't text you back 
 But I never mean to disrespect you 
 I'm on the road tryna do this ting 
 I know you see where man's tryna get to 
 I've been around the world and back 
 I ain't met anybody I wanna be with more than you 
 That's why when the sun goes down at night 
 Man are calling you 
 The girl of my dreams 
 You ain't tryna be part of the scene 
 And when I talk in code, you know what I mean 
 Too much style, way too clean 
 I'm in love with the way that you mix the Palace with Celine 
 How you mix the Chanel with the Preme 
 Too clean, the best piece of art I ever seen 
 The perfect picture, lost money this summer 
 So you know I've gotta grind in the winter 
 I ain't one of them wasteman tryna flex on Insta 
 I'm really out here with the axe, tryna chop down timber 
 This ain't a game like knock down ginger 
 Our love's strong like Mufasa and Simba 
 Never need to download Tinder 
 Sometimes I don't text you back 
 But I never mean to disrespect you 
 I'm on the road tryna do this ting 
 I know you see where man's tryna get to 
 I've been around the world and back 
 I ain't met anybody I wanna be with more than you 
 That's why when the sun goes down at night 
 Man are calling you 
 Sometimes I don't text you back 
 But I never mean to disrespect you 
 I'm on the road tryna do this ting 
 I know you see where man's tryna get to 
 I've been around the world and back 
 I ain't met anybody I wanna be with more than you 
 That's why when the sun goes down at night 
 Man are calling you 
 Man, I hate this phone 
 Kiss my teeth when I hear the ringtone 
 Put it on silent, leave me alone 
 Mum's like "Junior, when are you gonna come home?" 
 Mum, man's on the roads 
 Text her a love heart, text her a rose 
 I've gotta do these shows 
 'Cause I ain't tryna see another tear run down your nose 
 Nah, mum, your son's got ambition 
 Could've been dead, could've been in prison 
 But I had this vision 
 Of all the fam living in better conditions 
 So I had to go OT 
 Man, I've been OT since '03 
 And all my ex-girls know me 
 I ain't really ever gonna stop lowkey 
 'Cause I've got a big team 
 And they all want sick things, big rings like Saturn 
 Forget the fame, that's already happened 
 Man are on top 
 But I can't stop till all the mandem are patterned 
 I ain't out here following fashion 
 And ya dun know, as soon as I come home 
 We can go shopping in Hatton 
 Sometimes I don't text you back 
 But I never mean to disrespect you 
 I'm on the road tryna do this ting 
 I know you see where man's tryna get to 
 I've been around the world and back 
 I ain't met anybody I wanna be with more than you 
 That's why when the sun goes down at night 
 Man are calling you 
 Sometimes I don't text you back 
 But I never mean to disrespect you 
 I'm on the road tryna do this ting 
 I know you see where man's tryna get to 
 I've been around the world and back 
 I ain't met anybody I wanna be with more than you 
 That's why when the sun goes down at night 
 Man are calling you
