Whatchu you mean, whatchu you mean? 
 Yeah, Skepta 
 One line flows yeah I got some of those 
 You get me JME? Easy 
 Nah! 
 Nah, that's not me 
 Act like a wasteman? That's not me 
 Sex any girl? Nah that's not me 
 Lips any girl? Nah that's not me 
 Yeah, I used to wear Gucci 
 Put it all in the bin cause that's not me 
 True, I used to look like you 
 But dressing like a mess? Nah, that's not me 
 It's the return of the mack 
 I'm still alive just like 2Pac 
 Girls in the front row, girls in the back 
 Spit one lyric everybody's like brap 
 Flashback to the cold nights in the trap 
 Now I'm in a new whip counting the big stack 
 Yellow-gold chains and the diamonds are black 
 Jack me? Nah you don't wanna do that 
 Anytime you see me wearing a glove 
 Boy Better Know I ain't coming to fight like Jet Li 
 Spray this till the clip is empty 
 I know you get what I'm saying, you get me? 
 Love for the Gs in the ends 
 But we don't love no girls in the ends 
 Last time I fell in love with a sket 
 But trust me, I will never do that again 
 Nah, that's not me 
 Act like a wasteman? That's not me 
 Sex any girl? Nah that's not me 
 Lips any girl? Nah that's not me 
 Yeah, I used to wear LV 
 Put it all in the bin cause that's not me 
 True, I used to look like you 
 But dressing like a mess? Nah, that's not me 
 See me, I come from the roads 
 Pricks wanna try and put Skepta on hold 
 But no, badboy I've been one of those 
 Wake up call, you will get one of those 
 One to the eyeball, one to the nose 
 I don't really care about your postcode 
 Take your girl, no dinner no rose 
 Two minutes in my bedroom, no clothes 
 Girls everywhere, girls in the club 
 Looking at me, tryna make a black man blush 
 Girls on the high street, girls on the bus 
 But these niggas wanna hang around us, that's sus 
 I don't wanna see a Stone Island, 'cause 
 Man talk shit, I just smile and flush 
 I'm looking for a girl with an X factor 
 But I don't judge like Simon does 
 From day one I said I was serious 
 Then "Serious" hit the jackpot 
 People ask what music I make 
 Turn the volume up, cause that's what 
 I don't wear no bait designer brands 
 I spit deep bars in my black top 
 You'll never see me smoking a cigarette 
 Cah cigarette smoker that's not me 
 Nah, that's not me 
 Nah, that's not 
 When I'm on the mic in a rave 
 I got the whole crowd bubbling like a crack pot 
 See me and Skepta in a video, with a nostalgic backdrop 
 There'll never be a day when I don't make music 
 'Cause silent? Nah that's not me 
 Nah, that's not me 
 Act like a wasteman? That's not me 
 Sex any girl? Nah that's not me 
 Lips any girl? Nah that's not me 
 Yeah, I used to wear Gucci 
 I put it all in the bin cause that's not me 
 True, I used to look like you 
 But dressing like a mess? Nah, that's not me 
 Nah, that's not me 
 Act like a wasteman? That's not me 
 Sex any girl? Nah that's not me 
 Lips any girl? Nah that's not me 
 Yeah, I used to wear Gucci 
 I put it all in the bin cause that's not me 
 True, I used to look like you 
 But dressing like a mess? Nah, that's not me
