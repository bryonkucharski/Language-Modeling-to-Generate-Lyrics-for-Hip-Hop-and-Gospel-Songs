 Undisputed microphone champion, ready for any contender 
 Girls love Boy Better Know t-shirts like they love La Senza 
 So if you're wearing a Boy Better Know tee, let me see

 And if you wanna clash me, I'm there 
 Still I'm here, I'm there 
 No matter how far or near, I'm there 
 My name's on the bill, catch me, I'm there 
 And if you wanna clash me, I'm there 
 I'm never on a long ting, I'm never on a lay-lay 
 I spit a bar, man are like "mayday, mayday!" 
 I spit a lyric, it's pay day, no play play 
 These MCs better thank God for AJ 
 Boy Better Know endorsed my CD 
 I'm original, I don't Control-C 
 I only sound like me, that's why I don't wanna be the Forum's best MC cause Forum's best MC don't make no P 
 I'm known in the UK and overseas 
 Heathrow Airport know about me 
 Stanstead know my name, I don't wanna play your fastest MC game 
 I don't wanna play your skippiest MC game 
 But if you wanna clash me I'm there

 You'll see my face, in a funky dance, doing a funky dance 
 You know what I look like, you know what, fuck this -- 
 It's no introduction needed, I'm dangerous

 Next year, I'll be a baiders 
 Boy Better Know run this shit, ask the majors 
 Trust me, I'm gonna win Wiley 
 Fuck a snake and crane, these other MCs don't think like me 
 Buy out the bar or drink like me 
 I drop so much shit, they wish they could stink like me 
 Have Sidewinder on lock like me 
 Be losing a clash, that is not like me 
 I'm a stage show don, if you don't believe me, put the stage show on 
 See me performing on the same stage Dizzee and Kano's on 
 Nobody's ever played your song ever since it came out 
 These MCs have got bare mixtapes out, and they're still window shopping 
 I've got a new song, new album and a new single dropping 
 So when I drop my album, Halifax knows what's popping 
 I'm laughing straight to the bank with it 
 And I'm standing tall, wipe your Size 6, 7, 9s, Big Dada and Dirtee Stank with it 
 You know what I'm gone, I've got a flight to catch
