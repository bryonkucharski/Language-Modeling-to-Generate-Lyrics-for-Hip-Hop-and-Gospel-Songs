Please don't have to make me go in to detail 
 When I say I came out of my dads hone 
 Now I'm in a race with these tadpoles, speeding through the fallopian 
 I need to beat all the rest of these babies 
 Mum had a positive pregnancy test last week 
 Two months down the line I've got a heartbeat 
 But I got a piece of skin between my legs man, I can't be a daughter 
 I'm breathing, but I'm in a bag of water 
 Foods coming through my umbilical cord, the years 1-9-8-2 
 I can't wait to make my debut 
 I hope I got one of them good mums 
 Nineteenth day of the ninth my day comes 
 I finally come out after hours of trying 
 The nurse slap me, then I started crying 
 Couple hours later, I'm in a incubator 
 A bit bigger than an A4 sheet of paper 
 Loads of people kept coming up to me and saying "goo goo ga ga" 
 Why can't they speak to me properly? 
 I'm a celebrity, get me out of here 
 Mum don't forget your Lucozade, flowers and your grapes 
 These giants keep coming in different sizes and shapes 
 And talking to me like I'm from the Planet of the Apes 
 But, it don't matter, I got the X Factor 
 Even Simon Cowell knows I'm the best rapper 
 We left mother's hospital went to the flat in Old Street 
 Then my mum got cold feet 
 We had a problem, I kept climbing on the windowsill 
 So we moved to a house in Tottenham 
 Got chicken pox so we went to the surgery 
 Couple years past picky skin fade in nursery 
 Sitting in class playing with Fisher Price tools 
 Two two; s I moved to Primary school 
 I went to the school next door to Northumberland 
 My piece changed from a little hot dog into a Cumberland 
 Ready to feed it to the big chicks 
 Secondary school I was a bad boy at English 
 If you listened to Jungle you was top boy in form 
 Then all of a sudden some new music was born 
 I need to, have a name or something 
 This Machino Joe shit ain't the one man 
 What should I change my name to? 
 I need to be a king in this, or some kinda like wizard or something 
 Yeah yeah, Sceptre, Sceptre 
 Yeah Sceptre on the mic 
 Nah nah nah 
 I need to change the spelling of that 
 Wait 
 S-C, no 
 S-K-E, S-K-E-P-T-A 
 Skepta, Skepta 
 Yeah that's me blud 
 Skepta, whut 
 S-K-E-P-T-A, yeah 
 (Serious, big boy soldier)
