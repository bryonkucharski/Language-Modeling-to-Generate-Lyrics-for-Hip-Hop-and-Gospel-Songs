The feds wanna shift man 
 Wanna put me in the van, wanna strip a man 
 Fuck that, I ain't a chippendale 
 Wanna strip a male 
 Put me in a prison cell 
 Got me biting all my fingernails 
 Sitting in my hotel, listening to beats 
 My bredrin said that he's in the rave, told me that I should reach 
 So I jumped in the shower, got ready quick 
 Pulled up in a taxi, text my bredrin, tell him I'm on the strip 
 I stepped in, went to the bar, made my order 
 I got my drink, I posted up in the darkest corner 
 This guy frantically jumping around and spilled my drink twice 
 But I really ain't tryna fight, really ain't tryna see no jail tonight 
 The feds wanna shift man 
 Wanna put me in the van, wanna strip a man 
 Fuck that, I ain't a chippendale 
 Wanna strip a male 
 Put me in a prison cell 
 Got me biting all my fingernails 
 Feds wanna shift man 
 Wanna put me in the van, wanna strip a man 
 Fuck that, I ain't a chippendale 
 Wanna strip a male 
 Put me in a prison cell 
 Got me biting all my fingernails 
 What the fuck? This pussyhole must've been off his nut 
 In the cut, jumping around like a little slut 
 I pulled him up, "yo, you spilt my Hennessy out my cup" 
 And still tryna run it up, it's like this guy really wants to scuff 
 Flexing like he had something on the waist 
 Pull Shorty out the way, blaow, punch him in the face 
 Made him Shmoney dance, I made him rock away 
 We ran out of the dance, we could've got away 
 But we came back, should've gone home and hit the sack 
 But he never hit me back, I was like "that's a wrap", fuck that 
 Shorty found some gritty tings to keep us company 
 Then the feds run up on me and put the cuffs on me 
 What you know about four man in a cell? Couldn't sleep 
 Spending pennies in the pissing well 
 You should see my cell mate, he's in shit as well 
 Sitting here, just waiting to hear keys in the door 
 I'm tryna buss this case even if I gotta get on my knees in the court, crazy 
 Trust me, Decs 
 Fucking hell, bredda, man 
 You actually got nicked? 
 Man, dickhead ting, fighting ting, fam. Look at my knuckle 
 Fucking hell, what? Strip-searched and? 
 Fam, not gonna lie, fam. Strip-searched, they made me liff up... 
 The feds wanna shift man

 So what, what happened, then? So what's the settings now, bruv? 
 Well, man, I was just grovelling to the magistrates, man. Literally just begging for my life bruv
