I don't know why man's callin' me family all of a sudden 
 Like hmm, my mum don't know your mum 
 Stop telling man you're my cousin 
 I got day ones and I got new ones 
 No fake ones, trust no one 
 It's Boy Better Know till I die 
 Tryna run up in the bank like Bonnie and Clyde 
 Cause man get money with the gang 
 Man get girls with the gang 
 Man eat food with the gang 
 Man talk slang to the feds 
 Can't work out what I just said to a man 
 Told me you was a big fan but the first thing you said when you saw me is "Can I get a pic for the gram?" 
 I was like "Nah, sorry man" 
 I only socialize with the crew and the gang 
 Whoa, guess who's back 
 Came a long way from sittin' in the flats 
 Came a long way from when whites never used to mix with blacks 
 Now all my white niggas and my black mates, we got the game on smash 
 I used to rate your page on MySpace but you never stayed on track 
 Upset cause your wife is a fan, she done with a little boy 
 Now she wants to be with a man 
 Told my accountant "Do me a transfer, 'cause I wanna buy some land" 
 You and I have got different plans 
 Real mad man, I might go Saint Ann's 
 No triple A pass, no wristbands 
 You are not mandem, you are not gang 
 Tracksuit Mafia, Boy Better Know 
 My ones, my team 
 Meridian, bad blocks 
 London boys, active boys 
 You get me? 
 Man get money with the gang 
 Man get girls with the gang 
 Man eat food with the gang 
 Man talk slang to the feds 
 Can't work out what I just said to a man 
 Told me you was a big fan but the first thing you said when you saw me is "Can I get a pic for the gram?" 
 I was like "Nah, sorry man" 
 I only socialize with the crew and the gang 
 They wanna see me drown 
 Tryna hold the mandem down 
 'Cause I shutdown Shoreditch car park 
 And I got bars like Camden Town 
 Out there tryna survive on the streets 
 Tryin' not to get killed by the police 
 And I be schoolin' MC's 
 Nobody leaves till half-past-three 
 This year I'mma teach them a lesson 
 Tell Grace don't reply to those emails 
 Nah, I don't wanna do no sessions 
 It's like them man have got an obsession with my style of expression 
 But in public, never hear my name mentioned 
 Catch them at the nightclub entrance 
 Always seekin' attention 
 But I be inside, tryna get burst 
 Lookin' all cool like Herc 
 Dressed like I just come from P.E 
 You're dressed like you just come from church 
 Better do your research 
 You don't wanna hear my verse come after your verse 
 MCs act brand new 'cause they got a little money in their purse 
 So you had a good solo career? 
 Had a few big songs over the years? 
 Back then you was a real Top Boy 
 But right now fam, nobody cares 
 Walked in the club, everybody's like 
 "Who is he? Why is he walkin' around with security?" 
 You know the postcode when you're talkin' road 
 Better know that I speak that fluently 
 I don't know why man's callin' me family all of a sudden 
 Like hmm, my mum don't know your mum 
 Stop telling man you're my cousin 
 I got day ones and I got new ones 
 No fake ones, trust no one 
 It's Boy Better Know till I die 
 Tryna run up in the bank like Bonnie and Clyde 
 Cause 
 Man get money with the gang 
 Man get girls with the gang 
 Man eat food with the gang 
 Man talk slang to the feds 
 Can't work out what I just said to a man 
 Told me you was a big fan but the first thing you said when you saw me is "Can I get a pic for the gram?" 
 I was like "Nah, sorry man"
