Come off the stage! Move! 
 They don't want to hear you! They don't want to hear you! 
 What, is that what you think? Is that what you think? 
 Oi blud, calm, calm, calm 
 Lyrics for lyrics, calm 
 Yeah, hear me on the radio, wah gwan? 
 See me on the TV, hi mum 
 Murk MCs when the mic's in my palm 
 Lyrics for lyrics, calm 
 Hear me on the radio, wah gwan? 
 See me on the TV, hi mum 
 Murk MCs when the mic's in my palm 
 Lyrics for lyrics, calm 
 Yeah, you got murked last week 
 Couldn't even get a rewind, that's peak 
 Couldn't get out your punchlines on time 
 Now you wanna diss me? Oh blud, what a cheek 
 Sidewinder, you got air on the roads 
 Eskimo Dance, you was spitting off-beat 
 Lord of the Mics, you was spitting that heat 
 But right now, your bars ain't on fleek 
 You don't wanna clash me, you will get murked 
 Bury MCs six feet in the dirt 
 I know you saw the police outside 
 You saw the blood on Devilman's shirt 
 Got rude, that didn't work 
 And your girl looks like she don't work 
 Mental 
 Man wouldn't beat that even if I was burse 
 Yeah, hear me on the radio, wah gwan? 
 See me on the TV, hi mum 
 Murk MCs when the mic's in my palm 
 Lyrics for lyrics, calm 
 Hear me on the radio, wah gwan? 
 See me on the TV, hi mum 
 Murk MCs when the mic's in my palm 
 Lyrics for lyrics, calm 
 Them man are fake, them man are sus 
 I'm the boss these pagans wanna touch 
 I'm the kind of boss that the opps gotta rush 
 'Cause I make it ring something like bells on the bus 
 1 on 1, fair and square, man are fucked 
 Swinging out my sword, swinging out my nunchuks 
 Running out of corn? Man'll get a gun buck 
 Tell a pussyhole look sharp, fix up 
 Where you from? Huh, what's wrong? 
 What's going on? Why you got your screwface on? 
 Dead that, forget that 
 Diss track? Nobody wanna hear that song 
 Better get your thinking hats on 
 You don't wanna diss me, that's long 
 'Cause I'm a don, lyrically gone 
 You want to clash but you're gonna get banged on 
 Yeah, hear me on the radio, wah gwan? 
 See me on the TV, hi mum 
 Murk MCs when the mic's in my palm 
 Lyrics for lyrics, calm 
 Hear me on the radio, wah gwan? 
 See me on the TV, hi mum 
 Murk MCs when the mic's in my palm 
 Lyrics for lyrics, calm 
 Yo, I'm a king, lyrically ming 
 You want to clash but you're gonna get tucked in 
 Truth of the buck ting when I bucked in 
 (?) Draw side's right where I bucked in 
 Don't really care if you go to gym 
 Get put down by the lead like drawing 
 To kick your door in, anybody snoring 
 When I bore in's gonna get a full face 
 Full of piss you're in, deep shit you're in 
 N-O-V-D-D-D that you're warring 
 Not gonna be me that you're boring 
 I'm gonna jack manaman, take your rings 
 And all of your bling, Lewisham king 
 It's not a ting to draw the ting if you wanna swing 
 But if you get jooked, don't sing 
 Not a long ting to do the hype ting 
 Yeah, hear me on the radio, wah gwan? 
 See me on the TV, hi mum 
 Murk MCs when the mic's in my palm 
 Lyrics for lyrics, calm 
 Hear me on the radio, wah gwan? 
 See me on the TV, hi mum 
 Murk MCs when the mic's in my palm
