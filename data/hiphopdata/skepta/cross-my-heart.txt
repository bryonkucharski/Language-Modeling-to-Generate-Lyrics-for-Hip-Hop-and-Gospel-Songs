(Preeya Kalidas - Chorus) 
 Strobe Lights flashing in my eyes 
 Living for this moment and now I realise 
 I'll never tell a lie lie lie 
 I'll never let 'em in I leave 'em on the outside 
 (Boy Better know) 
 I promise you, I promise you, yeah 
 (The truth) 
 I promise you I promise you, yeah 
 (Skepta) 
 Cross my heart until the day I die 
 (Skepta Verse 1) 
 I've been around the World and back 
 Screaming more money more paper 
 Been doing it major 
 Even Walkers ain't go this much flavour 
 They say I'm superbad like Mclovin 
 Now man are calling me family all of a sudden 
 And I'm like mum how come you never told me that I had all these cousins 
 This corner I'm standing in never felt claustrophobic when I came in 10 minutes ago 
 Now my backs against the wall 
 It's a good job I'm tall 
 So I can always see clear 
 Even with all the smoke in the air 
 I know some are standing here cause of loving fame 
 But some of them are here out of fear 
 (Skepta Verse 2) 
 It's time to go straight back to the top with them 
 They tried to stop me but I'm doing it again 
 And all my real friends know Ima still keep it 10 multiplied by 10 
 Forgive me if I've been acting a little strange 
 I never knew that one song could make my whole life change 
 Last week I boarded six planes 
 But I can't complain this is the moment I've been waiting for 
 Picked myself off the floor and now I get a warm welcome when I walked in the door 
 I'm with Boy Better Know let 'em all in 
 There's a flip side to all things 
 So before you sign yourself up to the high life 
 Make sure you read the small print 
 Listen, please 
 Listen to me when I'm talking 
 The guy you're looking at right now is the guy I was this morning 
 I never had a pen but I made a mark 
 Even when I top the chart I'll be the same guy that I was at the start 
 I hope to die I cross my heart
