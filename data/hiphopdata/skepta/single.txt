And this tune is for all the single ladies 
 We just wanna know 
 Are you gonna take us home tonight 
 Can you take us home please 
 We'll be out in the morning 
 I swear 
 It's Friday night, time to get dressed 
 Raving time, just to impress 
 Make sure your hair don't look like a mess 
 Got a little spray, gotta stay fresh 
 Bad to the bone 
 If you ain't got a haircut, draw for your afro comb 
 Got you car keys and your mobile phone 
 That's how you get girls to take you home 
 Just because the lady looks cute 
 She took more phone numbers than the loot 
 So before you knock boots 
 Make sure you put on your hat with your birthday suit 
 She wants you to come around and stay 
 She said a one night stand's okay 
 I'd say what Clint Eastwood would say 
 "Go ahead, make my day" 
 If you're single, then mingle 
 If he's buff, put his number inside your mobile phone 
 If you wanna take him home 
 Go one then, go one then 
 If you're single, then mingle 
 If he's buff, put his number inside your mobile phone 
 If you wanna take him home 
 Go one then, go one then 
 Some girls wear pink, some wear brown 
 Some wear more makeup than a clown 
 But before you start looking around 
 Cloak room time, draw for the pound 
 Put in your coat, look for the ladies 
 Single ladies, one's with Bailey's 
 White, black, I don't really care 
 Long as you were born in the early 80's 
 Just because the lady looks cute 
 She took more phone numbers than the loot 
 So before you knock boots 
 Make sure you put on your hat with your birthday suit 
 All these questions hurting my head 
 She want's to know if I'm live or dead 
 So I said what Shabba Ranks said 
 "I am bad, mad and wicked in a bed" 
 If you're single, then mingle 
 If he's buff, put his number inside your mobile phone 
 If you wanna take him home 
 Go one then, go one then 
 If you're single, then mingle 
 If he's buff, put his number inside your mobile phone 
 If you wanna take him home 
 Go one then, go one then 
 I don't understand why every girl 
 Thinks a one night stand is the end of the world 
 I ain't asking for your hand in marriage 
 I just want a ride in your horse and carriage 
 That was a disrespect, I apologise, I don't mean to be cruel 
 But what do you expect when you come to the rave with four footballs 
 Just because the lady looks cute 
 She took more phone numbers than the loot 
 So before you knock boots 
 Make sure you put on your hat with your birthday suit 
 I ain't gonna run back and tell my whole crew 
 I'm a big man, I'm 22 
 We'll do what Ja Rule and Christina do 
 "Anything we do is between me and you" 
 If you're single, then mingle 
 If he's buff, put his number inside your mobile phone 
 If you wanna take him home 
 Go one then, go one then 
 Go on then, go on then 
 Yeah if you're single just mingle man 
 If you find a buff boy 
 Put his number in your mobile phone 
 And if you wanna take him home after that 
 Take him home 
 Kick him out in the morning 
 Back to normal life innit 
 Until next Friday
