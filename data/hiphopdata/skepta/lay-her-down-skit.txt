You're telling people you don't like me 
 We don't kill this, never make a sound 
 All money get beside me 
 Shoot that motherfucker down 
 It's 30 ladies and she likes me 
 But she love that beating around 
 So when I see her 
 I swear to Jesus 
 I'mma lay her down, lay her down 
 I'mma lay her down, lay her down 
 I'mma lay her down, lay her down 
 I'mma lay her down, lay her down 
 I'mma lay her 
 Don't need to say you love me 10 times 
 I can feel it in the air 
 I just wanna be yours every night 
 And you can be my Jesse well 
 Dreams of this queen inside my bedroom 
 Wearing nothing but a crown 
 Oh when I see her 
 I swear to Jesus 
 I'mma lay her down, lay her down 
 I'mma lay her down, lay her down 
 I'mma lay her down, lay her down 
 I'mma lay her down, lay her down 
 I'mma lay her 
 Uh, get fresh then I step back 
 Beat the red button crip yeah 
 So many girls around, yell around 
 You with a fuck, it was queue profound 
 Down down down down down I lay er 
 If my girl a Buffy then I slay er 
 And if the judge, girl my dick like KT 
 Purvey then they after John Layer 
 I sweat to Jesus, no pieces 
 I cut to bullshit, no pieces 
 We're both finna whistle and flip this now 
 Fuck yo, but kinda risich 
 Young and so now we in the set 
 Got the man them on deck 
 Put the gyal to move here 
 AMG livin', cruise damage on the M 
 One when I come vrum vrum 
 I'mma lay her down 
 I just wanna feel her skin 
 Against mine 
 If it's the last thing I do 
 I swear to... I swear to Jesus 
 I'mma lay her down, lay her down 
 I'mma lay her down, lay her down 
 I'mma lay her down, lay her down 
 I'mma lay her down, lay her down 
 I'mma lay her
