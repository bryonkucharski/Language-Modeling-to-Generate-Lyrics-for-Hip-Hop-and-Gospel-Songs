It's all sticks and stones 
 Yeah, it's all sticks and stones 
 It's all sticks and stones 
 You better bring some sticks and stones 
 Yo, it's all sticks and stones 
 You better bring some sticks and stones 
 If I punch man in the face I'll make your lip lean to the left like Sylvester Stallone 
 Words can't hurt me, forget the Chinese whispers 
 Skepta's back with a brand-new banger for the listeners 
 Mandem hate cause the ladies wanna take pictures 
 I go hard from New Years Day to Christmas 
 Niggas in jail go mad for my scriptures 
 Sticks and stones 
 Man already know about me, I'm the one man soldier 
 Sticks and stones 
 You don't want beef, you want a vegetable samosa 
 Sticks and stones 
 I'll run through the strip like the race was over 
 No long ting when the war gets colder 
 I jump in like 50 in Angola 
 You get me, it's all sticks and stones 
 You better bring some sticks and stones 
 If I punch man in the face I'll make your lip lean to the left like Sylvester Stallone 
 Yeah, it's all sticks and stones 
 You better bring some sticks and stones 
 If I punch man in the face I'll make your lip lean to the left like Sylvester Stallone 
 Any time I spit a bar, I make the DJ wheel it 
 Now that I've got a little limelight, man wanna steal it 
 Better talk to the guy you thought you could jack me with 
 Anybody threaten my life, I'll beat him 
 With the same hand that I Rolex sweep with 
 Sticks and stones 
 See me in the white 350, man wanna hate me 
 Sticks and stones 
 I'm never on the hype, but I'll do a 30 for Jamie 
 Sticks and stones 
 Turn man into a ghost like Patrick Swayze 
 I just wanna make more money go crazy 
 But man wanna see me in the Old Bailey 
 Too many MCs run around, talking reckless 
 Bad thoughts in my head, now I can't sleep, I'm restless 
 Never see me roll in a 20 man gang of pretenders 
 Skepta, I'm on some one-man ventures 
 Them man have got fake beef like wrestlers 
 Sticks and stones 
 Never catch me off guard, you better do your squeezes 
 Sticks and stones 
 Die hard like a soldier, no sorry, no pleading 
 Sticks and stones 
 No wasteman's gonna stop my crew from eating 
 In the morning, afternoon and evening 
 I rep Boy Better Know until I stop breathing 
 Danger, tell these babies there's no space in the manger 
 Skepta 
 Sticks and stones break bones, words can't do nothing 
 Sticks and stones 
 Microphone Champion Skepta 
 Sticks and stones 
 2000 and everything 
 Sticks and stones 
 Straight, Boy Better Know all day long, till my heart stops beating, go on then!
