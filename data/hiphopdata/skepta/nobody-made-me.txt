See I used to think like you 
 So to diss you wouldn't be fair 
 But at the same time if I listen to what you tell me I wouldn't be here 
 Shit turns to gold when I touch it 
 So me looking at youtube comments is counter-productive 
 'Cause none of that criticism is constructive 
 So I switch off the mac like f*** this 
 You're never gonna see me switchin' 
 Another twitter account with no pic, 10 followers, following everybody he's dissing 
 I found myself now I'm missing 
 They love the grime flow I'm spitting 
 I took it to the chart now they're listening 
 I can't wait till I'm on tour I'm itchin' 
 Make some noise 
 Somebody tell Will Smith I am Legend 
 What dya know about looking in the fridge and all you can see is a white light like heaven 
 When I was young I used to beg mum for some money to buy a birthday present 
 And now parents want to book me for a sweet 16 
 I'm a birthday present 
 They didn't want to rate me 
 But all my supporters came together and saved me 
 Tears in my eyes 
 Head high, pointing to the sky 
 Screaming nobody made me, nobody made me 
 Put your hands in the air 
 For the grime MC of the year 
 Some say I came out of nowhere 
 Little d'they know it's been a four year nightmare 
 Running around with no runner 
 Had to pay for my own radio plugger 
 Watch'd everybody eating 
 While I sat there with no bread, no butter 
 I told myself I gotta do this 
 Whatever the weather I get through this 
 Long as I keep making the hits 
 My distributors gotta move those units 
 So I never gave up hoping, naa 
 Forget crying and sulking 
 They said I was too grimey 
 Now me and P. Diddy on the iChat laughing and joking 
 Make some noise 
 And I hope all you A and R's heard that 
 I got so much more that I wanna say 
 But I'm looking forward I can't turn back 
 Remember it's boy better know all year from October to September 
 We built this ourselves so the only man that can ever knock me down is Skepta 
 They didn't want to rate me 
 But all my supporters came together and saved me 
 Tears in my eyes 
 Head high, pointing to the sky 
 Screaming nobody made me, nobody made me
