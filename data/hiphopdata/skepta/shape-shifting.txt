Yeah, I wouldn't say I had a rough, rough, rough life yeah 
 But I've had some bad times 
 My son's in this music ting 
 They're always going through pure madness 
 But you know I'm happy to be Jamie and Junior's dad 
 I could have been one of these waste MCs dads 
 Not makin' no money 
 Deadout 
 My name's Joseph A-D-E-N-U-G-A 
 I love grime but I don't usually spray 
 I've got four kids and all of their names begin with a J 
 You know them, wait, what else can I say? 
 Flow tunes, you know I rep Boy Better Know all day 
 You will see me in a green Mercedes A-Class, blazing a zoot, smiling away 
 But from time to time, I look up to Allah and pray 
 That DJ Maximum, Wiley, Jamie and Junior will be okay 
 You can never die before my hair turns grey 
 Boy better know the roads ain't nice 
 So many gunshots, too many knives 
 But I heard a couple man dissing my wife so God please forgive me if I take an MCs 
 Life 
 Joseph 
 These MCs are saying a lot 
 Violating, talking about people's mums 
 But you know what, I knew Jamie and Junior was going to get into this music thing 
 I'm a big DJ 
 Printing houses, records, everywhere, I'm on Radio 1, yeah! 
 Yeah, my name's Tim West-W-double O-D 
 I'm a big dawg, these other DJs started in 2-double O-3 
 I'm on Radio 1, not Rinse 1-double O-3 
 Kiss my F-double O-T anybody tries to shut down my shop 
 Hating Westwood, 'cause I've got a new Jay-Z drops, 50 Cent drops 
 Busta Rhymes drops, so many drops, I dunno what tune to drop 
 Drop a Boy Better Know song, then drop a bomb, bang your doors 
 Real goons in the HMV locked on 
 Haters wanna shoot me and lick me down 
 They know Westwood's big in the scene, my Hummer's tinted out 
 So if you wanna see me you better look through my front windscreen 
 Timothy 
 So many haters 
 You get me, everyone's dissing Westwood 
 But as soon as their album or mixtape's gonna drop they wanna phone me and come on 
 My show 
 They didn't phone me before I made "POW!" 
 As soon as I made "POW!" all these MCs are ringing my phone 
 Yo, my names D-E-X-P-L-I-C-I-T 
 Soundboys wanna be grimy like me 
 Rip off my tune but they never wanna say 
 But it's okay, trust me I never wanna say anything about you, it's all gravy 
 I know you saw Memphis Bleek and Jay Z 
 Spitting on my tune it's a good look 
 Now the promoters know they should have booked the explicit 
 You can't say I'm not the best in it 
 That's like saying how my granny's not a good cook 
 I know Lethal B came with a good But it wouldn't be as big if it wasn't for the kick 
 Drum, face it, I made a big one 
 I've got nuff more beats, you can listen to my CD and pick one 
 If I don't like what you're saying I'll delete your phone call on a quick one - dead 
 You get me? Don't phone my phone 
 On some 8 bar relay tune 
 Done that, that's old news 
 Some new stuff now 
 Greatest Hits, the real shit, 2000 and everything, yeah 
 Skepta, Boy Better Know, shuuut 
 Yeah, Boy Better Know, go on!
