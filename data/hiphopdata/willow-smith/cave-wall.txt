Magic, vibrations like magic 
 Some of us can't handle it 
 But that don't mean we can't 
 So paint me in black 
 Oh, on your cave wall 
 I wanna know I have your respect 
 I wanna know I have undivided attention 
 We are stuck in the fake idea 
 We connect rifles and thought out wars 
 That's how we get power 
 It's all force 
 We all know, we all know 
 So paint me in ash 
 On your cave wall 
 I wanna know you realize your light 
 I wanna know you absorve your life 
 We all know, we all know
