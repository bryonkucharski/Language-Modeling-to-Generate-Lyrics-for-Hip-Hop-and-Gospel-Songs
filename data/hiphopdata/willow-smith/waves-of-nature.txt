I know you've been cutting ties, you've been telling lies 
 I know you don't know the time, it's all up in your mind 
 But I can't get with it, no 
 I can't get with it, no 
 Won't get a whiff of that sickness 
 You say you wanna fly, that's alright 
 Gotta buckle up, better hold on tight 
 Gotta get in your right side of mind 
 Get in your right side of mind 
 If you're tryna fly 
 Better hold on, hold on tight 
 Get in your right side of mind 
 Get in your right side of mind 
 If you're tryna fly 
 Human spend so much time tryna figure out life 
 Tryin' to classify wrong and right 
 Better hold on, hold on, tight 
 It's gonna be a bumpy ride, it's gonna be a bumpy ride 
 Full of lies and pastimes 
 Full of lights and endless nights 
 You don't feel your merkabah spin 
 Just try again and again, just try and again like 
 I try again and again 
 I try again and again 
 I try again and again 
 I try again and again 
 You say you wanna fly, that's alright 
 Gotta buckle up, better hold on tight 
 Gotta get in your right side of mind 
 Get in your right side of mind 
 If you're tryna fly 
 Better hold on, hold on tight 
 Get in your right side of mind 
 Get in your right side of mind 
 If you're tryna fly 
 Circles, circles, ellipses 
 Trees and flowers, breeze and grass and laughs 
 She's drawing 
 Circles, circles, ellipses 
 Trees and flowers, breeze and grass and laughs 
 Straight lines, he's running out of time 
 Trying to get from A to B, from he to she 
 Straight lines, he's running out of time 
 Trying to get from A to B to eternity 
 You say you wanna fly, that's alright 
 Gotta buckle up, better hold on tight 
 Gotta get in your right side of mind 
 Get in your right side of mind 
 If you're tryna fly 
 Better hold on, hold on tight 
 Get in your right side of mind 
 Get in your right side of mind 
 If you're tryna fly 
 Get in your right side 
 If you're tryna fly, tell me, tell me if you're tryna fly 
 To your right side of mind 
 To your right side of mind 
 To your right side of mind
