I can't live another life 
 Spend another time 
 I can't spit another rhyme on Gaia 
 Guns and wars won't stop the fights 
 Not inside your mind 
 Love and communion, there's nothing better 
 Cheeks get redder 
 There's nothing better 
 Even in rough weather 
 It's raining knives, like all the time 
 And I'm alive, Irayo Eywa, we're alive 
 Marceline, I'm coming to get you, girl 
 We're flying so high, catch a ride on Lady Unicorn 
 Marceline, I know you're not real in this dimension, I mean 
 What's up with your dad up in the nightosphere? 
 Your tears, they're cleansing all my spheres 
 You touch my hair, I'm playing on your bass 
 But we don't care, we're messing up your space 
 You got nowhere to live, but you'll go back to space 
 Huh... take me with you 
 I'm sick of mildew 
 I'm sick of all of these humans telling me what to do 
 They make you stupid, but we are from Nibiru 
 Remember your cosmic roots 
 Marceline, I'm coming to get you, girl 
 We're flying, lets catch a ride on Lady Unicorn 
 Marceline, Marceline 
 Marceline, you're breathing in gasoline
