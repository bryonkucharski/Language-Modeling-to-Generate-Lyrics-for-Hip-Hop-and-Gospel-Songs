Your body is like a blanket 
 That falls sweetly around me 
 Your love, I cannot take it 
 Sometimes I feel my heart's roping and I'm frowning 
 But I wanna know 
 Yes, I wanna know 
 Why is my mind so desperate? 
 Yes, I wanna know 
 Yes, I have to know 
 My heart don't get it 
 I need to know, I need to know 
 My mind is like a prison 
 Called "Circling Irony" 
 I travel in all directions 
 Only to find myself on the same place your standing 
 I wanna know, I have to know 
 How do I reverse this? 
 I wanna know, I need to know 
 How do a transcendence? 
 How do you? How? 
 How do you transcend? 
 How do you make friends? 
 (I need to know) 
 How? How do you? 
 How do you transcend? 
 (I need to know)
