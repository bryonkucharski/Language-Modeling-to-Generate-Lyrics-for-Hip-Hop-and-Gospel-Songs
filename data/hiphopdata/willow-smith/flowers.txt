You wished upon a star 
 Saw the mother snap back and now you're where you started 
 My heart aches when I see your face 
 That's the story of this life but my soul saw it twice 
 Never had a problem but my soul seems to fight through the artifice of life 
 But it's the flower 
 It's the flower 
 It's the flower 
 It's the flower 
 It's the flower 
 We were walking on clouds but greys came down and they wiped us all out 
 But it's the flower 
 It's the flower 
 It's the flower 
 It's the flower 
 It's the flower 
 We were walking on clouds but greys came down and they wiped us all out 
 But it's the flower 
 I wanna be an atlantean 
 Let's get the 10, let's get the 10 x 4 
 And we'll knock down the door, knock down the door 
 We'll see what they've been hiding 
 Let me tell you 'bout the story of Poseidon 
 He was a young boy who was enlightened, kinda like Jaden 
 Kinda like the way we, look in the sky and we see the chem trails 
 And we nearly all cried, and then they just die we merely just tried to help them 
 The government is tryna tryna sell them not help them 
 But, the indigos are here we remembered 
 Remembered how we can all shift the weather 
 Because, love is the air we breathe, the people we see 
 The realization that were all in unity 
 So you and me, and I and I 
 We're the flower 
 We're the flower 
 We're the flower 
 We're the flower 
 It's the flower 
 We were walking on clouds but the greys came down and they wiped us all out 
 But it's the flower 
 It's the flower 
 It's the flower 
 It's the flower 
 It's the flower 
 We were walking on clouds but greys came down and they wiped us all out 
 But it's the flower 
 Just go, just go 
 We were walking on clouds but greys came down and they wiped us all out 
 And we felt down, baby
