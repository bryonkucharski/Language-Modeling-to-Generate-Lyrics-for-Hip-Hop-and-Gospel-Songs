I'm just an itty bitty shard 
 Floating through the wind 
 I told her she could meet me at the park 
 But she never did 
 I cried and cried and waited to the dark 
 Behind the lunar glare 
 Twirling, swirling 
 Feeling so at home within her locks of hair 
 You, you 
 Tell me where you've been 
 Where you've been 
 I'm running around feeling crazy 
 But I know it's just because you called me "baby"
