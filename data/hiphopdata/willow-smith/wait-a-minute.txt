Wait a minute! 
 I think I left my conscience on your front door step 
 Wait a minute! 
 I think I left my consciousness in the 6th dimension 
 But I'm here right now, right now 
 Just sitting in a cloud, oh wow 
 I'm here right now, right now with you, oh wow, oh wow 
 I don't even care 
 Run my hands through your hair 
 You wanna run your fingers through mine 
 But my dreads too thick and that's all right 
 Hold on, wait a minute! 
 Feel my heart's intention 
 Hold on, wait a minute! 
 I left my consciousness in the 6th dimension 
 Left my soul in his vision 
 Let's go get it, oh, oh 
 Let's go get it, oh, oh 
 Some things don't work 
 Some things are bound to be 
 Some things, they hurt 
 And they tell the body 
 You left your diary at my house 
 And I read those pages, you really love me, baby 
 Some things don't work 
 Some things are bound to be 
 Some things, they hurt 
 And they tell the body 
 But I broke my word, and you were bound to see 
 And I cried at the curb 
 When you first said "Oel ngati kameie" 
 Hold on, wait a minute! 
 Feel my heart's intention 
 Hold on, wait a minute! 
 I left my consciousness in the 6th dimension 
 Left my soul in his vision 
 Let's go get it, oh, oh 
 Let's go get it, oh, oh 
 Some people lie to me 
 Some just tryin' to get by 
 Some people I can't hurt 
 Some just rather say goodbye, bye 
 Hold on, wait a minute! 
 Feel my heart's intention 
 Hold on, wait a minute! 
 I left my consciousness in the 6th dimension 
 Left my soul in his vision 
 Let's go get it, oh, oh 
 Let's go get it, oh, oh
