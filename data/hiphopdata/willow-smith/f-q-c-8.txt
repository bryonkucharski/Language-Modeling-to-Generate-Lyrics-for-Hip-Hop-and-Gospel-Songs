And they all fell 
 From the sky into my eye 
 I did not cry, I felt alive 
 And not so blind, anymore 
 Oh, I yelled out into the atmosphere 
 I hope you're here 
 Oh, they say how I was gone for a long time 
 But for me it was five minutes, aye 
 That's relativity for you 
 I could show off for you and you wouldn't even know, ah 
 No you wouldn't even know 
 It'd just be a subconscious plant in your mind 
 A subconscious plant in your mind's eye 
 I don't know why I cry, I lie, but I 
 Just feel my way through life 
 And try to be that shining light 
 For you and for me 
 Oh, we don't get an eternity oh 
 It's all an eternity 
 I don't know why I cry, I lie, but I 
 Just feel my way through life 
 Love runs out in a flash 
 I could never stick with it 
 But it always sticks with me 
 Love runs out in a flash 
 I could never stick with it 
 But it always sticks with me 
 We're gonna slow it down for you guys really quick 
 Grab your neighbor's hand, get comfortable 
 Om, om, om 
 Grab your neighbor's hand, get-get comfortable 
 C-c-c get comfortable 
 Om, om, om 
 Get-get, comfortable 
 Please grab your neighbor's hand, just dance 
 Om, om, om - ah
