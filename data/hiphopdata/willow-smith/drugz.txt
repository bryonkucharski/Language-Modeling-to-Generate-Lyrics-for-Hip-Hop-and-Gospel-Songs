I am just a little girl walking in the forest 
 You're smiling wide, it's not all right 
 I am just a little girl, but I stand mighty 
 I feel the sunrise on my side 
 But I see a tiny space in his eyes 
 It's very tucked away, it won't hide 
 I'm the heroin inside of the syringe 
 And I'm not going in 
 And I'm just a girl 
 Walking through the woods, but I'm mighty 
 I'ma climb this mountain 
 And ain't nobody gonna stop me 
 Not even you, not even you, oh, oh 
 Not even you, not even you, oh, oh 
 I know it is true, I know it is true 
 I am just a little girl walking in a forest 
 Got the crystals in the bag in my right hand 
 Vibration's rising so the molecule's porous 
 I can see straight through the trees with the touch of my hand 
 But I am just the molecules there inside 
 It's very far away, I won't hide 
 It's now a part of me, I'm not gonna cry 
 Not gonna cry, not gonna cry 
 I'm gonna climb, I'm gonna climb 
 In this tree, 'cause it's a fractal of me 
 Don't try to analyze the breeze 
 Akashic records in your teeth 
 That's why I'm surfing over reefs 
 That's why I'm sleeping under tepees 
 With my native culture 
 My hugs are warm and my words are colder 
 I am just a little girl walking through the forest 
 I am just a little girl walking through the forest 
 I am just a little girl walking through the forest 
 I am just a little girl 
 I'm sitting in the world
