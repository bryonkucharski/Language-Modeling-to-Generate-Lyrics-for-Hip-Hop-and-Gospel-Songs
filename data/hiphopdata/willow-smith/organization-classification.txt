Classification and organization is ruining the minds of our generation 
 I said it 
 That's why they're always staying up in the sky 
 They add a new design to it 
 But they're on their phone and I'm on a roll 
 And I do not care 'cause I am the oldest one 
 Up in my mind, but not in real time 
 I'm just a... teenager 
 But I feel angrier than a swarm of hornets 
 They call us whores but it's just because 
 We do what we want and don't look back once 
 Is that what it's come to? No, no 
 My parents are 1 and 2, and I am their child 
 I am 3, I am the wild 
 I am free 
 We are the children that sing the ancient song 
 And we can sing it very well 
 But there's still so much to learn 
 There's still so much to earn 
 But I yearn 
 Who am I scared 
 Who cut us open 
 Classification and organization is ruining the hearts of our generation 
 I said it 
 But actually, True told me that 
 True made the map 
 True took us to the forest to the top of the mountain 
 It's true, it's true, it's true 
 He told me to get on the mic and spit what's in my lung 
 I tried to say, I tried to tell him 
 "Boy, I don't do that, I don't do the things that you do" 
 But then he looked at me and said, "You do, you do" 
 [?] Face too, went into my room at night 
 They tried to talk about who 
 And I'm like, "Let me sleep" 
 But they just wake me up 
 They just try to tell me the things I know already 
 In my cerebral capacity 
 But it's locked, why can't I get in? 
 Maybe I should ask Finn, maybe I should ask Jake 
 Maybe we go to a lake that I found 
 Maybe we go right now 
 And it's snowing but it's warm outside 
 Write a letter on the beach at night 
 Go to bed and then I see those lights 
 I see those lights, I see their eyes 
 Staring back at me, telling me about the symmetry 
 Telling me about atomic structure 
 The way she loves her, the way 
 The ocean rolls around and 'round and 'round 
 And 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round 
 And the tourist goes around and down 
 And down and down and down and down, it never stops 
 Never rock 
 I call it crystal, now you call it rock 
 I'm in the spot 
 You don't want to walk around on the hot coals of self acceptance 
 Man I get you, MSFTS here to rep yah 
 We'll do this together 
 Organization and classification is ruining the souls of our generation 
 We said it 
 And the kids know very well 
 And the kids will dig the well 
 Deep inside of their third eye and get all the messages inside
