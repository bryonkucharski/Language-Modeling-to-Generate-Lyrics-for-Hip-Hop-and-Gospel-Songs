Oe Ngati Kameie 
 Inside your mind I converse with your star self 
 And tell me why I'm here right now 
 Hidden in a cloud, I'm hydrogen atoms 
 Split me up and mess up your planet 
 Mess up your planet 
 Just like the Greys 
 Just like the Martians 
 Just like a garden 
 Just like I remember 
 Star kids and now I'm sitting here 
 Now I'm passing a light year 
 Inside my sphere, yes in my planet 
 Inside my heart, I will just plant it 
 The seed of knowledge 
 I said I got this 
 I don't think it's fair that you're on Earth 
 And I'm up up here 
 Making stars and galaxies and comets 
 Making a life on other dimensions 
 I don't think it's fair that you're on Earth 
 And I'm up here 
 Making stars and galaxies and planets 
 Making a life on other dimension
