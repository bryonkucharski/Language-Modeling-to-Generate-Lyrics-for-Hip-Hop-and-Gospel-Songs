My temple 
 My temple 
 I wanna hear your heart beat 
 The steady humming your merkaba spin 
 Everything, even thoughts about me 
 When I wake up in the morning time 
 I think about my past life 
 Was I with you or you with me? 
 We're living in a fantasy, babe it's all a dream 
 It's kinda hard to see 
 You need the heart to see 
 You need the heart to see, oh see 
 What's going down in your town? I 
 I'm riding 'round in the night 
 My body is moving, I'm tryna get grooving, yeah 
 What's going down in your head? I 
 I'm riding 'round in the night 
 I'm tryna get grooving, let's go to the beach and jump in 
 Oh they trusted her and she tried to be 
 Everything that they want her to 
 But she had to see what she could do 
 And all the things that she would also 
 Tell me one thing 
 Is it really bad to have experience? 
 Then you know for yourself 
 Rather than sit home and believe in this 
 They said, "Willow don't touch that" 
 I looked and walked and then I went and touched it 
 They said, "Don't walk fast" 
 I took off running and was not near stopping 
 What's going down in your town? I 
 I'm riding 'round in the night 
 My body is moving, I'm tryna get groving, yeah 
 What's going down in your town? I 
 I'm riding 'round 
 I'm gonna go, baby, the frequency 
 You wanna roll with me 
 Broken 
 Two shards that fit together 
 Hoping 
 More come together 
 To make a piece of art 
 Bigger than anything we could imagine 
 To make a piece of art 
 That's raising the whole vibration of gaia 
 Going right back to the ropes 
 What's going down in your town? I 
 I'm riding 'round in the night 
 My body is moving, I'm tryna get grooving, yeah
