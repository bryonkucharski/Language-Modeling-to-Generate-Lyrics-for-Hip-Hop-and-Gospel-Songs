I think I'm coming undone 
 I think I'm getting started 
 Us humans we don't know one thing 
 About ourself or anything 
 And I for one know nothing 
 But you can tell me something 
 You can whisper something 
 You think I'm coming undone 
 You think I'm going crazy 
 Us humans we don't know one thing 
 About ourself or anything 
 And he for one knows everything 
 And she won't tell you nothing 
 She just sits their cuffing, no 
 Let's think about how we created this, oh 
 Let's think about how we let this happen, oh-oh-oh 
 We want our freedoms without responsibility 
 And we are so scared to see 
 Oh, we're not so different 
 We're not so different 
 Oh, we're not so different 
 We're not so different 
 Oh, we're not so different 
 We're not so different 
 Oh, we're not so different 
 We're not so different 
 We can run through the sun and forget this place 
 Fickle heart, fickle mind, you robbed me blind 
 You want to run, so let's run 
 You can run but you can't hide 
 My fickle mind, it's going blind 
 So you run to your roots 
 So you run to your roots 
 So you run to your roots 
 (We're not so different, not so different, not so different, oh) 
 Oh, we're not so different 
 We're not so different 
 Oh, we're not so different 
 We're not so different 
 (We're not so different, not so different, not so different, oh) 
 Oh, we're not so different 
 We're not so different 
 Oh, we're not so different 
 We're not so different 
 I'm independent, I stay on the beach, I roll with the seas 
 I'm not an investment, you have no control over me 
 Maybe I could say one thing, maybe 
 Maybe I could pretend like money grows on trees 
 But it does and that's the funny thing 
 The ironic thing, uh, the kind of scary thing 
 It all destroys for me, ah 
 (We're not so different, not so different, not so different, oh) 
 Oh, we're not so different 
 We're not so different 
 Oh, we're not so different 
 We're not so different 
 (We're not so different, not so different, not so different, oh) 
 Oh, we're not so different 
 We're not so different 
 Oh, we're not so different 
 We're not so different
