Breathing's easier under water 
 I can see sky from here 
 Please remember, all you've taught her 
 I can see God from here 
 If only I could stay, If only I could stay for you 
 I would try 
 If only I could wait, If only I could wait for you 
 I would fly 
 If only I could stay, If only I could pray 
 If only I could wait, If only you could stay 
 Up, up in your zone, Yes, you're all alone 
 Yes I'm all alone 
 Not negative, just different 
 You wanna have lunch, and I wanna have a picnic 
 You wanna go up, I wanna just fly all night 
 Cause baby you 
 Got me tired of this, love thing its tough 'cause I, want to love you but you, keep being so afraid, afraid 
 If only I could stay, if only you could stay 
 Up, up in your zone, Yes you're all alone, Yes I'm all alone 
 Getting in the car, we cruisin', going down the PCH, I'm going to get a smoothie 
 Never had a problem, but I know that you gon' do this, cause you the smoothest 
 Blue is the emotion, that I'm feeling 
 Apologies an option, let me hear it 
 What took you so long to finish your storm son? 
 Not negative, Just different 
 You wanna go out, I wanna finish living 
 You wanna get up, when I could just lay all day, with you 
 When I could just stay all day, with you 
 Hey baby, you're sack of potatoes, we could grow eyes for later 
 Moments to savor 
 We made, we made, we made art, art 
 I can't stop, stop, you've blown away, away, away 
 I don't play wanna no more, I'm not a kid no more 
 I've did some things, that you can see, that I've been gone away 
 That I have room to be whom I want to be, and you don't even talk to me 
 It's three, It's three, It's me, It's Moi, It's Jay, It's all these days 
 My days are numbered, you can come through
