Oh, oh 
 Oh, oh, ah 
 Oh, oh 
 I guess they don't like me 
 But I never figured out why 
 I never tried to figure out why 
 I guess they think I don't like them either 
 Don't like them at all 
 That's how life goes 
 That's how life goes 
 But I don't want to hold it back 
 I just need to learn how to let go 
 I don't know 
 I will never know 
 We'll never know but that's the greatest part 
 And I won't stop, I won't stop 
 I'mma ride this wave 
 Right to the shore of my grave 
 When I say goodbye to Earth 
 When I say goodbye to Earth 
 When I say goodbye to the third dimension 
 When I say goodbye to all this, amnesia 
 I do not want to tell you what I know 
 But I do not know much 
 I don't ever want to put on a show 
 But I do it all so much 
 When I rock with you, when I roll with you 
 Let's go to the beach, maybe climb some trees 
 We'll jump in some lakes, or maybe... swing on vines 
 And praise to father sun's light, oh 
 See I could care less what you do 
 I could care less where that negativity is as I'm trying to float 
 Where that stuff come reach us 
 But I don't want to hold it back 
 I just want to learn how to let go 
 I don't know 
 I will never know 
 We'll never know but that's the greatest part 
 And I won't stop, I won't stop 
 I'mma ride this wave 
 Right to the shore of my grave 
 When I say goodbye to Earth 
 When I say goodbye to Earth 
 When I say goodbye to the third dimension 
 When I say goodbye to all this, amnesia 
 I do not want to tell you what I know 
 But I do not know much 
 I don't ever want to put on a show 
 But I do it all so much 
 I do not want to tell you what I know 
 But I do not know much 
 I don't ever want to put on a show 
 But I do it all so much 
 I do not know, I do not know, I do not know 
 I do not know, I do not know, I do not know 
 I do not know, I do not know, I do not know 
 I do not know, I do not know, I do not know 
 But I don't want to hold it back 
 I just want to learn what I don't know
