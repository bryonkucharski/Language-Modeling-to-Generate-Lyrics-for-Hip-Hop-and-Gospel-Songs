Black heaven is a place where people like me go 
 Up there in black heaven, black heaven 
 Know Dr. King still preachin' about togetherness 
 But probably lookin' down sayin' it's irrelevant 
 Whitney Houston, she was heaven sent 
 A song bird prolly smilin' right now listenin' to her own words 
 Rosa Parks so much heart, she an OG 
 Know she smilin' lookin' at the blacks in the front seat 
 Bernie Mac jokin' right now, him and Richard Pryor 
 Trayvon prolly lookin' down sayin' them niggas wild 
 I know who givin' knowledge up there, 2Pac 
 He lookin' down like what happened to this hip hop? 
 Biggie Smalls prolly swagged out, laid back 
 Him and Eazy talkin' bout how it was way back 
 Nate Dogg prolly reminicin' about the A-Trak 
 Pimp sayin' prayers that Bun and Jay stay strapped 
 Michael Jackson? He prolly maxin' and relaxin' 
 Him and Marvin Gaye makin' a classic 
 I know you smilin' down up there in black heaven 
 I know you're really proud of me up there in black heaven 
 I know you smilin' down on me in black heaven 
 Thinkin' of you till the day we meet again 
 Billie Holiday thinkin' about the old days 
 Johnny Taylor makin' mixes with the Ojays 
 Rodney King prolly thinkin' bout his old ways 
 Thinkin' bout how they burned the city down bout his old case 
 Malcolm X prolly wishin' he was down here 
 To take our hoods back from the people who ain't from round here 
 James Brown still hollin' it's a man's world 
 But thinkin' damn all these girls takin' man's girl 
 Know Jackie Neal talkin' bout how people roll 
 Know Tooki Williams still stickin' to the G code 
 Wilt probably still saying nobody broke his record 
 Mac Dre still represent as a bay legend 
 Know I and Bleek prolly talkin' 'bout me 
 Them niggas prolly jam with Big Stone, out the three 
 DJ Screw lookin' down at the culture that he started 
 Rest in peace Bob Marley 
 I know you smilin' down up there in black heaven 
 I know you're really proud of me up there in black heaven 
 I know you smilin' down on me in black heaven 
 Thinkin' of you till the day we meet again 
 Where do my niggas go to when they pass? 
 And why do good niggas never last? 
 Some get addicted to the fast route 
 The hand in hand, you know that cash route 
 I pray to God that we see better days 
 I caught a record while the record plays 
 I'm thinkin' Lord don't let 'em carry me 
 See I know one day when they bury me 
 I'll go straight to black heaven, black heaven 
 Yeah I go straight to black heaven, black heaven 
 Don't let the paranoia get to me 
 Can't take a trip to penitentiary 
 I make a flip and take the summer off 
 A half a brick? Now that's a summer salt 
 I look to God, it's been along road 
 I got my braid up, like a cornrow 
 I've been through hell, one day I'll find my way 
 If not then maybe I can buy my way to black heaven
