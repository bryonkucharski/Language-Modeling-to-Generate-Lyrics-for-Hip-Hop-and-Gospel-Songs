Mo' murder, mo' murder 
 A body fulla tack 2's, battlescars from bullet wounds 
 New clothes, diamond medallions from paid dues 
 Niggas that ride till they rue with the attitude of 
 'Fuck the world' from tryin' to kill us every time we move 
 You're perpetratin to be a killer but I know you're fakers 
 Them jealous cowards killed my nigga 2PAC in Vegas 
 Vague kind of bullets fired, we're ready to die with open eyes 
 I be the last man standin when the smoke dies 
 This world's infested with haters, wannabe players 
 Player hatin' a real player 'cause he's livin' major 
 No disrespect to you redneck blood-suckin pigs 
 If a nigga die, just give my cash to my wife and kids 
 But what you thought makes the world go round 
 I got an ese in the East Bay ballin a hundred pounds 
 Push a 600 rag drop E-12 
 Dump a 100-round clip in ya, ask about my mail 
 I try to keep my focus, on survivin and money 
 Can't let them niggas smoke us, before we unload them talons 
 Traumatise and hope this is how we leave 'em when they hit us 
 With the guts to die, pullin the trigger till my casket drops 
 Them player haters wanna blast me up like they did 'Pac 
 But I don't give a fuck I'm a ride till my casket drop 
 It don't stop until you sucker niggas drippin jelly 
 Pumpin slugs into you motherfuckin pig's belly 
 I'm full of indica weed laced with heroin 
 Call it Kryptonite-on the dead, I'ma risk tonight 
 Blast the first motherfucker that steps 
 Up to my ride, not knowin' where my weapon is kept 
 I shoot in-side their chests, I'ma thug life, I'm crazy 
 Got my strength rays to make him kiss his babies 
 Fuckin' sucker ass niggas that didn't ??? ??? 
 Hard lies on him and didn't retaliate 
 Hard then later on "Shit, hey what's happenin'?" 
 We woulda chased them suckers down and capped em 
 Give a shout to Outlaw Immortalz right 
 Look me up 'cause I'm a ride until my casket drops 
 Murder, money, power, pistols and warfare 
 Kill all my black folks and the peckerwoods wouldn't care 
 Keep my head up, duckin and dodgin from the state pen 
 'Cause fo' sho', ain't no future in goin' back again 
 They got to kill me, fill me up with lead 
 Let me, die slowly from my boots to my head 
 As a, big chief I refuse to retreat, I 
 Rip teeth outta eye then dump heat, why 
 The PD reach but catch concrete 
 Never sol-ved, gone off indica and Hennessey 
 Infrared at my dog, paws locked like pig jaws 
 With my gun up, punk, I run up on alla y'all 
 Then I dump, dump dump dump to get the money 
 Now I stole Rolex diamond, shinin outta sunny 
 West Coast the spot, servin' caine to get the millions 
 Distributin the game, makes you want to get the billions
