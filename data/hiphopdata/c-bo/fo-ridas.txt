Uh 
 This one's fo the money 
 Uh 
 We ridin' raw '97 Suburban's wit the chrome kit 
 Every nigga on trigga ready to dome split 
 Got a million 
 But still ain't satisfied 
 Gold thangs on every old school that we ride 
 Got keys 
 So many g's 
 Bitches on they knees, dyin' to get wit these 
 If a bitch ain't about her money, man I can't fuck wit that 
 Got to be down to run the street, sellin that pussy or move some yak 
 Ask yo folks bitch like 40 I'm so serious about my scratch 
 Livin' like a straight hustla b pass the weed, man fuck a batch 
 From Vallejo to Sac 
 Pushin new Lacs an '96 Ac's 
 We roll strapped, lounge wit the money from the game of crack 
 Some million dolla macks gettin' taxed for the crack sack 
 From 'ol skool seven-deuce Chevy's an glass packs 
 Representin to the fullest, the west-side of the map 
 Where we roll strapped wit black ridas stuck in the mack 
 Ridas. 
 (Chrous: C-Bo) 
 I was born in hell juss to be a rida 
 Wit lo-lo's an 4-4's an mo hoes fo the ridas 
 Keep my pants saggin stay strapped wit the magnum ridas 
 Desperado outlaws do the dirt 
 I got bitches like the mack, out to get my scratch 
 Pushin the '9-7 Lac, movin keys of yak 
 An ain't a damn thang changed about the dope game 
 But the bitches size the money an the price of the caine 
 From ruby 13-5's is how we get it 
 Cracked out, the metro packs saran wrapped an get it 
 If it's money then a nigga, gots to get it 
 Hit it an quit it, but I ain't wit it less it's worth a mill ticket 
 I'm a savage 
 About my cabbage 
 I gots to have it 
 Automatic, movin through traffic prepared fo static 
 Got a sack that weighs a ton, wit a mac-11 one, uh 
 Jackas when they come, get done-ditty-done, trick 
 Mutha fuckaz can't hang wit the Garden Blocc gang 
 Packin tech's, quick to wreck brains 
 I'm insane, like the loccest mutha fucka on caine 
 To kill first like a rida, is the rules of the game 
 Rida. 
 Diamond rings, an chains down wit the Rolex name 
 Ridin' Lexus's in Texas I where my pits get trained 
 Mo pain 
 Then I proceed to gain 
 Like a gumbo pot full 'o sell 'em up full of caine 
 Got a 4-5 got a Stang I'm Major Pain inflictin pain 
 No pain, no gain 
 Was out fo murda when I came 
 Don't tame mo niggaz, then a million man march 
 An hang those niggaz, blessed wit a weak heart 
 No marks in my game, then bump an pull triggaz 
 Mash off an ridas leavin' nothin' but dead niggaz 
 I'm real wit this, that's why they kill wit this 
 Young ballaz on alcohol, that'll peel yo shit 
 Don't try to act like you hardcore 
 Knowin' you ain't 
 Mafia's ready fo war bringin' the yellow tank 
 Westcoast is the spot where I slang my yey 
 Distributin it nation wide, all across the state 
 Fo ridas.
