 (Marvaless) 
 Yeah, ladies first so watch me set it off, even the brothers can't touch us 
 Professional Ballers is what they call us, ain't no tellin' who we're bailin 
 Kentucky, Texas, ATL strikin in a Lexus 
 The nigga that wanna test this 
 Thought this shit was shut down, thought this shit was dead like Makaveli 
 Cali legends keep it goin', bout this player shit I'm knowin' 
 Haters, I know you're bumpin this shit so here's another *?daltz?* 
 From the Bay to the SCC, you heard us straight from California's most 
 (Pizzo) 
 We don't need no practice, no theatrics 
 'Bout the way we be livin' with the Mafia tactics, I be constantly at it 
 Tryin' to stack my riches like Bill Gates 
 Servin' raw and uncut caine so you can't hate 
 Because it angers me when niggas try to bite my ass 
 But we be Professional Ballers hittin at the top-notch ass 
 Pass the green leaf on the left, inhale a breath of chronic smoke 
 Exhale like a pro, I be too much for you to cope 
 (Chorus: C-Bo) 
 We steady countin' our money, on a mission to ball 
 All the things we dream we wanna see before we call 
 So we pack heavy, push Chevy's, makin' the 'fetti 
 If you're ready to holler at a Professional Baller 
 (Mac Mall) 
 Baby Capone on the loose, skywalk and fly shit 
 Off Paraguay, Glock in the drop plus we're hidin 
 Astronauts, turnin' in shit for the soldiers that recop 
 Shoot outta state pushin killer Cali rocks 
 Big wreckin ball nuts and you can notify the monks 
 I be flossin in gators, maybe ??? ??? 
 Tennis shoes, press our shit 
 Aliens gank and flew, runnin' out to see you 
 With the loot 
 (Interlude: Killa Tay) 
 Yeah 
 West Coast Mafia, bitch 
 Everybody else can suck a dick 
 (Killa Tay) 
 I'm steadily tryin' to get my bail on 
 Tapped me up on the cell phone, it ain't far 
 Stomped in steel toes, I look out my ??? so back up off me 
 The K-I-double L-A T-A-Y, call me the locster 
 Only smokes the bombest chronic, Professional Ballers like the Sonics 
 Respect game, with or without these gold chains 
 We're sure the West got shit sold 
 From the rap game to the cocaine, come get some 
 Got pounds like a kick drum, got hitmen 
 Payin' 'em under the table, lyrics fatal like a ninja 
 No pretendin, we're steady ballin 
 (C-Bo) 
 From the Valley to the Bay, I'm known for stackin chips 
 My 500 whip be hip with the AMG hit 
 '74 drop Caprice, gold ones dip 
 Candy-coated sport, Professional Ballers don't trip 
 Makin' moves, pushin luxuries to ol' schools 
 I spit the A-1, that's why my pockets weigh a tonne 
 And my crew be Mafioso's, high performance and low-lows 
 Professional Ballers on the go and get more doe 
 (JT Tha Bigga Figga) 
 Who keep it knockin' with mean choppers? My niggas keep it poppin' 
 We're rockin', Professional Ballers, Figga-Ro will be the tallest 
 Player that you spot, duck or dodge? 
 It's all, turn the Impalas all skirty 
 Left 'em deserted, heat 'em where their pockets hurted 
 Sold it up by then, two quarters and half a flynn 
 With my nigga Bo-Loc in the 500 Benz 
 Ready to bust and make it happen fo' sho', so stack G's 
 With them 8-ball gangstas 
 And the young mack knees and that's for sheez
