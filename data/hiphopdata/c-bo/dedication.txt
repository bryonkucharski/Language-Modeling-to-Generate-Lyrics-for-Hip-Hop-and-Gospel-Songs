With my eyes open I tried to focus 
 I see my mother 
 Squeezing my hand teary eyed behind her 
 I see my brothers 
 And I wonder, how quick the game would take me under 
 I felt the bullets hit me in the back and it felt like thunder 
 Man, I'm thinkin' is it too late for me to change? 
 I knew this world is full of snakes dog but that's a part of the game 
 A young thug that always scream I ain't afraid of rain 
 I would just fight it out with Lord when I had no one to blame 
 From all the dirt I did 
 Snatchin purses to pay the rent 
 I knew it would all catch up to me 
 Man I hope I'm heaven sent 
 I used to be the main one screamin nigga I'm prepared to die 
 And when it came down to me layin' on the death bin I was scared to die 
 No evidence of a killa when I found a bird in my dresser 
 And if I don't die here 
 I'll die tracin your hot desert 
 I can't win for losin to meet a whole gang of snakes 
 Never thought about killin' myself 
 But I refuse to die at the stake 
 Nigga, have you ever been sittin' in your car nigga, rollin' up a blunt? 
 When a nigga comes up to your window and gives you a whole clip? 
 Nah you ain't ever had that, you ain't ever experienced that 
 Have you ever been walkin' through the park 
 With your kids and your family, and a nigga comes out the bushes and 
 Gives you and your family a whole clip? 
 No you ain't ever had that 
 I remember when I had it made 
 13 with a whole verb 
 Used to catch me comin' down the street clownin in my convertible Ford ?? 
 I used to be all on the curb 
 Tryin' to holla at me a shorty 
 With my right hand do dub 
 And me sippin up on a 40 
 Me and my nigga used to have it made 
 We used to even fuck the same bitches 
 We used to spend weeks and even months on the corner tryin' to maintain 
 Our riches 
 Remember we used to cut and go to other schools 
 And I slayed them niggas with lyrics 
 Had the whole school late for class 
 'Cause they all wanted to stay to hear it 
 I want to thank you my nig 
 'Cause every time I'm at war 
 You was always on my side 
 Remember that time you almost died nigga 
 And I saved your life 
 Yeah my dog that ain't shit 
 Nigga I'd do that a 1000 times 
 Remember back when we was kids 
 And I had like 1000 rhymes 
 I ain't forgot we unloaded the desert eagles 
 Nigga to save my brothers 
 The other niggas started the war 
 Then they snitched 
 When they asked who I smothered 
 To my niggas sittin' in a cell 
 Doin' 34 with an L 
 They can't separate us by jail 
 We all stuck in the same hell 
 I love you dawg 
 I'm in my room 
 Tryin' to make ends meet 
 Got on the phone 
 Have my whole crew 
 Meet me at the end of my street 
 I ain't wit havin' no weed to smoke 
 No drink, and bein broke 
 Nigga we got to hit the bank loc 
 And that's real ain't no joke 
 Take me over to the projects 
 So I can steal me a regal 
 Then we gonna run over to big Pooks house 
 So I can pick up those Desert Eagles 
 Y'all fools ready for this 
 It's on and crackin' at noon 
 We gonna get in and get out quick 
 With all the money we can consume 
 We hit 'em right 
 We hit 'em hard 
 And I got addicted 
 This shit is like a monkey on my back 
 And I can't kick it 
 So I'm robbin banks left and right 
 Everything is goin' good 
 Till I hooked up with this one nigga 
 From the other side of the hood 
 He was a hothead 
 He'd come in the banks shootin guards and shit 
 When we got out the bank and split the money 
 Them other niggas he would rob and shit 
 When the feds came sniffin around 
 That's when I knew he was a bitch 
 When the feds hit my house and put me on the ground 
 That's when I knew he was a snitch
