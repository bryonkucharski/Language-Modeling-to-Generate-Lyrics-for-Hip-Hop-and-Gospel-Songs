Gotta get my money! 
 Gotta get my money! 
 Gotta get it! 
 Diamonds an clothes (diamonds an clothes) 
 Money an hoes (money an hoes) 
 Make lotta doe (make lotta doe) 
 For them thugs an Kavieal's 
 Mobbin' a Range (mobbin' a Range) 
 Stackin' my change (stackin' my change) 
 'Cause it ain't no thang ('cause it ain't no thang) 
 Gettin' it to me's how we play 
 We hit the spot on a Sunday afternoon 
 It's hella hot the homies sellin' rocks 
 Actin' a fool 
 Aight, cool 
 You know the rules 
 Linen an jewels 
 But you can catch me in a Lex side lined by the pool 
 The Mobb kind wit' no care for the vice 
 My crew was trife 
 Stay influenced for a selectable price 
 The Mobb Life 
 The lime light 
 We balla tight 
 Mercedes an pretty ladies to fill a room full of spikes 
 You bitches hate it 'cause we finally made it 
 First it was famous now it's the world that we out there takin' 
 No longer chasin' 
 Kamakazi to the world yellin' 
 "You cowards jealous!" 
 An wonder why that we all felons 
 I do it better 
 Crack your cerebellum 
 I push a kick to watch my stack develop 
 You playa' hatas got me born to swell up 
 On a mission dodgin' clips 
 An the Mobb representin' 
 It's Kaviealstar's 
 Handle Bar wishes, uh 
 Diamonds an clothes (diamonds an clothes) 
 Money an hoes (money an hoes) 
 Make lotta doe (make lotta doe) 
 For them thugs an Kavieal's 
 Mobbin' a Range (mobbin' a Range) 
 Stackin' my change (stackin' my change) 
 'Cause it ain't no thang ('cause it ain't no thang) 
 Gettin' it to me's how we play 
 We get the money 
 Mo' money 
 That's how it came 
 Rolex, chains an thangs 
 My mission's to only gain 
 When Otis and Shug sang we get them major change 
 Two live playas on they way to do major thangs 
 Not juss to floss 
 We be the boss 
 Like Kingpin's 
 Me an BA in a rag Ferrari swingin' 
 Wit' the connection like the westside! 
 On the best side 
 We do it, gotta get the money right 
 An keep it crackin' like Kastro hoes say 
 Money over tricks buy the tons wit' no play 
 House party poppin' at the Malibu estates 
 Diamond jew-els 
 Big bodies an sails an Navigate's 
 We get them light skinned 
 Dark skinned 
 Short an tall 
 We like them baseball playas you know we knocks 'em all 
 Catch me at home plate, butt naked in my drawls 
 Grand slams an home runs they never find the ball 
 We Kavial's! 
 Diamonds an clothes (diamonds an clothes) 
 Money an hoes (money an hoes) 
 Make lotta doe (make lotta doe) 
 For them thugs an Kavieal's 
 Mobbin' a Range (mobbin' a Range) 
 Stackin' my change (stackin' my change) 
 'Cause it ain't no thang ('cause it ain't no thang) 
 Gettin' it to me's how we play 
 Steppin' wit' my weapon concentratin' on seven 
 Got both of my knees dirty 
 Gamblin' 
 Two grand on eleven 
 My nigga hit 
 Yellin' out this shit 
 Shake 'em up better 
 But I'm jus' scramblin' 
 Handlin' 
 My portion of chedda' 
 We good fellas 
 Hood fellas 
 Pop the Crist an hop in the six-hundred 
 'Cause ain't question where that bitch runnin' 
 I hit 'em an quit 'em 
 Stick 'em an lick 'em 
 But if it's worse enough I bet she pullin' my linen 
 My head spinnin' 
 Legs bendin' 
 It's all splended 
 We all grinnin' 
 'Cause havin' a ball 'cause we all chillin' 
 Jus' feel the realest 
 Don't need to mention 
 We jus' kickin' an stick up enough doe to make a livin', livin' 
 Diamonds an clothes (diamonds an clothes) 
 Money an hoes (money an hoes) 
 Make lotta doe (make lotta doe) 
 For them thugs an Kavieal's 
 Mobbin' a Range (mobbin' a Range) 
 Stackin' my change (stackin' my change) 
 'Cause it ain't no thang ('cause it ain't no thang) 
 Gettin' it to me's how we play 
 Diamonds an clothes (diamonds an clothes) 
 Money an hoes (money an hoes) 
 Make lotta doe (make lotta doe) 
 For them thugs an Kavieal's 
 Mobbin' a Range (mobbin' a Range) 
 Stackin' my change (stackin' my change)
