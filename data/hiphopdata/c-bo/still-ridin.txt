(Feat. Captain Save'm) 
 Still Ridin' 
 For my Nigga 2pac 
 Aka Makaveli 
 I won't deny it 
 I'm still Ridin' 
 For My Nigga Makeveli 
 Got all my niggas with me 
 Straight West Coast mutherfuckin' G's 
 (C-Bo) 
 I rock the rolo back ended down 
 I broke it low, you wet it down 
 When I rip up in a bulletproof 600 
 Niggas I just have to turn it down 
 I came for the chips 
 Don't worry I'll rain with a hollow tip 
 I drop the game with the kicks 
 And run the soul train line on you bitch 
 I got the 
 Game with this I make the 56th sense 
 And trick 
 It's gon' take more than a motherfucker playing up with this 
 And if you ain't buying you dying 
 Hollow tips flying make you deceased 
 I'll ride on you bitch ass niggas who won't let Makeveli Rest In Peace [echo] 
 (C-Bo) 
 When a guy gets dug deep 
 Gon' scrub that ass like Rub deep 
 Gets no love for me, so I took your 100G's but was scared to plug me 
 You've been bitin since Wetcoast Bad Boys 
 Now you're bitin Makeveli 
 With his name and game, you get the fame and chain 
 Tell me what's next 
 It seems funny not even Cash Money fuck wit you dummy's 
 Came out the closet like Mummy's 
 Bitin' everything in sight, still you're hungry 
 They say you boys let Pac live 
 Soon as it drop you copy his spirit 
 Feel the rippled in the water nigga 
 That's more than 5 a note 
 That's what I'm ridin' for! 
 (Captain Save'm) 
 I don't know what the fuck y'all thought 
 Or the fuck y'all was thinkin' 
 I just got my cap red and blue 
 Didn't know which way I was bangin' 
 It's Captian Save'm ho nigga 
 Think about it 
 I've been fuckin' with Master P 'fore he was 'bout it 'bout it 
 You ol crickle ass niggas 
 I won't let it 
 I know you got your foot in the door motherfucker, but I'm gon' shut it 
 Talkin' 'bout you's the shit 
 How you some big ol' figure 
 I've been fuckin' with E-40 
 Before he was federal nigga 
 Got Major ho's (Major) 
 Major Loot (Major) 
 I know you spent 200G's on your video 
 But you still ain't recouped 
 Mad at me 'cause I'm out here doin' my thug things see 
 I told you if you gon' be a baller it ain't gon' be easy 
 Learn the game before you get disrespect again 
 I'm talkin' to that East Coast ass nigga Memphis Bleek (motherfucker) 
 Already stolen grounds, on the radio station talkin' shit slidin' 
 I'm gon' do it for my nigga Charlie Hustle 'cause I'm West Side Ridin'!
