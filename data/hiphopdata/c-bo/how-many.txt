(C-Bo) 
 My whole crew balling 
 Pushing roses down to the impalas 
 On a mission for dollars bumping hoes 
 You know my motto 
 All about the cash 6 million dollar pad 
 That's money over hoes with big tits and ass 
 I like to lounge on my yacht 
 And count money by the blocks 
 Million dollars in crates 
 Invested birdes don't flock 
 So fuck some m*et dp and cristal 
 Pass some xo and hennessey and long ale 
 We push some rolls royces 
 Drop polices and porches you think I booshit 
 Big body benz's and expeditions 
 Pit boo sitting 
 Out front of the mini mansion 
 It's some westcoast hills looking over the whole planet 
 Coube doors marble floors 
 Inside our door pools on a move 
 Get more money than all you fools 
 Than independent then split it 
 Got in the cast and I jet 
 Straight out west nigga it's stacking in my nest 
 How many muthafuckas really down to ride with me 
 How many muthafuckas down to take a life for me 
 How many of you muthafuckas niggas down to die with me 
 Slide with me and pull a homicide with me 
 (C-Bo) 
 Growing up really never had much 
 Except my folks try to fucking get touch 
 We pulled licks and such to live plush 
 Rush out with it yeah we get it rob niggas mob niggas 
 Slide triggers to the right and left 
 Ride biggas in the west to def 
 Represent the westcoast nigga best to bring along a vest coat 
 The most dangerous like venim 
 We run up in them and see them them'em and send them off 
 To pay the 'cause they what 
 While we stashing the turkys like sasquash 
 Call the neighborhood watch 
 The feds couldn't knock us down or not 
 Pouring shots like scotch on the rocks 
 Busting armies like ahead looking cotch 
 40 cals gone blaow with smile 
 How the fuck you like us now 
 Wonder how we major 
 Been this way since teenagers 
 Sky pagers and punchy you know the rollers 
 Sack of crackola in boulders sitting in the trunk of the nova 
 How many muthafuckas really down to ride with me 
 How many muthafuckas down to take a life for me 
 How many of you muthafuckas niggas down to die with me 
 Slide with me and pull a homicide with me 
 (C-Bo) 
 I counted the counter like one two three 
 Fo shots to hit me could believe lil reeky got touched 
 Now what's the fuss 
 The whole city went bust ready to rip shit up 
 I'm in the cut zipping shackles while hillas getting nasty 
 I'm the suspect what the fuck is that 
 Loading the techs that I stepped on 
 See the muthafuckas the crept on 
 The dogs fly higher than the birds man smoking marycaine 
 'Cause it's cool to calm my nerves man 
 We got the word on the ride now bitches be 
 No one's liable for the actions that about to take place 
 All I know is when they comes for me I'm aiming for the face 
 Chase me down 
 Trying to speak you fucked with the wrong G 
 Crept to the b side on you quick to ride on ya 
 Hit them on the bad side with sliffs side on ya 
 Gurrileas gurrileas but pleas words to the miss 
 We got some shit going on one man down
