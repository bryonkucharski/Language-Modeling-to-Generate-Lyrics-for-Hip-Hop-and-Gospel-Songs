Ballin in a 600SL 
 Drop top with the fat V12 
 Money hella-long, smoke blunts not a bong 
 Niggas can't fuck 'cause I crunch 'em like Kong 
 I be deadly as The Predator 
 My .50 calibre Desert Eagle'll spread ya, and behead ya 
 Pistol wieghs a tonne, bullets come like a guillotine 
 Poisonous tips hit and explode through the war scene 
 Like morphine and heroin, I'm the shit 
 Every dope fiend needs a hit 
 Gangs need to stick at this gangsta shit 
 To take that monkey off their back and have 'em gettin' licks 
 I'm the neighbourhood's drama, dead man's trauma like O-Dogg 
 And Kane, I'm loc to the brain, got the afro 
 Padded, fully automatic decrease the statics 
 Two fingers spread, hittin 'em up and let 'em have it 
 Desperado outlaws through the dirt 
 Sendin BG's blastin, puttin' men to work 
 Trapped in America to die in these bloody streets 
 Goin' head up, with suckers all psyched up in heat 
 Murder, murder, kill, kill 
 California's the state where most caps get peeled 
 Back, catcha, pigs on a stretcher 
 Three strike law got us livin' under pressure 
 Know he wanna take mine, hand on his waistline 
 Side of his spine I get to dumpin with the Tek 9 
 Got his back smokin', crack that ass open 
 Bullet holes the size of a token 
 Got his ass chokin on piss and blood 
 Crooked ass piggies don't get no love, uh 
 Life or death, a .4-5 Smith and Wess 
 I had that nappy-headed ass stretched 
 If you try to dack me in my neighbourhood, I'm dumpin 
 And ya best ta run 'cause my BGz is comin' 
 Clips full of teflons, loc'd out and crazy 
 And they won't stop till you're pushin up daisies, uh 
 Body snatcher, caught up in a rapture 
 Black heads explode ya flesh when they capture 
 You don't wanna see me in my beanie wit my locs on 
 Ol' school mouth wit no *?style?* gettin' my smoke on 
 .4-5 stormin, rainin and pourin 
 Mobbin down floorin, psycho like Norman 
 Bates, no trace, no murder case 
 Innocent like OJ 
 House niggas get scoped by the revolution shooters 
 Fuck *?Glyn Craig?* then we gunnin down Cooper 
 'Cause he wanna send all niggas to the pen 
 Thinkin' that they fucked but Gz don't bend 
 Never been a snitch, *?Mark Keane?* can suck a dick 
 And fuck John Green, for bein prejudiced 
 Never liked rap, and did a nigga from a scrap 
 Yeah me to the max, but I'm back, piggies
