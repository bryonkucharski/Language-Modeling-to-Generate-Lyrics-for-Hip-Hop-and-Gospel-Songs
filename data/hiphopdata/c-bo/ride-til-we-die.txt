(Feat. 151, Mob Figgas) 
 And we be blastin, smashin for the loot 
 I, empty my strap and then I dash to my Coupe 
 Ain't no half-steppin, it's West Coast till I die 
 Keepin' the bundle and never fumble my 4-5 
 With only one life to live, nigga we're still ridin' 
 We attack and murder and watch the scrilla multiply 
 Fuck the funkity-five, big business and expeditions 
 If I die when I ride, don't leave shit to them bitches 
 I raise my right hand with a Tek and my left I swear I'll ride 
 Till my death or touch collide, till my judgment, till I rest 
 I'll be that gun smooth assassin, run with trues for blastin 
 Snatchin up money bags in organised crime fashion 
 Mafioso's mashin, the homicides is askin: 
 "Who did thew blastin? Was is it the Mob Figgas mashin?" 
 Ridin' with no maskets, jobs can't be soppy 
 Grippin the bail with the doves to bust you with my tongue 
 Now I'm a savage young nigga witta chopper 
 Motivated by Mob-type tactics, I'll blow your block up 
 ???? Sip to Cosby, out the game every time 
 Me and the Mob Figgas'll do the dirt and choke the 9's straight 
 Savage's up on the crime, but a cross and dwelling lavishly 
 Fuck some animosity but I might just cause a casualty 
 'Cause Boo the Hustler and Bo-Loc'll show ya, smell the aroma 
 We gon' ride till we die, ain't no glory in lettin it slide 
 For all you punks that never heard of these 
 And all you buster motherfuckers that wanna murder, these niggas 
 We ridin' till we die 
 Ain't lettin shit slide, dumpin 4-5's, ridin' till we die 
 ???? ???? California, I'm best ta warn ya you'll end up like Freddy 
 Fuckin' with my 'fetti, we mobbin three-deep in Chevy 
 AP-9, Bo and I rider, we pull licks 
 On a bitch, haven't you heard, we gets perved and hit the strip 
 Pitch black tint, ain't takin' no mo' shit 
 Gotta get these niggas with my chop and hit the block and suit their knots 
 And leave their whole block chalked up, got closed off of 4-54's 
 They hit the block and then I got gone 
 I'm never gang-related but dedicated to my niggas 
 My niggas be killers, drug-dealers and ho killers 
 Mackers in jackets, po' pimps, 9 packers 
 Got these ballers in *?scallers?*, livin' lawless, my niggas' flawless 
 Niggas with knowledge represent in grounds of college 
 White Acura coupes, pimpin' hoes and stackin loot 
 How much scrilla can I hustle up? Foldin my figures 
 Dottin my decimals with commas behind my O's, so... 
 You see gangs never work out the way I planned 
 'Cause I hustle all night, black eyes from gang fights 
 A mad nigga's drama and addicted to street life 
 I sold this paradise, sippin this game and pay the price 
 I watch the sun glisten off this ice, caught you slippin 
 Uzi, Mac and a jacker, young thief in the night 
 Dangerous minds still lookin' for a sign to reclude 
 As to what the fuck I'm pissed to do 
 If this rap game don't ??? for me, life might as well stop for me 
 Give in to failin from 2-11's so niggas call me *?Jagger?* 
 Ridin' till I die on you bastards 
 We ridin' practice on swell, pushin luxury with no els 
 Floss je-wels, Professional Baller, all about the dollars 
 And when you holler, we hit like pits, attackin collars 
 Ridin' with the 4-5, I'm shady and connivin 
 Choose dyin' before I be a punk to this shit 
 Dump when you funk when you with the clip 'cause if you slide, then you slip 
 Hollow tips rip chests, till confetti turn branch to spaghetti 
 Smash off like Andretti, are you ready? 
 It ain't no runnin' in a war, we're hardcore 
 Steadily toe-taggin bodies, yeah, we're dyin' some mo' 
 No respect to dump Tek's, smashin in Apollo Supersports 
 Cashin 'em out dollar stretch from Cali to New York 
 On a mission from mail, court and million dollar bails 
 Diamond je-wels, pushin 500 SL's 
 I'm just a born killer, cap peeler for my scrilla 
 Forever ride, nigga, until I get a hundred milla's 
 I'm ready to ride so slide, so need the pistol 
 Launch 'em like missiles as they shatter like crystals 
 I heard Bo whistle, it's time to move out 
 This mo' clear, we disappear and punch the big shootouts 
 Another slaughter, you're block was blown clear out the water 
 I land in your soldiers like dickin your daughter 
 Don't bother beggin me for no forgiveness 
 I'm in this to win this and takin' care of business 
 A witness to these murderous conspiracies 
 Will be found, dead to the ground and chopped with Glocks on both their 
 Knees 
 So please don't sweat the technique, it's the way I was trained 
 Murder men dictatin minds like Hitler dumpin Hussein 
 I bring the pain, till I will remain the top ace 
 Make you kiss my pinky ring then smack him dead in his face 
 'Cause I'm a RIDEAH...(and we'll just slide up and dump)
