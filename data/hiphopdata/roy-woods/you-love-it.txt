 In a drop top 6 on 
 Got it going on 
 Drop top in the lot at the spot 'cause I got to pick you up from me pops 
 Cause you working at the shop and you're trying to make money everyday because somebody gotta pay 
 You feeling all these ways 
 Cause you thinking of the days when you never had shit 
 It's okay admit they knew you were finished 
 I got you those clothes 'cause I knew you in it 
 Baby do you quit it? 
 We had it going on from the get-go 
 You had it going on with the set though 
 We had it going on when you puttin' on your bra 
 Before I step up in your room, got to hit it though 
 I know you really want me to come in it though 
 I'm seeing through you like a window 
 You know that I love you 
 You know that I got you 
 You know that I need you 
 You know that I want you 
 And you love it

 You know me and you love my shit 
 She had me and she lost me quick 
 I've been on the road tryin' find myself 
 They know me as Roy but don't know me well 
 I got you again 'cause they never did 
 Shit, I'm sipping you again 
 It's all for you at the end of the day 
 Girl I gave up my happiness 
 If it's love then I see you again 
 If it's not then you mess with your friends 
 I thought it was good till I came back again 
 Then she got a little drama with her man 
 Cheating on her every weekend 
 I get why you don't see him 
 But then why you can't see me 
 Though you love it 
 Understand that it came to some' 
 Shawty is this love 
 Oh, or is this pleasure 
 Same ways girl, it's good
