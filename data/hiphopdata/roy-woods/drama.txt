 Tumblr dreamin' ridin' in a Benz 
 You don't smoke, but it's cool while you're friends 
 Silvercity with your girls on the weekend 
 Seventeen, nights stay out past 10 
 House party ting turn up with your man's 
 Arguments all day with your 'rents 
 Just to go out, gotta fight for this shit 
 Gotta realize you're a high school girl 
 Don't matter how you put it, used to fuck niggas 
 But you don't trust niggas, nah-nah 
 But you don't trust niggas, nah-nah 
 But they still trust you 
 They still fuck with you 
 Anything you do, anything you do 
 Everything's for you 
 Drama is for you 
 Take that L, you lose 
 Take that L, you lose 
 No need to pretend, she got a little bit of drama with her friends 
 She got a little bit of drama with her friends 
 She got a little bit of drama with her friends 
 She got a little bit of drama with her friends 
 She got a little bit of drama with her friends 
 She got a little bit of drama with her friends

 Every lost girl I know is over 26 
 Every lost girl I know is just too afraid to admit it 
 You give your body to me, I'll body that like a savage 
 Give and take, you give it to 'em 
 They take that shit for granted, yeah 
 Different than it was before 
 People 'round you want it more 
 BFF, oh yeah, for sure 
 Wonder what they in it for 
 Take your last relationship 
 Look how good you treated him 
 You could birth like four of him 
 Girl, you never needed him 
 But they still need you 
 They still fuck with you 
 Anything you do, anything you do 
 Everything's for you 
 Drama is for you 
 Take that L, you lose 
 Girl, that's not me, oh 
 Girl, that's not me, oh 
 Girl, that's not me, oh 
 Girl, that's not me, oh 
 Girl, that's not me, oh
