Ooh 
 Woah, yeah, ooh 
 You're a queen and I'm a king, just me and you 
 Tonight is the night to act a fool, yeah 
 Talk to me and love me 
 Diss me and I'll act like something new 
 I need more weed 
 Hennessy, a little codeine, baby 
 Just keep it clean 
 PG, baby 
 'Til you and me be rated R and you're a star, baby 
 Miss, miss, miss 
 I miss, miss, miss everything 
 I miss, I miss, I miss 
 All I wanna do 
 Something new 
 Something new 
 All I wanna do 
 Something new 
 Talk, talk to me, don't stop 
 Talk back to me, don't stop 
 Dancin' on this beat 
 I got memories for you 
 I love those walks and talks on beaches 
 Like we out in Egypt 
 You give me, mm-mm, cold fever 
 I am not too tired to go home 
 Can I take you back up to my room, girl? 
 I wanna do something brand new 
 Teach you things that you ain't know was possible 
 But tonight, girl, you are in my care 
 Miss, miss, miss 
 I miss, miss, miss everything 
 I miss, I miss, I miss 
 All I wanna do 
 Something new 
 Something new 
 All I wanna do 
 Something new 
 I wanna know what's goin' on 
 So tell me why we talkin' on this phone 
 Girl, I wanna know right now, right now, right now 
 No mistakes, no mistakes, nah nah 
 I cannot have complaints, no complaints, na na 
 I feel like Offset, no complaints, na na na 
 Oh na na, oh na na 
 Talk to me mama 
 You say "Talk to me papa" 
 Oh, yah yah yah 
 Miss, miss, miss 
 I miss, miss, miss everything 
 I miss, I miss, I miss 
 All I wanna do 
 Something new 
 Something new 
 All I wanna do 
 Something new
