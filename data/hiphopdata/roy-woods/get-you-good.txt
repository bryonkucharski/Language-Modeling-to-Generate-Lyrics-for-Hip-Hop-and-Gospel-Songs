I feel like it's been a long while now since you've been gone 
 Maybe it's 'cause we had sex, that time it was too damn good 
 Don't let your panties get too wet, let me take it off for yah 
 Who else is gonna be a man to yah? 
 I know that I'm young, but I'm just bein' honest 
 You're with me right now, baby let's go further 
 'Cause I'm gonna get you good 
 You don't fuck with niggas in your hood 
 Southside nigga and the name is Roy 
 Ex-girlfriend knows I've been up there 
 Everybody hear, don't know why they ask 
 I want you to show me yourself 
 Since I'm always here, I'm only gone for a minute 
 Gone for a minute 
 Whenever I, push to start you, I don't want you to finish 
 Just keep ridin' 
 Since I'm always here, I'm only gone for a minute 
 Gone for a minute 
 Whenever I, push to start you, I don't want you to finish 
 Just keep ridin' 
 'Cause I'm gon' get you good 
 There ain't nothin' wrong with a little play 
 'Cause I'm gon' get you good 
 There ain't nothin' wrong with a little play 
 'Cause I'm gon' get you good 
 There ain't nothin' wrong with a little play 
 'Cause I'm gon' get you good 
 Get you good, get you good, get you good 
 'Cause I'm gon' get you good 
 I can't get enough of you 
 Shawty show me what's up with you 
 There's lots of things that I want to do 
 But tell me what you can do 
 'Cause I know there's things that he didn't show you 
 Let me be your teacher while up in the bedroom 
 Make your neck beg with my goatee 
 Don't press pause, girl we're on repeat 
 Let's get high, blow it down, 6 feet 
 She could love me, well you know me 
 He can't love you when you're with me 
 Let me dick you down, baby come and give me all 
 This is me now, forget about who they know 
 Never had a woman that had showed me love 
 So I never felt this feeling before 
 Gon' and give me some, I'm giddy for more 
 Since I'm always here, I'm only gone for a minute 
 Gone for a minute 
 Whenever I, push to start you, I don't want you to finish 
 Just keep ridin' 
 Since I'm always here, I'm only gone for a minute 
 Gone for a minute 
 Whenever I, push to start you, I don't want you to finish 
 Just keep ridin' 
 'Cause I'm gon' get you good 
 There ain't nothin' wrong with a little play 
 'Cause I'm gon' get you good 
 There ain't nothin' wrong with a little play 
 'Cause I'm gon' get you good 
 There ain't nothin' wrong with a little play 
 'Cause I'm gon' get you good 
 Get you good, get you good, get you good 
 'Cause I'm gon' get you good 
 'Cause I'm gon' get you good 
 I'm gon' get you good 
 I'm gon' get you good 
 Girl I'm gon' get you good 
 Get you good, get you good 
 I'm gon' get you good 
 Get you good, get you good, get you 
 Girl I'm gon' get you good
