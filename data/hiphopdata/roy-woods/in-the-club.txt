 Just know, it ain't fuckin' love 
 She's lookin' like my ex, maybe I'll take her down 
 I'm flying to Vancity, ooh these bitches around 
 I have no patience, I'm tryna get with you right now 
 She knows I roll with the 6 god, with my angels 
 Gripping on her body, it's as soft as a Danish 
 I know you don't understand me, I speak a different language 
 I bust a French up on her, she poppin' off a Spanish 
 Fucking with a mamacita that say she from Paris 
 I'm getting to the money and the money come alive 
 I'm getting to the money and the money come alive 
 I ain't got no time for niggas that are tryna fuck with us 
 And then she pour some Henny, now my head spinning around 
 I'm rolling off a bean while my shorty put it down 
 I'm feeling just like François, lightskins around 
 I got her booted up she don't wanna come down, no

 You got a side nigga and you know he ain't shit 
 Why you staying with him? 
 You looking at me like goddamn he the shit 
 How am I gon' get him? 
 I'm leaning sideways smoking in the driveway 
 And she up on me while her booty calling 
 If you getting jealous just slide over me 
 More speed ahoy that's the link in me 
 Looking like she been tricking these hoes indeed 
 And she wanna take the molly and give it to me 
 I'm feeling myself so fresh, so clean 
 All white O.V.O 10 swagging on me
