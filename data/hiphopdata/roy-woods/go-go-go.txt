 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa 
 I see how you change at night, nothing like you're basement lies 
 Chevrolet trip half an hour ride, take a nigga back to the Southside 
 I'm giving it all to you, naked and raw, baby raw as my heart 
 Feel the pain as it thumps 
 I feel used on my chest, it ain't nothing at all 
 'Cause I'm here for you, I'm making love to you 
 You're letting it all go, go, go, go 
 I'm here for you, I'm making love to you 
 You're letting it all go, go, go go 
 Let you're pain go, go, go, go 
 I let my pain go, go, go go 
 Let your pain go, go, go go 
 I let my pain go, go, go, go 
 Let your pain go, go, go go 
 I let my pain go, go, go, go 
 Let your pain go, go, go go 
 I need what I never had, you had, thought you had a spot 
 So show me what it is right now, girl yeah 
 'Cause I been in the Lost and Found 
 And you are the only thing inside 
 Brand new heart is why I'm at the bonfire 
 Pick and choose what you need and who you want, girl I'm there 
 You can call on me when you know there's no one else 
 You got away, bet I'm down for the moment, shit 
 You the real shit, hold me down for a fucking spliff 
 Whenever I'm stressed (Whenever I'm stressed) 
 You hold me down the best 
 I see how you change at night 
 Nothing like your basement lies 
 Chevrolet trip half an hour ride 
 And take a nigga back to the Southside 
 You're letting it all go, go, go, go 
 Let you're pain go, go, go, go 
 I let my pain go, go, go go 
 Let your pain go, go, go go 
 I let my pain go, go, go, go 
 Let your pain go, go, go go 
 I let my pain go, go, go, go 
 Let your pain go, go, go go
