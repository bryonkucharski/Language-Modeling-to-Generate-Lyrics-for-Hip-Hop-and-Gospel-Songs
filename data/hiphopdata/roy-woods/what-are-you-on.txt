Oh, what are you on? 
 When you get with us 
 What should I know? 
 When you get up 
 Oh, what are you on?

 Smoke blunts, rather pop one to get off 
 VVS make your lady dance from afar 
 Roll it fast 'cause marijuana is my cologne 
 Lil' baby come and smoke with me 
 He ain't no friend of me 
 Bad bitches still the only girls that can be friends with me 
 Fuck you good, pass you to the left, to your enemy (to your enemy) 
 What you want? Money and Patrón 
 Before you get it free I'd rather tell you what to tell 
 They know this isn't me but shit happens when you get older 
 Niggas didn't think I'd make it far when I told them 
 Out there in the woods lookin' for peace out with my soldiers 
 Everybody lookin' at me like I can help them 
 I know what I meant for my nigga, I'm respected 
 My life is for my people, they been movin' reckless 
 Trap, job, plat' niggas workin' restless 
 All you want is my money but do you respect it?

 I worked for everything I got 
 You don't know how to treat a boss 
 My thick girl stay with thunder thighs 
 Lightning bolt didn't kill her this time 
 I know she like my style 
 Ain't no asking why, two cups at a time 
 'Bout to multiply 
 I have been on more than one, two, three, four, five 
 Get high 
 I know what I meant for my nigga, I'm respected 
 My life is for my people, they been movin' reckless 
 Trap, job, plat' niggas workin' restless 
 All you want is my money but do you respect it?
