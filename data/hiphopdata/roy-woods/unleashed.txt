I still don't like myself 
 Walk around the fucking city, they still buy my shit 
 We sell SLV's just discovered in last 
 Is it crazy to simply talk to God sometimes 
 I feel the pressure, better make it in last, it's getting harder 
 Pussy pussy you got it, the fifty yard I caught 
 Still awesome and flossin' and knocking out the ref 
 Some niggas want the shit I got before I even got it 
 I'm a south side nigga for life, I been that 
 A 333 X-Boeing, my wing span 
 Tonight's still calls for me and these mats 
 What's next there, you went too quick 
 This the shit that make a nigga unleashed 
 We are rough, gotta eat 
 Me and my niggas are unleashed 
 Terrorize the motherfucking streets 
 What you hearin' now, this'll make us unleashed 
 We are rough, gotta eat 
 Me and my niggas are unleashed 
 Terrorize the motherfucking streets 
 What you hearin' now 
 Should I attempt suicide again? 
 I still don't see the point in us living in hell 
 They only watch, this ain't much help 
 I need a cheque so I can protect more than myself 
 I am the watch, paradise never seemed so far 
 Could use a blunt to the face to forget these problems 
 For a while, 'cause I done had a enough of this shit 
 I know I don't see much, so I'm tryna' save us 
 I made a mistake fucking her raw 
 Dunno her affection, think she's innocent, oh no no no no 
 Where your shit at from, the Louis store? nah 
 Don't fake it to make it for the movie, role nah 
 You can stay on your block and get your pay though 
 It ain't even much to get out the state though 
 Rents kicked you out you need a new place though 
 But can you stay, yeah 
 This the shit that make a nigga unleashed 
 We are rough, gotta eat 
 Me and my niggas are unleashed 
 Terrorize the motherfucking streets 
 What you hearin' now, this'll make us unleashed 
 We are rough, gotta eat 
 Me and my niggas are unleashed 
 Terrorize the motherfucking streets 
 What you hearin' now
