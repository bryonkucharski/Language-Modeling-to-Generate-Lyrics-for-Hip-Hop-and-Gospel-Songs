It's been good, but I gotta pack it up 
 From your hood, I'm gonna travel far 
 I know you're stuck and probably think that I don't care 
 I did too much as you did too, so we're both fair 
 I can't get enough from you, so I need to be alone 
 Time to let my pain, go, go, go, go, go 
 I don't wanna start fiending for your love 
 Just let me go now and I'll be back soon 
 You don't have to tell me that you don't care 
 I know you do 
 Don't tell me it's just a girl ting 
 Oh, ahlie 
 You think that I love her, but I don't want her 
 Anyway 
 She knows about me and I know about her 
 She knows about me and I know about her 
 She knows about me and I know about her 
 She knows about me and I know about her 
 She knows about me and I know about her 
 She knows about me and I know about her 
 She knows about me and I know about her 
 She knows about me and I know about her 
 Knows my style, can we go out? 
 She's not that foreign but she's still bad 
 She don't like problems, not with her man 
 I'm so damn sorry, I am not like... 
 That man you wanted, I am not that 
 I'm by my lonely when she's gone back to home 
 I swear I still don't like myself at all 
 But right now, right now, I don't wanna talk 
 You don't have to tell me that you don't care 
 I know you do 
 Don't tell me it's just a girl ting 
 Oh, ahlie 
 You think that I love her, but I don't want her 
 Anyway... 
 She knows about me and I know about her 
 She knows about me and I know about her 
 She knows about me and I know about her 
 She knows about me and I know about her 
 She knows about me and I know about her 
 She knows about me and I know about her 
 She knows about me and I know about her 
 She knows about me and I know about her 
 She knows about me, me, me 
 Me, me, yeah, knows about me 
 Knows about me 
 She knows about me 
 She knows about me 
 I want her love 
 For a while 
 Let's get it on 
 (Let's get it on) 
 Let's drive through baby, (skrr, skrr) 
 Let's get it on 
 Oh, smokin' outside 
 And you know it all 
 Hey, why you walkin' like you know it all 
 (Why you walkin' like you know it all) 
 Shawty I got feelings, I show it all 
 (I got feelings, I show it all) 
 Getting down, getting down with you 
 (Getting down) 
 Shawty to bad for you 
 (Bad for you) 
 A song that I'm writing on my own 
 (Writing on my own) 
 Hope I'm not putting anything too personal 
 Fuck 
 And now you know 
 And now you know 
 Let's get it on 
 She's stealing my heart 
 Stealing in my heart like I never had love 
 Had love baby
