Oh 
 If it's time to make your spouse feel good 
 I make sure that you got all your plans done right 
 'Cause I'm not sure 
 If she was right 
 That I don't really know what they can tell me 
 About our love so special 
 What do they know about our flavor? 
 Tell me if it's real so I don't slap myself 
 'Cause there's no point in hidin' 
 I feel ignited with your love 
 It's so obvious, I'm sorry that it's pure 
 Yeah 
 I think I need a little bit of lovin' 
 A little bit of somethin' 
 I think I need a little bit of lovin' 
 A little bit of somethin' from you 
 Woah, I think I need a little bit of lovin' 
 A little bit of somethin', yeah 
 'Cause this love is all I have of you 
 If you like me now, wait 'til you get used to me 
 This is not no sit down go & get off your feet 
 We would dance all night, girl come and rock with me 
 This ain't the same old love that you can get every week (no, no) 
 Take a trip around the world with me (come on girl) 
 I will take a chance to get down with you (get down, get down) 
 My past is my past, leave that back (leave that behind) 
 I'll give myself to you, woah 
 I think I need a little bit of lovin' 
 A little bit of somethin' 
 I think I need a little bit of lovin' 
 A little bit of somethin' from you 
 Woah, I think I need a little bit of lovin' 
 A little bit of somethin', yeah 
 'Cause this love is all I have of you 
 It's all in her eyes 
 What we share, you and I (yeah) 
 It is no more, not the same 
 But it's all that we made 
 I think I need a little bit of lovin' 
 A little bit of somethin' 
 I think I need a little bit of lovin' 
 A little bit of somethin' from you 
 Woah, I think I need a little bit of lovin' 
 A little bit of somethin', yeah ( 
 just a little bit, just a little bit 
 ) 
 'Cause this love is all I have of you ( 
 yeah, yeah 
 )
