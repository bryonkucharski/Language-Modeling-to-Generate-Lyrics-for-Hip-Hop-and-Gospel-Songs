I don't want to be a menace 
 I don't want to be the menace to fuck up your mind again 
 I don't want to be the menace 
 I don't want to be the menace 
 I don't want to be the menace 
 I don't want to be the menace to fuck up your mind again 
 Yeah 
 I told you before I knew it 
 Girl I was being foolish 
 I knew I shouldn't of done it but I did it two times again 
 I'm sorry 
 I know you do not want to call me 
 And I understand it 
 Can I speak some Spanish, "te amo my darling," babe 
 So what, if I put weed in my car 
 And I roll a purple cup 
 Right now I'm not feeling good 
 So I rolled in my hood 
 Southside, Southsiders for life 
 You understand that, right? 
 I don't want to be the menace 
 I don't want to be the menace 
 I don't want to be the menace 
 I don't want to be the menace to fuck up your mind again 
 I don't want to be the menace 
 I don't want to be the menace 
 I don't want to be the menace 
 I don't want to be the menace to fuck up your mind again 
 Your mind again 
 Your mind again 
 I've been, so gone, too long, so long 
 My moms been so worried for so long 
 Praying on these I know, I've 
 I've been feeling like this 
 I need to talk 
 I need to walk away now, from you girl 
 These problems, I can't have 'em, I can't solve it 
 Feel I should pull out the revolver 
 It's fucked how I've been feeling suicidal 
 Maybe I should reach for the Bible 
 I'm still my only rival 
 I don't want to be the menace 
 I don't want to be the menace 
 I don't want to be the menace 
 I don't want to be the menace to fuck up your mind again 
 I don't want to be the menace 
 I don't want to be the menace 
 I don't want to be the menace 
 I don't want to be the menace to fuck up your mind again 
 UTU 
 Back then I was able to, hit her up like 
 "What are you saying though" 
 She said "I'm cooling baby" 
 Come through maybe, my kung-fu baby 
 Kick it with a nigga 
 Come on my Lola 
 She grabbed woods, we're smoking down by the hour 
 Sex in the shower, it come up for hours 
 Sex, sex, sex, sex in the city 
 Raw, raw, raw, raw 
 Bitch I'm, raw, raw, raw, raw 
 Hold up, hold up, hold up, raw, raw, raw, raw 
 Like I'm motherfucking raw, raw, raw, raw 
 Hold up, bitch I'm fucking, raw, hold up, raw 
 Still in the 6 I'm a rider (x4) (raw)...
