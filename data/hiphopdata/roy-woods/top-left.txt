Ooh 
 Ooh 
 Ooh nah 
 Oh no 
 You tell me that you want me 
 But then you not responding 
 I'm looking through our convo 
 Just a blank screen open 
 Now I'm lookin' at reflections 
 You always give me suspicions 
 No lie, me I tell no lie 
 You stay I say later, for me what you don't like 
 Say your body, astounding, when you found me 
 You lost you 
 Said you'll find it, you'll find what? 
 Don't know what lost inside you 
 I don't need you comin' 'round 
 Told you I don't need you 'round 
 If you wanna stay, then obey the rules baby 
 Top left get left behind 
 Cause, top left, if you wanna get left like Beyonce 
 To the left, to the left 
 I be acting right, gotta push you to the left 
 Uncalled, but you wanna see me daily 
 Can't talk to you 'cause I know all your ways 
 On job, mami, I done see everything 
 Fresh start if you gon' act properly 
 (Say goodbye) 
 'Cause I lied into haze 
 If it's a vibe, simply talk to me 
 Don't cry getting in your feelings in bed 
 When I'm at your side, yeah 
 Watching people drive on the road 
 Left side watch around 'round with you 
 I'll let you take the wheel if you want Mrs 
 I don't mind if you pull up to your mama 
 Go ahead, girl I know you duckin' low 
 Got shooters and I know they 'round you 
 Double-O 7 girl, this ain't no 64 
 Say your body, astounding, when you found me 
 You lost you 
 Said you'll find it, find what? 
 Don't know what lost inside you 
 I don't need you comin' 'round 
 Told you I don't need you now 
 If you wanna stay, then obey the rules baby 
 Top left get left behind 
 Cause, top left, if you wanna get left like Beyonce 
 To the left, to the left 
 I be acting right, gotta push you to the left 
 Uncalled, but you wanna see me daily 
 Can't talk to you 'cause I know all your ways 
 On job, Miami, I done see everything 
 Fresh start if you gon' act properly 
 (Say goodbye) 
 'Cause I lied in a haze 
 If it's a vibe, simply talk to me 
 Don't cry getting in your feelings in bed 
 When I'm at your side
