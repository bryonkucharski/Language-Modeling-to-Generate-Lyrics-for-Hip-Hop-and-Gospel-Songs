1:44AM, almost done 
 I could pop another pill tonight 
 Even though I don't really want one 
 The Xanax got me on a flight 
 I don't need much 
 I just want to get a buzz from the blunt 
 Sipping beverage here on my own 
 I just want to wyle with you 
 Shawty outside getting high while I do that shit on my own 
 Know I'm top 5 for the week and the night 
 On the billboards dressing her out on her own 
 I drink alcohol in the fall and the summer 
 Or wintertime cold, my beer ice cold 
 She ain't outdoors and her heart just cold as is 
 As is, as is, as is 
 She ain't outdoors and her heart just cold as is 
 As is, as is, as is 
 She ain't outdoors and her heart just cold as is 
 As is, as is, as is 
 She ain't outdoors and her heart just cold as is 
 As is, as is, as is 
 Oh 
 Yeah 
 Oh 
 Yeah 
 And her heart just cold as is 
 As is, as is, as is 
 I don't want much, I just need your love 
 As is, as is, as is 
 Baby, I'm trying to win this back 
 I needed love 
 But now you're gone 
 As is, as is 
 Baby I'm falling 
 Away from you 
 Body go bad 
 She might not even blow if she goes back home 
 But I know 
 Ooh, that she needs sex 
 Oh ooh la, oh ha 
 Oh ooh la, oh ha 
 Oh hey 
 Oh-way ooh-woah
