Heard you got a lot to say 
 Maybe you should say less 
 You ain't gotta tell no lie 
 Maybe you can confess 
 100 fahrenheit in my room 
 Maybe you should undress 
 No talk say less 
 (Say less, say less, say less, say less, say less) 
 (Say less, say less, say less, say less, say less) 
 (Say less, say less, say less, say less, say less, say less) 
 (Say less, say less, say less, say less, say less, say less, say less) 
 (I be, I be, I be) 
 Falling in love with women, I don't know what I see in 'em 
 More times I be lonely so I don't know what I be feeling 
 Gotta do more, say less, how I'm living 
 (B-Town, 6 side shit, know what I'm talking about) 
 Don't talk no more 'cause I know what you doing 
 Got man's to the side but you say you're alone 
 Money on sight now your eyes on gold 
 Can't take your ass shopping, tripping on Jimmy Choo's 
 Yeah, said you gonna stay over for the night, but you got me waiting 
 Barely said a thing, got me here alone without conversation, yeah 
 I feel beside myself, I understand me 
 Had to re-align myself or else I would have lost me (would've lost me, would've lost me, whoa no) 
 But I found myself, in my youth 
 Time well spent in the booth, oh 
 Yeah

 Less, yeah (Say less, say less, say less, say less, say less, say less) 
 Baby girl, I (Say less, say less, say less, say less, say less, say less, say less)
