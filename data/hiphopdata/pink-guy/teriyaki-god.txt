Dream a while 
 Before it is time to go, go, go, go 
 Ladies and gentlemen, this is karaoke night (oh) 
 The only night that requires someone to hold me tight (oh) 
 To keep me back from these wack, withering fucks 
 When I spray them down, they're going to have more holes than hermaphrodites 
 Grab the mic, feel the bumps like a doctor might 
 Fuck a kind word to reduct the fight 
 I'm taking it all, boy, they say that I'm hogging the portions 
 Always back in your girl like a homesick abortion, like 
 This a story about a young boy, unemployed 
 Bastardized, coy looking fuck with the loudest noise 
 Run Versace, run Versace, run Versace 
 With a rubber band attached to your origami belt around my waist (what) 
 Hidden doors to black rap like the burqas 
 Off the market dirty black acts like a circus (what) 
 Like whoa 
 Close your eyes 
 The music is soft and warm 
 Breath, a while 
 Before it is time to go, go, go, go 
 (Uh, yeah) 
 Motherfuckers want a piece of all the action 
 Running 'round in circles, the police will never catch us 
 Fucking with your boy can leave you running with the patches 
 And I guarantee you playing against the flame with some matches 
 Close your eyes 
 The music is soft and warm 
 Breath, a while 
 Before it is time to go 
 It's been a long time 
 It's been a long time 
 Let darkness take away the pain 
 (Breh) 
 How, can we feel the same? 
 (Skrrt) 
 How, can we feel the same?
