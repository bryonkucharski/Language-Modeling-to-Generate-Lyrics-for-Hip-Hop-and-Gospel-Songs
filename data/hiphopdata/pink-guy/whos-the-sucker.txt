Who's the sucker mane, who's the sucker mane? 
 Who's the sucker mane, who's the sucker mane? 
 Who's the sucker mane, who's the sucker mane? 
 Who's the sucker mane, who's the sucker mane? 
 When I was younger 
 I used to play with play dough 
 Now that I'm older 
 I still play with play dough 
 We go play basketball in the park 
 My skin is darker than tree bark 
 Just when you thought 
 We couldn't get any nicer 
 We go around the place 
 Looking for that verginer 
 Right when we were about to go to bed 
 This sucker came up and he started to said 
 Who's the sucker mane, who's the sucker mane? 
 Who's the sucker mane, who's the sucker mane? 
 Who's the sucker mane, who's the sucker mane? 
 Who's the sucker mane, who's the sucker mane? 
 Back in the hood they call me Salamander 
 Now look at me, they call me David 
 Dirty David, so oh please 
 Hop off my swag and choke on these nuts 
 I run away from police 
 Like macaroni 
 I'm holding my scrotum 
 I used to drink vegetable juice and then I vomit 
 So I drink fruit juice and I vomit 
 I once found a dead dog on the road 
 I left him there on the road 
 You want to know why? because we stir-fry 
 He came up and we started to said 
 Who's the sucker mane, who's the sucker mane? 
 Who's the sucker mane, who's the sucker mane? 
 Who's the sucker mane, who's the sucker mane? 
 Who's the sucker mane, who's the sucker mane? 
 No? Okay
