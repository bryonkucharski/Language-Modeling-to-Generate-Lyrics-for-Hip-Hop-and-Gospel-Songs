I got a story that'll waggle your eyes 
 I got a burger and a thingy of fries, I think we disguise 
 Our lives when we speak, but we show it with what we eat 
 We defeat eternal demons with heaps of internal shitty meat 
 Ronald had a dream when he was sucking his mom's titty 
 He wanted to palm cities, rockin' his fall hoodie 
 In this heat? Nah man, he ain't no clown 
 He don't need another guardian to hold the fucking place down 
 Ronald, I never got to say thank you 
 If you caught me at a KFC, I never meant to hurt you 
 I tore down a thousand Burger Kings for talking shit 
 Have 'em lost for words on some Stephen Hawking shit 
 This cancer's got these little kids biting lips 
 If burgers kill then fuck it, I'm gonna die from it 
 I'll fucking die for you Ronald, I hope you understand 
 Avoid beef and I'm taking your ass to Pakistan 
 See if Ronald McDonald would have to run a bottle shop 
 Ronald would unload a couple shots on these fucking cops 
 See McDonald's is the finest China quality 
 That make your legs wobble a lava lamp holding Socrates is 
 Less post modern than Ronald, 'cause in a thousand years 
 You and I'll be gone but the patties keep flipping 
 The chicken is still delicious, the living expense is limitless 
 So why the fuck you eating salad, bitch? 
 See back in '48 was when I heard of this magic place 
 When the atom bomb crushed a small country in it's natural state 
 Rebuilt itself into a fine little real estate 
 And reeled in any American chains with exceptional taste 
 But... 
 They don't understand
