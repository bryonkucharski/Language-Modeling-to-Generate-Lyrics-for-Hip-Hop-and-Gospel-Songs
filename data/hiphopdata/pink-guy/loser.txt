To all the MCs who battle me 
 I'm calling out my black friends 
 Wait I don't have any 
 I got hacked by a couple dudes on Facebook 
 Now I got my friends questioning my sexuality 
 But I can spit more bars than a jail cell 
 Got more quitters than a shop that doesn't pay well 
 I always walk with a limp 
 'Cause when I get my ass beat 
 I ain't no athlete now that;s deep 
 Haters on my dick can hop off these huge balls 
 Lose self confidence and cry in the bathroom stalls 
 Now am I that mean? 
 If your gonna razor blade yourself 
 You better use some shaving cream 
 Yes I'm offensive, I'm hopping all fences 
 You act all hard but inside you're defenseless 
 You're kinda stupid, you're cockeyed 
 A moron that likes to pick fights but I think you picked the wrong guy 
 See I'm a loser 
 But I can tell the difference when it comes to skinny rappers starting things without a reason 
 And you're kinda gay 
 I don't care what you internet geeks say 
 Like anarchy 
 Racism 
 Child slavery 
 Then it's all good 
 Racial stereotypes 
 Did I mention anarchy 
 What about racism 
 Either way it's all good
