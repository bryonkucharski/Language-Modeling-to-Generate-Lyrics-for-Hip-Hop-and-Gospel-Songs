Ooh I fucked a girl's titties! 
 Ooh I fucked a girl's titties! 
 Ooh I fucked a girl's titties! 
 Ooh I fucked a girl's titties! 
 Ooh I fucked a girl's titties! 
 Ooh I fucked a girl's titties! 
 Ooh I fucked a girl's titties! 
 Ooh I fucked a girl's titties! 
 Oh I'm sorry man, I didn't know! 
 JK, JK, I knew all along! 
 And she's sucking on my hose 
 I go twelve inch deep in the pussy 
 After twenty minutes you can drive a fucking Jeep in the pussy 
 Know what I'm talking 'bout? 
 Smack her in the pussy 
 When I pee it burns 
 Let it burn like George Bushy 
 I regret to inform you I fucked your girl's pussy 
 Man I swear I didn't know 
 JK, JK, JK, JK I knew all along! 
 I just fucked your girl before this song 
 And I know it's kind of wrong 
 When she's sucking on my dong 
 And she's so fat like a land whale 
 Uh, shoot that poon with a harpoon 
 Yeah, I just wanna lick a whale in the fucking whale pussy 
 That's why I fucked your fat girlfriend you fucking nerd! 
 But she's so nice 
 But she's so nice 
 But she's so nice 
 But she's so nice 
 But she's so nice 
 But she's so nice 
 She's so nice 
 She's so nice 
 She lets me use her body 
 But she's so nice 
 But she's so nice 
 But she's so nice 
 But she's so nice 
 But she's so nice 
 But she's so nice 
 Yeah, treat her like a bitch 
 I fuck her in the ass and I fuck her in the tits 
 If she can handle that then I'll let her suck my dick 
 And her man is coming back so I better make it quick 
 Yeah, you know who you are you piece of shit 
 Your girlfriend's always sucking on my dick like a Slim Jim stick 
 So next time you go down on her clit 
 Tell me how my dick tastes 
 Tell me how my motherfucking dick tastes 
 But she's so nice 
 But she's so nice 
 But she's so nice 
 But she's so nice 
 But she's so nice 
 But she's so nice 
 I treat her badly 
 But she comes back, every time 
 It goes to show 
 That none of these hoes 
 Are worth a dime 
 But she's so nice 
 But she's so nice 
 But she's so nice 
 But she's so nice 
 But she's so nice 
 But she's so nice
