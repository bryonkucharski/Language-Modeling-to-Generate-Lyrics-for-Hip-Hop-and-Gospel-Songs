Eat the pussy like a watermelon 
 Eat the pussy like a watermelon 
 Eat the pussy like a watermelon 
 Slurp, slurp 
 Slurp, slurp 
 I eat pussy like I have a disease 
 And the antidote is inside the pussy 
 People don't like me 'cause I touch them 
 Mad pussy like Tom and Jerry 
 I eat pussy like I have diabe-tees 
 And the insulin is inside my pee-pee 
 Oh! Yes, you know this 
 I have a big staff like Moses 
 Alakazam and abracadabra 
 I go hard like Viagra 
 If pussy was a vegetable... 
 I'd grow it 
 That pussy so good 
 That it's got me singing a little song and it goes like 
 Gimme that pussy, yeah 
 Gimme that puss-ay 
 They call me the pussy man 
 Oh pussy man 
 Where you gonna run to 
 They call me the pussy man 
 Pussy man 
 Pussy man where ya gonna run to? 
 Eat the pussy like a watermelon 
 Eat the pussy like a watermelon 
 Eat the pussy like a watermelon 
 Slurp, slurp 
 Slurp, slurp
