 It goes pop-pop-pop when it's coming out my asshole 
 And it feels good 
 And it feels good (It feels good!) 
 And it feels good 
 And it feels good tonight (I broke a dog's neck!) 
 In the darkest of times 
 You're there for me (I love you!) 
 In the darkest of times 
 These anal beads take care of me (They take care of me!) 
 Shove it up real good (Please?) 
 Now it kind of hurts (Ow...) 
 Oh, no! (What?) 
 And I need an ambulance! (Oh my God, it's huge!) 
 Call the ambulance! (Someone needs to kill that thing!) 
 Now my ass is bleeding 
 Ass is bleeding 
 Ass is bleeding 
 Ass is bleeding 
 Ass is bleeding 
 Ain't nothing wrong with that 
 Ain't nothing wrong with that 
 Ain't nothing wrong with that 
 Ain't nothing wrong with that 
 My ass is bleeding 
 Ass is bleeding 
 Ass is bleeding 
 Ass is bleeding 
 Ass is bleeding 
 Ass is bleeding 
 Ass is bleeding 
 Ass is bleeding 
 Ass is bleeding 
 Ass is bleeding 
 Ass is bleeding
