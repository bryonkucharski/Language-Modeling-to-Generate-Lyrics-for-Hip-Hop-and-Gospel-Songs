We fall again, we fall again 
 We fall again 
 We fall again 
 Slow down 
 We fall again, we fall again 
 We fall again (ooh) 
 We fall again 
 When you turn around, I lose vision 
 Got me running deep in the superstition, and I 
 Can't believe my fucking eyes 
 Yet a thousand years, I never thought I would see you come from beneath me 
 I feel like falling 
 I feel like falling 
 We fall again, we fall again (yeah) 
 We fall again (ooh) 
 We fall again 
 When you turn around, I lose vision (we) 
 Got me running deep 
 Fall again, we fall again 
 We fall again 
 We fall again
