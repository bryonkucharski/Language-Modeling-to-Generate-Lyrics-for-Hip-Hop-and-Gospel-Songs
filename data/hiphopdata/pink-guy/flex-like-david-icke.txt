 These UFOs are real 
 And these documents are proof, man 
 Aliens are here, man

 The Illuminati's listenin' 
 Hitler never died 
 The Holocaust's a lie 
 Six million Jews? 
 Show me the proof 
 The moon landing's fake 
 They never went to space 
 Our president's a clone 
 He always gets replaced 
 When he fuck up 
 The Jews are reptilians 
 Bonding Israel to kill the Palestinians 
 Man, when you wake up 
 I hope you know the truth, man 
 'Cause David Icke was right

 Back in the records they just believed s--s-ctually that 
 The ancients and the accounts of the ancients, these entities form different names. 
 Some people call them a serpent race, some people call them demonic. 
 In the Islamic culture they call them djinns. 
 All different names
