Man, don't you hate when you're all like 
 "Man, I wanna kill some rats" 
 And then the, the bitch-ass animal company is like 
 "No" 
 So, what now? 
 PETA on my dick 
 PETA, PETA on my dick 
 PETA on my dick 
 PETA, PETA on my dick 
 PETA on my dick 
 PETA, PETA on my dick 
 PETA on my dick 
 PETA, PETA on my dick (Ooh!) 
 I've been shooting dogs with BB guns since I was five 
 If you want to witness, you can come and see me live (Ooh!) 
 I be trapping cats in AC units all the time 
 Let them freeze, baby 
 Give the mice a head start, please, baby 
 PETA trynna take away the fun life 
 They always sending people to my condo 
 Like, "Who you is, and how you getting all this mammal fur?" 
 I tell them, go ahead, and check-a check that bank roll 
 I got a camel-fur coat, gator-skin duffel bag 
 Chinese labrador rug price tags 
 Sea turtle shell, money clip, hella tablerags 
 And handkerchief straight out of the African wild 
 Yeah, I don't give a fuck about the dolphins on my back 
 Man, I know a guy, who knows a guy, I get it like that 
 With a polar bear ceiling fan cooling down my back 
 And a kangaroo pouch to hold my diamonds and rags 
 I sewed a bunch of rats to a quilt 
 All this fur got me feeling like Cruella de Vil 
 I've been lurking on my neighbor's dalmatians for weeks, man 
 If you trying to split the profit, call my pager for deets 
 They try to shut me down, that's a no, no 
 They all trying to hit me with the low blows 
 But I never pay attention, I just pay in cash 
 If you trying to ask some questions, man, get off my fucking ass, uh 
 PETA on my dick 
 PETA, PETA on my dick 
 PETA on my dick 
 PETA, PETA on my dick 
 PETA on my dick 
 PETA, PETA on my dick 
 PETA on my dick 
 PETA, PETA on my dick (Ooh!)
