I do it for my streets 
 I do it for my hood 
 I do it for my momma 
 I do what's good 
 I do it for my cat 
 I do it for my dog 
 I do it for my hamster 
 I do it for my fish 
 Ooh I do it for my hood 
 I do it for my hood 
 Ooh I do it for my hood 
 I do it for my hood 
 If you wanna come to my hood come test me 
 I'm chillin' in the streets hanging out like my testes 
 I do it for my city 
 I do it for my hood 
 I do it for my city 
 I do it for the streets man 
 Ooh I do it for my hood (pop, pop, pop!) 
 I do it for my hood (yeah!) 
 Ooh I do it for my hood 
 I said I do it for my hood 
 I'm selling cocaine in the streets like groceries 
 Except it's not groceries 
 It's cocaine 
 I never have sex with a condom on 
 'Cause I wanna repopulate my city 
 My city 
 My hood 
 Repopulate my hood 
 Repopulate my hood 
 Repopulate my hood 
 I do it for my city 
 I do it for my hood 
 I do it for my city 
 I do it for my hood 
 I do it for my cat 
 I do it for my dog 
 I do it for my bird 
 I do it for my fish
