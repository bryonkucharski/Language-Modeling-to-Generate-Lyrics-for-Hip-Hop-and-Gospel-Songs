It's gon' get nasty 
 ...Yes 
 Meme machine 
 Meme machine 
 I'm a motherfucking meme machine 
 Meme machine 
 Meme machine 
 Without memes, I will die 
 Give me the memes 
 I need the memes 
 I smell the memes 
 I need all the memes, the memes to survive 
 I need the memes 
 I breathe the memes 
 I smell the memes 
 I need all the memes, the memes to survive 
 They call me the meme machine 
 I catch the memes, I spread the memes 
 I eat the memes, I shit the memes 
 Without memes, I will die 
 Inhale the memes 
 Exhale the memes 
 Inject the memes into my bloodstream 
 There are good memes, and there are bad memes 
 Why has God abandoned us? (help me) 
 Smoke the memes, snort the memes 
 Take the memes until you OD 
 If you borrowed my memes then you owe me 
 A new fresh pair of memes 
 Meme machine 
 Meme machine 
 I'm a motherfucking meme machine 
 Meme machine 
 Meme machine 
 Without memes, I will die 
 Give me the memes 
 I need the memes 
 I smell the memes 
 I need all the memes, the memes to survive 
 I need the memes 
 I breathe the memes 
 I smell the memes 
 I need all the memes, the memes to survive
