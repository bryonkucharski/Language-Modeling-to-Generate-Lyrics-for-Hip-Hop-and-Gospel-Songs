Aw yeah, Frank is back 
 Oh, my favorite part of the day 
 You got a friend in me, yeah 
 You got a friend in me 
 (Oh man, I'm so glad he's back) 
 When the road looks rough ahead 
 (Oh yeah) 
 And you're miles and miles from your nice warm bed 
 (Wait, what the fuck? Is this kid masturbating?) 
 You just remember what your old pal said 
 (Oh, that is fucking morbid, that is so disgusting) 
 'Cause you've got a friend in me (Kill me) 
 Yeah, you've got a friend in me (Kill me)
