Go fetus it's not your birthday 
 You're just a fetus so it's not your birthday 
 There's a high chance that you won't have a birthday 
 'Cause your mama's only 16 
 You can find me in the womb 
 Bathing in the fluids 
 It takes you 9 months just to take a huge poo 
 Started with a pussy, now my pussy is a dick 
 It's biology 
 Susceptible disease 
 You can find me in the cervix 
 Coming head first 
 This ain't another c-section 
 This is real birth 
 And I'm a real fetus 
 Coming on this earth 
 So come give me a blanket 
 And a hot towel 
 When you see my head in the pussy coming out 
 I've been eating all this shit my mama chug down 
 So she drank a little booze? So my head is fucked up 
 She smoked a little cigarette? I got a extra thumb 
 My mama's from Chernobyl, so I got an extra head 
 My mama's from China? One child policy 
 My mama's from the ghetto? So she drinks the Hennessy 
 That results with me 
 Getting a c-section 
 My mama had protein, and I get a little bigger 
 In the 1800's you can find me in the river 
 I've been dead for 2 months 
 My only ambition is to suck up some titties 
 So I come out the pussy all smelly and shitty 
 And the doctor slap my ass like I'm in the club strippin' 
 I'm a fetus motherfucker don't you ever be trippin' 
 You can find me in the womb 
 Bathing in the fluids 
 It takes you 9 months just to take a huge poo 
 Started with a pussy, now my pussy is a dick 
 It's biology 
 Susceptible disease 
 You can find me in the cervix 
 Coming head first 
 This ain't another c-section 
 This is real birth 
 And I'm a real fetus 
 Coming on this earth 
 So come give me a blanket 
 And a hot towel 
 Yeah I listen to death metal 
 Because I'm screaming and covered in blood
