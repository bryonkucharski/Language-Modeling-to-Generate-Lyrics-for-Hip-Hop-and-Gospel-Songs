Do you know why you're lonely? 
 It's 'cause you're fat and gay 
 Girls don't choose the nice guys 
 And you're a nice guy! 
 But you're fat 
 And you're fucking gay 
 And why don't girls see the inside? 
 Oh, they do! 
 And they see 
 That you're still fat and gay 
 There's no such thing as the 
 Friendzone, friendzone (Oh-oh) 
 The only reason that you're lonely 
 Is 'cause you're fat and gay 
 There's no such thing as the 
 Friendzone, friendzone (Oh-oh) 
 The only reason that you're lonely 
 Is 'cause you're fat and gay
