If you want to eat some dog 
 I have good news 
 There's an annual dog festival 
 Where you can eat all the dog you want 
 And it's located in Yulin Guangxi China 
 And the festival spans about ten days 
 With 15 thousand dogs consumed 
 And it goes from the 21st to the 30th of June 
 I just wanna let you know 
 I'm just tryna' be a bro 
 So you first take a flight to Guangzhou China 
 Once you get off at that airport 
 You wanna ask around for the Guangxi provincial bus 
 And it costs 20 US dollars 
 And it's a four and a half hour ride 
 And you get off at Maoming West 
 Just remember Maoming West 
 Now you might have to stay there a full night 
 Depending on the time you arrive 
 Because the next bus that goes to Yulin only runs like once a day 
 And you have to buy another ticket 
 It's about another 22 bucks 
 But from there it goes straight to Yulin 
 Soon enough you'll be eating some dog 
 Now there are about 8 available hotels in Yulin 
 I'm checking online now 
 I suggest the Yulin Lijing International Hotel 
 Offering a sauna, fitness center 
 Wow it's not too bad at all 
 Never mind, it's 50 bucks a night 
 But with free complementary breakfast 
 And a free cancellation fee 
 So it's not a bad as I thought 
 When you're ready the concierge will know exactly which festival you're talking about 
 And he or she will give you directions 
 So take a cab 
 But don't get ripped off 
 If you're white they'll charge you double 
 I shit you not 
 I shit you not 
 But anyways enjoy your flight 
 Goodbye 
 Enjoy the dog festival
