I just wanna show my appreciation to how much I love kids 
 And teens between the ages of twelve and seventeen 
 Why, are kids so fucking stupid? 
 Did their parents not beat them hard enough-enough-enough? 
 I try, to empathize with teens 
 Because when I was younger I was stupid too-too-too (It's true) 
 But then I realized, that I was never this stupid 
 My friends were never this stupid, y'all are just dense-dense-dense 
 Like damn, I'm really, really concerned 
 I wish your father would use that wooden spoon-spoon-spoon (Just fucking beat them already) 
 I was being ironic man, what a fucking loser. Do you have- 
 Listen kids, being edgy is okay 
 But the same ten jokes in a row, that's not okay-okay-okay 
 Like damn, is that all you can come up with? 
 If you're gonna be racist at least be original, please (Yeah, we're dead serious) 
 If you're under seventeen, please don't ever talk to me 
 You think this is part of the act, but please don't come near me 
 Dude, get a load of this guy! 
 He's never heard of irony before! What a fucking loser dude! 
 Jimmy it's past your bedtime 
 Dad no 
 It's past your bedtime, get back to bed 
 I was just being ironic 
 I don't care 
 No dad please 
 No, you're being a piece of shit, take these spanks you little bitch 
 Daddy please, daddy please 
 Who do you think you are? who the fuck do you think you are? 
 Talking to people on the internet like you're some piece of shit, calling irony 
 I was just being ironic 
 Take these fucking spanks you dumbass kid. 
 I should've never given birth to you, you piece of shit 
 Take that, I'm out of here son 
 I was being ironic 
 If I should even call you son 
 Daddy, have you ever heard of irony before? 
 I was just kidding, that crying was ironic, I wasn't actually crying 
 What the fuck did you just say? You want me to come back here? Huh? 
 Nothing daddy 
 That's what I fucking thought, go back to bed, it's nine PM
