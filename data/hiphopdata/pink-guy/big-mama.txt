Big mama, selling narcota 
 How much do it cost bitch? None, zip, nada 
 Run from policia, ain't no drama 
 Fresh new Adidas for the newborn stamina 
 Flow so pretty I would turn around and fuck it 
 Asian girl screams, that's the Bangkok Ruckus 
 Not a crack-pipe, but I crack pipe vocally 
 Pipe kids down with the black cane locally 
 Got a thick layer of bullshit that covers me 
 Spying on your girl from a tree like Discovery Channel 
 Bust through your girl's vag canal 
 Fuck her in the ass, less humps than a camel 
 Yo, riddle this fictitious little kiddo 
 That rinses dishes 
 Blow kisses to bad girls they flinch itches 
 Mad sketchy like Craigslist, ain't shit 
 Y'all finish short, like a midget at the races 
 When I'm on the beat, I'm something like a cipher 
 Podium possess kid, keep it old school, like a type writer 
 Night-rides a horse, so I'm a knight rider 
 Something like a king bombing on these Al-Quaders 
 Bitch! 
 No, I'm just scanning a thin line 
 Between a piece of shit and a battle of ill minds 
 I got dumb people that be testing my rhymes 
 But I can bend around the process and steadily incline 
 So when they ask, "Who am I?" 
 Make a death slow, and they feel the pain 
 And when I'm not on my pill, my brain deteriorates and I go insane
