Ayo, A-Mine 
 Animé 
 Anemone 
 Amani for one 
 Animé, right? 
 Ayo Amen, ay you make music, innit? 
 Don't you have that one song that's on YouTube? It's like... 
 Aminaminah 
 Amino, right? 
 Something, I don't know... 
 I Aminé no harm 
 Nah? Oh... oh... my bad 
 Respect, that's all I ask for 
 My fin is fear too 
 No you ain't stone cold 
 I know you bleed too 
 Head up in the clouds 
 My feet to the crowd 
 I hate all your friends 
 But y'all splittin' rent 
 So every night I'm over 
 I try to find some closure 
 But you open your jaws 
 And then I'm goin' raw 
 I wanna throw my hands up high 
 And forget who I used to be 
 I wanna throw my hands up high 
 And get a taste of your luxury 
 You don't wanna cry tears with me (tears) 
 You just wanna keep sighin' (sighin') 
 Sometimes I wonder if you're bad for me (you're bad) 
 But that's what keeps me excited 
 When I'm with you 
 You're my hero 
 And my heroin 
 I'm addicted 
 Ms. Excellent (ay) 
 You're my hero (hero) 
 And my heroin (yuh) 
 Oh you're perfect (I love it) 
 But you're bad for me 
 She gave me her ID 
 Couldn't read the date (date) 
 I hate all your hiding 
 Plus I gotta pay (pay) 
 Tastes like smoke but her lungs never choke (no) 
 Oh heart, brain freeze, oh I like her, baby 
 I hate you (uh) but I love you 
 I always pay you (yeah) but I owe you (true) 
 I mean I CashApp to you, I Venmo too (hey) 
 My savings ain't been saving so let's IOU (woo) 
 I paid for dinner and dessert (I did) 
 Keep my attention on your eyes (I did) 
 Open my heart and open doors (school) 
 But respect seems to lack from you 
 I wanna throw my hands up high 
 And forget who I used to be 
 I wanna throw my hands up high 
 And get a taste of your luxury 
 You don't wanna cry tears with me (tears) 
 You just wanna keep sighin' (sighin') 
 Sometimes I wonder if you're bad for me (you're bad) 
 But that's what keeps me excited 
 When I'm with you 
 You're my hero 
 And my heroin 
 I'm addicted 
 Ms. Excellent (ay) 
 You're my hero (hero) 
 And my heroin (yuh) 
 Oh you're perfect (I love it) 
 But you're bad for me
