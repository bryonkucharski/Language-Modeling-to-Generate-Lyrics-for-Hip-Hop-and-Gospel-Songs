Ay man, say man 
 We starting to get really tired all that, all that hoopty hollering 
 Whoopty whoo, blaze blah y'all been talking lately, man 
 Go somewhere with all that, man, for real, shut up, shut up 
 All that talking y'all been doing man, for real 
 "I'ma do this, I'ma do that," ugh 
 Every day you're talking, every day you're in my ears 
 And every time we fighting, I gotta go and wipe your tears 
 'Cause if I don't do, you gon' throw your problems on me 
 And then we'll fuss and fight when I just really wish you'd... 
 Shut the fuck up, don't complicate it 
 Shut the fuck up, you're overexaggerating 
 Shut the fuck up, you'll have some patience 
 Shut the fuck up, quit giving me hell 
 We keep locking eyes, petty so you're silent 
 You keep talking signs, heart is in the science 
 Sleep, weep, don't cry on me, don't die on me 
 All up in my face with the oochie wally wally 
 Sounding like girls at a party on the molly 
 I ain't tryna link or build 
 Bubble space, bubble space, still, nigga, chill (Move) 
 Oh, you got a chain? Sick 
 Oh, you got some fame? Sick 
 Got a new Rolex and you knew he had to flex 
 'Cause the hoes gon' check 
 500K in my stash 
 Why you flex the only couple hundreds that you have? 
 Screw needing security for your insecurity 
 Calling niggas broke, you should choke on your own words 
 Name dropping, pick cropping, dick hopping, bill dodging 
 Boy, you know who you are 
 Man, why you wanna try so hard? 
 Be yourself, be yourself and please 
 Shut the fuck up, don't complicate it 
 Shut the fuck up, you're overexaggerating 
 Shut the fuck up, you'll have some patience 
 Shut the fuck up, get out my head 
 I'm waiting my whole life, but I'm tired, tired of wishing for you 
 I'm waiting patiently, but my mischief wishing for something new 
 Money come right back, never had to fight that 
 But I come back, back 
 Thought it was a night cap, life hit a hijack 
 Girl, let's be face, face 
 Heartbreak Drake for my first heartbreak 
 I was 17 and I made mistakes 
 Went to dances but I never did dance 
 Got pretty fly, but I never did pan 
 Now I'm 23, loving and learning from all the lovers that I see 
 Nissan babes with the body burgundy 
 Love my car same way I used to love key 
 Friends need a Uber, sis need tuition 
 Fans want the music, but they want a politician 
 Pressure, pressure, pressure, pressure, pressure 
 Shut the fuck up, I don't need the extras 
 Spice girls sitting in the red Mercedes 
 Attitude like I'm tryna have your babies 
 But I ain't tryna have no babies, no, I ain't tryna have no baby 
 Been waiting my whole life, but I'm tired, tired of wishing for you 
 I'm waiting patiently, but my mischief wishing for something new
