Yah-yah, yah-yah 
 Yah-yah, yah-yah 
 Woah 
 Yah-yah, yah-yah 
 Yah-yah, yah-yah 
 I woke up on this Sunday 
 With no motivation in my body, no-woah-woah 
 Phone drier than Mojave 
 Daddy diabetic, so he eat his pancakes with agave 
 Mamma headed to the church now 
 And she left me at the house, she left me at the house 
 Religious, but I'm lazy 
 Naked like a nudist, Fruity Loops and Stanley Kubrick 
 Peanut butter jelly, cousin bumping Makaveli 
 Sipping Stellas with my fellas 
 Bumping nothing but Fela Kuti 
 Groupies say they wanna do me 
 Truly, that feel like a blessing 
 But finding one to love is getting harder every second 
 Niggas would rather be single than see a wedding date 
 Niggas will either end up in Heaven or at Kevin's gates 
 I bench-press my problems like add another weight 
 And act like it's alright when it's not, woah 
 Some days we get Sundays, but most days the rain comes down 
 And I feel like I'm bound to drown 
 Jesus Christ, woah 
 Truth is my religion, my beliefs, and I'm forgiven 
 Some days we get Sundays, but most days the rain comes down 
 And I feel like I'm bound to drown 
 Jesus Christ, woah 
 Truth is my religion, my beliefs, and I'm forgiven 
 I've been sipping red wine since a toddler 
 Blood of Christ, sacrifice for my Father 
 My daddy love me and hate me like Mr. Focker 
 My sister happy that I can afford Supreme 
 Mama called, she said 
 "Don't worry 'bout me baby, get your problems solved" 
 I told her, "Ask me for whatever, whenever you want 
 I just went double platinum" 
 Mama say my health is more important than my album 
 I'm not loud, I'm Ethiopian rowdy 
 Send my parents to Maui, now they skin look like a brownie 
 Yo-Yo see me grind, Dimitrius say he proud 
 My niggas lift me up, whenever I'm 'bout to drown 
 Fuck a Monday, I love my Sundays 
 I head to Costco, and get a smoothie 
 Mama say count your blessings 
 So I did, and now I realize who I am and who I'm not, woah 
 Some days we get Sundays, but most days the rain comes down 
 And I feel like I'm bound to drown 
 Jesus Christ, woah 
 Truth is my religion, my beliefs, and I'm forgiven 
 Some days we get Sundays, but most days the rain comes down 
 And I feel like I'm bound to drown 
 Jesus Christ, woah 
 Truth is my religion, my beliefs, and I'm forgiven 
 Woah 
 Sunday 
 Don't let him die 
 Don't let him die 
 Don't let him die 
 Don't let him die
