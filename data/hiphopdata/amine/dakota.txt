 Baby girl, I've had one too many 
 My cup ain't full, but it's got me empty 
 Only drink to mingle 'cause I'm single 
 Waiter, can you break this 20? 
 I'm not about the flashiness, I'm only about you and this 
 Drink that's in my hand, it's got this playing 
 And it's got me wasted, got me faded

 I wanna make you feel young (Feel young) 
 I wanna make you feel something (Feel something) 
 I wanna make you feel young (Feel young) 
 I wanna make you feel something 
 You know I wanna make you feel, I wanna make you feel 
 I wanna make you feel, I wanna make you feel 
 I wanna make, I wanna make 
 I wanna make, I wanna make you feel

 It's funny how I always find myself in Dakota 
 Knocking on my conscious every morning like Jehovah 
 I'm afraid of heights but my feelings roller coaster 
 So I'ma chug, chug 
 I'd like to pay the tab if you let me make a statement 
 But then she tell me "No" the same way they did David 
 Cabernet for my fitness sake 
 My confidence a raisin but I wish it was a grape 
 Holes in my soul 'cause I feel like Zero 
 Patch me up quick with a stitch like Lilo 
 Red wine like my red coupe, white girls want the proof 
 Jay Rock to a Kate Moss, get out 
 Fingers on the edge of my glass, making it last 
 Thinking about a girl from Portland, I'm in my past 
 Got groupies fanning out like Dakota 
 But I rather get shy on my sofa

 Compassion ain't a man's best friend 
 But it's somewhere next to his pride 
 Illuminate the bullshit and give him some time 
 Aminé 
 Gazing at the bottom of my glass 
 Searching for an answer to mistakes from my past 
 I ain't been to Saturn and I ain't been to Mars 
 I haven't met Elon but I have met a star 
 It's hard to relish how I really feel about you 
 Like my niggas, my feelings is really, really out here 
 I cry with my hands up high 
 Just so I can get by when I truly feel alone 
 I see the fire in your eyes 
 I wonder if this is real or if I'm underwater 
 Dark nights, light hearts, cold face 
 It makes you want to see what we could have become 
 But everything's meant to be
