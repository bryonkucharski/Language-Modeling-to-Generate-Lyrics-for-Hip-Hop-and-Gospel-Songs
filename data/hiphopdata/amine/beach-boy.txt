I don't wanna plan, I just wanna dance (yeah) 
 Fuck a fortune teller, they can't tell me who I am 
 I'm a yellow mellow fellow and my cousin is the sun 
 I'm Aminé to my niggas and Animé to a punk (hey) 
 When I give her Jimmy, then my baby give me Neutron 
 Verses I be shoppin', you can bet I got them deals (shit) 
 I could die tomorrow, so my future got some pressure 
 Pay tuition for my sis and cop my mom a Tesla 
 Old me is stuck in the new one 
 Red pill cause don't take the blue one 
 Wonderland doesn't seem too bad 
 I think I'm gonna wallow in tomorrow like yeah 
 Who knows what the future holds? 
 I don't, if the truth be told 
 They say play it safe, young soul 
 Fuck that, Imma take control 
 I was dead until I sought out (yeah) 
 Took my time and then I found out (true) 
 Got some tears, they made me ball out 
 Took my fears, and threw 'em all out (all out) 
 Patient, I don't ever chase it 
 If I need some time, I'ma stretch it like it's latex 
 Jesus take the wheel, I need David Copperfield 
 Parallel to parasails, I'm Aminé McFly 
 Better ask Moana, flexin' like I'm Maui (true) 
 I don't care what people think, I'm perfect in my psyche 
 Sike! Bitch, I'm not, I'm just insecure as most 
 Life could change in a blink, don't know what the future holds 
 Old me is stuck in the new one 
 Red pill 'cause don't take the blue one 
 Wonderland doesn't seem too bad 
 I think I'm gonna wallow in tomorrow like yeah 
 Who knows what the future holds? 
 I don't, if the truth be told 
 They say play it safe, young soul 
 Fuck that, I'ma take control 
 I was dead until I sought out (yeah) 
 Took my time and then I found out (true) 
 Got some tears, they made me ball out 
 Took my fears, and threw 'em all out (all out) 
 All out, I'm goin' all out 
 If you try to stop me you can bet I'm goin' all out 
 Runnin' up the numbers 'cause I can and I want to 
 This your favorite song, you gon' sing it till it's past due 
 All out, I'm goin' all out 
 This your favorite song, you gon' sing it till I ball out 
 Bitch I'm in the clouds 
 Runnin' in a trance, got you runnin' 
 I don't know when I'm gonna die 
 My watch can't tell the time 
 Hopefully there's some hope in me 
 I won't trip if it's meant to be 
 I don't know when I'm gonna die 
 My watch can't tell the time 
 Hopefully there's some hope in me 
 I won't trip if it's meant to be 
 I don't know when I'm gonna die 
 Hopefully there's hope in me 
 I don't know when I'm gonna die 
 Hopefully there's hope in me
