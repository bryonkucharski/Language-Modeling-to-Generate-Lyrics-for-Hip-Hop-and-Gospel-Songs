Every day I'm counting up my paper 
 Petty niggas hate, the ones in public with the vapors 
 Leave 'em in the dust and then we tell 'em see you later 
 Only people that truly know me is my mama and my maker 
 Shawty, you like my free form dreads 
 I love it when she give a nigga free form head 
 It's the banana boy, favorite color you know 
 Yellow is the new black, and I'm Mr. Caputo 
 Close the blinds 
 I want to see me shine 
 Don't want to hear you chime 
 I want to see me glisten 
 Close the blinds 
 I want to see me shine 
 Don't want to hear you chime 
 I want to see me glisten 
 Dreads like Bob Marley 
 Hardly ever call these hoes, I'm too gnarly 
 Look like George Forman, couldn't afford Jordan's 
 Talk to informant, never, I'm important 
 Maybe I might die 
 Baby girl, I'm the cream of the crop 
 Creme de la creme, got the juice so they jock 
 Women in my city treat a nigga like I'm Diddy 
 Pimpin' ain't a thang, I'm independent with my lane 
 Aminé very fly, Aminé don't even try 
 He raps and then he dips, he never singin' for no tricks 
 Turn on your TV, then you might see me 
 Aminé don't give a fuck because I know that I'm the shit
