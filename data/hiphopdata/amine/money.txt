Yah-yah, yah-yah, yah, yah 
 Yah-yah, yah-yah, yah, yah 
 Whoa, hey 
 Everyday I wake up 
 Gotta get this cake up 
 Lookin' at my life like 
 Is this what it's made of? (made of) 
 Money rule the world around me 
 That's why it's on my mind 
 Everyday I wake up 
 Gotta get this cake up 
 Lookin' at my life like 
 Is this what it's made of? (made of) 
 Money rule the world around me 
 And now I realize... 
 Money make the world go 'round 
 Money turn your best friend down 
 Money turn a good girl out 
 Money make the sun go South 
 And it make my self-esteem 
 But it never take my dream life 
 Money make the world go 'round 
 Money turn your best friend down 
 Money turn a good girl out 
 Money make the sun go South 
 And it make my self-esteem 
 But it never take my dream life 
 Tender love and care, I see the money with my left eye 
 Rubber band man like my nickname T.I 
 Labels wanna sign but the money so eh 
 And the contract iffy so Brooklyn tell 'em see ya 
 I'm most loyal to the most loyal 
 You can't find dirt on me 'cause I'm not soil 
 I wouldn't do much for money man (yeah) 
 Aminé ain't your wonder man 
 Now they all, women makin' calls 
 Like "Aminé, do you got that paper? Let me hold it" 
 Mama need a whip and my daddy need a crib 
 Got a phone, lil nigga, why the fuck I need a Rollie? 
 Black pepper chicken and chow mein, my favorite 
 Sayin' you ain't racist really sound racist 
 See money give a nigga rings 
 Then when you get it everybody call you fake 
 'Cause when it all boils down 
 Everything's a riddle 
 Everything's fickle 
 There's no satisfaction 
 There's no satisfaction 
 'Cause when it all boils down 
 Everything's fickle 
 And little 
 There's no satisfaction 
 There's no 
 Every day I wake up 
 Gotta get this cake up 
 Lookin' at my life like, is this what it's made of? (Made of) 
 Money rule the world around me 
 That's why it's on my mind 
 Every day I wake up 
 Gotta get this cake up 
 Lookin' at my life like, is this what it's made of? (Made of) 
 Money rule the world around me 
 And now I realize 
 Money make the world go 'round 
 Money turn your best friend down 
 Money turn a good girl out 
 Money make the sun go South 
 And it make my self-esteem 
 But it never take my dream life 
 Money make the world go 'round 
 Money turn your best friend down 
 Money turn a good girl out 
 Money make the sun go South 
 And it make my self-esteem 
 But it never take my dream life 
 My city never thought it'd make a nigga like me 
 Young lil' nigga from the 503 
 I'm Tom Cruise, the rap game the couch from Oprah 
 I'm here for my range, boy, not them Rovers 
 Money make my world go 'round 
 Money make my heartbeat pounce 
 Ask God for a lot 
 Success ain't 'bout the fame and how much jewels you rock 
 Success is when I can tell my momma to quit her job 
 Still poppin' Pellegrino cause my momma like my hero 
 Now hoes give me head 'cause I make banana bread 
 Young black boy, me, I were so rude 
 Give me 40 acres with a Moscow Mule 
 My Señorita boricua 
 She smoke a lot of the reefer 
 I need me commas on commas if rappers want him on feature 
 I'm making Swiss beats so I beat it like an Alicia 
 Money don't make you happy, it just makes you wanna get richer 
 'Cause when it all boils down 
 The paper bring me pleasure 
 There's no satisfaction 
 There's no satisfaction 
 There's nothing you can do to give me 
 What I really need (There's no satisfaction) 
 What I really need 
 Money make the world go 'round 
 Money turn your best friend down 
 Money turn a good girl out 
 Money make the sun go South 
 And it make my self-esteem 
 But it never take my dream life
