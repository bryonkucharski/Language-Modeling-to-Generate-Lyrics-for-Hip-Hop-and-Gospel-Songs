Aminé 
 Walking on the pavement I check my pride and my teeth on 
 The girl I grew up with lives a couple houses down 
 The 8 Bus run the same, dogs howl when the train 
 Comes like me ex girl and next girl 
 Used to rock the S curl 
 Wanted me a Nextel but my momma copped a Razr 
 That's why I couldn't blame her 
 Flipping through my past like I used to flip the phone 
 They kicking out the blacks and all the houses getting clones 
 Friends used to do pills and only eat at Du's Grill 
 The food was pretty good but the times was better 
 These are the only days I missed 
 Like the first shawty I kissed 
 I used to have dreams now I dream 
 I look around and I see nothing in my neighborhood 
 Not satisfied don't think I ever wanna stay for good 
 Packed up my bags, told mom and dad I gotta go, go 
 And once I do they'll finally see the inner me 
 Everybody wanna be a star, everybody want a nice car 
 Everybody wanna live great, have a good damn time, never trip with the law 
 The popo up in PO, dirtier than VO 
 Bullies from the past act like I'm they fucking hero 
 Living in LA for the weather, I facetime mom when I miss her 
 I got some homies that'll never leave my home 
 When I pull up to the corner, it smell like Miley Cyrus 
 I told 'em I don't smoke, they say "boy, you fucking wildin'" 
 Innocent and young, reckless and we dumb 
 Our heart is like our earth and memories the sun 
 I look around and I see nothing in my neighborhood 
 Not satisfied don't think I ever wanna stay for good 
 Packed up my bags, told mom and dad I gotta go, go 
 And once I do they'll finally see the inner me 
 Mentality the same from my folks 
 Momma wanna see me happy, she don't wanna see me broke 
 I said "bread wine, sauvignon, rastafari, babylon" 
 You can never die if I live it like a prize (hey!) 
 Who knows who I am, who knows who I are 
 Most people pretty sketch like a night at Echo Park 
 That's why I just keep it cool but my time is in a leisure 
 Every time I'm home I catch emotion like a seizure 
 I cut the first night, we fuck around, I put my finger in her bootyhole cause you know you gotta test the water with hoes. A-a-and then... 
 I slip and slide through the times in my youth 
 What's the age? Too young to worry, too old to dream 
 What's the age? Imagination to me, tragedy to some 
 What's the age? I guess we'll find out when we're older. Touché 
 I look around and I see nothing in my neighborhood 
 Not satisfied don't think I ever wanna stay for good 
 Packed up my bags, told mom and dad I gotta go, go 
 And once I do they'll finally see the inner me 
 Oh 
 Ooh, oh, ooh, oh yeah 
 Ooh, ooh, oh yeah, ooh 
 Yeah-eah-eah-eah-eah 
 Ooh yeah-eah-eah-eah 
 Oh hmm 
 Oh hmm 
 Hmm 
 Hmm
