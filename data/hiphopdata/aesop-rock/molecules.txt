(That's impossible) 
 (Come on) 
 Spoilers 
 The non bon-voyage stock weaponry and soylents 
 And whatever stopped the voices 
 Colossal paranoia's out to author an abrasive law 
 About how warpaint won't assure you ain't a painted whore, baby 
 No ground wires, all jaw froth 
 Mouth breathing outliers climb outta mothballs 
 Wrung stones unsung and alone 
 Known to run up in the unknown "Honey I'm home!" 
 I push a bucket of bolts, a sort of death in his wake 
 I take the hand off the thief, I take the head off a snake 
 Approach a pen like revolution's just a sentence away 
 Till then he's documenting cops and watching heaven decay 
 It's not a gentleman's game it's a generation raised accordingly 
 You'll know the differences between the cozy and the quarantine 
 Yes y'all the crest fallen care warn 
 Ear horn, heir whorin', heir whorin', air horn 
 These awful winds 
 Those grinding gears 
 This pile o' bones 
 That's why I'm here 
 Wild frontier 
 (Come on) 
 These violent drums 
 Those primal fears 
 This pool of mud 
 That's why I'm here 
 W-w-w-w-wild frontier 
 That's impossible, body's still warm 
 Scavengers already obsessively knocking on his molecules 
 I'm catatonic fat and outta rocket fuel and ramen 
 Not a dollar watching Rocky II in Donatello boxers 
 At some hot as hell motel in what's supposed to be his Shangri La 
 More akin of angry mobs with anchor tats and mangy dogs in vacant lots 
 Traded any semblance of consistency to play the odds 
 Not even a baby doll to change his gauze 
 Not even a hide-away to hide up in 
 A side effect of sliding environment to environment 
 Driving isn't simply when the tires spin, try again 
 Departures and arrivals aren't only time in mileage 
 Try again again a raider break off from the phalanx 
 And never look back never cook crack K thanks bye 
 New York in the rear view then peel... 
 Out, till he found New York in the windshield 
 These cursed dogs 
 Those flying spears 
 This rancid food 
 That's why I'm here 
 Wild frontier 
 (Come on) 
 These fleeting hopes 
 Those vital prayers 
 This bag of cash 
 That's why I'm here 
 W-w-w-w-wild frontier 
 This was never an effective way to rally insurgents 
 Or really even the occupation of a rational person 
 When you write about seclusion and some buyers finally tune in 
 You get frightened finding happiness can drive away the movement 
 In a jiffy, just eat your food and keep the future iffy 
 That fruition's for the viewers who need a loser to pity 
 Plus an underlying message of a greater disconnection 
 God forbid he try to live or gain momentum 
 Mend or pay his penance 
 You'd rather see him eat a bowl of mouse traps 
 Surf a thousand couches 
 Take a jagged little down the hatch 
 Chowder heads 
 I know you love the way the failure flounder 
 Maybe I could be your daily downer 
 If his brain left his body and was headed for the door 
 Would you take it and then help it find its way into a jar? 
 No? fuck it, let him hop around a maze 
 We can see who's really lost when the schadenfreude fades 
 These churning seas 
 Those quiet sneers 
 This box of parts 
 That's why I'm here 
 Wild frontier 
 (Come on) 
 These creepy friends 
 Those dicey dares 
 This perfect dark 
 That's why I'm here 
 W-w-w-w wild frontier
