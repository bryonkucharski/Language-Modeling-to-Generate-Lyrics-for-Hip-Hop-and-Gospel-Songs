(Intro - Unknown man) 
 Thou mayest indeed 
 Tune onto the forbidden channel 
 And see it like it is baby 
 *Record Scratch in* 
 You should be a champion 
 Never fall on me 
 Deceit, deceit, deceit 
 *Record Scratch out* 
 "Getting dusty in the cellar" 
 (Verse 1 - Aesop Rock) 
 Yo 
 I was thinking about my sick friend 
 Stringing a ring around my whit's end 
 13 loops later his feet hung inches out the pig pen 
 Motley day goblins brought up pillage to pass the stillness 
 With bad javelin tip dipped inside barrel black magic brilliance 
 Who rose at the tomb of the Unknown Soldier? 
 To capture the fashion fragment choreographed in traffic dancing for nickels 
 Hooked like sickle cells with the principles of comradery 
 One hope distortion odyssey sputters itself to my how not example sample 
 Give me the bread crust while considering the littering 
 I don't pity the head rush or the whimpering, spill 
 Anchor to rock bottom, rocks bottom packs a ravenous catalyst 
 Sprung alacrative, leashed by the carnal tyrant 
 I choked when the cage bird sings and stings 
 Springs me up delirium to stitch the clipped wings 
 I say instinctively break through while clinging the shrieking souls 
 Mourning the death of full and high to loss of quality control 
 Quality control, stand still string up the banner 
 From the beehive to the anthill; rag dummy 
 Incorporate the unison of Vikings ship rowers plus the perfection 
 Of the twice to burn with half the stone throwers, speak your assessment 
 My communicative, hindrance bleeds the needs 
 Of a billion hungry victims gripped by the hell that's left to splinters 
 Shiving up the mass of natives and it's league marvels 
 One component's sure to shock a mass burial, breeze 
 Broken penny bank fragments float up at stagnant seas 
 Dirty work plus applicants with chatter box disease 
 Iron bandit, give them the stars, the head balloons and rubies 
 Asked for many moons and I can't stand it any more 
 (Unknown man) 
 This is how I feel that I sling 
 And the regulars were so amazed 
 *Record Scratch in* 
 I'm the mightiest slinger of them all! 
 There is a time for war and a time for peace 
 And a time to run and a time to split 
 *Record Scratch out* 
 "Getting dusty in the cellar" 
 (Verse 2 - Aesop Rock) 
 I don't run a funny race, malnourished monarchs and loopy astrals 
 Where 99.9% swivel the broken axels 
 I built boats of a pack rat bats of bully club swung 
 Post utility inhalants nail it to stability and sail it 
 Lopsided Star bird bow crooked mass makeshift 
 Patching holes with chewing gum and stitching sail to thirty phases 
 Observe me sitting with my eyes tied to the clock, 'Cause 
 I know that once that wind kicks up you and your motors left rope to the dock 
 And it's the, art of clarity married to slender extension 
 Of blue sky of a happy neighborhood 
 String on my ring has left me dancing like wooden dummies in a paper nature 
 Marry had a case of door nails, Francis little brittle dolls of paper 
 In assembly, I tremble with a crocodile smile 
 Hiding a fish out of water complex provided upon entry 
 Now if I, were to, hold the speed 
 To levigate the game plan, would you wanna still impede 
 I mean I guess, I can just divorce me from the rest 
 And blame my chemical imbalance for the fact I've made a mess 
 But my loyalty supply hints ??? 
 And I'm thinking that damn town prior's about to fill this here bucket 
 It's that, grand precious that precious that part of you wants to touch 
 And part of you just wants to sit and be impressed with 
 Tainted agony induct in barnacle attachments 
 Mood swinging upon the barnstorm to perpendicular traffic 
 Spread, circle 4,000 circuits you burn to cater wings 
 Above alkadiene Townsman spoon-fed the shadow 
 I'm tired of being wired into the thief ratio 
 It's gnawing a hole through my scheme so I leave (know what I mean?) 
 (Outro - Unknown man) 
 It is the molotov cocktail hour 
 Have I not brought you blessings without number? 
 *Record Scratch in* 
 They have plenty of nothing and nothing is plenty for them 
 Yeah 
 I've never had it so good 
 *Record Scratch out*
