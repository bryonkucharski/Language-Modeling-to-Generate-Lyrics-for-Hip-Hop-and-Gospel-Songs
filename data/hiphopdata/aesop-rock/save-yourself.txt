Pull the pin out, sheep creep in wolf garb 
 Fronted by the Hail Mary parry lunge mixer 
 Kill the populace for civility, jeopardy's a stickler 
 Its bob and weave amalgam played the falcon to your fixture 
 I branch out, arms flailing backwards 
 Wailin upon a tidy sound circuit 
 Slightly foul Gershwin 
 With a bed of nails and drumlust plus disgusted service 
 Workin in shifts opposite the asbestos brain furnace 
 I be the now observatory eye ear antenna feeler 
 Spittin' like a dragon with a similar demeanor 
 Stood innocent bystand witness the diehard fans turn Rip Van 
 In the poppy fields of N.Y.'s orchestrated brick gauntlet 
 Now I'm thinkin' who am I Jabberwocky Superfly bent left 
 Pushin war without the ten step cushion and what (what) 
 I plan to hold this B-positive sacred in these golden veins 
 Until the day I die from grimace overload 
 It's shock (it's shock) 
 Treatment offered by the weekend 
 This still be a getaway, let's display the sequence it goes: 
 One for the heartless thievery turning my guardian angel harpless 
 And the rest to sweep the mess under the carpet (under the carpet) 
 I drag a yellow taxi meter behind every measure 
 And charge cats for labeling me shepherd 
 "That'll be Six Fifty plus tip darlin', 
 I take cash, credit, check, money-order, gold and cigarette cartons" 
 Huh, got caught up in the universe tryin' to zoom in on stardom 
 Forgot the passion plus the hatred, both were based in Carbon 
 Next time you wanna be a hero try saving somethin' other than hip-hop 
 And maybe hip-hop'll save you from the pit-stop 
 Kill 'em all, yeah 
 (Naw man It wasn't me it was Holden Caulfield brother 
 I just read and pulled the trigger) 
 Oh God, well leave me to tiptoe past the pearly gates 
 Capture the halo, jet back to base, step past the chase 
 The bad taste of jet-lag and weight slackers 
 There ain't nothin' broken, where you at? 
 The pistons pump perfect, where you at? 
 The bass tone is Merlin, where you at? 
 This service is a urgent workin surgeons 
 Purging formulas lookin' for an improper cause is whack 
 What are you saving, honestly? (honestly, honestly) 
 What are you saving, honestly? (honestly, no honestly) 
 What are you saving, honestly? (damn) 
 Promise me you gon shut the fuck up and recognize 
 What you holdin' ain't really broken? 
 I don't flick needles like my sick friend (friend) 
 I don't march like Beetle Bailey through a quick trend (trend) 
 I don't frequent church's steeples on my weekend (end) 
 And I don't comment if you formulate a weak Zen. 
 All I ever really wanted was a getaway 
 I'ma take a chance by letting a brook slide for what I got in my hands 
 I can not agree to follow a leader while on the borderline 
 A war without a reason for the Brady hates gore 
 Bring out your dead we can put 'em in a pile 
 And burn 'em with the novels for the kids then to admire 
 Kill the ones that speak from a different life 
 Brewin other killer noise makin' the sentiment... 
 Okay, welcome to the Kamikaze bottle rocket cockpit 
 Live by the icy cold hand of bad intention youth blender 
 Oh yeah I'll let God warm the bench for now but 
 I'll ascend to spin y'all dizzy 
 (And for the record I'm bringin' my TV with me) 
 Yo, let the commoners speak publicly 
 Then disperse eye jammies for cats that swear by third pupil 
 But can't see past the loophole 
 Motherfucker, my word is born like Siamese triplets 
 With doctor, lawyer, rocket scientist promise 
 (Let 'em grow leisurely) 
 Hey Mom, I'ma fix whatev I broke along this path 
 Once my spiel's perfected I'ma save you a seat in the front row 
 Of Aesop Rock's twelve steps to shut the fuck up seminar 
 And when all these bickering crowds turn solid you gon be proud 
 I tack hacks to the (backboard) 
 Honesty's a (latchcord) 
 Fury's far from (obsolete) 
 Serenity's a crack whore 
 Raw caricature of mayhem standard branded by the labor 
 With a thousand reasons to end this for every one of you saviors 
 Saw the brightest burst ironically wide from the vacant stage 
 Gave it a pound for burning where bunk ratio's engaged 
 Keep me posted as to when you grasp something mature to 
 Sit and sulk about mister, and I'll consider pickin' up your record 
 The Authors, they ain't got nothin' to save 
 The Overground, man they ain't got nothin' to save 
 Def Jux, they ain't got nothin' to save 
 The Addams Family, they ain't got nothin' to save 
 Weightless, they ain't got nothin' to save 
 Stronghold man, they ain't got nothin' to save 
 Rhymesayers baby, they ain't got nothin' to save 
 Aesop Rock, I ain't got nothin' to save 
 It's like that
