Yeah 
 Yeah NASA let's try this 
 Park your bets, sharks or jets 
 These bark mark targets where the barnacles nest 
 They burrow deep under the carnivores flesh without a trace, 
 Carnival games, like try to shoot the star out of a space 
 Come double fist them awkward gats lockbox your passin' 
 Spoon up the ballooning for high noon saloony antics 
 Walk off with a thumbs up and a stuffed Bullwinkle trinket 
 Pull twinkle out them awestruck baby sockets for a day (yeah, that's the ticket) 
 Yeah, that's the pipe dream that hater 101 bitch picks 
 Living guilt trips for the fan-based family picnics 
 Whose handshake carry with it 
 Y'all inspire me, it's an honor to meet you 
 Now its randomly fantasy beef stew, that's panicky preschool 
 That's peak re-signed Pikachu when he's pokin' Pinocchi beezer 
 Where Big Brother watch me, holler back Wally Cleaver 
 Knobby-kneed geezer whose brittle paddleboat sank 
 Wishing he could restitch the images when the kinescope cranked - 
 He couldn't. You can't. 
 I'm more than two lambs with a Mongoloid loyalty clause 
 And a done-did-got-busy ambiance 
 That's Laserface, Megalasaur, Scissor-tongue, Liftedly, Money Murs Ramble, Printmatic, Hanger, Blockhead and Ravipops 
 And the fam only begins with the last two bars he dropped 
 After chrome fangs I'll rewrite Heavy Metal Parking Lot 
 That's why these grapevines can pop shit to me all day, 
 I only kick these fucking doors down and make sure the crew OK, like 
 Food on the plate, pat on the back, kicks on the palette 
 I rock the bells without clown shoes, fried dough, tickets or mallets 
 While the bearded ladies won goldfish from the ping-pong toss challenge 
 Who light girls and misconstrued the lucky fuckloaders for talent 
 It's sad really... ok, I'm over it - 
 Smolder over composure models like 
 Smoke over soldier nostrils 
 3-D bifocal goggle broke over catwalkers 
 There must have been something up in that Long Island tap water 
 Through the mute wind storm the hoover and his frisky sissy poodle pack 
 Oozing that hollow oodle-mac act Ace threw back in junior rap - 
 Isn't it strange how it's a fad to bite your idols when the whole reason you liked em's 'cause their shit wasn't recycled? 
 Caught pigeonhole Aesop like he ain't hurtin', that's no burden 
 Need attention? Better dress them diversions like stripping nurses 
 Kid the cult is thick and media's the sacrificial virgin, 
 Perching little man behind curtain opinions - this is perfect 
 I'm just like y'all, living low-pro to paycheck 
 When the landlord hollers they hid the dro in the tape deck 
 Rocket radio, every success smidgen he harnessed 
 Parks with wrist and sick wit it clickin' in perfect working ratio 
 What risk he added dodge blame game for sneaky plots 
 With elevated rung placement derived from deep rooted jealousy issues 
 They cued a raging bull and every due is paid in full 
 With that I'll forget all you motherfucks that fail to pull 
 Why? well, what's really good? 
 Not a catcher peddled backwards for a hacker's filthy looks 
 Hodge-podge phenomenon, muppets available in rubber stamp form 
 Hogwash Harry clamp norm 
 Wear the space cape baker, order up 
 Herbert's pacemaker and vacate personal space in relation to face breaker 
 Built an Einstein-Rosen bridge to ideate with Lincoln Logs and bobby pins 
 Probably when Ozzy's friends slept on the poppy stems 
 Horseback 60 mph, one hand rollin' tobacky badly 
 But it burns that cavalry of concerned worms for Mayor 
 But you'll find validity in a penny - 
 Right, and I got a clear flick of the Loch Ness sucking off Yeti 
 With a kneejerk response to his budgetary woes 
 Use hooky out the institute since huckleberry molds 
 Styled after the Hermann Rorschach margin mark 
 Starvin' art smash see the slashed martyr hark 
 Trapped in the lap for garter belt 
 This is sick flash Definitive Jux baby 
 We like, 'love it or leave it out your hollerbox now' 
 Cripple a kitten if a kitten is a culprit 
 You're spillin insignificant frijoles
