Well, so we meet again 
 (He said he's grown spiritually since the last time) 
 Ok, this is the dawning of the book of bitter aspects 
 Where the jackals sit and watch the pedigods last flesh 
 Poison functions accompanied by six armorclad 
 Black horse and buggy mechanism 
 Tucked the portion of my severed vision 
 The gathering of loose ends in a bucket 
 Wit a shoestring budget 
 Every man's got a field to plow (I know that now) 
 But it's like, man I really can't afford the oxen 
 Fee fie etcetera 
 I smell the warm blood of the bill collector knockin' 
 I get awkwardly sturdy with a frigid liquid backbone 
 I get swept in the pressure cooker tryin' to paddle back home 
 I get sprung with a vibrant alliance of clean intention 
 By eclipsing doom midigons hatched to bash these picket fences 
 Now I'll attend the wedding of the open sore and festering 
 Now when the groom presents the ring 
 The bride commence to blistering 
 This textbook magnificently prude 
 Prototype king beserker module 
 Inserted vertical thirst, burst horizontal 
 Treasure (treasure), loose cannons span the starboard bow of 
 The clippership dipped in truth famine pressure 
 Cabin fever meter pegging ludicrous 
 Beautiful cartoon trooper swallow Buddha futility with a teaspoon full of sugar 
 I rock ready aim fire, when y'all rock ready fire aim 
 Then blame the stationary target while the prey escapes the frame 
 Merit badge marksman, or poacher, it's all the same 
 So I lay across the wood perpendicular to the grain 
 I wanna be a big bang, gotta be 
 Never bottle me up in a probably, I wanna see or hear a 'Yes sir, 
 Sir' 
 Yes sir! 
 Thorn with a torn core, sore to the bone 
 Warn the other brothers I was born forlorn 
 Big bang, shoveling a big dig 
 Huddle in a tunnel of big dreams, I think big things 
 I'm a burn with this little light of mine 
 And a prime concern to earn thanks, I'm a be a big bang 
 *Repeat except 1st line is 'I wanna be a big bang, gotta be'* 
 I'm just a survivor of the wooly mammoth population 
 Bottle neck effect, sorta born deaf 
 Alien of shallow alchemy 
 If you gon' metamorph the basemetal to precious 
 Might as well steal from the rich, bewitch the pesants 
 I'm floating the homing pigeon out hell's kitchen window 
 Left an SOS infested bottle nested in his grip so 
 With a prayer circle release party and hardy wild bellow 
 I observed him fly ten feet then drop the bottles to the 
 Devils 
 Fertile circle turn fertile crescent via bad investment 
 Despised every second, but I GUESS I LEARNED MY LESSON! 
 If I made an angel in the snow for every rotting victim 
 There'd be wings to float this mothership up out the goblin 
 System 
 Sticky panoramic contaminant planet 
 In conjunction with phantom assumption 
 Gutterbug alumnus candidates 
 Well, I promise you I'll man the lighthouse 
 Just to help guide in your ship 
 If you promise to help pull this hook out my lip (bitch) 
 Godspeed, straitjacket and ragged approach 
 To circle suns via folklore pollutants to rhyme strictly 
 From a BC generation disgust 
 Community movement alluding to a 
 'No blood given, no recognition' 
 Life matter, I was us up all night with a rusty hammer 
 Trying to build a fence around these magic beans my dreams have 
 Gathered 
 But uh, that certain lack of avail 
 I sail a choppy lot with bouancy like a bucket of rocks (a 
 Bucket of rocks) 
 Big bang, bi-big bang 
 It's gettin' bigger by the second 
 Check it 
 Ok, I'm here to rock the tugboat and bid the others farewell 
 I shook the buddy system wisdom till the similars repel 
 I sell a barrel of spirit to dummy dimwit syndicate jackals 
 I'm broken arrow to the fuckin' bone (broken poem) 
 I don't really believe in God 
 But God, I'm scared to death of God 
 I swear to God, I never meant to spill the beans 
 Nor tear the Pod 
 It's like I hike an acre unimpressed 
 And slept on the sabre's edge 
 Enough times to splice anti-Christ's favorite pledge 
 I wanna know myself 
 Sorta solo sheep amidst wolves 
 And still my shepherd can't administer the proper push and pulls 
 I push the ghouls to man overboard 
 Pull the bulls onto my sword 
 And buckle down in a corner chair with a round table floor 
 Got an angel on my left shoulder, a devil on the polar 
 Got a mug of frigid, got a mug of solar, sliiidde over 
 The recipe's design unplug the appetite for continuity 
 By stitching together an esteemed congruence (beautifully) 
 I peel back hearts and lodge Greek physics in the chambers 
 Cauterized the wounded heads like 'Gimme gimme something 
 Major' 
 Road side prophetic, ascend well 
 Enveloped in a mummy ribbon system 
 Blistering in a wishing well 
 Big bang!
