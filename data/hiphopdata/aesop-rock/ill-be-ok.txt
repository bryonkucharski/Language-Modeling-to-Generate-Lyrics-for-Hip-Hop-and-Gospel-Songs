Burn it down 
 Pad the circles 'round your life 
 To capture all the sides you sight 
 Magic tricks where skeptics sink 
 The ice is thin, stay off the lake 
 Waiting for a clock to punch 
 Wish I could breathe and stop for lunch 
 If I stop to count the leaves 
 On only one of these here trees 
 Not sure that I know what's pure 
 Born to kill the insecure 
 Some respect, some resent 
 Some remain from start to end 
 Wear my heart on my short sleeves 
 I'm stuck out here, I lost my keys 
 From the roof I watch the street 
 And pray for those that's caught beneath 
 As long as I know right from wrong 
 I'll be ok, I'll sing my songs 
 As long as I know right from wrong 
 I'll be ok, I'll sing my songs 
 I dunno what I have to left 
 To give other than truth and breath 
 Angel when she shuts her eyes 
 Like we will leave to my demise 
 Between my time is short 
 About to start my last resort 
 Wake me up when it's time to make babies 
 Talkin' planet earthquakes 
 Tied the laces, touch the ground 
 Let emotions ruptured now 
 As long as I know right from wrong 
 I'll be ok I'll sing my songs 
 As long as I know right from wrong 
 I'll be ok, I'll sing my songs 
 Well, as long as I know right from wrong 
 I'll be ok, I'll sing my songs 
 As long as I know right from wrong 
 I'll be ok, I'll sing my songs 
 Well, as long as I know right from wrong 
 I'll be ok, I'll sing my songs 
 I wanna lift every yellowbrick 
 I never felt pressure to have to justify my selfishness 
 At least not to your and yours 
 Maybe just my friends and fellowships 
 As long as the mood is somehow linked to my enhanced development 
 I swear they'll understand 
 There's a storm outside my tenement 
 Beats upon my windows with Mother Nature's adrenaline 
 I guess that's why my homey Blockhead stays glued to the television 
 Now I look less intelligent 
 'Cause I'm the one that tried to bear the elements and lost 
 Well it's warm by the filament 
 Huddled up close in the company of all my relatives 
 Stories lash like coffee and honest-to-God sentiment 
 Cocooned in the unified efforts to all get settled in 
 Away from where the rain pours 
 Well, count your delegates 
 Weed out the bums who practice migration under the elegant 
 Of course I realize the filtering procedure's delicate 
 But let devils inside to collide with your overzealousness 
 And fall to rock bottom 
 Spot 'em with their carelessness 
 The urge could burst to turn even those hazardous to militant 
 You can't even have half of free second 
 The beat comes gelatin 
 You gotta aim, fire and aspire to be model veteran 
 Buried in merit badges 
 I'm stuck in the center and could care less 
 About the eye of the storm and its monstrous measurements 
 I got a defense that I call coolin' with my brethren 
 Sometimes I get wet 
 But it's better than risking life and limb to me 
 Don't you agree? 
 As long as I know right from wrong 
 I'll be ok, I'll sing my songs 
 As long as I know right from wrong 
 I'll be ok, I'll sing my songs 
 As long as I know right from wrong 
 I'll be ok, I'll sing my songs 
 As long as I know right from wrong 
 I'll be ok, I'll sing 
 If you wanna push, than I'm ready to push 
 But if you pulling while I'm pushing 
 Then why did you ask me to push? 
 If you wanna push, than I'm ready to push 
 But if you pulling while I'm pushing 
 Then why did you ask me to push? 
 If you wanna push, than I'm ready to push 
 But if you pulling while I'm pushing 
 Then why did you ask me to push? 
 If you wanna push, than I'm ready to push 
 But if you pulling while I'm pushing 
 Then why did you ask me to push? 
 If you wanna push, than I'm ready to push 
 But if you pulling while I'm pushing 
 Then why did you ask me to push?
