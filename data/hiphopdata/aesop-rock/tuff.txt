Dumb diggy, bump Biggie 
 Till the landlady holler, "Get a haircut, hippie!" 
 The death knell generator entertain a fresh kill 
 Breath quell dressed like a bloated sack of dead cells 
 Shedding, purple tape, purple hawk ape 
 A single flower through the permafrost 
 Pick himself and learn to walk in furry pants 
 War paint circling a duralog 
 Four-faced devil by his side like a service dog 
 Shlock purists watch the block burneth 
 One o clock prophets in the parking lot at perkins 
 The perfect politician's thirty clicks outside of Sturgis 
 Doggy bag doctors, military deserters 
 Who still shop surplus and can't hold jobs 
 I look like I'm wearing a ghillie suit but I'm not 
 Roll out ghost of Camu on the pegs 
 Might pedal by the police 
 Tough with two F's 
 Ah fuck that shit look 
 Can't tell if I'm a little withdrawn 
 Or dead dogs set to quote unquote live on a farm 
 The coke bottles tint film noir 
 Trippin' out the milk bar 
 Poison horchata cup 
 Milf in a zip car 
 Six arms six hand styles like ships on scrimschaw 
 Part Def Jam part Dischord 
 My wig picker threw me out of her office 
 Had the cold turkey benzo summer was awesome 
 Onion a benzie's (?) 
 Summer was awesome 
 Got brats on the grill 
 Wormwood in a cauldron 
 Horse hoof in the dog's mouth 
 Cholera in a well 
 Make money periodically vomiting on himself 
 I read Nat Geo craft and crack geodes 
 Lift party hats out of Craft Depot 
 Unleaded mire blood pumped through his neck 
 Came down from the mountain 
 Tough with two F's: ... 
 TUFF 
 TUFF 
 (What's so funny? 
 You, what are you laughing at? 
 I said what are you laughing at?) 
 Before player ever met his omega 
 They were effectively reducing his behavior into data 
 With plans to build a dais where the 
 People grow potatoes and cabbage 
 Don't make him raise the gate between the bettas 
 In a spectacle display in the nature of strange neighbors 
 I paint caves till the rage campaign tapers 
 Show a new crop how he used to moonwalk 
 Out of breath like a seven day old balloon dog 
 I still hang band posters and buy black lights 
 Crib decorated like a dorm room at Brandeis 
 Still pretend I'm gonna build another half-pipe 
 Nevermind the fort era christening in pantsize 
 Man, who could've guessed the future of abominal imagery 
 Would also share a birthday with Kenny G? None 
 The ninety-nine cent two cents keeps two arms folded 
 Tough with two F's 
 Yeah, let's do it like that 
 Unh I pay a guy to lean over steepled fingers 
 Then convince me to pay him for his teas and tinctures 
 The string cheese dinner kid speak Cheech wizard 
 Fore I'm gone like Gossamer under number three clippers 
 Three forged in various pulp channels 
 Even his prized horse rides a wolf into battle 
 Even his blood and body couldn't pick him out a line up 
 Or his name off the paper 
 It's Aes pronounced "why us" 
 First learn the high art of eyeing a mark 
 Buying nickels for a dime at the park 
 I learned to rhyme in New York 
 I learned to breathe underwater 
 I learned to walk with a ghost 
 Adidas reeking of sulfur 
 A children's cemetery font 
 When home is a bleeding ulcer 
 Everything you've ever stood up for is keeling over 
 Moon set beautifying 
 Cartoon death catfish on a farm 
 And tough with two F's 
 Yeah
