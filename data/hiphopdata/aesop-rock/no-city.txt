(For want of a nail the shoe was lost) 
 (For want of a shoe the horse was lost) 
 (For want of a horse the rider was lost) 
 (For want of a rider the battle was lost) 
 (For want of a battle the kingdom was lost) 
 (And all for the want of a horse shoe nail) 
 There is a hole in front of the shovel, shovel in front of the brawn 
 Six billion gorillas for whom the graves yawn 
 Each withered his mule-ish days to choose his tool of trade 
 Dueling blades that cue the cruel charade and fuel the flames 
 If you would clue the crew into the civil 
 Just get the food and land like you the man who flew the coop over the pit-bulls 
 Dash back flashy to compassionate nano police 
 Sat beneath an avalanche and jagged inadequacies 
 And I would stop the violence more than I was Pontius Pilate 
 Cops and robbers riot by the vows of noxious sirens 
 A is gullible he figure all man equal no brainer 
 Take it his friends and neighbors didn't cater 
 Moms raised the babies through a very church-y eighties 
 Sunday mornings reinforced the waiting gates of Hades 
 And he brazen but apparently inferno bound now 
 For when a man of cloth recite his wrongs he wouldn't bow down 
 The punishment should fit the reasons you must punish him 
 Never puncture skin or pull the colored rugs from under them 
 Two opposing mother ships shall not employ the gunner's deck 
 Cause brotherhoods of public good do not employ the unctuous in you 
 Observing how the giveth is disproportionate to the taketh away decide to maketh his day 
 All the stoic odium glowing a coal holster 
 When he coulda stood easily in the tub juggling toasters 
 No mountain too high 
 No city too far 
 No coma tonight 
 No city tomorrow 
 No fire too live 
 No city too charred 
 No treaty to sign 
 No city to guard 
 I pick the phone up with a grown-up mode approach 
 Skin crawlin off the drawl and now it clawed the awkward tone up 
 I'd known it wasn't roses but hoped it was less corrosive 
 Coast in to the focus of the grossest diagnosis like 
 Holmes, the barnacles that chew upon the flesh of man 
 Have clued into suitor as capital to a beggars hand 
 Comfortably, sung a stubborn legacy of gluttony 
 With carnivores that burrow like hunters into the blood and meat 
 Umm, what?!? 
 The Jenny chin up and the city picked her sinning pen up let her numb the spitting stigma 
 Along came a spider sold her eggs to any buyer 
 Now the shooter in back is six legs wider than the driver 
 If you make no friends on the way to the top rung 
 There is no secret handshake club I do not give a fuck 
 But know the cancers make the olive branches obviously standard 
 So when they extend from the yachts and mansions drop your cannons 
 All kings hang 'em for the cliff side drip dry 
 Will he clip to zip line or slip for his final dip dive 
 If he live, will he survive the milligrams of middle ground 
 They pump into the pinstripe pentagrams over tinsel town 
 Or kill a man who trickled down the city with his scissors out as sickles 
 Dipped in military hells bells and whistles 
 Riders to the east 
 Now the wild tribes 
 Thank you for the peace on earth and mercy mild high 
 No mountain too high 
 No city too far 
 No coma tonight 
 No city tomorrow 
 No fire too live 
 No city too charred 
 No treaty to sign 
 No city to guard 
 And all for the want of a horse shoe nail
