Alex up the street called, said he saw a bobcat 
 Keep the pets inside, notify your contacts 
 New Salem 
 Brave new voodoo 
 Wave a witch hammer in a haven for the woo-woo 
 I'm paper china dinner, mostly picking at my stitches 
 The bloody hair, bad code, bunny ears, dad jokes 
 Bitch about Lamictal to whichever vixen listen 
 The skin rash, the schism, a million rash decisions 
 In truth, he had a 'capital-T terrible' two days 
 That chewed his plumage to the root 
 And proved a prequel to malaise 
 A feud he knew was brewing blew up in his face 
 He'd been replaying the scenario for days 
 With the variables replaced 
 Meh 
 Wolves are in the sky with more diamonds than the carpet from the Shining 
 Part riot, part Orion 
 We jarred a lot of lightning up 
 Shook a turkey leg or ten 
 Maybe we deserve a day of rest 
 Not to mention... 
 Alex up the street called, said he saw a bobcat 
 Check your trash can lids, notify your comrades 
 I said, "I'll take first watch" 
 One AM defend the whole block 
 The coyote, summon the ghosts of blown diodes 
 Open to moving like a luchador with no eyeholes 
 Fried while the pipes froze, life goes Lovecraft 
 Christ pose, sitting on invisible hubcaps 
 Call Alex back, daggers in the basil patch 
 Tell him, "Maybe less badminton, more Scrabble Dash" 
 "Less Jarts more Rummikub," whatever 
 Keep the scallywag wrapped up in the subterfuge 
 Gussied up, guarded, and wearing the same armor as the night he argued till he dapped his man's up at departures 
 I could drive into a lake of fire 
 Pay the piper COD 
 Aware the pot and kettle shop, a little toxin equally, at least 
 It's probably more the kid than the kid 
 Either way a vital widget in the system is sick 
 A sea of symptoms in the hinges, hit the room all at once 
 All I could do was plug the roof with my gum 
 For now I gotta... 
 Call Alex back, coyotes in the castle grass 
 Tell him, "Maybe less freeze tag, more hack-n-slash" 
 I said, "I'll take first watch" 
 One AM defend the whole block 
 So a third party, who is incidentally not Alex 
 Seen a black bear catawampus by the college campus 
 Soon the safety propaganda clamps breeds on leashes 
 No compost, bird seed out of feeders 
 Make a lot of noise when you frolic under the ether 
 Keep a hand on the pepper spray 
 Sneakers on the detour 
 They're more scared of you, than you them 
 Although, one of us chews limbs, and one has two chins 
 Leave a couple messages, vomit a couple dollar bills 
 Guilty innuendo romanticizing the potter's field 
 Not sorry, but I never really was a leader 
 Found money in the speaker, bought lower Manhattan pizza 
 You meet a few exceedingly forsaken 
 Sit around the cooler refusing domestication 
 A couple decades pass and you can't even find the wavelength you was on when you was running one AM 
 By the way... 
 A third party, who was incidentally not Alex 
 Seen a bear put a thousand chickens in a pot with carrots 
 I said, "I'll take first watch" 
 One AM defend the whole block
