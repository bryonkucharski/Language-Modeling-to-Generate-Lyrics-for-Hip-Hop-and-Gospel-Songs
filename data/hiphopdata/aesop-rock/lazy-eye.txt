(Super fresh) 
 My spirit animal comes with a pretzel bun 
 Troll of the treadmill 
 Record on the Kessel Run (allegedly) 
 Edgy from elevenses to megabucks 
 Techies with the treble down 
 This is how we level up 
 Dead meat, time travel, pressure, and disease 
 As ushered out of two fingers pecking at the keys 
 The coping mechanism in his LMNOPs 
 Went from healthy to unhealthy to a hell he never leaves 
 Cineplex Jesus, curse at the curly fries 
 Mullin' over Chuck D telling me, "Diversify" 
 I'm at the SuperCuts supin' up the wardrobe 
 Forecast looking like Ganesh on four phones 
 "Hello, hello, hello, hello" 
 Base camp, space camp 
 Bass in your face-fuck, brace for the rain dance 
 Back in the back of the classroom 
 After a magical nap in a vacuum 
 Act natural, whatever that means for you 
 Whatever that means for you 
 Whatever that means for you 
 (Superfresh) 
 Before climbing douchebag mountain, I was skate or die 
 Started eatin' kale and came to terms with my lazy eye 
 Puttin' on the yoga lady, cuttin' off the cable guy 
 Whistle while you're waiting for your condition to stabilize 
 AV cables everywhere, every piece of vinyl scratched 
 Mentholated tiger balm, Aleve with the arthritis cap 
 Irons in the niacin, iron Quiet Riot masked 
 Unabashed privacy expanding into simulcast 
 40 winks, never the same adventure 
 Refreshing, or the single longest exorcism ever 
 In the end, you gotta wonder if it's even worth the effort 
 No stairways into heaven, you can step into the Escher 
 Some people have mistaken my allegiance for a weakness 
 It fucked me up for eons, I wished I was a theist 
 The type that fake his death then forget he faked his death 
 Show up on TV, in the crowd at the AVNs, like... 
 Act natural, whatever that means for you 
 Whatever that means for you 
 Whatever that means for you 
 (Superfresh) 
 (Hey peace Aesop uh It's Chuck D 
 Yo man, you keep doin' what you're doin' man 
 Keep rhymin' through those walls, all right?) 
 Sometimes I feel my heart putrefying inside my body 
 From diary of dark to piety in the ponzi 
 On my better days and then mingle and walk off into the poppy 
 On my worst, the work is overshadowed by the monty 
 Had to buy some clothes that fit me 
 And pretend I like agave 
 With a promise to his congress not to compromise the motley in him 
 Maybe I should kinda sorta move to Mars 
 I'm feeling kinda done, too many moving parts 
 The piss poor vision is forty percent floaters 
 The kitchen is a chorus of glorious leftovers 
 The friends you confessed all the dark shit to 
 Would weaponize the information before we could send roses 
 And they want a little pearl in how he got to where we at 
 I can't remember where I am, I feel it's probably a trap 
 Balk with the lawless, cough in his notes 
 Walk on even when the walls hug his coat 
 Oh and act natural, whatever that means for you 
 Whatever that means for you 
 Whatever that means for you
