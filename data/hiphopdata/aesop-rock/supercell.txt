Die already 
 None defied a one man walled city 
 Stone made flesh veins etched in his hands 
 Eighty-eight stance strengthened invasive plants 
 And rain dance on safely, brace for the supercell 
 Mutineer footage for your blooper reel who could tell 
 Pours hot tar from the top of the barn 
 Necktie on his head; condor on his arm 
 Dog star in a jar bordering unsustainable 
 Mea Culpa, mea culpa, but maybe I should pray a cult. 
 Systematic catholic or sigil of the baphomet unraveling 
 Either way his I.D. show a snake and skull 
 Always been a private dude who couldn't keep a tally 
 Of which lies he told who 
 Die his hair, shave, change names in his lazy drawl 
 Soon enough I will estrange you all 
 Like get ghost 
 On Dasher 
 Half dead carolers deck a hall, wreck a whole advent calendar 
 Brother on speakerphone lurkin' at the Burgerville 
 Bathrobe hammer toes murdering the curb appeal 
 What I be returning are forsaken with the craving and 
 Carnivourous vegetation that take him for his steakums 
 I don't know I gotta think about it 
 Truthfully I don't know which makes me a bigger coward 
 Either stomach all the hubris, cash in his two cents 
 Loose lips locked up over a chewed eucharist 
 Or, maybe reappropriate the energy 
 Hold up passin' the poultry to Hecate 
 Bull-headed burn out fled his own pedigree 
 And never better, never would've met your heaven anyway 
 Anyway, Mary Mary go make soup out of bones 
 Just know when the room go cold 
 I'm a ghost 
 G-H-O-S-T 
 Ghost ghost ghost 
 He's ghost 
 Flea comb exorcism, and de-worming 
 Fitted for a curse and a cronenberg circling 
 Search party falling forward unthwarted 
 Meet him at the crossroads drawn and quartered 
 For a master of puppets, how sad are his cupboards 
 Non-dairy creamers, can of last supper 
 And a runneth over cup full of black tap water 
 It's a marvel of privacy over back honor 
 Raspberry jelly on his Jesus toast 
 And turn heather gray sweats into Easter clothes 
 With no immediately measurable crime wave ice age 
 Christ's children still skin a cat sideways 
 I don't pick teams or administer bands 
 I'm in a creek with a pick in a panic go 
 Forcibly ejected or a voluntary death scene 
 Tell 'em what the out of order blinking EMF mean 
 Ghost
