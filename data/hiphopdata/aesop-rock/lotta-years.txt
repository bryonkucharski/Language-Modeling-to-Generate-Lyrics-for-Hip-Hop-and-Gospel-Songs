The kid that worked down at the local Baskin-Robbins 
 Got a tattoo of a lipstick print attached above his collar 
 I watch him relocating pistachio to a waffle 
 Thinking I had lost the plot if not the passion for the novel 
 He asked me what I wanted. I ordered something daft 
 He said he liked the tattoo Alex drew me of the bats. Thanks 
 I like it too but modestly confess in present company my coloring is not the main event 
 Look at that neck. The message is immediate the guy F's chicks 
 I spent a lot of years making friends with cool artists 
 So when they drew me tattoos I could truly feel important 
 It's a 22 year old inside a cube of brick and mortar 
 Got me questioning my morals in a corny pecking order 
 I should give a shit less 
 Cherry? No. Whip? Yes 
 Lotta Years 
 Uh, Lotta Years 
 The girl that worked down at the local juice place 
 Got a head full of dread locks down to her waist 
 I watch her add the spinach to the ginger to the grapes 
 My hair was underwhelming, my juice was fucking great 
 Some lady orders Maca, compliments the locks 
 She asked how many years it took the girl to grow the crop 
 "It took a lot of years and then eventually I cut them, kept them, reattach them anytime I want them." 
 My mind's fucking blown 
 Future is amazing, I feel so fucking old 
 I bet you clone your pets and ride a hoverboard to work 
 I used a folding map to find the juice place in the first 
 These kids are running wild I'm still recovering from church 
 You should have seen me in the nineties I could ollie up a curb 
 You should have seen me in the eighties I was bumping New Edition dragging acne into Hades 
 Lotta Years
