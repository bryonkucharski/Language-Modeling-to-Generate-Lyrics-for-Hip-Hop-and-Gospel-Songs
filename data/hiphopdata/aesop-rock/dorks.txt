Question: If I died in my apartment like a rat in a cage 
 Would the neighbors smell the corpse before the cat ate my face? 
 I used to floss the albatross like Daddy Kane with the chain 
 I'm tryin' to jettison the ballast with the hazardous waste 
 The kid is comfortably numb, routine a tedious crutch 
 Steep in a self imposed Stockholm and Lima in flux 
 Maybe an occupation popular with demons and ducks 
 Made any mingling akin to being seasoned and stuffed 
 It's a theatre of jumpin' jellyfish, jealous little sycophants 
 Miserable and flimsy from the skippies to the pissy pants 
 Each one separately convinced 
 They're sketching with Da Vinci's hands 
 Delusion turned the communication to prison camp 
 You fuckin' dorks ain't a threat to the cause 
 There ain't a lesson we can learn from the ostensibly lost 
 I think it's funny when defendants from identical haunts 
 Step out the tempest 
 A measure of what the spectrum involves 
 Maybe no one cares, party over here, I'll be over there 
 Don't need no help, all by myself 
 I used to hang around with rappers at the root of the scene 
 It meant a lot to feel the fugitive community breathe 
 Maybe to sentimentalize is to be truly naive 
 I know some shit about your heroes that you wouldn't believe 
 I think we're all a bunch of weirdos on a quest to belong 
 The songs are echolocation up in impregnable fog 
 That's why it's odd to see a pile of imperfections and flaws 
 Ascend a pedestal to patronize the rest of the cogs 
 In a mess of obnoxious fantasy, posturing and pageantry 
 I ain't even mad, I'm impressed, shit it's baffling 
 God almighty chop an ivory tower to piano keys 
 Play your own dirge on the way to surfin' maggot beach 
 You fuckin' dorks ain't a source of the art 
 You can't be cooler than the corner 
 Where you source all your parts 
 The poker-faced, all it takes a couple sordid remarks 
 We let the manticore out, We make the sorcery bark 
 Life is so unfair, party over here, I'll be over there 
 Don't need no help, all by myself 
 I view the rattling of sabres like a show to expose 
 Insecurities exploding in emotional code 
 With braggadocio to go from mostly jokey to gross 
 Corrode a homie till his probity is notably ghost 
 Before the hobby was a jobby was a miniature Hell 
 You would wobble round your momma like an infant gazelle 
 The disillusionment has truly been a difficult pill 
 But you as anything menacing is a difficult sell 
 In a whistle-and-bellorama, black mollies that dress up like piranha 
 It's not even compelling melodrama 
 It's a comedy, somebody wanna shop you as a saga 
 I'm very voluntarily persona non grata 
 You fuckin' dorks ain't the leaders we need 
 This ain't the medium for divas out to weasel and breed 
 I'm often coffee with the paupers over tea with the queen 
 Don't make him show the regency what disobedient means 
 Heavy load to bear, party over here, I'll be over there 
 Don't need no help, all by myself
