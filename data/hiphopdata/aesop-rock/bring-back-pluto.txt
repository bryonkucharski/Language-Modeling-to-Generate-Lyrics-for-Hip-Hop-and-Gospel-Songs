This is my friend, Tony. He's pretty cool. 
 Although he's not always so smart. 
 (Aesop Rock) 
 And then there were eight (then there were eight). 
 Just like that. 
 (Bring back Pluto, bring back, bring back Pluto). 
 In the beginning it was Large Marge sent me a bet: 
 Empty the rent if you can double-park the garbage barge gently. 
 The moon took a second mortgage on the seventh house, 
 Jupiter ain't talk to Mars, he felt the host of rovers sold him out. 
 Close your mouth, poke your snout over the cloaked aroma cloud 
 Solar boy elope with couch choking on older Polaroids 
 Motormouth show for the golden molar toy 
 Gophers yoke a fish outta water, he grows lungs and multiplies. 
 Idol. Once soldering a perfect union 
 It is vital to calculate any ornery loose ends. 
 So if mutiny ensues, the aloof is assumed nuisance 
 The clue is in his vacancy, the proof is in his goosebumps 
 Maroon the traitors, expecting acres of edelweiss 
 Who later learn it may actually be safer to play with knives 
 I show up late looking project grizzly 
 Two bowies, a third for throwing, an accomplished dickweed. 
 Nothing, nada, nil, I stuff a lot of pill to gut. 
 What's the proper rules on stuffing hostages in trucks? 
 He'll be numb enough to chill before the choppers spill the blood 
 But if I'm not? 
 Fuck it. 
 Plug him. Warpy got his goddamn groove back 
 Jet setting on spec with a dead 
 Yeti on the roof rack. 
 And miscreants will rubberneck jalopy euthanasia 
 Which will later be regretted when it's your turn for cremation. 
 And I walk like early man, 
 Freak a little witch hunt. 
 Gathering the carnies and exploiting every stigma. 
 The malformed oddities amongst sovereignty's normal 
 Shall abuse every vice you can imagine right before you. 
 All I thought of was the cloven hooved 
 And how they clip-clip-clopp over the woven roofs 
 With a nose for commotion and stolen goods... 
 Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do? 
 In the meantime...

 We were busy putting barbs on a large iron gate. 
 Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune 
 (Bring back Pluto, bring back, bring back Pluto)

 (Bring back Pluto, bring back, bring back Pluto) 
 They're gonna want his milk money next. 
 Stare into the glowing eye of Cerberus and crow 
 Authoritative laminates will not repel the quarantined alone. 
 All the town simply know the Coke machine is home 
 Where they sit and hope the Ovaltine their nobles drink is strong. 
 Couples-only roller rink was sole because of chicken you 
 Before they wiggle mittens between the pilloring of ridicule. 
 And you can hear the iron maiden's lock 
 Or see the town crier's ankle stock chained up to the tanker truck. 
 A is up early; ring and run, thank you much. 
 Document a little of the underbelly bang-for-buck. 
 A. I walk as the hype of the city gossip 
 Meaning every dumpster diver's gotta vomit up a comment like: 
 You ain't shit, this ain't hell. 
 This is little Russian dolls that get smaller and smaller still. 
 This a corpse full of pills trying to sit still and build 
 Cause eight planets bullied Number Nine until he fell. 
 No. 
 Babylon goggles, garp for the Galvatron coppers. 
 Tugboat, salvage all fossils. 
 I'll be shepherd while the whirlybirds thin out the lepers' doctors 
 But if I'm not? 
 Fuck it. 
 Tear up the metal hat and seasons 
 It's as American as skiing above a plastic D-cup. Yup. 
 Ya think Charlie Brown was Weathermen, 
 Had us zig zag around these yellow backs for peanuts? 
 In the baggy stomach lining attached to the bums in hiding 
 Sits the morals every outing he slides to refine his grinding. 
 When the freakishly disfigured have been triggered to surround you, 
 You will live inside the actual second they let the hounds loose. 
 All I thought of was the cloven hooved 
 And how they clip-clip-clopp over the woven roofs
