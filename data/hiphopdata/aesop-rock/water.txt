"I wanna be the most beautiful second coming of Christ that anyone had ever seen, but..." 
 The water ain't safe, the land's made of water 
 I hug a half empty glass my dignity's trying to pawn her 
 I'm trying to see the future in a tea cup and a saucer 
 But I'd rather be drinking coffee with my cigarette foster 
 Can a run-away buckle the cloud-nine fantasy filter 
 To force the brutal truth of daily marketplace wars through the roof? 
 I mean, I stood beneath the icicles that bleed under the awning 
 And magically mastered the great absorbing of spirits falling 
 But I'm sick I've plowed these fields a thousand times over 
 Sold botanical research studies to farmers with whole quotas 
 And when science proposes to art besides that peaceful sea 
 I'll be that cat with a ring on a pillow shouting finally 
 Take a number, the apple seeds raineth upon your slumber 
 A hundred thousand freaks on parade for the village hunter 
 My every whim acted upon has gone loopy 
 But I play a game called let's prepare barnacle city for the end-all noosings 
 I split the radius of go-getter bellies, reconnaissance 
 Sleeping fossil genie bottle optimist freeze 
 Run for the fountain but the fountain is a desert optical tease 
 Tummy full of sand running man impossible stop 
 There's a wing in my gut and I'm all dust 
 Surf in the urban Iditarod, certainly flushed 
 Now one in the hand's worth two atop the tallest cedar 
 But what's lodged inside my heart is off the motherfucking meter 
 And the Water ain't safe no more 
 "I'm just trying to build my self to act as a truly better man damn" 
 See the water ain't safe no more 
 "I'm just trying to be a solid oak tree for every child to carve its name across" 
 See the water ain't safe no more 
 "I'm just trying to be the dream of ever peasant the hurricane can offer" 
 Nah nah the water ain't safe no more 
 "I'm just trying to be some body I can talk to in the morning with a smile" 
 The Water ain't safe no more 
 And I've always been a 40 night chronologic hostage 
 Rusted hook in the lip of the monarch 
 Wingless Anime 
 I don't play in the man race cycle 
 Hope floater 
 Gloating inside carnal indifference till doom cops a slot 
 And potent quotas 
 I'm 20 something pumping acrylic tomorrow sideways 
 Blazing passage with a map tattooed on the back of the classless 
 Now tip-toe across a lost cause 
 Because a lost cause found 
 Don't mean you found a cause 
 That means you found a lost cause 
 Ok now I've been here for role playing 
 Slaying my here and now 
 To benefit consumption for my peers steering the plow 
 And it's incredible 
 Handy jackets turn numerals to sentinels 
 But bad apples ain't sweet 
 And cretin saddles ain't that memorable 
 I'm Mozart with a focus on the tide 
 Hiding the inconsistencies of man behind water and wine 
 I wear a tiger striped ego and bivouac my progression 
 Where the kindling's formulated through the flesh of the oppressors 
 Now, God had a flask I can prove it 
 You really think the 13 loops that noose honored 
 Spawned me a sober unit, check potion 
 Addressed the ghost inside my TV with a ruler 
 Adhered to the back bone, stone pusher 
 Here ten thousand hackers deep in the movement 
 That's 20,000 crucial ruby heels clicking in unison 
 It's beautiful, truly beautiful 
 I keep a stick inside my hand 
 And carve my name inside every wall of the falling hologram 
 See the Water ain't safe no more 
 "I'm just trying to build my self to act as a truly better man damn" 
 Nah nah the water ain't safe no more 
 "I'm just trying to be a solid oak tree for every child to carve its name across" 
 Hmm, the water ain't safe no more 
 "I'm just trying to be the dream of every peasant the hurricane can offer" 
 I can prove it see the water ain't safe no more 
 "I'm just trying to be some body I can talk to in the morning with a smile" 
 The Water ain't safe no more
