(Come on) (2x) 
 No (Come on) (3x) 
 (Say what) (6x) 
 All that glitters 
 is gold with no frills 
 Post no bills, and the rigmarole is so ill 
 And roadkill bake over BK blacktop 
 Summer of tough lovin' for that decayed mascot 
 To settle in a worm lunch lovely and vile 
 Half never even got comfy in a style 
 Fifteen pas (-senger) van ran around the country 
 Lugging the heavy duffels of the hungry and proud 
 Young, dumb, loud, and reppin' the locale 
 Of whatever foul four-track nurtured the child 
 And it works for a while when a stone cold serf 
 Get a megaphone and perch in a crowd--wow 
 First things first, to alert the aloud 
 Free every worker immersed in denial 
 Circle the now 'til its face turned purple 
 And never ever once turn worship and bow 
 Walk that fence 
 Like a deer in headlights through a fish-eyed lens 
 Hopped out the Ford for more folklore 
 'Til his cape got caught in the door one morn' 
 Please don't tap the phone and go 
 No lights on but the cat is home 
 Catacomb kid cuddy with his calicos 
 Try to coax thick money out the rabbit hole 
 And it's a diary of savage folk with no future 
 (No) no teacher taught him how to maneuver 
 (No) no rules so we off of the blueprint 
 With no regrets, and blame self for the bloopers 
 Cooped up, keeping the quills dipped and busy 
 With a little killer pill and no tolerance for the tipsy 
 Whether it stinks a city, I'm opening up 
 You sick of running on empty, come and soak in the smut 
 (Say what) (6x) 
 Hey, you, ready on the left 
 I was high with the winged, I was deep with the dead 
 I was dragging a dagger through the dim city dregs 
 With a blacksmith cough and a box of cassettes 
 Hey, you, ready on the right 
 I was air with the missiles, I was irked with the mights 
 I was hopped up heading for the last of the lights 
 With a sweaty upper lip on a midsummer's night 
 No (6x) 
 (Say what) (6x) 
 (Come on)
