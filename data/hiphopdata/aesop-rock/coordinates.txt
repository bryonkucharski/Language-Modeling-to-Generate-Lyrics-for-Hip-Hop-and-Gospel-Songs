(Les Miserables sample) 
 Student one 
 Platoon of sappers advancing toward the barricade! 
 Student two 
 Troops behind them, fifty men or more! 
 (Aesop) 
 I target the cruks of all that's considered sin 
 The lost child venomous neck that spittles off my chin 
 Color me what? 
 Spell-bound man hunting hell-hound 
 Special investigations set king pin 
 Bounce and of course your happy 
 Mic activist 
 Axis pivotal point spun all to often 
 Now walk and spin cycle 
 Dug psychadelic syndrome jabs your abdomen 
 I'm adament with disperse and curse across 
 You're playing your chances broken branches 
 Scattered around your mainframe type uproot it 
 My hand saluted eastward compass is spinning 
 Magnetic field my metal mind driven 
 Threshold fresh coke crush and affect 
 Mic check and spin a rec conglomerate 
 The all absorbing metamorphing monument 
 Not that average once upon a glock, glock, glock 
 Dot, dot, dot, etcetera 
 The heated mass of fire and gas threatens your retina 
 Burning you back to immobile twitchin fetal position 
 Itching for what could have been if not for who 
 This is Aesop Rock 
 I'm with 50 million troops upon my side 
 Flying towards the fraudulence coordinates 
 One hand on my mic 
 While the other drove my flag into your sidewalk 
 My sprouts stalks pawns and then I'm gone 
 Close encounters of the first kind 
 Contact cursed minds skies red 
 Stuck sitting spinning world wide webs 
 Over whim and worry flurried on your sidesteps 
 My pride treads thick 
 Utilize wide lens I slide strength in 
 Tell her gently we utilize mic like skeller 
 Tanky evidently all is not well 
 In a metra pot sell 
 Automatic hell habitat 
 Tainted polutin it's toxic to me 
 The melancholy-olly-oxygen free on the night watch 
 Boo signs reduced y'all troops to tragedy 
 Radically millions morphing the orphans 
 Spitting distortion 
 Piteous portions lacked a guiding light 
 Overiding and striding through the night 
 Story army extends mics like dendrites 
 I blend life 
 Dark then gray shapes 
 Till the splays made illustrate my views on sanity 
 If you're feeling famished we are family 
 Aesop Rock the canopy seek shelter 
 I have weaved a web across the sky hovering covering all 
 Night crawling audio visual veterans 
 Spreading like spores to the homes of all average Americans 
 50 million poets screaming all on the run 
 That's 50 million hearts beating as one 
 This is Aesop Rock 
 I'm with 50 million troops upon my side 
 Flying towards the fraudulence coordinates 
 One hand on my mic 
 While the other drove my flag into your sidewalk 
 My sprouts stalks pawns and then I'm gone
