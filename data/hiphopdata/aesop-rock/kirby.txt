Hey Kirby 
 Whatcha doing Kirby 
 Whatcha doing there 
 Hey Kirby 
 Whatcha doing Kirby 
 Whatcha doing there 
 Hobgoblin, shots of hot Strongid 
 Vaccine queen deem church socks hostage 
 Nine weeks awesome 
 Hides in a slipper 
 Look in her eye like she might be a wizard 
 Cold met a cat lady in a parking lot, she got the heroes of tomorrow in a cardboard box 
 And probably hoarding forty more in the corners of Fort Knox 
 Swapped twenty on the spot and copped the warlock 
 Back at the haunt, found God in the hamper 
 Briefs on her head playing Walking With a Panther 
 Good around misery and golden era samplers 
 Jeopardy and Wheel at the heels of her handlers 
 Bet, more than a pet to worship, it's an M.D. recommended sense of purpose 
 Here to bat around keys and the means to euphoria 
 Soon to be hailed, the greatest of all warriors

 Hey Kirby 
 Whatcha doing Kirby 
 Why'd ya eat that leaf 
 Homie don't fetch, only woke to stretch 
 Under a thought bubble rich with bowls of goldfish 
 Skittish in the company of stranger danger 
 Otherwise, chase drawstrings, tails and lasers 
 In a steel cage match with a maze of cables 
 Brazen, game face based on Azazel 
 Oversized ears up, puke in the Meow Mix 
 Shred a pair of earbuds, remedy his cowlick 
 Thanks Kirbs, lookin' like a milly 
 Keep an old man sharp, keep a cold Chantilly 
 Spun plum dizzy in a frisky moment 
 Never lands on her feet though, I think she's broken 
 Mouser in training, nap on the toaster 
 Decorate her cubicle with dogs playing poker 
 Fifteen years taking prescriptions 
 Now a shrink like, "I don't know, maybe get a kitten"
