(Aesop Rock) 3x 
 Every little step we take breaks the dreams 
 Of a warm pig itching to re-stitch the seams 
 (Vast Aire) 
 Namsayin, when I walk, I wanna break concrete! 
 Ox'll spit some shit that'll reflect off the mirror 
 My light beams are mad bright, they stay clever 
 Yo challenge an Ox member, get a vow severed 
 Found your body in the desert (Scavenger's dessert) 
 Yeah yeah I rap tight like Saran 
 Plus enter battles talkin' shit like 'Look mom, no hands!' 
 I'm tired of cats tryin' to sum me 
 You can't add that far yet, that counting is far fetched 
 I treat MC like canines 
 Throwin' words at they face to see if they bite when they catch 
 I told you my poetry sponsors Gillette 
 Now you standing there wit razors in your head like baretts 
 Man, if the mic had ass cheeks 
 The sticker in my hand would say priority seating 
 And man, I dunno if it was me or you 
 But your girl was on my dick like she was teethen 
 You play the role/roll, I'll play the poppy seed on top of you 
 The godspeed is actual, that doesn't mean I act usual 
 One of the first MC's to give the crowd full attention 
 'Cause you need love and affection 
 Chorus (Aesop Rock, Vast Aire) 2x 
 If we could absorb every star in the sky 
 We noticed some shine brighter than others, you wonder why 
 It's the simple things in life that turn the pesants into 
 Leaders 
 And we know the differences between the walkers and the sleepers 
 (Aesop Rock) 
 I boogie with picketer vision 
 Carbon based stickler 
 City piss aroma therapy coma, clone sitter 
 Itching to pigeon hole villain soul magnet 
 Feelers activate 
 Passion ate the germ and the book met the worm 
 I hold a book of matches captive to flash if the sunbeams flatline via thick fatigue episodes brewed in batches 
 The flirt of cursed at perkes nurse broken skeleton patches 
 One muddy veteran collapsed the untapped resource center housing style pagents 
 My little limbs lasso katydid wings while mankinds babysteps break dirt and demon 
 I know a crossbreed strung well in the key of mass times weight times tamed semantics encompassing that which splits lips but never supplied the bandage 
 To hell with plastic 
 We edit splendid 
 Tap it on the shoulder, grab it, tag it, aprehend it 
 Lend it to the devil to befriend it, wrench it back, mend it again, It still never ended suspended 'bove finicky picket fences 
 Now every droid dreams to manufacture hearts, start with cadaver parts and a blueprint 
 He followed the precedent set by war pigs of a yesteryear, let the tears braid and skip a stone over the reservoir to shake the whole charade 
 Gold plated tomb or spitoon, I couldn't see 
 I fell asleep holding an Appleseed, woke up holding a tree 
 The only bridge I ever burned along this legacy I dance was the one that linked the cities of Prosperity and Chance
