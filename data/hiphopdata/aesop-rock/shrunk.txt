My first name is a random set of numbers and letters and other alphanumerics that changes hourly forever 
 My last name, a thousand vowels fading down a sinkhole to a sussurus, couldn't just be John Doe or Bingo 
 My address, a made up language written out in living glyphs lifted from demonic literature and religious text 
 Telephone, uncovered by purveyors of the Ouija, then checked against the CBGB women's room graffiti 
 My social, a sudoku 
 My age is obscure 
 My 'in-case-of-emergency' is in the daisies chasing birds 
 Employed by trillionaires with perfect teeth and pores, and people who open doors for the people who open doors 
 My medical history is a course at SUNY Buffalo 
 Charlatan psychiatry and troubleshooting undertow 
 Nervous in the service still 
 I'm burger meat and purple pills here 
 "Thank you. We'll call your name." 
 Sure you will 
 Skipped lunch 
 I'm shrunk 
 You pack up all your manias 
 Sitting in the waiting room 
 You're dreaming of Arcadia, you're feeling like a baby tooth 
 Awaiting panacea, channeling your inner Beowulf 
 In Purgatory, just before you pay up to filet yourself and others 
 In the name of help, coal on the conveyor belt 
 In a ego death alone, no telephone from Gabriel 
 I'm half a human combing over Home and Garden stoned 
 Gold chains over turtlenecks, cigars over cologne 
 A thousand shitty paintings wrap around a wounded animal 
 Womb with the Schubert he's a future human-cannonball 
 Little fuckers fighting, mother hiding in her Hulu 
 I'm climbing up the stucco 
 Let's get to the seppuku, uh-oh 
 That pretty penny turn the prickly into Benji 
 If you save up all your winnings, then you get to count your blessings 
 I finally crunch the budget up and punch the button 
 She called my name out and pushed me into an oven 
 The fuck? 
 I'm shrunk 
 She says, "I'm not your enemy" 
 I said, "That sounds like something that my enemy would say" 
 Instead of playing off the chemistry she said, "You're being difficult" 
 I said, "I'm being guarded. You're a quarter mil in debt, I get more guidance from my barber 
 Look, I'm not good at this, I grew up in a noogie fest 
 You built your walls up high or say goodbye to all your Cookie Puss 
 Here's one, every time my telephone buzzes I see images of hooded riders setting fire to hundreds." 
 She said, "When you start getting all expressive and symbolic, it's impossible to actualize an honest diagnostic." 
 I said, "When you start getting all exact and algebraic, I'm reminded it's a racket, not a rehabilitation, okay? 
 Agree to disagree as grown-ups from opposing clans 
 Honoring the push and pull I should have called the Scholomance 
 Oh well. Preservation is a doozy 
 Will you be needing another appointment?" 
 "Absolutely" 
 I'm shrunk
