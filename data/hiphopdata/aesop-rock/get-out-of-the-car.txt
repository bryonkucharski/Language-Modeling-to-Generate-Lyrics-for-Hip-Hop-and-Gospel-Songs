I see how y'all be trying to front, man y'all be fronting, man 
 Been a bit since Mu died 
 Been a lot more lost than awake 
 I recall thinking someday someone's gonna say it's all from the same cause and effect 
 And I just couldn't fathom 
 Blaming a whole new page on a made-up chain reaction 
 Each claim individual peaks and pockets 
 Pains in a slew of unique nuances 
 Nah' mean? 
 When you wake up eight years non responsive 
 It's a lot to process 
 Gone from a happier jack in a box 
 To a package of clogged up chakras 
 Oh shazbat 
 Not the everafter we wanted from the once upon a time 
 Dot-dot-dot 
 Once upon a time he was so much more than a punchline for his own potshots 
 Ah! Watch the Impossible Kid 
 Everything that he touch turns promptly to shit 
 If I zoom on out I can finally admit 
 It's all been a blur since Mu got sick 
 None of the subsequent years stood a chance 
 Whether he was mom's or his man's 
 Whether he was pop's or his girl that was poison 
 Heart full of canines 
 Head full of voices 
 Whole life trying to quiet them down 
 Like a suicide king with a knife in his crown 
 Hounds at bay, but they just won't stay 
 True friendship in a tugboat way 
 "A" go dark in the face of the fucked when the fucked was a friend that was basically done 
 Into the woods go his alien tongue 
 It was that or a textbook faking a funk 
 And I can't 
 Here go to hindsight 
 8 years been one long blindside 
 I could pinpoint seven more turns that occurred 'cause he never really healed from the first 
 Oh what a world 
 Any hack is a myth 
 Any dap is a joke, any map is a trick 
 Any graph is a hoax 
 Ease on down, I'm burning up 
 I'm bleeding out 
 Knowing ain't half the battle 
 That's a bullshit quip written by some asshole 
 You can own what you are 
 And still sit around stoned in your car 
 Not doing shit, halfway to nil 
 Cranky and waiting for a boss key and hat full of bills 
 Get out the car, Aes
