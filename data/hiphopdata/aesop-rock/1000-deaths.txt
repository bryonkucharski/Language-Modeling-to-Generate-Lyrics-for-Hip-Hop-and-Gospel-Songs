Yo, 
 I saw the rod-eye cross inverted circling above my turret 
 Slither spiraling banister down a hide 
 My ruby glass glazed specs staple to trade the market thieves 
 Where vendors count the stolen citrus out they pyramids 
 Merry without a slapstick mavericks plugged directly to 3rd rail surges 
 Piss on electric mayhem through city commuter circuits 
 Ooh child, raised as oddity, son of a circus side show freak 
 Pertinent to the slide show, the winos leak but I won't speak 
 Infected projection hung thicken the air 
 Pungent is burning plastics upon whiffing the nasal cringes 
 Pucker another 60-second lapse while 60 stars collapse the suckers 
 And I'm reborn every time the wine metamorphs back to water, my god 
 Sweet Christ crucify me with railroad spikes 
 Use my skull to bash them all in, gather sit and grin, weave 
 All failed, the most serene communication's pageant 
 Where sitting with a stranger and living awards the badges 
 I spell Merit with my name stitched on my heritage 
 Incinerate arrogant simpletons to feed my cherished wind 
 Buried in leagues a please, thank you, pardon, excuse me 
 Your welcome, may I? oh, I'd like to nod but no you may not 
 Let's take a deep breath, naw let's take a breath 
 Naw let's take, naw let's ah shit, well I guess that about says it 
 Maybe I'll craft the sycamore canoe and paddle upstream 
 Where the luck seems to reflect precious lovely interventions 
 I have died a thousand deaths, and I apologize for you and yours 
 For kicking your fantasies overboard 
 I mean I'm only one servant, makin' one hell of a diversion 
 And if the masses have agreed to split the sea then let it bleed 
 I have died a thousand deaths, and I apologize for them and theirs 
 For breaking down their ropes, ladders and stairs 
 I mean I'm only one servant, makin' one hell of a diversion 
 And if the masses have agreed to split the sea then let it bleed 
 You ever died a thousand deaths? I have 
 And in the morrow stood a thousand steps from where my nervous laughter made abode at 
 Nomad, I roam in a social coma 
 Jonesin' for home alone days to sink how my poems I 
 Dig in the dirt I bring up the earth like pulley systems 
 Thereby painting the perfect metaphor for hung juries 
 Strung along a song of spawning thorns of fury 
 Numb the anti-add-alarm before he recognized this worries me 
 Carpet bomber spearheading fink-eye beretta 
 Walk my line, now what? Now strut that little poison combine 
 Y'all call natural, in honesty promise me twenty thousand salami 
 Links 
 And dive and finding my thriving ivy leaves climbing up the pit wall 
 Lack of most lords aboard, heroes unsung heroes unbrung rewards 
 Yo if I flutter in a trouble clutch then I dance fancy forward 
 Like park children double dutching ropes in burning city summers 
 My wing span can and will employ full expansion 
 Unfolding while lamping at home with my hands panning for gold 
 Told them the roof was on fire, when that structure burned to 
 Ashes 
 All y'all saw was Aesop Rock holding an empty book of matches 
 Maybe I'll sit until the spilling motors clear 
 Maybe I'll sit and stroke my billie goat beard 
 And rethink the time angels appear, maybe I won't 
 Bundled in my humble little plummet 
 Numb enough to die those thousand deaths under the sun it makes 
 Me sick 
 I have died a thousand deaths, and I apologize for you and yours 
 For kicking your fantasies overboard 
 I mean I'm only one servant, makin' one hell of a diversion 
 And if the masses have agreed to split the sea then let it bleed 
 I have died a thousand deaths, and I apologize for them and 
 Theirs 
 For breaking down their ropes, ladders and stairs 
 I mean I'm only one servant, makin' one hell of a diversion 
 And if the masses have agreed to split the sea then let it bleed 
 I have died a thousand deaths, and I apologize for you and yours 
 For kicking your fantasies overboard 
 I mean I'm only one servant, makin' one hell of a diversion 
 And if the masses have agreed to split the sea then let it bleed 
 I have died a thousand deaths, and I apologize for them and 
 Theirs 
 For breaking down their ropes, ladders and stairs 
 I mean I'm only one servant, makin' one hell of a diversion 
 And if the masses have agreed to split the sea then let it bleed
