I'm in a red zone, 
 That's my miracle meridian, 
 Boundaries lined with my minute men, 
 Slipping in, 
 S-O-S Messages float cold, captive in glass bottles, 
 While timidly crash-test authors spawn mountains of trash novels, 
 Diminished, 
 Bone Crush, 
 Skeletal Blemish, 
 Sportin' super-fresh caffeinated-hate, 
 Raise amalgamated shakes for the shield (yeah), 
 Yield to the mood slopes, 
 With blue notes the silent launch lifted but I think the ground shifted when I walked, 
 Yeah I'm the very model of a modern major general, 
 Lip-twisted, 
 You're pitiful, 
 Sink, 
 I think it was the tragedies of science versus the world's technical marvels 
 When Thermo-Nuclear Ace left the planet chemically startled 
 (Startled) 
 (I'm very effective I might add)
