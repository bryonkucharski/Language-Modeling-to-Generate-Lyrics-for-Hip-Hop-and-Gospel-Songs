No more pencils no more books 
 I built the city out one brick 
 I had a mayor and a crook 
 I made the crook stab the mayor then slay himself in the guilt 
 I stole the brick back and migrated east, now let's build 
 Every tenderfoot cadet better they be slit-throat percentages 
 Chicken penmanship tied the thirteenth knot (Hangman) 
 I arrange panoramics of a plastic catalogue 
 And where wild dogs sing tailor-made lullabies tried by my offspring 
 I'll bring the butterflies and he can bring the centipedes 
 And she'll bring the cadavers set em' free and let em' feed 
 The devil tree penciled me in but I slept thick through my alarm sock 
 Slick Willy hid in the barn while farmer charmed the crops 
 And I'm a warden 
 My tongue is full of glass 
 Because I promised my friend I'd chew up the bottle 
 If he truly drank the poison 
 I'm alienating the mating man to the high ride, base tied 
 Face mine's and make God clones 
 We can manufacture medicine 
 Cut into 5-digit slide clock the essentials in (I'll be a bill collector) 
 My destinies resting with red worms chewin" off the carcass anyway 
 Let me slay artists for tips in the penny tray 
 By the way if that diamond ring don't shine 
 That's 'cause I bought it at the five-and-dime but don't neglect the sentiment 
 I'll pedal my tricycle through the f-5 logistics of a twister 
 Soaked in the religions of a nit-picker 
 If I botched the operation I apologize (sorry) 
 The air's rooted in carbon 
 I'm but a mortal archer parked in amber waves of starlets 
 I'm fresh out of Geppeddo's woodwork asylum 
 Cedar frame, wire-bound knuckles 
 Let a tug of the puppeteer steer my hustle 
 Well when a page becomes a squire, re-engage, clap your wings 
 When a noble's demoted hope it don't sucker-punch the colony 
 But when the catapult releases lease your claims behind the bunker 
 And fasten stinger pageant results to the public eye (glory hunter) 
 Is it genuine enough to feel baby felon 
 Negotiate comradery of wills 
 How's this my little loom 
 Perv surgeon with dirty dominion monitor boxes 
 Hovering inches 'bove pertinent urchin toxins 
 Now y'all ain't excused from table side 
 Till the dinner plates fly 
 Slurping' liquid happy citzen enhancer 
 I got this slicky sycamore head shaker 
 Mimic stitch and splinter entry 
 Thereby filtering citizens hit-man prior to acts descending (tight) 
 Cats know the ambiance calm beyond comparison 
 Captive, passive spring loaded serenity 
 I'm trying to give this city acupuncture 
 Shovin one-way pins in subway systems 
 Stand up where I'm layin, now that a runway vic (push) 
 Made you go batty, spreading spawn legitimate 
 Spice the bishop, sever the ties, splinter the kinship 
 See every now and again I love life but hate to admit it 
 Cause it spreads the jinx on a sleeping cynic 
 I'm quadruple six plus scruples category mayhem stems 
 So one overlooked the scene including loopholes 
 When Christ studies the return ramifications 
 I'll burn the campus to impress him 
 Then rock like medusa glances 
 You ran the final mile before the blanks blow 
 Home alone sippin beetle juice 
 Just to numb and then shimmy the needles loose 
 I built a castle out of fifty-two cards 
 Plus jokers with an image 
 Modern theory jars us while remaining harnessed to the vintage 
 I'm mad at how far this is dishonoring Occam's Razor 
 But it seemed so being fatigued knuckle work (labor) 
 I've patched the little leakage in the shell around my greed 
 In case Tommy Turbulence located the matrix then impedes 
 ...
