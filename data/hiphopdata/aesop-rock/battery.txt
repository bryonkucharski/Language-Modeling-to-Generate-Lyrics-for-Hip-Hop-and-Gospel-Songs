(Aesop Rock) 
 Yo change the fuckin' channel 
 I burn a ((Aesop Rock:Coma|coma)) candle 
 When the flame fades, consider my flatline a soldier's sample 
 We them cats talkin' noise behind that New York trash heap 
 Where the stench of commuter briefcase replaces a bad sleep 
 And it's, worker zig-zaggers versus piggy badge flashers 
 Training Generation Fallout 
 Waterfall bricklayer pincushion crawl out 
 There's smoke in my iris 
 But I painted a sunny day on the insides of my eyelids 
 So I'm ready now (What you ready for?) 
 I'm ready for life in this city 
 And my wings have grown almost enough to lift me 
 I'm a dinosaur with Jones Beach in my hourglass 
 Passing the time with serial killer coloringbooks and bags of marbles 
 Don't tell me you ain't the droid that held the match to the charcoals 
 Don't tell me Lucifer and God don't carpool 
 (This is our school) 
 I'm not trying to graduate to life with a personalized barstool 
 Head in a jar on the desk, feet dangling in a shark pool 
 (Man please) Man please 
 My name stands for my being 
 And my being stands for the woman who stood 
 And braved the storm to raise this seedling 
 (Brother, sun, sister, moon, mother beautiful) 
 Yeah middle sibling suitable but far from son of excellence 
 Back in a long time ago, I was the way the wishers wish 
 But missers miss, I slept through my appointment 
 Saw the liquid dreams of a thousand babies solidify 
 And picked the rose that wilted 
 The second I introduced myself as Nervous 
 Well it appears the scars of learning have spoken 
 Some are burning, some are frozen 
 Some deserve tall tales, some have wrote them 
 Some are just a brutal repercussion of devotion 
 Mine are all of the above 'cause everything leads to erosion 
 Now where I live there's a homeless man 
 He sits upon a crate 
 He makes a rusty trumpet sound like the music that angels make 
 Now if you ever come and visit me, I suggest you watch the show 
 Tell him Aesop Rock sent ya just to hear his horn blow like this 
 *Horn samples* 
 (Aesop Rock) 
 And I ain't getting any younger 
 My knuckles wear their bruises well 
 I've yet to lose that hunger 
 But only time can tell 
 Prodigal Son with a prodigal wish to sew that prodigal stitch 
 And crucify bigot voodoo doll on two popsicle sticks 
 See your name is Ambiguity 
 My name is something hands can't hold 
 But hearts part ocean scapes just to watch the starlet unfold 
 It's like sketching a circle in the dirt with a pointed stick 
 Knowing the wind'll kill it some day, still it calms my burning wits for now 
 And if I plow the fields that don't guarantee plentiful harvest 
 But starving artists die, I set my alarm for five o'clock 
 Idols block survival crops the cycle stops for nothing 
 The Bible's carp revivalist winos flock by the hundreds 
 To the opening, scarlet carpets greeting their duel 
 Leading the stubborn mule to cruel rugburn 
 But y'all numb from gut fuel 
 I administer eclipse, there ain't no motor like a martyr-made motor 
 'Cause a martyr-made motor don't quit 
 I am an epiphany, I am webbed-foot mammal 
 Channel surfing my way to the top 
 Tugboat in a bottle 
 With no holes poked in the nozzle 
 I fed 'em bedlam diluted in limelight 
 Till that rookie boogie graduated hostile 
 And the vehicle is grandeur and it veered over the median 
 The second my halo ran outta helium 
 Demoted to thorn crown, damn talk about numbskull 
 I was born bound to a stencil called symmetry 
 But my energy's a rental 
 So I take this now to say 
 Thank you senorita for holding a flame to a lost wick 
 Thank you James Anthony for the band-aids on my ego 
 Y'all are family for life 
 I'll take that bullet to preserve you 
 I wanna be something spectacular 
 On the day the sun runs outta batteries 
 Attach my fashion to the casualties of anarchy 
 Save my nickels up to buy that homeless man a brand new horn 
 Then sit up on his crate as a witness to beauty born like this 
 (I ain't gettin' any younger) 
 *Horn samples to end*
