 Style messiah, Hot like a volcano with fire 
 The sound of silence versus the sound of War 
 Echo death shock-renegade 
 Crooked cynic tyrant 
 Your ignorant bias is my Goliath 
 Starving alliance seeps under the skin 
 The seven deadly sins 
 That seven elements of the malevolent 
 The relevance of 
 Graphic endeavours 
 Drastic measures took for defence 
 My secrets unfolds codes of conduct, raid 
 Blade runner, intima-dating figment in the minds of the malignant 
 Your opinion, not significant, bludgeon 
 Poetic potential draws dotted lines between hunter and hunted 
 Liquefied thoughts seep through the cracks in side-walks 
 Lieutenant cynic consist of anonymous all this seems famished 
 Vanished in gritty streets till city seeks, sleep, head, rush 
 Scope, infra-red touched 
 Temple's the torment 
 Pressure point contact 
 Crush the dormant with missing links 
 Syncopate movement, Our troubled blockade ends but I'm blemished in the blueprint 
 Behold of the hideous 
 I'm assaulted by the anthems of the lesser 
 Concerned, I squinted through tinted pains of pressure 
 Transcend, backlash, jet black ink bleeds to breath abstract interpose passages 
 Database entries slip through the fingers, you're forgotten 
 A faceless figure shall put among an infinite citizens capital coward branded in the backbones of the stranded 
 As Ace's hungered for upper handed plan strategy: strike force 
 Pays quicken upon asphalt light source sun burst beams 
 A portrait of pillage 
 Multiple put-downs paint burn marks on perception 
 Indulge indefinite challenging chapters never before have human eyes looked upon 
 The unbearable weight 
 Contaminate little thieves 
 Heaves, breath, the last gasp 
 And I last grasp, but trace through your trickery, pinpointed 
 Technique cast on the fresh but it's now thickly anointed, vicious cycle 
 Y'all spinnin if you tread before you think 
 The center of my web is pen and ink 
 It's the merciless, masquerade merging separate flows of music's martyrs 
 Threw my flag into the ground and claimed your land for starving artists 
 The masquerade merging separate flows of music's martyrs 
 Threw my flag into the ground and claimed your land for starving artists

 Dear Colleague 
 I am so very sorry that my son has made such an exhibition of himself with your daughter 
 It really does seem quite out of character 
 Although I have to admit it is quite funny 
 Of course he's really got into trouble with his supervisor 
 But I'm afraid he's only got himself to blame 
 It really ... 
 All I see is little plastic soldiers with little plastic holsters 
 Spit on plastic cultures belittled by sarcastic vulture swarms 
 Warning I'd skip your stepping stones down by the sea shore 
 It's that scarlet welcome carpet that I fiend for 
 My dreams spore schemes each more malicious than the pre-ceding 
 Red skies bleeding acid this is best inspired by your doubt 
 All through flood fire and drowning tied rapidly into humid winds 
 Lucid lens bend sigil spectrum's drippin' shades of rays I prayed for days lacking discolouring [?] 
 Bigots may seems to scare me I dissect voids my friend drawin' cranes with metal flanks [?] 
 Walkers cross Battlestars I travel far my radar flips 
 Eye of the storm following scraping my backbone 
 I try to spring clones leaving 'em like tendrils, that require, 
 More than a click-click five 
 While figments of malignant spine pleasuring quick to pigment puddles 
 Gathered in gutters 
 Type B-negative whirlpool 
 I swarm fool like you, poetically puncture 
 As still in dreams while empires fall apart 
 He a cyborg killing machine with wires in his heart 
 I'll never know of you 
 Emotion reads close encounters I run 
 The last classic example of a love of mic and sample 
 Trampled pride resurrected with ample improvement motor movement mandatory 
 Not a question of should I 
 But I passively consumed the role casted by masters of supreme sources 
 Crafted by supreme forces 
 Seemingly dream catcher 
 Aesop Rock computer Hacker! 
 See you lack a dispatch to request back up 
 Collapsing scaffold mad pole crusher Russian robot recruits 
 We shoot starving artists 'de trops' and intrude 
 I am waterfall 
 I'm excluding inaudible slaughter calls 
 Venomous survey calibrating mics for lurkin'

 This young man is clearly a genetic throwback 
 He seems to be experiencing primeval urges and feelings which frankly 
 Unless we can terminate will contaminate others 
 And threaten entire structure of our society
