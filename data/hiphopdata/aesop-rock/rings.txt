Used to draw 
 Hard to admit that I "used" to draw 
 Portraiture in a human form 
 Doodle of a two headed unicorn (it was soothing) 
 Moving his arm in a fusion of man made tools 
 And a muse from beyond 
 Even if it went beautifully wrong 
 It was tangible truth for a youth who refused to belong 
 No name nuisance 
 Fools in a bedroom 
 Oozed in a brand new cuneiform 
 Barely commune with the horde 
 Got a whole grey scale ungluing his world 
 Might zone out to the yap of the magpie 
 Unseen hand dragging his graphite 
 Cross contour little bit of back light 
 Black ink after a Bristol to baptize 
 You can imagine a rush that ensue 
 When you get three dimensions stuffed into two 
 Then its off to a school where it's all that he do 
 Being trained and observed by a capable few 
 Back in New York five peeps and a dog 
 In a two bedroom doing menial jobs 
 Plus rhyming and stealing and being a clod 
 Distractions free to maraud 
 I left some years a deer in the light 
 I left some will to spirit away 
 I let my fears materialize 
 I let my skills deteriorate 
 Haunted by the thought of what I should have been continuing 
 A mission that was rooted in a twenty year affinity and rickety condition with an 
 ID crisis 
 Nap on the front lawn look up in the sky its. 
 Shapes falling out of the fringe 
 All heart tho he woulda made cowardly kings 
 They will chop you down just to count your rings 
 Just to count your rings, just to count your rings 
 And there were 
 Colors pouring out of the fringe 
 All heart tho he woulda made cowardly kings 
 They will chop you down just to count your rings 
 Just to count your rings, just to count your rings 
 Used to paint 
 Hard to admit that I "used" to paint 
 Natural light on a human face 
 Stenciled fire on his roommates bass 
 It was blooming addiction 
 A miss and a push and a pigment 
 Book like a tattooed pigskin (look) 
 Pin head kids Intermittent 
 Drank kool aid from a tube of acrylic 
 And I grew up in a linseed oil over linen 
 Joy to the poison voice in the resin 
 Capture a map of the gesture 
 Back up add a little accurate fat to the figure 
 Re do that move that inwards 
 Zinc white lightning shoots from his fingers 
 Studios drone with allusions of tinctures 
 Stay tuned for the spooky adventures 
 You can imagine the stars that align 
 When a forearm starts foreshortening right 
 Or a torso hung on a warping spine 
 Of proportion reads as warm and alive 
 Routine day with a dirt cheap brush 
 Then a week goes by and it goes untouched 
 Then two then three then a month 
 Then the rest of your life you beat yourself up 
 I left some seasons eager to fall 
 I left some work to bury alive 
 I let my means of being dissolve 
 I let my person curl up and die 
 Eating up his innards an unfeasible anxiety is brutally committed to relinquishing 
 His privacy aligning with the trials of the anti Midas 
 Nap on the back lawn look up at the sky its... 
 Shapes falling out of the fringe 
 All heart tho he woulda made cowardly kings 
 They will chop you down just to count your rings 
 Just to count your rings, just to count your rings 
 And there were 
 Colors pouring out of the fringe 
 All heart tho he woulda made cowardly kings 
 They will chop you down just to count your rings 
 Just to count your rings, just to count your rings 
 I'm getting sick and tired of never understanding... Where is the truth you promised?!
