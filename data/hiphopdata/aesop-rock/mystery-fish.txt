Tech support, feral army 
 In a cave on a failed bed of terra-forming 
 Four corners of paranormal 
 Get shorn for a thermos and pair of thermals 
 In a warehouse air where his dairy curdles 
 St. Vincent de Paul trying to square the circle 
 Circle the source of his power 
 Foresight born at the corner of Howard on sale 
 Cherry-pick blew (?) in the pale 
 It's a blue nose chewin' his tail 
 Losing his coat 
 Schmoozing a high in the headrush 
 Hack up bile over H1N1 and then some 
 One eye on the bread crumbs 
 Other eye on the drencrom 
 Other other eye on the income 
 Good knife in a grin 
 Shoot dice with the lice and the ring worms 
 Peg leg, smells like Medellin wake in the night 
 Make a pipe outta anything 
 Take five take a dive in the cellophane 
 Turn five into five six seven eight 
 Back out black out 
 Some weren't fancy 
 Shake in the back seat of Aesop's camry 
 Dude, seat full of chips and sandwich meat 
 From the crypt in the end 
 If ya give an address and a rib or a piss 
 Don't question the mystery fish 
 Just picture shrimp on a pillow of grits 
 Close your eyes, lick your lips 
 I'm at the cafe ordering a cup of fresh 
 Sarah gave me two, I gave one to Rex 
 He said, "Fools ain't shit plus fuck the pigs 
 They could never understand what Sumner is" 
 (Word up word up word up) 
 I'm off the grid 
 I'm through the gate 
 I fly these kites into the fray 
 (Word up word up word up) 
 I'm out the box 
 I'm through the mud 
 I fly these kites into the cut 
 NorCal fried bacteria 
 No I.D. survive the vivarium 
 Try soft feel sourdough and heroin 
 Eat with the chimera fly with the seraphim-ight 
 Hold court with the cats and dogs 
 Who hold cools like an orb in a dragon's claw 
 And terry cloth robes outside detox surly 
 Curse of the beat cop doctor a slurpee 
 And not no Xerxes fear no moon man 
 Stay true like a wolf wearing wolf pants 
 Ooh, never could avoid himself 
 For long enough to contain or employ his help 
 And now we look both ways at the asteroid belt 
 Buzzed, gross unholy unloved 
 Still hear an ex in his head yelling, "Kiss the ring!" 
 From a fortune of fisher king 
 And from assistant care blisters in his hair 
 New day new diary of disrepair 
 Soups on two tongue crucifix to bear 
 No shoes no shirt no fiscal year 
 I said "Hello" to Marshall every morn for six 
 He yelled at me every time, "That's amore, bitch!" 
 Only took one tooth to crack the bug juice to chug 
 Turn the bum to a Sun Tzu, bug 
 Outside home is an open swim 
 Occultism in the throes of corrosive wind 
 A cold meal with the ghost of friends 
 A whole host of meds 
 A deal on a Tone Loc cassette 
 I stepped over a body in the door 
 I pretend he asleep but it's probably more, God damn! 
 Profound apathy, heart with a crack 
 I'm ships in the night 
 I'm darts in a map 
 Word up
