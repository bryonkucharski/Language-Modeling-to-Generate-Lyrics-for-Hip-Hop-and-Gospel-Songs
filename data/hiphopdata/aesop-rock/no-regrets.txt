Lucy was 7 and wore a head of blue barrettes 
 City born, into this world with no knowledge and no regrets 
 Had a piece of yellow chalk with which she'd draw upon the street 
 The many faces of the various locals that she would meet 
 There was Joshua, age 10 bully of the block 
 Who always took her milk money at the morning bus stop 
 There was Mrs. Crabtree and her poodle 
 She always gave a wave and holler on her weekly trip down to the bingo parlor 
 And she drew: men, women, kids, sunsets, clouds 
 And she drew: skyscrapers, fruit stands, cities, towns 
 Always said hello to passers-by they'd ask her why she passed the time 
 Attachin' lines to concrete but she would only smile 
 Now all the other children living in or near her building 
 Ran around like tyrants, soaking up the open fire hydrants 
 They would say, "Hey little Lucy, wanna come jump double dutch?" 
 Lucy would pause, look, grin and say, "I'm busy, thank you much" 
 Well, well, one year passed and believe it or not 
 She covered every last inch of the entire sidewalk, 
 And she stopped- "Lucy, after all this, you're just giving in today?" 
 She said, "I'm not giving in, I'm finished," and walked away 
 1 2 3, That's the speed of the seed 
 A B C, That's the speed of the need 
 You can dream a little dream or you can live a little dream 
 I'd rather live it 'cause dreamers always chase but never get it 
 Lucy was 37, and introverted somewhat 
 Basement apartment in the same building she grew up in 
 She traded in her blue barrettes for long locks held up with a clip 
 Traded in her yellow chalk for charcoal sticks 
 And she drew: little Bobby who would come to sweep the porch 
 And she drew: the mailman, delivered every day at 4 
 Lucy had very little contact with the folks outside her cubicle day 
 But found it suitable, and she liked it that way 
 She had a man now: Rico, similar, hermit 
 They would only see each other once or twice a week on purpose 
 They appreciated space and Rico was an artist too 
 So they'd connect on Saturdays to share the pictures that they drew 
 (Look!) 
 Now every month or so, she'd get a knock upon the front door 
 Just one of the neighbors, Actin' nice, although she was a strange girl, really 
 Say, "Lucy, wanna join me for some lunch?" 
 Lucy would smile and say, "I'm busy, thank you much" 
 And they would make a weird face the second the door shut 
 And run and tell their friends how truly crazy Lucy was 
 And Lucy knew what people thought but didn't care, 
 'Cause while they spread their rumors through the street 
 She'd paint another masterpiece 
 Lucy was 87, upon her deathbed 
 At the senior home, where she had previously checked in 
 Traded in the locks and clip for a head rest 
 Traded in the charcoal sticks for arthritis, it had to happen 
 And she drew no more: just sat and watched the dawn 
 Had a television in the room that she'd never turned on 
 Lucy pinned up a life's worth of pictures on the wall 
 And sat and smiled and looked each one over just to laugh at it all 
 Now Rico, he had passed about 5 years back, 
 So the visiting hours pulled in a big flock o' nothin' 
 She'd never spoken much throughout the spanning of her life 
 Until the day she leaned forward, grinned and pulled the nurse aside 
 And she said: 
 "Look, I've never had a dream in my life 
 Because a dream is what you wanna do, but still haven't pursued 
 I knew what I wanted and did it till it was done 
 So I've been the dream that I wanted to be since day one!" 
 Well, the nurse jumped back - 
 She'd never heard Lucy even talk, 'specially words like that 
 She walked over to the door, and pulled it closed behind 
 And Lucy blew a kiss to each one of her pictures and she died.
