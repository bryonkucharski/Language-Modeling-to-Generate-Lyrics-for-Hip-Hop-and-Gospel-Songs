So I heard y'all wanna float... 
 Yo, this fallen angel could stitch a wing with a shoestring 
 Prime directive selects reflective aviation bathed in mood swing 
 (I'm broke) I know a walking corpse that spit icicle dagger to slit throat 
 Quicker than you can prove there's four letters in hope (h... o... p... e) 
 I paint a portrait of myself, bored life inside the tortoise shell 
 Tortured, orbiting Hell's orchard, intrigued but not compelled 
 I smell a hint of charred childflesh sweeping through my corridor 
 More than one canteen, a liquid caffeine and eclipse the slaughter 
 How is you is the villain of my Kabuki hologram 
 As I hobble with hollow hands (please pin the nozzle!) 
 We see intent to reinvent dream application with homage to ancients 
 But honor modern replacements circling now basics (fresh!) 
 I'm Bilbo Baggins with stilts tippin' the petri dish 
 Beached fish on the shores with a feast of wits eats the corpse 
 Divvy the servings and study the traits that deemed killer breed credible 
 Now that's a harp of a different color (yeah, but the song remains identical) 
 I am not a crook (crook) 
 I cook the wick at both ends just to blend that element of chance with my tight rope leaf 
 (Life) sight beyond, I reign where hunger pain got begone 
 Elong to something civil saint 'cause this Rembrandt paints on 
 And it's a tall canvas, lodged in the gut of Atlantis 
 I'm pretend, oppressive lungs, some truly learn what a death chant is 
 I alone personify mankind's collective soul 
 As the result of one angry Zeus fist blistering cult pulp evoked 
 Face it (die), place it on the shelf next to that portrait Mommy gave you 
 On the day it rained, but y'all posed by the slave ship anyway (how sweet) 
 Make it rain till the levy breaks 
 My defeatist priest is a combine of Father Time and his sweetest concubine (whine) 
 And it saddens me like televised casualties 
 I'll be hung in the village square in exactly five minutes 
 (You don't want to miss it!) 
 I've been soaking up my discontent regarding the equation 
 And I'm officially closed for consultation 
 I float 
 When everyone around me's busy drowning, I float 
 When everyone around me's busy drowning, I float 
 When everyone around me's busy drowning, I float
