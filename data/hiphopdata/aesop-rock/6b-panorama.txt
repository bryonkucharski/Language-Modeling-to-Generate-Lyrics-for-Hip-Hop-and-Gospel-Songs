I was sitting on my fire escape and I saw... 
 Sturdy bridges, decorated with dirty pigeons 
 A vagabond begging for three pennies and a princess 
 A junkie tourniquet surgeon urging the needle in 
 A batty senior citizen flashing that awful teethless grin 
 I saw a corner store merchant rest on a milk crate with a stog' 
 A pierced nose, a model with a stalker, cheap hooker, jay 
 Walkers 
 A table on a sidewalk with four old men slappin' dominos down 
 A city, a village, a neighborhood, a ghost town 
 I saw vandals catching tags and Puerto Rican flags 
 I saw a pregnant woman on the verge of bursting (boom) 
 I saw a blind man with a dog screaming 'someday I'll see it all' 
 And then he sat down with his hammer and saw 
 Business men with multi-colored ties, cashmere checks 
 A nazi with tattoos on his neck, a Vietnam war vet 
 A Caucasian man with a limp and a cane, a pimp with his names 
 A thug circus, a pack of shook tourists hugging their purses 
 I saw freaks with rainbow streaks in dayglo hair 
 A mother smackin' the grin off her child, replaced it with a 
 Stare 
 A pothole, a storefront with a broken open sign 
 A hole in the wall bar kicking drunks to the gutter, it's 
 Closing time 
 I see a fuck up, a bum knuckle up with a taxi driver 
 A squatter, a grandfather, an angry right-to-lifer 
 I can see the roof garden on the apartment across the street 
 And kick myself because somewhere along the way I lost my seeds 
 I see a rat, a roach, a bat approach, a happy student 
 A black man with a horn and a will to make you sit and listen to 
 It 
 I see a little girl on the corner with bubbles, braids and 
 Barrettes 
 I see a teen mother with similak pacifier and regrets 
 Oh, a day turned stale, a hammer with a rusty nail, a failed 
 Marriage 
 A universe of brick buildings slightly off balance 
 A challenge, I see a chance to add real colors to my favorite 
 Palette 
 Raise my mighty mallet towards the gods and swing my talents 
 I see a crack in the sidewalk 
 A slide show of six civilians gripping bottles of gideon 
 Sitting inside bent meridian 
 There's a fun house ooh, a sun spout 
 Spraying yellow beams above yellow back dreams 
 And children in the hydrants 
 Tyrants (?), I see sirens 
 The wall to the glamor standard 
 A dead bird, a bent curb 
 A bus stop of commuters waiting to have their souls towed off to 
 Work 
 I seen the slap dash habits of bike messengers paws 
 And hug that good leaf on the way to damaged packages, 
 Dependence 
 Oh my lord, I see bandwagons, all aboard 
 A carnival amusement park where a heart is a luxury 
 I see a gas galaxy huddled behind those pearly doors 
 Maybe I should sit up on my fire escape a little more
