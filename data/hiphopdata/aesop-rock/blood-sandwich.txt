Yup 
 Steps up to the plate 
 Little brother, Little League 
 '87 he was 8 
 Rookie season for the skinny slugger 
 Newly out of tee-ball 
 Pit against a pitcher with a ripper you could eat off 
 Church, and a grip of loons run to 3rd first 
 Granny yelling "Go Cubs!", nose in her word search 
 See MILFs like apes on a monolithic bleacher, and are advocating war and peace in lieu of sport and leisure 
 "Hi Peggy" 
 I was 10, chewing on a sweet tart 
 Little brother, left-field, Queen's guard 
 Mean arm, knees bent 
 Two out, two on bags 
 When I caught him staring down at something moving through the grass 
 Hold up 
 Tagged runner, and the whole cast rotate 
 Not before he could identify the culprit 
 Granny yelling, "Go Cubs!" 
 Graham yelling, "Gopher!" 
 New left-fielder give a fuck about a homer 
 Got a homie, little rodent, head and shoulders out his hovel 
 No baseball in the bubble 
 Ruh-roh 
 Parents thought it adorable 
 The players followed suit 
 Inning crawling to a close 
 Head coach not amused 
 Coach seeing red 
 Coach on the diamond dragging 27 inches of aluminum behind him 
 When he transverse third, the families turn nervous 
 The following is a transcript of man vs vermin 
 Here we go 
 Man stands out by a hole 
 Pest pops up to patrol 
 Man plays live whack-a-mole 
 In a scene that would try every child as adults 
 Woah 
 Pallbearer with a ball mitt 
 Thrown over the fence 
 Coach hit the bench 
 Both teams lose 
 "Good game. Good game" 
 Granny yelling "Go Cubs!", Cubs ain't playing 
 My little brother is a funny dude 
 A lot of funny shit happened to him 
 My other brother pretty funny too 
 Ain't seen him in a minute though 
 Just in case of rough waters, I wanna put one up for my brothers 
 Just in case of rough waters, I wanna put one up for my brothers 
 Yup 
 Not a part of the machine 
 Big brother, big idea, 9-0, 16 
 Neubaten tee, plaid flannel laden adolescent art kid 
 Tony Hawk hair, Skinny Puppy denim 
 And a record player vomiting Alien Sex Fiend 
 Peel sessions in a Christian home for field testing 
 It's real youth in the palm of your hand 
 When your mom thinks Satan is involved in a band 
 We were buried in the Village Voice 
 Checking who was playing where 
 Pulled his head up out the paper, pushing out a single tear 
 Five words, like a beacon of light in the mist 
 "Ministry live at the Ritz" 
 It was Christ has risen to Chris 
 Three loaves, two fish 
 Miracle of mechanized loops on 2-inch 
 Coming to a theater he would be there in the flesh 
 Moms didn't say "No," but she didn't say "Yes" 
 Copped tickets, ha the plot thickens 
 Countdown to ultimate concert experience 
 Moms still worrying 
 "Why are they called Ministry? Are they a cult?" 
 Maybe she could properly investigate 
 Bought a mag with an Al Jourgensen interview 
 Read a couple sentences, glanced at a pic or two or three 
 That's all, no fair trial 
 Simply, "You will not be going to the show and that's final!" 
 What occurred next were the top of the lungs of a son who unjustly had lost what he loved 
 In a moment that would transcend anger to high art 
 Said, "This is something I am willing to die for!" 
 Can you even imagine a death in the fam from industrial fandom? 
 Anyway, no body count no concert and Chris kicked rocks in his mismatched Converse 
 My older brother is a funny dude 
 A lot of funny shit happened to him 
 We hadn't spoken in a couple moons 
 I called him last night 
 "How you doing?" 
 Just in case of rough waters, I wanna put one up for my brothers 
 Just in case of rough waters, I wanna put one up for my brothers 
 Just in case of rough waters, I wanna put one up for my brothers
