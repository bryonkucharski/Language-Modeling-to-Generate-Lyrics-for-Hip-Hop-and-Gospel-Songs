(Vita es morte es vita 
 Life is death is life) 
 Found nothing but the feathers and the skull 
 On the porch like a present with a bow 
 Dinner's in a black earth gutted and uncoupled from the patchwork 
 Buried by a seven year cherub in the backyard 
 Epitaph and all 
 Disciple o' the cycles and sciences of birth in a fertilized hyacinth 
 Life in the vitamins invited up to cypresses 
 A testament to moxie in the miracle of lifelessness 
 It's tricky when you'd rather rot into the soil as a nutrient 
 Than navigate this mortal coil in human skin, dig 
 The nuances of putrefying jelly 
 Hit the levee when those feathers are a cancer in your besty 
 And I pick a ginger gold that's fed by a drunken uncle 
 One from a customer pumping that sumner blood work 
 Remember them ascending settling any high scores 
 Forty meters up with the heart of a high dive horse 
 Paint "No Rules" on the water tower 
 Paint "No Rules" on the water tower 
 Paint "No Rules" on the water tower 
 Paint "No Rules" on the water tower 
 Impossible, impossible 
 (Hold the fuck up 
 Who is you talking to? 
 Cause ain't nobody talking to you 
 You can't do a motherfucking thing) 
 I told my ex in '97 I was falling on my weapon 
 Ripped the phone up out the wall 
 The po dragged me from my bedroom 
 An embarrassing ordeal involving hospitals and questions 
 And the kinda doctors who use words like "cognitive" and "spectrum" 
 While explaining why you're selfish 
 To romanticize our rules 
 And watch unruly roots 
 Pull you to Lucifer 
 By your shoes I mean, it isn't perfect 
 Don't misconstrue the purpose 
 Any urge isn't discernible from 
 Community service to the kiddo 
 Plus you'd make a beautiful widow 
 But that's an altruistic ticket to a room with no windows 
 Hmm you'd think he would've learned back in the eighties 
 When they pulled him out of class over concerns about his safety 
 But he didn't, it wasn't 'cause he doesn't get the message 
 More he doesn't judge a man by how honorable his death is 
 On a scale you made up anyway 
 Half passed out to pasture 
 Whether clapped your batteries in backwards 
 Paint "No Rules" on the water tower 
 Paint "No Rules" on the water tower 
 Paint "No Rules" on the water tower 
 Paint "No Rules" on the water tower 
 Impossible, impossible 
 (Check this shit out here 
 Don't be trying to come all for me 
 Cause you is not all of that with your fucked up haircut) 
 I had a pet lizard, he never got an obit 
 Fed him crickets, it was dead a fucking month before I noticed 
 An older me would note that whether disposable goldfish 
 Or theist, we certainly become the Earth as equals in a circle 
 Meek until the spirit isn't willing 
 While the flesh is still a staple of the labor forcing whistling 
 It's roadkill evoking emotion his own totem don't 
 That's a reality you evade or grow to own 
 Social code broken, a hierarchy to gasp at 
 Black labs over wet dads on the admat (?) 
 Tabby (?) of a parasite, bats at the parish 
 A civil war becoming of ungovernable atoms 
 I'm born from the guts of stars and black tar pits 
 Iron Maiden denim paint the devil under grawlix 
 Crawls out a clawed coffin a huff and puff 
 Somewhere in between the dust and dust 
 Paint "No Rules" on the water tower 
 Paint "No Rules" on the water tower 
 Paint "No Rules" on the water tower 
 Paint "No Rules" on the water tower 
 Impossible, impossible
