Postcards from the pink bath paint leisure 
 As a cloaked horse through a stained-glass Saint Peter 
 Hack faith-healer, cheat death to the very end 
 Cherry wooden nickels on his specs for the ferrymen 
 X, o, zodiac a pentagram expo 
 Pet cemetery in electric fresco 
 Abaddon threshold flesh-forged in the galley 
 With undead Orcs pulling oars through the algae 
 Smash cut to a smoke-bombed quarantine 
 Guards like "all signs correlate with sorcery" 
 It's more a dormant cell of valor as awoken by the smell of sordid power 
 And defecting shortly after 
 Fist bump dry land, brackish, cat nap 15 
 Back to Swiss-cheese the flagship, uh 
 Blue in the menacing grip of a day for which you're manifestly unfit 
 Final answer "not to be", "not to be" is right! 
 Next question - to build winged shoes or autophagy 
 Silk screen band tees, take apart a VCR, ringer off, canned peas 
 Cabin fever mi amor 
 Patiently adhering to the chandelier ta key-in-door 
 To usher in the understated anarchy of leisureforce 
 Led a purple tongue and ratty caballeros 
 Up over the black rainbow into the house of mirrors 
 To become a thousand zeroes 
 Echoing a twisted alchemy, freak flags, fluttering to circadian free jazz 
 Sleep apnea scratching "bring that beat back" 
 I doze off, clothes on, noise in the feedbag 
 Shhh... om nom nom, blinds drawn 
 Compost thrown to the spine pile, bygones, mangy 
 Intimately spaced pylons on a plot of inhospitable terrain 
 Hi mom! 
 Raise up the bridge, lower the portcullis, rain forks into mutton 
 No abort button, heart pump assorted color sugar water 
 Poor lummox, unexplained ailments, and doesn't work well with others 
 Wet nose on the glass, Garibaldi half cookie dough, lock jaw 
 Don 4 walls like a wooden coat, behold the rotting fruit of excommunication 
 A ruby tide insubordinate to lunar phases 
 That maneuver past the beaches to the bosom of the pavement 
 Now the bow drill smolder in a flooded bit of basement 
 Grace of misled teen who prefers his scenes with a little Wilhelm scream 
 The ambush predator edition, skill set of Will Tell Aim and speed over short distance 
 Part hatter-mad, part erratic habitat, dark matter harnessing his heart attack-ack-ack-ack-ack 
 Midsummer bit crusher, midwinter bit shifter, no sleep, gold mine, front door circled, proceed, low light, 24 curfews, crows beak, cold night, unmoored virtue, proceed, snow-blind, 24 curfews
