Burn train buffers 
 My fancy 
 Up jumps the boogie delivering eye jammies 
 Walk through the muck with a clutch on a trident 
 Never give a fuck how far Pi went 
 You are dealing with a reborn icicle age poltergeist 
 Uprock, sidewalk cycles stuck at the bus stop 
 Wookie foot must not sleep 
 Under the invaders 
 No batteries 
 No jumper cables 
 Wired underagers play box cutter facelift 
 Rock utter makeshift spirit 
 To y'all I'm just a funny moniker with a couple of fresh records 
 And a bangin' hand style to put the jukies On the guest list 
 Walk for that 
 Metal train graf brainiac 
 Walk for them 
 Not a limelight 
 More to blush alizarin crimson 
 When the multi million 
 Tin men suck traditional rituals 
 Out the homes of starving children 
 And I bet they can see the city bleeding from the satellites 
 Formed by the corporate war drums recorded poorly 
 Dirty dub vamp. 
 Bruised by the hues of wicked pallets 
 Chewed by the tooth of livid maggots 
 Dino DNA and cola, straight no chaser 
 Mars attacks colorfulness 
 I piss raptors on motherships 
 Hazy days will stay purple 
 Cause Cips with a Z bargain 
 Like Crazy Eddie commercials 
 Go Ah Ah Ah Ah 
 Network with a dirt devil 
 Burn train buffers. 
 Hi! 
 Cute the way your little parasol spins. 
 Bye! 
 Suck my Neanderthal dick. 
 Catapults spit. 
 Losing the screws and bolts 
 And all they heard's crews gulp in bulk and sulk in volts 
 Zap! 
 Radio m-m-m-m-mayhem, fine. 
 Suicidal eye full of plastic nine. 
 Bang! 
 No batteries etc 
 Come on

 Jump motherfuckers 
 No batteries

 No cables 
 They only came to buff the name stuck the train 
 That's a textbook page 
 For my seed up in flames

 Curators cater to killers of innovators 
 I'm a staple 
 No batteries no jumper cables 
 Choke train buffers like a headlocked Ed Koch 
 Nurture the craft of concrete visionaries 
 Cave painters screaming "Loosen the cuffs!" 
 Cave paintings get the natural history feather dust 
 Pick a lust. 
 Limo tint stretch delorian chrome sittin' on twenties 
 Then I walk to the stouge, burning my laundry 
 Lo Pro, 
 Fucked up jeans back at the party spinning Kane meets Flight of the Valkryies in a heartbeat. 
 Saber tooth, catalog, city art, liturgy 
 Ranger Ricks endanger the clique maximum efficiency 
 And isn't that dope? 
 The line of blind winged Pygars and how they wallow planks into the matmos. 
 Binder bibles and a graphite prison violator 
 With Joshua for the war gamer systems. 
 Now the architects are rioting 'cause we built something different 
 I'm like how the fuck sure shot evolution not my business? 
 My elephant television was on. 
 Grape soda, Grape ape, Great space coaster, 
 DnD, GI Joe, Transformer, Herculiod, ThunderCat, Voltron, Speed Racer, Space Ghoster. 
 Kiss the flickering images with Carroll Ann fingertips, 
 C-4 to four chamber skips, 
 Oh shit... 
 They say his eyes were spiraling back when he hit the mat 
 Woke first words: "Oh it's like that?" 
 Started bendin spoons and rippin arrows outa lady hawks 
 With a C3P unit tryin' to interpret the baby talk 
 Burn train buffers 
 Right turn woulda missed the iceberg, fine. 
 But you don't like our kind. Do you? 
 Junkyard Dog. Hot tin roofs cradle kittens with them sub par flaws. 
 Rappin' is my radio, graffiti is my TV 
 B-boys keep them windmills breezy.
