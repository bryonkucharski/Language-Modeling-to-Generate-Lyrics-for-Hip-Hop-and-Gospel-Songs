Yeah, this just my life 
 Front to back, top to bottom 
 Everything's changing around me 
 These days don't feel the same 
 We all lost faith and lost family 
 Why must we play this game? 
 Lord have mercy on me 
 I've been a sinning man 
 Pull out my wings, jump off the bridge and crash in a plane 
 If I never land... 
 Know I never die 
 We live forever in my mind 
 And I sanctify 
 We live forever, still alive 
 There's a lot going on but I stick to the ones I love 
 I never claimed to be a perfect man but name a great man who was 
 Consequences of my actions in the past years had me stressing out 
 It was like, May, I just moved to L.A., I was tryna figure it out 
 Medication for depression that I cut cold turkey, had the kid manic 
 In an episode out in Hollywood, wilding out like Nick Cannon 
 Railing Adderall pills out a dollar bill, on the bathroom floor 
 Clean the whole mess up with my nose, what the fuck I need a vacuum for? 
 New York City on my birthday, June 6th, 2014 
 I had that first meeting with Hov, plus I brought out the whole team 
 I drank that whole bottle of D'usse Ty Ty gave me that night 
 When we left the club after Rap Genius house me and shorty got into a fight 
 She came out the room swingin', hit me in the jaw 
 I was really tryna fend her off 
 But I ended up in the closet with my hands around her neck 
 I was tripping, dawg 
 Too proud to apologize or empathize, I blamed it all on her 
 Saying that she hit me first, even though she was the one hurt 
 I was really just reflecting all the hurt that I was feeling from the band's rejection 
 When Kids These Days split, that shit felt like a c-section 
 And my infidelity and jealousy with Natalie on top of the amphetamines 
 And the ecstasy had me tryna drown face down in the Chesapeake 
 The next month I dropped "Down on My Luck" and had Europe going nuts 
 But I couldn't even appreciate it at the time, I was going through too much 
 Now I had to leverage million dollar label deals on the table for my records 
 In Ibiza eating paella on the roof, tryna choose over breakfast 
 Hov wasn't with the bidding war, but I knew the Roc just felt right 
 When I saw Kanye at Wireless, without T-Pain, still a good life 
 Felt so close when Mr. Hudson introduced me to him backstage 
 He prolly don't even remember that shit... like a bitch off Backpage 
 But at that stage, I was ready to swing for the fence like a batting cage 
 At the same time, I was winding down a low point in my addict phase 
 The Adderall started wearing off and I went into a deep writer's block 
 All over a song that I couldn't finish that I wrote about signin' to the Roc 
 Isn't that ironic? I was feeling so psychotic 
 With the whole world excited for me and my idol saying I got it 
 Shit got bad out in L.A., so I moved back home to my mom's basement 
 Linked up with Smoko and Papi Beatz and took it back to basics 
 Then I wrote "Rage," that was me screaming out through the pain 
 And "U Mad," addressing my relationship with Natalie, it was too bad 
 The violence and the lies slipped suicide into my mental health 
 I did acid in the studio one day and almost killed myself 
 As I started to fall apart, certain stars started to align 
 Om'Mas came to Chicago in January at the perfect time 
 He said Kanye was working on an album, and Uzi played him one of our songs 
 He was tryna fly me out, nigga, it was goin' down like the Dow Jones 
 Pulled up to Westlake, first day I was there, I recorded "Wolves" 
 I knew I was the one, like Neo meeting with the Oracle 
 But I had to get a handle 'fore the door was pulled 
 Crawled out on SNL 
 All the niggas hating on me back home lookin' at me like, "FML" 
 A lot of people coming out the wood like, "Let's work," tryna network 
 All the pressure making my head hurt, the molly wouldn't let the meds work 
 At this time it's like Feb. 1st to the 15th, and I'm still addicted 
 Frustrated, writing shit for Ye, tryna visualize someone else's vision 
 Then he laid that verse on "U Mad" and we made the shit the single 
 Ye and Hov getting into it over me, tryna do a joint venture 
 And G.O.O.D. Music still fam, but it's that Roc boy SAVEMONEY life 
 Took the bus out on the road for the Traffic tour, did a hundred nights 
 Cleaned out my closet, I got rid of all of my demons 
 If you learn one thing from my journey, nigga it's don't stop believing 
 When this shit got so suffocating I could barely even keep breathing 
 Wrote my wrongs all in this song now I'd like to welcome y'all to my season 
 Nigga I'm gone 
 Know I never die 
 We live forever in my mind 
 And I sanctify 
 We live forever, still that life
