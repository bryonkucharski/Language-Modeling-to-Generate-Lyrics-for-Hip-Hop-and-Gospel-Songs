Color of morning pee coming out of the sink 
 It's 2016 who would think 
 Kids in America don't have clean water to drink 
 Like they cut the EBT, took 'em off of the link 
 I read a story about a woman with her daughter in Flint 
 She got lead poisoning from showers in the morning 
 When the governor switched out the pipes to bring the water in 
 To the city river 'cause he said they can't afford to get clean water 
 So now the poor people get the shorter end 
 Of the stick, ain't that some bullshit? 
 Shorty thirsty, he just bought his fourth fifth 
 It's lead in the water gun, he dying from a full clip 
 Now you've got toddlers drinking toxic waste 
 While the people responsible still ain't caught no case 
 I don't get it man, I just ain't wit it man 
 They got Damn Daniel distracting you on Instagram 
 Back again with the all-white media coverage 
 They do it over and over like remedial subjects 
 The people with the least always gotta pay the most 
 We the first to go when they deleting them budgets 
 Can a nigga get his basic human rights? 
 Is that too much to ask, should I say it more polite? 
 And everybody broke so we in the same boat 
 But would they let that bitch sink if we was white? 
 It got me shades of blue 
 Rain or shine, it's all blue, it's all blue 
 Ain't no sun, it's all blue, it's all blue 
 Purple haze, in a daze, it's all blue, it's all blue 
 Change gon' come, it's all you, it's all on you 
 It's all blue, all blue 
 It's all blue, all blue 
 The skies stay gray, around my way, around my way 
 Waking up to the morning sun in Detroit 
 I'll be with the people when they come for the boy 
 Everybody tryna be American Idols 
 My X-Factor is I'm the only one with The Voice 
 It's bigger than us, these kids listen to us 
 That's why I give 'em that truth 'cause they don't get it enough 
 We making bitches and hoes out our women too much 
 We can't trust ourselves, and we don't know who to trust 
 It ain't enough for police to wear body cams 
 Cause niggas still gettin' tazed and body slammed 
 And cigarettes'll kill you on their own but they'll kill you for a cigarette, I honor Eric Garner fam' 
 I'm a part of him, he a part of me 
 I'm a prodigy in these Prada jeans 
 I'm tryna' make my partners a part of the election 
 So you ain't gotta presidential pardon me 
 And pardon me, but why is it that the darker must suffer? 
 How do we protect the culture from the vultures? 
 There's a Cold War every summer in the Chi 
 It's a snowball effect from the Cold War in Russia 
 But Vladimir Putin ain't in the hood recruitin' 
 And Derrick Rose ain't the only one out here shootin' 
 They set fire to their own squad cars 
 And a bitch on the news gon' blame it on the lootin' 
 Now here I am talking 'bout a revolution 
 And I can't even spare a dollar to the movement 
 But I'm in the strip club spending dollars on that movement 
 I guess we all got room for improvement 
 Rain or shine, it's all blue, it's all blue 
 Ain't no sun, it's all blue, it's all blue 
 Purple haze, in a daze, it's all blue, it's all blue 
 Change gon' come, it's all you, it's all on you 
 It's all blue, all blue 
 It's all blue, all blue 
 The skies stay gray, around my way, around my way
