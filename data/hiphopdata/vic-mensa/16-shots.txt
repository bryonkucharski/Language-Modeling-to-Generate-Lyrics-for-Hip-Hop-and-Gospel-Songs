Ready for the war we got our boots strapped 
 100 deep on State Street, where the troops at? 
 The mayor lying saying he didn't see the video footage 
 And everybody want to know where the truth at 
 On the South side where it's no trauma centers, but the most trauma 
 A lot of cannons but you don't want no drama 
 I can't imagine if it was my own mama 
 Got her first born son stole from her, he never had a chance 
 And we all know its 'cause he black 
 Shot 'em 16 times, how fucked up is that? 
 Now the police superintendent wanna double back 
 Cops speeding up to the block like a runnin' back 
 Tension is high, man these niggas is irate 
 You can see it in they eyes, they wanna violate 
 Screaming out "Oink! Oink! Bang! Bang! Gang! Gang! Gang! Gang! Murder! Murder!" 
 Murder they mind state 
 I just made me a mil' and still militant 
 This ain't conscious rap, this shit ignorant, nigga, hair trigger 
 Ain't no fun when the rabbit got the gun 
 When I cock back, police better run 
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, fuck 12 
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, fuck 12 
 16 shots 
 And we buckin' back 
 16 shots 
 16 shots 
 And we buckin' back 
 16 shots 
 They threw a little girl down on the pavement 
 Pushed her with the bike and said, "Stay out the way, bitch" 
 She was bleedin' on the ground through her braces 
 This is what happens when niggas don't stay in their places 
 The mayor duckin' when he fired the superintendent 
 But resignation come with bonuses and recognition 
 So we gon' break in the stores on Magnificent Mile 
 And if we gotta go, let's go to prison in style 
 Cops killin' kids and stayin' out of jail 
 But Bobby Shmurda can't even catch bail 
 So it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 
 Now I got everybody yellin' out, "Fuck 12" 
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, fuck 12 
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, fuck 12 
 16 shots 
 And we buckin' back 
 16 shots 
 16 shots 
 And we buckin' back 
 16 shots 
 There's a war on drugs, but the drugs keep winnin' 
 There's a war on guns, but the guns keep ringin' 
 Me and Lord got a clip with an extendo 
 And we rollin' with it, hangin' out the window 
 We on 16th ridin' by the police station 
 We might make a pork rind out of pig, bro 
 Somebody tell these mothafuckas keep they hands off me 
 I ain't a mothafuckin' slave, keep your chains off me 
 You better hope this 9 millimeter jam on me 
 Or get blown, I hope you got your body cam turnt on 
 Fuck a black cop too, that's the same fight 
 You got a badge, bitch, but you still ain't white 
 This for Laquan on sight, when you see Van Dyke 
 Tell him I don't bring a knife to a gunfight 
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, fuck 12 
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, fuck 12 
 16 shots 
 And we buckin' back 
 16 shots 
 16 shots 
 And we buckin' back 
 16 shots 
 There's a war on drugs, but the drugs keep winnin' 
 There's a war on guns, but the guns keep ringin' 
 Singin'

 The video shows Laquan walking southbound down the middle of Pulaksi. There are squad cars visible in front of him and also squad cars behind him. The shooter's squad car is visible as it drives past Laquan. Two officers then exit that vehicle with their guns drawn. At that point, Laquan begins to look away from the officers at a southwest angle toward the sidewalk. When Laquan is about 12 to 15 feet away from the officers, the width of an entire lane of the southbound traffic, one officer begins shooting. Laquan immediately spins to the ground and the video clearly shows that the officer continues to shoot Laquan, multiple times, as he lays in the street. 16 seconds pass from the time Laquan hits the ground until the last visible puff of smoke rises from his torso area. An officer then approaches Laquan, stands over him and appears to shout something as he kicks the knife out of his hand
