There's alot goin' on, but this the dynasty 
 The crazy man's keepin' me up, I'm not sleepin' 
 My fit too fresh to be doin' the housekeepin' 
 The maids cost too much, started cleanin' my own closet 
 Livin' childhood fantasies, dealin' with grown problems 
 Got a brand new bae, she keep me good like the music 
 If the Roc is here, throw up your diamonds and hood cubics 
 No I.D. said it's time to take these goofy niggas out rap 
 Drop bombs over Baghdad on these SoundCloud outcasts 
 I stray away to say the way my days would be without rap 
 My mind drifts to back before the Chi was labelled Chiraq 
 Then Chief Keef dropped in 2012, now it's a drill 
 I was waitin' in the wing like a bird on a windowsill 
 Now I'm the fresh prince, I think I know how my uncle feel 
 He sent this dope shit to my veins like fiends on any deal 
 After we build on existing structures, shift the culture 
 Like George Bush searchin' for weapons of mass destruction 
 Think I'm 'bout to blow! But this ain't the Middle East 
 This the midwest and we the royal family like Della Reese 
 SAVEMONEY the new dynasty like Death Row in '93 
 The same year my mother's water broke on 57th St 
 Mama Mensah knew she raised a very special man 
 Young Muhammad in the ring with the power in my hands 
 To defy the federation like Ali in Vietnam 
 The Roc is still alive, throw your diamonds up again 
 Yeah, I carry the Roc like a runnin' back, hundred miles and runnin' back 
 Hov the president, he flyin' private in Obama's jet 
 Vic the young hitta, I want it with any nigga 
 My problems' deeper than rap, ain't a problem to bury niggas 
 Cemetery diggers will be ready for your favorite rapper 
 Catch him stompin' in my yard, I step up like a Beta Kappa 
 I am nothin' like these actors, they're only on camera 
 I hit 'em in the head like Holly Holm hit Ronda 
 And my home is Rwanda, blood diamonds and minors 
 High school students with guns hidin' in their binder 
 Gotta wear a clear bookbag and wear a hood pass 
 Hit you from the blindside, that's a no look pass 
 Rookie season, Steve Nash, they are just my sons 
 Catchin' alley oops, catch 'em in the alley, oops 
 I heard a certain who's who mad that I like the danger 
 Get your priorities straight like Hermione Granger 
 Sixteen in the magazine and one in the chamber 
 Sneak it in the club, that's a club banger 
 This is not a diss song, this a disclaimer 
 Sorry that your management can't manage my anger 
 Violence is not the answer but, Lord, they done brought it to me 
 You gon' see a side of me, the South Side taught it to me 
 They gon' think I'm Akeem when I pull up and pull 
 A semi Uzi, auto, fully out the Robert Geller hoodie 
 Yeah, Pelle Pelle bloody, Motown Berry Gordy 
 With the shits, lavatory, tell a nurse, purgatory 
 Minimums is mandatory, crack sentencin' 
 Bad parentin', put his dad on Maury, just another classic story 
 I know there's no master for me, I don't even buy chains 
 I don't rock diamonds, I just need the Roc chain 
 I don't get high no more, I go high octane 
 They should call the rap game my name, this is my game, Vic! 
 To the police 
 You can not (You can not!) 
 You can not (You can not!) 
 You can not (You can not! 
 You will not (You will not!) 
 Kill me (Kill me!) 
 If you want justice, make some noise 
 Let's go
