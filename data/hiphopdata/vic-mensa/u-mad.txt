Ooh I don't need y'all either 
 Ooh don't wanna talk about it 
 Ooh like I don't, like I don't know nobody 
 Like I don't know nobody 
 I guess I don't 
 (Oh you mad, huh?) 
 (Oh you mad, huh?) 
 (Oh oh you mad, huh?) 
 Oh oh, she gon' be mad right? Ain't that too bad, right? 
 Wanna catch that cab, right? Take back that bag, right? 
 I guess that she just gon' go buy herself that purse 
 I'm back on my Chicago shit and this ain't what you want. Shout out to Lil Durk 
 I'm the villain, no really I'm just chillin' 
 Tryna stack these 20s, 50s, hundreds, millions, to the ceilin' 
 Mary, Mary all I need, pussy, money, weed 
 And all my women in doubles, I'm at the DoubleTree 
 All I hear hoes callin' out wildin', on the road like every day 
 We everywhere, any day and anywhere that the money say 
 No questions, no questions please, just on your knees 
 Blow, don't sneeze, bitch shut up, don't breathe 
 Gasp, on the gas, till I crash, autopsy said that nigga mashed 
 All praise to Allah, not Ramadan but these bitches fast 
 Fuck in the party, pull up her skirt, then skrr 
 Who her? I forgot her name 
 Ooh like I don't, like I don't know nobody 
 Ooh like I don't, like I don't know nobody 
 Ooh like, ooh like I don't know nobody 
 Like I don't know nobody, like I don't know nobody 
 (Oh you mad, huh?) 
 I guess I don't 
 (Oh you mad, huh?) 
 (Oh you mad, huh?) 
 (Oh oh you mad, huh?) 
 There go another lawsuit 
 In court so much, man I should've went to law school 
 Everybody brawlin', it was all cool 
 Till I hit the bartender with the bars-tool 
 I don't fuck with fake dudes wearin' fake trues 
 I just talked to 2 Chainz and he said, "tru" 
 I feel like MJ, I'm in his shoes 
 I'm talkin' Montell Jordan, this is how we do 
 Bust a nigga head and then I lay low 
 These niggas ass-water, get the Drano 
 She ain't really bad, she a photo thot 
 I should hire this bitch, she so damn good at Photoshop 
 That Lexapro got me drowsy than a heart attack 
 I think they finally think they got me where they want me at 
 I got seven hundred emails in my inbox 
 What that mean? I ain't callin' nobody back 
 Ooh like I don't, like I don't know nobody 
 Ooh like I don't, like I don't know nobody 
 Ooh like, ooh like I don't know nobody 
 Like I don't know nobody, like I don't know nobody 
 I guess I don't 
 (Oh you mad, huh?) 
 (Oh you mad, huh?) 
 (Oh oh you mad, huh?) 
 I be catchin' too many stares this evening, God fearin' but God knows I'm on a roll 
 At the Louvre in Paris, still be on the block like a corner store 
 Ain't my fault you ain't the man, made a plan, man it was planned 
 They sleeping on me like long flights, I pop a Xan on the way to France 
 Paparazzi like, "oh that's him!", pour that gin, let's get faded 
 Drinkin' like it's no tomorrow, what's today? I'm in the Matrix 
 Hater, please let me live my life, swear to God I be tryna do right 
 But if she bad I might hit a bitch in the elevator like Ray Rice 
 Uh, y'all pay the price, I pay the difference, it's just different 
 Save money, ain't nothin' different, gunshots and jumpin' fences 
 Hold on I'm tryna get loose, please don't get shit confused 
 Ask Don C, I've been lit, this 'Ye shit just lit the fuse 
 Now I'm on fire, everybody go quiet (sshhh) 
 Like where was you last week? My nigga the fuck was you hidin'? 
 Like I was laying on my arm I'm on my side 
 South side, I'm down to start a riot 
 Ooh like I don't, like I don't know nobody 
 Ooh like I don't, like I don't know nobody 
 Ooh like, ooh like I don't know nobody 
 Like I don't know nobody, like I don't know nobody 
 (Oh you mad, huh?) 
 I guess I don't 
 (Oh you mad, huh?) 
 (Oh you mad, huh?) 
 (Oh oh you mad, huh?)
