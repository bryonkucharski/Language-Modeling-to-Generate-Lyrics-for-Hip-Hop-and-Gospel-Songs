People often see me in jams, and be thinkin' I'm high 
 No that just be my lazy eye 
 What's your reply to the evidence against you 
 Your girlfriend found one hand just one loan credit 
 Exclaimed you was fuckin' you claim downtown 
 Where Fred can beat that, win that, quick nigga wins the ballgames 
 Tailwind nose is a must on any con any truck 
 When riding on luck you catch an empty 
 Riding on the wave is real good, suave bola 
 You be playin' the low low, while your girlfriend be like, "Oh no!" 
 I seen it with my own eyes and I know that it was him 
 Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned 
 Episodes of Free Willy bring strife in your life 
 You can flip and use the gift of gab, but don't waver 
 If you love your girlfriend, then you better save her 
 Cause the next man is eager, to run up in yours 
 Be in her drawers, put your girl on her fours 
 Sometime's the girls game's tighter than a sloppy ass nigga 
 I got my girl locked down hey that's the truth nigga 
 She gone away for the weekend, man she right uptown 
 Runnin' around with my man Boogie Brown 
 I keep your arms in the air, your feet on the floor 
 While you're over there frontin with these kids 
 Your girl's givin' jaw 
 I been doin' my own thing [x2] 
 Oh you got your own dough, from where I don't know 
 You hold degrees from two universities 
 Girl you're worth cheese in the nine-seis 
 Sadat owns apartment keys, is it Alize for Dolo 
 You got a mind on top of that spine plus the lump lump 
 Highly educated and highly motivated 
 Workin girl skirt tight love to hurt 
 What to exert, I break your next man's pocket 
 Smell of freak fragrant, unlike the vagrant 
 You can pay the rent always, and don't be gettin' hallways 
 In the bed girlie and at work by nine 
 Put on the work force ridin' on a iron horse 
 Bring it home to dad, the one piece 'cause I'm here 
 Workout baby doll and keep yo' career 
 No chiggedy, no diggedy, not you 
 Glad that I got you, when I did 
 Cause you was runnin' wild with this out of style kid, no class 
 Light in the ass, white enough to pass 
 Shotproof glass for the midnight mass 
 I have seen this chick at the bar, furiously she was searchin 
 She want to wet her whistle with the glass of bubbly 
 She want the Willie Dom not the cheap sherry 
 Tryin' to front with the outfit that's goin' back tomorrow 
 Now she's makin' me dream, if she played to force it 
 Dom she want to toss it, back in that 
 Jet when the bottle's gone and that's a fact 
 Give you the wrong number knowin' it's the wrong number 
 Front on a nigga never that, not I 
 If you see me at the bar it's dry throat 
 Because I'm keepin' these hoes dry 
 Hey lookie there there's Harlem Slim! 
 Lookin' at me, but then you're walkin' with him 
 I be a little old for them young girl games 
 I know a lot of tricks but I ain't namin no names 
 One burnt my man, left his beef in flames 
 Actin' ill wild like the untamed dames 
 Just came to mingle where I flowed the river Thames 
 When I was young in the clubs they played Cool James 
 Get rich without jail, is one of my aims 
 You remember Good Times, with courderoy jeans
