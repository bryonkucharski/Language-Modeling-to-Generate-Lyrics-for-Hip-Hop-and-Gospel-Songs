Yeah, yeah 
 Let's get it on 
 Don't sleep 'cause you might slip, yo [Chorus x8] 
 Shawn Black- 
 Eyes was gazin' as we came through blazin' 
 Honeys gamin', I caught this money maintaining, uh! 
 Now back to the problem that just occurred 
 Yo, you reap what you sew, peep my flow really dope, yo 
 The drug traffic, crack packin', Shawn Blackin' 
 Brother in the back, he with the nickel-plated Maxin' 
 Actin' as if, but son caught the 4/5th 
 Spittin' out clips, he's shootin' down with 6/6 
 Now went side the rooftop, I had 2 Glocks 
 My bitch had the out of town tickets right in the shoebox 
 Now we all settin' up shop with Pearl Drops 
 Connect our props, my click don't tickety-tock 
 Clientele, word is born, quite strong 
 With Black Shawn the bitch slid, with a stash of two bricks 
 I had to see you when we reached Connecticut 
 Now I jumped on the celly, bad feeling in my belly 
 That war broke I left the whole crib smelly 
 We all about ballin', yo you slip when you fuckin' fallin' 
 (Sadat X) 
 Hey yo, 2 bricks lost, that's a lot Black 
 Hey yo, I told you 'bout them ho's dick 
 Ho's will be the death of you 
 They'll lead you in ambush 
 And there won't be nothin' left of you 
 That's hard-earned, I ain't got no money to burn 
 Hey yo, where's this chick at? Uh-huh, For real get my money back 
 'Cause I don't give a fuck where she go or who she know 
 Just recover that, don't make me smother this witch 
 Ain't you with me Shawn Black?, don't you want to be rich? 
 'Cause I'm too old and it's too cold to pick 
 Outside hand-to-hand, I don't want to be the man 
 You understand? 
 For years, told him not to enough 
 Kids are gettin' football # 
 Thinkin' mad things, while a sleeping man slumbers 
 (Duo) 
 Ain't no trace, I guess murder is the case 
 Hey yo, honey look good so don't rock her in her face 
 I seen ya type of action in the discotecs and 
 She had this nigger from behind the speaker, you didn't peep her? 
 She smokin' reefer and drinkin' Harveys Bristol Cream 
 On the plate with the ice 
 I will entice the ho and then price the ho 
 And then grab my dough and leave his on the floor 
 No traces, cause rap stars can't change their faces, awwwhhhh 
 The faces and places have been slid to the rear 
 There's blown trees off the bridge 
 The convoy of cowboys with ther 
 Hey did we do our thing Black? 
 Yeah we put her in the smash 
 Now the 25th to the 30th precinct 
 Can't see us 'cause we move on basic instinct 
 They want to be us but that ass is just too stinky 
 What the hell they think would happen 
 Duck Down niggas is clappin' 
 It's lifeless and always does it trife trick 
 Out of my strip, everybody gotta represent 
 Forget a motorbike, I wanna lamp in a GS legit 
 So I can get that same bitch stressed 
 Yeah, yeah, the great Shawn Black and Sadat X... [More crew shoutouts]
