Bring it down... 
 As we proceed well dressed to get done 
 Live well, dress well to the day it's done [x2] 
 (Grand Puba) 
 Come here singing, check this 2 piece combo 
 Grand Puba, Dat X snatching Polly-o 
 Please, dig the way we grant this cheese 
 Looks a whole lot better wit a pocket full of cheddar (yeah) 
 We smacked this on the blizzard day we all remember 
 We stomp through wit Gortex and 3 ?guaded? timbers 
 So Ali, put them things to a halt 
 Get that rhythm so we can stack these papers in a ?boat? 
 No time for chicken when a nigga politicing 
 No time for sticking 'cause honey here is easy picking 
 I need to be straighter than gator 
 Catch a flashback and you can do me in the project elevator 
 It's no guessing when it comes to this session 
 Ah, it's no diggy, Ali hit us wit a blessing 
 Me and Sadat go back to the days of the sandbox 
 Now we much bigger, still laying nigga 
 We used to chase honies back then 
 Now all we chasing is decimals, Range Rovers and Mercedes Benz 
 850's and houses, no time for skirts and blouses 
 Bitch, back the fuk up of my trousers 
 (Sadat X) 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 Can you face success for the coming year 
 Drink jet, lay back and get your swiderve 
 Make the breadline wind way around the corner 
 I want all of my people to be rich so life wouldn't be such a bitch 
 The same way as it comes, I want my pockets filled wit lumps 
 Puba, you know me for 20 odd years 
 Let's raise our glasses in cheers, ?that was all our? careers 
 You know what, we goaling in since the days of old 
 My pockets been swoll yet unconsole 
 Never dwell, we live swell on the d-low 
 Raise the person now in you, getting wit the us and now 
 Alamo, if you hit me once mo' wit that 
 I'll return and burn, kill shit for the ages 
 Rip up the stages listed in the yellow pages 
 They better slow down wit that slander 
 I am the great Sadat X from New York state 
 And I rate much more than pretenders 
 I'm down wit mindbenders and the big moneyspenders, the big earners 
 There'll be no cross burners in this part of the grass 
 I'll be the first one to flip and run up wild in that ass 
 Bring it down... 
 (Sadat X) 
 Let bygones be bygones was last year's episode 
 This year I wanna explode wit the great paper caper 
 If the move is willing, should I not go for the killing 
 Freewheeling poses alot of death, wack rappers waste alot of breaths 
 The cognac is back in a mid size glass wit ice 
 I'm already nice, who got the dice 
 So let's roll, hold on, let me gain control 
 When you hear this jam, you can bet your last dollar 
 I was jack deep down born in a whole squalla 
 Hey Puba, speak to these people 
 (Grand Puba) 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, man, yo 
 My days is over playing Willie Cassanova 
 Used to fuk wit these bitches till I smacked up my Rover 
 Used to take the hoes to the hotel 
 If they wanted mo', used to take them to the motel 
 Shit was swell, in '96 though I be mad jell 
 'Cause if you play these niggaz out, they might go tell 
 And on that note, let's shake it to we all butt naked 
 Keep the crisp style flowing, 'Mo, keep the beat going 
 It's Grand Puba, Ali, Sadat and don't foget it 
 Make you happy like the day that OJ was acquitted 
 Yeah as we put it on like this, know I'm saying 
 Wild Cowboy, Grand Puba, Ali, [?]mow wow skow[?] 
 Black, Bird, Mark Da Spark, Stud Doogie, huh, yeah
