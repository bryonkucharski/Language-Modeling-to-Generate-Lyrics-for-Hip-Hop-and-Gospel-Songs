(?1) 
 A while ago, just want you to know 
 Just who you're listenin to (say whaaaaat?) 
 So listen let me tell you 
 Who I am, and what I do 
 (Chorus: Sadat X and ?2) 
 (Sadat X) 
 Check it out, the Wild C-O-W-B-O-Y's 
 (?2) 
 And we the capital M to the B's to the P's 
 (Together) 
 Money Boss and the Wild Cowboys, goin' down in history, well... 
 (Sadat X) 
 Makin' moves with my cats, it's the Money Boss Players 
 It don't pay to have money if you ain't stackin layers 
 When I say Wild Cowboys the name says it all 
 I'm like your favorite, tell your man whatchu wanna tell him 
 I run styles, stack piles, more than a thousand empty vials 
 The new rhyme era, makes me the New York terror 
 Bronx niggaz hold ya corner if it's your girl get up on her 
 And bodegas across the street, holdin' guns 
 (?3) 
 It's mad heat niggaz on the quest to get the riches 
 Fives threes or stitches 
 Dicin dumb bitches 
 Ridin' in the sixes, windows tinted 
 On the Rover, but now it's over 
 The cocaine game is now sober so move over 
 You're better off walkin' nowadays 'cause cars is coffins 
 So here lies New York for extortion and I'm off in 
 Any nigga in my path, fast you can ask 
 Big Guy, C-Deb, and Lord, Trey Bag, and Cheeba Don 
 (?4) 
 AIyyo if you didn't know I'm from the Boogie 
 Keep a hoodie and start a nigga 
 And flip a brick for the triple figures 
 It's the young cat, black push wigs facts and brackets 
 Bronx drug traffic, soldier heads wreak havoc 
 It's the SB, from the one-six-sluggy, but yo 
 I'm A-Solo with a pair of Peps and my Polo 
 Peep my flow so, the Mafioso sell coco 
 I'm chillin', prepared for all the snakes I might microwave 
 (Cheeba Don) 
 I keeps it low creepin', the cuban link peepin 
 I plays the back of the Ac, with the tints half cracked 
 Blowin' smoke thinkin', about BM's and rims 
 But my left and rights, ain't pushin nothin' but some Tims 
 Talkin' bout (Cheeba), you got flow yeah (Cheeba) 
 You got dough yeah bankrolls fly clothes yeah 
 Chickenheads, swearin, they Buttafouco 
 Just because they got a sixty dollar pair of Parasuco 
 (?6) 
 Well it's your franchise, I play Tims and BM's 
 Knots, twenties and tens, blacked-out P's with rims 
 I spring drops plus invest in spots 
 So I can float yachts, while my crew play the lot 
 Five hundred grand, me and my fam livin' flam 
 Money Boss comin' through, with the grand new Land 
 I play the back seater, me and Cheeba smokin' reefer 
 My crew got bricks, pushin sticks, lookin' sick 
 (?7) 
 Well bust the collaboration, the Cowboys and the Players 
 Money Boss from uptown to watch these Bronx niggaz lace this 
 Sadat pass that pot, twist up so we can rock 
 Get this louie and yo Mayor Rudy need to get popped 
 For any altercations, we bring the beef to the streets 
 That's word to mother, cause niggaz love the industry beef 
 MC's is plastic just like the glock they packin 
 Makin' noise with some Wild Cowboys but not from daps 
 (?8) 
 Aiyyo these prophets is makin' profits, street dimensions 
 Niggaz died to play BM suspensions 
 Niggaz minds is cluttered, ghetto blocks they stay flooded 
 Crack sales prevail, niggaz murdered for half a hundred 
 I live amongst players nigga these streets is ferocious 
 New York, New York - fuck screamin coastes kid 
 Fuhrealla, you ain't a killa till you killed the killa 
 The Uptown endorses, the Money Bosser 
 (Minnesota) 
 Listen, like a player got bad bitches, the feds got snitches 
 I play these streets for what they worth, BX my place of birth 
 Bronx New York, stop the bank, went out and thanks spendin mon 
 So fuck a bitch, hocus pocus watch this broke nigga turn rich 
 All you clown niggaz banned Money Boss sets the trends 
 False rehearsal, all your rhymes sound like a car commercial 
 Lay my shit down, world renowned, take your paper 
 Minnesota I'm that nigga talkin' trap with my Players 
 Money Boss and the, straight flossin the 
 The Cowboys in the, makin' noise in the 
 (X2 and variations to fade)
