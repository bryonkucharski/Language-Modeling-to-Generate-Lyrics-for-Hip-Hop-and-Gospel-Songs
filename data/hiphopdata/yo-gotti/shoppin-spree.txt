Left ring 10 hundred cash 
 Neck piece 30 grand 
 Whip cost 300 grand 
 God damn I'm on a shopping spree 
 Bracelet 20 bags 
 Rims cost me 5 grand 
 House cost 500 cash 
 God damn I'm on a shopping spree 
 (Soulja Boy) 
 Lying in a whip that don't release until 2010 
 50 thousand dollars spent just to make my rims spin 
 Half a million dollars spent on the house I live in 
 Even more spent on the seat I sit my ass in 
 Soulja boy tell 'em a.k.a the assassin 
 Prises cuts in my watch like I threw sum glass in 
 Damn exclusive shit sent from china 
 If you looking for me I'm probably in yo girls vagina 
 I'm looking in the mirror tell me who's finer 
 Bought a Lamborghini didn't need to cosigner 
 Hey what I spit is just minor 
 Every cut served soulja boys headliner 
 Damn now tell me you don't feel this 
 Hey you can't say I'm just one hit 
 Hey are you bitch niggas serious 
 I'm quick on track like fast and the furious 
 I'm on a shopping spree [Repeat: x6] 
 (Gucci Mane) 
 Chevy to a Chevy Chevy to a Lamborghini 
 You can't be me or see me unless you see me on TV 
 Shine and greezy I wonder Stevie Wonder can see me 
 Necklace a jungle of greed just check my selectional pieces 
 I got a stupid collection you see 
 Chain worth a millie you sill will a millie and 20 
 Uh man I pass out 50s an 20s 
 I pass out 50s an 20s I pass out 100s and 50s 
 We make more money than chemist, doctors, the lawyers, the dentist 
 Chemist the doctors the lawyers ye money together couldn't getcha 
 2 door Gurraro 160 
 Drop top 120 
 House worth a million and three dual trust 63 G's 
 Old schools a hundred a piece 
 That cost me 75 gs, 65 actually but my rims coast me ten of them things 
 Gucci yo gotti the king 
 Soulja done did it again 
 This team be 82gs that be worth 82 keys 
 (Yo Gotti) 
 Money ain't the option 
 Lets give you a option 
 You go to your stash partner an I'll come out my pockets 
 2 hundred hundreds 
 That like 20 grad 
 Just enough for me to buy my briden a new band 
 I'm like soulja boy tell me 
 They think that I'm playing 
 Come down her to Tennessee and see that I'm the man 
 Ain't talking 'bout no rapping 
 I'm talking bout that trapping 
 I'm talking bout that brick ill ram it straight up pistol package? 
 Ring piece 2000 grand 
 Neck piece 4000 grand 
 Fina cop Chevy but instead I went and coped a lamb 
 Whoa took yo bitch on a shopping spree 
 Gucci then Prada an I think they hoe in love with 
 Ain't got security I keep lots of thugs wit me 
 We call them goons 'cause I rock lots of jewelery 
 Cocaine everything

 Gun powder on the market 
 Realest nigga in the streets 
 I'm on a shopping spree [Repeat: x6]
