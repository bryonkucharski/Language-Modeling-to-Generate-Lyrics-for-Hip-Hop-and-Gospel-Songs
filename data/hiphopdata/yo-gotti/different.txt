 This little bullshit you doin' young nigga, my past history 
 Talking indictments I done duck those 
 Bricks I seen truckloads 
 Snootie Wild [?] I took Snootie where our shit go

 I hate when niggas compete with niggas out their league 
 Or niggas in their squad 
 You niggas act like broads 
 See I can tell pussy niggas when I see 'em 
 I can tell envious niggas when I see 'em 
 Ain't nothing worse than an ungrateful nigga though (namean') 
 How you real when you broke, but when you up you ain't 
 That mean you weren't real from the start, nigga (haha) 
 You niggas must remember money don't make you, heart do 
 We different
