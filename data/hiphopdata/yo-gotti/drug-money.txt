Drug money it's gonna buy you what you want 
 Drug money it's gonna buy you what you want 
 Drug money it's gonna buy you what you want 
 Drug money it's gonna buy you what you want 
 Fish scale, I'll buy you what you want 
 Thousand bill', I'll buy you what you want 
 A hundred square, I'll buy you what you want 
 Shoot it through the air, and buy you what you want 
 I got plug money, gotta ship it back in Mexico 
 Slot money make you shoot yourself like Plexico 
 Blood money, you fuck 'round, be the next to go 
 Oil money, I got tanks of gas like Texaco 
 Drug money, bitch, I'm running out of head spot 
 Shoe money, I had a hundred in a Nike box 
 Ho money, I took my bitch to ball in harbor 
 Watch money, what's a forty for a starter 
 In Mexico they're growing weed in the back yard 
 In Mexico get a pound, a couple one hundred, dawg 
 Exotic money, now I be riding in exotic cars 
 Switch my flow up just like future, now I got exotic bars 
 Drug money it's gonna buy you what you want 
 Drug money it's gonna buy you what you want 
 Drug money it's gonna buy you what you want 
 Drug money it's gonna buy you what you want 
 Fish scale, I'll buy you what you want 
 Thousand bill', I'll buy you what you want 
 A hundred square, I'll buy you what you want 
 Shoot it through the air, and buy you what you want 
 I got brick money, nine hundred for an ounce of yay 
 Streets dry, so nine hundred what they got to pay 
 Got a fifty in, got another fifty on the way 
 In magic city let the city know it's time to play 
 White whip, stainless steel, bitch, 300K 
 I ain't gotta rap, trap jumping I can stop today 
 Columbia, Colombians, I got 'em on the way 
 Lawyer paid more money if I get popped today 
 In Mexico my girl plugged when I was 16 
 In Mexico I was getting 'em for the 16 
 That's a lot of money, now I'm riding in exotic cars 
 Switched my flow up, changed my future, now I got exotic cars 
 Drug money it's gonna buy you what you want 
 Drug money it's gonna buy you what you want

 Drug money it's gonna buy you what you want 
 Fish scale, I'll buy you what you want 
 Thousand bill', I'll buy you what you want 
 A hundred square, I'll buy you what you want 
 Shoot it through the air, and buy you what you want
