Law #1: never underestimate the enemy 
 See this a very important law 
 Law 2: if a man show a flaw that mean that flaw really exist 
 Never take it for granted never 
 Rule #3: make sure you never break it never sleep where the sack at 
 I'm the hustler's constitution 
 Feds giving back time for retribution you snitching that shit excuses 
 Bang! that's execution and that's my only solution I got from stopping these rat niggas from moving 
 My life a movie not a short film 
 Big budget Denzel Washington, Will Smith yeah 
 Scarface, Al Pacino, Godfather, Marlon Brando 
 A word to the wise watch your guys niggas snakes in disguise 
 Meeting bitches off the gram know they living and lying 
 Cold heart never cried if I did it was blood 
 Little nigga big pride murder that's what it was and that's law 
 See if a nigga 
 See when you got that motherfuckin chip on your shoulder and that big ass pistol and a nigga come playing 
 You gotta show a nigga you mean business you know what I'm saying 
 I'm fighting pain, fame, I never want to change 
 I'm the same still running with the gang 
 Still down to kill a nigga about something petty like a chain [?] 
 You a million dollar nigga got to get that in your brain 
 Now get that in your brain, Bang it's all about the aim 
 We savages we all live the same 
 And it's the art of war nigga like the art of hustle nigga 
 They looking for the goonies but I'm the muscle nigga 
 Ima shooter like Durant 
 I got heart like Russell nigga 
 I lost a million to the plug I never trust another nigga 
 What if I sell a million records will that change the code 
 Will my niggas try to betray me 'cause I know they vultures 
 Will LA Reid see my vision, let me see them wrong [?] 
 Create me a better way to put my people on 
 Will my baby mama finally quit texting my phone 
 Kiss my daughter and my son tell 'em I'm coming home 
 Tell my niggas put the pistols down I'm in the zone 
 I been dropping nothing but gangsta shit on every song 
 This that shit they been waiting for forever long 
 They gave my patna 30 years for talking on the phone 
 I had to watch his mama cry and tell her let's be strong 
 Ima hold him down he won't do all that time alone 
 What if I wasn't a rapper the streets would get annoyed 
 Cause don't nobody tell it how I tell it and you know it 
 What if they say I changed 'cause I went outside the box 
 What's good I kept my plug number so I can get some blocks 
 18 wheeler full of cocaine I'm talking lots of dope 
 Not believing Mexican plugs fuck a horoscope 
 If you a star where your telescope 
 These niggas high they on hella dope 
 Your favorite rapper hella broke 
 Cars leases they got hella notes 
 Houses rented got eviction notes and everybody already know 
 You fabricated and I'm factionated 
 You sold a million records I got millions of dollars 
 Who really made it huh
