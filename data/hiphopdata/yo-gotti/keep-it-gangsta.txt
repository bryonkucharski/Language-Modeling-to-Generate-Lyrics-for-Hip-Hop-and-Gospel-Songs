(Intro: yo gotti) 
 What it do doc

 You know I'm affilliated with them aphiliates 
 And this is gangsta shit 
 (Hook: yo gotti)

 White tee, red hat, no flag

 (Verse: yo gotti) 
 I'm a gasta nigga, I got a gansta grill 
 A nigga signed with stunna got like a half of mill 
 Alot hating they don't wanna see a gangsta chill 
 But fuck it I'm a tell 'em how a gansta fill 
 I seek the industry fake, cause ain't no ganstas in it 
 But every motherfucker wanna play that gangsta image 
 Niggas rap about bricks then they get all excited 
 I rap bout dope 'cause I sold and pray I don't get endited 
 And I ain't throwing no signs, claiming no colors or shit 
 But got that p-90 rouger and it can get ugly in this bitch 
 My city watching my rearview, I'm speaking in codes 
 'Cause I'm a gansta & I stay in gangsta mode, 
 Look I'm a gansga

 Niggai'm a keep it gangsta

 (Verse: webbie) 
 Feast your eyes on a g, you surprised yeah it's me 
 Keep my eyes in the mirror, 4-5 on my seat 
 Ride mine on them feet, I can ride on any street 
 I ain't even gotta hide from a nigga 'cause I'm street 
 I'm a die up in these streets I got my mind made up 
 All my niggas k-ed up, ready for what for what ever come 
 Yeah a nigga getting money stunting ain't no thing to me 
 Dem hoes saw my phantom coming thougth I was jermaine dupree 
 Just hollered at my nigga b, I told it's time to roll 
 He told me nigga I know, I told him nigga let's go 
 Gangsta musik 2 let's give the streets thath on there 
 And I bet a million real niggas go get this bitch of the shelf 
 And bet lil niggas will love to, stop me and my lil thug to 
 Trill fenta lock it, bitch watch it me and my lil thug to 
 Everybody show us love, so us we just show them love to 
 You fuck with a busta, we bust him up, you get drugged to

 I spit this shit from the bottom of my stomach 
 So try some I knock the bottom out ya stomach

 In love with guns and he can't stop clubing, 
 Never could tell him nothing 
 Fuck real g's, with big nuts who flip keys on highways 
 Player made niggas, man who flip hoes off myspace 
 Luxery in driveways let your roof back nigga 
 That half of pill ain't doing the job, then throw ya two back nigga 
 My time to shine niggas playing, but I'm bout my bussines 
 Lats to drop, but off the top, the whole world know I'm the sickest, 
 Red monkey's to dickies, nigga got every color 
 From yo stae to 28, niggas got many hustles 
 My brothers the trill fam, love me because I'm loyal 
 Duke keep his shit straped, because my watch will get me kidnaped, from my block to yo trap 
 Niggas heads get bust, feds get dust 
 My trill niggas out here ready to bust
