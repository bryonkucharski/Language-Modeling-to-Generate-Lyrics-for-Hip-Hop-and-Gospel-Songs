 Okay, my bitch is a winner 
 Met the bitch in December 
 Real name was Keisha 
 Nickname was Criminal 
 Got a red bitch named July 
 Head fine, fireworks 
 Pussy special, head amazing 
 Looking for her, high alert 
 I'm a street nigga, one hunnid 
 And I love all of my bitches 
 I'mma get money, go hard 
 And ball all out with my bitches 
 I love thick hoes, light hoes 
 Black bitches, white hoes 
 Mixed bitches, ratchet hoes 
 Bougie bitches can't fuck with those 
 I like true freaks, chi hoes 
 I get money but don't buy hoes 
 That ass fat, gap wide 
 She can't stand straight she look pigeon toed 
 I fucked Tonya sister, Meeka cousin 
 Her best friend and her roommate 
 With y'all BFF y'all can tag team 
 And we call that shit a double date

 I love bad bitches is the problem 
 She gon' suck my dick until tomorrow 
 Spondivits eating calamari 
 I pay all the bills baby momma ain't worried 
 I'll fuck you bitch in a movie 
 Hardcore all on her booty 
 Rolex all on the old wrist 
 Her skirt going up on a Tuesday 
 Bitch just started in a chevy 
 Tryna do it big till I'm wealthy 
 Got a bookbag full of money 
 In the dealership take a selfie 
 All I used to whip was a Mazda 
 I used to have to pray for a thousand 
 Just bought a four floor house 
 Just to use the bitch for a closet 
 Love all them hoes then I move on 
 See my old neighborhood when the news on 
 Leave the club and head straight to the fucking crib 
 Till I fuck her on the futon

 I fell in love, first sight 
 Virgin pussy, super tight 
 She kinda insecure so she hold me tight 
 Attitude and one I kinda like 
 She be talking shit, like to fight 
 Last nigga ain't treat her right 
 So the last nigga ain't in her life 
 She listen to me so I give advice 
 I said, "you look good, that don't make you bad" 
 What's your greatest goal? 
 Who you fucked in the past? 
 What your future is? 
 What your plans are? 
 And most important now what you stand for? 
 A real nigga what you need to be planning for 
 Get money what you need a man for? 
 These lame ass niggas understand bruh 
 That ain't yo bitch if you paying her 
 A real nigga what you need to be planning for 
 Get money what you need a man for? 
 These lame ass niggas understand bruh 
 That ain't yo bitch if you paying her
