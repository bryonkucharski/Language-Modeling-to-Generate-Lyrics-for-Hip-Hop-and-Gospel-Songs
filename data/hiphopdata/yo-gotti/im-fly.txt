This gon' be the realest shit I ever wrote, 
 So just know it's deeper than rap 
 It was a lot of shit that go, but now I'm bringing it back 
 I been a G all of my life, and tried to hold it for the best 
 I'm the realest nigga living, they can write it when I rest 
 Fuck it put me with the best, and I can stand out on my own 
 It's survival of the truth, and I'll be coming for the throne 
 Fuck being a bigger man, niggas played the game wrong 
 So I played it how they played it, while remaining in my zone 
 These niggas hoes, that's why they keep my name in they mouth 
 It ain't hard to find me, bitch nigga I'm the streets of the South 
 And ain't no banging over wax, nigga come see me in the hood 
 In the section where fake is twisted, like the W in wood 
 I been repping since I was twelve, but now I'm 25 strong 
 With the family of A.B.N., running and toting some'ing chrome 
 I never trained to be in battle, even though I been at war 
 Mob made motherfucker, prolly leave you with a scar I'm the truth 
 This be the realest, the realest shit I ever wrote 
 This be the realest, the realest shit I ever spoke 
 All I know is (this gon' be the realest shit I ever wrote) 
 All I know is, that I'm gon' be the truth 
 They better know I peep everything in the game, 
 They got me looking at my life different 
 Niggas out here thinking they can know it, if my vibe different 
 These other niggas out here falsified, telling lies 
 Sell a couple records, now they profitized keep it real 
 You niggas ain't got the credibility, to be the truth 
 Unless you out here living what you talking, in the booth 
 Everyday it be the same, niggas know I'm in the lane 
 Only fucking with the killers, 'cause we feel each other pain 
 I hit the highway with my niggas, never toching the caine 
 Now they got me watching for the FEDs, bitches mention my name 
 Since I'm the leader of the gang, it make it hard for me to move 
 I'm the truth, it ain't gon' be a pretty sight for me to lose 
 Trae bail on street shit, got it on a lock 
 Every time I'm going off, niggas done got it on the block 
 Never something that it's not, I only know of being Trae 
 And that's the truth every motherfucking day, it ain't no other way 
 Niggas saying I got the name to be the truth, and I ain't even mad at 'em 
 But that expression on they face, had me taking jabs at 'em 
 This a warning shot, ever seen a nigga at his last 
 If you haven't, I advise you let this motherfucker pass 
 I ain't here to be mistaken, so respect it when I spit it 
 Fuck it keep it yourself, 'cause anyone of you's will get it 
 I'm a Asshole, and it's self explained by the anger 
 And I'm holding on a glock, that's keeping one up in the chamber 
 I'ma strut it like a gangsta, so my niggas get they bang on 
 Hopping out the slab, Dickies sagging with my chains on 
 Hopping fly, 'cause they seen the dropper with them thangs on 
 Lord knows, Trae'll leave them niggas with they brains blown 
 I'm in another zone, niggas still on cloud nine 
 And I'm a loner, you niggas don't need to crowd mine 
 Trae the Truth is what it is, niggas know it's time 
 Plus I'm here to make 'em lay it down, 'fore I spray it down 
 The truth be the realest shit I ever spoke, 
 Be the realest shit I ever wrote 
 (This gon' be the realest shit I ever wrote) 
 Be the realest shit I ever spoke, 
 Be the realest shit I ever wrote, 
 Be the realest shit I ever spoke, 
 Be the realest shit I ever wrote 
 This be the realest shit, I ever spoke 
 Even if they never see it, 
 This gon' be the realest shit I ever wrote 
 Pay attention, to the shit I quote 
 Even if they never hear it, 
 This gon' be the realest shit I ever spoke, 
 Even if they never hear it, 
 This gon' be the realest shit I ever spoke 
 One hundred percent real, one hundred percent real 
 Hey, Trae let 'em know ooh 
 This be the realest shit, that I ever spoke and wrote 
 This is the truth, hey
