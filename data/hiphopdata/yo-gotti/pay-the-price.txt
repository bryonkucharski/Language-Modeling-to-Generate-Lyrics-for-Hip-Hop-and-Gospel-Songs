Yeah 
 Bills due on the kitchen table 
 Mama walked past 'em 'cause she ain't able 
 Watching mama's family sister tryna watch cartoons motherfucker came through and clipped the cable 
 Get a job that's the usual 
 Mama had a job that ain't do enough 
 Mama hired me I'm sacking groceries up 
 90 days later I was posting up 
 Quarter pound of weed 250 strong 
 Staying out late bringing profit home 
 It's me and Big G tryna stack it up 
 Shit ain't been the same since my nigga gone 
 I looked up to niggas like Hookshot 
 Niggas like Lil Pat and Woo Woo 
 I was on the block as a young boy 
 Watching them hustle it was like school 
 I hustled with the greats, ate with the vultures and the snakes 
 My days turned to nights my nights turned to days 
 Streets got me paid 
 And I know Ima pay the price for it 
 I know it 
 One day Ima pay the price for it 
 I know it 
 I know it 
 I know it 
 First time I seen 10 bands 
 First time I seen 100 grand 
 First time I seen 1 mill 
 I knew shit was about to get real 
 Homeboys start acting different 
 Shit changed I ain't even tripping 
 Same nigga used to ride for 'em one time I was on the front line for em 
 I was a hitta for a dopeboy 
 Play crazy yeah you know boy 
 I'm in the hood with the doors up 
 Nigga I ain't never froze up 
 Bad bitches chose up 
 They like me or the lifestyle 
 Nigga I don't really give a fuck 
 But Ima burn the head in a meanwhile 
 I hustled with the greats, ate with the vultures and the snakes 
 My days turned to nights my nights turned to days 
 Streets got me paid 
 And I know Ima pay the price for it 
 I know it 
 One day Ima pay the price for it 
 I know it 
 I know it 
 I know it 
 Shit different you ain't even notice it 
 All the hustlers I ain't even quote it 
 New Wraith I ain't even rode it 
 Nick got a strap he ain't even load it 
 Shit real growing up in the projects 
 Tryna stay real in the process 
 Seen a pump knock out a nigga intestines 
 Young boy standing there tryna digest it 
 Where all the real niggas at that's my question 
 Never got indicted that's my blessing 
 When I put it on the Gram that's the motivate you 
 Inspiration nigga that's not flexing 
 New Lambs, new Raris 
 Little homie fighting charges 
 Make bond get 'em lawyers 
 Green dot so they can call you 
 I hustled with the greats, ate with the vultures and the snakes 
 My days turned to nights my nights turned to days 
 Streets got me paid 
 And I know Ima pay the price for it 
 I know it 
 One day Ima pay the price for it 
 I know it 
 I know it 
 I know it
