The difference between a pimp and a street nigga dog 
 Is a pimp nigga work his bitch 
 A trapper work the trap, a pimp work the track 
 But a street nigga works his wrist 
 (4x) 
 Work ya wrist then, well work ya wrist then 
 I get my wrist game on cause my wrist game strong 
 And my wrist flexible like I broke my wrist bone 
 I got muscles in my wrist, cause the 4 touched the pad 
 I can't count every play I use different rubber bands 
 Red means 30 stacks blue means 10 packs 
 When I say Imma skreet nigga bitch I mean that 
 Hold up, Hold up, this shit won't cake up 
 80 thousand dollar profits so I bought a Jacob 
 Yeah, yeah that's my favorite word 
 Hit a plug with the herb and connected with the bird 
 He hurt he know homey where ya been dog? 
 Ain't no sense in callin' Gucci less yer buying 10 dog 
 I crossed 10 state lines just to bring the pack here 
 Go'n fill ya W-2s out 'cause I'm taxin' 
 I'll pay for that ass I ain't never been a mack 
 But ya front me a pack, I'll bring that money back 
 Gotta stay fresh, all white tee 
 Dark Gucci lokez so the boy can't see 
 Triple beam scales, 5 for the pound, 12 for the Q-P, it's goin' down 
 Yeah, and I'm sick wit it I got major cake 
 And I blow 50 Gs on a rainy day 
 I got hard white, I'm with Gucci Mane 
 We fuckin' 50 hoes 'cause they some Gucci fans 
 There's a stack dirty, there's a plaque dirty 
 His jeans cut and his slacks dirty 
 Blowin' bubble gum, we gettin' blew down 
 Like it's Mardi Gras, we got the top down 
 Imma chef too, name Dough Boy 
 Call me Boston, Georgia, or just blow boy 
 Fucked a bitch who's gettin' stacked 
 Keep it moving less you movin' this pack 
 Whatcha say Gucci? 
 I was thinking out loud 
 Bout what? 
 Sellin whole better break the shit down 
 Sackin Gary Payton I was gonna buy T-O 
 Sat 24, a whole, 80 country "Whoa-flow" 
 I got 30 bricks sold add 60 mounds of gold 
 I'm the same way in case yer baby mobile wanna snow 
 D-boy swag mane, shawty that's what I got 
 Got that Larry Bird yay, and it's jumpin' out the pot 
 You be down motherfucker cause you know I'm too hot 
 Sick wrist game dawg I ain't talkin' bout my watch 
 Want a chain like mine, but ya can't afford the price 
 You can call me frigidaire because I pack a lotta ice 
 You can spin the world like the Earth on it's axis 
 I'm gainin' wait dawg just like a fat bitch 
 Gotta mean with some pea, wanna learn just watch 
 Nigga, red stop sign nigga roll kush stop
