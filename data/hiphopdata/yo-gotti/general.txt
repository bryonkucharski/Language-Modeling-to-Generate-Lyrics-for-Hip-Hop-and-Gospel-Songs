 Medusa heads, they're Versace 
 I'm rich from sellin' dope so I cannot be illuminati 
 My nigga 18 and he just caught him a body 
 First I made his bond then I bought him a Maserati 
 Congrats

 Ain't no brag in bossin', I caught the wave on 'em

 Step in the kitchen, it's woo 
 Strap with that carbon, it's woo

 If you can't fuck no pop star you a scrub 
 Freebandz
