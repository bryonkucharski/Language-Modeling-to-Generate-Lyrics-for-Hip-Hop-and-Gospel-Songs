 Baking soda on the counter 
 J's at the door 
 I got bails in the attic 
 Money in the floor 
 Brown bag, back and forth like a grocery store 
 Plastic bags, in and out and that shit filled with dope 
 Baking soda on the counter 
 J's at the door 
 I got bails in the attic 
 Money in the floor 
 Brown bag, back and forth like a grocery store 
 Plastic bags, back and forth and that shit filled with dope 
 Yo 
 Ain't no credit when you shop with me 
 You want some credit, leave your car with me 
 I tell my bitch she gon' go far with me 
 But she may have to take a charge for me 
 Baking soda in the 'fridgerator 
 I got money, that shit come with haters 
 What you want, what you need 
 I got pounds, I got keys 
 I got Goyard, that's a bag 
 Go hard for the bag 
 I got no heart, I'm heartless 
 For the bag, I'm retarded 
 Birkin bag with the crocodile 
 Yeah my bitch been around 
 I gave my bitch a real bag 
 I got faith she gon' hold it down 
 Baking soda on the counter 
 J's at the door 
 I got bails in the attic 
 Money in the floor

 Plastic bags, in and out and that shit filled with dope 
 Baking soda on the counter

 Yo 
 Why the trap smell like onions 
 What's that loud odor 
 I've been sackin' brown bags like I work at Kroger 
 Not concerned with no payment nigga, what the total 
 I jumped out my Bentley coupe into a Toyota 
 Seatbelt, rental car trafficking 
 Blood on my diamonds, bitch I'm African 
 Quit puttin' your bag on that 'gram, boy that real life 
 You'll have them feds and them robbers at you, real life 
 I put my money in the ground and molded 
 Put my trust in a nigga and he folded 
 Can't believe that nigga took the stand and told 
 Fuck your bitch in the trap [?]
