 When you get a check like this that'll put a smile on your face 
 When you got a wrist like this that'll put a frown on they face 
 When you ball hard like me they gonna call a foul on the play 
 Shit that they smoking too quiet so I got the loud on the way 
 Shit that I'm rocking in the club, boy I spent a bag on a swag 
 Shit that I'm drinking in the club, that was 10 thousand a case 
 If you see a hater with a frown on 'em 
 Turn it upside down on 'em 
 Hashtag pound put the pound on 'em 
 He a pussy it's going down on 'em 
 100 round drum in the case I'll put a child in his place 
 Walk around with 100k and won't give your bitch the time of the day

 Hi hater 
 Popping bottles standing on tables 
 Sparkles in the air celebration 
 We just tryna dab to the paper, dab to the paper 
 Smile on my bitches, smile on my peers 
 Smile on my face walking in the crib 
 Frowns on my haters when they see the crib you should see they face when they see the whip 
 I can put a smile on your face that's all jokes to the side 
 And nigga put a frown on your face some shit you just can't hide 
 Let me put my hand on your waist 
 Pull your hair and hit it from behind 
 I bet that put a smile on your face 
 Bet that put a smile on your face 
 Heard you got a job that you hate 
 Heard you got some bills that's late 
 Heard you got a nigga you can't shake 
 Heard you got a friend that's fake 
 Girl you need a thug in your life 
 Girl I need a plug in my life 
 I never had love in my life 
 I was busy selling drugs all my life
