(Yo Gotti) 
 Ay Gotti, what you gon' do homie 
 You gon' swap it up, slang it out? 
 You gon' keep it street? 
 What you gon' do, nigga? 
 Nigga I'ma re-up, fuck you mean, nigga? 
 Tell Enrique send my shit to Mexico 
 I don't even wanna see it 
 (Yo Gotti) 
 I don't know another nigga that had done it 
 Can't remember last time I got fronted 
 And the watch that I'm rockin' is a hunnid 
 Man the streets everyday, I'm a hunnid 
 If you really want beef, we can run it 
 Pull up on the squad, we dumpin' 
 Ran off on the plug with a hunnid 
 Got the motherfuckin' trap house jumpin' 
 (Yo Gotti) 
 Boy, I'm really in the trap, I'm always strapped 
 Truth be told, I don't really like to rap 
 I got quarter halves a slab, pill percs and tabs 
 Really got a pound runnin' laps 
 Bitch I'm in the hood, really, really, really in the hood 
 Niggas like, "Gotti, what's good?" 
 The coupe two hunnid, nigga, I be fuckin' up the money 
 And the drum really hold like a hunnid 
 I don't know another nigga that done it 
 Can't remember last time I got fronted 
 Yeah, I remember last time I got fronted 
 I was like, "Fuck the plug," I ain't bring back the money 
 I ain't savin' no hoes, it ain't Sunday 
 Know the alphabet boys, they comin' 
 I blew a 10 at the mall and a 10 at Kamal's 
 And a 20 at Magic last Monday 
 Every weekend I'ma sell a hunnid 
 Plant a money tree and I'ma be up under it 
 3 mil' for the condo, new marble floors 
 And the motherfucker ran like a hunnid 
 (Yo Gotti) 
 I don't know another nigga that had done it 
 Can't remember last time I got fronted 
 And the watch that I'm rockin' is a hunnid 
 Man, the streets everyday, I'm a hunnid 
 If you really want beef, we can run it 
 Pull up on the squad, we dumpin' 
 Ran off on the plug with a hunnid 
 Got the motherfuckin' trap house jumpin' 
 (Pusha T) 
 Aye Gotti, while we're talkin' 'bout a hunnid 
 With some niggas who ain't done it 
 That's 45 keys on a calibrated scale, bitch countin' on her stomach 
 If you checkin' the math, countin' on your fingers to add 
 We don't count extras when it's like Tetris 
 Yuugh, let me dummy down my lecture 
 Digest, these watches got sister, cousins 
 My Rollies got missin' numbers 
 These bezels is blindin' 
 The 3 and the 9 is like distant lovers 
 Now guess what I fronted, nigga (take a guess) 
 Keef said 300, nigga (double that) 
 I say about 5, I kept it alive whenever you want it, nigga 
 Maseratis for the monkeys (fuck them niggas) 
 Any Dodge for a flunkie 
 Only one above me is the God in the sky 
 I'm a man without a country 
 (Yo Gotti) 
 I don't know another nigga that had done it 
 Can't remember last time I got fronted 
 And the watch that I'm rockin' is a hunnid 
 Man, the streets everyday, I'm a hunnid 
 If you really want beef, we can run it 
 Pull up on the squad, we dumpin' 
 Ran off on the plug with a hunnid 
 Got the motherfuckin' trap house jumpin' 
 (Yo Gotti) 
 I got a hunnid guns, hunnid clips 
 Swear to God I took a hunnid trips 
 Million dollars, that's a hunnid flips 
 [?] at a hunnid rip 
 A hunnid grams on the kitchen table 
 Tryna hide a hunnid pounds from my nosy neighbors 
 I got a hunnid problems but it ain't no hoes 
 I got a hunnid robbers tryna take my soul 
 I know a hunnid ways to make a hunnid thou 
 We done skipped public housing 
 Where I shot my first pistol at 
 Gotta thank God I made today 
 I never joined no gang, I always got my money 
 I never crossed my partners, cause it ain't one hunnid 
 I sold dope on Saturday then went to church on Sunday 
 Call my plug and re-upped on Monday 
 (Yo Gotti) 
 I don't know another nigga that had done it 
 Can't remember last time I got fronted 
 And the watch that I'm rockin' is a hunnid 
 Man, the streets everyday, I'm a hunnid 
 If you really want beef, we can run it 
 Pull up on the squad, we dumpin' 
 Ran off on the plug with a hunnid 
 Got the motherfuckin' trap house jumpin'
