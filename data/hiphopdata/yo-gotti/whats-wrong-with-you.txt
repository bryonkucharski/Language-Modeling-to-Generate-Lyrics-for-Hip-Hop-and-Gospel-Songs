 Sitting home pissed, like shit, with the long face

 Landlord, kush and patron go have her hella high 
 Her homegirl ain't sayin' shit, her homegirl her alibi

 Yo bitch done got toss around, left her in the lost and found 
 Heard that she was feelin' me, then you started talkin' down 
 That just made it easier, that it make her curious 
 She said you don't give her space and me I don't give a fuck 
 She on the two, bitch told me everything she goin' threw 
 She goin' to, goin' to, details you wouldn't know was true 
 Lets just say we have an understanding, I can't withhold the truth 
 She gets on dro, and lose it and puts head on the whole crew, damn 
 That bitch played it cold, she just wanna stay though 
 And fuck with some real niggas, and she know anything go 
 Why you think we call 'em hoes, 'cause they hoes 
 These bitches out here change niggas more than they change clothes
