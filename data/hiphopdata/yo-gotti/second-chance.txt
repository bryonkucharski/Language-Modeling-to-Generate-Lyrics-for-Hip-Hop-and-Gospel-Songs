Baby mama left a nigga, got another man 
 Didn't work out try to come back and geta second chance 
 Second chance, second chance 
 Yeah I love that ass to death but ain't no second chance 
 If I fucked off with your friend 
 Would I get a second chance? 
 Guess I fuck too many hoes I need a second chance 
 Second chance, second chance 
 She may love your ass to death but ain't no second chance 
 See bitches think they slick but then they act like niggas 
 Gon fuck off and then come back and act all sentimental 
 (Bitch!) 
 Pack your bags get out my house you know the bizz, 
 And you better not have no nigga round my fucking kids 
 See loyalty's a must and trust is all we have 
 And I'm a street nigga so you know the math 
 Don't put me in no shit cause you know what I will do 
 And if a nigga know my business I may have to kill you 
 Street code, freak home, fuck a bitch, anything goes 
 I think I fuck too many hoes, it's karma maybe 
 Finally got the one I like and she gon drive me crazy 
 It goes once upon a time, I was on my grind 
 Yeah I fucked a couple hoes 
 Yeah she caught a nigga lying 
 Then I went out on the road, 
 Then she want to pay me back, 
 So she fucked another nigga, 
 When I get back I'm a kill her (damn) 
 Gave that hoe the world, she had my lil girl, 
 Got a nigga hot, put me on the spot (damn) 
 Guess that's what I get get 
 Nigga round my bitch bitch 
 One thing 'bout it though we never working out shit bitch 
 I don't need no counselor, I'm the type to cancel her 
 Used to buy her cars and louie bags and shit to pamper her 
 I guess I fuck too many hoes, 
 It's come on maybe 
 Finally got the one I like 
 And she gon drive me crazy
