When I think about you, I think hoe! 
 When I dream about you, I think hoe! 
 It only took me some hours to hit, I think hoe! 
 When I see you at my niggas crib, I think hoe! 
 When you pull up in your whip, I think hoe! 
 Act different when you get your chips, I think hoe! 
 Wouldn't do it for your homies, do it for your bitch, hoe! 
 Hoe! 
 These hoes only fucking with a nigga, with them figgas 
 You ain't got it, them bitches ain't fucking with you 
 Stop saving these hoes, fuck these bitches 
 Stop bringing them around a real nigga 
 'Cause a hoe gon' be a hoe, and a bitch gon' be a bitch 
 Don't put your dick up in a hoe that make you money 
 And these hoes fucking different niggas every night 
 But she still be up in church every Sunday 
 So bitch, tell the DJ play my shit 
 And tell your home girls to get with it 
 Don't be ashamed to be a hoe, if you a hoe, then let them know 
 You getting money and they need to fuck with it 
 When I think about you, I think hoe! 
 When I dream about you, I think hoe! 
 It only took me some hours to hit, I think hoe! 
 When I see you at my niggas crib, I think hoe! 
 When you pull up in your whip, I think hoe! 
 Act different when you get your chips, I think hoe! 
 Wouldn't do it for your homies, do it for your bitch, hoe! 
 Hoe! 
 When I wake up in the morning, I think dough 
 Bad bitch, follow all the rap niggas, she a ho 
 Got a 100 thousand likes and a million something followers 
 I'm a street nigga, I'm just tryna get my dollars up 
 Kirko Bangz and my nigga YG 
 Yo Gotti, trill nigga, ask your hoe about me 
 Real Nigga shit, don't do that, get your feelings hurt 
 Want a red bitch in a mini skirt 
 Chanel boots, Celine purse 
 Shawty not a stripper but can make it twerk 
 When you think about me you think bread 
 When I think about you, I think head 
 When I think about you, I think hoe! 
 When I dream about you, I think hoe! 
 It only took me some hours to hit, I think hoe! 
 When I see you at my niggas crib, I think hoe! 
 When you pull up in your whip, I think hoe! 
 Act different when you get your chips, I think hoe! 
 Wouldn't do it for your homies, do it for your bitch, hoe! 
 Hoe! 
 These hoes gon' be hoes 
 You cuffin' and loving her, but she fucking on the low 
 And I'm like "damn", bitch, what you saying? 
 Hoe, you know you got a man 
 But she gon' fuck all the niggas, that all the bitches is fucking 
 And she gon' post all them pictures that she don't look like in public 
 She gon' be in the club, bottles poppin', she boppin' 
 When the sparkles start coming, bitches start table hoppin' 
 They see me when I'm coming down, ridin' slow 
 You ain't a hoe, why you fucking on the floor 
 You and your girlfriend wear each other clothes 
 Bitch we don't save these hoe's 
 When I think about you, I think hoe! 
 When I dream about you, I think hoe! 
 It only took me some hours to hit, I think hoe! 
 When I see you at my niggas crib, I think hoe! 
 When you pull up in your whip, I think hoe! 
 Act different when you get your chips, I think hoe! 
 Wouldn't do it for your homies, do it for your bitch, hoe! 
 Hoe!
