I believe I can fly fly fly 
 I believe I can fly fly fly 
 I'm so high 
 I'm so high 
 I'm so high 
 I'm so high 
 I believe I can fly fly fly 
 I believe I can fly fly fly 
 I'm so high 
 I'm so high 
 I'm so high 
 I'm so high 
 I Believe I can fly 
 Aye Aye Aye 
 Bitch I'm sittin' so high, I believe I can fly 
 The coupe looks delicious the rims are waving bye 
 ? Long like Diddy, I put on for my city 
 Cologne Kush and Henny, I'm gone in that Hemi 
 I'm gold but you don't hear me, four to the dome if you can hear me 
 They say I need a pull-up when I pull up I'm the shit man 
 When I grow up I wanna be like t-pain a hit man 
 But do yourself a favor partna don't be talkin' shit man 
 Your broad done up and broke your heart my whole squad hit man 
 Hold up I see dead people, its just the dead white guys on my bread people 
 I'm high as the moon and I'm flyer than a mosquito 
 Stacking my chips I got a bank full of Doritos 
 I'm too cool for school so I'm teaching a class 
 Chiefin' on that purple rain partna puff puff pass 
 See I'm higher than the price of gas gone off vanilla cream 
 Rolling off of mac Dre leaning like a triple beam 
 I got my wrist froze up like computer screens 
 So fresh so clean exhale sticky green 
 I got the top steady droppin' like record sales 
 Paint changing colors like Tyra bank's finger nails 
 Choose the fast life I'm the flashy type 
 Diamonds in my mouth sparkle look like sprite 
 I'm so high 
 I believe I can lean spite and codeine 
 Someone's sleeping on the scene 
 That's a hell of a dream I'm a hell of a guy 
 That's a hell of a blunt fire it up let's get high 
 You can call me g5 'cause I be in the clouds 
 Somewhere in the club with my clothes smelling loud 
 And never will I smile 'cause I be biting down 
 Rollin' off a p probably muggin' with a frown 
 But naw ain't nothing wrong how could he be on rich 
 Bitch looked at my whip bitch looked at my wrist 
 My wrist is tricked in ice my neck is dripped in ice 
 Bitch look at my life don't you wanna be my wife? 
 Would you like to be my girl? don't you wanna change your life? 
 I can change your life grab the credit card and swipe, like see? 
 Fly fly fly
