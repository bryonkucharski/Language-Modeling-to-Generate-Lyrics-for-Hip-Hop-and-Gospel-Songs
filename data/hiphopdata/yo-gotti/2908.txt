 2908 apartment 4, I remember 
 We were trappin' in and out the door, I remember 
 Miss Shirley's house breakin' down them things, I remember 
 I used to serve my partner momma, she's a crack fiend 
 Damn I remember

 I ain't know no better my nigga, I apologize for that 
 Damn

 I ain't realize homie

 Everything we monetize, homie 
 Your little brother like my brother 
 It left him traumatized, homie 
 And you my nigga 
 You were down to do a homicide for me 
 It's that hood shit 
 We was on Woodcliff with them choppas 
 OCU and undercover narcos tryin' to stop us 
 Signed my first deal, focus did some good 
 Still, I put 100,000 worth of guns in the hood, I remember 
 They couldn't tell us shit nigga 
 We were ready to go to war with whoever 
 That's when we came up with Ridgecrest Afghanistans

 Same street I shot my first pistol 
 Big G, damn I miss you nigga 
 Lil' Tweety, damn we miss you nigga 
 Look at me, we never envisioned this 
 If I crossed you on the way I never intended it 
 If I rob you I did it purposely 
 Still thinkin' 'bout niggas murkin' me 
 Dirty money we washed that shit in the laundromat 
 We were trappin' on the [?] bought a hundred MACs 
 You shot at us, you know we shot back 
 I'm from Ridgecrest, they say I don't know how to act 
 I apologize 
 Not for my actions, I was trappin' 
 I was tryin' to feed my family before I was rappin' 
 My first charge attempted murder and kidnapping 
 Now he sorry ask the victim what had happened

 I got keys to the city 
 Wanna know a secret 
 I had keys in the city before the keys to the city 
 So how the fuck the landlord think he gon' ban me 
 Fell out with real hittas from the hood, niggas couldn't ban me 
 'Cause my only plan b is death before I be a pussy 
 And throw this shit away before I let a nigga push me 
 Extort who? I wish you niggas knew 
 I ain't even fuckin' with you if you need to check to shoot 
 Ha, and take a chain from who? 
 Thirty million dollar, niggas just got something to prove 
 And if they mob they mob and that's what it was 
 But I watched these young niggas grow up, that's why it's love
