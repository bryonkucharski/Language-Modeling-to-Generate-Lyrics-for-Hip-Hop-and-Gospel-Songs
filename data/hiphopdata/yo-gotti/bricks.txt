(Intro-Yo Gotti) 
 It's ya boy yo gotti 
 Chea 
 Gucci mane the flare 
 My nigga Ralph in here 
 Zaytoven on the beat nigga 
 And it's a street nigga holiday 
 My Nigga D.J Holiday 
 Chea 
 [Chorus-Gucci Mane} 
 Bricks 
 All white bricks 
 Off white bricks 
 Light tan bricks 
 Just hit a lick, For 50 more bricks 
 Balling like a bitch, with all these bricks 
 Bricks 
 36 zips 
 That's a whole chick 
 Wanna bad bitch? Gotta have bricks 
 Yeah that make sense 
 Yeah I make hits 
 But I still take bricks 
 (Verse 1-Gucci mane) 
 So icy c.e.o, I'm a fool with the snow 
 They think I'm puttin' v.v.s jewels in the coke 
 My watch a cool hundred, Paint-job a cold 20 
 And after this flip I'm quittin' the trap cold turkey, Sike! 
 The pack in and I'm workin' 
 Drought season in, charged ya ass a whole 30 
 But right now you can get it for a low number 
 The fish scale white, Same color my hummer 
 Zone 6 polar bears never see summer 
 It's winter all year 'cause the birds fly under 
 95' Air Max 'cause I'm a dope runna' 
 I'm ballin' like an athlete but got no jumper I'ts 
 [Chorus-Gucci Mane} 
 Bricks 
 All white bricks 
 Off white bricks 
 Light tan bricks 
 Just hit a lick 
 For 50 more bricks 
 Balling like a bitch, with all these bricks 
 Bricks 
 36 zips 
 That's a whole chick 
 Wanna bad bitch? Gotta have bricks 
 Yeah that make sense 
 Yeah I make hits 
 But I still take bricks 
 (Verse 2-Young Ralph) 
 I'm like a waitress in the trap I got somethin' to serve 
 That's 16 bars, Same price for a bird 
 What you need a bird? 
 Or A Couple Pounds? 
 I'm on Cleveland Ave, You know my side of town 
 So many bricks I can build my own apartment 
 Ya better a check, When ya come in my department 
 Yes I break em' down 
 And I sell em' whole, Try me watch ya whole crew fall like some dominoes 
 I got a trap house 
 And a trap car 
 100,00 off a cap, That's a trap star 
 All this smoke got me feelin' real nauseous 
 Ridin' with them bricks got me feelin' real cautious 
 [Chorus-Gucci Mane} 
 Bricks 
 All white bricks 
 Off white bricks 
 Light tan bricks 
 Just hit a lick 
 For 50 more bricks 
 Balling like a bitch, with all these bricks 
 Bricks 
 36 zips 
 That's a whole chick 
 Wanna bad bitch? Gotta have bricks 
 Yeah that make sense 
 Yeah I make hits 
 But I still take bricks 
 (Verse 3-Yo Gotti) 
 Tony Montana, All I have in this world 
 Is my 100 round chopper and my white girl 
 Oil base bricks, Shit hard to cook 
 Call the plug back, Tell him he got took 
 Know what that mean? The shit free 
 That mean none for him, And more for me 
 I took somethin', I'm gutta bitch 
 Don't trust me dog, This that North Memphis shit 
 Old school, New Porsche 
 Couple choppas just in case they wanna go to war bricks 
 A.k.a my best friend 
 28 inch rims call em' grown men 
 Dope stepped on, Call it step child 
 I got that Slim Shady, We call it 8 Mile 
 I'm from North Memphis, Watkins and Brown 
 Gotti Street, And nigga that's my brick house 
 [Chorus-Gucci Mane} 
 Bricks 
 All white bricks 
 Off white bricks 
 Light tan bricks 
 Just hit a lick 
 For 50 more bricks 
 Balling like a bitch, with all these bricks 
 Bricks 
 36 zips 
 That's a whole chick 
 Wanna bad bitch? Gotta have bricks 
 Yeah that make sense 
 Yeah I make hits 
 But I still take bricks
