Don't worry 'bout how I get my money, bitch, just know I get my money 
 Don't worry 'bout I spend my money, boy, I got a lot 
 Don't worry 'bout that car I drive, don't worry 'bout that bike I ride 
 Don't worry 'bout them diamonds in that bezel on my watch 
 Don't worry 'bout it, don't worry 'bout it 
 Don't worry 'bout a mothafuckin' thing 
 Don't worry 'bout it, don't worry 'bout it 
 We got a strap up in here if niggas playing 
 When time pass and I'm not around, niggas saying I'm out of town 
 Probably moving them bricks around, they swear they know how I get down 
 Don't worry 'bout what I'm doing, don't worry 'bout what I'm doing 
 My closet full of that fly shit, black card when I buy shit 
 Sell the shit you get high with, these niggas on my dick 
 Don't worry 'bout what I'm doing, don't worry 'bout what I'm doing 
 That's your bitch, I understand, I've seen it all on Instagram 
 I'm just from the past, I done been all in that ass 
 Don't worry 'bout what I'm doing, don't worry 'bout what I'm doing 
 Don't worry 'bout how I get my money, bitch, just know I get my money 
 Don't worry 'bout I spend my money, boy, I got a lot 
 Don't worry 'bout that car I drive, don't worry 'bout that bike I ride 
 Don't worry 'bout them diamonds in that bezel on my watch 
 Don't worry 'bout it, don't worry 'bout it 
 Don't worry 'bout a mothafuckin' thing 
 Don't worry 'bout it, don't worry 'bout it 
 We got a strap up in here if niggas playing 
 Don't be worry 'bout my record deals 'cause I still got my plug 
 Don't be worry 'bout my bitch strippin', she get money out that club 
 Don't be worry 'bout my partners and 'em, we get money, we eating 
 You talk shit 'bout a real nigga, bitch, you must be tweaking 
 Don't be worried 'bout my whereabouts, money all I care about 
 Keeping it real in my neighborhood, play with me and I'mma air it out 
 Why you worry 'bout my money, nigga? Bitch, you think I'm broke? 
 The Fed worry 'bout what I'm doing, think I'm selling dope 
 I may be and I may not, go to jail I may rot 
 I ain't never gon' snitch, nigga, never been no bitch nigga 
 I got big guns, need a extra large, y'all niggas got question marks 
 Talking down on a real nigga, that's how you get a hater charged 
 Don't worry 'bout how I get my money, bitch, just know I get my money 
 Don't worry 'bout I spend my money, boy, I got a lot 
 Don't worry 'bout that car I drive, don't worry 'bout that bike I ride 
 Don't worry 'bout them diamonds in that bezel on my watch 
 Don't worry 'bout it, don't worry 'bout it 
 Don't worry 'bout a mothafuckin' thing 
 Don't worry 'bout it, don't worry 'bout it 
 We got a strap up in here if niggas playing 
 Don't worry 'bout what they talking 'bout 
 Don't tell me what that bitch done said 
 I'm done with her, you can go with her 
 I'm leaving here with another bitch 
 Don't worry 'bout how they look at me 
 My diamonds on, damn, look at me 
 These pussy nigga be shooked at me 
 Wanna judge and throw the book at me 
 Don't worry 'bout it, I ain't worried 'bout it 
 Had time to talk to my legal team 
 Don't worry 'bout it, I ain't worried 'bout it 
 Ain't shit they could do to me 
 Still rocking, still rolling 
 We holding, bill folding, you know it 
 When I start to ball out money start to fall out 
 Throw it up, it fall out the sky 
 Baddest bitches go all out, whole bar get bought out 
 That's what I call my lifestyle 
 Don't worry 'bout how I get my money, bitch, just know I get my money 
 Don't worry 'bout I spend my money, boy, I got a lot 
 Don't worry 'bout that car I drive, don't worry 'bout that bike I ride 
 Don't worry 'bout them diamonds in that bezel on my watch 
 Don't worry 'bout it, don't worry 'bout it 
 Don't worry 'bout a mothafuckin' thing 
 Don't worry 'bout it, don't worry 'bout it
