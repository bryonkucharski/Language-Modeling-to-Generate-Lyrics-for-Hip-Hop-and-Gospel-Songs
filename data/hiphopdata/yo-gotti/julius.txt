You got them birds I want a few, first I'm a drop a deuce 
 Homeboy want twelve, I want thirty, boy that's forty-two 
 Call that pick, that James Worthin, zone six, (Julius Erving) 
 Set my dunk on (Julius Erving) ride through the six like George Gervin 
 See the feet, on the fleet, white cleats on an athlete, 
 Tell 'em paper attack me, damn that thing look nasty 
 Damn this thing a classic, everybody starin' 
 Pull up in a chevy, put your cutlass in a casket 
 Simple dunk can't catch me, I'm dammit twisted backwards 
 Candy painted sixes, like them rims just did a backflip 
 My rims just did a backflip, 
 Dem lips on my rims so big they fucked round and did a front flip 
 The way I got my dunk flipped, way I got the motor flipped 
 Punch it then the front lift, whamming at the light belt 
 Slammin' at the light self, pull up in a white dunk 
 White guts, white rims 
 73 chevy, but it look like a dump truck 
 Trunk like a concert, that mean that bitch loud as fuck 
 Everything kitted up, that boy digital 
 Hundred thousand dollars in the chevy, that was pitiful 
 Hardwood floors in that bitch look like my grandma's house 
 White on white leather my seats remind me of my grandma's couch 
 Trunk having a heart attack, when I'm doin' a summersault 
 Michael Jackson twenty-six inches, they doin' the moonwalk 
 Sunday I ain't bumpin no rap, I'm bumpin Al Green 
 Monday I ain't sellin no white, I'm sellin all green 
 Yo Gotti I'm the king, no soon as I hit the scene 
 I'm watchin (colors), and then I watch my plasma screen
