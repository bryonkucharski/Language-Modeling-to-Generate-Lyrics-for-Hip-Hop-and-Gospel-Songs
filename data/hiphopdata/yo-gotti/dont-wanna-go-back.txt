Listen to this track 
 Drumma Boy, Drumma Boy 
 Yeah 
 Yuh 
 I am 
 I don't wanna go back 
 Sellin' no crack no more 
 I don't wanna go back (I don't wanna go) 
 Shootin' them Macs no more (brrt) 
 I don't wanna go back (I don't want to) 
 But a nigga gon' make me 
 If I don't go back 
 I know the hood gon' hate me, yeah 
 I don't wanna go back (I don't wanna go back) 
 Sellin' no crack no more (Sellin' no crack no more) 
 I don't wanna go back (I don't wanna go) 
 Shootin' them Macs no more (Shootin' no Macs no more) 
 I don't wanna go back (I don't have to) 
 But a nigga gon' make me (nigga gon' make me) 
 If I don't go back 
 I know the hood gon' hate me, yeah 
 Came a long way 
 Started from the bottom 
 Ridgecrest apartments, M&M's I got 'em 
 Name duckin' no problem 
 Niggas know it so they tryin' to put the bait on me 
 How we from the same hood 
 Watch me make it out, but then you pour hate on me 
 Shame on you 
 I was finna put the chain on you 
 Now I gotta put the aim on you 
 How your enemies the same, homie 
 Damn homie 
 Big homie shit (get the bricks and bust 'em down with you) 
 War shit a thousand rounds with you 
 I was wrappin' bricks and sending pounds with you 
 Now I'm on TV 
 Diamonds drippin', [?] 
 Deep inside you wanna be me 
 Federal 3 that shit on repeat 
 Reach for my chain, [?] (aye) 
 Feelin' like Yeezy so I need a cape 
 Talkin' bout Kim or talking to [?] 
 Black [?] on the side of the Wraith 
 When it come to the bag they know I don't play 
 I don't wanna go back 
 Sellin' no crack no more 
 I don't wanna go back (I don't wanna go) 
 Shootin' them Macs no more (brrt) 
 I don't wanna go back 
 But a nigga gon' make me 
 If I don't go back 
 I know the hood gon' hate me, yeah 
 I don't wanna go back (I don't wanna go back, I don't wanna go back, I don't wanna go back) 
 I don't wanna go back (I don't wanna go back) 
 Shootin' them Macs no more 
 I don't wanna go back (I don't have to) 
 But a nigga gon' make me (nigga gon' make me) 
 If I don't go back 
 I know the hood gon' hate me, yeah (gon' make 'em hate me) 
 Ain't gon' lie 
 Sometimes I wish I could retire 
 Wish I didn't have to tote the fire 
 I wish my name wasn't always in the news 
 I can't go no where without the tools 
 If you go against me you gon' lose (lose) 
 Me and all the deals close every day 
 I barely made it outta school 
 Fuck credit, cash rules 
 Be like tell youngsta calm down 
 Put the guns down but I kinda feel 'em 
 You will never understand 
 You ain't from the hood, niggas tryin' to kill 'em 
 I tryin' to put my youngin' on the chart 
 They trying to trick my youngin' out of spite 
 You tryin' to cop a Benz off the lot 
 I'm tryin' to pull up in my own yacht 
 I got different dreams, different goals 
 We in different brackets, we got different hoes too 
 I don't [?] supposed to 
 Spread rumors, that's what hoes do 
 I was sick and tired, sick and tired of sellin' crack 
 If I have it my way I'm never goin' back 
 I hate a disloyal nigga and a rat 
 Fell in love with fast money and the strap 
 I don't wanna go back 
 Sellin' no crack no more 
 I don't wanna go back (I don't wanna go) 
 Shootin' them Macs no more (brrt) 
 I don't wanna go back (I don't want to) 
 But a nigga gon' make me 
 If I don't go back 
 I know the hood gon' hate me, yeah 
 I don't wanna go back (I don't wanna go back) 
 Sellin' no crack no more (Sellin' no crack no more) 
 I don't wanna go back (I don't wanna go) 
 Shootin' them Macs no more (Shootin' no Macs no more) 
 I don't wanna go back (I don't have to) 
 But a nigga gon' make me (nigga gon' make me) 
 If I don't go back 
 I know the hood gon' hate me, yeah 
 Yeah 
 I'ma make 'em hate me 
 Fuck it 
 They already hate me 
 Fuck it 
 I'ma make 'em hate me
