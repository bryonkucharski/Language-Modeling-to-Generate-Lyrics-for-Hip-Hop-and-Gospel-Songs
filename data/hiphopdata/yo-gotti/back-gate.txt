You want an ounce? 
 Nigga, meet me at the back gate 
 Pull up, cut ya car off 
 Never sipped lean in the first place 
 'Cause I ain't never wanna nod off 
 I was cooking cocaine getting hard off 
 A .25 and a sawed-off 
 8 dimes for the 80 
 Hope and foreign, the baby 
 Put a pound, hot nigga 
 Head to start off 
 (Back gate!) 
 Pumping like a motherfucker (back gate!) 
 Jumping like a motherfucker (back gate!) 
 Get money like a motherfucker (back gate!) 
 We robbin' like a motherfucker (back gate!) 
 Pull up at your own risk (back gate!) 
 Knowing we were with the shit (back gate!) 
 Tryna down a lot of bricks (back gate!) 
 Lot of niggas got hit (back gate!) 
 Ay, I'm talkin' 'bout 
 That back gate made a nigga 
 I seen that same back gate break niggas 
 You wanna fish a nigga, I advise you stay on top 
 Lost nigga in through the back gate (back gate!) 
 Trap came fucked up the crime rate (back gate!) 
 Old head fucked up my mind state 
 Watch him killing me cold blood in the broad day 
 If I ain't know God I would've lost faith 
 Niggas couldn't eat while they lost weight 
 Niggas ain't going on no diet 
 Niggas kill a nigga by they pride 
 Niggas gon' slide 
 Niggas gon' do 25 in a cell for' a nigga switch sides 
 You can see it in my eyes 
 That's pain, lost niggas to the game, and ain't the same 
 Did it for the check, I ain't do it for the fame 
 Only time you shot a pistol is at the motherfucking range 
 You a pussy if you gotta close your eyes for' you aim 
 (Back gate!) 
 Pumping like a motherfucker (back gate!) 
 Jumping like a motherfucker (back gate!) 
 Get money like a motherfucker (back gate!) 
 We robbin' like a motherfucker (back gate!) 
 Pull up at your own risk (back gate!) 
 Knowing we were with the shit (back gate!) 
 Tryna down a lot of bricks (back gate!) 
 Lot of niggas got hit (back gate!) 
 Told the plug meet me at the bottom (back gate!) 
 Showed me two bricks and I shot him (back gate!) 
 First time I ever did a robbery (back gate!) 
 Ever since then they been hard for me 
 I'ma cut throat nigga's arteries (back gate!) 
 I shouldn't be trusted properly 
 Reach Chris turned me to a savage 
 Used to couldn't flip on a pissy ass mattress (back gate!) 
 I know a lot of killers is activing 
 Know a lot of rappers that's active 
 Used to get my work from the plug I was paying on the backhand 
 That was back then when I was trapping 
 First time I ever shot a pistol I was 13 
 Glock hold 17, black with the red beam 
 First time I ever shot a nigga, rival hood shoot-out shit 
 Feeling like a wet dream, fell in love with the streets 
 Got a couple choppers, fell in love with the beef (back gate!) 
 Got a couple bricks and we all gon' leave (back gate!) 
 Back gate jumping like the coddle (back gate!) 
 Ain't no other hood trapping harder (back gate!) 
 Saved a hunnit thou when I was 16 
 I was moving bricks by the 16 
 That millimeter hold 16 
 Turned the back gate to a crime scene 
 (Back gate!) 
 Pumping like a motherfucker (back gate!) 
 Jumping like a motherfucker (back gate!) 
 Get money like a motherfucker (back gate!) 
 We robbin' like a motherfucker (back gate!) 
 Pull up at your own risk (back gate!) 
 Knowing we were with the shit (back gate!) 
 Tryna down a lot of bricks (back gate!) 
 Lot of niggas got hit (back gate!)
