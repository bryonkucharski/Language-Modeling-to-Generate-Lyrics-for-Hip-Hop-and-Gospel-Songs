 I got that drip (drip) 
 I'm overseas (seas) 
 D-R-I-P-P-I-N-G 
 I got that VVS I-C-E 
 Ooh, frozen like a cooler 
 Juice, blame it on my jeweler 
 I got stones on my neck (ooh) 
 Blood on my set (ooh) 
 Water on my wrist (drip) 
 Put glitter on my bitch (ju-juice) 
 My ex was a waitress 
 So I gave that hoe a tip (ooh) 
 My ex fucked a lame 
 Now she workin' double shifts (no juice) 
 Our money ain't the same 
 You a lame, and it clear (ooh) 
 I did ten mil in 11 months, not a year (juice) 
 I gave fifty racks in the club to appear (ju-juice) 
 I blew two mil on my dog for a appeal 
 I got that juice

 Hol' up, aye yo, Gotti, who as hot as you? 
 You'll avoid talkin' money, know there's too much juice 
 You may see me with security, but know I'm the one shootin' 
 I been a boss all my life, I made a millionaire or two 
 And you might see me in a coupe with the disappearing roof 
 I had packs, I got plaques, you get taxed for the juice 
 If you ask, you get facts, I'm at Saks with your boo
