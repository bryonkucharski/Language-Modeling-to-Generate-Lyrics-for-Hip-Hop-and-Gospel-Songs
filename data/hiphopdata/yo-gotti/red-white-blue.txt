United States of America, nigga 
 Land of the free 
 Nigga what you'd do for your country? 
 You know what I'd do for mine? 
 Everything but go to war, nigga 
 Yeah, I'm into it with niggas right around the corner from me 
 I ain't gotta go out the motherfucking country to shoot them choppers nigga 
 Colombians, Mexicans 
 Even got some work from the Dominicans 
 American, land of the free 
 National anthem shit 
 My country tis of thee 
 Red, white, and blue 
 Red, white, and blue 
 Crip and Blood shit 
 Nigga I salute 
 Red, white, and blue 
 Red, white, and blue 
 Cocaine shit 
 Nigga I salute 
 Colombians and Mexicans, I'm tryna re-up 
 Stop the beat let's get something understood -- I stay g'd up 
 Maybach with my feet up, AK when I creep up 
 My young niggas rep Blood Gang, my OGs rep Hoover 
 All I got is shooters, all we do is shoot up 
 Little bad bitch got no aim, she must work at Hooters 
 Remember being in New York when the towers blew up 
 Now I got a 911 Porsche with the blue guts 
 Rims'll make you throw up, something to make you blow up 
 Niggas getting little money, when you gon grow up? 
 Louis from the toe up, street nigga, so what? 
 Louis XIII and I just tell them bitches poor up 
 Work 
 Voila, haha, 18 wheeler fulla 
 Pounds of ? green and thirty bricks inside a Honda 
 He don't speak any English, all he know is numbers 
 That's my man's he plug me he gon get me through the summer 
 He don't know my name, him there just a runner 
 He pick it up and drop it off then he gets him yonder 
 Land of the free, run up if you wanna 
 Suicide mission, we got choppers in this Hummer 
 Red, white, and blue, I'm no politician 
 But I live in a white house so I feel presidential 
 I pledge allegiance to the flag, United Streets of America 
 In God we trust, in one we stand, I'll always be a hustler 
 Work 
 The block Frank Sinatra thirty thousand feet up in the air eating lobster 
 Doing what I gotsta 
 Catch me at the tables, hundred thousand a marker 
 ? 
 Fucking with the wrong set, ain't even perform yet 
 Short one to AC, Vegas we took the long jet 
 Blue chip in the field, red one on the horn bet 
 Money straight, work good, the neck ain't did me wrong yet 
 They come in powder form till we rock 'em up 
 Land of the free, but they tryna lock me up 
 Ha, I'm in the trap till the sky change 
 Drug dealer nightmares, millionaire migraines 
 Work
