You love that hood that you represent 
 You bout that working and all that money spent 
 A nigga owe you every cent 
 My niggas hustle hard just to pay the rent 
 My niggas busting just to pay the rent 
 Cause bitches nothing we need or set 
 We reunite nigga when we spend 
 My niggas hustle hard just to pay the rent 
 No's my birthplace, thug water my T-shirt 
 I'm uptown in these hot blocks where there feens walk then this feet heard 
 It's DJ on rebirth, fat boys on stakeout 
 No hard heels just chuck taylors 
 In case I might break up 
 Right now is drought season 
 Watch how it's gonna play out 
 Last night two teenagers got killed up in Jose house 
 Feel like there's no way out 
 Guess I gotta just stay down 
 Play ball and sell dope 
 Project's my playground 
 D bought a new condo 
 He ain't even sleep in his bed yet 
 Cause this girl all in his D talking 'bout bill he ain't even pay yet 
 Thought how to be cool with it 
 Real niggas ain't bad at it 
 These motherfuckers who owe me 
 Chopping off their head now 
 You love that hood that you represent 
 You bout that working and all that money spent 
 A nigga owe you every cent 
 My niggas hustle hard just to pay the rent 
 My niggas busting just to pay the rent 
 Cause bitches nothing we need or set

 I go back like dro bags 
 Nigga Michael Jordan nigga 96 
 Streets dry, I came through 
 Lebron james Game 6 
 Drive lane right behind the back 
 Two cars back on my main drive 
 They Pulling on they find the bricks 
 Ain't Worried Bout It cause my mane lie 
 On Two A pack too fly 
 Selling in the street no B by 
 Why they call it white president 
 Niggas all I see is this green god 
 Nigga I ain't going to my mama house 
 Try being my mama mouth 
 Your trap boomin you ain't rit up 
 You don't need last for half hour 
 Tap for they owe me 
 DEA they want me 
 Still serve the whole hood out the town 
 Theat the prices like my compound 
 Bag landed me the touchdown

 Nigger cask up before they touched down 
 You love that hood that you represent 
 You bout that working and all that money spent 
 A nigga owe you every cent 
 My niggas hustle hard just to pay the rent 
 My niggas busting just to pay the rent 
 Cause bitches nothing we need or set

 It's summer town my airport, my house light 400 degrees 
 Money long my bills high so still flippin money in these streets 
 Juvenile, I've been wild, big pistols, coke piles 
 Old Chevy, big wheels 
 Tight motor, gun loud 
 Don't know hard 
 You a bitch nigga 
 Ten bricks you a rich nigga 
 Part time I rap nigga 
 Now out of town I hits niggas 
 Can't shake my problems 
 Low key I'll be robbin' 
 Weapon of choice that .38 
 'Cause I fell in love in revolvers 
 I ain't leaving no shells 
 I ain't going no jail 
 I ain't leaving no witness nigga 
 Everybody go to hell 
 Everybody had a struggle 
 Everybody had a hustle 
 This everybody who you're fucking with 
 Nigga why the fuck you coughing?

 Made a living out birds

 Used to dream 'bout a million 
 But I woke up and count it though 
 You love that hood that you represent 
 You bout that working and all that money spent 
 A nigga owe you every cent
