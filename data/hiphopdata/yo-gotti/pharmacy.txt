 Um da neighborhood pharmacy 
 I was livin' my life like a muthafuckin rockstar 
 Sellin dem white blocks put me in a cop car 
 Put me in front a judge told your honor I ain't guilty 
 Talkn bout some bullshit came outta conspiracy 
 I'm young 'n' um thuggin' goin' hard 'n' um hustlin 
 Um jus tryna get my money mane um sick and tired of strugglin 
 My people doin' time my family countin' on me 
 Lord don't take my freedom way got a lot a ridin' on me 
 Um gamblin wit my life um jus tryna throw a 11 
 Um jus tryna jump a point foe I see another 7 
 If all else fails and shit ain't what it seems
