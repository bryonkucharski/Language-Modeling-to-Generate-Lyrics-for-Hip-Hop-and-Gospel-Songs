 With an empty drum, where I'm from that'll get you hung 
 Murder rate, murder rate 
 Was ducking the DA, now I'm at the VMAs (look at me) 
 Killin' shit, yellow tape (yellow tape) 
 They don't wanna see a nigga elevate (anyway)

 All these lil fuck niggas irritate 
 Shoot one these niggas, don't hesitate
