Picture me performing in an orpheum 
 A poor, living in the orphanage, damn 
 What my future hold? Only god knows 
 That's why I'm staying prayed up, and ten towns 
 Down on these clowns mean-fug forwns turn 'em up side down 
 Let smoke out the pound of the kush 
 Presidential like bush, whoops I mean to Barrack 
 It's a coupe but it don't drop 
 Hard top killa 
 For I let another nigga disrespect my niggas, my hood, my family, I kill 'em 
 Fuck em, I don't feel em, when the beat drops nigga, gets realer 
 Any niggas can get it, any niggas can die 
 Any nigga can front like they real, any nigga can lie 
 Any nigga can make some money, only ganstas' survive 
 And everybody can be gansta but any nigga can try, killa 
 Fourth peela, west side, white ville, MCI, 201

 Stop the beat, pose, take a break 
 Breathe in the smells, then drop the bass 
 World Fair, section 8, lord help my people
