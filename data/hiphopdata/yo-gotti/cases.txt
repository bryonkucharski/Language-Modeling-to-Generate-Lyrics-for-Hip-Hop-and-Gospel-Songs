We cop Rozay by the cases, Forces by the cases 
 Three hundred dollar True Religion, we cop 'em by the cases 
 Lawyer fight my cases, Gucci's got no laces 
 Bakin' Soda by the cases, in the kitchen doin' the matrix 
 Go up, down, up, down, my top doing the matrix 
 I'll need a model, we don't ride shit basic 
 Everything kitty, cocaine crazy 
 Bitch they hit my phone, they fucked up my situation 
 DJ droppin' Gotti, dope boy's all went cray 
 Shoot a thousand, bet a thousand, gambling with your savings 
 Kitchen doing numbers, I may need a helper 
 Bitch said she wasn't fucking, so you know a nigga left her 
 Rozay by the cases, rubbers by the boxes 
 They all that I'm the shit, so how the fuck she gon' be cocky? 
 Yeah these hoes be foxy, yeah, my eyes be rockin' 
 I pulled up in that white cutlass, 4:15 that bass was droppin' 
 We cop Rozay by the cases, Forces by the cases 
 Three hundred dollar True Religion, we cop 'em by the cases 
 Lawyer fight my cases, Gucci's got no laces 
 Bakin' Soda by the cases, in the kitchen doin' the matrix 
 I am gearin' to the money, all upper cases 
 Trap on fire, I stay down the street from Satan 
 Hell on Earth, I say hello to my neighbor 
 Ghetto nigger got a mansion, and I'm still stealing cable 
 Still air force ridin', I should get sky mileage 
 Try me in the club, we gon' whoop your ass inside it 
 All my hoes excited, damn yo weed is quiet 
 Plug getting mad, 'cause he think I'm gon' retire 
 Just had a case, lawyer ask for a dismissal 
 Real d-boy, I gotta settle for some Christmas 
 Me and Yo Gotti, from Atlanta down to Memphis 
 Getting money I could pay you nigga, fool, pay attention 
 Favorite rapper dead, so the gamin' got borin' 
 Pulled up in some foreign, drop the top and hit the horn 
 Snatched out doin' a hundred, they like Gotti where ya goin'? 
 I got a bitch from THU, I'm 'bout to scoop her from the dorm 
 Yeah, we doin' the matrix, call her children of the corn 
 Fuckin', somethin' ain't right, 'n she gon' swallow my unborn 
 Friends say she whorrin', talkin' bout she goin' 
 Say she want that Luis bag, I asked her which one 
 It's not a big issue nigga, know my ho can get it 
 I could get your bottle, truckload fill up my whole kitchen 
 Why these niggas bitchin, when they come down to they bitches 
 All these excuses, all this trickin, man I guess they just ain't get me
