I had the green in my auntie house, like Jeezy 
 Guns in my grandma, fo' sheezy 
 Baby mama holding that work, and that's real 
 A nigga took something from Gotti and got killed 
 Shady pistol drive, we posted up on the hill 
 And the grams and the halves for fifty, how I feel 
 I got it, been had it since '95 
 '73 Monte green, twenty inch tires 
 (Southern Smoke!) 
 Pop where that chicken 
 Right back on the street, with they snitching ass 
 Say my name, you won't get 
 Got the beam on the top, let's hit it 
 I went to school with a phone and a pager 
 Because a nigga major was selling niggas major 
 Prices got outrageous, niggas started robbing 
 Gotti got a chopper, chop a nigga block 
 Boom, boom, like a fucking helicopter 
 Sandwich bag, razor, quarter thing in a locker 
 You was working 9 to 5's, I was slinging blocks up 
 I was sipping Cristal, you were drinking vodka 
 I'ma keep a pistol, all my niggas locked 
 Gudda doing ten, but they still can't stop us 
 I'ma hold the block up, got it on my shoulder 
 '67 drop, worth the price of a Rover 
 Macked out, blacked out, old school Nova 
 Lights out, hang out, fuck a nigga Hova 
 Bitch get your mind right, thought a nigga told you 
 Yo Gotti from the north, I'm a dirty south soldier 
 Full time grinder, dirty south boss 
 Spent sixty five thou' on a white and yellow cross 
 Another forty five for a white and yellow chain 
 Another thirty five just to let you know my name 
 I'm back to the basics, I'm back to the block 
 I never left the dope alone, I never left the Glocks 
 I never closed shop, I never left the city 
 To you hate motherfuckers, if you want me come get me 
 I'm still in the same hood, still do the same shit 
 Still got the same homies, still fuck the same bitch 
 Got a plan to get money? I'm with it 
 What's up Jeezy? Let's get it
