Yeah, this might be the realest shit I ever wrote 
 It's crazy that, nigga all the motherfucking heart I got, everything I've been through in the streets 
 I learned from a woman 
 That's right nigga, I know women realer than niggas 
 I got the game from my momma, aunties, shout out to Janet 
 Momma, I don't never want to see you struggle 
 Tired of seeing me bump heads with my big brother 
 Momma, that's big bruh, you ain't got to worry 
 We'll die together, kill together, face a fuckin' jury 
 Momma, I'm like a father to my little sister 
 Gotta make sure she do right, she my baby sister 
 Momma, I'm just living how you taught a nigga 
 Said I ain't raising no pussies, I got one daughter, nigga 
 I remember them Feds came and got a nigga 
 Asked me where you at and I wouldn't talk to niggas 
 Momma, living room floor with tears in my eyes hearing them say you gon be gone for a long time, Momma 
 See I'm following your blueprint, you know what I mean 
 See I grew up in the street with vultures 
 I learned, what I learned in the house nigga 
 How ill is that and that's all facts nigga 
 Nigga I know women who did 10/15 years 'cause they stood on what they believe 
 Shout out my Auntie Janet she a motherfucker 
 PeeWee did 10 back out and she still hustling 
 Erica used to write you letters tell you that she love you 
 Then we used to drive to visit you up in Kentucky 
 Like we went from being rich that shit was super ugly 
 Then my Momma got a job, now she selling groceries 
 Used to have a house in Vegas when we was doing good 
 And a house behind Elvis now we in the hood 
 Used to have a Benz now we got a Nissan Sentra 
 And I can't get a pair of Jordans that's fucking with my mental 
 I'm just tryna let you visualize what I done been through 
 And this shit public record nigga you check my credentials 
 Facts 
 See nigga, all this shit come from the heart 
 This pain, this struggle 
 This is motherfucking time away from my loved ones 
 When you hear me rapping this shit nigga, this shit like cancer, I'm just letting it out, only way I know how 
 I switched the family hustle put us back on top 
 Momma live on 5 acres brother in that drop 
 Sister she an entrepreneur get her own M's 
 Feds still watch the family but we don't even see em 
 I ain't tripping nigga this the art of hustle holmes 
 I went from flipping dope to buying houses flipping homes 
 Momma taught me fuck your losses just keep moving on 
 If you get caught just never snitch one day you coming home 
 Momma, gave me the game and for Mother's Day 
 I spent a million and a half for you on Privé 
 And you the owner I'm a worker 
 This shit yours do what you want to you deserve it 
 Momma 
 See this is a unique story 
 I was raised by at least 6 women and one male 
 And that wasn't even my father nigga, real shit 
 I ain't got beef with my pops, no shit like that 
 Truth be told, nigga our bond come from the game 
 Nigga I was fronting my daddy bricks 
 Nigga what kind of shit is that 
 I grew up around hustlers that turned me to a hustler 
 Was raised by a woman I watched my Momma hustle 
 I just want to be a kingpin 
 Teacher asked me what's my Momma she a queenpin 
 And this my family tradition 
 I'm just keeping on my family tradition 
 We built a legacy 
 And when I grow up I want to be a kingpin 
 Teacher asked me what's my Momma she a queenpin
