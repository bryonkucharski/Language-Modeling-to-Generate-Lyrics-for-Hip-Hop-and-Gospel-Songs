(Intro: Yo Gotti) 
 I'm going going back back to the Bay 
 Rest in peace Mac Dre 
 All I do is talk yay 
 (Bridge: Yo Gotti) 
 In the club got them bottles on replay 
 Tryna break a record like a DJ 
 That's a hundred fifty bottles in one night 
 I give that bitch some act right 
 Act right, act right 
 Money don't fold if it act right 
 Act right, act right 
 Niggas playin' games you can act right 
 (Verse 1: Yo Gotti) 
 I'm goin' goin' back back to the Bay 
 Rest in peace Mac Dre 
 I'm a street nigga all I do is talk yay 
 Want me in your city nigga know they gon' pay 
 Ain't lookin' for a free throw, lookin' for a freak ho 
 Cuban link chain on my neck weigh a kilo 
 Nigga just violated pissed dirty to his P.O 
 On the real nigga scale one to ten you a zero 
 Damn, that a bad bitch you a Creole 
 On the West coast but she say she from the N.O 
 Act right, get your life changed 
 Fuck a pair of shoes, you can get the last name 
 Real nigga shit boy I hate lames 
 All my nigga sell dope or gang bang 
 Me and cash get the act right 
 You ain't in a foreign you don't look right 
 (Hook: Yo Gotti) 
 Act right, act right 
 Money don't fold if it act right 
 Act right, act right 
 Niggas playin' games you can act right 
 (Verse 2: Young Jeezy) 
 I'mma tell ya off top mother fuck free Boosie 
 Ridin' in my Lamborghini with the dope man uzi 
 Thinkin' came with a step might be the shit 
 I got a rooster in my Rari might be your bitch 
 I said I pull up in this bitch in that Aventador 
 Make you bitch pass out straight hit the floor 
 Said I never seen a car like that before 
 What's that thang stickin up said that's the door 
 I told YG I'mma go ride the whip 
 You just hangin' out the window ghost ride the clip 
 I made my first quarter million dollars off the blow 
 He want a nine piece chicken took that to-go 
 I'mma tell ya like this, y'all motherfucker listen 
 Kilo all day motherfucker I'm trippin' 
 But if you run up on me thinking I'm slippin' 
 Michael Jordan with the chopper bet I hit you like Pippen act right 
 (Hook: Yo Gotti) 
 Act right, act right 
 Money don't fold if it act right 
 Act right, act right 
 Niggas playin' games you can act right 
 (Verse 3: YG) 
 Goin' goin' back back to the bank 
 Rest in peace to my safe 
 I'mma fly nigga nigga I take your ho 
 I'll have to leave her if she did me like Coco 
 The devil talkin' to me, but I don't hear him 
 Act like I'm deaf like So-So 
 Fuck you, fuck him, fuck them 
 Fuck my ex and her cohorts 
 Hundred bottles in the club, for no reason 
 Niggas start trippin' boom bow dope fiend 
 Fendi on my shoes, Fendi on my belt 
 I'm in the Fendi store I don't need help 
 All gold everything like Trinidad 
 I went to high school with you bitch you been a rat 
 I don't got money problems, I got trust issues 
 Two things I gotta stay is with the two pistols 
 (Hook: Yo Gotti) 
 Act right, act right 
 Money don't fold if it act right 
 Act right, act right 
 Niggas playin' games you can act right
