All right lets be clear 
 They might have done a thing or two 
 But there track record in the streets is "Ain't Like Me" 
 They ain't me 
 Ain't me, ain't me, these pussy ass niggas ain't me 
 Got a couple main hoes that I'm fucking round with 
 But this one bad bitch you can't see 
 And all my niggas get straight to the money, these stones all clear HD 
 And my DC chain shine bright, shine bright with my gold AP 
 Ain't me, ain't me, these pussy ass niggas ain't me 
 Got a couple real niggas that I'm fucking round with 
 Can't come round a nigga ain't see 
 And them bricks still sell them for the high 
 My nigga in the drop top birds ain't cheap 
 These niggas still sell the work 
 Tell 'em work ain't that easy 
 Ain't me, ain't me, these pussy ass niggas ain't me 
 These pussy ass niggas can't come to my hood 
 'Cause you pussy ass niggas ain't me 
 I got all these shooters that's down for the cause 
 And they all get money like me 
 And, and I still ride around my hood 
 Quarter milli on a nigga white tee 
 And y'all niggas still hating on it, still hating on it 
 Talking what they gonna do to me 
 But I'm strapped up & I'm waiting on it 
 These niggas ain't built like that 
 These niggas get killed like that 
 Running 'round my name in their mouth 
 Banana clips get peeled like that 
 And they wonder why I feel like that 
 'Cause every other month I make a mill like that 
 Took my whole family up out that hood 
 Set 'em all nice in the hills like that, shit real like that 
 You ain't gotta like my shit, pay for the flow, I don't write my shit 
 Better pray to God I don't like your bitch 
 'Cause if she catch eye then she might get hit! Whoa! 
 Ain't me, ain't me, these pussy ass niggas ain't me 
 Got a couple main hoes that I'm fucking round with 
 But this one bad bitch you can't see 
 And all my niggas get straight to the money, these stones all clear HD 
 And my DC chain shine bright, shine bright with my gold AP 
 Ain't me, ain't me, these pussy ass niggas ain't me 
 Got a couple real niggas that I'm fucking round with 
 Can't come round a nigga ain't see 
 And them bricks still sell them for the high 
 My nigga in the drop top birds ain't cheap 
 These niggas still sell the work 
 Tell 'em work ain't that easy 
 I'm a real ass nigga and I've been like that 
 Day one and I ain't gone change 
 In the hood nigga act a little different when I come through 
 'Cause a nigga got a little change 
 Little pussy ass nigga don't test no nigga 
 'Cause if he do then its gone be flames 
 That 40 gone go bang bang 
 Them niggas might say my name 
 My young niggas got rollies on 
 Bitches got them Birkins on 
 My trigger finger been itchin' 
 My patients short, but my money long 
 Its levels to this shit for real 
 Boy I'm dream chasing tryna see a hundred M's 
 Got the plug on deck if I wanna go back 
 Put work in the trap what you know about that 
 Pillow talking to ya ho hating on a nigga 
 Fuck around lose ya ho like that 
 Ain't me, ain't me, these rapping ass niggas, ain't me 
 Only fuck with real niggas like Meek (What up meek?) 
 You ain't CMG or DC 
 Ain't me, ain't me, these pussy ass niggas ain't me 
 Got a couple main hoes that I'm fucking round with 
 But this one bad bitch you can't see 
 And all my niggas get straight to the money, these stones all clear HD 
 And my DC chain shine bright, shine bright with my gold AP 
 Ain't me, ain't me, these pussy ass niggas ain't me 
 Got a couple real niggas that I'm fucking round with 
 Can't come round a nigga ain't see 
 And them bricks still sell them for the high 
 My nigga in the drop top birds ain't cheap 
 These niggas still sell the work 
 Tell 'em work ain't that easy 
 Ain't me, these pussy ass niggas ain't me 
 Gettin' money my day ones you know we reppin' DC 
 Cousin dropped that bag on you, I kill you niggas for free 
 I got all this money on me, I got all these hundreds on me ho 
 Backin' up in this Panamera with some rich ass hoes 
 Started off with a quarter ounce, had to get that dough 
 Flip them, move circles on them like Tic Tac Toe 
 Hoes ready they fucking sucking on the get set go 
 Ain't me, ain't me, these pussy ass niggas ain't me 
 Got a couple main hoes that I'm fucking round with 
 But this one bad bitch you can't see 
 And all my niggas get straight to the money, these stones all clear HD 
 And my DC chain shine bright, shine bright with my gold AP 
 Ain't me, ain't me, these pussy ass niggas ain't me 
 Got a couple real niggas that I'm fucking round with 
 Can't come round a nigga ain't see 
 And them bricks still sell them for the high 
 My nigga in the drop top birds ain't cheap 
 These niggas still sell the work 
 Tell 'em work ain't that easy 
 I guess we can't tell you enough 
 What you do won't make you me 
 Truthfully some of you niggas need to get some sleep 
 Your dreams aren't manifesting correctly
