They tried play me 
 My own squad tried betray me 
 Never love these bitches 'cause they played me 
 Can't leave these streets because they paid me 
 I can't believe they tried betray me 
 I can't believe they tried betray me 
 I can't believe they tried betray me 
 I won't let these niggas faze me 
 I just got a phone call, it got me rethinking shit 
 Homeboys and my enemies been on some linking shit 
 An OG big homie, sucker shit can't condone it 
 Catch a body, I'm on it 
 It's CMG, now who want it? 
 I can't believe you tried betray me 
 Oh that's the way you gon' repay me 
 Got to stay two steps ahead, too many cats in the fed 
 Think I broke too much this bread, too many suckers got fed, for real 
 I can't believe they tried betray me 
 I can't believe they tried betray me 
 I can't believe they tried betray me 
 I won't let these niggas faze me 
 Death before dishonor how they raised me 
 Seen the double cross, that shit didn't faze me 
 Had the FN with me, upped it on 'em daily 
 Baow baow baow baow baow, crazy 
 Double cross, double cross 
 They killed my lil partner, it's another loss 
 It's murder on my mind, I got bloody thoughts 
 I hope none of these niggas come piss me off 
 I heard my lil bitch been out fuckin' on 'em 
 Yeah that's my lil bitch but I cut her off 
 The hitters gon' fire when I say 
 Off with her head, I really mean take it off, literally 
 Ay, they tried betray me 
 I can't believe this ho just played me 
 You made a me, you-you made me a savage 
 (I'ma make you regret it) 
 Ay, you made me a savage (savage) 
 You had my heart on automatic (automatic, brr) 
 I used to think you were the baddest 
 Damn I think your ass just average 
 Ay, you shouldn't betray me 
 Now I'm fuckin' on your friends on the daily 
 I'm betrayin' you 
 Nah, I'm repayin' you 
 I grew up with these niggas from the motherfuckin' mud 
 Despite whatever I have and always showed these niggas love 
 We all was coppin' bricks and with the shit, we all was thugs 
 We always had them dreams of bein' the man and meetin' the plug 
 This rap shit jumped off for me, I thought niggas would support me 
 Instead, they tried to bring a nigga down, federal court me 
 You my man, you can't take no stand, you can't make no statement 
 We been rockin' since the sixth grade, how you gon' betray me? 
 Damn, my own partner tried betray me 
 Thought you would be the one to save me 
 You played yourself when you played me 
 I got the key, yeah that's how they raised me 
 Had to learn the hard way that these bitches just gon' be bitches 
 Just fuck 'em, keep it movin' my nigga, get out your feelings 
 Yeah, shout out to Sonja, shout out to Sandra 
 She was married, I still put dick all down her tonsil 
 These hoes be hateful and these hoes be petty 
 These hoes ain't boujee but they always ready 
 Then act like they regret it 
 I guess you sorry for the head the other day 
 All that complaining but all you do is betray 
 If I was your nigga, bitch you have to find somewhere to stay 
 Bitch you gon' have to get the fuck out my house right here today 
 'Cause you betrayed me 
 I can't believe this ho just played me 
 But in a way this ho just saved me 
 'Cause you played yourself when you played me 
 I'll never cross on my niggas 
 And I, I'll never cross on my niggas 
 Played yourself, you played yourself, you played yourself ho 
 Yo played yourself, you played yourself, you played yourself ho 
 I am, still 
 And when the help come here, homie don't you confuse it 
 Lames gon' copy, D boys gon' abuse it
