(Rich Homie Quan) 
 I know, I know, I know 
 I know, I know, I know (What you know Quan?) 
 You ain't that nigga you say you is (Well how you know though?) 
 Just know that I know, I know, I know (Okay!) 
 Them streets, they fuck with me strong 
 And them bitches gon fuck just because money long 
 You know that I know, I know, I know 
 Well you know that I know it, I know it, I know 
 (Yo Gotti) 
 You a fuck nigga and it ain't a secret 
 I'm so official they can referee it (they know I am) 
 Black gun, white work, I got jungle fever 
 28 on the scale, all I drop is ether (Rich Homie) 
 Get money, break bread, gotta feed your people 
 Every day like thanksgiving, everybody eating 
 I put work in the hood, let my homies grind 
 I do what I do to see my niggas shine 
 I know what I know and man that's all I know 
 I take 63 grams and try to make a four 
 That's a couple ounces if I get it right 
 Wanna see my homies rich 'cause nigga this the life 
 I know

 Hey, I know that you ain't that nigga you claim to be 
 Despite how much money that I make this shit ain't changing me 
 I know, I know, I know, a lot of these niggas, they lame to me 
 I'm blown, I smoke what I rolled is with the same nigga that I came in with 
 (Rich Homie baby) I'm on the west coast in a low rider 
 Four bitches tryna leave with me 
 Ain't enough room and I don't know y'all 
 I'm high as fuck, you a low pilot 
 I got a pharmacy ho for them narcotics 
 Put a potato on it, make it shoot silent 
 Fuck wrong with you? You profiling 
 I done made a million dollars and I didn't go to college (Fuck you mean) 
 And all my niggas get locked for some work 
 Best believe he goin' silent 
 He don't know nobody, can't trust nobody but yo self 
 So believe me when I tell you that I know about it 
 When I asked yo ho about it she said me and Yo Gotti 
 The realest niggas left and I told that bitch 
 (Rich Homie Quan) 
 I know, I know, I know

 Just know that I know, I know, I know (Okay!) 
 Them streets, they fuck with me strong 
 And them bitches gon fuck just because money long 
 You know that I know, I know, I know 
 Well you know that I know it, I know it, I know 
 (Yo Gotti) 
 I wanna see my homies rich forever 
 I know some secrets, I'll never tell em 
 I got some birds but I'd never mail em 
 You in love with Instagram hoes and you ain't never met em 
 Pocket full of money, boy I know the feeling 
 I know that niggas hatin' that's why I lost the civic 
 And the drophead, of the 71 cutlass on 8's 
 And my wife beater on, with my hat to the back 
 Started from the bottom like Drake 
 But I'm with the same old niggas that I started with 
 Same young niggas I was robbing with 
 And if these niggas have a problem with 
 Got them automatic pistols no revolver shit (Bang!) 
 And I know niggas sell they soul, go against they guy 
 Fuck niggas, playin' like they real, living in disguise 
 Homie what you know? 
 (Rich Homie Quan) 
 I know, I know, I know 
 I know, I know, I know (What you know Quan?) 
 You ain't that nigga you say you is (Well how you know though?) 
 Just know that I know, I know, I know (Okay!) 
 Them streets, they fuck with me strong 
 And them bitches gon fuck just because money long 
 You know that I know, I know, I know 
 Well you know that I know it, I know it, I know
