(Chorus: woman singing - repeat 4X) 
 Take a look in my life and see what I see... 
 (Yo Gotti) 
 M-E-M-P-H-I-S 
 3 - 8 - 1 - 2 - 7 
 Shady vista, segshaw lane 
 My ghetto game, where it all started for gotti 
 Little summin', running around (?) and naughty 
 Asking for dollars from niggaz I assumed was ballin' 
 Twelve years old, and talking about flippin' tomorrow 
 Counting my cheese, think I had 'bout 37 bones 
 I made up my mind, tomorrow gotti's starting to cone 
 Bought me a deal, posted up on top of the hill 
 Throughout these years, I've seen a lot of niggaz get killed 
 My life is the truth, I'd rather rap outside a booth 
 Y'all ain't talking about shit, I'm 100 proof... 
 That's what my life like 
 (Yo Gotti) 
 I'm from the projects, jaded in, fence surround 
 I'm a normal teen black, but these chinks around 
 'Cause they on the corner stores, like how could they afford 
 Something we can't, they never seen these dollars before 
 I wrote this here for the government, me and my people sufferin' 
 Break bread with the immigrants, not word for recipients 
 Tell me what my benefit, long jazz, fifty cents 
 Eighty-five percent with no parole in parenthesis 
 The north memphis president, here to set the record straight 
 Rob, steal, kill, put some food on your people plates 
 Going lethal, thrill me, before these people kill me 
 Gotti's just a spokesman for the north and they gon' feel me 
 My block consists of... lost hope 
 Gangbangers and street-thugs... plus coke 
 There's one way in and one way out, take summin' 
 A cop working; wait for drought, like yo gotti 
 (Yo Gotti) 
 Back in the day, used to cut the five off of twenties 
 Back in the day, I used to cut the two off of tens 
 Back in the days, I thought everybody was friends 
 Back in the day, the hood had me trapped within 
 Back in the day, used to play "pick up and run" 
 The shit was fun, but nowadays we picking up guns 
 Back in the day, me and my niggaz fought with each other 
 Shared with each other, but nowadays we bust at each other 
 Trust in each other just like we done sealed-up leather 
 Never, we're all clever but on different levels 
 Back in the day, used to play "that's my car" 
 Back in the days, I never thought I'd make it this far 
 Back in the day, used to play "catch a girl, get a girl" 
 Nowadays, niggaz let a girl ruin they whole world 
 Last days, it was existing in the dirty south 
 Rediculous in the dirty south, come get me out this dirty south 
 My life like... 
 (Chorus) - repeat to fade
