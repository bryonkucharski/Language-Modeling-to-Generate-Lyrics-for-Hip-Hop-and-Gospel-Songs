My soulmAnnotateate, my kid's mother 
 My better half, my baby mama 
 My down bitch, my clan partner 
 She a bitch when I get mad, my lil' doctor 
 Put my pride to the side fuck you heard a nigga

 How could I leave you shawty? You put in work for niggas 
 Fed time on the line you hold in work for niggas

 Fuck it, but I just wanna apologize 
 I'm puttin' my pride to the side 
 I grew up with this nigga he was like my right hand 
 We sold the packs of cocaine and robbed the weed man 
 We played the pewee football he was the best achiever 
 He was the corner back, the running back, and the wide receiver 
 On some plenty my nigga I loved him like a brother 
 It was like my mother his mother we shared the same brothers 
 And I'm getting money, 16 I had a hundred stacks 
 I heard rumors my nigga been dippin in the pack 
 Damn, my nigga been dippin in the pack 
 They say he gone into powder graduated from crack 
 I wouldn't believe it my nigga what type of shit is that? 
 Then I seen it myself, had to face the facts
