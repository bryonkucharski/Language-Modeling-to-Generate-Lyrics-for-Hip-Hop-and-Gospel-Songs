My home boy rico, fell in love wit kesha 
 Full time freak bitch part time teacher 
 Me and kesha cool cuzz I use to fuck tammy 
 That's her lil sista just moved to miami 
 Kesha was the driver when I was takin' trips to Mexico 
 Got the head once and I ain't eve fuck the hoe 
 Course I told rico now tammy can't stand me 
 Before I fucked the bitch me and him was like family 
 And kesha start hangin' round niggas couldn't trust her 
 But money over bitches that my mothefuckin brother 
 Sticking to the g-code, fuck one of these stank hoes 
 Of course I went told what she said back to rico 
 Rico gott mad as hell and start clickinq 
 Pulled his pistol out and told me stay up out his business 
 Told me he would kill me if I ever fucked his bitches 
 And he ain't pay me shit for them last five chickens 
 Rico trippin' out rico know I ain't no hoe 
 Rico know he should have killed me 
 Rico know I ain't gone go 
 Rico still fuckin' kesha, kesha still fuckin' off 
 Rico still owe me a hundred grand and plan on running off 
 Rico mama know my mama we like family rico smart 
 But if rico know what I know can't no one save him but god 
 I know rico ain't no sucka rico gutter he got heart 
 Rico murked so many niggas but his weakness is a broad 
 Now rico fuckin' tammy cuzz he wanna pay back kesha 
 Kesha wanna pay back rico, I don't give a fuck bout neither 
 This bitch kesha so fucked up she been fuckin' wit da needle 
 Gave dat bitch a couple stacks she called rico up to meet him 
 Rico walked into the house I was sittin' right on the couch 
 Rico thought he saw a ghost kesha standing right by the door 
 Rico one shot to the head, kesha screaming out he dead 
 U' know I can't leave no witness kesha pow, I fled 
 If u; a real nigga then u' stand for sumthing 
 By the way never change gotta stand for something 
 My heart made of ice and the streets made it cold 
 One thing about it I don't love these hoes
