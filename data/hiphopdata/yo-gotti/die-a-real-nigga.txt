Yeah, Gotti Montana 
 Real nigga, I'mma die a real nigga 
 I'mma die a real nigga 
 I'mma die a real nigga, I'mma die a real nigga, 
 I'mma die a real nigga, I'mma die a real nigga 
 I ain't soft on these ho's, I ain't cross on my folk, feds come and scoop me 
 My mouth staying close, so I'mma die a real nigga, I'mma die a real nigga 
 I'mma die a real nigga, I'mma die a real nigga 
 My wrist so froze, my bitch so cold, my trap so set 
 Got burglar bar doors and I'm ridin' around them porches 
 All base fish, my j's got choices 
 And every damn college, 'cause I'm hustling with these vulchers 
 Bought 10 bricks lost 3, I guess that plate cost me 
 Got niggas tryna off me, put me in a coffin 
 Mama am the plug there's some real killas they swimming with the dolphins 
 Fuck bad bitches often, kush plug in Austin 
 Serve good candy and I can't tell you what he taught me 
 But plain ain't simple I'mma die a real nigga 
 If you pussy's ever push me, I'mma blaw me a nigga! 
 I'mma die a real nigga 
 I'mma die a real nigga 
 I'mma die a real nigga, I'mma die a real nigga, 
 I ain't soft on these ho's, I ain't cross on my folk, feds come and scoop me 
 My mouth staying close, so I'mma die a real nigga, I'mma die a real nigga 
 I'mma die a real nigga, I'mma die a real nigga 
 I ain't soft on these ho's, I ain't cross on my folk, feds come and scoop me 
 My mouth staying close 
 I'm posted in the hood, I'm supposed to be on promo 
 Neighbour called I ain't answer and I got bricks for the low low 
 Parrot popped a loco, crime scene gun smoke 
 Drive by to homicide nigga what you down to die for 
 These niggas can't be trusted, bitches ain't loyal side bitch ain't getting shit 
 My main bitch spoiled, I ain't turning up with niggas, we ain't fightin over ho's 
 Ain't no bitches in my business, got killas on the road 
 Spoke nigga met em, double wrapped in tape 
 36 oz all I got is weight, fed them lil gun 
 Chopper with a drum, bury me a nigga 
 That day ever come 
 I'mma die a real nigga 
 I'mma die a real nigga 
 I'mma die a real nigga, I'mma die a real nigga, 
 I ain't soft on these ho's, I ain't cross on my folk, feds come and scoop me 
 My mouth staying close, so I'mma die a real nigga, I'mma die a real nigga 
 I'mma die a real nigga, I'mma die a real nigga 
 I ain't soft on these ho's, I ain't cross on my folk, feds come and scoop me 
 My mouth staying close 
 I'mma die a real nigga 
 I'mma die a real nigga 
 I'mma die a real nigga, I'mma die a real nigga, 
 I ain't soft on these ho's, I ain't cross on my folk, feds come and scoop me 
 My mouth staying close, so I'mma die a real nigga, my mouth staying closed 
 Mouth stayin closed, my mouth staying closed 
 I ain't cross my doggs, I ain't selling my soul, can't love you bitches 
 I don't trust you ho's
