Whole bunch of money on my mind I'm a bank teller 
 Pharmaceuticals in the trap nigga I'm a dope seller 
 Margiela thousand dollars for the tennis shoes 
 Make the money, blow the money, blow the money, make the money 
 I just blew a sack in Saks 
 Closet looking like it's Neimans 
 Smoking on that woo sipping Act got me feeling like a demon 
 Got me feeling like a monster plus I'm bumping Monster by my nigga Future 
 Met a bitch so real told her I'm marry her I can tell the future 
 Yeah bitch I'm a prophet 
 Wake up everyday and profit 
 Wake up everyday with new haters knowing niggas can't stop it 
 You a hater boy I want to thank you 
 Motivate me to get this paper 
 Motivate me to fuck your bitches thank me later 
 Million dollars and I threw it 
 Half a million on a coupe 
 2 million dollar budget I said fuck it swinging out the stu 
 I been trapping out the booth 
 Coke prices through the roof 
 Yeah the prices prices hella high high 'cause it's desert storm DJ Clue 
 Whole bunch of money on my mind I'm a bank teller 
 Pharmaceuticals in the trap nigga I'm a dope seller 
 Margiela thousand dollars for the tennis shoes 
 Make the money, blow the money, blow the money, make the money 
 In the hood giving loans 
 Investment property buying homes 
 Invest in pack that strong 
 Fuck a CP I trust no man 
 Uncle Sam I be taxing niggas then withdraw it like a ATM 
 Hood rich off of trap music but I'm popping pills bumping EDM 
 I just been moving the bank then put a [?] in the vault 
 Had to withdrew 'bout a bag money been all in my thoughts 
 Tell the security we good 
 Boy we come straight out the hood 
 We don't trust niggas with badges only fuck bitches with asses 
 Nigga late on a payment make him pay interest 
 Nigga late on the payment take 'em to the trenches 
 I can count the money backwards 
 Yeah I rap but I'm not a rapper 
 Life a movie but I'm not acting ain't no cut scenes straight action 
 Whole bunch of money on my mind I'm a bank teller 
 Pharmaceuticals in the trap nigga I'm a dope seller 
 Margiela thousand dollars for the tennis shoes 
 Make the money, blow the money, blow the money, make the money
