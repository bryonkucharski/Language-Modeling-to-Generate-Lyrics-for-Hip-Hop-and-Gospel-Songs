...Yeah this some personal shit here nigga! 
 I'ma take it there... 
 You can kiss her, You can hug her 
 You can tell her that you love her to her face bro' 
 But that bitch ain't yo bitch dawg 
 Said, that bitch ain't yo bitch dawg 
 You can lick her, You can stick her 
 You can give it to her right all night bro' 
 But that bitch ain't yo bitch dawg 
 Said, that bitch ain't yo bitch dawg 
 You can like her you can wife her 
 You can get married and fight her all night bro' 
 But that bitch ain't yo bitch dawg 
 Said, that bitch ain't yo bitch dawg 
 (Verse 1: Yo Gotti) 
 I'm the same nigga off tha chain nigga 
 I get's paid to giving game to lame niggaz 
 I learned early way back in my younger days 
 Following my heart I fell in love at seventh grade 
 Late night on the phone quality time king 
 Malco movie screens she was my queen 
 We was everything and I was so faithful 
 Fucked my homeboys and that was so hateful 
 I thought taped her 
 In denial and didn't wanna believe in the truth 
 Man but they taped her 
 Made me strong so I can live with that 
 So I gotta thank that Andrea for that 
 (Verse2: Yo Gotti) 
 How many real niggaz can stand up and tell the truth 
 Lay it all on the line when they step in the booth 
 Not that many pimpin' close to any pimpin' 
 That boy Gotti a fool that's why I'm winning pimpin' 
 Nineteen-nintey-six I was moving bricks 
 Opened my heart back up and got another bitch 
 I changed that hoe life I copped that hoe ice 
 I showed that hoe wrong I taught that hoe right 
 And she was ride or die I seen her smile and cry 
 I sent that hoe to school I made her work nine to five 
 They kicked my door in they shot my bitch up 
 The cut my whole head they stole my white stuff 
 But she was still there 'cause she did not care 
 She's a soulja man she was so real 
 I asked her one day do you know dude there 
 She said hell naw man she said she swear 
 Poseda been out of town I popped up in my home 
 Man it' was going down 
 And I ain't no damn fool 
 And it was clear to see she was fuckin' the enemy 
 She made me strong and cold-hearted for that 
 Man I gotta thank Ranarda for that
