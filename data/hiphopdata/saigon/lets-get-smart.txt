The Works of Mart 
 "Plus I'm very smart" 
 It's different 
 Just different 
 Yes, this is Saigon, yes it's Mart 
 They done dumbed it down, now let's get smart 
 They done dumbed it down, now let's get smart 
 Let's get smart "plus I'm very smart" 
 Nah Preem, I ain't come around to dumb It down 
 I done started a revolution, I ain't running now 
 'Cause I don't yab about having fun, I'm underground? 
 'Cause the industry couldn't get me to become a clown 
 Mel said don't push him 'cause he's close to the edge 
 The one to fail shit, most of them dead 
 It's ironic if have some bread to put some toast to your head 
 You just wanted to go to bed, you wanted a wanted poster instead 
 Trying to be something you're not got you fronting a lot 
 Stop using hip-hop to corrupt the block 
 This nigga preaching the life that he doesn't live 
 That ain't the fact of the matter, look what it does to the kids 
 Make them want to grow up to be drug dealers 
 Leading them down a dead end, you's a fuck nigga 
 If I can bring Pac back and send y'all to wherever he's at 
 Guess what, black people, we back 
 Yes, this is Saigon, this is Mart 
 They done dumbed it down, now let's get smart 
 They done dumbed it down, now let's get smart 
 Let's get smart, let's get smart 
 It's bigger than business, this is art 
 We done dumbed it down, now let's get smart 
 We done dumbed it down, now let's get smart 
 Let's get smart "plus I'm very smart" 
 Whoever own Worldstar's a motherfucking genius 
 'Cause he ain't paying for that content 
 Niggas grab cameras and record all this nonsense 
 Sending it to them and they get rich from advertisements and sponsors 
 All you get is a fucked up conscience 
 Of being a part of depicting your people as some kind of monsters 
 I'm from the true religion of Clark Kents 
 Big as just living as hip-hop since it was still on the park bench 
 That's why my bars strong as cigar stench 
 Deadly like Agent Orange, or AIDS, arsenic 
 Can't defend myself 'cause I'm always on offense 
 The two don't give you a clue, the nine will give y'all hints 
 This Saigon and Premier up in here (yeah, yeah) 
 And we're giving them think rap this year (yeah, yeah) 
 Selling it to them shrink rap this here 
 Hottest shit in the streets, this is heat right here 
 Yes, this is Saigon, this is Mart 
 They done dumbed it down, now let's get smart 
 They done dumbed it down, now let's get smart 
 Let's get smart, let's get smart 
 It's bigger than business, this is art 
 We done dumbed it down, now let's get smart 
 We done dumbed it down, now let's get smart 
 Let's get smart "plus I'm very smart" 
 Preem, they tried to turn the art form to popcorn 
 Long as we still rocking, that is not for long 
 I dwelled here twelve year, that's 'cause I belong 
 You drop a couple hot songs then your rocks is gone 
 How many niggas can call themselves what I did? 
 How many brothers done suffered as much as I did? 
 You see the pain whenever I lift my eyelid 
 That's why I'm not in the category as Talib 
 I give you the greatest story 'cause that's what I lived 
 When I say it's pain in my life, that's what I had 
 All right, so what, I have money now, why should I brag? 
 In the hood, they still can't afford iPads 
 Who you know just goes and switch flows 
 Like this, this the show, I have lyrics to go, you know 
 It's one thing when you're just having fun with it 
 Y'all taking that dumb shit and running with it 
 Yes, this is Saigon, this is Mart 
 They done dumbed it down, now let's get smart 
 They done dumbed it down, now let's get smart 
 Let's get smart, let's get smart 
 It's bigger than business, this is art 
 We done dumbed it down, now let's get smart 
 We done dumbed it down, now let's get smart 
 Let's get smart "plus I'm very smart" 
 "Plus I'm very smart" 
 "Plus I'm very smart" 
 "Plus I'm very smart" 
 "Plus I'm very smart"
