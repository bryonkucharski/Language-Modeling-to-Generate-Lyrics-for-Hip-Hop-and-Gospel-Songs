(Intro - Saigon) 
 Aye yo yo yo yo yo, there go that brother Bryonn Bain man 
 I heard he speak knowledge, talk to 'em 
 (Bryonn Bain) 
 I was reincarnated to be incarcerated 
 In this cage called flesh 
 Released on probation only through meditation 
 But meditation was a morse code 
 Waiting for man on the other side of the tracks 
 [?] With committing heresy against himself 
 And I was by myself in the womb 
 Like I was by myself in my tomb 
 I died free, 'cause I couldn't live life a slave 
 Now I'm back from the grave 
 In a rage to get mine, 'cause I be divine, say what? 
 Said I be divine, not just some ebonic line 
 Check my EKG sign, you'll see a circle not a line 
 'Cause I transcend space and time 
 I transcend space, and send space 
 And set space back in time
