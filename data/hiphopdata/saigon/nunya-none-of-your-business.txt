Uh huh 
 DJ Premier, the legendary 
 The Works of Mart 
 The Yardfather is here 
 I feel like I need to address some shit, know what I'm saying? 
 I feel like they prying man 
 It's nunya business 
 Why I be drinking all this Guinness 
 It's nunya business, it's nunya business 
 Who the other mothers of my kids is 
 Nunya business, it's nunya business 
 All the homicides I done witnessed 
 It's nunya business, it's nunya business 
 Nunya business, it's nunya business 
 It's nunya business 
 Weed give me ADD but I still smoke it 
 These bitches be licking my chicken but I still choke it 
 Would I be the new Chief if I kill Keef? 
 Am I the only one on Love and Hip Hop with my real teeth? 
 The only one that probably been in some real beef 
 You swear to your veneers, I knock 'em out real brief 
 So nice I feel I should shout out Lil Cease 
 On every one of my joints like I'm B-I-G's up 
 Ho sit yo ass down 
 I'm still out here shooting, you been spent your last round 
 The way that I'm moving they're saying get your cash now 
 Already been proven I'm a skitzo, just ask around 
 Acting like you know me, how? I get scared 
 The only shit you gon hear is pow pow pow 
 I'm Spring Valley smart, Newburgh tough 
 Brownsville crazy, and that should be enough 
 When it's time for me to say sayonara 
 Y'all gon be saying that Sai a martyr 
 And that I'm a lyrical fire starter 
 Yeah, I kinda sorta be lying on my dick 
 'Cause it's a lot of chicks that I hit I will not admit 
 I notice a lot of y'all be popping a lot of shit 
 Should be minding your business but vying to do the opposite 
 They even lied and said Giddy man was a titty man 
 When I don't even want more than what could fit in my hand 
 Damn, Can I Live like Jigga said? 
 Can y'all prevent me from going upside this nigga head? 
 They say you do a reality show, your stock just fall 
 I'm just glad it was Love and Hip Hop, not Lockup Raw 
 Three baby moms, trying to knock up more 
 'Cause it's some forces in the world trying to knock us all 
 I'm Los Angeles smart, New Orleans tough 
 Chitown crazy, and that should be enough 
 What type of asshole go and start trouble with a gangsta? 
 2003, we woulda called you a wanksta 
 You go to the dealership but you don't never cop nothing 
 You been hustling a long time? No, stop fronting 
 Nigga, you never sold coke in your life 
 You sold crack, you was moving them little packs to get your motorbike 
 But when you rapping, you the crack slinging prototype 
 I sold more, matter fact...
