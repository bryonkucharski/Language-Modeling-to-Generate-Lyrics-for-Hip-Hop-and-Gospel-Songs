I run with gold rhymers 
 That know dramas 
 The ghetto goldminers 
 Split a fine and roll a whole dime of trauma bid with old timers 
 Trying to perpetuate the minds of the multitude 
 Collectivism distorting they mechanisms eating they food 
 Who blunted who walk the line to find a fraud and confront it 
 Put one in his stomach 
 Run with dudes that's 22 hundred 
 Nothing change I could be probably plotting robbery 
 Never monogamy prison I wear pornography 
 Living is ideology god body illogical slugs lobotomize you 
 Demonology trapped lord more then the local fraud 
 Got hit by the board put a sword through a niggaz vocal cord 
 Jakes contemplated licking him victims was sick of him 
 Know the god creeped him but couldn't peep the curriculum 
 Fake scarred in tri-state it wasn't hard to migrated 
 Y'all niggaz got ate broke down to a carbohydrate 
 I'm the veteran only nigga I ain't never met a nigga better then 
 Lyrically hitting you in your head again 
 Fuck Exced-a-rin you gon need more medicine 
 Slick raps will push your wig back like George Jefferson 
 You like me F it then you ain't got to represent 
 Real niggaz know Saigon flow is excellent 
 Shit is mad evident why you think niggaz is giving us all these dead presidents 
 When we criminally negligent
