 Does the Lord hear a sinner's prayer? 
 When I die, if I make to the gate, will they let me into there? 
 As I look at this crook in the mirror 
 With all this dirt on my hair 
 Does the Lord hear a sinner's prayer? 
 This is a sinner's prayer 
 When I die, if I make to the gate, will they let me into there? 
 As I look at this crook in the mirror 
 With all this dirt on my hair 
 Does the Lord hear a sinner's prayer?

 If they wishin' to be dishonest 
 I think they got they mission accomplished 
 We still don't know the real definition of Congress 
 I love the Obamas-Barack and Michelle 
 But it's been five years, my block still hot as hell 
 Ain't nobody else gon' say it, I might as well 
 If you don't like the beat, well, then play this shit acapell' 
 Somethin' you need to hear-I'm like the new Makavell' 
 With a lot to tell, I can change the game by myself 
 But I said, "Fuck all that, I'm finna call Pap" 
 His phone dead, left him a message to call back 
 It's all black everything, everything all black 
 Even our mind frames-we taking it all back 
 You niggas say, "Brian, you delusional 
 You read too many books in the pen, and them muhfuckers confusin' you" 
 Father, forgive me for not living so positively 
 My apologies, Lord, please, Father, forgive me

 A sinner's prayer. It's almost over-the end is near 
 Judgement Day. Didn't rush to this moment, but did prepare 
 I couldn't see through the weed smoke-it's getting clear 
 Good eyes of 20/20 vision peer 
 Always take my wife's advice that she said in the prison chair 
 'Cause the females are very observant and women stare 
 "You should fear nothin' but God." I didn't care 
 I said, "I'd rather die in courage than live in fear" 
 Lied on a stack of Bibles in court, but didn't swear 
 Both boots stand in a square of truth-I'm in a square 
 Told Rosa Parks that nigga seats are in the rear 
 Now the White House is the Black House, we livin' there 
 It's not like I had knowledge that I didn't share 
 Breathe life into the mentally dead, I give 'em air 
 Ride till the wheels fall off, a shirt the quitters wear 
 Jack it up and change that tire, we ride with a spare

 First off, here's a theory to quote 
 Tryna hide from the eyes of God is really a joke 
 No matter your area codes, just the various folks 
 Who wanna walk amongst the King, but they barely get close, and, uh 
 Masquerade with your blasphemous ways 
 Claim you masters of the universe but actually slaves 
 Those shenanigans will get you smacked in your face 
 Exposed like mannequins before they back on display-get it? 
 Instead of feeding people the truth 
 They propagandize everything you see on the news 
 Misleading the youth. But they can't imprison your mind 
 You don't need 20/20 to see niggas is blind 
 [?] From the biblical time 
 Now is that subtracting or adding to your spiritual crimes? 
 You don't wanna listen? Nigga, close your ears 
 When you get caught up, the system will divulge your fears
