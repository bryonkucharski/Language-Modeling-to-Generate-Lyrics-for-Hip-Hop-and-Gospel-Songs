(Saigon) 
 When I first met you I thought that you and I was friends to the end 
 People told me men you befriended just went to the pen 
 But I ain't listen to them, cause you promised 
 As long as I fuck with you I never be in the same position again 
 Like you said they just jealous 'cause we gone get rich and they not 
 They work a lot, we play the block, still got more than they got 
 Cousin guzzling henny high, people say if I keep fucking with you 
 I subsequently die, end up with twenty five 
 They claiming you claim many lives, with semi nines 
 With guys, innocent ladies, babies of any size 
 Nah I knew it wasn't the truth, 'cause they ain't have nothing for proof 
 They even blamed you for dozens of youths of substance abuse 
 What kinda crap is that? Everybody knows that crackers bought crack to our habitat 
 To attack the Latins and Blacks, never mind that fact, something I know is wrong 
 You was there when my hopeless mom put me out in the coldest storm 
 Even though you did introduce me to smoking tron 
 And so it was, you welcome Saigon with open arms 
 That's all I could focus on, the reason I wrote this explosive song 
 To show even the closest bond, gets torn 
 You tricked me all along, you had me thinking you was my friend 
 You never loved Saigon 
 With friends like you who needs enemies 
 Brought a nigga bad luck like the Kennedys 
 You had a nigga ass up in the penitentiary 
 With friends like you who needs enemies

 Not only smoking Newport cigs and guzzling whole 40's wit one swig 
 You taught the kid more than any school in New York did 
 Teachers teaching me social studies, but wasn't there for Saigon to cry on after the wakes of my closest buddies 
 I was grew up, I depicted this picture too up, was I just a fool or just too young 
 Or strung on the booze that you brung 
 Snatch my soul, put a hole in it, grab my mind took control of it 
 Made my heart as cold as the home of the Bolsheviks 
 Funny when you wasn't around it wasn't no incidents 
 Let you tell it, all of that was simply coincidence 
 That's a thesis I doubt, 'fore I met you I wasn't kick Theresas eye out 
 Or had the police at my house, I wouldn't have needed ki's to fly south 
 Murder rap would never ease from my mouth, I probably be at peace with myself 
 Probably think what you did to me was sweet, laughing at me like Kee-Kee-Kee for falling for your trickery and deceit 
 Don't flatter yourself, it don't take a genius to spell thug 
 Convince a kid at the mere age of twelve to sell drugs 
 If you really had g, you'd have them white kids like you had me 
 It was they great granddaddies that created you Daddy 
 They was the ones that flooded you with gats and liquor stores 
 Macs, pimps with the whores, that trade cash for intercourse 
 And of course these young niggas stay sucking you off 
 But I know the truth, so poof; I'm cutting you off 
 You did this to me 
 You did this to me, man 
 You know what? A lot of times we grow up thinking the streets is our friend 
 You know what I'm sayin' 
 The streets ain't your motherfucking friend young blood 
 Take it from me, man, I been in the streets my whole motherfucking life 
 And I ain't get nothin' but pain, death, jail...
