(Feat. Nas) 
 (Chorus: singing) 
 There's a war in the streets tonight 
 And nobody's really feelin' all right 
 I got a blunt for my chronic, a juice for my tonic 
 I know now... 
 So I know we'll be all right 
 Saigon: 
 When niggas tell you don't hurt nobody they being funny 
 When they say its Saigon they mean its money 
 Ever since I was little bitches say he a dummy 
 Because one year I went to church and beat up the Easter bunny 
 Everyday I thank god with silent pray 
 So he can help me resolve some of my violent ways 
 I was locked up for four hundred holidays 
 I was in the peezee when I heard Easy E and Dr. Dre 
 Was in the pen for that bad boy death row thing 
 I was locked away when Dre was crowned west coast king 
 I'm the thug these rappers trying to be 
 Lyrically I'm a fuckin' anomaly 
 You as much of a rapper as Sean John and me 
 Matter of fact you an actor like Sean Connery 
 I'm the nigga wit the rap sheet longer then your rap book 
 Hustlers got their chain snatched and they got their crack took 
 (Chorus: singing) 
 There's a war in the streets tonight 
 And nobody's really feelin' all right 
 I got a blunt for a chronic, a juice for my tonic 
 I know now... 
 So I know we'll be all right 
 Nas: 
 Yeah, Nine-four, Destiny opens her eyes 
 For the first time, praise God, baby mom's cryin' 
 Planned to be a strong black family 
 But we both were too young, too strung, too much flashin' 
 New come, I caught verbal assassin runnin' with 
 Nothin' but the worst type, worst fight 
 But we brought my baby home the first night 
 Cursed like sailors, burst out the crib 
 Ragin' in my new car bought from entertainment 
 Champaign and gainin' clout fast, whiplash 
 Did this bitch just pass in the club pugged up, stupid ass 
 Grabbed her by the pony tail, "never disrespect me" 
 I'm a street vet, regret the sex, but not Desi 
 Moved back to your grandma, I'm single, the land's mine 
 She keeps the Benz, I'm all in the streets again 
 Squeezin' the pen, released again, chart toppers, 
 Hard-bottoms blessed the feet, now less baby mom's problems 
 New woman, she's great, this a different world, 
 Checkin' out my wife's chemistry with my little girl 
 It's so amazin' playin', life is so crazy 
 I've grown up the thankful for lessons God gave me 
 (Chorus: singing) 
 There's a war in the streets tonight 
 And nobody's really feelin' all right 
 I got a blunt for a chronic, a juice for my tonic 
 I know now that I'm feelin' right if it goes down 
 'Cause my third eye sees the lowdown 
 And I know it's not my time to go now 
 'Cause God's got my back in this showdown 
 So I know we'll be all right
