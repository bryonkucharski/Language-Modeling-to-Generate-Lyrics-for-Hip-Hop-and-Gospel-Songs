 "I remember one time I was over at my Auntie house 
 Spending the night. And we playin' Super Nintendo 
 I hear this lady: 'Yo, I heard you been looking for me, nigga' 
 Then she just -- boom-boom-boom-boom-boom! 
 She let off about eight shots. Then I heard the other gun fire off 
 And we were just still there playing there, like nothin' happened 
 And then Vietnam, them people came back crazy. I (live) in Vietnam 
 So what you think I'ma be if I live in it and they just went and visited?" 
 Suckas can't survive without philosophyin' 
 When somebody dies you see why I'm not surprised 
 Had a plot to rise since I looked into the doctors eyes 
 Since I started drinking milk that was homogenized 
 I was strived with or without a pops to provide 
 Mom still cries 'cause she fell for a crock of lies 
 I try to teach her to fight her fears 
 I try to teach her to wipe her tear 
 Don't worry, shit gon' be a'ight this year 
 I'm at the top of my game, just watch for my name 
 Better off popping my brain than poppin' my chain 
 I claim king without dropping a thing 
 When they ask if I'm best I reminisce to the banging' 
 (LeAlan Jones) 
 When I was ten, I seen my first automatic weapon 
 A Glock Nine -- two clips 
 (Lloyd Newman) 
 I seen all kinds of guns -- .44, .22, (Techs!) Techs. I saw rifles 
 [Jones:] Mac 10, Mac 11 
 [Newman:] Living around here. You hear shooting all the time 
 Damn... 
 The drama's pitiful, little niggas is homicidical 
 Couple meals ago shorty was eating through his umbilical 
 Now he feel he unkillable 
 Shit is all amazing 
 The wrong altercation will leave his ass with a long abrasion 
 I try to make my life the focal through rhyme 
 These niggas do vocal booth crime 
 I shot niggas multiple times 
 You sold a few dimes 
 But when you rapping, you the crack king 
 I sold it to whites when you thought it was just a black thing 
 I'm filled with this realness, rappers happen to lack it 
 I'm flabbergasted you got a platinum plaque for that whack shit 
 All the real gangsters, they're on their way to being dead or in jail 
 They don't make records to sell 
 (Lloyd Newman) 
 I asked my father, Chill, what his best memories of my mother are 
 ('Chill') 
 Me and her have fun, putting our feet in the water together 
 We were sober then... but once we started gettin' high... 
 Them memories gone... They gone 
 [Newman:] Why are you drinking? 
 [Chill:] I don't understand why I'm drinking 
 [Newman:] Do you think you're gonna stop? 
 [Chill:] Yeah, I'm going to rehab, and take care of myself 
 [Newman:] What do you drink? 
 [Chill:] I drink about two or three pints of wine a day 
 But it ain't helping me, ain't doin' nothin' but killing me 
 Don't people understand it's destroying you? 
 [Newman:] If it's destroying you, why do you still drink? 
 Do you think you've been a good father? 
 [Chill:] Yes, I have, to the best capability I could 
 [Newman:] I have no further questions 
 The drama's pitiful, little niggas is homicidical 
 Couple meals ago shorty was eating through his umbilical 
 Now he feel he unkillable 
 Shit is all amazing 
 The wrong altercation will leave his ass with a long abrasion 
 I try to make my life to focal through rhyme 
 These niggas do vocal booth crime 
 I shot niggas multiple times 
 You sold a few dimes 
 But when you rapping, you the crack king 
 I sold it to whites when you thought it was just a black thing 
 I'm filled with this realness, rappers happen to lack it 
 I'm flabbergasted you got a platinum plaque for that whack shit 
 All the real gangsters, they're on their way to being dead or in jail 
 They don't make records to sell 
 They don't make records to sell 
 They don't make records to sell 
 They don't make records to sell 
 They don't make records to sell 
 They don't make records to sell
