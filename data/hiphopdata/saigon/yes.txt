She moved into my old apartment 
 That's how we got this whole thing started 
 She called and said that I had mail waiting there for me 
 I told her that I'd come and get it 
 How could I know in just a minute 
 That I'd be standing face to face with my own destiny 
 Oh, and we sat there talkin' just like we were old friends 
 Oh, then I ask her can I see you again 
 She said, ?Yes? 
 ?N I said wow 
 I said how about right now 
 Love can't wait 
 ?N I asked if she believed in fate 
 And she said, ?Yes? 
 The days flew by like a fast train 
 Nothin' else has been on my brain 
 Except the thought of how she makes me the man I want to be 
 She's the one I want for a million reasons 
 And loving her is just like breathin' 
 It's easy and it's obvious she was made for me 
 Oh, then it happened one night lookin' into her eyes 
 And when I popped the question much to my surprise 
 She said, ?Yes? 
 ?N I said wow 
 I said how about right now 
 Love can't wait 
 ?N I asked if she believed in fate 
 And she said, ?Yes? 
 So I called the preacher, family, and friends 
 And nothin's been the same since 
 She said, ?Yes? 
 ?N I said wow 
 I said how about right now 
 Love can't wait 
 ?N I asked if she believed in fate 
 And she said, ?Yes?
