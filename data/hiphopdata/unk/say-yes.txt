Baby girl, all you gotta do is say yes 
 Come get with me and I'll relieve your stress 
 Whatever your problems might be 
 Come and get with me 
 And get it off your chest 
 Baby girl, all you gotta do is say yes 
 Come get with me and I'll make it worth your while 
 Get in between and be trippin' with a smile 
 Let me make you feel so right! 
 Wazzup ma, how you doin'? 
 24 in the waist; that's how you do it? 
 Rockin' them sell with the waistline low 
 The kind I like, that let the crack show 
 I ain't neva' did shit but rob a pocket for a ho 
 Between me and you, this shit's gettin' old 
 I could see me and you, in this grill, 
 Or ridin' shotgun while you whippin' the wheel 
 Come take a trip 
 With your boy Unk, I want what you want 
 Don't be talking about what you don't 
 Open that bottle; shots of patron 
 Let's get it on 
 Foreplay my way and she bumpin' my song 
 5 in the morn' 
 She holla' one more round before lickin' my cone 
 Y-E-S 
 I could take away your stress 
 I say Y-E-S 
 I could take away your stress 
 Baby girl, all you gotta do is say yes 
 Come get with me and I'll relieve your stress 
 Whatever your problems might be 
 Come and get with me 
 And get it off your chest 
 So wazzup ma, is you down and wet? 
 I can see it in your eyes that you ready to cut 
 Meet me at the crib if you ready to cut 
 The lights down low if you stressin' for what 
 If your car messed up, you can borrow one of mine 
 You got credit card debt, you can borrow one of mine 
 Just say yes; you can have a piece of mine 
 That nigga ain't ready, I told the Glock 9 
 And if the show don't 
 Blowin' kush, we can do it in slo-mo 
 From the front to the back if you say so 
 Just don't say no 'cause I'm feelin' you 
 Four Five 'cause your eyes got me hypnotized 
 Thick thighs, you don't wanna' come and get your prize 
 And that's you and me, in a life of luxury 
 Say yes and that's just how it's gonna' be 
 Baby girl, all you gotta do is say yes 
 Come get with me and I'll relieve your stress 
 Whatever your problems might be 
 Come and get with me 
 And get it off your chest 
 Baby girl, all you gotta do is say yes 
 Come get with me and I'll make it worth your while 
 Get in between and be trippin' with a smile 
 Let me make you feel so right! 
 Baby girl, don't lie to me 
 I know you wanna do it 
 Saw the way that you were lookin' when we was cruisin' 
 I know I ain't the type to buy you a tulip 
 Give you a blunt and weed; let's get woozy 
 Don't say maybe, 'cause I ain't askin' you to be my lady 
 Might as well say yes and you get another sex, roughed up; 
 With our clothes, we'll make it 
 2 in the one, now you beggin me 
 But it's all good 
 Just hear me out, I reply "Hell yeah" 
 Tell me the truth, but shawty can you take it 
 I think you can... no, I know you will 
 Wait and chill, I'm just bein' real 
 Sit back, relax, now tell me shawty 
 How do you think you wanna' 
 Be my girl (Yeah) 
 So you wanna' be my queen (Yeah) 
 All you gotta do is agree 
 But I can't promise a damn thang 
 Just get down (damn bitch) 
 Baby girl, all you gotta do is say yes 
 Come get with me and I'll make it worth your while 
 Get in between and be trippin' with a smile 
 Let me make you feel so right!
