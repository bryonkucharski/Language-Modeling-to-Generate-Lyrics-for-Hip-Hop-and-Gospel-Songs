 And if a hata buck let's fuck they ass up

 I'm watchin' niggas posted mixin' fruits and goose togetha' 
 I keep that black beretta I call dat bitch my heater 
 And if you play me close just like a bitch man Imma ski cha' 
 Dem westin twins will meet cha' can greet cha' like a feature 
 And change up all ya features call da Red Cross to treat cha'
