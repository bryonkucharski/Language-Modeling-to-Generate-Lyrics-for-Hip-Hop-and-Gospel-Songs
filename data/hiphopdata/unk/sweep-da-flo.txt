She put her hands on her knees 
 And she drop it down low 
 She poked out her booty 
 And she made it sweep da flo 
 She sweep da flo, sweep, sweep da flo 
 Sweep da flo, sweep, sweep da flo

 Sweep da flo, sweep, sweep da flo 
 Damn, looky here looky here 
 Let me whisper somethin' in your ear 
 You the baddest thing up in here

 Get down [Incomprehensible] beer 
 Ye hoe don't have no fear 
 I wanna get with you my dear 
 Sweep the flo hoe wit yo rear 
 She sexy, exotic, bootylicious 
 She got it, I want it, how 'bout it 
 How much money in your wallet 
 Sweep da flo drop it down real low 
 Shake that ass till you can't no more 
 Make you work like a certified pro 
 Go baby, go baby go, low baby, low baby low 
 Sweep, sweep, sweep da flo 
 In this club on dro and shots of patron 
 One more day and we gone 
 Poke it all night, pop it all night 
 Get low bitch sweep the whole house 
 Yeah, you know what it is 
 Sweep da flo, let the freaks come out 
 She put her hands on her knees 
 And she drop it down low 
 She poked out her booty

 Sweep da flo, sweep, sweep da flo 
 She sweep da flo, sweep, sweep da flo

 Shit, shit make some room 
 The bitch comin' through and I'mma call her broom 
 Sweep the flo till the shit gets swept 
 Shorty by herself she don't need no help 
 She hard and she'll run a pompoo off the yard 
 She whip, whip, whip, whip 
 On a face make a nigga say, yeah 
 Make good and ask for her number 
 I wonder if she wanna be my baby mamma 
 Got this nigga drunk 
 Jumpin' all money by the mother fucking trunk 
 She a badass yellow bitch 
 In the club every night doin' that nasty shit 
 If you wanna see her bend over and touch them toes 
 In the booty club where you need to go 
 You wanna see the bitch get nude 
 And pop that pussy with attitude 
 Put titties in your face like suck it 
 Then shake it on your dick like fuck it 
 Little mamma ain't scared 
 But you gotta be spinnin' that bread 
 Look, you gotta make it rain on the hoe 
 Then watch her scoop somebody off their toes 
 She put her hands on her knees 
 And she drop it down low 
 She poked out her booty 
 And she made it sweep da flo 
 She sweep da flo, sweep, sweep da flo 
 Sweep da flo, sweep, sweep da flo 
 She sweep da flo, sweep, sweep da flo 
 Sweep da flo, sweep, sweep da flo
