Yo what up though 
 Ya' listenin' to Elmatic 
 Fire that weed up and put it in the air 
 Represent, represent (x4) 
 [Verse One]: 
 Straight up shit is real and and any day could be your last when you pass 
 Your sand has dropped now your hourglass in the flash 
 The corners is where they pitch rock 
 To move into a rich block 
 Find somebody up in your crib 
 You gotta' switch locks 
 Niggas pull triggers and ditch Glocks 
 Over things a bitch jock 
 As sick as a Hitchcock flick 
 To be a big shot, looks appealing 
 The life of crooks getting money off the books, fuck a shook civilian 
 We took the illing and mistook the feeling 
 Of climbing to the top, stay in when you don't know where the cops laying 
 Loaded guns, pop, spraying 
 Just to get the hands on your clock to stop swaying 
 Enough to cause both of your knees to drop praying and niggas stop playing 
 'Cause I was told to represent 
 By OG's claiming the D and repping Flint 
 Pushing old school whips on 20s they kept in tint 
 [Verse Two]: 
 They call me El, I'm not your legal type of fella 
 Bong smoker, pipe inhaler, keep a strong poker 
 Face, playing my cards right, fuck a case 
 Cops will run in your place for hard white, treat you wrong, poke ya 
 With the night stick 
 I know these snitches telling in fact 
 I'm smelling a rat and the aroma is quite thick 
 They shut down your light lick bright quick 
 Charging you with shit that might stick 
 Thought you was Frank White slick 
 The jokes on 
 All you little niggas with locs on 
 Counting your figures, downing liquors, getting your smokes on 
 Representing 
 For the hood putting your city on the map 
 Young girls throw they kitty and they titties on your lap 
 Catch you slipping while you tricking 
 Stick the clip in, to get paid and leave you sicker than that AIDS symptom 
 They play your man like fools, feel the heat from the tools 
 Empty your wallet take off your jewels, you know the rules 
 [Verse Three]: 
 No doubt 
 See my stacks is fat, this is what it's about 
 Before that Ice Cube conflict with MC Ren 
 Around the time when 3rd Bass was dissed by X-Clan 
 I used to wake up every morning with my ear in a box 
 Bumping Rakim, Kane, Finesse, Freddie Foxxx 
 Then I bought the Nas CD, Biggie and Pacs 
 Wu-Tang, Jay-Z, GangStarr and the Lox 
 Now-a-days I need the greening of cash just like the next man 
 Using my mind to make shit move, just like an X-Man 
 I'm talking checks, grands, commas and zeros 
 Growing up, my heroes palm firearms at dineros 
 Some of them went to jail, got life in the cell 
 Others got death, dwelling in Hell, most of 'em fail 
 When you laying low and the police is hot on your trail 
 Do you think of suicide or are you plotting for bail? 
 This is words of wisdom from El 
 Try to rise up above 
 Keep an eye out for snakes, represent, one love
