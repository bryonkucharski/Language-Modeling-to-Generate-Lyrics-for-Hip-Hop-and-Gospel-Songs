(Intro: ElZhi) 
 Let's keep it real yo and count this money 
 Put the Grants up in the safe 'cause we spendin' the Jacksons 
 Washington's go to wifey, that's what it's all about right 
 (Verse 1: Royce da 5'9") 
 Visualizin' the realism of life in actuality 
 Everything I write is like a fatality 
 I'm a pattern-punishing painter with a pen 
 Got a style kinda like sodomy 'cause I'm anal with the way I get it in 
 I'm a maneuver with the mic, like Drano 
 Moving through a pipe, I'm insane-o 
 You can lose your life, I'm biblical with this lyrical ability 
 Respected I'm here to get rid of these records 
 Get checks and fill up facilities 
 I ain't sounding like no man 
 I ain't holding no dynamite, I just got dynamite in both hands 
 Nigga this is Elmatic 
 I'm with a chick with her tail tatted 
 She at Chanel baggin', pill addict 
 Ill, I'm still at it 
 For real status and you gon' be a vegetable unless you got you a steel cabbage 
 I woke up early in the mornin' 
 Dressed in black yawnin' said two of the best is back 
 Early in the mornin' 
 Dressed in black yawnin' said two of the best is back 
 Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we get high 
 Cause you never know when you're gonna go 
 Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we puff lye 
 Cause you never know when you're gonna go 
 Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we get high 
 Cause you never know when you're gonna go 
 Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we puff lye 
 (Verse 2: Elzhi) 
 I got rhymes 365 days annual plus some 
 Get a rush from how they bust, swear they was leakin' puss from 
 I don't deal with hoes nor trust scum 
 And treat money like pussy, if I fuck it off then it must come (cum) 
 I stay fixed on lines that make your mind play tricks 
 When they mix, even my basics sound like The Matrix 
 I'm more vivid than Michael Bay flicks 
 What I say tricks, then it lay clicks to rest like God after day six 
 They left fallin' from missin' they opportunity 
 At the door nor death's callin now they breath's stallin' 
 And who could touch me, fuck who you read about 
 And haters, I weed 'em out the same way I do my dutchie 
 I'm a maniac on track the way a train react 
 With smart bombs for dummies 
 And Dum Dums for braniacs 
 They only have a few minutes of fame 
 They caught flame and my pen is to blame 
 I get it in when you pretend it's a game 
 The way racquetball and tennis became the game's finish 
 Nine outta ten is exchange 
 And I'm tremendous, it goes without sayin' 
 With my pen insert, it's sort of introvert 
 It's not about playin' 
 (Stokley Williams) 
 The time has come for us to stop messin' around 
 Cause once you know that I like having you around in my life 
 Oh baby 
 So many times I want to hold you 
 I want to say I love you softly in your ear 
 Oh baby 
 Don't keep runnin' 
 My heart is yearning for your love 
 Keep runnin' 
 Can't keep runnin' in and outta my life
