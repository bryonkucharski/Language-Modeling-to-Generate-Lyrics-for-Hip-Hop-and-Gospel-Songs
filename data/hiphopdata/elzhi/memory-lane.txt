(Verse 1: Elzhi) 
 I'm trying to get to memory lane 
 But wonder should I take the train of thought 
 Or hop on a mental plane 
 I don't stay far, but this a place you can't get to in your car 
 Travel, standing still, it's bizarre; but there you are 
 Like you never left, back in junior high with your report card 
 Trying to make a B out the letter F 
 Maybe that was me around the time that my brother was six 
 Before I got my first job and my mother was sick 
 It's like she never needed chemo, her hair looks long, flowing 
 Sometimes it feels wrong going 
 But then every corner that you slung 
 Hung with all your dead homies slung 
 But now they got breath in their lungs 
 Looking forever young, before they were stressed 
 In here they only dress in nothin' less than Guess 
 Timberland, Tommy Hil, Rockports, and a Pelle 
 I reach down and grab a beeper while I'm searching for my celly 
 Damn did I hear Bump and Grind that was the jam at the reunion with the fam 
 In front of the cam, I'm trying to kick it with my first chick 
 I used mom's Infinity 
 This will be the twelfth time I lose my virginity 
 Shit was the truth, I left and I stopped up at the Hip-Hop Shop Seen 'Tin, Dilla, and Proof 
 Bugz, Bad Vibes, and Grym, T3 when he was slim 
 Watchin' La Peace battle Eminem 
 Soon they handed me the mic to spit a rhyme and a verse 
 I was shocked to see the clock show the time in reverse 
 But I ain't wanna leave 
 Without hittin' my first blunt filled with chronic leaves 
 I choked up and couldn't breathe 
 That's the day I missed class, smellin' like twist grass 
 Mrs. Nash kicked me out because I'm not a kiss ass 
 So I visited places where spots got shot on a daily basis 
 Where kids pull triggers with babyfaces 
 Wait, I must be on the wrong side of the lane trail 
 Where they rob memory banks and end up in the brain cell 
 Where all my misery and pain dwell 
 I'm said to leave out my state of mind before the train bail 
 So now it's time to go 
 I threw the deuces up to Dilla, dapped up 'Tin and then I hug my mama slow 
 Yo 
 It's the place you wanna be, right 
 Next time I think I'll take the mental plane 
 Instead of the train of thought 
 Hopefully touch down 
 In a state in my mind, but I'll leave the mental baggage in the crib 
 Get back to that place 
 In Memory Lane
