Settle down class, take your seats 
 Pull out the manual and turn to chapter three 
 We about to learn the lesson on color schemes 
 You ready? Here we go 
 Okay, kids, today we learn the color schemes 
 Like purple hearts, black clouds, yellow submarines 
 Can't go wrong if you listen to the song when it's on 
 Listen to the song, sing along to the (Colors) 
 Damn, it's fucked up how they found Tune 
 He was robbed for his gold chain in front of a brown stone 
 But what's a fellow to do if he not earning one red cent 
 Or trying to make the green like mixing yellow with blue 
 Oh no, it's true another black on black 'cause it's lynch fly 
 That's what I heard, word get around like the pink eye 
 Watch out when your enemies sneak by 
 Wish I could pour white out on these lines before the ink dry 
 Okay, kids, since now we learning color schemes 
 From Red Cross, blue shields, yellow submarines 
 Can't go wrong if you listen to the song when it's on 
 Listen to the song, sing along to the (Colors) 
 Now there's some that's dead from fighting over breadcrumbs 
 Feet and head numb, it's a murder, we call it red rum 
 Got them boys in blue with black jacks locking the new youth 
 They sell purples through Blackberries with the Blue tooth 
 Saw this gold digger red bone I knew poising in Black Tail 
 Another black girl lost inside the world of Black Male 
 And white collar crime done on the sneak tip 
 Different from blue collar workers catching the pink slip 
 Yo, red, yellow, orange, green, brown, white, black 
 Pink, purple, grey, blue, now let us bring it right back 
 Blue, grey, purple, pink, black, white, brown 
 Green, orange, yellow, red, now let us break it back down to the (Colors) 
 I think it's quite foul while I sip the Grey Goose and orange juice 
 And twist a white widow in a White Owl 
 How first you painting the town red beneath the night skies 
 Now you going to trail telling little white lies 
 It gives a mother the blues to see drama 
 Printed in black and white on papers that cover the news 
 And read some dudes in a white tee was laying in old piss 
 A victim of a drive-by, they even killed his goldfish 
 Okay, kids, we done learning color schemes 
 Using words like white horse, yellow submarine 
 Can't go wrong if you listen to the song when it's on 
 Listen to the song, sing along to the
