Yeah, it's Elmatic, check 
 Yo let me start you from the Genesis far from where the finish is 
 No role models just empty bottles of Guinnesses 
 Roaches in the ash tray toss and gettin' fast cash the 
 Ski mask way for those who never passed class 
 Born inside of poverty 
 Probably they stack bread and crackheads never looked alive to me 
 Robberies and liquor stores tricks and whores 
 Reality was sick as yours so I blow trees stronger than sycamores 
 Now wait, let me get back to my past 
 As I rewind mine, before I got on the 1-9-9-9 
 Mother gave birth to this divine mind 
 Born with this arm, leg, leg, arm head like a Quran line 
 No paternity but as I'm turnin' three I learnt to be 
 Strong, pops moved along and he never returned to me 
 Thought I'd feel anger for an eternity 
 I bottled my feelings inside with 
 Pride is never swallowed followed 
 By killers they rise ride off of endo 
 Bustin' off cartridges through your window 
 Different from the one from my Nintendo 
 That line shoulda been my intro, here's when I started rappin' 
 Lookin' up to younger thugs with they heart at trappin' 
 Starter cappin' fly wheels 
 Thick chicks in high heels tellin' me my skills is sick 
 I was only eight slowly fate took its turn 
 I'm where hookers earn, money and drugs sell, it ain't hard to tell 
 Check, I went to Peck Elementary, Lesenger, Cody 
 To graduate I had to take a semester with homies 
 Too busy writin' none of my time went into my assignments 
 Jot a line as my rhyme schemes maneuver like the Heimlich 
 Use to ditch class for bitch ass 
 Picture me a lot shorter my vocal pitch sound like it switch fast 
 Young and rebellious, hangin' with failures who L twist, the eldest 
 See me saggin' that's what my belts is 
 That's round the same time my mother is ill 
 Collecting mental scars waitin' for the others to heal 
 No one saw the vision everyone's beyond blind 
 Can't think about finding the meaning of life when tryin' to define mine 
 I won't pretend its cool, was wet behind the ears 
 So I had to jump in this pool graduate and finish school 
 Niggas was mad that I owned a diploma they was just sleepin' 
 They shoulda slept till they domes in a coma 
 I'm that bad shorty who been through the land of Berry Gordy 
 With a buddha man that grew a grand but gained 40 
 That ain't rich in all my hell I wasn't born with a silver spoon 
 Just a wooden one upon my kitchen wall 
 Now I rock shows from Cali Groves down to Wichita 
 Feelin' like a grew ten feet a couple inches tall 
 Just thinkin' back what was to doubt about my view sunny 
 Now it seems too funny cause even new money gets counted out 
 Nobody believed, only ones was J Barb or JAE.B Group 
 Money investments everyday be cool 
 You thought I fell, it ain't hard to tell
