Hey-hey, I like her, isn't that how it starts? 
 She feel the same y'all came together but you're now apart 
 Since it went sour tart, you got a coward heart 
 You're never giving up, thinking all the while it's smart 
 It made you ice cold cause you gambled and your dice rolled 
 Snake eyes that make guys play, when they twice old 
 And you thought that you would never trust again 
 Thinking they're good just for lust and sin and not for busting in 
 And like the other players where they take us to their lair 
 Then you lay her, there's not a special person in your prayers 
 Going through women, some thick, a few slim and 
 Busting out their shirts, others out their blue denim 
 And there's a lot of fish in the sea, where you swimming 
 That you could fetch but wouldn't think they were a good catch 
 Till one day that fly one comes along 
 You think of her off an R&B cut, then hum the song 
 And get the feeling, feeling numb is wrong 
 When she's away, you miss her like when the summer's gone 
 The place where this coming from is strong and you trying to fight it 
 Delighted, when she come around hot and you're excited 
 They say you can feel real love when you first sight it 
 Also known as the gift and the curse silent 
 Get bit by the bug, coping, show a few the symptoms 
 You fall in love but just before you fell, you were tripping 
 Meaning you were slipping then you got opened 
 And told her everything, through your body language, it was not spoken 
 You out with her it's like you never call your hoes 
 Give her the tallest rose, y'all hit the mall for shows 
 You stop going to bars where a baller goes to pop bottles 
 With top models and take off all her clothes 
 You're still in denial but you're building a smile 
 When she say she, feeling your style 
 Cause baby girl, you got that glow 
 Very, very far from a hood rat and not that ho 
 I'm saying you could spot that, yo 
 Make you wanna plot at getting her, she's hot that show 
 Cause baby girl got that, got that... something special 
 When we uh-uh, your vessel becomes a pretzel 
 And when you be gone I be missing your bond 
 Very fond, you make a heart exist in a don 
 I know that you're feeling me, it's all inside your kisses 
 Said if you were my misses I would never have a mistress 
 You make a player want to put away his pimp cup 
 Cadillac, 'caine, I'll even throw my limp up 
 I was in denial, it hit me like blaow 
 When you say you feeling my style
