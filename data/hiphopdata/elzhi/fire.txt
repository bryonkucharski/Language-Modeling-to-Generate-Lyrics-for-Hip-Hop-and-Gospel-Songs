(Intro: Black Milk) 
 Elzhi, Black Milk, let's go, yeah 
 (Verse 1: Black Milk) 
 You can't mention the top five without mentioning I 
 Black and Elzhi, fire like the temperature rise 
 Limitless I'm, not even the sky's the limit to I 
 When we spit with adrenaline times ten 
 From the beginnin until the rhyme end 
 It's, no stopping, every line's mind boggling 
 Stopping your top artist, topping 'em 
 When we spit sick, naw critics love to get compliments, go 
 (Verse 2: Fatt Father) 
 A little 'gen and sodium 
 Pandemonium, sparks the fat man at the podium 
 Starts the flame on, I came to stay long 
 (Somebody call SVU!) I rape songs 
 Fatt Father collaring fake bums, like Steak-umms 
 With great guns, that'll have you covered in A1 
 Al Green told me I was hotter than cooked grits 
 And my words seem more like somethin' I cook with 
 (Hook: Black Milk) 
 'Cause it's that fire, I see the smoke rising higher 
 Hi-higher, hands to the sky, up 
 Spit fire, nope can't deny us 
 They getting liver, 'cause it's that fire 
 I see the smoke rising higher 
 Get 'em, get 'em up, get 'em higher 
 Get a cup, let me see, see you light up 
 They getting liver, 'cause it's that fire 
 (Verse 3: Danny Brown) 
 I fire up the blunt and it tastes like gumbo 
 Hit the trees hard like George in the Jungle 
 I'm a play humble 'fore I let the K rumble 
 Know you got a bitch fatty and a snitchin ass uncle 
 Brown play niggas like Funco- 
 Land tan seats in the old school sedan 
 So nigga talk sweet and the forty fifth blam 
 Hit a nigga in his back, make 'em do a handstand 
 (Verse 4: Fat Ray) 
 Look, it's Fat Ray, fireman, I'm turnin' the hose on 
 You fire up a L, we burning the whole zone 
 So you can go to hell with fire and brimstone 
 Fire with the heckler 
 Niggas is even jockin my hand gestures 
 Yes, 'cause I'm fresher than the Nantucket Nectar 
 Ain't a man fresher, we apply pressure 
 You a lie, crooked in the street, when I fire like a Vietnam veteran 
 (Verse 5: Guilty Simpson) 
 You can't extinguish my genius, release just 
 Enough to touch y'all without a just cause 
 And still build a loyal following 
 Front row at my next show hollering, witnessing overpowering 
 Lyrics, you feel it deep down, way beneath the street's ground 
 In sewer tops, we do enough, you do a lot 
 With zero reward, I'm the chairman of the board 
 Warlord, sending verb victims to the morgue 
 (Verse 6: Elzhi) 
 Till charge an ill joggin, with skill that can kill squadrons 
 We'll reveal this all in your grill, like the drill sergeant 
 Too mean, two spleens, this is daily routine 
 If you seen, holding new green, in my blue jeans 
 Knuckle every clown, always chuckle, barely frown 
 Pistol here beneath the bubble, like Huckleberry Hound 
 When I came in, bent down to strike the game and 
 They say that I'm fire, you just got fired for soundin like your flaming 
 (Outro: Black Milk) 
 If you a fan, go and fan a nigga off, yeah 
 Wave your hands, yeah, fan a nigga off, uh 
 Go ahead, just fan a nigga off, yeah 
 If you a fan, go and fan a nigga off, go!
