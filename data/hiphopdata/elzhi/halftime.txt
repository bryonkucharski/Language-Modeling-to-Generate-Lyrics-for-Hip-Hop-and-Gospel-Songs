Check me out y'all 
 It's Elzhi in your area 
 Bout to back slap and bury ya 
 (Verse 1: Elzhi) 
 Check, now let me show you how I blaze it 
 Leave niggas in amazement on ways spit 
 Shit trickier than a maze get 
 Everything I drop raw cut you like a chop saw 
 You should stop, like when a cop draw before he drop y'all 
 You get your fort crushed actin' out of sorts 
 You don't support us, you must snort dust ridin' the short bus 
 'Cause I'm an animal, scratch that I'm the manual 
 Pull out, swingin' the metal like mechanical 
 Movement, soon as the groove hits I prove that you need improvements 
 Since I'm so smooth with whatever I maneuve' with 
 And I ain't braggin' player you get your spot got 
 What I jot is hotter than the dragon's lair 
 It's only right you should show me light 
 Because the flow be tight, I wouldn't slip on a snowy night 
 I vex, now who should I bomb next 
 New schooler or an old timer like a timex 
 Simple minded with a complex 
 My glare disrupt the cameras 
 I keep promoters scratchin' their name out and tearin' up they banners 
 When I write cigars flare again 
 The bars buried in the song is bout as strong as barbarians 
 Far scarier than the Omen 
 Chicks give me dome in my home while I'm sittin' spittin' poems watchin' Conan 
 This for my real heads and paragraph addicts 
 I kill the air time impairin' the asthmatic 
 It's like that, you know it's like that 
 I'm who you internet haters want to strike at 
 Don't make me show up to your porch with a spiked bat 
 And leave your front and rear tires on your bike flat 
 Defeat and kill, delete your skill you think you sweet until 
 I cut you off and leave you in the cold like you haven't paid your heating bill 
 Fuck your squad and your street appeal 
 Eat a dilznick click fleet until my kicks is in your leader's grill 
 For real 
 It's Halftime 
 It's Halftime 
 It's Halftime 
 It's Halftime
