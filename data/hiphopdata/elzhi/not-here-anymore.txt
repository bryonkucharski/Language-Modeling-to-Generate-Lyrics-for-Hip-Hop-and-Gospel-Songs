Went to the well and made a wish 
 Pray to God I stay around 
 Tigallo love to throw his weight around 
 On the same scale they weigh the fish 
 It's just what it seems, sweet dreams are made of this 
 Holla at me if you ever been a underdog or set up a upset 
 Standing on the verge of your success 
 Steady bearing your soul to the world, you undressed 
 Surrounded by your successors and the whores you ain't fucked yet 
 That's how I was gettin' it, I don't need the limelight 
 That's young nigga shit, I'm a O.G. and the G is for gentleman 
 Yes, Phontigga spit amazon flame, watch 9th rekindle it 
 'Cause I pad verses with the wisdom of my innocence lost 
 Two brothers, two peas in a pod, two comeback seasons apart 
 Take it back to when I be in the park 
 Then rhyme till I couldn't see in the dark 
 So silly niggas betta be on ya guard 
 Long as breath is in my being, I'mma be on my job 
 With good music, got that good feel 
 A good meal, leafy greens, two veggies, protein and a starch 
 And I'm out 
 Right where I thought I'd be 
 It's another part of me 
 And the world's so sad to see 
 That I'm not here anymore 
 Wind blowing through the trees 
 Blue bull city skies, 70 degrees 
 Te' embodies a architect and when he rhyme about it 
 He body the whole alphabet, so bury me a G 
 My mama say she done enough worrying for me 
 So I'm done currying, favor what you niggas groundhog 
 And spitting that same shit, y'all Bill Murraying 
 My D.C. niggas say you bamas lack experience 
 Carolina on my mind like Steve Spurrier 
 I'm the courier, carrying the word that with these verbs 
 That nigga Phonte's a little murderous 
 See a little nervousness, and a frown cause you know deep down 
 You ain't nice, just a little courteous 
 You just running game nigga, we the fucking tournament 
 You a temporary visa to a fucking permanent, resident 
 Citizen is evident the denizens 
 Took over the big house on some Nat Turner shit 
 Shoulders back, hair tied to the fucking firmament 
 Can't be like us, and fear no man 
 Niggas bleed like us, get a fucking tourniquet, nigga 
 Right where I thought I'd be 
 It's another part of me 
 And the world's so sad to see 
 That I'm not here anymore 
 I'm poetic while they pathetic 
 I play they life like a movie and in the end give 'em no credit 
 I was told to run it, so I grip the baton 
 And spit magic like it's pouring out the tip of a wand 
 Don't trip, you ain't equipped to fix ya lip and respond 
 I plan to X you out like the man who hand you and script the Quran 
 Since life flipped, I'm getting chips in Milan 
 Pull dips, push whips like the one from the clips in the Tron film 
 I blow your mental mass where your mind stem 
 Like a nine M-M right at your line trim 
 You must rewind him, the syllable sensei 
 Then bring ya to ya knees the way biblical men pray 
 Or whores in a brothel 
 'Cause I spill ill from the grill 
 Like one who reveals sores from their mouth hole 
 And if you only knew the shit that I been through 
 To pain the type of pictures my pen drew 
 Your label tries to fuck you, your friends screw you over 
 Now you sober watching bad energy affect the evils that men do 
 They fucking see through 
 I'mma sick flower that carry lines 
 Like when you click over on you dick blowers 
 And it sucks to be you 
 Right where I thought I'd be 
 It's another part of me 
 And the world's so sad to see 
 That I'm not here anymore
