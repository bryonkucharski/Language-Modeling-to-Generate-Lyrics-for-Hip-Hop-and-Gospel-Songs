We met up at the mall in the fall, somethin' I'll never forget 
 She was the shit like when you sit and let it fall in the stall 
 Like it was made, I'm more taller then small, she was 5'3" 
 Looking like a women with drive that had the live key 
 I pressed up loving her thighs and how she dressed up 
 Buggin' off her eyes and the size of her breast cups 
 Long story short, I got the numbers and the email 
 We talked about the past and she broke it down in detail 
 How it felt to not have a father as a female 
 Told me that was confidential keep that on the DL 
 Her convo was classic as Illmatic in 9-4 
 After that day since then I let our bond grow 
 That was like three years strong, it wasn't long 
 Before I strip the thong gave her the schlong and wrote this song 
 And it reads "Baby girl is everything I need" 
 Rollin' my weed that's why I fuck even when she bleed 
 Ya don't feel me but shorty even taught me how to slim down 
 Bailed me out of jail, got my car out the impound 
 Cooked me hot meals, helped me when I got bills 
 Keeps me buzzed and does all of the above, one what? One love 
 Her childhood was rough, her father's out robbin' for stuff 
 It never was enough, soon he was cuffed and later snuffed 
 She explains how she felt and how the cards were dealt 
 I can tell she was scarred, life was hard, no help 
 She was raised off of Dexter 
 Where the pimps and prostitution a little extra men wanted to sex her 
 Back when she was six she recalls porno flicks 
 Mother turning tricks and dicks just to get a fix 
 And though they got by, she can't remember a day 
 When her mother was not high, chasin' some hot guy 
 Fast forward to middle school she's fucking with a baller 
 On Pirelli's, he bought her a celly so he can call her 
 She moved out at sixteen to live with this older guy 
 He was twenty-five, that nigga use to blow her high 
 Had a few exes one named was Robbie 
 Was pushing a new Lexus by owning some duplexes 
 Only thing he was too sexist 
 Baby girl was getting beat downs, body slams and suplexes 
 Was happy that she left cause that coulda been death 
 He did a little more then push and shove, one love 
 She had very bad taste in men 
 Her last boyfriend who was chasing ends is facing ten 
 I know just why he stuck with her, he knew she was a down chick 
 Never do she lie and never does she sound slick 
 Told me she was tired of them dudes and I was different 
 How I don't just lay around all day and get lifted 
 And she can see the future, I took her to museums 
 And taught her some Kamma Sutra, next level 
 Way beyond my ex level, right down to the sex 
 Feeling like it's no latex, she gives me breakfast in bed 
 After that then it's excellent head 
 I got her open like a wound where the affection can spread 
 I can't lie I feel the same, I thought I was a player 
 Till I seen her kill the game the day she revealed her name 
 Can't another chick scoop me in a room full of groupies 
 She's the only one that I be thinking of... one love
