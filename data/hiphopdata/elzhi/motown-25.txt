(Verse 1: Elzhi) 
 I end careers, years, pierce ears fierce with spears 
 They say I'm gifted, get lifted like the beers in Cheers 
 Catch a thunder bolt, pockets stay lump from hundred notes 
 Stunning quotes make you run your coat while the sun's afloat 
 Prehaps, my skill is real as G Rap's 
 It feel as ill as concealing drills in the knee caps 
 Your funny style get three snaps in the circle when off 
 The purple and greens, I'm higher than the jeans on Erkel, then I murk you 
 Bust tecs, the lead sparking now who be my next head target 
 I lift up, roll out, like the red carpet 
 Say my name three times in the mirror and if I hear you 
 I'll appear clearer, extend both arms and pull you nearer 
 Pound for pound, I'm pretty live on the mic 
 And keep it flooded like Mike, on Motown 25 
 Put your soul on ice and sold it for a whole known price 
 I'm nice, keep a knot swole on dice 
 Grin is sarcastic, the way my pen'll spark acid on the bar 
 Whether in the crib or the car, blast it 
 Son is a, prob rob funds from your publisher 
 While his dogs put his guns to you like the Punisher 
 Or the Terminator, flow is harder 
 Than a German major midterm paper, the kid burns the saber 
 Striking cats, how you want it, gats, spike or bats 
 I know you liking that, I stay sharper than Viking hats 
 Exhale, blowed mist, served you with a cold dish 
 Niggas vomiting, bowels moving, they can't hold piss 
 El and Royce, double team, hotter than a cup of steam 
 Club your spleen and bury you, just as deep as a submarine 
 Flawless, should be that very reason you applaud us 
 You saw us laying down a law just as raw as a crawfish 
 You met your death and although, I took away your breath 
 And I ran, I still left with a Grand like Theft Auto 
 (Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9") 
 You little niggas can't touch me, baby 
 Okay, maybe Jay Z or maybe not 
 Pardon if I sound lazy, I've been puffing crazy 
 Writing Puff's shit, so mothafucka fuck you, pay me 
 Or lay down in your feces, my guns talk, I'm speechless 
 My Pen's that Teller, I bends that fella, now peep this 
 I eat you and then wash you down with who you eat with 
 Me and Elzhi, yeah, we split 
 He's sick, I'm sick, I'm sick of how sick 
 He is, he's sick of how sick me, is me, baby me 
 Sickest in the D, since the Shady LP 
 I can fuck, that's what ladies tell me 
 '83 I was fucking, I was six, head in my momma's daycare 
 Yeah, that was nothing, I'm the shit 
 Back into my rhyme again, niggas call me arrogant 
 That's because I'm confident, I found it when I found a pen 
 Three deals later, three meals later, tryna win 
 About to be signed again, that's right I'm bout to clown again 
 Knock-knock, who is that? It's the cat that'll snap 
 Throw cheese in the trap, on you homie, you a rat 
 Ha-ha-ha, I'm back, matter of fact I've never left 
 Those who say they ain't expect it, can't accept it 
 Haters left this, boy no choice but to blow 
 Fuck another ho from on another pole, fuck a show 
 Fuck a flow, I'm about getting money fast 
 While you rapping or perhaps you hustling sucka slow 
 Ice glow, sticky green, bush on sicky team 
 Capone, put powerful "White Boy Ricky" cream 
 Get him straight if he leans, fifty fiends in a line 
 Nickel Nine, been around, niggas you would kneel around 
 From Milan to Iran, I'm a don 
 Now when I'm around niggas calming down eating like it's Ramadan
