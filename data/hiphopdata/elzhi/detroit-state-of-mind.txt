It's Elmatic 
 Yeah, I'mma start this shit off, man 
 Yo, rappers I monkey-flip 'em, gorilla-stomp 'em 
 I'm out here with the dealers pumpin', the killers dumpin' 
 Dead bodies in Lake Michigan that shake fishermen 
 Pimps turn into pastors, the fake bishops in the churches 
 And props determined off what you purchase 
 Or who you murked just a week ago, dug up from searches 
 And police raids, decreased grades; someone deceased made 
 The front page, the priests prayed he went to heaven, but the beast stayed 
 Now it's a war, and flowers for more funerals 
 You see who's soon to go a few hours before 
 It's just the same story, they cutting more ki's 
 When someone OD's in the same building on the same story 
 - It's that ruthless. Drug addicts is toothless, turned doofus 
 Responsible for how the wasted youth is 
 Who run up in your shop and steal, popping pills 
 At the house party with a hoodrat copping feels 
 Fuckin' raw, mentality's like 
 Fuck the law, nowadays niggas buck when they woulda snuffed ya jaw 
 In the city of schemes where money is power 
 And shots go off at the funniest hour 
 Now its breaking news, it's best that you stay awake than snooze 
 They taking lives or they taking shoes 
 I jot it down like I'm Langston Hughes 
 And paint a picture in my good book that's full of verses 
 That ain't a scripture nor from the religion 
 Judges put men under the prison 
 Them shorties screamin' they riders, but ain't none of 'em driven 
 I try to school 'em 'cause they dropped out, once they popped out the pussy 
 They mad because they pussy pops out, now they a bastard 
 Life can be fatal and a hazard, from the cradle to the casket 
 I'm rightfully raised around a life of crime, snitches dropping dimes 
 I think of rhymes when I'm in a Detroit State of Mind 
 *Scratches* 
 Detroit State of Mind 
 Detroit State of Mind 
 Detroit State of Mind 
 Detroit State of Mind 
 (Verse 2:Elzhi) 
 Be having dreams that I'm a gangsta, sipping on bottles of Rozay 
 Chilling with my out-of-town connect named Jose 
 Tryna hustle for more pay, police in my doorway 
 I never have my head in the clouds 'cause they could go gray 
 And that ain't my forte, so fuck a job 
 Or who I stuck and robbed just the other day 
 Who's listening to what they mother say about finishing school 
 To get they GED, while crackheads is tryna sling an HDTV 
 For rocks to snort? The fast life is why the time on ya clocks is short 
 Even the shorties pulling Glocks from they boxer shorts 
 Rap sheet be so long that it shocks the courts 
 It's why we called the Murder City, tip a stripper then you can purr the kitty 
 Bad Boys before we heard of Diddy 
 Word, to Maserati Rick, Demetrius Holloway 
 And those who celebrate by busting guns on a Holiday 
 Happy to see another year end and begin 
 Was told to watch for enemies that pretend to be friends 
 They hit you with the setup, I seen it all with my own two 
 The hood is like a glass house the Devil throws stones through 
 Many are stressed off the Henny or sess 
 Maybe because the city is built above where Indians rest 
 In peace, police found deceased, it's hair-raising like Kelis 
 D-boys high and workin' they fleece, and bubble geese 
 I knew this fly chick, pretty right, she was my type - that crack shit 
 Wasn't hype, she fell in love with the pipe 
 She had dreams, of being the next D. Ross of the Supremes 
 Overdosed in the lot, between the plot and the schemes
