We have to understand that we're talking about our survival and nothing else 
 Whether or not this beautiful race of people is going to survive on the Earth 
 That's what we are talking about, nothing else 
 (Verse 1: Fes Roc) 
 Shots bust in, cops rush in, on niggas hustling 
 You know the science of money is substance, the evils 
 My peoples, live illegal, stack dough that equals 
 To large amounts, that's hard to count 
 I blow an ounce and watch the plot thicken 
 We on the block pitching, while the cops watch with optic vision 
 Listen, my hood is chaos, it never sleeps 
 Crime's got us knee deep in the streets, uh, between the sheets 
 I write verses, while the Devil curses 
 Watching young kingpins get put in hearses, the fiends lurking 
 For the dream merchant, their last days seems certain 
 He overdose before they close the curtain 
 Tryna tackle the grind, stress hard on my soul 
 And shackle my mind, making my heart cold 
 And my head hot, cause's bread not, coming in and I'm 
 Losing my cool, like the summer wind strolling through 
 My goal is to stand on the bottom of my feet again 
 Even if it means robbing then I got 'em in the street in 
 Broad day and no this ain't of God's way, so I'm hoping 
 If opportunity knocked, then mine locked, doors open 
 I'm living fast, but cash is moving slow in motion 
 I'm going through ups and downs like I'm roller coasting 
 Riding, hiding feelings behind a wide grin 
 I almost died inside when I couldn't provide ends 
 Meet, wish I could say life's been sweet 
 In street drama, the thermometer blends heat 
 Heat, I'm tryna find a way, depression is grew high 
 I search for a blue sky, but I'm seein signs of gray 
 I got a line I say, if I come with two 
 And combine a trey, add a fourth 
 I watch how these words on a pad'll morph into a rhyme 
 This might get me out the sewer grime, many get stuck, few'll climb 
 They pursue a crime because my city's so poor 
 My nigga Jay got killed robbing this video store 
 Tryna provide for his seed, seed 
 He felt his world caving in, before the day that he bleed 
 And indeed, greed will fuck your mind if you give it brain 
 Or give it head, that's one the same 
 As long as blood's running through my hundred veins 
 It'll come together whether the weather is sun or rain 
 It's been another murder, where it never shine, shine 
 Hustlers off in these streets, again like fine wine 
 Ever the lost souls at the age of nine, grind 
 Grew eyes in the back of my head for who behind mine 
 That backstab, smack dab in your stacked abs 
 Till it black scab, feel the pressure like cracked crab 
 They say the streets is watching 
 When clicks meet they leave you six feet inboxed in 
 The block's been good to the hood, got hella bad 
 Some young fellas that caught slippin, can tell he sad 
 Fuck it, that's how it go, you just got to keep your eyes peeled 
 Heard about some guys killed inside my old junior high's field 
 They said a crackhead did it for white powder 
 He fiending and so he left 'em leaning, I seen 'em 
 To just a day ago, that's the way it go 
 Where they ain't paying dough, so get to laying low 
 Man, make you want to do somethin' crazy man 
 Get on that 2Pac, Juice tip, get to robbing a liquor store or something
