Yo it's Elmatic, shouts out to the homie Nas, son 
 Words from the wise one, make both your eyes run 
 Red with blood like Gogo Yubari 
 You barely throw jabs with your vo-cab-u-lary 
 My punchlines knock niggas the fuck out 
 Still earn block figures, cop triggers and duck droughts 
 The flyest, and I ain't just being biased 
 In Hebrew Elzhi is one with the Messiah 
 You just a virus, a fucking disease that 
 Infects geese your techniques ain't nothing to sneeze at 
 I'm much sicker, I crack the seal on a dutch sticker 
 Split the blunt, roll it back up and lit the front 
 Then wrote a classic, to bury you below the casket 
 Picture that like it's photographic 
 Fuck your chain with your logo crafted, you just a follower 
 Your mother shouldn't of had your ass, she should have swallowed ya 
 Like bottles of pills to overdose 
 Only to leave you comatose to wake up as one of Jehovah's ghosts 
 I been mean since the age 16 
 From long range could rearrange if we exchange 16's 
 As far as spittin' bars I'm on the level with the stars 
 Devil tryna tempt me with the bezels and the cars 
 But I'm too swift with the true gift 
 I knew if I put a line down you'd sniff 
 Blew spliffs in the park, guns spark 
 Niggas running from the narcs and animals that bark 
 It's more crazy than a picture by Martin Scorsese 
 Instead of y'all starting wars, praise me, fuck y'all
