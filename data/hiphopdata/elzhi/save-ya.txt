Picture me going out, I know what a ho about 
 Tryna glow off the next man's dough account 
 But I've, been swift on the toes, since an infant 
 Why should I treat you different with a gift and a rose? 
 That's the way I could please ya, but you a hood skeezer 
 I should squeeze ya, for smoking up my good reefer 
 You see me hopping out of limousines 
 So you begin to scheme on my winning team, but in your dreams 
 You got them niggas actin' strange going crazy 
 Cause you got a figure that could change "no" to "maybe" 
 Infatuated with material things 
 You only see your feet in them shoes, your ears in those rings 
 But ah, you could come around on your best behavior 
 But sorry love I can't save ya... 
 And I know every nigga on the block gon' praise ya 
 I'm international, I can't save ya 
 And there's only one thing I know 
 You really gotta go for sure, ayo 
 So baby girl on no grounds, will we marry, slow down 
 So just hold your horses like a merry go round, round 
 You fantasizing 'bout shopping sprees 
 Cause you seen me dropping G's, like I'm chopping keys 
 Calling your best friend and tell her that I'm balling 
 And how you go and have me all in love falling 
 Fed you a meal, now you head over heels 
 Dead it and chill, you would have got in bed for a bill 
 But still, you can't explain why you feeling me this past year 
 Which one will it be you liability or asset 
 Let me take a guess, you would show your naked flesh 
 And shake your breast at any man that would make some sess 
 But don't come around me for a favor 
 Sorry sweetheart, I can't save ya... 
 And we can roll out, roll up, smoke herb of different flavors 
 I can get ya high but can't save ya 
 Primetiming's in her mind 
 But she said me for this time 
 So now, me and you we could never be an item 
 You goin' nowhere, look how far I've come 
 I got my own shit, but you don't own shit 
 You bone for a Sprint phone and your home rent 
 You might have played other niggas but they not me 
 They see with two eyes, you know I got three 
 (Verse 4: T3) 
 You can't play me, no not three 
 Uh-uh, I'm not the one, that's why I got free 
 You can't save the unsaveable 
 Ms. Unsatiable, you coming at me like a Flavor Roast 
 You want it your way or the highway 
 You raise your voice, but settle down this where I stay 
 You never cease to surprise me 
 So I had to go like a worker on a Friday 
 You know what you did, don't try to look me sideways 
 A little thing called trust, glowin' my phone up 
 All in my contacts callin peeps up 
 So time's up, I done been through enough 
 The road too rocky for me to roll so I bust up 
 (Hook] + [Bridge) 
 I could send you my French ride 
 Was it to have a good time?
