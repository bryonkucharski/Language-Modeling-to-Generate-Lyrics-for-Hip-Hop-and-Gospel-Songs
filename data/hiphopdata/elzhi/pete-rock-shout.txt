(Intro: Elzhi) 
 Yeah 
 This goes out to everybody that's trying to get on 
 Think they gonna get rich 
 Take notes, yo 
 (Verse 1: Elzhi) 
 Through the lights, camera and action 
 Glamour, glitters and gold 
 Here's a warning to anybody that considers this road 
 Of riches, filled with jewelry, cars, and thirsty bitches 
 Crooked contracts, the close friends who switches 
 Up on you when things go sour 
 Around y'all 
 It's called a downfall cause it brings more showers 
 But don't forget the rain in the spring grows flowers 
 That causes you to rise where a king shows power 
 And it's not easy 
 You got a measly one shot 
 To be hot up in the game 
 But over time it got sleazy 
 Major labels wanna judge you off your last record 
 Then design something you can sign, to fuck your ass naked 
 That can turn your 15 minutes into last seconds 
 Take it from somebody with a past checkered as mine 
 I was in a group around '99 
 But rappin' since eight, thought it was great 
 To be finally signed 
 But little did I know I made a huge mistake 
 I found out the label and the manager was fake 
 And the person that betrayed me the most was my partner 
 Though all three would be the reason for my departure 
 I'm thinking to myself 
 "How you let them out smart ya?" 
 Nobody warned me like I'm warning you 
 Happy, aren't ya? 
 But I'mma show'em 
 That it was nice to know'em 
 Or maybe I should ho 'em 
 And throw them in the poem 
 'Cause they think that I'm below them 
 Just wait until my shit drop 
 'Cause I got a drive that don't slow down for pit stops 
 And this one goes to my aspiring artists 
 With the fire in their eyes 
 To reach higher and farthest in the skies 
 May every move you make be wise 
 And may every mistake 
 You can take and reprise 
 You only get one shot 
 It's not like you get three tries 
 To rise like G5s 
 And I'm out... 
 (Outro: Elzhi) 
 Yeah 
 This is how it goes, yo 
 Read between the lines 
 Make sure your paperwork's straight, get your attorneys 
 You don't wanna be like me yo 
 Sign a bullshit contract 
 Fuck that 
 Get your own 
 For all my aspiring artists out there
