When I rap, I make trees collapse 
 Shake the street like a tank perhaps 
 When I sing, I clear cloudy skies 
 Reveal the truth among a million lies 
 When I spit, I make ugly hot 
 Slot machines stop and hit jackpot 
 When I rhyme, I like the dark 
 Hungry passion from the heart 
 When I rap, the freak show appears 
 Do in three seconds what takes two years 
 When I sing, you can feel the wind 
 We in three d and time can bend 
 When I spit, it's like power on 
 Total staleness becomes the bomb 
 When I rhyme, the sun shines over 
 And the moon appears that much closer 
 When I rap, I defy impossible 
 Leap right over it like every obstacle 
 When I sing, volcanoes erupt 
 I turn twenty cents into fifty bucks 
 When I spit, we reach high elevation 
 Your head receives mass education 
 When I rhyme, everybody can fly 
 Goals get reached on they very first try 
 When I rap, the carnivals in town 
 Four leaf clovers all over the ground 
 When I sing, the hat can sing 
 Toys come alive and it ain't pretend 
 When I spit, I spin the planet faster 
 We skip tragedies and dodge disaster 
 When I rhyme, shooting stars collide 
 Colorful explosions all in the sky 
 When I rap, I become attractive 
 Melt the mic down, I'm radioactive 
 When I sing, hotties drop they thongs 
 They all want to fuck to they favorite songs 
 When I spit, I'm the candy man 
 Turn any ghetto into candy land 
 When I rhyme, I bring rain to flames 
 Break down walls and chew through chains
