This is for all the Juggalos enjoyin these days with us in Shangri-Lees ass 
 Poof of smoke and we're there hella tight 
 Like Hallowicked 2002 second night 
 Let me tell these fucks about 8 Mile road 
 And how we run this bitch, let the truth be told 
 Black truck convoys stretching East to West 
 With little hatchetmen in back windows upper left 
 This juggalo nation, can't nothin' compete 
 'Cause we run under with the dirt flip side of the street 
 Ever since the first time I seen the diamond rain 
 I'm lovin' every second that it shine the same 
 So many wanna see us bring the fire rain 
 Why can't we just enjoy it, while the time remains? 
 I in a crystal forest under a green lit sky 
 Tornadoes of glitter float calmly by 
 Angels fly naked letting they titties swing 
 And so many fucking diamonds, you can ice errrrthing 
 Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine 
 Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine 
 Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine 
 You ain't stoppin' mine, it's so fine 
 Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine 
 Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine 
 Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine 
 You ain't stoppin' mine, you ain't stoppin' mine 
 Rap Game, it's happenin', I'm stepping in 
 I represent the hatchetman, the best I can 
 You can not hold be back 
 Just like The Wraith I walk through you 
 I Kung-Fu like guru and Southwest Voodoo 
 It's Joe Bruce baby, legendary relax 
 I see running down hallways now looking for cracks 
 Every morning when I'm wake up and no halo on my shit 
 I got a body on my bathroom floor 
 So I cut it and I chop it and I wrap and I drop it 
 I take a shower and I'm ready for more 
 I get wicked like AIDS in a gay man's butt 
 I spit lyrics so cold my mouths frozen shut 
 Rap Game, it's happening, I'm stepping in 
 I represent the hatchetman, as best I can 
 Ruby red trees, yellow gem bushes 
 Mercury waterfalls, granting all wishes 
 Neon clouds, look in the myst you'll find 
 My axe in the back of the fool trying to stop my shine 
 Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine 
 Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine 
 Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine 
 You ain't stoppin' mine, it's so fine 
 Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine 
 Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine 
 Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine 
 You ain't stoppin' mine, you ain't stoppin' mine 
 Rap Game, it's happenin', I'm steppin' in 
 I represent the hatchetman, as best I can (Truth is) 
 I never been to any Churches, cept for some chicken 
 I don't trust no one, I tell a priest eat a dick, and 
 Then spit some old school Esham on his ass 
 I even used Bible papers when I've twisted my grass 
 But the Carnival has always been around with us blessing 
 It ain't never tried to feel up my balls at confession 
 We know the Carnival is God. That's odd? So what. It is 
 And we ain't sorry if we tricked you Bitch!" 
 Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine (YES! THINK WE GIVE A FUCK? WHAT?) 
 Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine 
 Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine 
 You ain't stoppin' mine, it's so fine 
 Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine (THE FUCK?) 
 Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine 
 Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine (WHAT?) 
 You ain't stoppin' mine, you ain't stoppin' mine 
 Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine 
 Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine 
 Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine 
 You ain't stoppin' mine, it's so fine 
 Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine 
 Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine 
 Ain't nobody gonna stop my shine 
 You ain't stoppin' mine, you ain't stoppin' mine 
 Rap Game, it's happenin', I'm steppin' in 
 I represent the hatchetman, as best I can
