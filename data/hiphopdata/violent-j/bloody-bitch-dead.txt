I live life like I'm playing a game of X-box 
 I don't give a fuck if I die or get caught 
 There I am, god-damn, everything was smooth 
 I woke up with a bloody bitch dead in the bathroom 
 My wicked shit praise that I heard through the days 
 Somehow now relays my new murderous ways 
 Violent J's not around but Moon Glorious is there 
 Scared of fucking death, and what's happening here 
 Blood in the tub as I scrub a dub, on my knees geez 
 I hope she ain't have a disease 
 I need the keys to the shed, I'ma cut the head off 
 My daddy got a knife in there to cut lead off 
 How should I do this, what sounds fun? 
 I just sat on her headpiece and twiddled my thumbs 
 Finally said fuck it, stomped her face 
 Sunk in like a pumpkin, I left no trace 
 Another bitch dead (On my bathroom floor) 
 Another bitch dead (on my bathroom floor) 
 Another bitch dead (In my bathroom) 
 Find me, deep in the night I be thugging 
 Another bitch dead (On my bathroom floor) 
 Another bitch dead (On my bathroom floor) 
 Another bitch dead (In my bathroom) 
 Find me, end of the night I be scrubbing 
 You must think I'm some kind of fucking idiot, don't ya? 
 What you think I'ma do, warn you when I'm on ya? 
 That's what TV do, with forensic files 
 Teaching all your secrets and styles 
 Got that (?) for your crime lab 
 You'll find nothing but a carcass slab 
 I got forty dead bodies all buried out back 
 And if a limb's sticking out when I'm mowing I handle that 
 This bitch don't, she deserve this 
 She had a neden that wouldn't provide service 
 She even stuck a stiletto in my eye 
 Three inches deep and I still couldn't see why 
 I had to stab her with a toothbrush in the throat 
 And then stuff the bitch mouth with a bar of soap 
 Drown the bitch in a toilet at that 
 Look at them tiles, she dead on crack 
 Another bitch dead (On my bathroom floor) 
 Another bitch dead (on my bathroom floor) 
 Another bitch dead (In my bathroom) 
 Find me, deep in the night I be thugging 
 Another bitch dead (On my bathroom floor) 
 Another bitch dead (On my bathroom floor) 
 Another bitch dead (In my bathroom) 
 Find me, end of the night I be scrubbing 
 Four o' clock in the morning out here and one slip up 
 Had to freeze her so the bitch ain't a dripper 
 Unzip the zipper, feel like Jack the Ripper 
 Had to monkey flip her in a wood chipper 
 Blood on my walls, mirrors and floors 
 Some even on the carpet from under the doors 
 I never saw so much fucking blood before 
 A slutty whore with more blood than a dinosaur 
 Ajax is a (?), call Mr. Clean 
 Tell him and Comet they're needed at the scene 
 Scrubbed all night to some old color me bad 
 Wrapped up the bloody towels in a garbage bag 
 Send it to the curb, it ain't absurd 
 This week's been good, that bitch was the third 
 Hell's Pit's gots a cactus waiting on my ass 
 So expect me to cry when its time to pass 
 Another bitch dead (On my bathroom floor) 
 Another bitch dead (on my bathroom floor) 
 Another bitch dead (In my bathroom) 
 Find me, deep in the night I be thugging 
 Another bitch dead (On my bathroom floor) 
 Another bitch dead (On my bathroom floor) 
 Another bitch dead (In my bathroom) 
 Find me, end of the night I be scrubbing
