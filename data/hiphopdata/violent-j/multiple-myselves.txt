Violent J: 
 As I lay the silence is deafening 
 The quiet is volume 10, it's happening again 
 How do I stop my brain from shaking me up? 
 Larry: 
 Oh, why you waking me up? 
 I'm Larry, I'm J's fear 
 I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be here 
 I hope I don't get in trouble for rapping 
 And I hope that girl don't get pregnant we're tapping 
 Violent J: 
 Would you mind getting out of my head when I rap? 
 Larry: 
 But what if our records are whack? 
 And what if I flop, man I don't know shit 
 Violent J: 
 Larry you worry about to much bullshit 
 Thanks for your rap though 
 Larry: 
 Was it ok? 
 Violent J: 
 Yeah, but when I rhyme they wanna hear Violent J 
 'Cause I deliver the swift axe chops 
 Plush: 
 Ummm, can we stop? 
 Hello, I'm J's soft side 
 He never shows affection and makes me hide 
 My name is Plush and I'm barely used at all 
 Violent J: 
 FUUCCKK!, what-what's happening y'all? 
 I have no control of me 
 Mood or personality 
 Chemical Imbalances 
 They control me randomly 
 Captivity: 
 What up playa? The name's Captivity 
 I'm J's chick boning ability 
 Being that we ugly it ain't a piece of cake 
 But we get our fair shake 
 Violent J: 
 Mmmm, somebody help me I'm falling apart 
 Personalities are pouring out of my heart 
 Just pay me no mind, I forgot my pill today 
 Larry: 
 Are you sure we're ok? 
 Captivity: 
 Look here motherfucker, get it right 
 Or, we gonna be a virgin the rest of our life? 
 Violent J: 
 Why you telling them shit? Go fuck yourself 
 Plush: 
 Hey buddy, he's only trying to help 
 I should be mad, you never go my way 
 Violent J: 
 That's 'cause you're a fuckin' pussy ass, and I'm Violent J 
 But I'm not going crazy, I'm just being funny 
 Yeah right 
 Help Somebody 
 I have no control of me 
 Mood or personality 
 Chemical Imbalances 
 They control me randomly 
 Violent J: 
 Juggalos I'm sorry, I'm out of control 
 I got personality issues fo sho 
 All I ever wanted you to hear was Violent J 
 Fred: 
 Well excuse me then, I'll get out of your way 
 Violent J: 
 Wait I'm sorry Fred, Tell them about you 
 Fred: 
 Well I handle the smarts for our Mr. Bruce 
 I once read a book, I have a ninth grade degree 
 And who we kidding you don't even use me 
 Violent J: 
 Relax already, don't get pissed 
 You know who's probably here in the mist 
 All we need is Butch showing up here 
 Butch: 
 Too late pussy, throw me a beer 
 The name is Butch I'm J's anger, and well 
 Get me pissed we going to jail 
 Violent J: 
 Take it easy man, here have some NyQuil 
 Leave the beat downs to Billy Bill 
 I have no control of me 
 Mood or personality 
 Chemical Imbalances 
 They control me randomly 
 I have no control of me 
 Mood or personality 
 Chemical Imbalances 
 They control me randomly 
 Stop Them
