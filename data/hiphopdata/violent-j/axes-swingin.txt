10) Axes Swingin' 
 Ever since Picker Forest started 
 I been hatchetly retarded 
 All laws been disregarded 
 I just wanna see souls departed 
 I throw round kicks like Joe Kasugi 
 I leave necks all broken and loopy 
 And your fucking hoes a groupy 
 So I got every reason for a neck squeezing 
 I call upon the dead 
 To rise up and jump on your head 
 Wicked shit cause blood to shed 
 I ride a voodoo train right through your brain 
 I'm like a demon statue 
 I'm sick when singing at you 
 And bitch I leap I catch you 
 It's just I'm wicked, dick it, can we still kick it? 
 Chop chop 
 We love to 
 Chop chop 
 We need to 
 Chop chop 
 Forever 
 Painted faces, axes swinging 
 Clinical depression 
 Try to end it with Smith and Wesson 
 You might have noticed my mouth is missing 
 Blew it off into non-existion 
 Didn't know that I was already dead 
 Vampire blood already spread 
 Being alive is all in the head 
 Like Jamie and Paul already said 
 It will all be explained in the Green Book 
 You inside of my Salem's Lot 
 And in Hells Pit flames is hot 
 And all them icy chains you got 
 And lynch you brought 
 Can't change your spot 
 You dug your plot 
 I can't wait to die 
 That's why I never hate to fly 
 I got a Holy Water icicle for Satan's eye 
 And I know the Wraith's waiting by 
 Ok let's fly 
 Chop chop 
 We love to 
 Chop chop 
 We need to 
 Chop chop 
 Forever 
 Painted faces, axes swinging
