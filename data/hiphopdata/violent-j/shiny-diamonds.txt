(The Lion) 
 I mean what do you got going on there that's so good? 
 (Violent J) 
 Man, it ain't always all good at home 
 But the few days it is makes it all worth while. 
 It's all about time and chance it's gotta be 
 You got trailer park moms winning powerball lottery 
 And if a little girl gets stuck in a well 
 You got the whole world feeling the Hell 
 And trying to help, 
 We got good intentions, maybe bad ideas 
 Like fucking fine nedens laced with ghonerea 
 But the adventure is real and ain't nobody alone 
 Especially me, so come the fuck on, let's get home 
 I got bitches to fuck we being rich as 
 Truck at the Mexican festival hitting switches 
 The bed be elevating, no hating 
 Only congratulating, and the hoes steady tailgating 
 With their neden holes waiting 
 On daytons, man that truck was so tight, 
 That's why I'm trying to go back sometimes it be all right 
 And the rest of the bullshit, I can walk right through 
 I'm tryna see a wheel chair, 
 A hot nurse, at a 100 and 2 years old 
 And the tree 
 (Scarecrow, Tin Man, Lion) 
 And the herb 
 And the smoke 
 And the ganj 
 (Violent J) 
 The tree is all right 
 It ain't much going on but that's where I belong 
 Because some of them days be shiny diamonds, (sometimes) 
 And it can't be wrong, 
 Because some of them nights the moon be shining, (sometimes) 
 Like a world of gold, so much unexplored 
 And I be climbing, homies rhyming, heaven 
 I'm in, people can do they thing 
 And mine is singing, (singing) I'm singing... 
 Like Michael Jackson y'all 
 I said I'm singing, (singing) I'm singing... 
 Without the little boys and the plastic nose... 
 (Violent J) 
 We kick the wicked shit in packed ass clubs 
 We scrubs, your everyday Joe's, Mike's, and Tom Dub's 
 But that's are thing and we love that shit 
 And people sick, thinking wicked shit gone quit 
 Tell me why do stress be, L-I-F-E 
 Everyday's a new adventure for the fella's with me 
 We only got so long I'm tryna get out and see 
 I'm tryna get out and be, who tryna do it like me 
 You might see from above, you might fall in love, 
 You might get your dick sucked from the back like what 
 You might discover your nitch, and look you ain't a bitch 
 All this just days after you was gone quit 
 I ain't on some mother you whack motherfucker 
 This shit for juggalos, we talking to each other 
 Not them other hoes, we shudder those hoes to back rows 
 And crack those Faygo's and the place explodes 
 And the cush 
 (Scarecrow, Tin Man, Lion) 
 And the green 
 And the sass 
 And the dro 
 (Violent J) 
 The cush is all right, 
 It ain't much going on but that's where I belong 
 Because some of them days be shiny diamonds, (sometimes) 
 And it can't be wrong, 
 Because some of them nights the moon be shining, (sometimes) 
 Like a world of gold, so much unexplored 
 And I be climbing, homies rhyming, heaven 
 I'm in, people can do they thing 
 And mine is singing, (singing) I'm singing... 
 Like Eddie Vedder only better... 
 I said I'm singing, (singing) I'm fucking singing... 
 And making cheddar somehow and smoking shredder somehow, wow. 
 It ain't much going on but that's where I belong 
 Because some of them days be shiny diamonds, (sometimes) 
 And it can't be wrong, 
 Because some of them nights the moon be shining, (sometimes) 
 Like a world of gold, so much unexplored 
 And I be climbing, homies rhyming, heaven 
 I'm in, people can do they thing 
 And mine is singing, (singing) I'm singing... 
 Like Axl Rose and them, when he was with Slash and them... 
 I said I'm singing, I'm (singing)... 
 I'm fucking singing, fucking singing, I'm fucking singing... 
 (Scarecrow, Tin Man, Lion) 
 Well let's get you home then!
