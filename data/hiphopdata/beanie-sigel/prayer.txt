As I wake up in the mornin', stretch my arms wide 
 Before I even yawn or wipe the cold out my eyes 
 I say Al Humdulillah, givin' praise to my God 
 Allowin' me another day, blessin' me to rise 
 Know at any given moment, it could be my demise 
 'Cause you only get a minute to pray 
 (And a second to die) 
 And realizing that I've come to terms with that 
 One day I'm gon' burn for all my heinous acts 
 I know a sincere prayer can only change my fate 
 So I drop, prostrate and pray it ain't too late 
 For me to ask for forgiveness and increase my faith 
 And guide me on the path that's straight 
 And never lead me astray 
 'Cause I know I can't walk this alone 
 I'm in fear of that fork in the road 
 The devil there, waitin' to claim my soul 
 So I pray that You, hold my hand 
 As I follow your footprints in the sand 
 Now I know I done did some wrong 
 And I ain't been to talk to you in so, so long 
 So I'ma hit my knees and extend my palms 
 And send this up to you and hope you hear this 
 I'll be prayin' 
 (Prayin') 
 I'll be prayin' 
 (Prayin') 
 I'll be prayin' 
 (Yeah) 
 I'll be prayin' 
 (Ayee yeah) 
 I often find myself stuck, just starin' in space 
 Feel like hours at a time, my mind driftin' away 
 Can't quite collect my thoughts or put 'em in place 
 And I grab a glimpse of my momma with a head full of grays 
 I know they shouldn' be there 
 (Nah) 
 Not for her age 
 And then I think of how I stressed her and shortened her days 
 Her long sleepless nights, not knowing if I was safe 
 Or was my name on the list of the reaper that day 
 I sink deeper as I feel a tear creep down my face 
 I wipe it away, now my thoughts on life in the grave 
 I know on that day that three things gon' go wit ya 
 Ya family, ya wealth and ya deeds but two gon' leave 
 And when that last person leave that site 
 The grave gon' squeeze so tight 
 Ya ribs gon' overlap till every bone crack 
 I drop my head in despair, imagine going through that 
 I smell fire then I notice the hole in my pants 
 I drop my cigarette butt and brush off my ash 
 I'm still stuck but I notice a car pass 
 I hear the driver cussin' me out over his horn blast 
 Damn, this can't be right, let me snap back to life 
 How long I been stuck, day dreaming at this light? 
 Wondering if that's a sign of how I'm moving through life 
 A reckless abandon, a accident, just waitin' to happen 
 Now I know I done did some wrong 
 And I ain't been to talk to you in so, so long 
 So I'ma hit my knees and extend my palms 
 And send this up to you and hope you hear this 
 I'll be prayin' 
 (Prayin') 
 I'll be prayin' 
 (Prayin') 
 I'll be prayin' 
 (Yeah) 
 I'll be prayin' 
 (Ayee yeah)
