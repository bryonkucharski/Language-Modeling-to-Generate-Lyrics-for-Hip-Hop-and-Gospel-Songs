 (Incomprehensible) 
 For the dynasty, a million 
 (Incomprehensible) 
 Check it out, yo 
 Aiyo, this time it's for my family, we ride or die 
 It's in the blood till the death, now aim for the sky 
 My four blow fo show, fo doe, for only 
 It's money, drugs and hot slugs you know bleek 
 Squeeze hammers t'il they nail me, fuck what niggas tell me 
 Street scholar, keep firin' is what they tell me 
 Drug chemist, thug nigga be named Memphis 
 Straight from da borough of dem B.K. niggas 
 Where we rob for the fun of it, hustle for the drug of it 
 Rap money in rubber-bands, just for the love of it 
 Straight from my ghetto, we listen to heavy metal like 
 Desert eagles, street sweepers, loud metal 
 It's hit an run now, motherfuck anyone of you 
 We dem niggas be in ya crib just like furniture 
 Pop up with the gun in ya 
 Release one for zero-zero M Bleek R O C dot com 
 This philly cat back at it 
 Still throwin' crack at it 
 Still fuckin' with them crack-atics 
 Still bust 'em with them black matics 
 It's ain't the bucks, it's the rush 
 You tryin' to get my ass at it 
 They say I think ass backwards 
 Fuck how I act, as long as I stack, it's all mathematics 
 Our tracks nice, hug the block ta tract dice 
 Late night, club night, mac attract dikes

 Two guns, you know mac pack gat twice 
 Gets that crack back wit that ice 
 No joke wit the coke, I wips that right 
 No doubt, never droubt, gets that price 
 It gets that nice, when you live that live 
 Papi knows yours name 
 And you ditched that wife 
 Nigga it's gets stacked green nigga 
 It gets stacked chain nigga 
 I get forty G's a feature now 
 Hold Franklin's like a Aretha now 
 In the SL two seater now 
 And I'm in nothin' but diamonds 
 I'm the illest female that you heard thus far 
 Five-five with the thirty-four B-cup bra 
 I fuck wit dem cats who ain't up to par 
 I get niggas for cash, clothes, jeweleries, plus cars 
 I'm talkin' rent money, I'm talkin' bank money 
 I'm talkin' Martha Keats step of with the rent money 
 Movin' on up, two in the sauna 
 Still ride through the block, pull up on the corna, plus 
 Give me an inch so I can take a mile 
 I bring life like a new born naked child 
 Bitches tryin' ta come up, gotta wait a while 
 As of now, Amil-lion just played ya style, you dealin' with, nigga 
 The, the roc, the the, the roc 
 (Let me talk to y'all niggas real quick) 
 The, the roc, uh uh, the roc 
 Yo, y'all niggas truly ain't ready for this dynasty thing 
 Y'all thinkin' Blake Carrington, I'm thinkin' more like "ming 
 I got four nephews, and they all right in 
 They all young and wild, plus they all like things 
 And I'm havin' a child, which is more frighting 
 But y'all about to witness is big business kid 
 Big bosses, cocky, and big benzsesses 
 Come through flossin'em shiny rims it is 
 An office don't pop up in their sentences 
 I think you understand what type of event this is 
 I don't think you know I focus young Memphis is 
 Or I see was so real, when you add on Amil 
 This is much more than rap, it's black entrepreneur 
 Clothin', movie, and films, we come to conquer it all 
 Roc-A-Wear, eighty mill like, eighteen months 
 You could bullshit wit rap if you want, muthafuckers 
 When it's all said and done, we gon' see what's what 
 Holla at Hov, I'll be in the cut what 
 It's the, the roc, the the, the roc 
 It's the, the roc, the the roc 
 You rollin' with the roc 
 Dynasty niggas, that's right like no other 
 It's the, the roc, the the, the roc (Incomprehensible)
