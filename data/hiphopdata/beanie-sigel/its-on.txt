(Beanie Sigel) 
 Bare witness to the greatest, can't beat us join us 
 Keep heaters on us, with red lasers 
 Now far warning, short shots won't graze ya 
 We hug corners, play blocks like gators 
 With bundles on, serve tre's like waiters 
 It's the life we chose, the hustle 
 Can't stop it, can't knock it 
 Half the profit get flown out Vegas 
 Me and my niggas tryna break tables 
 Stack chips like Connect 4 
 While you pricks try and whip, tryna stretch more 
 Charge less for, that ain't the program 
 Get'cha lessons from the snowman 
 Like Pillsburry I get the dough man 
 I'll off ya head for a slice of bread 
 I keep my word and I'm true to my peeps 
 Gimme a bird and my crew 'gon eat 
 I'm over the stove like +Cuban Linx+ 
 Breakin down +Cash Money+ like +Baby+ do 
 You niggas soft like baby food 
 'Round the world niggas pay me dues 
 While you niggas sing the same old song like Sadies do (Jay-Z: same song) 
 Grown man, nigga baby who? 
 I send you shots from the baby zoo 
 Old game like Grady fool, propane flow flame you dudes 
 No names don't claim ya shoes 
 Once again it's on nigga 
 Sigel hard like corn liquor 
 I take you out this world like you was born nigga 
 Butt-naked, covered in blood, gaspin for air, clingin for dear life 
 Nigga you dead right? 
 (Jay-Z) 
 Since you was a baby, coward 
 We been sprinklin the world with baby powder 
 +So Fresh and So Clean+ 
 Been an +OutKast+ since I was a teen 
 But I outlast, 'cause I outblast anybody you bring 
 Young, you got it the prophet 
 I told y'all niggas then I showed y'all niggas 
 You +Can't Knock It+ 
 Don't get carried away you a mute nigga (mute nigga) 
 Where was you nigga? I was doin' this here like Mary J. 
 Like +Every Day+, It was true nigga 
 (Beanie Sigel) 
 They can't question what we do Jigga 
 (Jay-Z) 
 Once again it's on 
 Young run through you niggas, like a glitch in the computer nigga 
 I'm the shit I'mma sewer nigga, This is Jay everyday, no days off 
 Ferris Bueler nigga 
 (Beanie Sigel) 
 B Sig Fred Kruger niggas, nightmare ya medulla nigga 
 You scared? 'Cause I glue with Jigga 
 He said "Sig' you that nigga" couldn't see his vision 
 But then he drew the picture, like a compository sketch 
 Said if Sig stay honest I'll deposit you a check 
 It's a secret society, all we ask is trust 
 No G-Money shit, all we gots is us (we all we got) 
 True indeed, yes, more better, yes 
 More chedder, S-P chain, jeans, and sweaters 
 Movies, cartoons, labels, etcetera 
 Fill in the blanks and drop blocks like Tetris or 
 Get off the block run south with M. Betha 
 From my block to your block shout out to M-Extra 
 (Memphis Bleek: Who the fuck (fuck) want (want) what) 
 None of you niggas 
 It's B Sig prick I'm done with you niggas... 
 Once again it's on 
 Fuck we ain't through with niggas, twin towers here to ruin niggas 
 You couldn't break up the towers with Tom Donivich 
 Or Osama bombin' shit 
 We slay niggas with 'K's, we the drama men 
 Get it right young scrap don't even try it boy (boy) 
 You rather slide down a razor blade slidin board 
 I'm a livewire, hoolahoop barbwire 
 Run through hell with gasoline draws on 
 You can't mute me put the pause on 
 My gun shoot like fast-forward's on 
 You dress cute when the wars off 
 What you doin' dog you playin' wit it 
 You make ya bed right you layin in it 
 You keep your share tight, you stayin in it 
 You bringin' niggas where ya kids sleep 
 I sing to niggas while the kids sleep 
 Roc-a-bye mothafucka 
 I hope you high mothafucka 
 Ready to die mothafucka 
 Who shot ya? Seperate the weak from State Prop to 
 Kids squash beef and rep the streets 
 (Jay-Z) 
 Once again it's on nigga, bring the drama to ya lawn nigga 
 Tell ya momma bye bye get ready to mourn sista, it's a 
 See what you got here is a full blown twista 
 You nothin' but hot air, it's not fair 
 The reason while we lead the pack, this is a marathon 
 You start off fast, then you wheezin in the back 
 So even if I slack I got enough leeway to put out +The Reason+ by the +Mac+ 
 Philadelphia Freeway and I'm back, without leavin' and I'm here 
 But you can't see him, I gave you +The Blueprint+ but you can't be him 
 So no matter what you been told and the records you sold 
 Deep inside you know that it's only one Hov 
 Young veto, voice of the young people 
 If my life was a movie then +Sigel+ 'gon be the sequel 
 We bring it to ya door with Bleek peekin through ya peekhole 
 And don't get scared nigga, alert ya people 
 (Beanie Sigel) 
 Once again it's on
