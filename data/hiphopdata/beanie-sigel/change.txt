They say change gone come 
 But it's a long time comin' 
 My legs tired 
 Hundred million miles runnin' 
 On life's treadmill 
 Runnin' in place 
 But still I run wit the race 
 I think back on my wonder years 
 Food stamps shorts of wonder bread 
 My mom dukes 
 Young, wild, loose learned a less 
 I got my truths from the older heads 
 U went 2 church 'n' took a different route 
 U got ya truths from out the bishop mouth 
 I drunk the juice that turn dish about 
 Dem double duces turned my system out 
 And them zanies and the weed too 
 Fuck it I'm still here 
 (Rell) 
 Though its hard in the ghetto 
 Don't you let go 
 Cause a change gone come 
 Said a change gone come 
 I know your tired of the waitin 
 Hold ya patients 
 Cause a change gone come 
 Yeah I know it is 
 What it like 
 The big houses 
 The cars 
 The dog 
 Pickett fence 
 And you his wife 
 But depict this life 
 You know them FEDS 
 Got them pictures right 
 I know ya stressed baby girl 
 Feel what you going through 
 'Cause if they kick in that door 
 You know you going too 
 Cause every thing in ya name 
 From the phone bill 
 To the deed on the house 
 I gotta find a way to ease out 
 But you can't you feel trapped 
 You think back 
 Was it really worth it 
 This lifestyle could you really afford it 
 You then lost 4 lives 
 Yours and the 3 you aborted 
 (Girl) 
 But it's so
