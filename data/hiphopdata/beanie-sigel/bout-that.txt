How does it feel bein' next to you 
 I wanna know how, just let me know 
 I got them diamonds on my neck, I'm so icey 
 I think they like Sig', in them white tees 
 Them SB jeans, sneaks is me 
 Dark green with the camouflage print 
 Fake Willies wanna know what's the damage I spent 
 On that new V-Twizzy, grown man with no fence 
 Roughly the cost about three bricks off 
 Cooked up then bagged in trays, have a nice day 
 I'm in my bag and I'm havin' it my way 
 Sick of the floss, sick of cars, you niggaz car-sick 
 Sick of seein' Sig' in them large whips 
 No plates and offended, temp plates in the window 
 If you could see the garage I back in there 
 Niggaz grind all summer then be crack in the winter 
 I'm never cracked, one number I'm back in, yeah 
 It's always Mac, nigga the top spender 
 Just check your boy out in all his splendor 
 How I grind in the winter, cop up in the spring 
 Wait for the summer to show off my new things 
 And in the fall, I do just that, I fall back 
 And listen to the rumors on how I'm all that 
 You see this shit? Boy, I copped all that 
 Yes, I can cover the bet as you should 
 However do you want it just drop it's all good 
 Money, cars, cash, clothes 
 Beans says if you bout that shit then let me know 
 If you bout that shit then let me know 
 If you bout that shit then let me know 
 Money, cars, cash, clothes 
 Baby girl, if you bout that shit then let me know 
 If you bout that shit then let me know 
 If you bout that shit then let me know 
 I show you how to do this, dude 
 I done turned more blocks into Rubik's Cube 
 You boy, let off shots from that newest tool 
 Then I skate on cops in that newest cruise 
 I'm rich boy, ah, look at here 
 Blow up icey and rich but your jewels ain't lookin' clear 
 I show you lil' dudes how to cook a square 
 And how to grind it to the limit when you push it, yeah 
 You don't want it with Sig', I pull your card out 
 You ain't got no bitches now bring them broads out 
 We can go chip for chip, I pull some large out 
 Or go whip for whip, I bring them cars out 
 Bring the Benz out, bring the Aston-Mart' out 
 Porsche Box' or the drop top Ferrar' out 
 Bring the old school six-fours out, coops to the four doors out 
 Cool and Dre, bring the chorus out 
 Money, cars, cash, clothes 
 Beans says if you bout that shit then let me know 
 If you bout that shit then let me know 
 If you bout that shit then let me know 
 Money, cars, cash, clothes 
 Baby girl, if you bout that shit then let me know 
 If you bout that shit then let me know 
 If you bout that shit then let me know 
 However do you want it, bitch, I ain't stutter 
 You fuckin' with that dude 
 Man, I lay 'em gutted that nigga 'dere pop 
 And I done lost more work in a pot than y'all ever copped 
 Right cat, wrong litter box and I don't window shop 
 And I don't lease, I just pick and cop 
 I got the title to the shit I got 
 You need that work, I'm on the boat by the river dock 
 I put you niggaz in a triple threat soon as I hit The Roc 
 Niggaz claim they ballin' but can't hit the shot 
 Yeah, I'm flagrant, this ain't your game kid 
 Stay in your lane or get your shit blocked, how you want it? 
 Money, cars, cash, clothes 
 Beans says if you bout that shit then let me know 
 If you bout that shit then let me know 
 If you bout that shit then let me know 
 Money, cars, cash, clothes 
 Baby girl, if you bout that shit then let me know 
 If you bout that shit then let me know 
 If you bout that shit then let me know 
 However do you, however do you 
 Gangsters, pop that shit and let me know
