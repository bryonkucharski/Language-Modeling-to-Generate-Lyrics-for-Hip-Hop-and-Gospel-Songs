It's like I got a death wish, but niggas can't kill me 
 Live my long these real niggas gotta feel me 
 The media, they ridicule me 
 Heartless is how they really fez 
 Wanna prosecute me till I'm living in the cell 
 Or I rot in hell 
 Will I die in these streets only time will tell 
 Until then I pop pills, sip my purple 
 Spread love, money and guns throughout my circle 
 Make the ass out the feds every case I beat 
 Middle finger to the law nigga fuck police 
 For my niggas over the wall who they won't let free 
 And all the soldier that we've lost, may they rest in peace 
 Tell your mother who's alive, who said crime don't pay 
 Nigga fuck how you get it homie find your way 
 Young bucks keep your guns pulled enemies closer 
 Smile, look death in his eyes 
 Where I'm from it's dangerous 
 It's dangerous, every day, every day 
 Cops ? shot? no ? raised in the ghetto 
 I'm just a product of the block 
 Where I'm from it's dangerous 
 It's dangerous, every day, every day 
 Cops ? shot? no ? raised in the ghetto 
 I'm just a product of the block 
 The ghetto cold, the block hot 
 Niggas talking, nosy neighbors and everything 
 But a coffin, the hood filled with dope fiends and street walkers 
 Babies crying, hop signs, dogs barking 
 Crime scene, yellow tape, the street chalking 
 Bloody sheet cover the face of the departed 
 The blood drop and then she hardens 
 Cops celebrate the ? gun, this often 
 Young bitch 14 6 months pregnant 
 Sell her body on the corner, smoke weed on a regular 
 Get a pimp off her money, dope man he was? 
 Last week raped twice forced abortions 
 It's the life that I'm living ghetto that I'm lost in 
 And I'mma be here till they put me in the coffin 
 Feeling like pac live and die in Phillie 
 And I'm riding till these niggas come and kill me 
 Where I'm from it's dangerous 
 It's dangerous, every day, every day 
 Cops ? shot? no ? raised in the ghetto 
 I'm just a product of the block 
 Where I'm from it's dangerous 
 It's dangerous, every day, every day 
 Cops ? shot? no ? raised in the ghetto 
 I'm just a product of the block 
 My crystal popping on politicians and scooping watching 
 Pop a ? on who you blaming on cops lock them 
 A jail cell can't rehabilitate a nigga 
 They raise your bell and give a crack dealer life sentence 
 Turn around and give a pedal to the floor till you fall 
 That's why a prison door, over a revolving door 
 3 hots and a ? it's all we got, ? for Big and Pac 
 Who ever knew when that child was born 
 He'd be Barack 
 44th president to be black, you gotta deal with that 
 Confess that I heard were crack, we gotta deal with that 
 Wonder why we put in the bags and throw still with that 
 See a phantom like beans I kill for that 
 Hood nigga going rich, now I got a mill for that 
 Law suit she's bringing, swear I've been through 
 With paying nigga in full, it's getting shot through his fuel 
 Known thug, since my brother got killed in cold blood 
 So would I avenge his death, so would I sell drugs 
 Promised to be a real nigga to the death of me 
 Bury my casket to the block with the rest of me 
 And let my headstone really was a father 
 Any nigga that thought he went hard, I went harder 
 So state out my bidness and off my mind 
 I take a shot to the downfall, I'm on my grind 
 Where I'm from it's dangerous 
 It's dangerous, every day, every day 
 Cops ? shot? no ? raised in the ghetto 
 I'm just a product of the block 
 Where I'm from it's dangerous 
 It's dangerous, every day, every day 
 Cops ? shot? no ? raised in the ghetto 
 I'm just a product of the block
