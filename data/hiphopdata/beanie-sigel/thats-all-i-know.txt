 You wonder why I'm still on the block 
 'Cause I just can't leave it babe 
 'Cause that's all I know 
 Throw the gut away when you see the cops come back and retrieve it babe 
 'Cause that's all I know 
 'Cause that's how we roll 
 From the gut straight to your front door 
 'Cause that's all I know 
 A bunch of thug niggas put them appetite 
 Then you know we gonna feel it babe 
 'Cause that's all I know 
 So the top it's my destiny to the death in me 
 Baking soul and ice was the recipe 
 Big boy in the big toy plane watch connecting with the connect 
 Soon as the fame stop 
 Some said that I lost it I don't know what they talking 
 They used to be Ross it 
 They used to be boss it 
 Tony dances with two bitches who the boss 
 And use to the best back to back you exhausted 
 That the paws in that cuatro got the cars 
 On a block with the property nobody guards 
 Before out look us the main wows 
 For a way hard 
 Don't forget my hot sauce gotta let your 
 You wonder why I'm still on the block

 'Cause that's all I know 
 My mama made me, the block raised me 
 Raggon baby, pradagot the aimies 
 New one day I'll be big shit to be gravy 
 Once I got the white girl silk like the navy 
 Before they say a point so was born a baby 
 Crush ice wonder 200 spice is got me lazy 
 Never had the unidentified the block paid me 
 Eaten all the rocks before the rock paid me 
 That's all I know it's this ghetto 
 Late nights where you had shot echo 
 This the hood life, this the good life 
 Young love turn the good day to a shoot night 
 Gotta love right 
 You wonder why I'm still on the block 
 'Cause I just can't leave it babe

 Top of discussion at the beauty of line 
 French frize at five fity movies at nine 
 Get out of line they barbecue you like the forth for July 
 Tryin' to survive just to get by like wow 
 Ash trip game near nigga like ah

 In the hood you try to turn the back so good times 
 Get rich of die tryin' shit

 Get George get mine juts don't stop my grind 
 Put the dub on your head but I ain't droppin' the dime 
 Shit I turn this bitch out of the project water
