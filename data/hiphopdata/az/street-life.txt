 AZ intro 
 Yeah Devine Intervention 
 Miliato, Begetz, AZ 
 Quiet Money Presents. 
 (Half-A-Mil) (R.I.P.) 
 Now the twin towers done blew up 
 Niggaz seen the footage and threw up 
 I got platinum bullets for y'all to chew up 
 Mil-latin the dog done grew up 
 Is it still Manhatten I speak street slang arab-a-latin 
 My gunz speak rat-a-ta-in 
 Understand my lingo 
 I'm from Albany Afganistan 
 Fuck Chris Cringo and Christopher Columbus 
 I'll shoot scud missles through his kango and spray z gas 
 On ya faggot ass 
 Allah you akba, make 767's crash 
 Smack Jesus Christ and smoke a half a pound of hash 
 I keep a half a pound of cash 
 I thought I told you cats 
 I'm not a rapper 
 Rock a G on my chest that stands for god 
 Fuck Dan I'm dapper 
 Prada from head to toe 
 Dollars, cherries in the moe 
 You fake ass pimps, get my chips 
 So I'm burying you and your hoes 
 I plant plutonium bombs after each and every show 
 So every artist you sign is guaranteed to blow 
 I'm guaranteed to flow 
 Puffin that magic weed 
 Knowledge itself nigga that's what you need 
 So fuck you and those crabs that you feed, tell 'em holla at me 
 New York New York with blood in your ice 
 Put numbers on your head killa name your price 
 We gets love where ever we go 
 Cause the street life is all we know 
 It's all we know 
 (Begetz) 
 I work for a quarter million in dope 
 A million dollars in cash 
 1.5 under the bathroom stash 
 Put that little ass gun away nigga 
 Step up your murder game 
 Still fuckin' wit weed 
 Step up to heroine 
 Cardiay diamond links no more gold chains 
 Vertical doors, candy paint, and woodgrain 
 I'm the one to watch niggaz don't cover your eyes 
 So many eyes on my watch got 'em hypnotized 
 Fuckin' with hustlers ballin like rap niggaz, throwin' money in the air screemin I ain't gotta rap niggaz 
 The 9 m & m ain't sweet like candy 
 Got mines on me front row with a grammy 
 Slugs on the left and lust on the right 
 Fuck an award boo we'll take you home tonight 
 Milli gates in the spyder with the glass roof 
 Damn near crashed in valet off that over proofed shit, we drunk 
 (AZ) 
 I got one son, two guns, a couple of cribs 
 Just tryin' to live 
 Fuck gettin' stuck with a bid 
 Niggaz I fuck with now 
 Used to fuck with his kids 
 Slim dude food never stuck to my ribs 
 Been tried on occasions 
 I lie with persuasion 
 Hustled out of town nearly died in a Days Inn 
 Breezed on a turnpike 
 Received then returned kites 
 Cold D to O.G homie nigga earn strikes 
 Burnt mics 
 Left 'em there to sizzle for shizzle 
 You know the dizzle my nizzle 
 I'm so visual 
 All jewels tiz you paid dues true to the grizzle 
 Blew a few mil and still official 
 BIG we still miss you 
 The games real fical 
 It's two thou and a nickel 
 Nigga trying to go triple 
 Until I'm there wit you 
 A wheel chair cripple 
 It's no secret I'm a keep it popin like a pistol
