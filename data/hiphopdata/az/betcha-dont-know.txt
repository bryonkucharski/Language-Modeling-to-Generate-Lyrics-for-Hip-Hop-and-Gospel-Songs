Intro/Chorus: (x2) 
 Betcha don't know what's goin' on 
 If you don't know, we're gonna show you, ooh 
 It's on now, New Year, pop the pain 
 Sun blaze through the grey cloud, stop the rain 
 Shear shirts by Chanel, baby, feel the breeze 
 Drop top, me and shorty, while she be at my knees 
 Let the wind blow, low fade, peep the glow 
 Know my style from the foul days, keep it low 
 Got new plans, worldwide, livin' the life 
 Any chick I make wife gon' shiver tonight 
 Know the game, it's ups and downs learnin the ropes 
 26 years of age, just learnin to cope 
 Came a long way but still got so far to go 
 So by now, I guess you know, talk to me 
 What if we all had minds alike? Thought the same 
 Only few was taught to get this, divorce the game 
 Visualized as a young cat, saw the dream 
 Get large, shit hard, and assorted CREAM 
 So many came that I saw and went wise on my ways 
 Made livin' for me more intense, divided my days 
 Weekends, party nights, raffled the stakes 
 Love sophisticated women, those that rather you wait 
 Tipped it off from the finest juice to 90 proof 
 Rocked it all, from designer suits to climbin boots 
 All in the summertime, workin the courts 
 Lookin' mommy wit them thick legs, hurtin' them shorts 
 So many ladies in the world today searchin for mates 
 Got these non-players perpin for dates, hold up 
 Give me love if you've got it in ya, hot as Virginia 
 Hot enough for me to slide this up in ya 
 Got the solar, Nat King Cole in his prime 
 So behold that, shoes unfold in each rhyme 
 Move accordin like the Chosen Ones roamin the Earth 
 Gettin' head until I'm dead, decompose in the dirt 
 Play the same spot, bitch cast, lost it all 
 Rollin' dice and G you're better, now you forced to ball 
 Havin' fun at the main event, toastin cups 
 Quarter pieces tryin' to get yours roastin up 
 Play the game if you got toys to match your words 
 You a vet, throw your net, nigga, catch some birds 
 Only a few left, still sincere, spread love 
 Thank God, it's a heaven above, talk to me 
 Chorus to fade
