Lord knows I try 
 Get high, get high, get high 
 I got haze blue and strawberry dro and diesel 
 I got kush and cannabis and all shades are lethal 
 Enough to puff with all my people 
 Chunks in the truck like the stuff was legal 
 Nothin' but dutches I'm amongst the evils 
 Bongs to breathe through my first time was preeschool 
 Get high, Get fly, Get lye 
 I got tons of guns but I love that mac 
 Automatics love to tug those back 
 Snubnoses for my hoes that pack 
 Big toys like them boys in Iraq 
 Click clacks'll put your brains in your lap 
 Open on that's the first time I blacked 
 I got Gucci, Pradas, Louis and all 
 I got it for the spring, the summer, the winter, fall 
 I got Bagarvy shades, Chrichendiors 
 Tims and hoodies just for war 
 Suits and hardbottoms respect no law 
 Open in the mall the first time I Balled 
 I got chicks that's all thick and in shape, and love it 
 Flicks and videos, shit, I does it 
 Some that cry, cum, and some that's rugged 
 One that's sprung when she done she hum it 
 One home body and one I run with 
 Ménage, massage, and word to God 
 Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha 
 Lord knows I did 
 I got cribs in the suburbs, the hood, and the city 
 A low crib with the wiz that's pretty 
 A crew crib where niggas bring biddies 
 A crib out mid, that's hid like Diddy's 
 A tropic spot out in the Caymans 
 A Cali spot the first time I copped 
 I got love for thugs and hustlers period 
 Hate for snakes I take that serious 
 Respect for ballers and those that stack 
 Appreciation for broads with back 
 Death for losers that snitch and tell 
 My homie homes first day on bail 
 I got 5 albums out 4 to go 
 A paper fetish I love the dough 
 Love for V's that speed and blow 
 Knowledge of self if you need to know 
 Patrone, Crissy, even Cleeko 
 Bitch so big I had to a pimp 
 Haha 
 I tried, I tried
