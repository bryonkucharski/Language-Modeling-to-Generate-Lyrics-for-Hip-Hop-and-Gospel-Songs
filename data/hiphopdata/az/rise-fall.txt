(Feat. Big Pooh, Phonte) 
 (Rapper Big Pooh:) 
 Cold as the cold in the wintertime 
 Slow rhyme when I rhyme, no beginner I'm 
 City walk when they sin tryna make a dime 
 They don't ask for too much, just a lil' shine 
 Lil' time on the grind tryin' get that gwap 
 Wah'n't worth eight years for your first time pop 
 Now you back rehabilitated, punchin the clock 
 Old neighborhood witnessin your man and 'nem drop 
 Got the drop on that nigga said he runnin' the block 
 Graduated from the greens to servin' up rock 
 So you plot and you think and you sin on the plan 
 On some scheme-ass shit but, that's your man 
 I'm sayin', you tryna push reasons to the front 
 And put a block on that other shit you want 
 But the streets keep callin ya name 
 An 9-to-5 slave to the rhythm ain't bringin' you fame 
 So it's back to the game, round up a lil' gang 
 Set it up to stick ya manye but he stick you first 
 Goodbye! 
 I seen 'em rise, seen 'em fall (seen 'em fall) 
 Seen 'em come, seen 'em go, seen 'em all (seen 'em all) 
 Seen stars wit dey name on the wall 
 Till the money get tight and the limelight's gone (light's gone) 
 (Rapper Big Pooh:) 
 3 A.M. in the backseat leanin' 
 Thinkin' 'bout all the things I've seen, man 
 (Phonte:) 
 Remember (-member), befo niggaz was on the bandwagon... 
 I fell asleep till the sound of hand cannons 
 Leavin' holes in souls the size of Grand Canyons 
 Late nights (?) streets with my man Brandon 
 Fast forward, twelve years now we grandstandin 
 Because I'm main-taining, wit'out man-tanin 
 And it made me an ani-mal 
 But I need another quota book for the catalog 
 I could dumb down and rap for bitches and alcohol 
 But I'm too loud, and too proud to tap-dance for these crackers, dawg 
 So, won't be no Gregory Hine-it 
 When Tay get hostle, he in the gospel like he in the Winans 
 And right now, he in there finding 
 A new platform for the rhymes that I arranged 
 A new ideas for the lines that I exchanged 
 'Cause I can't be, a laughingstock homie, that'll be a crying shame 
 All I need is six bars and an intro 
 'Cause I relate to these beats like it was kinfolks 
 And the flow's so fresh like Mentos 
 And this is all real talk, that's for your info 
 Cause that's where I been, yo, ho! 
 I seen 'em rise, seen 'em fall (seen 'em fall) 
 Seen 'em come, seen 'em go, seen 'em all (seen 'em all) 
 Seen stars wit dey name on the wall 
 Till the money get tight and the limelight's gone (light's gone) 
 (Phonte:) 
 Uh, 3 A.M. in the backseat leanin' 
 Thinkin' 'bout all the things I've seen, man 
 (AZ:) 
 Grindin, time limb 
 Muh'fucker back up, stepped-up muh'fucker 
 So quiet, I coulda crept on a sucker (ah!) 
 From behind and blew the breath out the busta (poooow!) 
 But instead, held my head like a hustl-er 
 Pumped-up and get the sound of the muffler 
 Heard him clown bout his pounds bein fluffier 
 Tellin' niggaz outta town they be luckier 
 And get sad when the hood had enough of ya 
 Broke niggaz buck at cha, poke you in ya jugga-ler 
 But when you high, you feel niggaz can't fuck wit ya 
 I'm surprised some niggaz still had customers 
 (?) My eyes and inhaled my smoke 
 Tryna decide, should I let him slide - but nope! 
 He broke ties when he spoke his lies 
 Tell his pi's that he hope I die, so my reply is 
 To "Keep it real, I hope you could fly" 
 'Cause I'ma send him to them open skies 
 (Gah! Gah! Rrraaah! Rrraaah!) 
 I seen 'em rise, seen 'em fall (seen 'em fall) 
 Seen 'em come, seen 'em go, seen ï¿½em all (seen 'em all) 
 Seen stars wit dey name on the wall 
 Till the money get tight and the limelight's gone (light's gone)
