What's the use of me of me foolin myself? 
 No matter what I keep tellin' myself...

 (I don't believe this... I'm makin' all these moves... for 
 Whatt???) 
 I do me for a G Note, niece, she's yellin' Nemo 
 Mama bear, she there, losin hair cause of the chemo 
 Every door buzz, little cause see at the peek hole 
 Swearin he holdin' heavy, hidin out from the RICO 
 Coke sold by Chico out the corner bodega 
 Him 'n' Bobbito... la familia now finito! 
 It's deep tho, it's like my soul was stole by the repo 
 Resowed in Carlito, and retold on Tivo 
 Ice cold wit a ego, dice rolled and somebody's Deebo'd 
 Trios expose dikes on the D' Low 
 It's love wit my amigos, other niggaz they freeload 
 Yeah he hold, but my homeys only unload torpedoes 
 So please yo, I'm from the killa cap of the kilos 
 Where niccaz clap, and fat bytches get yapped for 
 Their cheetos, its re-al 
 But still blocks is hot like veal 
 So cock block, or cop shot, nothin' stops the P.O. 
 What's the use of me of me foolin myself? (lalalalalaaa

 No matter what I keep tellin' myself... (Wont Stooooopp 
 Can't Stooooooop)

 Wifee want an abortion, her parents divorcin 
 Granted, I understand it, but my man's in a coffin 
 Who planned it? I guess they panicked, 'cause they left him in Boston 
 He died... for a pie, identified by his porcelains 
 It's caution, Unc just got a chunk of some fortune 
 Bossin, I guess the paper supportin extortin 
 Tossin it to them dealers, takin' it like Lakers did Portland 
 Cases is costin, so faces wont make it for talkin' 
 It's basics, they mistake once they replace it for flossin 
 It soften, never high when dividin my portion 
 Why forever fly till I die, dry from exhaustion 
 Move accordin, like they keys on a organ 
 No sneezin or coffin, I weeze when I'm walkin', indeed 
 We under siege from those D's 'cause they stalkin 
 Cars is auctioned, homes is seized 
 OG's extortin the seeds, now it's the new breed absorbin 
 The names is changed, the games the same 
 It's playin' fair, but years of Nightmares, like Dana Dane 
 It ain't clear, but I'm right here still and sayin' the same 
 Refusin to shed a tear, tho the pain done came 
 Provin I played the game, from cocain to fame 
 From rope chains, gazelli frames, I remain to blame 
 It's deep, but never speak certain names in vein 
 I know beef, and when it peak, it can strain the brain 
 No police, its just creep creep, bang for bang 
 No grief, brothers deceased, others arraigned and hang 
 None of us just eatin, maintain the strains 
 The streets is just the streets, when it rain it rain
