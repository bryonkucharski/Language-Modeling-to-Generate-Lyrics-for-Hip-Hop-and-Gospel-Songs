(Nature) 
 At the ripe age 24, I done seen it all done it all 
 Some dreams stay fresh and some are spoiled 
 Dealin' with time went to spring, summer, fall 
 Its crazy changes, is this that made me famous? 
 I come a long way from Tims, minimum wages 
 Stockin caps summer jobs pockets flat 
 It's funny how my childhood idols now be copin cracks 
 Ain't knockin' at them, fortunately life is too short to see 
 It's only right we move accordingly at every second 
 I use to carry heavy weapons, previously cocked 
 Tucked in my shirt for every session, but hold up 
 The two-six beer made me grow up 
 Came home to the damn same dream with no luck 
 And half the clique strong, the other half moved on 
 Some with new lives and new wives niggaz live long 
 The foulest thing about time is still ticks when you gone 
 (Nas) 
 For those who lived the way I lived we came from a long way 
 From wipin coal from our eye lids from raps hottest 
 Smokin' lye to the track guidance, 'member back then 
 Before Mack 10's expensive bottles, had a sick mind 
 Niggaz taught me how to get mine 
 We often sit courts they get tossed that get spit line 
 To all niggaz that the Lord seemed to legit time 
 Why we plan to live for-ev he had a different design 
 Is it safe to say we all parish on the sacred day 
 With my luck soon as I reach the gate that made me pay... pray 
 Minutes go by indo-go-high the specialist decked out dark specks finessin 
 Used to play catch a kiss same girls back then now leave us messages 
 A whole lot, travel to my old spot where we sold rock although its trifle 
 Ain't nothin' changed as like time is all a cycle

 Yo, wake up to the world stay in charge of your dream 
 Keep your vision focus get wise and large your cream 
 Marketin scheme so many in the dark it's un-seemed 
 Caught up between perhaps rap was a fortunate thing 
 Forced to be king from hustlin to supportin them fiends 
 Bustin' guns, I had no remorse as a team 
 Rockin' bird stones my first get big nursed a dome 
 Its hurts to zone now I realize I'm on the surface alone 
 Time ticks devilish mind design quits leave you line quick 
 And cause you to die behind shit, mathematics 
 Master 120 I'm Aziatic, I'm amazed with magic 
 Cousins with loosen that made me savage 
 Life changed once you established with the right game 
 Love the night vane found the new way to fight pain 
 Clocks never stop, it's all the way to the top 
 Trying to freeze time that's why I iced the face on my watch
