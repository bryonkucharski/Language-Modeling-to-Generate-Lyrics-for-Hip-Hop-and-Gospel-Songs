All our days are numbered 
 Some live on borrowed time 
 But life is what you make it 
 Thank God I was so inclined 
 To accept my Lord and Savior 
 When the good news sunk in 
 He paid a heavenly price 
 By giving His life 
 And I can't wait to go home to Him 
 I'm ready to go that distance 
 And God only knows when that might be 
 But oh, what joy waits up yonder 
 Once this old world sets me free 
 When there's no tomorrow 
 And glory has come down 
 Those without Jesus 
 Are lost and never to be found 
 So please listen when I'm talking 
 I'm just saying what needs to be said 
 Make plans while your still living 
 It's too late when your dead 
 I'm ready to go that distance 
 And God only knows when that might be 
 But oh, what joy waits up yonder 
 Once this old world sets me free 
 Oh, once this old world sets me free
