Intro: Nas 
 Gimme, just gimme, for the NYC 
 Gimme what you can't get back 
 Gimme, why don't you gimme the world 
 Gimme what you can't get back, for the five burroughs 
 Verse 1: AZ 
 Yo, it's hard to show resistance when money-gettin' niggas 
 Need my assistance to stock figures, beyond non-existence 
 Fuck keepin' my distance, 'cause bein poor produced persistence 
 Plus plea's, a hundred G's, I had me blockin out of jail centres 
 I'm recognised by the illest of individuals 
 Killers and criminals, even willies that's really into jewels 
 But still sceptic on who I cling to 
 'Cause every single nigga that swing through, ain't my man just 'cause we mingle 
 To mistake shit, even females be feedin off that fake shit 
 Filled with envy and hatred but my high hopes help me escape it 
 Temporarily the window world, don't read the wise 
 Verbally nourish me, properly with that inner city, urban GC 
 I fucked with those beyond my age bracket 
 'Cause they analyse and mack to get the papers and stack it 
 Leavin' no trace to track it, keep on thinkin' tappers is accurate 
 That mack shit, livin' the lifestyle, we filled with black wit 
 Chorus: Nas, (AZ) 
 Just gimme (Pimp lines and dollar signs) 
 Just gimme (Rollin' trees, stackin G's) 
 Gimme what you can't get back (True dat, I thought you knew that) 
 Just gimme (Money getters, the high bidders) 
 Why don't you gimme the world (rollin' wit us) 
 Gimme what you can't get back, for the five burroughs 
 Verse 2: AZ 
 So in God I trust, I lust for a 850-deluxe 
 And in too, I touch a million-plus, ain't much to discuss 
 Diamonds and double-digits, Gianni Versace down with lizards 
 It's realism so I visualisin to live it 
 Movin cleverly wit intentions of longevity 
 Strong pedigree got me touchin papers, others would never see, G 
 So do the crest in my claw, flourescents 
 Symbolises the essence, you're sailin in a sweppervescence 
 Drug investments, a street thug's plug, the insurance, but informers 
 They had you wanted for warrants 'fore you get enormous 
 Life's a performance so players play wit endurance 
 'Cause from war sense, any villain's willing to get more intense 
 They tried to break us but all it did was just make us 
 Travel across acres for papers, bonafide money takers 
 'Cause though we know somehow we all gotta go 
 As long as we're leavin' thievin, we'll be leavin' wit some kind of doe, 
 So... 
 Chorus: Nas, (AZ) 
 Just gimme (Pimp lines and dollar signs) 
 Just gimme (Rollin' trees, stackin G's) 
 Gimme what you can't get back (True dat, I thought you knew that) 
 Just gimme (Money getters, the high bidders) 
 Why don't you gimme the world (rollin' wit us) 
 Gimme what you can't get back (It's real, NYC) 
 Just gimme (QB) 
 Just gimme (B-K, VT) 
 Gimme what you can't get back (See me, AZ y'all, representin) 
 Just gimme (Yeah, the street life is trife life) 
 Why don't you gimme the world (Representin) 
 Gimme what you can't get back (Life's a bitch...)
