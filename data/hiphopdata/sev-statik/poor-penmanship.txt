Should I -have the more well known emcees on this release 
 Or maybe bring a new voice for the audience to meet 
 I could have the most radio friendly hooks and flows 
 But now know y'all ain't my friends in a minute turn foe 
 Because of the intrikit ways- the infinite displays 
 How my cadence moves and what my spirit has to say 
 I'ma tunnel rat - I'm a lip creatin' beats 
 I'm verbal combat - when challenged on these streets 
 I'ma meddafore - I don't sell in gospel stores 
 I'm milk crate - filled with 808's and beat breaks 
 Thought I told y'all - but y'all never really listened 
 I ain't here to bring unity - I was sent to cause division 
 And from that - some will get this highly twisted 
 Low lifes who open they mouths and start dissin' 
 Without really hearing - the message now communicated 
 The vs being finished - now you can all start hatin' 
 I've combined my words with a passion that's rarely seen 
 Brought to the extreme length it's hard to catch a glimpse 
 Yes indeed I make the last minute stretch to fit my ability 
 And I'm realizin' now - I need a whole day's time 
 Infinitely, I make my rounds - 360 complete 
 Alleviate my bad dreams by never falling asleep 
 The insomniac on break beats y'all never want to meet 
 Seize ya whole compound to imprison ya whole fleet 
 Endulge in stress matches spar with self esteem 
 I'm far from being conerned with being hard by industry 
 Standardz commander in chief 
 Keep my vessel clean - supremly spotless I got this M.I. 
 C. held too tight - that's why my words is sloppy when I write 
 For my eyes only and sound to recite 
 So if this truth is not for you - keep steppin smith 
 I hold rich words to serve out - poor penmanship 
 I am now concerned about the after life - before death 
 Born into a dead world to speak life through text 
 My rep, my steps and every exhaling breath 
 To make sure my name is displayed in the lambs book 
 Arranged in heavenly letters - put togetha in fine thought 
 Across golden lines - cause my soul'ez been bought 
 Sold to the highest bidda - who's blood stained cross 
 Freed the shackled mind - and made me a nine 
 Even tho I hold no cuss words - I swear on His promise 
 To return like a thief - and lay claim to the meek 
 I speak on topics relavant to earth worms of sorts 
 And unsheeth the written sword - of 66 books 
 Take a look - as we pass these last days at high speeds 
 We indeed are in need of these TR emceez 
 Now free to release - His word over beats 
 Sev Statik - poor penmanship - till the INK depletes
