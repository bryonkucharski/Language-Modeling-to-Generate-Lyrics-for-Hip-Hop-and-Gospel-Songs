My man was deep in love it was almost sickening 
 Couldn't leave the house unless his girlfriend was with him 
 Bought her the flyest gear took trips around the world 
 His phone was always busy yappin' to his girl 
 I wasn't hatin' on my man I was like do ya thing son 
 Never know - she might be the one 
 Come to think about it y'all look good together 
 I'm happy for you duke hope it lasts forever 
 I didn't wanna get between such a good thing 
 They my man got inspired and pulled out a ring 
 Got down on one knee and started to propose 
 But before he could finish this chic was like "no" 
 Said she wasn't ready - and bolted out the door 
 My man was in shock and totally floored 
 Just let her go bruh - she'll be back for sure 
 If it was meant to be then she's worth waiting for 
 She's 16 years young and very depressed 
 A beautiful girl but she's trying to impress 
 This fool at school but he could care less 
 Now losing weight to fit a certain size dress 
 She lives inside magazines she gets 
 Wants blue eyes and much bigger breasts 
 Believes all the lies - readin'em right to left 
 Twisting it backwards so there's no self respect 
 And she's crying actually thinking about dying 
 Taking her own life cause the mirror ain't supplying 
 That visual - that she wants to see 
 So now she contemplates getting plastic surgery 
 It's all real - all this for one lowly guy 
 He's only here for the curves he ain't down for the ride 
 I'm trying to say you've already been blessed 
 So close the magazine you're too young for this stress 
 Ya just got home today got off the plane 
 Got plans to make got dates to take 
 No rain in the sky but you see some clouds 
 Now it's lookin' like smoke this ain't no joke 
 Downtown is your direction with heads lookin' up 
 Staring at they faces and they all shookin' up 
 So you ask the cab to please stop right here 
 Mixed with curiosity and fear 
 And just before steppin' out you see this low flying plane 
 This cat's insane he not right in the brain 
 Feelin' that something was odd and things about to change 
 Ya intuition was late there was already flames 
 Bellowing out the massive hole in the first tower 
 Outta control with smoke and debris giving showers 
 To cover the skyline and street landscapes 
 No escape for ground zero and ill determined fate 
 The 2nd plane hit you knew it was time to go 
 Like mos, nate and pharaoh ya whole vibe was like "oh no" 
 And you fell down and cried 
 Then something inside made you lose ya mind 
 Well all need change - now 
 Before it's too late - right now 
 Ain't no delay - now 
 What's the time - right here right now
