 We all know FWA's, how they lay 
 'Cause they figure if you're bumpin the pays 
 In the long run, and it's all fun in their eyes 
 They must be on one how, they prepare lies 
 Get up close make you think, you the host of the ceremonies 
 Why you ain't peepin like a doggy mark his territory 
 They're never there for me when I need a little boost 
 Because of who you are, they can get a little juice 
 Then they like to seemingly leans up on your shoulders 
 Otherwise he's steppin on toes gettin' over 
 Flappin his molars talkin' 'bout he owe you 
 And every time he smoke, he don't show you no love 
 And be the first fool with his lips on the blunt 
 If he persists to front I'ma commenced to dump 
 Be careful when you make a little something that's yours 
 Cause a lot of these predators want yours to be theirs 
 Or at least own a share just by bein there 
 I be on some hermit skit, and fools think I'm square now 
 There's an interesting way to look at it 
 I look at them as bein fake, the way they took advantage 
 Speaking on the crooks of the planet, who claim they got game 
 Yeah you the game and they the hunter; just one more
