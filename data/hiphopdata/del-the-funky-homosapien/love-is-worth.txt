Okay 
 You got to know what your love is worth 
 Every boy you got to know what your love is worth 
 Every girl you got to know what your love is worth 
 Everybody got to know what their love is worth 
 Yeah, you got to know what your love is worth 
 As soon as a child is born and discovers self 
 It's a part of life, so don't get fucked in the end 
 If someone's a lost cause, there'll be someone up his cardigan 
 Example, you a woman, in a relationship 
 It seems like everything you do makes him flip 
 It ain't physical violence, or nothing like that 
 But the love that you show he doesn't show back 
 But it started when you first met 
 You looked incredible to him, he wanted to get his thirst wet 
 (Yeah, I bet) 
 He wanted to be down like Brandy 
 At first his overbearing persona was so manly (ooh) 
 But now you're thinkin' most of the time, "he can't stand me" 
 He lost trust in you when he saw you with Randy (haha) 
 But then you find out he feel good about Candy 
 You thinkin' this relationship is really demanding 
 Everyone makes mistakes and that's true 
 But from the beginning did he really love you? 
 To him you a bitch, he told his boys he thugged you out 
 And nowadays he don't even hug you (doubts) 
 And I'm sure it do more than bug you 
 You wonder how you get attracted to things 
 With a mackin' disease, with a tactic to please 
 But once you settle down you're entrapped in a squeeze 
 Like a boa constrictor and he know when he gets ya 
 You got to know what your love is worth 
 That way you don't waste ??? goin' berserk 
 Yeah, (chorus) x2 
 (Guys talking) 
 Now put yourself in the shoes of this guy 
 You fall in love with this girl and you don't know why (why dude?) 
 Cause you don't feel the same but you give it a try 
 Eyes wide, like you a child in a candy store 
 Even though you the one she couldn't stand before 
 Cause you was houndin' her, surroundin' her (damn) with confusion 
 You used to be friends, but now the friendship is losin' 
 Cause you visualize the romance, she like "no hands on" 
 She don't wanna fuck with no man, "not even a slow dance?" 
 You tried to kiss her and she even agrees 
 But that don't mean you 'bout to be Adam and Eve 
 In the Garden of Eden, but maybe for the evening 
 You say she leading you on, but you just added pressure 
 Of course she like you, you're friends don't try to test her 
 She says she likes you as a friend, not a lover or wife 
 So get a life, let her live hers and find another 
 Don't let her smash her ego, 'cause we know you're great 
 Let it be her mistake, yeah 
 Don't waste your time bro cause you know 
 If she don't appreciate what he do for her 
 Then tell me why he should wait around
