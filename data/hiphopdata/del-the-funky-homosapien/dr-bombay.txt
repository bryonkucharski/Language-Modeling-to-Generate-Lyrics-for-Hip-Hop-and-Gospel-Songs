Dr. Bombay, Dr. Bombay 
 Yo, we got a patient in the front 
 That's ah... suffering from an oversized gluttius maximus 
 And she wanna know can you solve it... 
 Verse One: 
 Mistadobalina is a jack-ass, much like a donkey 
 And I'ma pin the tail on the funky 
 Has anybody seen Del? Head swelled 
 'Cause I get paid well, kickin much tail 
 Drink me a forty as I ride my rhinoceros 
 You don't like it? Well you gots to kiss 
 Where the sun don't shine, something like my behind 
 I lose a fan but I'ma be fine 
 Dr. Feelgood, didn't think I still could 
 Make it funky real good 
 Take it then I looped it 
 Make you say -- GLORYHALLASTUPID! 
 The Motorbooty make you shake your rump 
 To the brand new D-Funk 
 Take a chunk 'cause I'm much like a hunk 
 To the dark skinned girls with funk in they trunk 
 Coming from around the way 
 It's Del better known as Dr. Bombay 
 Dr. Bombay 
 He don't stop and he don't play 
 Everytime I try to catch him he's always running away 
 (Sing it, sing it, sing it) 
 Dr. Bombay 
 Could you find time and could you stay 
 Cause the funk is guaranteed to make my day 
 (It's, so, funky!) 
 Verse Two: 
 Large as a black woman's gluttius maximus 
 And the question everybody's asking us 
 "Where'd you get your funk from" 
 A brother named George and some 151's 
 So Let's Take It To the Stage you suckers 
 I jam, and Mistadobalina eats smut 
 Back in the house with the crew Hieroglyphic 
 Now you know everything is terrific 
 Funk in the 1990's that's ironic 
 So grab you a sack of that chronic 
 Down with Da Lench Mob straight from the ghetto 
 But I'm under the sun in the meadow 
 Me and Miss Amazon sittin' on my lap 
 Butt so big when she walk it clap 
 Doin' the hoochie coochie in the forest 
 Y'all know who I am so girls sing the chorus 
 Dr. Bombay 
 He don't stop and he don't play 
 Everytime I try to catch him he's always running away 
 (Has anybody seen that...) 
 Dr. Bombay 
 Could you find time and could you stay 
 Cause the funk is guaranteed to make my day 
 (Sing it, sing it, sing it) 
 Dr. Bombay 
 He don't stop and he don't play 
 Everytime I try to catch him he's always running away 
 (Dr. Bombay) 
 Verse Three: 
 Watch your watch, 'cause if your spouse calls 
 Del's gonna damn sure make a house call (hello?) 
 You peeped out my drawers on your fence 
 I'm a dog, so you might see paw prints (woof) 
 (Whattup Doc?) Wait, it ain't cool to jock 
 'Cause you're real far from a ballerina 
 So oh oh, Mistadobalina 
 Freeze, and get up off your knees 
 Everything that Dr. Bombay say 
 Is guaranteed to make your day 
 So OOPS upside your head 
 I like Club Med hangin' out with the dreads 
 And girl if you ain't got a germ 
 I won't hesitate to pull out my Funky Worm 
 But if you ain't down with Del funk 
 Cancel your appointment and please get the hell on (see-ya!) 
 'Cause I won't have fraudulent foes 
 Under my nose, if you won't eighty-six the clothes 
 Get out the way, so I can save the day 
 'Cause I'm Dr. Bombay 
 Dr. Bombay 
 He don't stop and he don't play 
 Everytime I try to catch him he's always running away 
 (Peace to the Boogiemen) 
 Dr. Bombay 
 Could you find time and could you stay 
 Cause the funk is guaranteed to make my day 
 (I hate having to wait) 
 Dr. Bombay 
 He don't stop and he don't play 
 Everytime I try to catch him he's always running away 
 (D-E-L and Hieroglyphics, hahahahaha) 
 Dr. Bombay 
 Could you find time and could you stay 
 Cause the funk is guaranteed to make my day 
 Dr. Bombay 
 He don't stop and he don't play 
 Everytime I try to catch him he's always running away 
 Dr. Bombay 
 Could you find time and could you stay 
 Cause the funk is guaranteed to make my day
