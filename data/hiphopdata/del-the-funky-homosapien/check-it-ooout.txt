When it's time for me to recline 
 I listen to rhymes and beats in the waves of the spine, 
 To the brain 
 Relievin' pain and anguish 
 The stangest arrays make me sway and make my day brighta 
 The hip hop envia. 
 Write arrive a little soona 
 Check the soles on my Pumas 
 My attitude is miserable 
 Cause in my mind I'm sayin' here's a fool I don't like 
 I won't strike his ass in the face 
 I'm blastin' the bass in my headphones 
 A fool don't have to get his head flown 
 Why waste time with rhymes? 
 I get straight to the point 
 Like I HATE when funk's in the joint 
 The hip hop is playin' 
 Sprintin' in to spray men 
 Don't threaten me 
 Or you won't be able to see 
 When I gouge ya eyes out 
 I despise doubt 
 On your part 
 Like I won't stab you in your heart 
 My flow is drastic 
 Serious, sarcastic 
 My motto is, 
 "Phuck with me and get your ass kicked." 
 And that's the key to understandin' me 
 And if they cool then the foot is what you'll be brandin', B 
 Yeah... 
 "Check It ooooout!" (Repeat) 
 I love to peep a rhyme 
 First of all I'm seein' if my man can keep the time 
 If he go off beat, and it's on purpose 
 He gotta come back on the beat 
 Or the effort is worthless 
 I like ot hear a cool flow 
 But if it's identical to another, he a fool for it 
 Ya gotta build, 
 Upon skills 
 And all that copy that most popular rapper shit can get killed 
 I like a nigga who is quick witted 
 Cause it make me feel like I do, when I come from where my dick splitted 
 And I admit it, it's a joy 
 When I hear a nigga avoid the wack and make 'em paranoid 
 I loves niggas who talk shit 
 Cause that's my department 
 I got somethin' for anyone who starts shit 
 'Cause I'm relentless 
 With a sentence 
 A jail sentence, after I beat you senseless 
 I like niggas when they add rhymes, mad rhymes 
 Then I laugh at niggas who fell off and had rhymes 
 Just some descriptions of what I like to listen to 
 With my Bruce Banner scanner point of view... ('Pe-urnnnn') 
 Now I'm bout to clown a bitch 
 She made my eyebrows twitch 
 'Cause she's rich 
 Yeah, real funny 
 She makes some money 
 For puttin' other niggas down 
 You nothin' but a clown 
 You can't write 
 And you're not bright 
 You fail to notice the dopeness 
 Cause you have no insight 
 You need to quit 
 You ain't shit 
 You need to get a lesson, in hip hop detection 
 And you're next in my list to jack 
 It's a fact not fiction 
 Bitch, stop ya bitchin' 
 You write articles 
 I'ma rip apart ya skull 
 Cause ya dull 
 Not entertainin' 
 I'ma put ya brain in orbit 
 'Cause I'm morbid 
 Thinkin' a new ways to kill ya 
 And yo, 
 I feel ya 
 Ya too critical 
 And ain't got a bit a pull 
 Just admit it fool 
 Before we get rid of you 
 A rolling stone gathers no moss 
 And now who will pay the cost 
 And afterwards get lost 
 Hit the dirt, before you get hurt 
 I eat stupid bitches like you and a rhyme for dessert 
 I bet you never get no dick 
 You make me so sick 
 So my pistol is loaded...
