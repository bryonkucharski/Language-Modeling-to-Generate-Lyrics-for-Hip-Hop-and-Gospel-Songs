Del: 
 Mista, twista, get ya 
 Every single time 
 And I rhyme like I know 
 So I flow 
 With tha gifted tongue, 
 An encryptic brung 
 New phrases into the mazes 
 Play this 
 Two times a day with a dayo 
 Day, eh eh yo and the daylight come 
 I plum forgot what a wack rhyme was 
 Because I buzz like a bee 
 In the ears of my peers 
 So they know and I know 
 We all know dayo- 
 Day light come and me wanna go home- 
 Cool 
 No tool 
 No Smith and Wesson 
 Just an opposite 
 So I can pop a bit 
 Of shit on the mic when I get on the mic 
 "P-p-p-p-ping!" 
 I ricochet a bit on the mic 
 And I like it- 
 Just like the Gulf or World War II 
 D-E-L will C-R-U and sage anyone who 
 Makes advances when I'm incognito gweedo 
 Is the answer when I prance up on ya skull like a frito 
 Finito 
 But I ain't finished 
 Till I let the flip side ride 
 Till the rhythm is diminished 
 Casual: 
 I would if I could 
 But I ain't 'cause I cain't 
 Time for me to lay down the law 
 Who's raw? 
 You saw the blues from the shoes of the writer 
 Stronger than a cisco 
 In ya like a cider 
 Watery- 
 Try to win the lottery before you try to slaughter me 
 Because I'm not the G 
 To be stepped to 
 Kept you 
 On ya tons 
 As my rep grew 
 I let through 
 Negative foes 
 So you better get flows to counteract what we've done 
 Proceed one good 
 'Cause I'm armed like a sleeve son 
 Plead dumb and step back 
 As I rep 
 Shop collect 
 Respect drops 
 In debt the next prop 
 -Artist 
 The hardest is the one who don't pass out 
 If Tyson's last name were Aphone I'd knock his ass out 
 The bigger the better 
 The better the bigger is 
 Whenever you figure this 
 N*gga is gettin' his 
 Be real and don't kill with flaws the ill cause 
 Is answer to the gods 
 And that's when you lost 
 Keep on losing, 
 Amusing many tactics 
 I came to earn more green than Saint Patrick 
 And I make backs if you get caught frontin' 
 Never bought a Newport but I puff a blunt'n 
 Tajai: 
 I needs no sugar crisp 
 To get swift 
 So what with two syllables exemplifies the gift 
 Tajai 
 I sense those that try to feel my ladders 
 Bladders release upon your porch if you don't cease 
 I respond with minimal distraction 
 When I see one 
 Fatter than re-run 
 So what's happennin'? 
 It's not where you from, 
 It's just how you come 
 Correct 
 Respect the rough neck 
 Is not gettin' bucked 
 And tucked into their beds like nighty nighty 
 Theft of the membrane 
 None left 'cause I'm a righty 
 Fight these- 
 You'll catch vollies for your follies 
 And mistakes 
 I stick fakes wit shanks 
 So no thanks 
 Wack shit 
 Your attemps to rap are innaffectual 
 Like gettin' butt styles 
 Like the heart of homosexual 
 Not for sex 
 When you rap the intersection 
 Of damage 
 Sandwiched knuckles 
 And what your luck pulls 
 Bad ones 
 Catch one or two 
 Rather a view 
 A slew for soft ass phonies 
 Bust your cronies 
 Try me, 
 You'll catch my Vans in your hinee 
 That's if my backgrip slips 
 Though I doubt it 
 Pout if you want to 
 Convert me to filey 
 But I seize more than them candies 
 Nothing gets by me 
 So play the tracks 
 And you'll go out like "later max" 
 Next to Tajai 'cause I kicks the greater stacks. 
 Opio 
 Ske-beep-boom 
 Bob your head to this 
 Mischievous 
 Soul socidle, 
 Idle chatter never slips 
 Off the lips 
 Of this writer 
 Might not be a greater innovater of the rhyme scheme 
 My style is the visine 
 To get your eyes opening 
 This raggedy andy gets dandy like a lion in the meadow 
 While the teapots blow off steam like a kettle 
 You hip to the hop 
 I kick 
 I trip the life fantastic 
 Gettin' into the grooves that'll bend the phonographics 
 The vandal with the vocals 
 Making the locals go insane 
 The regal rhymer speeks substinance for the brain 
 Get frisky with the phrases as you praise this life divinity 
 The one of liberated soul 
 Controls for infinity 
 Got styles by the square mile 
 Cat's got a frightened child 
 Hieroglyphics will uplift the rhythms for the meanwhile 
 Articulate my lingo as I mingle in my medium of speech 
 And peace to pop prophets as I piner and teach 
 A smidgen of religion to the fraudulent 
 Listen, 
 Pay attention 
 I'm the master of this convention 
 Kick the wickity wiley stylee 
 While you sutterin' just like smilee 
 Skippin shingles of your shattered dreams 
 Too bad it seems you try me 
 The wise and wordy wizard 
 Pays a visit 
 To your subconscience 
 Quest to run the land 
 Distinguish all the nonsense 
 Optimistic, stylistic, mystic myth 
 I'm swift like Mercury 
 Mercy me 
 I surely shoot the gift 
 A-Plus 
 People call me soup just because I'm livin' fat 
 People call me nasty: it's because I eat the cat 
 And I swing a bat to level heads, 
 Leaving devils dead 
 Never said never 
 Cause of clever heads 
 Better dreadlocks 
 On the top of my crop, 
 Never flaky 
 If this was a field then Bo Jackson couldn't shake me 
 Bake me 
 Betty Crocker's oven isn't hot enough 
 If you wanna spread the skins 
 Then I got alot of stuff 
 Not a bluff 
 Not a tough guy 
 Thinkin' twice 
 Why step? 
 Here's a fly rep 
 I kept my step ladder 
 I had a fatter spliff I was hittin' on 
 Now it's just a smidgen like a pidgeon I be shittin' on 
 Sittin' on a futon... 
 Slippin' lots of boots on 
 I'm the type of brotha that ya have to get ya troops on 
 Oops I'm sorry 'cause I didn't mean to dis you 
 I could hook a hoe and make her blow like I was tissue 
 Mary had a little lamb, 
 Adam got a lot of dough 
 Need help with your garden? 
 Scholar got a lotta hoes 
 Yo-I didn't mean hoes, 
 Yo I meant women 
 If she got the pool, I got the trunks 
 Let's go swimming 
 Dip dip dive 
 'Cause I'm live 
 Liver then 
 Five or ten 
 Of the men 
 On my jock 
 You don't stop 
 Here a pimp 
 There a pimp 
 Everywhere a pimp pimp 
 This A-plus grades the quiz- 
 So there it is.
