My time is short, my thoughts are lazer 
 Precise and accurate master any phase of 
 Modern technology, concerning audio fidelity 
 Finally settling you meddling foes who ain't never in vogue 
 You just better let go before I get in your dome 
 And just set up a home to rest 
 DZL, he only promote the best 
 Lockin' up to blow the set 
 Sky high, nice try, nigga 
 I roll with vets who never stray away 
 From the flavor, taste some 
 Oopsie, I threw in some razor blades, ace of spades 
 I lay naysayers to waste 
 Prey for grace but act like you want it first 
 'Cause see me, I'm not at all concerned 
 Really though you need a hearing aid 
 'Cause you don't hear me though 
 Slap you in your earlobe 
 With funk till you fear it though 
 My time, priceless, my rhyme, niceness 
 I got something for you and I think you gone like it 
 Funk in the fashion, something to blast 
 In your vast envelope of space and keep a hold of the faith 
 Build strength to hold the weight 
 You go against the grain, you get told to your face 
 Like, eh, dude, I ain't here to grade you 
 But you way due for a learnin' 
 Once I drip some funk in your ear 
 You gone feel that burnin' in your sternum 
 That's how you know, you ain't fast, you slow 
 Gimme that, you can't have it no more 
 You just a victim of circumstance, so fuckin' what? 
 Everybody got the same story, it's classical 
 That's the whole balance of the challenge of gettin' there 
 First you gotta get by the status quo 
 Assholes with nothin' to do but fuckin' with you 
 My time is spent on comin' up 
 With a new way to touch on the truth 
 Trust in the Lord who dominate over 
 More than your millions afford 
 All aboard, you comin' whether you wanna or not 
 And it's gonna get hot, I saved you a spot 
 Funk in the first degree on me, have a big helpin' 
 If you repel it then you start meltin' 
 'Cause you all jealous 
 Greedy fuckin' car dealers 
 A big hoax, no, I don't feel you folks 
 But I smell you just the same 
 Nothing's changed, you play games 
 But your stench I can pick up a mile away 
 I'm stylin' on fakes who imitate to get a plate 
 But as you can see you ain't finer 
 Get a taste of nothin' but the funk, so say your grace 
 As I invade your space and gauge your weight 
 I'm real heavy, feel every, nerve ending, bending 
 Antennas up and catchin' what you sendin' 
 Focus my attention on gettin' it and keepin' it 
 Defeat the stress with some funk to digest 
 Conductin' dialect, just like a symphony 
 Pimp epiphany when hoes try to trick on me 
 Ce la vie, they gone be all they can be 
 Banshees that keep me on my toes, dancing 
 And I'm light on my feet, Bigfoot, quick and nimble 
 Your head is thick, you simple 
 You know who I'm talkin' to, all of you 
 Ain't nothing wrong, just stay cool 
 This only phase two of everybody 
 Play the fool, your move, fool 
 And hurry up, I ain't got all day 
 And you gotta move now, you playin' the game 
 You stay in the game, Jack 
 Bitch out now and you get sent back 
 And you miss a turn, now you get to sit and burn 
 Now you really hot 
 My time, priceless, my rhyme, niceness 
 I got something for you and I think you gone like it 
 Funk in the fashion, something to blast 
 In your vast envelope of space and keep a hold of the faith 
 Build strength to hold the weight 
 You go against the grain, you get told to your face 
 My time, priceless, my rhyme, niceness 
 I got something for you and I think you gone like it 
 Funk in the fashion, something to blast 
 In your vast envelope of space, keep a hold of the faith 
 Build strength to hold the weight 
 You go against the grain, you get told to your face 
 Told to your face 
 And I'm light on my feet, Bigfoot
