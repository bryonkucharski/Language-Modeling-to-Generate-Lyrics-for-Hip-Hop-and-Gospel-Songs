Yo its three thousand thirty 
 I want y'all to meet Deltron Zero, hero, not no small feat 
 It's all heat in this day and age 
 I rage your grave, anything it takes to save the day 
 Neuromancer, perfect blend of technology and magic 
 Use my rappin' so you all could see the hazards 
 Plus entertainment where many are brainless 
 We cultivated the lost art of study and I brought a buddy 
 Automator harder slayer fascinating combinations 
 Cyber warlords are activating abominations 
 Arm a nation with hatred we ain't with that 
 We high-tech archeologists searching for nicknacks 
 Composing musical stimpacks that impacts the song 
 Crack the motor what you think you rappin' for? 
 I used to be a mech soldier but I didn't respect orders 
 I had to step forward, tell them this ain't for us 
 Living in a post-apocalyptic world morbid and horrid 
 The secrets of the past they hoarded 
 Now we just boarded on a futuristic spacecraft 
 No mistakes black it's our music we must take back 
 Yo it's three thousand thirty 
 I want y'all to meet Deltron Zero, and Automator 
 Yo it's three thousand thirty 
 I want y'all to meet Deltron Zero, and Automator 
 Yo it's three thousand thirty 
 I want y'all to meet Deltron Zero, and Automator 
 Del I'm feeling like a ghost in a shell 
 I wrote this in jail playing host to a cell 
 For the pure verbal, they said my sentence was equivalent to murder 
 Kust another hurdle, I bounced through a portal 
 I knew they had the mindstate of mere mortals 
 My ears morphed to receptors to catch ya 
 Every word about gravity control 
 And the families they hold for handsome ransoms 
 On the run with a handgun, blast bioforms; I am warned 
 That a planet-wise manhunt with cannons 
 Will make me, abandon, my foolish plan of uprisin 
 Fuck dyin', I hijack a mech 
 Controllin with my magical chance so battle advance 
 Through centuries of hip-hop legacy, megaspeed 
 Hyperwarp to Automator's crib and light the torch 
 They can't fight the force 
 Victory is ours once we strike the source 
 Enterprisin wise men look to the horizon 
 Thinkin' more capitalism is the wisdom 
 And imprison, all citizens empowered with rhythm 
 We keep the funk alive by talking with idioms 
 Yo it's three thousand thirty 
 I want y'all to meet Deltron Zero, and Automator 
 Yo it's three thousand thirty 
 I want y'all to meet Deltron Zero, and Automator 
 Yo it's three thousand thirty 
 I want y'all to meet Deltron Zero, and Automator 
 Isn't eternal evil concerned with thievery 
 Medieval prehistoric rhetoric well we ahead of that 
 Lay it down with soundwaves that pound pavement 
 Original minstrals my central processing unit 
 Is in tune with my heart for this art 
 Not artificial cause that makes it hard to miss you 
 Copycats finish last in the human race 
 Staying glued to safes too prude to take a buddha break 
 We got espers that let us bless with fresh shit 
 Undetected by yes men questing for five fleeting nanoseconds of fame 
 Protecting the brain from conspiracies against my cosmos 
 While I float to Neo-Tokyo with Opio 
 Or discuss combusitible rust clusters with Plus 
 Evade cyber police in a computer crib confuse the kids 
 But I can make a kickin rhymes that's sacred 
 Telepathic mind that takes its greatness from the Matrix 
 Esper rhyme professor rushes in ultra pressures 
 With correction measures 
 Why half the world's a desert 
 Cannibals eat human brains for dessert 
 Buried under deap dirt, mobility innert 
 I insert these codes for the cataclysm 
 Ever since I had the vision use my magnetism 
 In this modern metropolis they tries to lock us up 
 Under preposterous laws that's not for us 
 Yo it's three thousand thirty 
 I want y'all to meet Deltron Zero, and Automator 
 Yo it's three thousand thirty 
 I want y'all to meet Deltron Zero, and Automator 
 Yo it's three thousand thirty 
 I want y'all to meet Deltron Zero, and Automator
