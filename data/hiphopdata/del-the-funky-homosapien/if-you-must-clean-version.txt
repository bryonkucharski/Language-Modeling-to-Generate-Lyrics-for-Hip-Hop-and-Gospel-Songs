It's important to practice good hygiene, 
 At least if you want to run with my team. 
 I'm 'bout to get into some shit that I've seen. 
 This fool's breath forments so bad it'll melt your ice cream. 
 They say don't say nothing if you can't say nice things 
 Sittin' too close and hear my boy like my eye sting 
 I tired to be subtle, hand him a stick of gum 
 I was a victim of breath on the 
 Running his yap about what sets he from 
 Gotta get some gum, gotta gets him some 
 He turned it down, his teeth was brown 
 Excruciating, boring, it was a new sensation 
 I had to ask the dope to pass the soap 
 'Cause his toe had the stench of crustaceans 
 Or bathrooms in the bus station 
 He had a can of oh he had some raisins 
 Amazin' 
 Head to toe BO, he didn't know 
 Used to the fragrance 
 Just as the days went without bathin' 
 He felt manly and not like a maiden 
 He had one dread and fungus 
 Said he worked on people's toilets with plungers 
 Girls thought the guy (music change) we were with the tongue, yo 
 So guys take your queue from this little number 
 You gotta wash your *ss, if you must 
 You gotta wash your hair, if you must 
 You gotta brush your teeth, if you must 
 Or else you'll be funk-ay 
 To wash up 
 You gotta wash your *ss, if you must 
 You gotta wash your hair, if you must 
 You gotta brush your teeth, if you must 
 Or else you'll be funk-ay 
 To wash up 
 To, to, to wash up 
 To, to, to, to wash up 
 To, to, to wash up 
 To, to, to, to wash up 
 Now in class you need total concentration, 
 But there's kids in the back holding conversations 
 Crackin' on each other and neither were poster boys 
 Both of 'em smelled like the type that soap avoid 
 Coast enjoyed a leave of absence 
 One fool's feet smelled like it struck some matchsticks 
 Brimstone 
 Girls would never bring him home 
 I was laughin' and his friend raised his tone and said: 
 (Different voice) Bud, you rolled all over yourself 
 Yeah, I know some people 'n' your *ss would be submerged 
 Like you need to do in water 'cause you smell like a turd 
 Want a cap, get some courage your feet smell lurid 
 But look it up and while you at it get a cup 
 And squeeze the sweat out your sweatshirt and drink it or gargle 
 You get our vote for most stinkiest 
 That n*gga started thinking the shit 
 Said I was frail, I said he was stale 
 Under arms is right, undergarments might 
 'Bout the leap out your holy sweats 
 Then we hold him messin' after this I'm gonna collect 
 N*gga check yourself, respect yourself 
 And watch your motherfuckin' body 'fore your sweatshirt melt 
 And ready your act of no lady find you attractive 
 The funk got you captive 
 You don't need a map, bitch 
 You gotta wash your *ss, if you must 
 You gotta wash your hair, if you must 
 You gotta brush your teeth, if you must 
 Or else you'll be funk-ay 
 To wash up 
 You gotta wash your *ss, if you must 
 You gotta wash your hair, if you must 
 You gotta brush your teeth, if you must 
 Or else you'll be funk-ay 
 To wash up 
 To, to wash up 
 To, to, to wash up 
 To, to, to, to wash up 
 To, to, to wash up 
 I'll have some, have some soap for my face 
 A- a- have some soap for my face 
 A- a- a- a- have some soap for my face 
 A- a- have some soap for my face (fade until song ends)
