Yo, young adrenaline, Del, he a veteran 
 Son, I remember him, yeah, he the medicine 
 But he don't heal 'em, his funk put an end to it 
 Personal prescription is poisonous and venomous 
 Young adrenaline, D-E-L, you did it again, you did it again 
 Yo, peep the transition from here to there 
 Man, you understand pimpin' shit's different 
 Now peep the conversation between me and you 
 And about clockin' paper which means 
 Makin' one worthy of the cream 'cause nobody passin' it out 
 'Fore elastic came out 
 Yeah, your ass is out, if you don't dig 
 Concentrate the effort 'cause the shit's big 
 You won't live very long fuckin' around 
 There's somethin' about puttin' my foot in front of the other 
 Start struttin', I'm mean with it, lean with it 
 Like I'm really something to see 
 I smell bad, yeah, the funk is on me and you gon' to get some 
 Keep up the friction 
 'Til a spark lights dry grass and fry yo ass, fire sign DZL, Leo 
 Some say I'm egotistical but that's 'cause they below 
 Here, throw on these spectacles and see what D know 
 Peep why my concentration deep like Preemo 
 Don't get mad 'cause you missed the bus 
 Blame it on luck and miss the next one pulling up 
 Hopefully, you will utilize it 
 Knowledge, groundbreaking thoughts I process 
 Get me outta nonsense, leavin' most foxes astonished 
 I'll box with the Ebonics 
 Talk like weed and chronic if it had human capabilities 
 I break it down like segments on a centipede 
 I'mma blowin' steam and diggin' the scene 
 D, he know these things, he like to roll with kings 
 And crusaders who probably stole your rings 
 Slid them off your fingertips 
 That's how it will go on the low, you never know 
 So flossin' is just not a option 
 Don't even wanna or feel the need to parade 
 What I made in front of the people who made me DZL 
 And you know if you fake, they gonna see you 
 In a minute though, I got an endless flow 
 Pinned up on the wall like centerfolds 
 I sit enclosed 
 In a sound lab with profound task I undergo 
 'Cause I'm coming close to the knowledge I need 
 To get on some next shit and now I gotta lead 
 And take work, damn it, I know it all seems hella easy and fun 
 But those be the wack ones 
 See some action for years, they maybe crackin' 
 Poppin', but they don't last too often 
 Longevity means you survive 
 Short sightedness ain't insured for the flight 
 Secruity tight, he gotta stay on the ground 
 He hatin' like a child but I'm on my way now 
 Fuck 'em, let the motherfucka hop Greyhound 
 Maybe he can hang around the rim for a rebound 
 Can't even see style, much too forward 
 Plus too boring for a feeble mind dormant 
 Evil, I know it but, shit, it's kind of funny though 
 Motherfuckas laugh at my expense on another show 
 Or another channel but I control this 
 Particular network with a different direction 
 You alive but not actively growing 
 So insulting me, the impact below 3 
 Negative 26, the funniest shit 'cause I'm real with it 
 Tellin' you there's money to get 
 Keep running your lips 
 You gonna see it's comin' up in a bit 
 Hold up, hold up 
 Hey Del 
 What's up? 
 Yeah, you're just like sand, man, I knew it, man, what's happening? 
 I have a feelin' you'll be slidin' back in 
 My man, you back on the scene, never lack esteem 
 That's what I mean 
 My man, yeah, introduce yourself to these suckers drivin' around 
 So that they pay more attention to you 
 Opportunity is my name 
 Pursuin' me should be your main game 
 You should stick to me, a well known operative 
 [Incomprehensible], it's all good though 
 There's so many possibilities that come to me 
 Shit 
 I figure why not peel off some for free? 
 But, Big, I don't hang around, you understand that? 
 I just came to town for a minute 
 It was a favorable time, I admit it 
 But when I gotta split, I gotta split 
 This might be your only chance, you get? 
 I know you think I'm blowin' smoke up yo ass 
 But you broke, I got pockets overflowin' with cash 
 If you diggin' yourself like you seem to be, ah, diggin' mine for cash 
 You are, you know you gotta a shot at makin' the moment last 
 So let's see if you dig right here, right now, I got a new lease 
 Yeah, that's what you need, you know what you need though 
 Keep on jivin', I gotta split, man 
 But young DZL, I'mma catch you later, aight? 
 Bye, bye, man 
 Keep it real, man 
 Keep it real, real, man
