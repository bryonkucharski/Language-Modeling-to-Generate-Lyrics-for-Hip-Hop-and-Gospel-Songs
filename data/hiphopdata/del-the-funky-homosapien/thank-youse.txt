It's time for me 
 I never rhyme for free 
 At least pay attention 
 You know, let your mind be free 
 I think by now everyone knows 
 My funk flows will ease the pain 
 Because MCs we brain 
 Make 'em nervous 
 Here for your service 
 Infer this 
 Clear to any rapper that is wacka 
 I'll slap ya 
 I talk shit that's amazin' 
 The days spent 
 Inside my crib producin' had me boostin' my confidence 
 Now I will stomp some sense 
 Into those numbskulls 
 I leave 'em dumb-dull 
 I thank you the listener 
 'Cause if it was up to me 
 If y'all was girls 
 I'd be kissin' ya 
 And the brothers get phat pounds 
 And goin' round is phat pounds of indo 
 No brown 
 I puff sess at the rest 
 Unless they have the bomb beta 
 And now my mom made a turnaround 
 She wasn't concerned and clowned 
 Mostly, 
 Now I get ends and my job is not pretend, 
 "It doesn't phaze, I amaze wit my phrases, play this in your Jeep, so 
 Your neighbors lose some sleep (I wanna thank you)..." 
 I wanna thank you 
 Cause my dank grew and flourished 
 Nourished ny hunger 
 Sure, it's me indulgin' 
 Never will I bullshit some other finna frame 
 If you're a beginner here's my name 
 DeL! myster, ya shyster 
 I'll heist your jewels and tolls and leave ya fooled 
 Moot, 
 I never get soot 
 My ends that I got last year will probably still get resooped 
 I know y'allre sick'n tired of these weakassniggas makin' records 
 So just check what I delivers 
 I send shivers down ya spine 
 I'm incline to bind and put together clever conversation 
 'Cause I'm dope without the leather 
 Whether or not, my spot is never taken 
 Or forever breakin' on new rhymers 
 They flock around, wanna be down and two timers 
 I will design a flow that will remind ya 
 Dumbasshoes and a path go 
 Go to a spot where I know that the grass's sold, 
 "I love to roll a fat stogie, if you're out there you can roll one too, 
 And listen only (I wanna thank you, peace)...
