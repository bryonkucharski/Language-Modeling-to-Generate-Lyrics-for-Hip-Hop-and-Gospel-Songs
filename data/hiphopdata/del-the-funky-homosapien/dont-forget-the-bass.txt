I'm ready for action, packing provisions of visions 
 Verbally, every word will be enhanced 
 With the bass that'll put you in a trance 
 Some dance, come take a chance 
 Del won't do you wrong 
 I've been in the rap game too long to falter 
 I rock like Gibraltar 
 Make you kneel to the butt like an altar 
 We move to prove that this is improved, when you're at-water 
 Caught 'em with vibration that soothes your back like massages 
 Before you can park your car in garages 
 It'll be just for riders, listening to 'ROCK THE BELLS' 
 You can barely hear the vocals 
 Mixing is important, getting the public into chokeholds 
 Hip hop homo's will do well to know this 
 It ain't about who's the dopest 
 It's who gets the fan's focus upon you 
 When they feel what the song do 
 I think I'm onto something, when I got my shit pumping 
 I remember, when they were satisfied with just lyrics 
 Now, if the music 's flat 
 I can barely stand to hear it 
 And my rhymes are impeccable and you can't dissect my flow 
 With music sounding like it's out of tin cans 
 Just wretch the whole vibe and stride for perfection 
 Why you think they call this a profession? Hey 
 (Chorus: repeat 2X) 
 Can't forget the bass, the bottom got 'em crawling to the wall man 
 We got cassettes, CD's and LP's 
 DJ's for days, whatever you do 
 Give it your all, cause that's what pays 
 I just love when I can hear the bump pleading to the walls 
 In the halls, coming from the record stores in the malls 
 A beat with walls I like that 
 It bites back and strikes back 
 At niggaz who are wack, 'cause 
 Back in the day when hip hop was just developing 
 It was back in the day 
 We should be relishing in experience 
 All you newcomers better be leery cause 
 Hieroglyphics got the bump 
 And it ain't mysterious 
 This don't apply to the niggaz who salved 
 And fell out of their fan base 
 Trying to chase the big bucks 
 It sucks, I know, when your heroes wanna appear to hos 
 Supermacho! And watch the whole role and image of a mic champion 
 To the fan base it simply can't be done 
 'Cause they're your folks when you don't get the pop shit 
 They know you got the top shit and in ain't only for profit 
 But since we on the topic, let me drop it 
 We need to stop this segregation of hip hop 
 Talking 'bout fuck the east coast, and fuck the west 
 He's sold out, cause someone either sings or toast in the chorus 
 What is real hip hop then? Only the shit you listen to, 
 Everything else pretending? I'm sending a message to my fan base 
 Fuck this is hip hop and this is rap, it came from the same place 
 And there's a place for everything including hieroglyphics 
 And we gonna come with it, as long as y'all with it 
 Cause the fam base is like a legion 
 For one cause, we want the dope shit cause 
 The other got flossed ??? Now 
 I'm a fan who likes a lot of different things 
 I differentiate with music just to spread my wings 
 I always do my best, that's why the fans love me 
 Not some crime shit, so I can be bubbly 
 We all got some preferences, that's just how it goes 
 But when you see there's an effort being made, don't turn up your nose 
 Turn up the bass, race to go and buy it 
 And don't dub it, some of y'all do 
 Don't deny it
