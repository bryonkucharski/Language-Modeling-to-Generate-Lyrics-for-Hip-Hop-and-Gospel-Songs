The Falcon: "I don't know who that cat is, or why he's got a hate on for 
 Cap'; But I sure aim to 
 Find out!" 
 Villain: "So bird man! You sneak up from behind; Precisely the sort of 
 Tactics I should have 
 Expected from you." 
 The Falcon: "Save the conversation, for I am not behind you now, clay 
 Face!" 
 Villain: "Out of my way fool! This is good enough for you! And for 
 You..." 
 Del 
 Flexin' the futuristic style 
 That will devistate minds 
 As I find more elaborate metaphors 
 So meditate 
 Think for a second as I becken 
 Abstract thoughts brought to the surface 
 Watch as I burst this 
 Rhyme flow 
 I design slow moving tempos so the simple minded foes find my flows 
 Moving at the speed of light 
 I need a tight 
 Sample so I can dismantle your cranium 
 Play me dumb if you want imbecile 
 I can pick your brain 
 Like a grain of sand 
 In an hour glass when its filled 
 To capacity Cassidy 
 Hop-a-long to the song that is strong 
 I'm the massive bee 
 With a twelve foot stinger and I wring you're little wet towel 
 'Cause I'm getting foul when I'm meddled with 
 I settle this 
 Violence I silence 
 MC's who continue 
 When you know you will fail 
 Slow snail as I salt ya 
 Then watch ya shrivel up and sizzle 'cause I'm hard like Gilbralta 
 You're butter-soft so you can park it out ya little chauffeur 
 'Cause I go for the esaphogus when I choke ya 
 Broke ya skeletin ya fail again 
 And I'm the victa 
 You can pick the time and the place 
 So you can get a taste of medecin for your medulla 'cause I school a 
 Ferris Beulla cuttin' class cause your style is butt 'n' ass; 
 I pass one to A+ 
 And I say hush child 
 Cause your plush style 
 Is unstable as a slush pile 
 You ain't down with the program 
 You snow man 
 Me the Homosapien is funky like your toe jam 
 So damn enlightenin I'm frightenin allota men 
 Open up your shutters let the sunshine in 
 Simple Simon rhymin' on the airwaves 
 So scare slays to the rhythm 
 So I give 'em more than a fair trade 
 Verbal blades 
 Slice humans 
 To ribbons 'cause they're fibbin' so you'll be assumin' 
 That I'm the dopest 
 I focus on the vibes that I conjure 
 Clean up the stains in your brain when I launder 
 Now feast upon 
 The thoughts like a mental plum 
 Maybe you might learn something before I'm done 
 Spit out the pits and hit the flows in the nose 
 Del lets your sub-conscious be exposed 
 Where it like a bullet proof vest upon your chest 
 Even the best hollow tip bullet couldn't make an impression 
 Cause this lesson 
 Is invulnerable 
 Never dwell on the hellish aspects 
 Have fun until you perish 
 Cherish your lifetime 
 This is why I write rhymes 
 To illuminate the ones with the tight minds 
 Sign on the dotted line 
 Spottin fine shelter 
 Step to me wrong and I'ma belt ya 
 Eye for an Eye 
 But you're eye shouldn't cry over spilled milk 
 Feel guilt when you know you're wrong 
 Never sing the song like you know it better than anyone else's 
 Cause that's selfish 
 Learn to admit mistakes 
 Just sit and takes a load off your back 
 Don't this acoustic bass on this track 
 Pack a wallop 
 All up in your face 'cause I'm the bold kid 
 Check out the illogical styles that I molded 
 Silly-putty syllables 
 That still will pull uplifting 
 The masses the higher plateaus of hip-hop listening 
 Villain: "My red, white and blue foe- I have no desire to kill you, not 
 Now, not when I can make 
 You suffer all the more by slaying the one you call the Falcon." 
 Captain America: "No way to reach him in time." 
 Villain: "So watch, my friend. Watch and greive. Eh? My weapon's charge. 
 ... Exhausted??!"
