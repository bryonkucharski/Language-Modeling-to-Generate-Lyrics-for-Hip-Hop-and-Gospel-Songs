Yeah, I smell kinda good, I mean 
 (Incomprehensible) 
 You know I gotta take a whiff 
 Know I gotta take a whiff 
 I'm so tight, I'm so tight 
 I'm so tight, I'm so tight 
 I'm smellin' myself 
 I'm so tight, I'm so tight 
 I'm so tight 
 I'm smellin' myself 
 I'm so tight, I'm so tight 
 I'm so tight 
 I'm smellin' myself 
 I'm so tight, I'm so tight 
 I'm so tight 
 I'm 
 I'm checkin' under my underarms 
 Lemme take a good whiff, lemme see if I stank 
 I don't need deodorant 
 In the mode, I spit, I'm the global event 
 Told them this but they don't know when to quit 
 So I blow 'em to bits, smell 
 It's the African funk, fresh from the motherland 
 Better than the other brands on the other hand 
 You be the judge, tell me how you feel about it 
 I got a buzz, it is what it is and it do what it does 
 Because 
 I'm so tight, I'm so tight 
 I'm so tight, I'm so tight 
 I'm smellin' myself 
 I'm so tight, I'm so tight 
 I'm so tight 
 I'm smellin' myself 
 I'm so tight, I'm so tight 
 I'm so tight 
 I'm smellin' myself 
 I'm so tight, I'm so tight 
 I'm so tight 
 I'm 
 The funky homosapien is a new species 
 He is the shit, at least he's the feces 
 Completely in tune, you can't eat me, yeah 
 The funky homosapien is a new species 
 He is the shit, at least he's the feces 
 Completely in tune, you can't eat me, yeah 
 I know I stank, I'm better than you 
 Oh, no, you ain't, I'mma show you, you ain't 
 No, you ain't, shut up 
 D, please tell me the reason why 
 You know I can't even lie, I gotta habit, I need my fix 
 Please assist me in this mix up, please, please 
 Okay, slow down, start from the beginning 
 Well, Del, I know you been peeping game and how it unfold 
 You understand how this dumb old record industry 
 Pimp artists for platinum 
 They don't want gold, so continue 
 Well, we the listeners feel 
 That this shit is really outta bounds 
 How that sound? They think we sheep 
 And put out the weakest mothersuckers with a beat 
 I smell, I peep, okay, I'm findin' for the crack 
 You need to bring it back 
 It's good as done, stick your nose in this 
 No, Holmes, go ahead, get a bigger whiff 
 Damn, that's ridiculous 
 What kind is that? I call it primal rap 
 Take the funk then apply it to tracks 
 Not like these hip hop versions of Spinal Tap 
 They caricatures, beware of the curse, what curse? 
 Man you know the spell that they put you under 
 You won't be able to smell, it's sorta like sportin' a halo in hell 
 Feelin' out of place and your halo melt 
 You can cop some of this while they on sale 
 Directly from me, not Rapidshare links 
 Funk is everywhere but this is a rare thing 
 Okay, that's what's up, I'm 'bout to tell fools 
 Nobody do it like Del do 
 What's that? 
 Nobody do it like Del do 
 Nobody do it like Del do 
 I need a hearing aid 
 Nobody do it like Del do 
 I need a hearing aid 
 Nobody do it like Del do 
 I need a hearing aid 
 Nobody do it like Del do 
 I need a hearing aid 
 Nobody do it like Del do 
 I need a hearing aid 
 Nobody do it like Del do 
 What you say? 
 What you say? 
 I'm so tight, I'm so tight 
 I'm so tight, I'm so tight 
 I'm smellin' myself 
 I'm so tight, I'm so tight 
 I'm so tight 
 You're smellin' yourself 
 I get down so far that I'm musty and funky 
 And that's good luck that'll come my way 
 So don't trip while I take a whiff and get 
 High off my own supply 
 Oops, I went against rule number one 
 But if I'm the dope in question I know 
 When to measure out the accurate dosage of flows 
 To kick so none of these posers get their chosen pick 
 I walk around with a odor and scent 
 Let the funk ferment, so burn the incense 
 But it doesn't matter if you can't stand it 
 Funk spread all over the planet expanding 
 Make the globe move 'cause you know you gotta hustle 
 Life is too funky to fake it, hustle 
 Gotta put twice the effort just to make it, hustle 
 People want the real, no imitation 
 And most you cats is mediocre 
 Your raps be insulting the culture 
 And where do we go from here? 
 Follow your nose because the nose always knows 
 Follow your nose because the nose always knows 
 Follow your nose because the nose always knows
