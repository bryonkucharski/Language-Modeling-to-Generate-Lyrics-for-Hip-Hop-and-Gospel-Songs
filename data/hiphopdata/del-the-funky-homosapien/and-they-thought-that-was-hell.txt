Hip hop, an asylum 
 Run by inmates, who be wilin' 
 So I'm comin' with a heavier dose 
 This medication is safe for you slowpokes 
 Don't choke, just swallow it, follow it 
 With this funk flow poured from the bottle, kid 
 Some of y'all don't mind if you die in the spotlight 
 Long as you shine you be crossing the line 
 And you out of your mind 
 They very own personal Dr. Frankenstien 
 And the monster is right in front of your face 
 You can't figure it out, you figure it's me 
 'Cause I stay way ahead of you dweebs 
 My regiment be the strictest rituals 
 Habitual funk for competition, it's critical 
 Get exposed in the expose 
 Soon as you step on stage, get fragged with grenades 
 Average a day of raps per capita 
 Slappin ya, you just a passenger that be tagging along 
 You averagin' on some other shit you think is nice 
 Well think twice 
 Life is too short to be a shorty 
 Is the story of the glorious trail 
 The metamorphosis of Del 
 Livin' large, the niggaz in charge of the game 
 Like a caretaker, a shareholder with a rare aura 
 Everybody think they hip connected 
 Through the world-wide web with microchips 
 Cellphones radiate the mic I spit into 
 Sending feedback so please just leave that 
 Thing where you came from 
 I'm-a leave your brain numb 
 You ain't gonna need it after feeling the invasion 
 Ceiling's gonna cave in 
 Vibrations bounce and drill into the pavement 
 I'm thrilling you with entertainment 
 Yo, I never gave anybody hell 
 I just told them what's up 
 And they thought that was hell 
 D-E-L and I'm back from hell 
 Trapped in hell where I learned to master self 
 Have you in a spell 
 With the magical raps that I tell 
 Caught in a rapture relax with yourself 
 Funk'll fill you with a passion that'll push you past it 
 And leave them tricky bastards in hell 
 H-E-double hockey sticks 
 I know I'm hot so hop off my dick 
 Talkin' shit at a mile a minute 
 You can tell a lieutenant to fuck the speed limit 
 You know when it's on once you smell that fire and brimstone 
 I'm at the endzone. 
 I find most of this bullshit pushed as entertainment 
 Very educational as soon as they make a home and try to take control 
 I just pick up a book and read 
 'Cause I can't believe 
 None of the crap they put on TV 
 Satellite vision 
 Hell if I listen to a motherfucker who whole mission 
 Is to get into my brain. 
 Sit and find blame with anything I got goin' 
 They plot is more important. 
 All I gotta say is 'so what?' 
 Reality TV is so far from that 
 Motherfuckers be washed up and try to come back. 
 -----Wax indicated madness 
 Imitation of the fatness that is now public access 
 At this moment in time 
 You are frozen in time 
 I am holding you with rhyme flow 
 Patterns that average adults say is thought provoking 
 He talks like he's brought up from Oakland 
 And hold notions back 
 Till I find the quotient 
 I feel like a Vulcan amongst trollkins 
 No comprehende 
 If they got the sense from they sensei 
 They sensei he been gay 
 And that's what me and my friends say. 
 H-E-double hockey sticks 
 I know I'm hot so hop off my dick 
 Talkin' shit at a mile a minute 
 You can tell a lieutenant to fuck the speed limit 
 You know when it's on once you smell that fire and brimstone 
 I'm at the endzone. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, 
 I present to you the finest, 
 Your Highness, 
 Sir Diesel, 
 Your knight in funky armor. 
 I'ma put you in the mood to funk 
 Funk'll have you feeling the groove 
 Yeah the groove is on me 
 On the house 
 I'm buying at the bar 
 Try me out 
 You know them other dudes is butt 
 Straight ass crack 
 Now you asking for your money back 
 This one's on me, on the house 
 Let me see something 
 Show me what it's all about 
 Hey, I never gave anybody hell 
 I just told them what's up 
 And they thought that was hell 
 D-E-L and I'm back from hell 
 Trapped in hell where I learned to master self 
 Sweat pouring on my shirt 
 The air conditioners don't work
