I writes rhymes for rehearsal 
 But first chill 
 I gotta little story to tell ya 
 How I almost caught a 
 Bad one 
 Add one to the list of 2,000 and 1 
 Stupid things to do 
 I had crew when they stepped at a party 
 Hardly even known I own a Smith and Wesson 
 But it's resting at home 
 In a shoe box 
 They see crews jock 
 So they wanna step and test the rep I got 
 I said 'Wait a second, 
 Check inside my coat for a shank' 
 They must be imagining that I'm money in the bank 
 They'll get spanked 
 'Cause I'm not the nigga 
 I got bigga brothers waiting in the bushes 
 To mush kids 
 I talk when I wanna talk 
 Never silence 
 Violence erupts when I clown ya 
 Catch a beat down ya 
 'Cause I never back away from niggas 
 Even if you gotta pistol 
 I dare ya pull the trigga 
 But that's suicide 
 Either you must die 
 Or I must 
 So why bust me 
 'Cause I'm guilty 
 Of being in the wrong place 
 At the wrong time 
 Comin' at ya in the wrong state of mind 
 I'm now in a hurry 
 A pow when a flurry 
 Of bullets come speeding by 
 I needn't die 
 I gotta make tracks and take back my words 
 I eat 'em 
 Cause everybody knows I didn't beat 'em... 
 "Being in the wrong place at the wrong time" 
 I'm out on the town 
 I don't frown at people 
 'Cause they tend to get offended 
 And then the heat will 
 Be on my ass 
 I got class 
 Never out of line, cause 
 I'm standing here without a nine 
 Pistols I wish will not blast me 
 TAZ be circlin' corners 
 Lookin' for Warners 
 You know the Brothers 
 Me and you 
 We didn't do shit 
 But we get hassled 
 Because we crew and we rollin' 
 This is my car 
 It isn't stollen 
 I hope you catch a slug 
 Straight in your colon 
 When ya walkin' the beat 
 I bet ya gotta sheet hangin' up in ya closet 
 Phuck this law shit 
 But there is two laws to follow, you know 
 There is laws of the city 
 And there's laws of the ghetto 
 I go to clubs with a smile on my face 
 Just in case niggas look and wanna whyle in the place 
 Cause of jealousy 
 Del is me 
 Only me 
 Niggas walkin' in poppin' shit 
 That's who the phonies be 
 Peep it one night 
 And you'll see it it's quite clear 
 Since we all know now 
 That's why we're 
 Never in the wrong place @ the wrong time! 
 Damn, I hate cops! 
 I need to bust they chops 
 Always gettin' props for the niggas they pop 
 Peep, 
 I smoke weed 
 Get weeded 
 'Cause I need it to calm my nerves before a pig get bleeded 
 I got busted for less than a gram of hash 
 They wanna cram my ass 
 In the slammer 
 That punk po-po 
 Bringin' back hash from Amsterdam is a no-no 
 I didn't know they would catch me 
 Punk mutt fetch me 
 Stretched me out at Customs 
 Gotta bust 'em 
 I can't call it 
 They found it in my wallet 
 Now Customs got me 
 And I just can't stall it 
 I wish they would leave me alone 
 Dog lookin' at me like 
 Feed me a bone 
 He might bite me 
 Very likely 
 They had to strike me with a fine or time 
 I said fine 
 Mines was 500 bones 
 For a gram of hash 
 My mind was blown 
 Come back to Michigan 
 So we can pitch again 
 Federal offense 
 Now I better go and convince the judge...
