 I wait to see your skull vibrate 
 When I bury the hatchet, I hope you catch it, I'll attach it 
 To his focus, when I broke his head in half 
 Feel the wrath, on my behalf 
 I drop math, and English, leave you squeamish 
 Then I squish your wish you're all fuckin' dreamers (alla y'all) 
 No time for tiddlywinks - if your titties is pink 
 Then you are white and I'm not the right man (not for me) 
 But you can blow pipe, my style is so tight 
 I be carvin, MC's when I'm starvin (I'm hungry) 
 You little chunks of punks that I dunks in my coffee 
 Get off me, I'm not your softie 
 But you will cough for your breath and phlegm, death to them 
 And silly broads, I fuck 'em and I chuck 'em (why?) 
 In the river, without a liver 
 And I donate to science, 'cause I'm a giver 
 The mysterious clearly busts brains with my brawn 
 Ask Sean, Cassidy about how I trash MC's 
 On the daily, Alex Haley had to write about it 
 Doubt it but it's true, get a clue (get a clue) 
 I'm tellin' you the truth you'll be toothless 
 The boots get smoked like they on fire, I desire 
 Like Salt'N'Pepa, I'll fuck a fat heffer (yeah) 
 Like I was Fritz the Cat, and she admits to fat 
 So I'm movin removin wackness from my stratosphere 
 If I thought that that was near 
 (CHORUS: repeat 4X w/ variations) 
 "You still bet that you can harm me, but you don't alarm me.."

 Listen to this 
 You're just a test tube baby, you can't fade me, but hey G 
 Your style is lazy, boy you're crazy 
 Losin it, check out my fusion kit (here it is) 
 It's welding rhymes and propelling, swelling (rrrah) 
 Getting bigger, getting niggaz in headlocks 
 Instead lock your scanners on Bruce Banner 
 I crush fools plus tunes used by the master 
 Will blast you into Tuesday, when I bruise a 
 Motherfucker, who mother suck a cock 
 And his brother fuck a jock, and his sister, got blisters 
 On her lips that be spreadin, she be-headin (yes she do) 
 Showin cleavage, with my futuristic styles I leave kids 
 In a trance, hypnotizin your eyes spin 
 Back in your head like you dead but instead you was buggin 
 Ugly bitches get the dillz after shows (shows) 
 'Cause I don't be runnin' after hoes that be stank 
 I thank the Lord, for my thought 
 Connected to the microphone, so check the cycle tone 
 That I be arousin, housin your blouse and your pumps 
 The mac daddy makes you jump! (yeah) 
 I pump info, into nymphos, who be bonin 
 Clonin, Vanessa Del Rio 
 And yes sir Del see no evil, hear no evil 
 It's normal, I come formal, to keep 'em warm till the morn' 
 (Sample in chorus repeats to fade)
