(Del The Funky Homosapien - 1st Verse) 
 Check my comprehensive catalog of crafts 
 I'm daft 
 I battle all like I don't have it all 
 Avant-garde 
 Battlestar Galactica 
 Got rhymes per capita 
 I'm shining through the aperture 
 But I'm not gonna bust no caps for ya (nah) 
 That's another genre 
 I'm the black bomber 
 Track charmer 
 Sack burner 
 Distract burdens 
 If it ain't that urgent 
 Nerve prints 
 Word sentinel invisible infidel interstellar 
 Hella clever 
 Endeavors immeasurable 
 With only heaven to go incredible 
 Melodramatic wit tales from the tablet 
 You fail cause you average 
 Regardless of your sells and your status 
 You extra baggage 
 I bamboozle like I'm mobbin' in a Landcruiser 
 Down MacArthur 
 Artistic archer 
 Autistic misfit 
 You'll get the sickness 
 When I spit the wickedness 
 And split cha wig like Kid Icarus 
 Leave you headless like Icky-bod 
 I infuriated, tick you off 
 Stick to Pop 
 Hip-Hop's too dificult 
 To me, it's a cult 
 Lyrics lacerated, slit cha throat 
 Beat cha brain down like Piscopo with Smith and Colt 
 I don't know, Different Strokes 
 So respect me for I whip out ol' Betsy 
 Surgically remove you from my testes 
 Purposely improve you just to see who the best be 
 But sold up sexy 
 Take a poll and know the prestige 
 Large lefty 
 I automate 
 Animate 
 My soul sanitation like I gotta canvas painting 
 Manifestions 
 Eh, who's ever hearin' this 
 Deltron-Z be a lyricist 
 Frontin' on your fake false appearances 
 "Press Rewind" (Sadat X sample) 
 Drive you delirious 
 Dead serious 
 The eeriest mic mysterious 
 Eh peep, who's ever hearin' this 
 Deltron-Z be a lyricist 
 Frontin' on your fake false appearances 
 "Press Rewind" (Sadat X sample) 
 Drive you delirious 
 Dead serious 
 The eeriest mic mysterious 
 (Scratching) 
 "Press Rewind" (Sadat X sample) 
 (Del The Funky Homosapien - 2nd Verse) 
 Go ahead, try symbiosis 
 But most rap artist don't have any focus 
 Think they flippin' chips 
 Try penny brokers 
 Kipsco or pennyloafers 
 Get my album I'll show you how it's done 
 Del-ateous 
 Hella atrocious wit vocals 
 My throat holds verbal choke pose 
 Po-po's in ya scrolls 
 My goals are not rifles 
 I flow scrimmage like the Micronots 
 You might go pop and I might grow crops 
 Go get the gestapo 
 You riskin' a pot full of gold 
 Pull a zodiac sign to halftime 
 Reenact rhymes from a past life of a flashlight 
 Man, you don't know the half 
 Dash right to the phonograph 
 Blow your balderdash 
 Coordinates confirm 
 Subordinates will learn 
 My ordnance is stern so supportin' my fern 
 Is the only way in this lonely age where you goin' crazed 
 Your style is sold and paid for 'cause I made more 
 Water emcees like a bayshore 
 Bullets graze doors (Where) 
 In Oakland where they lay law 
 Del is going AWOL wit napalm 
 Eight bombs taped to my arms like the town crier 
 Now miser 
 Strider 
 Spit exciter 
 Rippin' plywood 
 Forget beef cakin' lyrical cheapskates 
 Try Del and win the sweepstakes 
 What I make is so hot, it's seethin' 
 Off the deep end 
 Stop your breathin' 
 Caught cha sleepin' 
 Now you're peekin' like you've eaten 
 A hundred microdots wreck your equinox 
 Delete every piece of props 
 Leave your perforated 
 Curb your hatred 
 Disserve your matrix in the Word Olympics 
 Completely furnished wit burners like Ted Turner 
 I broadcast the classics 
 Fabu-lass, fa-tastic 
 Peep, who ever hearin' this 
 Deltron-Z be a lyricist 
 Frontin' on your fake false appearances 
 "Press Rewind" (Sadat X sample) 
 Drive you delirious 
 Dead serious 
 The eeriest mic mysterious 
 Hey, who ever hearin' this 
 Deltron-Z be a lyricist 
 Frontin' on your fake false appearances 
 "Press Rewind" (Sadat X sample) 
 Drive you delirious 
 Dead serious 
 The eeriest mic mysterious 
 (Del) 
 And the survey says 
 Go practice or something man 
 You know 
 Peace 
 "Press Rewind" (Sadat X Sample) 
 Ah-hah
