Thieves in the night, stick you in the alleyway 
 They might cause fright, they stick you up for Bally suede shoes 
 And in the news, and even on Geraldo 
 You can choose who will lose a pair of shoes (Yup!) word 
 The ones with the Reebok Pumps get their rumps rearranged 
 For their change now their down in the dumps (Yup) 
 You sprint two yards, to sport 'em on the first day of school 
 And like a fool, you went out like the worst way 
 They pulled out a tool, and asked you to remove them 
 Quickly, I told 'em not to do it and they hit me (What?) in the mouth 
 With the nine, I thought they was like kinfolk (punk) 
 I never thought crime would elevate up to Twin Oaks what 
 But hey, everybody is a victim 
 Hoodz come in dozens, the magic word is (stick em) 
 When they spot you and they got you and you can't deal with em 
 All because you spent two G's on your Boomin System 
 Loud enough for the whole block to hear 
 But now they caught you at the light and you're drownin in your tears 
 (Punk you better raise your ass up out this car) 
 (Come off the car punk 'fore your ass gets blast) 
 And never was your fault that your shit was expensive 
 You shoulda bought a vault, and now I gotta mention that 
 Hoodz come in dozens, read it in the papers 
 Seems like everyone caught a little vapors 
 You can't escape em, so don't even plan it 
 Gangsta Boogie fever has taken over planet Earth 
 Now your life is worth a pair of Jordan's? 
 Now I wear Vans and my fans think I'm poor 
 When I walk down the block, with money in my sock and shoe 
 I hate you Mista Gangsta, cause everyone is mocking you 
 Now I can't get no rest because your pests keep 
 Killing little children like their speakers are worth a million 
 Plus, it really is a bummer 
 Someone tried to get me for a coat last summer 
 (Your coat, check it in punk, hahah!) Damn 
 Hoodz come in dozens so watch your back 
 'Cause they all on the attack and you'll never know 
 When they'll show up, but when they do 
 You better throw up your hands like a fan and surrender 
 Nigga don't be a pretender 
 You ain't the Hulk G 
 Give up the cash and all the big bulky jewelry 
 (All of it) *In what, daylight?* That's the plan kid 
 They don't even care if it's Candid 
 Because passersby mind they own beeswax 
 So they like steppin to you like yo I'll take these blacks 
 Give up your cash and your jewels without a argumnet 
 Otherwise you'll catch one between the eyes (bang!) 
 Don't play hero, cause hero plus a bullet equals zero 
 Give up your dough and cheerio old chap 
 You didn't get a cap busted in your temple 
 See, it's just that simple 
 Remember that hoodz come in dozens 
 (You're god damn right) 
 Hoodz come in dozens 
 (Like thieves in the night) 
 Hoodz come in dozens 
 (Punks runnin' out of sight) 
 (So gimme them motherfuckin Nike's)
