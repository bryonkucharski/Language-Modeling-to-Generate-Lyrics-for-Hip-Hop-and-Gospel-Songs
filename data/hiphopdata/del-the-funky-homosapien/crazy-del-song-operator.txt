(Scratching, random dialogue) 
 I seek souls like mines 
 So my mind finds inner peace 
 And then a beast 
 Could never devour 
 My powers arrive 
 From survivors of this holocaust. 
 Please be hopeful, 
 Never thinkin' all is lost 
 In my sector, 
 Specter 
 Slidin', 
 Collidin' with my lifestyle 
 So I fight while they threaten me, 
 Sweatin' me - 
 Well I'm quite mild, 
 The world makes me gnarly, 
 But an introvert not hardly. 
 I deal with it. 
 I feel a bit 
 Under the weather, 
 I need to pull my pieces back together. 
 Fallin' apart, stallin' a heart of sincerity 
 Since there will be another stoplight 
 And it's not right 
 So I might go insane of this brain 
 Of mine 
 Maintain a line that has been tame 
 Before the tempest. 
 I'm looking to my better interests. 
 I never tried to post or tried to impress 
 Anyone 
 So why do I got to suffer 
 Every single day it seems the way of the world is rougher. 
 And then you wonder why I love to hallucinate, 
 Because I never ever thought I would get used to hate. 
 So I imbedded my time within my mind, 
 And rhymin' 
 Was the only way I kept from bein' confined 
 To quarters, 
 Sure there's good times and bad, 
 But the bad time's are overwhelming, 
 And how the hell things 
 Get out of hand I ask you, 
 You have to give an answer; 
 Eating at my brain like it was cancer. 
 Worryin'. 
 Hurryin', 
 My thought processes. 
 I got offices 
 Imbedded in my skull, 
 A million secretaries actin' scary 
 When they type 200 words per minute. 
 It just occurred to me I'm in it. 
 'Cause I'm the boss, 
 The head honcho, 
 At least to this mutiny. 
 The whole idea is cute to me. 
 So I entertain it 
 And let my brain get 
 Deeper and deeper 
 Until it vibrates like a beeper 
 And I can't maintain it. 
 So what's the verdict? 
 It's D.E.L. the visionary and I come with the absurd shit. 
 (Break with freaky "call the operator" sample) 
 If I had not one friend I would be gooooone. 
 Way in outer space singin' one sooooong: 
 'Zippety doo dah, zippety day, 
 My oh my what a wonderful day 
 When my mind's dusted'. 
 Thrusted 
 Out beyond the stars, I'm the satellite. 
 Transmittin, fit in situations that'll rattle tikes - 
 Scare 'em, 
 Dare 'em to go farther. 
 So then I go father, 
 Burnin' my brain out with mental lava. 
 Scalding, 
 All things 
 Rearrange so I never socialize, 
 When you feel my eyes. 
 The dilated pupils, 
 I violated scruples, 
 'Cause I told myself I'd never do it again, 
 But now I grin. 
 Laugh on the inside, 
 Men tried to strap me 
 In a straight jacket 
 When I laugh and I'm happy 
 For two hours straight, 
 These powers hate me 
 And they make me wanna cower, 
 But lately I've been feeling like a tower. 
 Tall and sturdy, 
 Wordy, though I never say a word, 
 'Cause when I say a word, 
 Before it's like they never heard. 
 Nothing ever changes except within my cerebellum, 
 So I'll never tell 'em, 
 Never tell 'em, 
 Never tell 'em. 
 I'll tell it to my soul over and over 
 Even though I'm locked within a room with padded walls, 
 I'm never sober. 
 Inspections, 
 Injections, 
 Keep me confined 
 To my inner thoughts 
 And this is how I lost my mind. 
 (Break with maniacal laughter)
