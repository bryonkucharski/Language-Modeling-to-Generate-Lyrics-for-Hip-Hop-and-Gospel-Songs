"Earth to Del, Earth to Del, Earth to Del do you read me? 
 Do you copy Del? It seems we've lost radio contact 
 Descend for warp speed so you can receive transmission" 
 Each rap is texture-mapped to perfection 
 A 3-D world for you to step in 
 I leave MC's stranded on asteroids 
 Floatin through the void of space 
 Del the black man, African back again 
 Crackin' windshields, so I can heal your souls 
 When you feel my flows 
 A wild beast when I piece together beats like puzzles 
 MCs feel muzzled like dobermans 
 It's over when you try duplicate 
 And then you're due for 8 for tryin' to sink your teeth in 
 Meetin your maker, Del the caretaker here break your life 
 Away from you faker the Tammy Faye Baker 
 I shake your brain up like Quaker Oats 
 For tryin' to memorize my moniacle quotes 
 The funk coats your eardrums, Oaklands where we're from 
 The deviant, workin feverishly but easily 
 Eagerly awaiting your arrival 
 Hide all you cowards, you're powerless I'm live and in technicolor and 
 Tumorous 
 Your humorous, my rhymes are numerous 
 I'm too elaborate in my habitat 
 With words that hit your skull like a battle ax, imagine that 
 I'm actually destined 'cause I'm acutal perfection 
 Equals natural selection with rhymes as my secret weapon 
 This involvement in my newest installment 
 Is dissolved in the chains on your brains like solvent 
 I can't call it, all it means is my genes 
 Comes from supreme beings and sess that cha can't step ta 
 No way out come right in, writin incredible shit 
 They can't meddle with us 
 Future development is too intelligent 
 Future development, too too intelligent 
 No way out come right in, writin incredible shit 
 You can't meddle with us 
 "And you say it, And niggaz are still frontin with that 
 Old technology shit, why is this soundin garbage?" 
 To many fans and not enough artists 
 Niggaz frontin heartless like they packin ultra cartriges 
 You ain't gonna smoke me, you smoke weed 
 I've seen some sick characters and they ain't scared a ya 
 The true soldiers who will unload on your intersect 
 Not me I'm into Tex and Mex 
 Giant robos and ponos, and road shows 
 I like a blow doe on the latest not the status quo though 
 More pull than yo-yo duncan 
 Quit pashin in my rappin' like a tongue kissin' right on by the hundreds 
 With no bass the foundation crumbles 
 Like niggaz bumble they whole life over rumbles 
 Scandals, sure you got mad skills 
 But unless you gonna be a boxer who's gonna offer 
 Your hand script "Nobody" I used to program computers 
 Now I make manuvers on the mic to screw ya 
 On the ole, how it goes how the flow for the uninitiated 
 Plus on the side, get my own life sitiated 
 You know writin lyrics in between lines 
 Play some Samauri Spirits, oops 
 Drop funky like defication, poop 
 Leavin' ya mute moose, speechless 
 Niggaz blackin out like an eclipse 
 No defense for your pretense 
 Which is just a feat to proposal 
 Towards your disposal 
 Del flow solo, fully mobilized the wise words 
 So niggaz can get the total 
 Perception, perfection destined for greatness 
 Etched in your consciousness, metaphorically monstrous 
 Future development is too intelligent 
 Future development too too intelligent
