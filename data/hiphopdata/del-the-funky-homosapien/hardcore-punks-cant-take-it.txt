Yeah man, half these motherfuckas, man, is wack, man 
 Half these, as a matter of fact, like, like, like 
 3/4 of y'all motherfuckas is wack, that's real 
 Ain't saying shit, I don't even give a fuck, man 
 Shit's hardcore, man, punks can't take it 
 Y'all, I keep it hardcore and punks can't take it 
 I got that shit passed down to me by foul situations 
 Dealin', give a fuck how you clowns be feelin' 
 I can't sleep sound without thousands peelin' 
 Like potatoes 
 How my day goes 
 Straight to work, innovate flows, renovate tones 
 Penetrate domes when they ain't knowin' 
 Illiteracy, all time high 
 It's bigger than me, I just wade through the hate juice 
 It ain't cool but shit that's what'll make you 
 Come through with a breakthrough 
 The adversity, work it with the need to express 
 Dump off the excess and zone inside my headset 
 And give way game like midway engraved in the caverns 
 Where the funk is imagined and conjured 
 Creating a monster 
 It won't be long till the drama spill 
 I got a stronger will 
 Go beyond the field because I wanna 
 Honor, shield my personal armor 
 From my mentality that you piranhas long to conquer 
 But this time we gonna have some fish fry 
 Twist time so it benefit mine 
 Yeah, in the nick of time 
 Nickel slick rhymes 
 Shift sides to the flip side 
 Soak a motherfucka, let 'em drip dry 
 Can't take it 
 I can't even believe this shit, you motherfuckas 
 You know how it feels 
 Some, some, some 
 Sometimes I feel the place is disgraceful 
 And no reason in particular 
 Pictures of the past life I was stuck in 
 Inducted in the ruckus, a lot of destructive motherfuckas 
 Some was G's for real and some was busters 
 Some were corrupted and couldn't be trusted 
 I wasn't above it, I wasn't a thug but a knuckle-head buggin' 
 And fuckin' shit up for nothin' 
 Hip Hop appeared like a storybook fantasy 
 A lot of fools capped on me 
 When I rapped for free in front of the whole faculty 
 After recess, jealous dummies wanted to scrap with me 
 I caught a few blows, I fucked some fools up 
 Now they comin' to school with they tools tucked 
 You know they pride, can never leave it at a few cuts 
 And bruises signifying that they was losers 
 I'm like, please tell me who was the winner then? 
 Chasin' me with knives with they bigger friends 
 And family members and none of them fools was badly injured 
 I remember 
 I laid low 'til could stray from home 
 I had to stay in the safe zone 
 Told myself, I'm gonna make it with these great flows 
 I make, those bozo's chose they fate, I used to know 
 Those who would hold the weight 
 I never turned up my nose 
 But always wanted to know they were straight 
 Closed casket, no joke, so is the wake 
 And half of them know they fake, tryna show some strength 
 It use to feel like there's no escape 
 I was broke, no dates, all the hoes would fake 
 All the bro's on the block tell me that the flow was dope 
 So there's hope, just hold that rope and don't let go 
 'Cause some of them lost they grip 
 Habitual liars always tryna start some shit 
 Hell, don't be a target, be smart and swift 
 Mind my business but remember you was a part of this 
 I never forgot and put it in the bars I spit 
 So all you crabs in the bucket, get off my dick 
 'Fore your ass get served in a match of words 
 Hardcore just like your ass deserve 
 Your ass deserve 
 Can you take it? 
 Can you take it?
