Don't forget ya niggas 
 My rep gets bigger 
 And figgers on my checks 
 Flex, 
 Like Hercules 
 When I flow with ease 
 Usin' lingo that'll bring mo hoes 
 Front and center 
 Enta this blissful twist 
 Full of fun, for my niggas 
 Here's another one 
 You get a hand shake 
 And take a copy of the UNA 
 We're doin' a service 
 And who are they? 
 Questions and answers 
 And we can sure 
 Capture the spirits in ya soul cause the man's pure 
 And furious, 
 Cause curiosity killed the cat 
 Why fill the gat with lead and leave a nigga dead? 
 But if you was that nigga 
 Don't sweat me 
 'Cause if I was that nigga I wouldn't pull the trigga 
 Protect yourself but don't project yourself 
 Into trouble 
 Cause, you'll perish, there is 
 Some things I never forget 
 Police sweats when we out posted like marionettes 
 We jets, unless them hands be empty 
 They lookin' for niggas, yeah 
 They not allowed to peel me. 
 "Don't forget your niggas..." 
 Don't forget ya niggas 
 Even if they low down niggas 
 'Cause I sho found niggas 
 Down on they luck 
 Here's a pound, and a buck 
 And you better not spend it on no booze 
 Choose what is more important 
 I'm a nigga who will ford shit 
 Before it starts 
 We score with heart 
 Artistic values 
 And I'll use a portion of the brain 
 Other niggas is ignorin' 
 Ya snorin' 
 What's up my niggas 
 Hi niggas 
 I figures 
 I'm the nigga who can rig a rhythm to ya soul 
 Plain and simple 
 Then pull, other tricks out my sleeve 
 And leave unseen 
 Clean and slicklike 
 Niggas need to get they shit right 
 For they step to HIEROGLYPHICS it might 
 Prove fatal 
 So move, wait till I'm dona 
 I use fun and fabrications 
 For your imagination 
 Wastin', spillin' 
 Blood when I'm ill & 
 Depressed 
 'Cause I take it out on others 
 Not the brothers 
 Just record executives 
 And I bet you give 
 Up ya cash 
 When I leave you with a gash in ya ass 
 'Cause I had a heart when I started 
 Now I departed 
 And I'm back again 
 Give me ends 
 'Fore I bust into ya office squeezin' triggas 
 Because you, because you, cause you forgot us niggas. 
 (Chrus:) 
 Now peep 
 I knew a nigga that was large 
 That nigga used to rap good 
 Now I'm askin' him 
 Perhaps, could you tell me how you fell off 
 Yet you was well off 
 But now the real niggas think ya soft 
 'Cause we beat rhymes 
 You can't keep up with the times 
 It seems you have styles combined 
 From other fools 
 And you'll discover who will be a real nigga 
 You da man 
 You supposed to skill niggas 
 When you say you will 
 You don't display you skill 
 And still you throw your niggas out the doors 
 Scores of years ago you was bros 
 But now you got a little dough 
 And yeah you tryin' to play him like a hoe 
 But I don't think so 
 He ain't a puppet 
 Enough with that shit 
 Take that job, 
 Stuff it 
 Up ya ass 
 Just gimme enough for gas 
 I'm rough & I can last, 
 And get my own phuckin' cash 
 Well that's that 
 And what do you get for that? 
 Ooh you dirty rat 
 How could you forget the fool 
 That was down wit ya in school 
 Y'all use ta shoot pool 
 Ya sorry busta 
 Never could trust a 
 Nigga think he's so large 
 That nobody can thrust him 
 Out the pilot seat 
 Ejected 
 You forgot ya nigga 
 Ya assed out 
 Expect it.
