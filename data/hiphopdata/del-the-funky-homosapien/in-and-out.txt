Fun, even funner 
 I'm the gunner sub-machine gun 
 It don't seem right, that they don't get my theme right 
 They don't know me, 
 So we move forward 
 More words and phrases 
 My style amazes 
 Come into the scene with the means to rip shit 
 My brain's power packed with the proper equipment 
 So step 
 I come inta the area to bury ya 
 I compose the flows 
 Makin' people merrier 
 Never the less, I sever the flesh 
 With a razor 
 Reserve the major beef 
 I'ma slay ya, hey 
 You never came across a person like me 
 I never instigate 
 First come strike me 
 Then I'll flip 
 And rip clothing, and I'm loathing 
 MCs who front like I don't know things 
 Uh uh 
 Check again 
 I get wreck again 
 On the down low 
 Because you sound slow 
 Retarded MCs get neglected 
 And check it 
 Anytime I hafta show a foe 
 I'ma flex it 
 Then I exit 
 With my records and my next shit 
 Prepared, so be scared 
 I strike unexpected 
 I write rhymes in sections 
 Testin' my slang 
 I bang MCs with these 
 And make 'em hang 
 Dangle, what's ya angle? 
 When I strangle and choke 
 I hold Bennedicts by their throat 
 Until they sing notes like a canary 
 Fairy, or genies 
 We slipped out 
 They never seen me bust his face 
 I like bass when it hums 
 And that sums up my properties for the dum-dums 
 Someone need to check him 
 Deck him 
 Slam him 
 And put him in the bushes 
 So 'shush' kids 
 No one needs to know 
 I'll proceed and go into 
 And then tell ya what I've been through. 
 "In one ear, right out the other, 
 Go tell ya sister, go tell ya mother, 
 In one ear, right out the other, 
 Go tell ya father, go tell ya brother, 
 In one ear, right out the other." 
 I would feel comfortable 
 If your front would go elsewhere 
 Or disappear 
 Hear my specific style that's speaking 
 Creeking, making noises in the nighttime 
 When I write rhymes 
 I look out my window 
 It's a bright day 
 And I might display my skills in the hills 
 Or, in a different neighborhood 
 Cause my flavor could 
 Be the best, so lets test this 
 Yes, bitch 
 I saw you posted at the pool table 
 I could never talk to you 
 But now a fool's able 
 With the best of luck 
 And, hey, how do you impress a duck? 
 By pullin' out a wad of bucks 
 Shucks 
 I need to stop this 
 I plop this, played this 
 I murder MCs 
 And leave their pens inkless 
 Do you think this is a twist 
 A turn, I insist 
 To burn those foes who haven't learned 
 To keep they mouths closed 
 Guinness Stout flows 
 Through your intestines, when life is depressin' 
 I built my foundation using patients 
 Some didn't hear us 
 Some had to state it...
