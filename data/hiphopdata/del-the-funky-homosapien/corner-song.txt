We 'bout to roll to the corner me and my crew 
 We 'bout to roll to the corner and get us some brew 
 We 'bout to roll to the corner and get some swishers too 
 So we can role a fat blunt and get perfed 
 Another fine day in this land I live 
 Oakland we're they don't give a shit and that's it 
 You know I'm sellin' they can split the profit 50 50 
 With this other brother who went in half with me 
 Now, first before we burst the move 
 We gotta sooth our nerves with the liquor 
 Then we don't bicker 
 We'll be relaxed ask your mama 
 This shit is like a war zone 
 Streets is hot like the Bahamas 
 But we will stay away from the drama 
 I'm wearin' my snipe, my arctic jacket with the wool like a llama 
 Then we had to pause like a comma 
 Cause someone got stuck and buck and family was outside with trama 
 We heard the shots from inside and went there when the gats go off 
 I hit the deckin' high 
 And a popo said they got their own time they lie 
 But you gotta give them credit they try 
 I see a mother cry and I'm wondering why 
 And my man said fuck it ain't nothin' we can do 
 But to continue our mission down the block for the brew 
 And we out (yeah, yeah) 
 On our way we 'bout half way there 
 Children runnin' everywhere like they just don't care 
 The Muslim Bakery is like right between 
 And if I pass by with beer they will look at me mean 
 So I ducks in and gets my Final Call now 
 Cause still my brain gotta be well endowed and proud 
 The ambulances signals and glances 
 So let's hurry up and take no chances 
 Niggas step to us trying to rap like we got all the answers 
 In front of the store trying to work that slide ahead 
 The pant handlers they got no amateurs 
 Daily reminders of how I gotta find a way to come up 
 And sums up life along with the kids and a wife 
 But anyway 
 We pass the local grocery store 
 And you can be sure the meats and the products ain't good no more 
 Some of it is from days before 
 I want it fresh and the clerk ain't my race so he stress 
 They doin' me in my community 
 Fuck it, we there 
 Ain't enough for a 6 pack so we had to share 
 A nice little strole through the April spring air 
 We hide on shit so the nation don't see it there
