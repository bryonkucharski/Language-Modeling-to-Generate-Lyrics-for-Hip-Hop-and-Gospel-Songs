Fresh from the meadow with a mellow attitude 
 I was plannin' to pursue another quest for the bus 
 I had to go to San Fran, it's something that I can't stand 
 It's beggin' for a ride with ma dukes makes a fuss 
 I don't like fussin' so I ask my older cousin 
 Could he maybe find time to give the D-E-L a lift 
 He said it is impossible because he has a roster full of plans for the 
 Day 
 I had to go and sift through pennies in my jeans 
 To many it may seem that the public transportation really isn't keen 
 And I agree with the theory 
 Because it's 3:30 and the bus was due at 2:35 
 I wear my Girbauds so I can wait with pride 
 I waited at the bus stop feeling kinda high 
 From a spliff that I smoked 
 I riffed and provoked 
 A liitle scene when the bus arrived late like a joke 
 With a corny punchline 
 And it was only lunchtime 
 The bus should've been here, the driver had much time 
 To get is act together 
 No matter what the weather 
 Now I'm sittin' at the bus stop waitin' like forever 
 (SKIT #1) 
 When oh when is the bus gonna come 
 I'm getting sick and tired of the wait 
 When oh when is the bus gonna come 
 Well here comes a pack of about 14 
 Lookin' real mean with hoodies and jeans 
 And bad attitudes and I wasn't in the mood 
 For no head on collision with the hoods 
 Try to use my transfer but it's no good 
 Would these rough lookin' kids get busy with the youngsta 
 Amongst the many who must catch rapid transit to get through the city 
 I'm not certain 
 But if I go sit in the back it's curtains 
 Kids wanna ride the back 
 What kinda shit is that? 
 Nowadays niggas can't wait to hit the back 
 Let me stand in the front with the elderly 
 So those other cats won't raise hell with me 
 (SKIT #2) 
 Oh golly gee, not another day on the 46A 
 I should've caught the 46B 
 'Cause dukes takes the mass scene and group through the trees 
 And shoots the breeze with the ladies 
 Look at that around the way girl 
 Yeah, I see her 
 (Whistle) More crack than a drug dealer 
 A kid sits by me with a gang of afro sheen on 
 I'm not Joe Clark and I would hate for him to lean on 
 My shoulder and try to hold a conversation 
 'Cause I don't have the patience 
 When oh when is the bus gonna reach its destination 
 Question over space and time 
 Wastin' time 
 Word up, I can't take this line of nitwits 
 I'm about to have a fit quick 
 'Cause this trip here is making me car sick 
 Check out the brother with the loaded .38 
 Braggin' to his buddies about the money that he makes 
 Sellin' crack viles like pancakes 
 To baseheads just like the one 
 That's sittin' by the window starvin' for a fix 
 He spent his last 80 cents on fare 
 He raises up and lets me get in his chair 
 Then I sit and take a snooze 
 But I still lose 
 'Cause I cruise right past my stop 
 Had to get off and walk 15 blocks...
