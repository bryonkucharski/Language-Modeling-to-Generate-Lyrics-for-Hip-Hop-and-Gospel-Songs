 Up front, introducing my man Pep Love 
 (Pep Love) 
 My introduction: 
 It's such an unbelievable pleasure 
 For you to treasure; 
 And much needed too 
 Make it phat though 
 On another plateau- 
 You beginning to beginning to groove; 
 I do it natural 
 As we get Jazzy with classy shit 
 To make them hard ass rappers wanna blast me (buck buck) 
 'Cause I exemplify a typified mac 
 In actin' like the shit nigga 
 Mashin rappers with a passion 
 When I get Tip and Tribe flashion lyrics 
 I smash your spirits 
 Like a big disappointment 
 But this here shit will surprise ya 
 Devise a plan: 
 The pipsqueaks get tweaked 
 Cause of the size of demand 
 So if you wanna measure up 
 Then press your luck 
 'Cause when I'm in the cut 
 Man there ain't no catchin up 
 I bet ya never heard a nigga with a bigga this flow 
 Bigga this bro 
 Gettin' ate like a clitoris? 
 No. 
 I never could'a seen it- 
 I rip a rapper's balls off 
 To make him scream when its convenient. 
 Hear ye hear ye 
 Clearly we're the 
 Undisputed ones that you get mad at when you hear me 
 Pompous comp. just barely even registered on the meter 
 'Cause we the niggas that they checkin' for 
 Me and you or, you and him 
 Ruinin' them 
 Doin' men in 
 When I'm cluing them in 
 On the one 
 (Del) 
 Ya two... three, four 
 (Q-Tip) 
 Now niggas know I got lyrics out the anal 
 And any move that you make could be fatal 
 The poet that shows it: 
 And some of y'all niggas know it when ya 
 Grab the mic and you can't recite 
 Yo that gets me irate when ya can't debate 
 But wait- Now ya niggas think that I'm ya runnin' mate? 
 Naw phukk that, 'cause when I grab the baton I'm gone (zoom) 
 All around the track like a runnin' maniac (damn) 
 You babblin your babblin son; what the phukk? 
 Anybody here rap that doesn't go buck? 
 But can you grab the mic and kick ill shit? (like) 
 Stun'em with the verbs, instead of using clips. 
 Check it: I flip styles by the dozen; 
 I-could-even-(too fast) that I was but I wasn't 
 You MC's are slipping into rigor mortis 
 Give it up please 
 And just support this; 
 I got styles that are legendary 
 Even in the clink 
 Lyrically I'm like, 
 What the phukk you think? 
 'Cause I'm down with the D-E-L 
 So what the hell? 
 (Del) 
 (Haha!) 
 I never come from the temple a simple rap 
 Cause your raps poor 
 I'm on track 
 I lap yours 
 Collapse yours 
 Elapse forever 
 You're never gonna get better bitin' my friend 
 But I lend a hand helping 
 MC's yelping like puppies (Arf! Arf!) 
 Their rhymes are simple 
 My rhymes are roughed up 
 Like a duffle bag 
 Mags on my wheels squeal 
 Peel out towards your head 
 While others bust lead 
 That's dead 
 I beat your head in the resin when the pipe hits the buds in my 
 Chamber 
 My rhymes are never tamer 
 Perpetrators I'ma hurt ya later/after 
 On the path of danger 
 I got fangs not bangs 
 Like a bitch which I use to puncture 
 With punctuation- 
 And mutation 
 Racin' like my thoughts 
 Bust shots to scatter 
 And my latter lets me elevate 
 Over MC's that are hella fake 
 My reaction to your rappin' is laughin' 
 It has been for askin they get their ass kicked 
 'Cause they're plastic 
 I'm bringing lyrical lacerations 
 That you're tastin 
 Painful I mame foes 
 Metaphorically 
 Historically used the hip hop 
 To make your neck pop 
 Naw the eyes 'cause I kick the modern style 
 (Modern style, haha!) 
 (Cut:) 
 The undisputed ones that you get mad at 
 The undisputed ones that you get mad at 
 The undisputed ones that you get mad at 
 When you ... grab the mike and you can't recite
