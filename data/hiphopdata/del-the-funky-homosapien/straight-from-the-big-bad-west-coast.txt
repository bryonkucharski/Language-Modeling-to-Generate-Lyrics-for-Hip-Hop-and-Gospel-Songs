Straight from the big bad west coast, let's go 
 (You wanna be startin somethin', just funkin') 
 Straight from the big bad west coast, let's go 
 (Spell it D-Z-L is) 
 Straight from the big bad west coast, let's go 
 (Oh, pop in peace, clap and tease) 
 Straight from the big bad west coast, let's go 
 (You know what it is, do you?) 
 I don't know, man, I mean 
 Every time I hear these weak niggas get to rappin', I just like 
 Dog, [Incomprehensible] 
 It, it's a fun, it's a funny feeling 
 Like motherfuckers think we all about the trash 
 I'm like, nigger, y'all got hot garbage out on the curb too 
 (Let's go, let's go) 
 Don't be tryin' to clown [Incomprehensible] 
 Yeah, I'm Sir DzL, the title mean regal 
 You better, ah, smell my funk from the Big Yeah Area 
 And it ain't no punk, dig? 
 (Donkey Kong part 2) 
 Yo, straight from the big bad west coast, let's go 
 DzL, you guest host deadly like asbestos 
 Destro wrestlin', check 'em with a death hold 
 Pretzel, Gracie School of Jujitstu twist you 
 There's a small issue 
 Somebody said we were fish food 
 'Cause the spotlight ain't hittin', dudes 
 You kiddin', fool 
 Nigga, a spotlight? I got light 
 Showin' you the way like a lighthouse 
 It ain't my fault you too dumb to try it out 
 For fear of lookin' like you lesser 
 Worryin' about other people and they weak suggestions 
 Like, "Don't do that, that shit is cornball" 
 They say the same shit to me 
 While I'm on tour and far out they reach 
 How's the streets? I often wonder 
 'Cause they sittin' on that same milk crate 
 I understand why they feel hate 
 It hurts when you set straight 
 Quit talkin', start watchin' 
 My name is Sir DzL, I'm not them other options 
 I got it goin' on and poppin' 
 Too Short proved you could do it, no problem 
 Ice Cube, Sir Jinx really stirred the drinks 
 I'm talkin' 'bout that path 
 Back then with wax on a phonograph 
 I'll plant you now and dig you up later 
 You need to quit hatin', conduct an investigation 
 West civilization got somethin' to add to the equation 
 And that ain't no Jim Crow shit 
 That you can't drink from my water fountain, bullshit 
 I gots love for all the cats rappin' 
 Wherever they makin' it happen, it's all action 
 And that's what's happenin' literally 
 I just peep some niggas think that they can shit on a beat 
 By the most popular producer out circa 
 When you unearthed that worthless waste 
 Take that auto tune off, leave the gimmicks at home 
 You ain't foolin' nobody, dumb nigga, it's on 
 Let me spit somethin' for 'em 
 Let the homie twist somethin' for 'em 
 Them Cali buds, ah, ha, now he feel the Cali love 
 Go 'head, shit, it's on the house 
 Now relax and peep Cali got somethin' for the drought 
 See this 
 Straight from the big bad west coast, let's go 
 Straight from the big bad west coast, let's go 
 Straight from the big bad west coast, let's go 
 Straight from the big bad west coast, let's go 
 Yo, don't get me wrong, I salute the Bronx 
 I would never dare to do this art and dilute the content 
 Ever since I heard the phonics 
 Reminded me of Richard Pryor 
 That's the only rapper that I could mention 
 Prior to that, what Melle Mel was rappin' about? 
 I could see that from the back of my house 
 And that was before crack was out 
 Niggas just was freebasin' 
 But I was mesmerized by complete phrases 
 Poignant statements that if written out on paper 
 You haters couldn't say shit 
 It was crazy 'cause flavor appealed to the days I seen 
 Growin' up as a child in the '70s 
 Y'all don't know nothin' 'bout that 
 Motherfuckers, be glad to hop out the shack 
 And upgrade like the Jeffersons 
 Now motherfuckers act like the ghetto is the best it is 
 And that's ain't a hater statement 
 If you love it then save it, it is what you make it 
 And basically it's down to the basics 
 Survival of the fittest and the quick witted 
 Makes no difference, the distance apart 
 My whole fuckin' family from the south now 
 I wish you would start 
 I got peeps in the east too 
 All my kin in South Central, I see you 
 My cousin Tigre' used to babysit me 
 Encouraged my rappin' and would watch MTV with me 
 Motherfuckers had curls and you thought it was all palm trees 
 'Cause you couldn't see 
 The media back then didn't even come with camera men 
 Where gang violence was crackin' in full effect 
 You thought niggas was surfers 
 Never got close enough to see where the dirt was 
 In Oakland, I knew where the turfs was 
 My parents had a plan though 
 And I'm part of the plan, I am hope 
 Dig that, sucker 
 More substance in my bars 
 Than most you niggas on the mic can absorb 
 Sir DzL, the overlord of funk, on the one 
 Showin' West Side support and love 
 Let's work together like the 70's 
 So we can all shine incredibly 
 Straight from the big bad west coast, let's go 
 Straight from the big bad west coast, let's go 
 Straight from the big bad west coast, let's go
