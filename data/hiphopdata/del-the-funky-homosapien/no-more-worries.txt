A-Plus: 
 You don't have to worry any longer... 
 Yo wait a damn, minute 
 Listen to the way the man spin it 
 Even with improper diction 
 I split in and gets ends 
 I'm lettin' suckas know 
 I'm fin ta buck a bro 
 The nigga figga he can dust a pro- 
 Fessional, I test a fool 
 I get a tool 
 And beat him wit it 
 He didn't see me wit it 
 And this is what I'ma do 
 Tie the crime to you 
 Niggas need to find a new rhyme to do 
 I remember when I used to grind a few 
 Indo sacks at my wack Sr. High School 
 But I told the Dean 'Bye fool.' 
 I graduated 
 He was a man I hated 
 And I'm glad I made it 
 Hie-ro 
 I know 
 You know 
 Fools know, that my crew's so 
 Phat, and niggas try to jack 
 Then I know they got my back 
 A-Plus must bust the wack. 
 Casual: 
 I'm fed up with the wackness and this weak shit 
 So peep the style and learn how to freak shit 
 I hope, ya, learn how ta cope 
 By the time you peep this shit here, 
 I'll be three times doper 
 Yeah, this is for the trendy G's 
 To ya bitches, & High School enemies 
 All the hoes 
 Shoot me to the left and shit 
 Cause my financial state was on defecit 
 But I, 
 Really didn't trip 
 Now I'm livin' phatter 
 And then niggas don't matter 
 A lot a rappers try frontin' on me 
 Bet they ain't got nuttin' on me 
 And ain't no way that buck can harm me 
 I turn the mouths of MCs into molecules 
 Niggas locked onto me like my follicles 
 I swallow fools with no regurgitaion 
 We hurt ya face, men 
 When ya placed in my path. 
 Del: 
 I bust asses 
 Ya slow like molasses 
 As this continues 
 Then you know the fastest 
 Computing, looting, I gets the root of things 
 Bitches with problems 
 I leave ya jaw numb 
 I slap hoes 
 My rap flows along 
 With the flow of the song 
 As I flow on the bong 
 I use Jedi mind tricks 
 To find tricks 
 Bind tricks, tie them up 
 Then I try and phuck then they die 
 And what do I care? 
 I dare hoes 
 And prepare flows 'cause I never spare those lives 
 Who strives 
 With knives and slice 
 I parylize ya twice 
 With fear 
 Del is nice to your ears. 
 Snupe: 
 Not of hardest, artists going far 
 Jack off from Jupiter 
 Because I'm shooting for the stars 
 I'm a mack 
 Never come wack 
 Gimme a 30 second snippit 
 I'll rip it 
 Because the shit gets deeper 
 Creep ya ass as the floor rocks 
 We got the beat hittin' hard like four cops 
 Shorts out my last record 
 I write my rhymes nekkid 
 Let me give you a tip 
 I'm on the balls 
 So just expect it 
 My rep gets phatter thinkin' about those kids 
 They tried to step and got phucked like they momma did 
 By the Mr. Mostskill 
 I did ya hoe, still 
 She's askin' for waxin' and taxin' 'cause she heard a hoe squeal 
 Hoes I'm, getting more plays than Showtime 
 The demon got ya screamin' with no shine 
 No time for regular run of the the mill 
 I'm packin' with steel boy soldiers 
 Never no more the soul soldier.
