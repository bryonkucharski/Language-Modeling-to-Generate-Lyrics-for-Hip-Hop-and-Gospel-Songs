(Talking) 
 "A problem? Yeah I got a problem. 
 Cause... I been waitin for how 
 Long for this shit to come out? 
 Now this the tricks and treats shit, ya know? 
 Now all y'all motherphukkers that listen to it, 
 And I'm sick and tired of 
 This shit, because... 
 All you wack motherphukkers keep comin' out with records! 
 And guess what I'm about to do? 
 Guess what I'm 'bout to do?! 
 I'm 'bout to catch you out there... 
 And chopyourmotherphukkinheadoff!" 
 Who's the jester? 
 Under pressure? 
 Not me! 
 I hate emcees a lot, flee 
 Escape, 
 I'll tape your mouth closed 
 Dispose of your flows 
 The ones that you chose 
 Don't compare 
 Where is your other shit? 
 When I discover it 
 I'm shovin that shit 
 Right back in your mouth, 
 And start with another kick 
 Good riddance 
 Suds of blood like the Red Sea splashes 
 When I smash kids 
 Ashes and cremations 
 We wait in 
 The torture chamber 
 Of course you blame a 
 Brother like Del for murder 
 Word up, on a mission 
 It's in my heart 
 Rippin fools apart 
 You dart and dash 
 But I'll remove your heart fast 
 With my bare hands 
 Stashed it into their plans 
 I'd like to see it pulsate in my palm 
 Squeeze it, squish it 
 Eat it with a biscuit 
 For breakfast 
 You're next if 
 You step with 
 Your bright ideas 
 I might apply years 
 Of rhymin 
 Till the time when 
 I blind men 
 With a flash of light 
 I'll blast you right 
 In the corneas 
 I'm warnin ya's 
 So take heed to that 
 Before you bleed, in fact 
 I'm keepin' niggaz outta my head 
 Outta my head 
 Instead, 
 They bled 
 They dead, 
 Call the Feds 
 "This is how you're treated (this is how you're treated) 
 When my rhyme's completed 
 Niggaz get defeated (defeated!)" 
 I wanna push and shove 
 Take off the kid gloves 
 Tearin the terrorist 
 Where a fist 
 Holds a dagger 
 Stick it in your stomach and drag your 
 Insides across the ground 
 Get 'em at the lost and found 
 At the police station 
 I'm patient 
 I won't get you yet 
 So no sweat 
 You're no threat 
 I bet I can belt your brain 
 When my scalpel felt your brain 
 You convulsed 
 No pulse 
 We lost him 
 Cost him his life 
 Phukkin around 
 It's too easy to buck 'em down 
 Let 'em drown 
 Face down in a toilet 
 Take his brain and boil it 
 Watchin who I tell 'cause they'll spoil it 
 They might reveal 
 My anger is real 
 Keep your lips sealed 
 Or yo might be the next to keel over 
 Or Murderous 
 Refer to us 
 When you feel the need 
 To bleed your chicken feed 
 Yeah, plead for mercy 
 Before I burst free 
 I'm blood thirsty 
 When it comes to who disturbs me 
 I make your life complicated 
 Emcees get ground and grated 
 While they waited 
 In the lobby 
 It's my hobby 
 It'll prob'ly be me 
 Who sees your knees 
 Buckle- 
 Phuk you 
 And your duck crew 
 I'ma pluck you from safety 
 When I break free
