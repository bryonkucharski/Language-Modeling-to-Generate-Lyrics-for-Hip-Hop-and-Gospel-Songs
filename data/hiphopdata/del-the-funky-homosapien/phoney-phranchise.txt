This is real hip hop not no phoney phranchise 
 Winnin' by a landslide and you know you can't hide 
 This is D E L not no phoney phranchise 
 Winnin' by a landslide and you know you can't hide 
 This is Hieroglyphics not no phoney phranchise 
 Winnin' by a landslide and you know you can't hide 
 Rag Del, impetuous, tempestuous, 
 My power's activated, have to make it, funky 
 Del deep, scuba diver wet suit who survived to get loose 
 Brewin' in the test tubes to the rescue, extradition process 
 To get you all stressed, step onto my office 
 That's what you call fresh, it's more like some soft breasts 
 If I stopped cess, I probably would cough less 
 Test it, just to see if y'all rested 
 I'm blessin' the beat just like if I was the best man 
 Yo, you miss it in ya' public school district 
 Get a book and do the physics, yo' I got a cool image 
 Like Hendrix, my kindred, y'all fuck up to my index 
 Bench press rappers doing sets with my Syntax 
 Ain't nothin' new motherfucker, man I been black 
 Impact, remember Malcolm X wore a pimp hat 
 You paper chasin' when you make it then you spit that 
 That your whole life shoulda never even been rap 
 Wannabe gangster fool around and get your friend capped 
 Talkin' hella shit my brother trying to buy a ten sack 
 Man, just call me amphibious 
 Submerging so deep yanking curtains on these idiots 
 Walking 'round oblivious more than annoying 
 Everywhere I turn a black life is destroyed 
 And times is getting tough gotta sign for unemployment 
 Walkin' round the town all 'noid and bent 
 Out of posture from sixteen blunts, a pint of vodka 
 Intoxicated some of y'all call it faded 
 With my headphones slammin' playin' Iron Maiden 
 Sleepin' in the lobby of the Days Inn 
 Never outdated 
 When my power's activated, have to make it, funky 
 I'm barn storming, alluring, curing your ailments with lyrical talismans 
 Here it is, for the scrutiny of every record reviewer 
 Your tool to reduce your little rhymes are non existent 
 Meticulous methods I use to modify, the style you all should try 
 Posh poetics, cost effective, neck and neck with sun beams 
 Transcends the fabric of time, yah, it's one thing 
 Named Hiero, habitual funk, fiends and freakerz 
 Techniques from the major leaguers leaves you meager 
 Style malfunctional, I'm punchin' in early 
 Right on schedule gold medalist rebellious 
 (Who?) 
 Del is, got you cornered like a cougar 
 Comin' up with new words like you must be a lummox 
 Wanna infiltrate my crew when you know you'll go nuts 
 Lactose intolerant your bowels'll blow up 
 Catostrophic so deep can't locate with metal detectors 
 Listen more then once you'll need several inspections 
 I'm sicker than a beef recall, reiterate the fact with flows that free fall 
 Reintroduction the classic material, that last with imperial 
 Props and Pop Will Eat Itself 
 Hotter than coals tread and your feet'll melt 
 Like plastic I castrate contenders 
 With a crew that got more power than the Westcoast Avengers 
 Sit and let your ears swim in the splendor 
 This is real hip hop not no phoney phranchise 
 Winnin' by a landslide and you know you can't hide 
 This is D E L not no phoney phranchise 
 Winnin' by a landslide and you know you can't hide 
 This is Hieroglyphics not no phoney phranchise 
 Winnin' by a landslide and you know you can't hide 
 Mouth watering musical madness 
 More bomb than Bombay in glad bags 
 Get mesmerized, spellbound Del found profound 
 Hip hop essentials mandatory for the mental 
 I used to be dazed and confused 
 Now I'm amazed and amused at life and its clever ruse 
 I have compassion while other brothers askin' for trouble 
 Brain damage got 'em befuddle 
 Yo, while I'm on stage pumpin' fear 
 Your over there in the corner drinking non alcoholic beer 
 Dominating, commentating moving on to great things 
 Embracing the lunacy, lacing the community 
 With one, two, and three for all clueless emcees 
 They need guidance, tutorials from the Overlord of skill 
 Magnifying music with my magnificent mind 
 That blinds with such shine it's embarrassing 
 Hop in the caravan with Hiero and hit the road to take care of fans 
 You know what, I'm claimin' dozens, it's Sudden Impact Crib Death 
 It's big threat major counter-act like tazers 
 Trailblazers, we clown the name sayers 
 I crave flavorings with custom tailorings 
 I can communicate with aliens, it's a daily routine 
 It's never failing you fiends to get cream 
 By the continuity the rhymes move in unity 
 Perfectly with the tunes, I hope it hits you soon 
 When my power's activated, have to make it funny
