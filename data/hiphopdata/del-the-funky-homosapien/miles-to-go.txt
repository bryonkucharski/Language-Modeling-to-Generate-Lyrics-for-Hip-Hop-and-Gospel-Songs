This is the intro 
 I dent foes 
 And bend them and upchuck 
 Send ya outta luck phukk 
 That shit is nasty 
 I blast the MC's who try to sneak past me 
 I'm dastardly 
 I scare 'em 
 Dare 'em to maneuver 
 I'm smoother 
 I will prove to all your boys that I do the 
 Psychotic plot if it's necessary 
 Yes it's very down pat 
 Now I'm tellin' brothers brown black lighter 
 Fight for ya righta 
 I incite riots if they try that shit that happen in the 60's 
 I ain'ts the whimpee 
 I simply flip the whip that holds my flow 
 So no foes will know 
 What motivates me 
 I show no race see 
 (See) it's higher 
 Conspiring on MC's who tire me with wackness 
 Using metaphors breaking backs if it comes to that 
 'Cause I'm the one who raps 
 Fillin' gaps in the space 
 Perhaps there's a space for me in the world of rap 
 Your girl's on my lap 
 She's on the dilznick 
 I kill shit 
 The negative feels the musical sedative 
 And I'm ahead of them 
 (Chorus: "I'm goin' tha extra mile, and I bet you smile cause tha 
 Texture's wild, yeah...(Repeat X2)") 
 I only give a little ittle blurb 
 If I prefer to confuse 
 Now were you enthused 
 Just by the way I play with syllables 
 And still I do work 
 'Cause I pursue jerks 
 Till they know I'm berserk 
 Quick with my quirk like Dirk the Daring 
 You can spare me the tears I ain't caring 
 Just preparing for Armageddon 
 Ya head in 
 A guillotine 
 Is sure to thrill a mean 
 Motivation ? ? placed in a casket 
 Drastic 
 You'll get ya ass kicked being placid 
 Ask if I rips suddenly 
 I say what in the hell is you speaking 
 Neva change my strange 
 Way that I come about shit 
 But you doubt it 
 Wanna dis the D-E then you see me and you shout if 
 I would come to you and screw you 
 You new crew 
 And you got the bitch with the mad voodoo 
 Over niggas 
 Because you know the vigor 
 That I use to abuse hoes 
 And foes 
 So get a 
 Whiff of the splif that I'm puffin' 
 Ya wanna step to me in the club 
 But I dubs 
 Nothing (yeah)
