Yeah, that's the funky funky shit, ay bust it, yo, yo 
 Deltron tremendous force to end your courssssse. every whim is 
 Enforced 
 I send men with torches to raid your fortress 
 And in the process radiate your optics 
 Subconsciously haunt emcees 
 Super human technician atomic inner dimension 
 Too mental with intuition 
 Typographical aptitude let my lasers clap at you 
 Mapped the route, psychologically crappin out, what you laughing 
 Bout? 
 Imitations getting penetrated and reassimulated 
 In my emcee training class remain in mass 
 Never get liquidated convert energy 
 Into matter instantly, with a pen and pad 
 Calculate the cenograd, heat the center of gravity 
 Abolish apathy graphically packing 380's 
 With body heat sensitive bullets you need safety 
 Vest on your face and neck 
 Mental armory levitate legs for my monarchy 
 No malarkey my flows embarking 
 Psionically sparking brain cells till they're sparkling 
 No one knows the timepassing by. 
 I remake my universe every time I use a verse 
 To fulfill my destiny, emcees rest in peace 
 Side barriers provide care within 
 From impurities every word sees your attention like third degree 
 I subjugate you other fake performers while the bass of your face 
 No sense you be in attempt fleeting 
 Emcees siphon my likeness 
 Biting my insights like five enchiladas 
 This plain of existence is amazingly different 
 From my orbital oratory always going for the glory 
 You pop wide open from my slice slogans 
 I stay in effect with alien tech 
 Make you wanna say he's the best 
 With synchronization with commendation its armor plated hard to 
 Fake it 
 Never carbonated, scar your matrix 
 Virtually uncertainty, murk your mediocre sheets and sofa 
 With my style of energy, del assembling 
 A realm where anything, is possible 
 NASA scientists can't define this 
 Mechanical mind set diamond alignment 
 Mathematical astro grapple a flow, pterodactyl 
 Very factual crash course, last resort, cast me off 
 At last we warp to my own world, my own neurological cubbyhole 
 Open the airshaft I'll be there fast! 
 With spare raps to tear back their mass 
 Deltron experimental critical literal 
 Professor test the pitiful 
 Micronautalyst interchangeable 
 All of this gamma grammar far from 'Bama 
 Got mind control bandannas 
 To control your clan with scanners 
 Brand the planet like a band of bandits 
 Who man the cannons and guns with random 
 Sub atomic, love of logic, bug with phonics 
 Tub of chronic low in bridle with controlling ciphers 
 Unraveling rhyme, in traveling time 
 Alien life form mail in a pipe bomb 
 Deltoid life long I write songs 
 Monarch absolute, serve a glass of proof 
 When I vanish leave my spirit in a planet 
 On top of the surface my words and wit emerging
