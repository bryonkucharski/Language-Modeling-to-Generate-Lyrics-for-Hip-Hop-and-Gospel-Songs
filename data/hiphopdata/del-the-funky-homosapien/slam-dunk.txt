Pow, watch the crowd go wow While I wild out and pile drive the style Plow a line down the middle Skibby-dee-doo-da-day and make a nigga look cripple But he just enabled by ripple, It's too evident, cleverness will never get you anywhere bitch Not in this game you gotta exchange Quick mane dish the pain and have distance aim I'm blistering like missile command Bristling with the energy as I'm dissin' you man Hieroglyphics this is the brand D-E-L that simply a branch Gifted and swift with the raps Scripted the temperature Black Niggas be twisting the facts But I'lI be getting them back to how original Black Did it with all integrity in tact Then smash the backboard upon impact

 Call me Gerber's just the what they need baby I know it seems crazy how the referee play me You see my team blazing all a bunch a dream-chasers The way I ball I feed the nation cause my team the nation I know it seems courageous but I hope this things contagious/ the faster we apply teamwork we'll be reimbursed You know I'll do something like an alley oop Let my man soak a little bit of the ballyhoo/ I do it dolo too though I'm swift on impulse I dip all in close then bolt Nimble on my toes, I call it pimp mode Take it to the hole Watch the blimp flow in your dental Using fundamentals with the crews motivation Make the losing competition feel like doing something dangerous And we guerilla armed Del he got the killer charm Dish the pill to palm You never know when the shit is on

 All net All bets are off Accept y'all loss when we rep for ours We go extra hard forget the stars The sun shines brighter projects to mars I train all year Brain all clear Feign all fear The gangs all here And we play ball fair Fast break all air More hops than a hare Hip hop is the way I wanna watch You know it's fantastic hands clappingFans chanting the man's anthem It's a jam cram action Everywhere from Oakland to Japan is dancing My brand of rapping some can't imagine So go and catch it live all the stuff I specify areas I specialize in when I bless the mic Cool is the session the message is a festive vibe but still checking on niggas who get too fly
