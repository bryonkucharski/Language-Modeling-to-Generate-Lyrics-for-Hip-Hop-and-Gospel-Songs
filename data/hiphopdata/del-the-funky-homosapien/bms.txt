Ah 
 First day off probation, no wastin' time 
 Just like ancient times, and take a dime and roll it 
 Blaze it with no fear 
 After havin' to take piss tests for a whole year 
 Smokin' with a cold beer makes me kinda think 
 Why I don't like to drink heavily, 'cause what my P.O. was tellin' me 
 'You can't smoke, can't even eat poppy seeds 
 But you can buy liquor, and drink all you need' 
 It's callin' me, I used to drink Heineken's 
 Now it's 'bout 5 or 10, plus wine and gin 
 Hennessy, finishing the last drop 
 To the liquor store was a cash crop 
 Drive right past the grass spot 
 Doin' the dumbest shit I ever did in my life 
 Riskin' my life, 
 Resistin' arrest 
 It's in my flesh 
 Probably smell funny 
 And there go Del's money 
 Fast forward to 1998 
 I smash more herb than those old day's 
 But a whole J to the face? 
 Nah, I'm still feelin' gettin' drunk more than weed 
 But now we back in Amster-D, got some grams for me 
 Chocolate Thai, Purple Haze 
 And blocks of hash that make the J's last for days 
 Rollin' 'em so fat, circumference stuffed with major chronic 
 We can put a wager on it 
 When we first got out here in Europe beer was everywhere 
 Even at the gas station, I was downin' them at 
 A fast pace, when I thought 'This shit ain't helpin' nothin' 
 When I can get elevated straight puffin' nothin 
 (Scratching) Straight puffin' nothin'... 
 (Scratching) Straight puffin' nothin'... 
 (Scratching) Straight puffin' nothin'... 
 The smokin' sessions was the best in the world 
 Plus the price was right, affordable, so more to use 
 So fat they deserve the Kodak 
 And no tax so I'm savin' 
 Not misbehavin' 
 That's a risk we takin', we ain't talkin' bout that 
 We in the outback, smokin' till my mouth's black, how's that? 
 I never fucked up a show being blowed 
 I sorta didn't get it crunk 
 When I was drunk 
 Slow that liquor down boy, hit this BM, Bob Marley 
 A tribute 
 'Cause it was probably as fat as the ones he rolled 
 When he strolled 
 Down the same cobble stone streets 
 With his own beats 
 Another generation, a different time zone 
 With his mind blown, thinkin' up divine poems 
 Blessed by the father and it gets him farther 
 With spiritualities, since it all affects the Karma 
 I used the herb for good purposes 
 Some people are sure to diss, but up in Amsterdam they nurcher it 
 And I can't forget about Crystania 
 This kid is brainia 
 Try to sell hard drugs there then they claimin' ya 
 Life, they only deal with real shit 
 All the bomb and hash you want to deal it 
 And all's well, they don't even sell it for much 
 And the cops don't really touch, 'cause it ain't slangin' dust 
 I'm writin' this, right now under the influence 
 With impudence towards those that say I shouldn't do this 
 Bob Marley'd out, at least till I'm back by the lake 
 But I might roll 1 or 2 for old times sake...
