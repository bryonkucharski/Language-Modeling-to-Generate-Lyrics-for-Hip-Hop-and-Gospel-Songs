We off to the land of funk 
 Where you can damn near do anything you want 
 But take it easy, don't splurge the funk 
 You got the urge to funk, you gotta make it last 
 It's a stone gas, I'm the sworn protector of the nectar 
 I got the juice to get you in the sector 
 Right on, right here 
 Come on, let's go while we in the clear 
 I triumph over chumps and turkeys 
 And obvious squares who work hard to try to jerk me 
 First see self then others, be translucent 
 D did it, maybe they can't do it 
 Wastin' some good funk, gimme that shit 
 I'm taxin' you, bitch, at 75% 
 Next time, keep it like you want it 
 Instead of just wipin' your ass with it 
 And then you feel haunted when it's gone 
 In a song, I define the whole parameter, draw the diameter 
 Cross the county line, now you're found behind funk frontiers 
 You punk Negros don't want none here 
 Au contrair, one snare get my flow beyond air 
 Land, sea, water and fire to the ether world or deeper still 
 With a peek through the veil 
 Frolic with the knowledge that the slumpasaurus exists 
 Just twist your knob to funk and get a whiff 
 Smell that, inhale that, it's in the foliage 
 I'm showin' you the way 'cause lots of fools don't be knowin' this, jeah 
 {Okay, now you gotta get ready for this part 
 (What part?) 
 This one part here, now it start takin' you into this, like ill twist, dig it? 
 (Okay, okay, I dig) 
 Okay we gone, keep movin' through right here 
 (It's, it's creepy) 
 {Quit whinin', we almost there, Foo 
 (This is weird, I feel strange) 
 You're supposed to dig it, just a bar maybe left 
 Okay, okay, jump, here it is, let's go 
 Who are you? We don't know who you are 
 Who told you 'bout our scene? You better start talkin' fast 
 Don't make no sudden moves, we aimin' our funk at you 
 I know you must be spies for the barbarians from outside 
 We're going to funk with you, too late, sucker 
 We off to the land of funk 
 Where you can damn near do anything you want 
 But take it easy, don't splurge the funk 
 You got the urge to funk, you gotta make it last 
 It's a stone gas, I'm the sworn protector of the nectar 
 I got the juice to get you in the sector 
 Right on, right here 
 Come on, let's go while we in the clear 
 What a predicament, you gone and slipped up 
 In a simple mix up but get stuck in the funk 
 And we gotta funk you up one time 
 And you gonna tell us what the funk be on your mind 
 Outside jive jesters always question the healing properties of funk 
 But wanna still walk with a chunk 
 You must be dumb to think you gettin' away scot-free 
 I got the lock and key 
 I preserve the funk for future generations 
 Let 'em know it's the nucleus of new sensations 
 Best to know where you come from 
 'Cause you may have to go back, Kojack 
 But now you didn't know that 
 I know you need a hearing aid 
 Here, take a face full of funk and you can clearly taste 
 The difference in a taste test with the fake mess 
 Perpetrating musical skill 
 Got people so confused due to overkill 
 I'm a little older still, I got a secret 
 Funk keep me beneath the feces 
 Underground, on some deep shit 
 Stress free on the case and then I beat it 
 Without the sequined glove, peep the love 
 In each base throb, I take my job 
 Serious but it's fun to funk 
 I only came to give you what you want 
 Even if you don't know that you want it yet 
 You already peeped game, you just ain't applied it 
 A-plus my guidance counselor, not my sidekick 
 Provided a new form of funk that'll pry open your eyelids 
 Compound 7, now try this special ingredient 
 But don't be greedy, bitch 
 Or we gon' funk you up and that's immediate 
 All rise, fall in line 
 Everybody chime in on time 
 Funk is continuous, funkin' is a function 
 I will honor the the funk 
 The funk is fragile, handle the funk with care 
 It's dynamite, it's outta sight 
 We interplanetary funkin' 
 Light years away from squares and turkeys 
 Funk is a form of communication 
 Funk is power self generated 
 Funk'll keep the lights on 
 P, G and E ain't got nothin' on D 
 P, G and E ain't got nothin' on D 
 Okay, we funkin', willin' and able 
 To funk in the world wide funk federation
