Jeah 
 I got that shit 
 I got that shit that 
 Really work and it fit 
 Like a glove 
 And I be speadin the love 
 I ain't stingy 
 Niggas just gotta get wit me 
 Perfect fit 
 Try it on for size 
 You gone work it 
 Put it on 
 Flaunt it on purpose 
 Make it your own 
 Take it and grow 
 Haters don't know 
 We tried to tell 'em this shit 
 100s of years ago 
 Ok all you mugs lissen up 
 We got a few fools out here 
 Poppin' shit about us 
 I know you heard 
 Same ol' backwards shit 
 By now I know you probably used to it 
 I got news fo them tho 
 Hustlin baby 
 End of discussion 
 Handle it 
 On the goodfoot 
 Movin forward 
 All you niggas who be 
 So full 'o shit 
 I just ignore u 
 Comin' up wit 
 Cures for ills 
 Mysterious fields that 
 Be hoverin 
 I peep and discover them 
 The consequences as 
 The song commences 
 Dumb defenseless 
 Sons of bitches shouldn't tempt this 
 In an instant 
 I will away offences 
 To distances that render 
 Them inneffectual 
 Flow is impeccable 
 Checkin' hoes 
 Disrespectin foes 
 Who don't need no label 
 Call 'em joe shmoe 
 I don't need no label 
 Make my own dough 
 U wanna get in on this 
 Funk then compromise 
 Seein as I'm on the rise 
 The industry's demise 
 I had the foresight to 
 Notice in development 
 Sir DzL 
 He never settle fo less 
 Ghetto express 
 Delivery like federal express 
 Keep the harmony 
 Within confusing boundaries 
 That's my specialty 
 Illusions surrounding me 
 Just be comedy 
 Outdated special fx 
 Cuttin' edge in 1936 
 Most of all I see be 
 Straight up fiction 
 Depictions of mofos 
 Playin' the victim 
 Way too privileged 
 Who be hatin' like bitches 
 Way too suspisious 
 Need to take ur position 
 Out my way mofo 
 Movin through 
 You get an "F" for fired 
 I got it from here jack 
 Your idea of discipline 
 About as dumb as it gets 
 Your mind shallow 
 That ain't as deep as it gets 
 The flow's heat when I spit? 
 Roast mofos plus the 
 Beat to a crisp 
 Ain't no secret to this 
 Sir DzL the 
 Reaper my bitch 
 Ain't no sequel to this 
 Get off my dick and 
 Make ur own sequence of hits 
 I be deep in the abyss 
 Frequently pissed 
 Because you underestimate 
 How I be freakin the gift 
 Completely in bliss 
 Walk around souped like Cambell's 
 Can't tell 
 Or accept 
 I got it goin' on 
 F ur test 
 I walk around 
 Expecially vexed 
 Ready to rep 
 Because I know you petty and pet 
 As in petro 
 Throw you in the death hold 
 Flexin flows 
 Press more than you can tow 
 You go ahead attribute 
 My triumph with flukes 
 Shit again right in yo grill 
 There's the proof 
 Jeah 
 You can't hear me tho 
 I got an eerie flow I know 
 It spook ya 
 Bitch it's the future 
 Get used to it 
 DzL he here to stay 
 Drill funk in yo ear 
 Give you an earache 
 Fear make you tremble 
 Backstab yo own kinfolk 
 That's how you know that the 
 End is close 
 Sir DzL 
 I'm a win the vote 
 'Cause I give 'em hope 
 And your whole intent is to 
 Pimp a hoe 
 You gotta be fuckin' kiddin 
 I will slap the shit outta you mofo 
 Get the fuck outta here 
 I see you think you're 
 Superior in every corridor 
 Where attributes and faculties 
 Kick it 
 But you weak 
 That's the most accurate description 
 And no you don't hear me 
 What I'm sayin' ain't nearly near 
 What it appears to be 
 Handle it 
 Sir DzL 
 Comin' to you live 
 Like a telephone wire layin 
 Out in the street 
 Zzzzt! watch out 
 Here to serve the community 
 With true flow fluidly 
 Ain't nothin' new to me 
 I taught the school to read 
 Now dig that 
 Jeah
