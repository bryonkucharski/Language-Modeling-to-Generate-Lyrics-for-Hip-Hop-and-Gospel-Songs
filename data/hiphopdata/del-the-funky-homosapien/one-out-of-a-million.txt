I deal with the real situations. 
 I'm building, I'm Dzl. 
 I drill it in your grill 
 Till you feel it. 
 Appealing 
 To the realists in society 
 It feel like it's one out of a million 
 But if one of y'all feel it 
 I'm chillin'. 
 Dzl. Do it. 
 That's what it is. 
 Nothing big. 
 Get back 
 Whatever you give. 
 I'm better with this 
 Young wiz 
 How my tongue spit 
 But I let the bums live. 
 Let 'em scrounge 
 Rebound 
 Whatever fall down 
 When I ain't around 
 Out painting the town 
 Making the rounds 
 Haters your loud 
 Mouth will get you straight beat down 
 Making the street to where brothers can't even eat now; 
 That's a cheap foul. 
 My secret vow 
 Is to beat the style 
 Into the hard heads who aren't impressed. 
 Who you know come hard as this? 
 But hard to hit 
 You relegated to the bargain bin. 
 What parts of this 
 Game you don't seem to get? 
 Don't even sweat 
 We could go through the alphabet 
 Z through A 
 Till it's deeply engraved 
 And maybe you could even get paid. 
 But you don't hear me though. 
 [Put pressure on 'em. 
 Just like a zit. 
 Dumbo.]

 Just like an Ice Cube 
 Got game from Ice Cube 
 But really he's a nice dude. 
 Thanks to sir Jinx 
 'Cause he the one who had the right tools 
 To light the fuse 
 When I took the mike and went kaBOOM! 
 Duck down 
 Structures crumble to the ground 
 When I touch down 
 Ain't much cluckers could say now. 
 Rap is my playground 
 Straight from the bay 
 My sound represents every color from beige to brown. 
 It's weighted down 
 So it's hard to snatch 
 You carbon copy cats is barred from rap. 
 Guard your hat 
 'Cause there she blows 
 When my nefarious flows 
 Go where music rarely goes. 
 Stereo 
 Balance both sides of the fence 
 Pretty much on as live as it gets 
 When I'm in the midst 
 Dzl 
 You don't deserve 
 Nothing less than my 
 Potent words. 
 Read it on paper so you 
 Know for sure 
 No BS you see I got it sewn like a seamstress. 
 You typical fool 
 This is old news 
 You already know 
 You got that when you rolled through. 
 Shut up! 
 Learn how to learn before you start trying to take terms, sucka! 
 You diamond head sucker, you.

 Swerving through the bay with the top down 
 Keep the urban view 
 It take a bit of courage to avoid the holes 
 Employ your goals 
 'Cause lost souls talk monkey wrenches 
 When you're comfy sitting 
 Humpty Dumpty didn't 
 So he cracked up; 
 Couldn't quite get it 
 Back together he was backed up 
 Couldn't get on top of his business 
 That was piled up. 
 And the miserable 
 The ones who did it the dude 
 Just smile like "Isn't he cute?" 
 Watch your step 
 'Cause they showed out to cross your rep. 
 That's game 
 And it won't cost you zip 
 Straight from the lip of me, Dzl, 
 That's D-Z-L. 
 The big deal 
 I'm behind door number three 
 And you nonpracticing 
 Platinum chain () 
 Lying to broads for coochie credit 
 Bozos 
 You don't want it with me 
 Mister D-E-L 
 One plus one is two 
 I don't care what you do 
 Forget the philosophical topics foo 
 Think it's a game 
 So foos popping at you 
 That's the thing they ain't taught you in school 
 But I ain't where you from 
 "But what, what state you from?" 
 State of consciousness 
 You from the state of nonsense I gather. 
 Laugh and tease buzzard 
 Then you get home and count how much money you got 
 All together turkey, total. 
 You need a hearing aid.
