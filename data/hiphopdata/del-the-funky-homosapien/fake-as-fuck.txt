If you're brown nosin' in the industy (you fake as fuck) 
 Wanna pretend that you're a friend to me (you fake as fuck) 
 Funny style record companies (you fake as fuck) 
 Weak ass MC wannabe's (you fake as fuck) 
 You know I gotta handle my sponsatility 
 Along with pillaging of the crusade of the rhythm seas 
 A million reas 
 Like ziplock 
 I seal and freeze 
 Better than stealin' keys 
 Or killin' sprees 
 You ain't worth a hill of beans ratio 
 To the text I toggle and tilt 
 Best taste is bottlin' milk 
 The model of filth 
 Who's the nastiest? 
 Who would ever ask me this? 
 You better aqueous 
 Before you take half a step 
 Eager like a bachelorette 
 With a lack of respect 
 Like a youth packin a tech 
 The whole attraction is death 
 Plethoras electra to bisto 
 Come to my creep show 
 To logic is lethal 
 I repo ya flow 
 Recucitate 
 Reanimate 
 So now it's a candidate 
 Most likely to laminate 
 In other words who wanna get served? 
 I'll hand a plate with a heaping helping 
 You'll be belchin' 
 No one's tellin' 
 While you chokin' you're eye's are open 
 Acupunture a private pokin' 
 And I ain't jokin' 
 Why this evenin' I feel like cryin free men 
 Rhyme and reason mixed with violent feelin's 
 Anything that I could squeeze in to make you descend 
 At a rate that's sure to agitate 
 Like you bought a bag of shake 
 My mind's a data place 
 Plus a batter's box 
 That'll regulate your whiney boos like I'm Donahue 
 I'm Omney calmly bombing your Brownstone 
 Till the cow's home 
 Well endowed poems 
 Crash through the embassy 
 Disrupt the assembly 
 Dislocate your whole fake industry 
 Horrendously 
 If you're brown nosin' in the industy (you fake as fuck) 
 Wanna pretend that you're a friend to me (you fake as fuck) 
 Funny style record companies (you fake as fuck) 
 Weak ass MC wannabe's (you fake as fuck)

 Okay, let's start 
 Child birth the rhyme and leave stretch marks 
 Etch art with text darts 
 The cardiac arrest arch 
 The next stop is where I shop at the fresh mart 
 Sale of ale and all the bomb you want 
 There's no counterpart 
 Take my rhyme around the park 
 And piss on you like a hound to bark 
 Down to spark blee's and all 
 Unbelievable 
 I see through walls 
 With evil galls 
 I feed 'em balls 
 Agent of derangement 
 Entertainment tainted 
 Wit insane 
 It's flagrant 
 Foul fragile famous cadence 
 You'll never make it to day break 
 Save face 
 You just a grey space 
 I lay waste 
 Rated with frangrance rancid 
 I can't miss it 
 Enhanced mits allow me to advance quick 
 With antics you tamper with your trustees 
 I bust these as rapidly as slush freeze 
 You must need parental guidance 
 Your mental's out of alignment 
 My mind set is the finest 
 The pen let you jack off too often 
 While you sleepin' she contaminate your sperm and offspring 
 I offset any threat to my nature 
 Face you with eight flares and a saber 
 Pave ya till I hit paved dirt 
 While you blaze dirt 
 I flame the greenest bomb 
 Fool, I better never see your palm 
 You peeping tom 
 I'ma need the force of my whole crew to keep me calm 
 I sneak a bomb to your mesa 
 Disgraced ya 
 Waste ya 
 Leave a stain the size of Asia 
 Imperial premier poet 
 My perch could never be usurped 
 For mere syllable serfs 
 Take it for gospel like you hear in in church
