{Ladies and gentlemen, rap fans of all ages 
 Tonight we have a literal state of pandemonium 
 As Sir DzL, aka Joe Higashi, makes his way to the ring 
 As you can see 
 You can almost taste the electricity in the air, ladies and gentlemen} 
 {The challenger had better live up to the trash 
 He was talking at the press conference two nights ago 
 Or it looks like he'll be leaving the ring fingerless 
 After Higashi's signature scissor kick 
 Oh, this is gonna be a good one, rap fans} 
 I'm back with the tiger kick 
 Joe Higashi, all team activist of spit swivel grip 
 Crippling blows within editions of flows 
 It's a gala of gargantuan proportions 
 The greatest show in stereo 
 The weary ol' drag you been hearin' is dead 
 We playin' funk at the burial grounds and it's a merry ol' sound 
 And a jolly good time when we body fools with rhymes 
 Smell the burnin' flesh when the words of death 
 Bring eternal rest or internal stress 
 Beef or chicken, either way the meat is sickened 
 Bacteria, we here in your kitchen 
 Fools hearin' but they clearly don't listen 
 Until they sittin' in a twister on they way to Oz 
 And that's when I'mma holla at y'all 
 'Cause you gon' need the wizard's expertise 
 If you expect to leave 
 Sir Di, the midnight savior spittin' my flavor 
 Gettin' my paper, neighbor 
 To catch a tiger, you have to try a little harder 
 I already commandeered you cargo 
 Sir D-Z, the blue meanie, few see me 
 A new species like ET 
 I'm too pretty 
 I can't let you hit me 
 I'm the greatest of all time 
 Sir DzL, King Of Fighters 
 Bring on your bigmouths, bring on your writers 
 They gon' be workin' overtime catchin' arthritis 
 Bring whoever do ya hooks, bring your choirs 
 Bring on your phony thugs, they all liars 
 Makes no difference to Di, I'm on fire 
 Funky with it, go ahead, touch me 
 I'm beggin' you, come try to rush me 
 You weak kid, soon as the beat kick 
 You already in deep shit, may as well eat it 
 Put your money where your mouth is 
 In other words, you are what you eat so bon appétit 
 So long to competition, they can't conquer 
 Or defeat or compete, I stomp out they teeth 
 All 32, metaphorically with words I use 
 Physical? I ain't finna get into that right now 
 Keepin' on the right route, promote restraint 
 Power in the pictures you paint 
 Go ahead, wear your stunnas at night 
 All the better you don't see me comin' with the right 
 Then it's the flash of light 
 From the Polaroid captured right 
 In your brain, then it's beddie bye 
 Thought you could chump me like I'm just any guy 
 Off the street and got comfy 
 Underestimated, now you on the other extreme 
 And got me under investigation 
 To see why Di ain't nothin' to play with 
 Nathan, no leads 
 Only thing he gon' see is me punchin' bags 
 Beats danglin' like cuts and slabs 
 Joggin' in place doin' rhythm repetitions 
 That'll have you jaw fall out your face 
 You got a mouth that's out a shape, you loud and fake 
 Stick around and wait for me to drown you in poundin' bass 
 A boomin' system causin' you to listen 
 Like you in prison 
 Now you lay down by my feet 
 Pray the Lord you get up in a week 
 Sir DzL, King Of Fighters 
 Bring on your bigmouths, bring on your writers 
 They gon' be workin' overtime catchin' arthritis 
 Bring whoever do ya hooks, bring your choirs 
 Bring on your phony thugs, they all liars 
 Makes no difference to Di, I'm on fire 
 Funky with it, go ahead, touch me 
 I'm beggin' you, come try to rush me 
 Each fool tryin' to reach through 
 Is gon' need new fingers when the guillotine sweep through 
 Tissue and bone with a scissor kick to the dome 
 Lifted you as if you were floatin', fight officially over 
 And if it ain't, you gon' wish it was over 
 As I issue a cobra clutch shuttin' your motor 
 Skills down like a computer crash, takin' you to the task 
 Rhymes ricochetin' all through your ass 
 The movement is black 
 Already told you it's been proven with fact 
 How I do it like a student of rap 
 Musically adapt to any nuisance or trap 
 Produced by crackpots 
 Thinkin' that they have a shot 
 If they can just put DzL on freeze 
 But cease 
 I'm Joe Higashi with flow karate 
 Wrestling gators is a old hobby 
 Now I battle cobras and eat poison ivy 
 Shit, jalapenos on the open highway 
 Which hit like a meteor eatin' your established mind state 
 How can I lose? My standards are too high 
 For fools to view, punchin' my kneecaps 
 With the weak raps that you so proud of not writin' down 
 I don't care who like it 
 Obviously style is not a part of the criteria or they not hearin' it 
 It's disposable and holds no real substance 
 So as soon as you step in the ring, it's self destruction 
 Sir DzL, the championship belt you wanted 
 I'm meltin', fuck it 
 Bottoms up, it's just a puddle in a bucket 
 A pot of slush 
 Yeah 
 Fuck the material shit 
 He can't beat me 
 He ain't got the spirit for this 
 Plus he ugly and his mouth too big 
 But this gon' be nationwide 
 Publicly publicized 
 You betta hope I knock you out 
 So you ain't gotta go through the hostile rounds 
 My tiger kick'll make your eyeballs flip 
 My hurricane uppercut'll send you to Oz 
 And while you there, you can ask the wizard 
 If he can give you a job 
 They call me Joe Higashi 
 You can catch my flow on Hitachi 
 Wide screen, you gon' see how I lean with it 
 And roll with it 
 Ol' nigga, they gon' be mad 
 Oh, it's over that quick? I bought 4 tickets 
 So I'm gonna give you the whoopin' 
 You been sayin' I couldn't 
 Soon as they strike the bell 
 You gon' lose all sight and smell 
 You already deaf 'cause your music sucks 
 So only thing left is your sense of touch 
 No, sucker, you lost your sense of taste long ago 
 And I can tell at that ugly ass getup you wore to the show 
 I'm too pretty, I can't let you hit me 
 I'm the greatest of all time
