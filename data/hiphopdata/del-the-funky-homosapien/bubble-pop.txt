This goes out to my peoples who I love a lot Del with another hot joint named Bubble Pop It's just me commentating on helium heads who be hating, I'm deflating Building a rep from game innovation Still in effect they feel penetration Peeling them back like a tall sealing a crack Mind state kind of militant black So, I'm willing to back whatever I say with acts While suckas play favorites or play the back/ Lick ass for a scheme to get past go But I'ma let them stroll down the golden road And you know they hate it when they find out the bricks is gold and plated I told you ancient ass niggas you can't even hold your weight in proportion in weight, there's more son Cause niggas really don't care if you a thug they or not This is Del and the jam is the bubble pop 
 Why do you think that you are all that? Cause you ain't 
 Why do you think that you are all that? Cause you ain't 
 Why do you think that you are all that? Cause you ain't, motherfucka 
 Yeah that's the way is goes Diesel from the the land of the Raiders holmes You played yourself trying to fade the Del - fonica any lyric that you comment on Cause niggas will say damn, you kinda dumb I'm too sly and cunning 100 miles and running, on diesel power So see you cowards I'm pleasing thousands but you ain't leaving housing Stop the evil frowning ask your people to teach you countenance While I create beats to keep you bouncing With aftershocks that eat through mountains Since the 70's my pedigree get cheddar cheese When I used to read Jets and Ebony's I bet I reach even the hardest g's Cause my artistry ain't to hard to see Stay far from me D love the bop D-Bo wanna see your bubble pop 
 Why do you think that you are all that? You ain't 
 Why do you think that you are all that? You ain't 
 Why do you think that you are all that? You ain't, motherfucka 
 Yeah, I go coo coo for afro puffs In blue jeans with a massive ass be stuffed I come to see lovely honey's that's what's up Not you money hungry hoes who be fast as fuck You're ass is stuck in la la land The next morning talking about how dry I am Tell people I'm mean, damn right I am But what you like so bad is that I'm like your dad A hoe will compromise themselves for pleasures they want at the time Do anything for anybody Now you tell me who's really sorry You used to have an appealing body Till you let niggas ride the wheels off the trolley You probably feel that you're still not a harlot You see me and then you feel all retarded Hoes will sell your love for knots a dub what Get yo bubble popped, bitch 
 Why do you think that you are all that? You ain't (Repeat 4x) 
 Del ad-lib with the chorus
