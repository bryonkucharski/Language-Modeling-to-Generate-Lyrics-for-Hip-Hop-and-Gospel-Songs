Part 1: FWA--Fair Weather Associates: 
 Fair weather associates 
 You better, watch how close they get 
 It's the, fair weather associates 
 You better, watch how close they get 
 It's the, fair weather associates

 (Del) 
 We all know FWA's, how they lay 
 'Cause they figure if you're bumpin the pays 
 In the long run, and it's all fun in their eyes 
 They must be on one how, they prepare lies 
 Get up close make you think, you the host of the ceremonies 
 Why you ain't peepin like a doggy mark his territory 
 They're never there for me when I need a little boost 
 Because of who you are, they can get a little juice 
 Then they like to seemingly leans up on your shoulders 
 Otherwise he's steppin on toes gettin' over 
 Flappin his molars talkin' 'bout he owe you 
 And every time he smoke, he don't show you no love 
 And be the first fool with his lips on the blunt 
 If he persists to front I'ma commenced to dump 
 Be careful when you make a little something that's yours 
 Cause a lot of these predators want yours to be theirs 
 Or at least own a share just by bein there 
 I be on some hermit skit, and fools think I'm square now 
 There's an interesting way to look at it 
 I look at them as bein fake, the way they took advantage 
 Speaking on the crooks of the planet, who claim they got game 
 Yeah you the game and they the hunter; just one more 
 Fair weather associates 
 You better, watch how close they get

 "Shit Talkers" part two of "Pet Peeves": 
 Hey whassup man, this is D-E-L once again 
 I'm here to tell you a little story about this motherfucker 
 Who keep runnin' his big ass mouth 
 You don't know me, motherfucker 
 Shut your ass up, 'fore I slap the lips off your motherfuckin face 
 Man, you got a big ass mouth! 
 You know what? 
 (Del) 
 Fools is hella talkative, saying how I walk and live 
 Always trying to start the kid, wishin that we all can give 
 A small interview, just a subterfuge 
 Wanna hook up with you so they can say 'whatchu do' 
 Get your own life, live your own legacy 
 Why you wanna spread my rees, talking 'bout my girls pregnancy 
 Professor, I guess you never learned your lesson 
 When you saw me out drinkin' at the bar, 
 You said I was sexin this other ho 
 Chuck D, what a brother know 
 About my beeswax, runnin' off with your feedback 
 Who I smoked weed with? Who I smoked crack with? (false) 
 How I sexed every girl you know without no prophylactic 
 Fool, I'll be in the house and that's it 
 On the rap tip or studyin, unlike you 
 You quite new, no game 
 I understand you a youngster, wanna be hustler 
 Undercover buster 
 Can't believe I trusted ya - but that goes to show 
 How fools fold getting jelly off the dough, yo! 
 (Del's imitation) 
 "Del's rich Del's bitch got zero, cause Del's a hero, 
 Del's a weirdo because he do heroin" 
 (Del) 
 Ain't got no idea where Teren's been 
 I should take it to pugilism so 
 I can fuse your vision with some realness 
 Instead of these fake phony stories you be glorifyin 
 Don't you know that many more are dyin'? 
 From the fatal disease, called runnin' them choppers 
 In front of females, or on front of the coppers 
 You only do this shit cause you be wanting your propers 
 Somebody's gonna get steamed and run up and pop ya 
 You exercise your choppers really, choo choo choo 
 You exercise your choppers off some brand new news 
 Your molars bite, your canines tear, whether it's false or true 
 You exercise your choppers like some gossipin fool 
 You know what? 
 You get your little notices from bumpin your gums 
 When you should be concentratin on lumpin your sums 
 Got to show your little ass when company comes 
 Cause We From The Crew That You Wanna Be From 
 You get your little notices from bumpin your gums 
 When you should be concentratin on lumpin your sums 
 Got to show your little ass when company comes 
 Cause We From The Crew That You Wanna Be From! 
 Biotch!

 Are you gonna live your whole life with blindness on your eyelids? 
 Pretty boys fakin like they grinders 
 (Del) 
 First off, you a buster so mind us 
 On the street with your crack thinkin' you're a timer 
 Co-signin, findin it ain't workin 
 Fiends is perkin, I seen you on Perkins 
 Fools chirpin around the blocks with glocks 
 And you, really ain't ready for the plot they got 
 It's unbelievable the way the leave your skull on the pavement 
 Snatch up your scrilla as soon as you made it 
 You could be layin dead, instead you play dead 
 So they would quit whoopin your ass; you get, put in the past 
 Tryin' to keep up with the Jones' like the mass

 (Del) 
 You bite somebody's style, it's invitin like a child 
 You cling to it; I hear it, hmmm 
 It's got a ring to it - if that's your thing do it 
 At least you claim you ain't down with that hiphop shoobeedoobee 
 Which is fine cause my click say you booty 
 You a white kid, your mom said I'm a mooley 
 Now you talking 'bout pass the doobie and the toolie 
 Got your raps and your gat pointed at yours truly 
 Talking 'bout you gonna school me, who me? 
 Here's a little jewel like a ruby 
 Since you talkin' like you knew me 
 Playing a role that's straight out a movie 
 Acting unruly, and your neighbors call SO-WEEE 
 To the pigs then they fling you in the brig 
 Leave gang bangin' to the real gat holders 
 Or real black soldiers who you don't know of 
 Who don't show love with all you sun and your thun 
 'Cause they know where you from, 
 You from Oakland, you rich and you ain't from the slums 
 Your pops is a politician 
 So why bein a criminal is your three wishes 
 Used up, do what comes naturally 
 Quit playing a role that don't even have to be 
 You slippin 
 (Poser 2) 
 "Dude, I ain't slippin, man I'm from the town too, 
 Man I'm from the Oakland hills dude.
