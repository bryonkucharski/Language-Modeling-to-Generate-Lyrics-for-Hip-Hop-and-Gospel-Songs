Let the buyer beware 
 And prepare for the scare of 1991, yo 
 Brothers get dumb without no remorse, yo 
 Gas they hand and then they thrown off course, yo 
 I coulda told ya so 
 I'm no dummy 
 Girls out there will act funny for the money 
 If ya rollin' in dough, she'll treasure ya 
 Instead of a pager 
 She carries a cash register 
 It's cool for the fool that just happens 
 To be a crack dealer or rappin' 
 Back in the day 
 It wasn't no problem 
 Cause it was ok, to just have a job then 
 But, nowadays ya gotta have the status 
 But, natives ain't goin' for the madness 
 Hey, they barely outta their teens 
 16 and 17 year olds livin' like queens 
 Cause, honey trips without the checks 
 And ayo 
 Money trips without the sex 
 So next is somethin' that natives don't need 
 Headaches and heartaches 
 And I refuse to partake 
 In money for sex 
 In any form or fashion 
 All ya hopes and dreams I'm like smashin' 
 And I know otha brothas know how I feel 
 So you can step cause (it ain't no big deal), 
 "Money for sex, money for sex, ring it up..." 
 Where, oh where did the good girls go? 
 It seems all that's left in the Meadow is hoes 
 Not the kinda hoe that you use in your garden 
 Yes the kinda hoe that'll make your dick harden 
 But it's more than a dolla for a holla 
 And more than a thousand for a peak up her blouse, and 
 More than a million if ya have children 
 Cause nowadays girls wanna make like a killin' 
 So babies come in handy 
 And they'll just eat up your dough like candy 
 Give her some Brandy 
 And let her roll around in the Benz 
 And she'll give up the crotch and brag to all her friends 
 Thinkin' they can play me like a field trip 
 That's why I slugged my honey dip 
 Cause that's more than I can stand 
 And I'm the man who sets it right again 
 Bust they in the lip 
 And the bitch will never bite again 
 You ain't gettin' with my nubain brothers 
 Cause before you even hit them covers 
 I warned 'em 
 Told 'em what was up before you bitches even swarmed him 
 'Cause they'll be next 
 If I didn't hip my brothers to the sex 
 So you can try to rob and steal 
 But we were right on ya heels because (it ain't no big deal), 
 You say crack sellers are swell fellas 
 Takin' you to school in his 5.0 
 Like I don't know that your boyfriend is paid 
 Ya musta told me 18 times, the other day 
 Bamboo earings and gold teeth 
 And I know you must be givin' up the whole piece 
 He's just payin' for the sex 
 And I know you prostitutes is playin' with the sex 
 So who's next? 
 Don't think that you can play the Homosapien 
 'Cause I got plenty of friends that's like waiting in the trenches 
 And I know your intentions 
 You wanna be down with a rapper 
 So you clap your 
 Thighs around my legs like a sandwich 
 But I'm not famished 
 Your schemes and plots are outlandish 
 Tan is the color of my skin, but 
 False is the color of your grin 
 So you can't win 
 This ain't no joke 
 And honey dip you can quote 
 Note for note 
 And squeal like a billygoat 
 And tell your friends that Del is stuck up 
 But in reality 
 You phucked up 
 Now nubians ain't givin' money for the sex 
 And ayo 
 Nubians ain't givin' money for the sex 
 You stuck out in the cold 
 Like a mole on my asshole 
 Cause brothers ain't givin' up another red cent for the sex 
 Now, don't you look foolish? 
 Ya gold diggin' ass looks goulish 
 Pale as a ghost cause ya post high like a man is a big wheel 
 Because (it ain't no big deal).
