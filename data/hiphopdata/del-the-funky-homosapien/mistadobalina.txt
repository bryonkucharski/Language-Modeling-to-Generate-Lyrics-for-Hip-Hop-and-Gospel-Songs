 Mistadobalina Mistabobdobalina Mistabobdobalina won't you quit 
 You really make me sick with ya fraudulent behavior 
 You're gonna make me flip and then an army couldn't save ya 
 Why don't you behave ya little rugrat 
 Take a little tip from the tabloid 
 Because I know I'm not paranoid 
 When I say I saw ya tryin' to mock me 
 Now you and your crew are on a mission tryin' to hawk me 
 But it isn't happenin' ya fraudulent foes 
 You used to front big time now I suppose 
 That everything's cool since the style of apparel you adopted 
 You used to make fun of but now you wanna rock it 
 So you gotta kick it with the homies 
 But D-E-L is already hip to your cronies 
 Me and CM-PX thought about this and never have we seen a 
 Brother who could look like Mista Mista Mistadobalina 
 Ooh ooh Mistadobalina 
 You thought ya could manipulate 
 You thought you could fool me 
 Ooh ooh Mistadobalina 
 Changes put me on a stump and then he schooled me 
 Friends can be fraudulent just you wait and see 
 First he was my moneygrip 
 Then he stole my honeydip 
 Mistadobalina is a serpent 
 Don't you agree the little two-tima 
 Resembles Aunt Jemima 
 With jeans and a dirty white hoodie 
 Seems like he wouldn't be a snake 
 Or wouldn't disguises come in all sizes and shapes 
 Notice the facade of the snakes 
 They all catch the vapes 
 Even though last year they was GQ 
 Took a little time before the D-E-L could see through 
 The mask all I had to do is ask the heather wall Akwame 
 And my man responded they would bomb a 
 Fraudulent foe with the strength of Hercules 
 The way ya on my dick must really hurt ya knees 
 You need to take heed and quit being such a groupie 
 Ever since I did a little show in Guadeloupee 
 I neva saw a groupie like you 
 But what is funny is ya wanted to be down with my crew 
 But D-E-L is not down with any clowns or jesters 
 So I would suggest that ya try to impress Uncle Fester 
 Dobalina because ya don't impress me 
 Dobalina the style of dress is not the key 
 Dobalina it's all in the mind and the heart 
 So you should start 
 By remembering ya gotta pay a fee dobalina
