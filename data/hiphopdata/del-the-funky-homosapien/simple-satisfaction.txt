I'mma keep it alive, the funk 
 With this 'lil special device, the funk 
 It works for me, what's that, the funk 
 Lemme flip the switch and get it started, the funk 
 Try to go against the funk, you're finished 
 You gone substitute, you're finished 
 DZL, funk from the beginning to the 9th inning 
 And my team is winning, homeboy, you're finished 
 Sir D, dirty wordsmith, poetry perfect 
 So serious with the lip service 
 Somebody get him a mop 
 Properly sop up this mess left by the previous guests 
 Yes, that's an order from the lord of the funk continuum 
 Any fool disagree, send me 'em, I'll attend to 'em 
 Quick, fast, leave his ass, pickin' through the trash 
 Lightning bolt voltage, extra watts 
 Add pressure to your box, tell it to stop 
 But Del is a rock, unmovable juggernaut 
 Astronaut but on the asphalt with my rap vault 
 Now open to the public for observation 
 Admiration of how we used to play it 
 Daze and amaze with flow 
 Any engagement is like a wedding reception 
 Hope you get a reception 
 Don't miss out on this fresh cut, jeah 
 Tried to told you 
 I visualize with mind of Minolta, definin' the culture 
 Move with it, groove with it, body and soul connect 
 We 'bout to perfect the action 
 For simple satisfaction 
 That come from sayin' that we did it 
 You ain't with it then don't, I don't care 
 You just miss the boat 
 Hitler? Nope, DZL, leader of the funk people 
 And I'mma see you 'cause funk or die 
 That was the promise so 
 Deep but wear my heartbeat on my sleeve 
 Let it vibrate the signal leads 
 To the thing you need to cling to, to believe 
 I'mma tell you that it's real, I had to feel 
 Not in the sense of sensual touch 
 But you can tell the difference when you gettin' the rush 
 Not drugs, not to fuck of your buzz 
 But this came before the additives 
 Nigga, I'm bad and big, come test it 
 Words leave you heard, no further suggestions 
 Swerve to a session in less than half an hour 
 I got a pad with paragraphs of power, now you're devoured 
 You ain't allowed to talk 'cause you foul and false 
 Mouthin' off like a child of God 
 But you get beat down with freestyles 
 'Cause you're cheap style 
 Don't even need to be out, believe me it's wild 
 Uncontrollable, foldin' you like a bank roll 
 Jeah, takin' control, I'm back with Zac 
 Crackin' your wig back with that counter-attack 
 For that counterfeit bought over the counter shit 
 I got thousands of scripts from down in the pit 
 Deep underground where the system crank 
 Causin' earthquakes, you heard it reverberate 
 I'm sure that you can relate 
 If you're funky there's no further debate 
 Move with it, groove with it 
 On ya mark and get set, go 
 'Del the funky homosapien' once again 
 Sometimes from the end to the beginning 
 If you can smell the fragrance, tell them dunces 
 Don't say shit, you must be out your mind 
 Crazy like a bag of sprayed weed 
 They way out your league, better leave it to the big boys 
 Jeah, deep in the land of funk, funk or die 
 That was the promise so 
 Deep in the land of funk
