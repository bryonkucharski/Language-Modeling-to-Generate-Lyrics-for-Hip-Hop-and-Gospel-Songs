(Feat. Casha) 
 Yung Berg 
 Casha 
 Let's go 
 (Chorus: Casha) 
 So many times 
 You and I 
 Makin' luv through the night 
 The way that you make me feel 
 From the wrong to the right 
 All the pain you and I 
 You know dat I'm down for real 
 If you (only knew) 
 If you (only knew) the things you can make me do 
 If you (only knew) 
 If you (only knew) 
 The way dat I feel for you 
 Yung Berg: 
 It goes fressher than whoever 
 Shawty you a star 
 Must of fell straight from heaven 
 She landed in my car 
 Standin by the bar 
 Conversation smart 
 Felt like my first time 
 Hittin 106th in park 
 Back [? ] 
 Legs super thick 
 You know the type you can't wait to go spread apart 
 Had her from the start 
 Took it to the waist 
 Where her top came down 
 For I throw it out of car 
 And still to this day 
 I hop into the gucci man 
 Records on the radio 
 Like I'll do anything (for you) 
 So tell me what am I to do 
 I know this song changed 
 So I let this song play (for you) 
 Yeah show cancelled the first season 
 No martin no gena 
 Yes only diddy 
 For you mami 
 I'm right here will you need to be 
 And when I lost you I lost a piece of me
