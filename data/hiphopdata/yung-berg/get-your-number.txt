(Feat. Amerie) 
 Listen I know we been through our 
 Ups and downs but you cheated and broke 
 My heart I gave you a second chance 
 But you never gave up so... well I'm going 
 To sing to ya to get you to understand 
 Baby listen up it's sad news 
 Ooh! Yeah

 But what you did to me really broke my heart 
 And babe I know your sorry and I forgive you 
 But we just gotta just be friends so don't act 
 Like you don't know so ya know what

 Desbite all the ups and downs our love was fun
