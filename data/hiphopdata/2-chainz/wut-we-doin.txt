 I am gettin' to the money 
 Crocodile dundee 
 VIP at the bank, I can go on Sunday 
 At the strip club, two girls in front of me 
 Bend over hut one, hut two, hut three 
 Polo on my drawers, Polo on my shirt 
 I put Polo on your bra bitch, that Polo, Polo, Polo 
 Every time you see me takin' photo after photo 
 At the red light nigga photo after photo 
 Stretch to impress, snow on my chest 
 I don't like her if she got a 'fro between her legs 
 I'm a real nigga, and bitches like real 
 So you is what I ain't and it is what it is

 Whoa kemosabe, smokin' is my hobby 
 Whoa kemosabe, big ballin' is my hobby 
 Whoa kemosabe, I'm matter in the lobby 
 Then I took her to my room and I got that sloppy toppy 
 No matter what I'm doing, no matter where I'm going 
 I am so far ahead I'll see you niggas in the morning 
 Two chains on my first chain started cloning 
 If I die tonight I got a bank roll on me 
 Versace, cheese on my broccoli 
 Gold rollie on all you watchin' all my watches 
 Stretchin' out like pilates 
 Wash it in my condo, suicide doors 
 Rest in peace to my car door

 Look, I am gettin' to that paper ma I'll see you later 
 Let the top back all you see is gator 
 Bad bitch with me got my name on her 
 She got the five purse pussy got the change on her 
 All I do is fuckin' rap and rap and fuck some groupies 
 Fuck her with the camera rollin' make a fuckin' movie 
 Everywhere I go I'm strapped got that fuckin' tooly 
 Shout out to all my niggas in the hood, every city that I roll I'm gucci 
 Whole team with me, spinnin', two liter sprite, OZs in it 
 Double cuppin' then double up got another chick she want to come for lunch 
 Got a best friend I made her roll up the blunts, don't do that check and let the ho get choosin' 
 South side nigga, ho we coolin'
