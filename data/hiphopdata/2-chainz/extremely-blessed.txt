Baby let's roll away 
 Get lost in the day 
 I love that you love what you do 
 And just like any other girl, baby I'll love you the same 
 I know you gotta go, the DJ is calling you to the stage 
 Go ahead baby, do your thing 
 Honey complexion 
 Body of a goddess 
 22s on the Lexus, named Alexis 
 By the way of Texas 
 Big face Rolexes 
 While she's undressing, man I'm stressing 
 She's extremely blessed, extremely blessed 
 Extremely blessed, extremely blessed 
 Extremely blessed, extremely blessed 
 She's extremely blessed, extremely blessed 
 Give us this day our daily bread 
 If you a chicken head, go somewhere and lay some eggs 
 I make you, make your bed, take that head 
 I got a move that'll break your leg, know what I'm talking about 
 Known to kill pussy, nigga chalk it out 
 Our first date was the Waffle House 
 Different day, different escapades 
 If they don't like it they opinion like Escalade's 
 Everybody got one 
 Honey complexion 
 Body of a goddess

 While she's undressing, man I'm stressing 
 She's extremely blessed, extremely blessed 
 Extremely blessed, extremely blessed 
 Yeah 
 She slow grinded the whole time 
 I told her have a seat, you sitting on a gold mine 
 Big ass, long hair, thick thighs 
 Eat lobster tail like French fries 
 I'm the type to buy you a car for the fifth time 
 This skinny nigga doing big time 
 Oh wait, dinner dates I demonstrate how to penetrate 
 If you ain't wit' it, then it's elimi-date

 Extremely blessed, extremely blessed 
 Extremely blessed, extremely blessed 
 She's extremely blessed, extremely blessed 
 Baby let's roll away 
 Get lost in this day 
 Say it's okay 
 Come to me 
 Extremely blessed, extremely blessed
