(Okay) Free Tunechi, Yeah 
 2 Chainz! Hey, Hey, Hey 
 I got a bad bitch, she more than cute 
 And bitch I'm balling, I'm talking more than hoops 
 This is that fish scale, nigga we water-proof 
 I got into it with my car and I said fuck the roof 
 Fuck the roof, fuck the roof, fuck the roof, f-fuck the roof 
 Top back and I'm getting loot 
 Blowing smoke up in the air and saying fuck the roof 
 (Verse 1: 2 Chainz) 
 I'm in my black car chilling with my yellow ho (Yellow ho) 
 It's a two seater but it's known to carry fo'(Okay) 
 2-2 Chainz, Gucci carry-on 
 I got my Gucci shades, now I just carry on 
 And I got four zips off in my Styrofoam 
 See you niggas couldn't reach me on the telephone 
 We the two gun gang nigga, uncaged 
 On the front page known to leave niggas rugs stained 
 And I bought my mistress a sharpay 
 And I bought my yellow bitch a mustang (Get out of here) 
 Long hair, nigga no fade 
 And I just bought a watch that cost a whole thang 
 I'm blowing smoke in here, tell me where's Smokey Bear 
 They say I look like a chimney when I'm on the chair 
 I'm standing in the vip, I'm parked in the vip 
 I go from vip to vip so much that I'm nauseaous 
 Yellow ice caution, I'm cautious, yield 
 My girl like to wear her heels when she on the vodka 
 Real conversate, wine, and a lobster plate 
 I'm 'bout to doctor on this track, it's time to operate 
 Operation, dedication, time to meditate 
 Twenty-eight inches make this bitch levitate 
 I'm on a level where these other niggas feather weights 
 Southside, '09, rolling packs everyday
