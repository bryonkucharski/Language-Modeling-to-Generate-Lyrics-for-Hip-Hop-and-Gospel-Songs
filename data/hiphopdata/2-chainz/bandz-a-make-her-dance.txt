 Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance 
 Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance 
 Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance

 Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance 
 All these chicks popping pussy, I'm just popping bandz 
 Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance 
 These chicks clappin', and they ain't using hands 
 Short hair, like Nia Long, loose ones, she don't need a loan 
 Start twerking when she hear her song, stripper pole her income 
 We get trippy and then some, so nasty when she rollin' 
 She put that ass up in my hands, I remote control it! (Yeah ho) 
 She give me dome when the roof gone, at the K.O.D. she leave with me 
 She got friends, bring three, I got drugs, I got drinks 
 Bend it over, Juicy J gon' poke it like wet paint 
 You say no to ratchet pussy, Juicy J can't 
 Racks errwhere, they showin' racks, I'm throwing racks 
 In the V.I.P, rubber on I'm stretching that 
 Rich niggas tippin', broke niggas lookin' 
 And it ain't a strip club if they ain't showin' pussy 
 Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance 
 All these chicks popping pussy, I'm just popping bandz 
 Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance

 Uh, pop that pussy for a real nigga 
 Pull out my black card, that's my lil' nigga 
 Make a movie with your bitch, Steven Spiel nigga 
 Smoking on Keysh' Col', gimme me chills nigga 
 What's your real name? And not your stripper name 
 I make it rain on ya, like a windowpane 
 Bandz a make her dance, Tunechi make her cum 
 Hit-it-from-the-side-like-a-mother-fucking-bass-drum! 
 Two hoes on one fucking pole, two hoes on my fucking pole 
 I don't tip, I pay bills, bitches call me buffalo 
 Her stomach in and her ass out 
 I'm flyer than the ones they pass out 
 If money grow on trees, I branched out 
 I'm just waiting on my bitch to cash out (Ha ha) 
 Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance 
 All these chicks popping pussy, I'm just popping bandz 
 Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance

 Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance 
 All these chicks popping pussy, I'm just popping bandz 
 Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance 
 These chicks clappin', and they ain't using hands (2 Chainz!) 
 2 Chainz, four bracelets 
 Let me see that ass clap, standing ovation (True!) 
 If yo girl don't swallow kids, man that ho basic 
 Got two bitches wit me, take a shot at one ho, using her friend for a chaser 
 (Bandz a make her bust it) Buss it!

 Young nigga gettin' head while tha engine runnin' (Ergh!) 
 Let me see you wiggle, do it for a real nigga (Yea!) 
 I be laughing to the bank, all you do is giggle 
 Ballin' in my coupe, call it sports car 
 Drop the top and freaky treat that bitch just like a pornstar!
