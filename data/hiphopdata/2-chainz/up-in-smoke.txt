 Okay cool. You got it? Then it's cool 
 Wetness all around me like a pool 
 You say who? 
 I say me, she say we 
 She a selfish little freak: every time she nut she try to go to sleep 
 I go deep, she go "hee!" 
 When she really say "hee!" she say "T!" 
 She don't like to call me Tity, she no me from back in the G 
 I'm a beast, I'm a dog, shit I'm hanging from the tree 
 Yeah, we doing all that monkey shit, that sucking and that fucking shit 
 And if I had another pick, I would pick the other bitch 
 'Cause she more like the way I like em, and this one right here ain't shit 
 This one might need a quilt, it's cold on the other side 
 Her head so fire, I hated for them other guys 
 Pimpin' and I'm mackin' 
 Actin' in the 'lac' and 
 If you out chea working, you ain't worth Curtis Jackson 
 And she cost a hunnid, for some satisfaction 
 And I'm just relaxing 
 (Sample) 
 Yeah. I got a Chevelle with a Corvette engine 
 Champagne, bubble bath, Moet swimming 
 She said, "I don't know what done got into me." 
 And I said, "it was me when you was on liquor" 
 Yeah. Blame it on the alcohol. If you don't remember that, battin' your Nigeria Falls 
 And when I pull em, all I have to do is call: 
 I say come 'ere, and it's a lake in they fucking draws 
 And you late! Faking like a fucking broad 
 Hair hang like a London fall, just becau' 
 And the wind blow, I'm hanging out the window 
 Windtows, pistols, and all common essentials 
 If a nigga talking math, he talking my lingo 
 And if I say I'm popping tags, I'm talking my Benzo 
 I'm fresh off the lot, fresh off the block 
 What?
