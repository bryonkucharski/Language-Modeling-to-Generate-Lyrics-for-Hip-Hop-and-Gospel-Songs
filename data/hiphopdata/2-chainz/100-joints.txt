No matter what they say I smoke 100 joints a day 
 Laying by my chopper, chopper laying by my safe 
 No matter what they say I smoke 100 joints a day 
 Laying by my chopper, chopper laying by my safe 
 No matter what they say I smoke 100 joints a day 
 Hop up out that motherfucker swagging 
 Hop up out that motherfucker dabbing 
 Had an old school on some 'rellis 
 Used to go to school in some Bally's 
 Flexing Macho Man Randy Savage 
 Oh I'm 'bout to let these niggas have it 
 School of hard knocks I graduated 
 I got all my real straight from Baby's 
 Laying by my chopper, chopper laying by my safe 
 No matter what they say 100 joints a day 
 I had 'em pre rolled all yesterday 
 You need your passport for our second date 
 You know I'm fly nigga rocking reptiles 
 I'm whooping on this beat like a step child 
 Big ring and a charm to match 
 Ya my role model was Project Pat 
 Life is too short, nigga born to mac 
 I hop up out that coupe nigga rat, rat 
 Hating on the style I hope you die today 
 I hope they ass don't find your ass for 30 days 
 Mind on my money, money on the state 
 Ain't judge a book by its cover turn the page 
 I like her on the pole that's the business nigga 
 As soon as she get off I'mma kick it with her 
 Laying by my chopper, chopper laying by my safe 
 No matter what they say I smoke 100 joints a day 
 Laying by my chopper, chopper laying by my safe 
 Don't matter what they say I smoke 100 joints a day 
 Time to switch it up for 'em 
 Time to flip it up for 'em 
 Got a Masi on the corner 
 Pull it out when I want to 
 Pull your bitch when I want her 
 Man I want another joint 
 Cold day now Styrofoam, that's getting to the point 
 East Point in this motherfucker 
 College Park in this motherfucker 
 West Side in this motherfucker 
 The best died in this motherfucker 
 My damn street know I'm riding through it 
 Four four two on the hood 
 Do this shit here for the hood 
 Why you niggas shit on the hood? 
 Two two three at the sunroof 
 Niggas spending like one tooth 
 Turn around and see white smoke when I leave out the mic booth 
 I'm tight nigga that's known 
 Put gold on the white coupe 
 Put gold on the white tooth 
 Put gold on my wife too 
 Laying by my chopper, chopper laying by my safe 
 No matter what they say I smoke 100 joints a day 
 Laying by my chopper, chopper laying by my safe 
 No matter what they say I smoke 100 joints a day 
 Laying by my chopper, it's laying by my safe 
 No matter what they say I smoke 100 joints a day 
 Laying by my chopper, it's laying by my safe 
 No matter what they say I smoke 100 joints a day, lil' bitch
