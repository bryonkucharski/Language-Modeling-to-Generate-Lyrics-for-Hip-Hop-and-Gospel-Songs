We the motherfuckin' best nigga (Mike Will Made It) 
 Ace Hood (yeah) 
 It's over, Future (yeah) 
 I come looking for you with Haitians 
 I stay smoking on good Jamaican

 You get money they started hating 
 I woke up in the new Bugatti

 OK, niggas be hatin' I'm rich as a bitch 
 100 K I spent that on my wrist 
 Two hundred thou I spent that on your bitch 
 Do me a model put that on my list 
 Oh there he go in that foreign again 
 Killin' the scene bring the coroner in 
 Murder she wrote, swallow or choke 
 Hit her and go, I won't call her again 
 Woke up early morning, crib as big as a college 
 Smoke me a pound of the loudest 
 Whippin' some shit with no mileage 
 Diamonds cost me a fortune 
 Them horses all in them Porsche's 
 You pussies can't handle, afford it 
 $4,200 my mortgage 
 Ballin' on niggas like Kobe 
 Fuck all you haters you bore me 
 Only the real get a piece of the plate 
 Reppin' my city I'm runnin' my state 
 Keep me a pistol then run with the K's 
 Niggas want beef then I visit ya place, Bang! 
 I come looking for you with Haitians

 Yeah, I'm at it again 
 There go that flow bringin' tragedy in 
 Copped me a chain your salary spent 
 Niggas is sweet, bring them cavities in 
 Countin' money, hourly trend 
 Rolling them skinny like Olsen twins 
 Niggas is squares, cabin Benz 
 Neck full of Gold Olympian shit 
 Neimans, I'm blowin' the check on the gear 
 Fall in some pussy then hop on the leer 
 Strapped with them choppers in back of the rear 
 Sak pase, them killers is here 
 Woke up early morning, mind is tellin' me money 
 Paper, mula, pockets is fat as a tumour 
 Millionaire nigga no rumour 
 Livin' my life off of tuna 
 Want it with me, I deliver the beef 
 Real niggas only enjoyin' the feast 
 Pull up a seat, bon appetite 
 No Louboutin's when that red on your sneaks, Bang 
 I come looking for you with Haitians 
 I stay smoking on good Jamaican 
 I fuck bitches from different races 
 You get money they started hating 
 I woke up in the new Bugatti

 Photographs of dope boys (I see you) 
 Is all they taking, finger prints on the Rolls Royce 
 Is why they hatin' push a button on these broke boys 
 That's detonation, walk a road to riches bare feet 
 I watch mama struggle now she livin' care free 
 That's why I hustle for that half a key that's 12 G's 
 I'm tryin' to bubble every summer a new LP 
 You gotta love me I got shooters out the D-League 
 Signin' bonus hit that man that's from thirty feet 
 Left in a puddle, finger prints is on a hundred mill 
 And what it is? Ricky Rozay and Ace Hood 
 We hella Trill 
 Yeah 
 I come looking for you with Haitians
