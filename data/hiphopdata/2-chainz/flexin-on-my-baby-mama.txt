I said I take care of my kids but I'm flexin' on my baby mama 
 I'm like, "Damn, I shoulda wore a condom!" 
 Boom, boom, boom 
 My shoes sold out in one day 
 Pull out the blueprint, bumpin' dat Gunplay 
 In a Maybach, pockets stay fat 
 So fly, I could parallel park on a fucking runway 
 Going down a one way the wrong way, shoot barrel long range 
 Swag like pro ball, gave her a ring, phone call 
 Money talk, pole vault, walked in, drove off 
 So comfortable at the dealership, I don't take my robe off 
 I wake up and I get to it, breakfast time I might sea food it 
 Lunch time I might lamb chop it 
 And you do is talk shit like you was eatin' booty 
 Southside in my bloodstream, smokin' on that propane 
 I could tell ya ass one thing, I like gettin' head wearing both chains 
 All white with no stains, I been trappin' fore the Grammy nods 
 I been countin' money so long I'mma need a damn hand massage 
 So many cars, I can barely park 
 So many cars, I need another damn garage 
 I'm famous with my fam around, damn I wish I had my dad around 
 Gave a nigga a Lamborghini, so that's a motherfuckin' lamb-me-down 
 Watch how I'mma kill 'em for the summer 
 (Watch how I kill 'em) 
 Watch how I'mma kill 'em for the summer 
 (Watch how I kill 'em) 
 I'm just flexin' on my baby mama 
 (I'm just flexin') 
 I'm just flexin' on my baby mama 
 (I'm just flexin') 
 Watch how I'mma kill 'em for the summer 
 (Watch how I kill 'em) 
 Watch how I'mma kill 'em for the summer 
 (Watch how I kill 'em) 
 I'm just flexin' on my baby mama 
 (I'm just flexin') 
 I'm just flexin' on my baby mama 
 (I'm just flexin') 
 Aye, European style my dresscode, gunshots in the club echo 
 Walk around with a .36 with six shots in my .38 Special 
 Black car, black Timbs, Bank of America back then 
 She tryna tell me her life story and all I want is a lap dance 
 Good times, smokin' J's, rockin' J's, I'm the rap Ernie Barnes 
 If I paint a canvas it'd be melee, firearms 
 Viacom, maricón, if she bad I invite her home 
 Buying chains like I'm buyin' homes 
 Rims taller than Kevin Hart, Ride Along 
 Them rhinestones, you ain't shinin', nigga 
 I ain't hidin' so you ain't gotta find me, nigga 
 All my clothes are designer, nigga 
 And my back seat recliner nigga 
 Came in rockin' all gold and I'm fuckin' all y'all hoes 
 Smokin' on that Lee Haney, sippin' on that hard boiled 
 This that get back - click clack, get back 
 Smokin' on Raw paper, this ain't zig zags 
 Snakeskin wallpaper, rose gold chandelier 
 I'm lookin' for a baby eater, can I get a volunteer? 
 Watch how I'mma kill 'em for the summer 
 (Watch how I kill 'em) 
 Watch how I'mma kill 'em for the summer 
 (Watch how I kill 'em) 
 I'm just flexin' on my baby mama 
 (I'm just flexin') 
 I'm just flexin' on my baby mama 
 (I'm just flexin') 
 I said I take care of my kids but I'm flexin' on my baby mama 
 I'm like "Damn, I shoulda wore a condom!" 
 Boom, boom, boom
