 She in stilettos she walkin' all pigeon toed 
 Really though, when it come to gettin' dough 
 If you listen to me I'm so underground 
 You have to sit on the floor 
 Ow, I just thought I'd seen a spaceship 
 Ride, Right past my airline 
 Everybody know I dumps that 
 White girl like Kevin Federline 
 Don't pay me no nevermind 
 These niggas is buggin', pesticide 
 I count money in my spare time 
 Just paid a hundred dollars for a hairline 
 Label talkin' bout what they woulda did 
 Bet they hustle me and you could be a winner 
 Girl you eat more pussy than me? 
 Girl you shoulda been a nigga 
 Pockets swellin' up like Lymph nodes 
 Been a go-getter from the get go 
 Always talkin' bout what you was finna do 
 Damn broad thought that you were finna get dough

 You a wuda cuda shuda ass hater 
 Wanna be a man so bad homie 
 Ain't wanna see me get free 
 If you could you would have caught the stand on me 
 If I would have shook your hand, I would have been your boy 
 Now you extra hot since I dun hit your broad 
 Now you talkin' now, boss sparkin' now 
 You prolly would shoot somethin' if you had some heart 
 That Bentley come from exotic rentals 
 Gotta go back Sunday, so you flat broke Monday 
 Probably could go spend 200 on somethin' 
 If you was gettin' Boosie money 
 You in King of Diamonds throwin' counterfeit 
 You might as well gon' pussy pop on the stage 
 All these rappers lyin' on records 
 O-M-G Hip-Hop-Hooray! 
 And you probably woulda been up in my video 
 But that was 'fore I went in 
 Ain't even write me no letter 
 You a wuda shuda cuda ass friend, busta!
