Whole lot of money that my BFF 
 Keep a Glock .40 in my Fendi belt 
 Getting so much cash I don't need a wallet 
 You smoking on that trash, throw it in the garbage 
 Young street nigga coming from the pot 
 Hanging on the block, kickin' with the convict 
 They say that money talk so don't you make a comment 
 I'm proud of myself motherfucker I done it 
 Done it, done it, done it man I'm runnin' up 
 Tity Boi 'bout to fuck the summer up 
 Order some new thing for the Wraith 
 3rd chain on to get her naked 
 I'ma poster child for the hustle 
 You a poser child for them bustas 
 Game up for grabs, I'ma take it 
 Try to stay down like the pavement 
 Live by the code, keep it true 
 Anything and everything to get a loot 
 Nigga think they trill but I'm triller 
 Nigga think they ill but I'm iller 
 Nigga think they big but I'm larger 
 Pussy you ain't nothin' but a target 
 Smokin' on joints, gettin' massages 
 Keep dodgin' me and I charge up 
 Whole lot of money that my BFF 
 Keep a Glock .40 in my Fendi belt 
 Getting so much cash I don't need a wallet 
 You smoking on that trash, throw it in the garbage 
 Young street nigga coming from the pot 
 Hanging on the block, kickin' with the convict 
 They say that money talk so don't you make a comment 
 I'm proud of myself motherfucker I done it 
 In first class they ask me what I do 
 Had a stove, microwave and a blender too 
 Pull up on your set in a 62 
 Pull up on your set just to send 'em through 
 Shittin' on them niggas like an enema 
 Fuck the bitch, had to say I'm into her 
 Nigga know I know I been winnin' 
 Niggas I know I know I don't give any fucks 
 Sold my Monte Carlo, bought a Cadillac 
 Sold my Cadillac and went and got a Beamer 
 I used to put my drawls in the cleaners 
 Trap down the street from Phillips Arena 
 Spend a lil money you can't take it with ya 
 They said the feds out here takin' pictures 
 Well I'm the freshest nigga on their Instagram 
 Hashtag making bands, yes I am 
 Whole lot of money that my BFF 
 Keep a Glock .40 in my Fendi belt 
 Getting so much cash I don't need a wallet 
 You smoking on that trash, throw it in the garbage 
 Young street nigga coming from the pot 
 Hanging on the block, kickin' with the convict 
 They say that money talk so don't you make a comment
