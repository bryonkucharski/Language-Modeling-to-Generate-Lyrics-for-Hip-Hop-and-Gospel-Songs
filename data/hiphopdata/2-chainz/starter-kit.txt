Kush packs and them rubber bands were my starter kit 
 Gun shots at your mama house cause you started it 
 Niggas taking every damn thing, if they ordered it 
 You front the packs and we don't call you back, then it's over with 
 Mama saying boy why y'all playing in that water 
 Got granny saying what y'all doing with my foes 
 Bigger sister saying y'all lil boy look suspicious 
 Got mama saying what y'all doing with my dishes 
 Twelve came through and we had for the fishes 
 Got locked up in school, we ain't worried 'bout detention 
 Heard mama walking through the 'partments with a (?) 
 Whoadie mama said I know y'all boys ain't been to school 
 Hit the D-mall like a motherfucking school 
 Yeah we shoot but we in the pool shooting pool 
 J's rushed the card I have to call a fucking check bout 
 If swag was a plane I'm finna motherfucking take off 
 Watch me shake the fake off, watch me shake the fake off 
 I am on so much green I can play golf 
 Kush pack and the rubber band and a digi scale 
 And a zip lock, residue all in my fingernails 
 Kush packs and them rubber bands were my starter kit 
 Gun shots at your mama house cause you started it 
 Niggas taking every damn thing, if they ordered it 
 You front the packs and we don't call you back, then it's over with 
 Selling bags, zip locks, six Glocks, twenty scales 
 Sick spot, fuck my car you should see what my bitch got 
 If you ain't get no money my nigga then you can't hang at this spot 
 Nigga wanna play then okay somebody get shot 
 Rollies for the whole team, urine full of codeine 
 Pounds on the Sunbeam, baby ballers with more lean 
 I'm young and dumb and I ain't got no patience 
 I'm 'bout to pull up at the trap and see what's shaking 
 I bought me fifty he front me fifty, I thought 'bout taking it 
 My nigga told me don't do it so I went paid the man 
 I let your bitch come to me and then told her get away from here 
 Strong packs and calculators, ain't nothing but a pint in that refrigerator 
 Kush packs and them rubber bands were my starter kit 
 Gun shots at your mama house cause you started it 
 Niggas taking every damn thing, if they ordered it 
 You front the packs and we don't call you back, then it's over with
