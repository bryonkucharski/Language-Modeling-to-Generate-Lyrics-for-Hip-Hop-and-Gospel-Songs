I smoked a blunt for dinner, another blunt for breakfast 
 2 Chainz, got 'em staring at my necklace 
 Let's make a sex tape and put it on Netflix 
 Let's make a sex tape and put it on Netflix 
 She got it, I want it, I want it, she got it 
 I'm dodging paparazzi, my outfit from Versace 
 Copy, copy, all these niggas just copy 
 I just bought me a new watch and these new niggas just watchin' 
 I know you had the time of your life 
 I know you had the time of your life 
 You know I'm gettin' money, ten, twenty, thirty, forty 
 I'll be countin' this shit all night 
 I know you had the time of your life 
 I know you had the time of your life 
 You know I'm gettin' money, ten, twenty, thirty, forty 
 I'll be countin' this shit all night 
 When I die, bury me inside the liquor store 
 'Cause when I die, Fergie still gon' be gettin' dough 
 You do what you can, I do what you can't 
 You smoke that Bobby Brown, we on that Shabba Ranks 
 I got it, you want it, you want it, I got it 
 My girls go shopping, that ain't a mall, that's my closet 
 So copy, copy, all these bitches just copy 
 Honor student wit' double Ds, that ain't the bra, that's my ta-tas 
 I know you had the time of your life 
 I know you had the time of your life 
 You know I'm gettin' money, ten, twenty, thirty, forty 
 I'll be countin' this shit all night 
 I know you had the time of your life 
 I know you had the time of your life 
 You know I'm gettin' money, ten, twenty, thirty, forty 
 I'll be countin' this shit all night 
 I'm gettin' to the monies with an apostrophe 
 Fucked her on a pile of clothes now she a closet freak 
 Yeah I bear arms, I got something up my sleeve 
 And when she wit' me, she don't wanna leave 
 She just wanna freak, she don't wanna sleep 
 Put it in her mouth now she don't wanna speak 
 Yeah I'm at the club, I got strippers at my table 
 I call doin' the 69 a favor for a favor 
 From the cradle to the grave, shoot a nigga from his ankle to his waist 
 You can tell that I'm paid 'cause I'm high-class 
 Fucked a bitch in her eyelashes, we in a jet, who gon' fly past us? 
 Tint all on my eyeglasses, I don't see ya hater 
 And bitch I don't get dropped, bitch I drop the label 
 Goddamn!
