Poor fool, streets don't love you like I do 
 (My mama always said) 
 I said close your mouth and eat 
 You make some paper, then you make your own rules 
 (My mama always said, ay, damn) 
 Poor fool, streets don't love you like I do 
 I said close your mouth and eat 
 You make some paper, then you make your own rules 
 I'm from the hood and it's evident 
 Used to sell drugs out my residence 
 Stayed in section 8 with relatives 
 Opportunity knockin', I let 'em in 
 I done put Forgis on everything 
 I left the mall like Ginobili 
 And if I'm not successful, ain't nobody gon' come console me 
 I pray my mama quit smokin' 
 When my dad died, I got focused 
 I gotta table full of Ace of Spades 
 I don't fuck around with you jokers (ooh) 
 Ain't heard a word from my old friends 
 Heard they wanna kick my doors in 
 I done loaded up the 2-2-3 
 I'm so high they might call a goaltend, yeah 
 Lord knows, stashed work in the console 
 So many autos in my garage, I can't open my car door 
 Bond on me like the sun on me 
 Gettin' this bread she say, "You dropped crumbs on me" 
 Walked in the club and got ones only 
 Need a tat on my stomach that say prawns only 
 Raised by single parent Black woman 
 They call me Tity Boi 'cause she used to spoil me 
 She always told me 
 Poor fool, streets don't love you like I do 
 (My mama always said) 
 I said close your mouth and eat 
 You make some paper, then you make your own rules

 Poor fool, streets don't love you like I do 
 I said close your mouth and eat 
 You make some paper, then you make your own rules 
 Smoking on a yacht, call me Ricky Steamboat 
 Bags full of gas, used to serve them through the screen door 
 Tryna flip a brick, Shaq at the free throw 
 Taught by Scarface, Brad Jordan, Al Pacino, woo 
 No rules, most of my partnas homeschooled 
 Most of my partnas got charges 
 And I ain't talking about no mothafuckin' dodges 
 Trappin' up outta the college 
 I'm addicted to the rice at Benihana 
 Raised by a single parent Black woman 
 They call me Tity Boi 'cause she used to spoil me 
 She always told me 
 Poor fool, streets don't love you like I do 
 (Yeah) 
 I said close your mouth and eat 
 You make some paper, then you make your own rules
