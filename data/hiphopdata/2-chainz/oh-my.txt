 Like LeBron, I'm taking my talents down the south beach 
 Pineapple to chase it, go 'head girl just taste it 
 All we drink is my shit, coco loso wasted 
 Love that little waist shit, damn them hips just sit out 
 Now I see who all these hating girls be talkin' shit bout 
 From the front looking like she got some ass probably 
 They say that's a sign girl ass-trology 
 Tight denim with them little rips in 'em 
 Wait in line jeans, take a minute to get in 'em 
 BBD say you poison well I want some of that venom girl, girl

 Oh, girl your ass is superthick 
 Lotta chicks off in this club and you the baddest in this bitch 
 Oh, look at what you wearing girl 
 The club owner should pay you whenever you make an appearance 
 And you got me hooked, I might try not to look 
 But I keep staring 
 Come out to my city see, I run that bitch like errands oh 
 Grown as hell I don't care to choose 
 Who's coming, you, her and you 
 Roll this up, after you hit it once, you'll need a parachute 
 To tell the truth I'm a tear the roof 
 Out that motherfucker nail it too 
 Loud pipes, hear the coupe, vroom, got stripes like a general 
 You know I'm tryna get into you

 Now you the baddest that I've seen in the club all night 
 Girl, your booty had me stuck like a drug all night 
 Damn, girl I really wanna put it on you like a coaster 
 Love how you moving over there but I really want you closer 
 Let get drunk off this Moscato, do it like there's no tomorrow 
 Wake up and if it's up we'll do it like there's no tomorrow 
 Jump on it, I want it, he on it, bone it 
 Whenever she want it 
 R-O-S-C-O-E, we dismantling every component 
 Girl you the one, too bad I'm not a jumper? 
 She love the way the rapper tastes, too bad I'm not a sucker 
 She call me when she need it 
 And I'm a come running to feed that appetite I do it anyway she want it
