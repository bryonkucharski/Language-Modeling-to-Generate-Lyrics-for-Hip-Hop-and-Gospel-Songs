Hey, big bank, lotta guap, (yeah) 
 They 'bout a dolla? I ain't tryin' to holla 
 '96 Impala buckets under that 
 On automatic status, we ain't havin' none of that 
 Hey watch it partna, stay out my lane 
 Everybody fuckin' with my campaign 
 Get dough or get lost, shawty always 
 Like Dro say, ho fuck with me the long way 
 And I deliver long john son, I don't play 
 Poppin' out before the sun come, I don't stay 
 They say bullshit walk, and cash talk 
 That's why I'm ridin' out, pockets on loud mouth (Yeah) 
 I'm goin' in, finna spazz out 
 Aigga got a problem, we can air it out 
 They say bullshit walk, and cash talk 
 That's why I'm ridin' out, pockets on loud mouth 
 Woke up this morning with a bank roll 
 I be gettin' head like a Kango 
 Got your girl sellin' pussy to my tango 
 What, she so wet, think I'm gonna need a rain coat 
 On 285 doing 85! 
 Couple hoes in my stable, time to stabilize 
 Check the time, I better say mine bitches 
 Need a sign on my dick that say "Fine Bitches" 
 And you know I'm throwed like five pitchers 
 And you know I'm high like five Swishas 
 Jay's used to say "what up Slim? " 
 'Cause they know I'm known to make that work cartwheel 
 Hot wheel, hot steel, ride around my block still 
 Even if it's winter time, I'm ridin' in a drop still 
 You don't have an idea of the life that I live 
 Pockets so loud, got them bitches doin' adlibs 
 I'm goin' in, finna spazz out 
 Nigga got a problem, we can air it out 
 They say bullshit walk, and cash talk 
 So I'm ridin' out, pockets on loud mouth 
 Back on my 1-2 nigga, ace - deuce 
 Feds try to crucify me, call me Jesús 
 Get it straight dude, I ain't with that nonsense 
 Bank rolls like a bad bitch lookin' all mint 
 No joystickin' nothin' over here dog 
 So ain't no playin' me at all, let's be clear dog 
 I'm raw as ever, flaw is never [?] 
 Just as blind [?] tough as leather [?] eatin' better 
 Somebody better tell 'em 
 'Fore that tré four seven hit they cerebellum 
 Hey they say bullshit walk and cash talk 
 That's why I'm ridin' I'm goin' in, finna spazz out 
 Nigga got a problem, we can air it out 
 They say bullshit walk, and cash talk 
 So I'm ridin' out, pockets on loud mouth
