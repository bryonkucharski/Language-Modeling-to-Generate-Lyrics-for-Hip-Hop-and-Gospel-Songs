Honey, we got off on the wrong foot, baby 
 Cause the relationship has been so good lately 
 If I don't do what I do, then who's gon put food on the table? 
 It is what it is, I'm just handling biz 
 But I do what I do so we can live 
 I only do what I do so we can live 
 I only do what I do so we can live 
 I only do what I do so we can live 
 I only do what I do so we can live 
 Mama don't work, heater don't work 
 Police pulled me over and said he seen weed on my shirt 
 I pray to the lord and ask for forgiveness 
 If he popped my trunk I can get a life sentence 
 He came a little closer and told me that he smellin' it 
 I said "I rolled one up, I won't insult your intelligence 
 But I threw it out the window half a mile ago" 
 He asked me when the last time I smoke, I said a while ago 
 Forgive me officer, I'm stressin' and my pockets sore 
 Hurtin', chillin' with my dog like a fuckin' Labrador 
 He said he ain't with the bull: matador 
 Looked at the top of my car, like what this lighter for? 
 I told him I was puttin' girls up in the mornin' 
 And I'm goin' to my uncle's house to see if he can join me 
 The officer got a call so he was needed 
 And he told me slow it down, and I told him please believe it 
 Then I proceeded to go to my uncle's house 
 Well it really wasn't my uncle, it was a junkie's house 
 He got a badass niece with a donkey now 
 Pullin' out the parking lot, headed to the other spot 
 Out all night, addict with addicts, causin' Havoc, I'm a Prodigy 
 Niggas know we Mobbin' Deep, gotta stay up when everyone fall asleep 
 The good die young, and promises are hard to keep 
 I left my old job, and now them niggas hardly speak 
 I got a new job, and plus I'm making more a week 
 The girl that I'm with is like a young Kimora Lee 
 I got them folks fiendin', pumpin' that Jodeci 
 Sippin' and my soda pink, you niggas is toilet seat 
 Check my resume, it used to say I sold quarter keys 
 Conduct disorderly, stayin' in the trap house 
 Trips went to work, I'm so glad that it mapped out 
 Honey, we got off on the wrong foot, baby 
 Cause the relationship has been so good lately 
 If I don't do what I do, then who's gon put food on the table? 
 It is what it is, I'm just handling biz 
 But I do what I do so we can live 
 I only do what I do so we can live 
 I only do what I do so we can live 
 I only do what I do so we can live 
 I only do what I do so we can live 
 Simon says, monkey see monkey do 
 I wore the shirt, you wore the same shirt too 
 See me with my bitch, you buy your bitch the same purse 
 Shoot you and your nigga, y'all can share the same hearse 
 This that murder 1, mixed with the bubblegum 
 Kept working my dun dun duns, come get your mama some 
 Nigga, this that slum talk, some say we talks slums 
 I rarely finish the end of my words 
 Watch the rims hit on the curve 
 And what a nigga really care about a lisp? 
 People arguin' over me while I'm layin' in a bitch 
 Death to a snitch, get it while you can (break) and shit 
 Its 3:30 in the A.M. 
 We're just gettin' started like when I had the van 
 Bought the tour bus and put some niggas in the pass 
 Your style good enough to put in a glass bag 
 You know I'm getting' mine, you should use a hashtag 
 Flow off the hinges tryna fuck all her friendses 
 Just killed her pussy, you gon' have to use forensics 
 Organized crime, you can put me in a lineup 
 Plus I got dreads, I'll pay a hundred for the line up 
 Appetite for destruction, and I don't a menu 
 So far ahead of y'all niggas, I can see you in my rearview 
 See you in my rearview one of your headlights out nigga 
 I just got my first R&B bitch and got head all night with her 
 She said she tired of the generic 
 I say what up, she say what up, what up, you a parrot? 
 I'm like "Bird ass girl, aren't you sick of the rhetoric?" 
 And if I ain't arrogant, I'm out of my element
