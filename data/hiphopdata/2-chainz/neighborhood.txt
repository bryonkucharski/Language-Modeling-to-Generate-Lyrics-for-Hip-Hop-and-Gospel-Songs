I been on the road so long, I forgot what kind of cars I got 
 I rap so much I forgot what kind of bars I got 
 Rose in the concrete, rose to the top 
 Son of a gun, raised by a Glock 
 Georgia Power was off I was raised in the dark I don't know if it faze me or not 
 No telling 
 If I didn't turn 15 I wouldn't have been a felon (I bought it) 
 I bought the violence in my stick shift 
 If you don't shoot or get shot at you ain't go through adolescents 
 If you ain't go through all the pressure, You ain't get all of your blessings 
 What you know about not being able to re up going through depression 
 What you do about aggression, What you do about confession 
 If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing 
 If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing 
 If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing 
 If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing 
 Crunching numbers with (?) heads 
 7 figures in Buckhead 
 I get dope too that's enough bread 
 Money tall so it's enough said 
 It was toom poom, Baby amp and big you stand for upset 
 I can tell you where the plug at he over there where my 'cause at 
 Say I'm under the influence I was down stairs where the drugs at 
 40 cal, 50 cal, even my momma tote a pistol now 
 They call on that Crenshaw only thing we need is a mister child 
 You already know what this about, I shouldn't be riding around with this amount 
 'Cause I can take your bitch with this amount 
 And take her on a trip with this amount 
 I look like a lick, act like I'm rich 
 Talk like a whip, walk like a brick 
 Fly like a blimp, right over the public 
 If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing 
 If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing 
 If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing 
 If it wasn't for my neighborhood then I wouldn't be nothing 
 Crunching numbers with (?) heads 
 7 figures in Buckhead
