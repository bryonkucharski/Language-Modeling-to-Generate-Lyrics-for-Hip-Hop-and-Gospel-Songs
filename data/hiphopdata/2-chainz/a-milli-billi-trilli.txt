It's that moon rock shit 
 You gotta mix this with some regular OG 
 'Cause this shit be burnin' crazy 
 Cum in a bitch and I go crazy 
 Spend all these racks and I go crazy 
 Leave out the parking lot doin' a 180

 Drop the top and start sun bathing 
 Put her on a treadmill and then I make her run naked 
 Got all my side hoes frustrated 
 This the life I waited on 
 Seen a bitch from school, 
 Gave her number to a payphone 
 I don't know what you been waiting on 
 All that I know is that I been waiting long 
 I ain't waiting to get no lone 
 Provolone on top of Provolone 
 Mobile phone on top of mobile phone 
 I don't know what you niggas smokin' on 
 Pull my closet got a OS tell 
 Mobile home on top of mobile home 
 I go to sleep with a rollie on 
 I start my car with remote control 
 Get so much pussy

 Fuck it, I want me a milli

 My niggas go bap bap bap bap till it's empty 
 Fuck 2 every night in 5 days that's a 10 piece 
 My bitch that I'm with that's a 10 piece

 I'm smokin' weed. fuck the penalty 
 Ridin' round in a old school, with 2 hoes and a little old me 
 Fuck I'ma do wit this money 
 But walk in a club and start stuntin' 
 Push all my old bitches buttons 
 Came up from nothin' to something 
 Tell her take the stick, don't run from me 
 There's some for you, there's some for me 
 So if we have this 3 some, just make sure you cum for me 
 All that bullshit is up under me 
 Smokin' gas ain't no tumble weed 
 All of this cash that's another thing 
 Black and yellow like a bumblebee

 Had the chickens missing winters 
 In Miami, Mr. Winner 
 Ran a 14 for breakfast, prime 1-twelve for dinner 
 Maison Margiela killer 
 Got a heart of a killer
