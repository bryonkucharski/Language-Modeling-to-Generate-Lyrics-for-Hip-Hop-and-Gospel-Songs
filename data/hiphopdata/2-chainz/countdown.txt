 Lights out, take your shirt off 
 My phone ringing for some work, bird call 
 Then I take your girl, and swerve off 
 Drop it in, load off 
 Facial expression, it started off with a text and 
 The texting ended up special 
 And now you next to a blessing 
 It's me, especially when I'm looking in your direction 
 If love is a drug then I'm arrested for your possestion

 24/7,365 on them inner thighs 
 I memorize what I did when I'm inside 
 That in and out, that up and down 
 That side to side 
 I spray paint them walls, I vandalize 
 Crab legs by candle light 
 I break'em open, like I break you open 
 Break you off, countdown, I'm taking off 
 You a hard worker baby, knew you shouldn't date a boss 
 5-4-3-2-1, I'm taking off

 And baby when I get it, I'm a get in it
