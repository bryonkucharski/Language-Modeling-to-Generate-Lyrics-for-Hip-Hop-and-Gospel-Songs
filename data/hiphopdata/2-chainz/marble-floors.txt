So I let the bitch hang out with me right 
 You know word got around I was fucking this nigga bitch 
 So the nigga called me, he like "you fuckin' my bitch"- 
 I'm like I'm fuckin' her right now 
 Got ya bitch tip-toein' on my marble floors 
 Red bottoms only for the centerfolds 
 Big bodies I got 10 of those 
 Whippin' work it smelling like they dinner rolls 
 Told that bitch take your shoes off, look don't even argue 
 Got your bitch tip-toeing on Italian marble 
 They on that bad batch, too much pork around it 
 Shorty ass fat you gotta walk around it 
 Big body got ten of those 
 Cars, cribs that's eight hoes 
 Nine piece that's dinner rolls 
 Wild freaks, that centrefold 
 Hundred on my shine 
 You don't like it fine 
 Got ya bitch tip-toeing like Gregory Hines 
 Cashing out with that nina 
 Ten days you ain't seen her 
 She ask for it, I beat her 
 You greedy nigga you eat it 
 These ? niggas all on my dick 
 Princess cuts all in my wrist 
 Hundred rounds all in my hip 
 200 grand all in my whip 
 Got ya bitch tip-toein' on my marble floors 
 Red bottoms only for the centerfolds 
 Big bodies I got 10 of those 
 Whippin' work it smelling like they dinner rolls 
 Wet work, got the kitchen stanking 
 We call a undercover, a pig in the blanket 
 Uh, lifestyles of the rich and famous 
 Shoot you in ya head like Abraham Lincoln 
 Stuntin' on them bitches like Birdman 
 Roll the weed in white sheets, Ku Klux Klan 
 Put it on the scale, watch it do numbers 
 Playing with them keys like Stevie Wonder 
 All my hoes pretty, all my niggas brazy 
 We sell that white, sell that brown, call it rice and gravy 
 Call me Tunechi Lee or don't call me at all 
 Man fuck all you niggas, pause 
 Got ya bitch tip-toein' on my marble floors 
 Red bottoms only for the centerfolds 
 Big bodies I got 10 of those 
 Whippin' work it smelling like they dinner rolls 
 2 Chainz, that's your best answer 
 Cup filled with pink, I'm supporting breast cancer 
 I might do that walk for the 5k 
 I get paid every time I leave my driveway 
 Got yo girl tip-toeing on my marble floors 
 Sitting by the pool, jumping off the diving board 
 Getting to the money I'mma need a money counter 
 So many acres, my neighbours stay in another county 
 Ted Dibiase in Versace loafers 
 All you talk is shit nigga halitosis 
 Ghosts, I pulled up in that pale thang 
 Got a Chanel chain, on top of Chanel chain, on top of Chanel chain, on top of Chanel chain 
 Goddamn! 
 Got ya bitch tip-toein' on my marble floors 
 Red bottoms only for the centerfolds 
 Big bodies I got 10 of those 
 Whippin' work it smelling like they dinner rolls
