You gotta known how to have fun when you get these checks man 
 Nah, I'mma put this on your camera. You need... I'm bout to tell you right now 
 Tell me what I need. Tity Boi. Tity Boi 
 You need to tell Cris go on let you go 
 Young Mula it out, we have fun over here, we just eating 
 We having fun, we just doing stuff, we don't even care about 
 (Go get my shit). Young Money, we care 
 If it wasn't for Wayne, it wouldn't be 
 A lot of dudes in the game, including me 
 We was smoking that gas in '03 
 Was gon' sell a few bags to Lil Fee 
 Couple years removed from HBs 
 Tatted lyrics from Jigga to Jay-Z 
 I went to Eastover before Katrina 
 Remember going to Magic riding in my B-mer 
 And this was way before FEMA, and you was rappin' and singin' 
 And I was slanging the Ps and smoking nigga like Newport 
 Comin' up off of Too Short, my underwear was my hoop shorts 
 And then I went on tour and recorded a song on your tour bus 
 And that was '08, that's the first time I met Drake 
 When I hit your cup with that drank, had a nigga stomach like wait 
 That my dog, that my dog, that my dog, yeah, that my dog 
 That my dog uh, that my dog, that my dog, that my dog 
 That my dog, that my dog, that my dog, that my dio, yeah that my dog 
 You relocated to MIA 
 You told me shawdy this where I stay 
 I came down to pay a visit 
 You told me Zoe Pound and them was trippin' 
 And you, you wasn't dippin' 
 Had the M-16 and with the extra clip, ready to act ignorant 
 Ridin' off in the Phantom, and Mr. G he was driving 
 Pumpin' that Playaz Circle, you told me that we was riding 
 And I told you that I was rappin', I told you I wasn't writing 
 You said Luda was foolish because he wasn't excited 
 That was way before Tyga, I saw Nicki with Gucci 
 You said, "You can make a million rappin' 'bout some pussy, I did." 
 T, Fewq, Mally Mal, shining like Armor Oil 
 You can ask Mac, I was YM 'fore all of y'all 
 Stunna said I reminded him of Johnny 
 In this world you either selling or you buying 
 That my dog, that my dog, that my dog, yeah, that my dog 
 That my dog uh, that my dog, that my dog, that my dog 
 That my dog, that my dog, that my dog, that my dog, yeah that my dog 
 You tatted your face and changed the culture 
 You screamed soowoo and them gangstas loved it 
 You bought a Bugatti so you can flex 
 And most of the bad bitches your ex 
 Ride till the wheels fall off and they got wobbly 
 Duffle Bag video, we shot that bitch on Godby 
 You was holding a sty-ry, I had more gold than a pirate 
 They said it ain't about stylin', what they tryin' to kick knowledge 
 Duffle Bag Boys, yeah I can't forget Dolla 
 In going to get the money, it's some words that I follow 
 I swallow my pride, smoking endo outside 
 Straight from Collegrove, I'm reporting live 
 That my dog, that my dog, that my dog, yeah, that my dog 
 That my dog uh, that my dog, that my dog, that my dog 
 That my dog, that my dog, that my dog, that my dog, yeah that my dog
