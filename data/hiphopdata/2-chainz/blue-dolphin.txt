My mind for the intellectual 
 Had sex with her on my sectional 
 Slowed it down, take it extra slow 
 Bust on myself like plexi co 
 Oh all right here I go 
 Shorty got my love in the finger fold 
 I got a manicure, pedicure 
 I got her hair done and credit card new 
 I'm balling on her big time 
 Told shorty I'm 6'5" 
 Stand up on my bankroll, make me look like I'm 6'9" 
 She look like she been fine 
 She always call me big time 
 Pinky ring on, you should see the way I sip wine 
 I'm maestro in the main suite 
 Make a side chick out your main squeeze 
 Better hop on board 'fore the train leave 
 Shorty outta place 'cause I slang D 
 And I'm changes need my chain freeze 
 Meant to say my chain froze 
 Everytime I change clothes 
 Cherish the game 
 When we fly far away 
 Sky dive in a puddle of mud 
 Make it rain blue dolphin 
 All I see is blue dolphin 
 I like when she smile 
 She like when I make her smile 
 She like when I put it down 
 She like when I come in town 
 I like when she on the brown 
 She like when I'm on the loud 
 Seen her take some coke then smile 
 Seen her take a perc then pow 
 Birkin bag see no salt 
 All on the beach with toes out 
 All on the beach sea gulls out 
 All in the jeep windows down 
 Where I come from the Regals out 
 She knows I turn up on the molly 
 She doing string thing for money 
 I'm trying to put it in her tummy 
 I might whisper in her earlobe 
 I'm blowing kisses in her earlobe 
 I'm telling things she ain't built for 
 Money long as Lincoln Continentals 
 Codeine with a touch of Sprite 
 Geeked up for a hundred nights 
 I'm a roll had a Cuban link 
 In a figaro this a finger roll 
 Cherish the game 
 When we fly far away 
 Sky dive in a puddle of mud 
 Make it rain blue dolphin 
 All I see is blue dolphin 
 Cherish the game 
 When we fly far away 
 Sky dive in a puddle of mud 
 Make it rain blue dolphin 
 All I see is blue dolphin
