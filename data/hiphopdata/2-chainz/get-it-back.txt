Get it back, get it back 
 Bitch, I know I get it back 
 Give a fuck bout that little paper 
 'Cause I know I get it back 
 I got cash, cash on fire 
 Cash on hand, cash on deck 
 Give me everything 3 X 
 And all 12's up off that rack 
 Wash my stash with Ajax 
 Me and Tit, back to back 
 And we ridin' around, smoking Kush by the pound 
 Like how it ride but we love how it sound 
 Drop-top Lam so low to the ground 
 Just like a snail, I'm close to the earth 
 Waves on my temp, so a ho gotta surf 
 Hollering rock when you're scared, go to church 
 Me and Slim Dunk in the club throwing racks 
 Go into the trap and I get it right back 
 Want 10 bricks? You can get it right now 
 Pull to the trap house, come to the back 
 Riding domestic with the trunk in the back 
 Riding in a foreign, so the trunk in the front 
 Sixty thousand cash just for me to roll blunts 
 Standing in front, blowing kush through her dress 
 Five grand just to see her dance 
 Ten grand just to see her tats 
 Jump in the corner and he smoking on her clit 
 Waiting on you, so he get it right back 
 Get it back, get it back 
 Bitch, I know I get it back 
 Give a fuck bout that little paper 
 'Cause I know I get it back 
 In the club, throwin' money 
 I done run through me some racks 
 Give a fuck bout that little paper 
 I know I get it back 
 Get it back, get it back 
 Bitch, I know I get it back 
 Give a fuck bout that little paper 
 'Cause I know I get it back 
 Get it back, get it back 
 Yeah, you know I get it back 
 Shorty say she want my name 
 So I bought that bitch a tat 
 I walk in this bitch with racks 
 Tell them, come and get this paper 
 Yeah, my bitch is made in Asia 
 And I'm icy like a glacier 
 Get your baby momma 
 Take her then make her 
 You date her, then fuck her 
 I fuck her, then date her 
 Everything is on the up 
 Like a elevator 
 Gucci Mane and Tity Boi 
 College Park and Decatur 
 Now I do it for the haters 
 Started with a Buick LeSabre 
 Ended with that Ferrari 
 Tell me, meet me up out in Vegas 
 Got so many acres 
 I don't ever see my neighbors 
 Niggas say they want a mil 
 I put money on the table 
 Get it back, get it back 
 Bitch, I know I get it back 
 Give a fuck bout that little paper 
 'Cause I know I get it back 
 In the club, throwin' money 
 I done run through me some racks 
 Give a fuck bout that little paper 
 I know I get it back 
 Get it back, get it back 
 Bitch, I know I get it back 
 Give a fuck bout that little paper 
 'Cause I know I get it back
