I'm like a quarterback, hand it off 
 Drop the work in the pot, watch it cannonball 
 I done seen 'em ball, I done seen 'em fall 
 Rest in peace to my nigga, you da realest, dawg 
 You da realest, dawg, you da realest, dawg 
 You da realest, dawg, you da realest, dawg 
 You da realest, dawg, you da realest, dawg 
 You da realest, dawg, you da realest, dawg 
 I'm like a quarterback, hand it off 
 Drop the work in the pot, watch it cannonball 
 I done seen 'em ball, I done seen 'em fall 
 Rest in peace to my nigga, you da realest, dawg 
 You da realest, dawg, you da realest, dawg 
 You da realest, dawg, you da realest, dawg 
 You da realest, dawg, you da realest, dawg 
 You da realest, dawg, you da realest, dawg 
 You the realest, ain't no gimmicks, I got illness 
 If this rap game is my building, I got tenants, I got tenants 
 I got "gettin' it" in my spirit 
 I'm winning to the end, and I just made me some millions 
 And this only the beginning 
 Rest in peace to all my niggas, they died while they was servin' 
 Rest in peace to all the soldiers that died in the service 
 I died in her cervix 
 Chicken's, no churches 
 Never seen a man cry 'til you seen a man die: closed curtain 
 Closed casket, blasted, breathe again, Braxton 
 Heart filled with passion, neck filled with mansions 
 Nonchalant and sarcastic, my bank roll gigantic 
 School of hard knocks 
 I am the man on this campus 
 I'm like a quarterback, hand it off 
 Drop the work in the pot, watch it cannonball 
 I done seen 'em ball, I done seen 'em fall 
 Rest in peace to my nigga, you da realest, dawg 
 You da realest, dawg, you da realest, dawg 
 You da realest, dawg, you da realest, dawg 
 You da realest, dawg, you da realest, dawg 
 You da realest, dawg, you da realest, dawg 
 I can't explain it, how I'm getting to the payments 
 Rest in peace to my nigga, God bless all his babies 
 And he gettin' so much money, I know this shit sound crazy 
 But he coulda retired and he was born in the 80's 
 And my hair look I'm from Haiti 
 Haters say I act funny 
 I'm on my baby, I'm about my cash money 
 I'm tryna get meals like I'm past hungry 
 Got two or three "Rest In Peace" tats on me 
 What's really real? Just left the dealership 
 Pull your girl off my car, that's that whip appeal 
 I'm 'bout to milk the game if a mil 
 Hit the girl with my two's, Benedryl 
 I'm like a quarterback, hand it off 
 Drop the work in the pot, watch it cannonball 
 I done seen 'em ball, I done seen 'em fall 
 Rest in peace to my nigga, you da realest, dawg 
 You da realest, dawg, you da realest, dawg 
 You da realest, dawg, you da realest, dawg 
 You da realest, dawg, you da realest, dawg 
 You da realest, dawg, you da realest, dawg
