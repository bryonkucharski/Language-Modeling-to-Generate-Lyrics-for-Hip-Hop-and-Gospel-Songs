So many watches, I need a time capsule 
 Combine all my thoughts, make my mind travel 
 Graduated from the streets, that's beyond tassel 
 In my muscle car, maybe we should arm wrestle 
 I'm raw, using all caps 
 I got A on my ballcaps 
 No, I didn't do it but I thought about it 
 If I would have did it, it would have chalk around 
 Yellow tape, never hesitate 
 2 Chainz derived from Section 8 
 Meditate, that's my stress relief 
 I've been stylin' on 'em, since a lease, preach 
 Live long enough, it'll happen to you 
 Live long 
 It will, it will 
 It will, it will 
 Live long enough, it'll happen to you 
 Live long 
 It will, it will 
 It will, it will 
 My pop' told me men don't cry 
 Then he turned around and died on me 
 So I didn't know what else to do 
 But motherfuckin' cry, homie 
 Oh yeah, I'm God's son 
 Tell Nas he got more than one 
 And me, I got more to see, more to be 
 Order three, started with a quarter ki' 
 I'm so ill I need penicill' 
 Rockin' ice cubes, talkin' kill at will 
 And these days you can't tell who is really real 
 Ridin' on some Emmitt Smith's, long way from Emmett Till 
 Live long enough, it'll happen to you 
 Live long 
 It will, it will 
 It will, it will 
 Live long enough, it'll happen to you 
 Live long 
 It will, it will 
 It will, it will 
 Streets love a nigga, got a D-boy membership 
 We do it from the heart, I hope the aunt will remember this 
 Coke on all sinisters, cold but no fridge in this 
 No to all witnesses, lie or die infamous 
 My style is so infamous, my style, it needs censorship 
 Dealer what's the business? Don't call, I'm busy bitch 
 Unless you 'bout your business, I'm tryna get some benjamins 
 Niggas say a lie on their way to the top 
 But you know you're too hot when they kidnap your pops 
 I guess that's sayin' a lot 
 But we ain't sayin' much, we just sendin' them shots, nigga 
 Death over dynasty, I'm talkin' major, not the minor league 
 And you the last of a dyin' breed 
 Follow caine like a menace to society 
 The richest nigga in the city cosignin' me 
 My shampoo days done showed me the way 
 As I pray, lord willin' but the killer's still vague 
 How can there be closure when the shooter's still in questionin' 
 Your niggas got rich, but when you died them niggas owed you 
 And everything I see is adding up to what you told me 
 I'm ramblin', tryna keep it to myself 
 I'm scramblin', still hard to hold the tears back 
 Never saw what I became, can't get them years back 
 Death before dishonor 
 Live long enough, it'll happen to you 
 Live long 
 It will, it will 
 It will, it will 
 Live long enough, it'll happen to you 
 Live long 
 It will, it will 
 It will, it will
