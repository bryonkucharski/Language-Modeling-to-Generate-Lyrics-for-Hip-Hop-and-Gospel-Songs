Y'all niggas lame for that, y'all niggas lame for that 
 Shoot a man in his back, should be ashamed of that 
 Young niggas banging back, young nigga banging back 
 Then we gon' fade to black then we gon' fade to black 
 I left the crib walking, drove a Mercedes back 
 You wasn't blessed with ambition so who you gon blame for that 
 Tried to get off the Act, still didn't know how to act 
 Still pull up in the back, sit my ass right in the back 
 Tell my driver when he open my door to take off his hat 
 Double saran everything so that you know it's a wrap 
 Double salute anybody that made it out the trap 
 Some of y'all probably still owe me from back 
 In the back in the back in the back in the back 
 I had that work right in front of me fuck all you niggas you wannabes 
 Most of you niggas is under mes, I'ma give ya ass some to see 
 My car don't have car keys, my crib got palm trees 
 Pussy smell like sardine you, need to get up of my lawn please 
 This a real nigga conversation, real nigga demonstration real niggas 
 No crystal or hilfigers, a bunch of ignorant lil' niggas 
 A bunch of red young tenders, dark skin queens, Puerto Rican princess's 
 Scratch my hand my palms itching, hit the dope start twitching 
 This a new kinda kitchen, marble countertops, see through fridge 
 3 thousand for the microwave, touchscreen stove lil biiiiitch! 
 Please don't make me relapse, make me start back trappin 
 Everybody in the city, saying that boy Tity done started back snapping 
 I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah 
 I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah 
 I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah 
 Tell her let's go have a bite, tell her let's go have a bite

 I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah 
 Treat every night like it's Saturday night, like it's Saturday night, yeah 
 I sat in the trap no one cooked at night, I treat my third stripe like its Kryptonite 
 I stopped serving sacks over qualified, have you ever seen a homicide? 
 Have you ever seen ya partna die? Have you ever been traumatized 
 Even at graduation I had a bookbag full of yams, tryna multiply 
 Enough of the negative actions, I got my paycheck off passion 
 I'm wearing 4 bracelets for fashion, don't think it's a race when I pass you 
 Stop talking that mafia shit, you never met Meech, J-bo or Illz 
 Luda charged me just to dip, was there when Chaka was swung on by Tip 
 I'm like oh shit we goon tear up this bitch, pull out a stick when you put up your fist 
 I'm like these niggas done fucked up my fit, funny how heaven and hell co exist 
 Funny how life can put you in the mix, I sold the pounds and go hustle the bricks 
 I booked studio with the trap money, Lil Wayne used to come get the bags from me 
 You still asking niggas for gas money, I look at these rappers like crash dummies 
 I look at these bitches that fuck with these rappers like bitch you just fucked with my last homie 
 Kesha can come get the last from me, Heaven can come get the last from me 
 Harmony can come get the last from me, Halo can come get the last from me MAMA! 
 I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah

 I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah 
 Treat every night like it's Saturday night, like it's Saturday night, yeah
