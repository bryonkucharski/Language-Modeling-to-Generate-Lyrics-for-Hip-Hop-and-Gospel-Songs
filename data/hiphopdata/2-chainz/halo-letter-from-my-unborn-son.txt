It's going down if I say so 
 I come to raise hell, call me Halo 
 I'm growing up 
 I'll be out in a couple months 
 See right now I'm hanging out in my mama front 
 Oh dad, I heard you used to like sports, yeah? 
 Used to keep money in a sports bag 
 Heaven said you ain't be home in some weeks, nigga 
 Don't go starting that shit with me, nigga 
 By the time I get bigger I need a father figure 
 Someone to lean on 
 Sipping lean with your team, (?) big screen on you 
 You looking like a fiend, ho 
 You rap about triple beams only 
 In every argument you try to make my mama seem wrong 
 Fuck you, nigga 
 (2And Harmony know I'm coming 
 She would no longer be the youngest 
 She keep kicking mama in the stomach 
 I'm gon kick your ass when I get there 
 You know sibling rivalry, it's all love 
 We'll all fight and then all hug 
 Like damn daddy got a ball court 
 I'm like damn daddy got a four wheeler 
 Damn daddy got a sports car 
 Damn daddy been wanting a lil nigga 
 We got enough land to find Sasquatch 
 Damn mommy, daddy making money 
 What the hell you complaining about? 
 So what if he was fucking with girls 
 As long as he don't even bring them hoes to the house 
 Heaven straight, Harmony cool 
 I can't wait to get my own room 
 I can't wait till home room 
 I can't wait I'll be home soon like 
 I can't wait to meet them, can't wait to meet them 
 I gotta hug now mom 
 Gotta hug GGG, get babysitted by nanna
