Every evening you will find him 
 Around our neighborhood. 
 It's the old dope peddler 
 That we know by doing good 
 Started off with a OZ 
 End up riding fo' deep 
 Pull up to that club like 
 Mothafucka ho you don't know me 
 I said I pull up to that club like 
 Mothafucka ho you don't know me 
 Started off with a OZ 
 End up riding fo' deep

 End up riding fo' deep 
 Pull up to that club like 
 Mothafucka ho you don't know me 
 I said I pull up to that club like 
 Mothafucka ho you don't know me 
 Most of my niggas got gold teeth 
 Most of my bitches got tattoos 
 Most of my niggas think cash rules 
 And I mess up hair dos like it's a pair of shoes 
 And I need a parachute when I'm up there 
 I'm in the trap 'cause I work there 
 Started off with a OZ 
 End up riding fo' deep 
 Pull up to that club like 
 Mothafucka ho you don't know me 
 I said I pull up to that club like 
 Mothafucka ho you don't know me

 End up riding fo' deep

 Pull up to that club like 
 Mothafucka ho you don't know me

 Mothafucka ho you don't know me 
 When the shades of night are falling, 
 Comes a fellow everyone knows, 
 It's the old dope peddler, 
 Spreading joy wherever he goes 
 See what these bitches looking like 
 Stick it in all crooked like 
 Louie V is my kyrptonite 
 Take ya bitch and I give her back 
 Give her this and I give her that 
 Fine wine and lobster tail 
 Candlelight and Chrisette Michele 
 Look at the pussy and play kiss and tell 
 Fix her hair then fix her nails 
 Even pay a few bills 
 Way I'm running shit man I should have a shoe deal 
 And my whole crew ill 
 Pockets on fat burger 
 Going so hard you'd think I mixed the Viagra with the Soda 
 Staying focused 
 Black and white ice, polar bear 
 You hold her hand and I hold her hair 
 I pull her close and I put it there 
 Started off with a OZ 
 End up riding fo' deep 
 Pull up to that club like 
 Mothafucka ho you don't know me
