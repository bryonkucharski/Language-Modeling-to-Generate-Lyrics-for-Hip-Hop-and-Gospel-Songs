 Dodgin all obstacles 
 Trappin at the Stop-N-Go 
 Boy you know you lame if you still ridin' stop and go 
 Disect the beat and then I turn it to a particle 
 Pardon though I'm hardin though

 Dollar hoes, white lookin' Madonna hoes 
 Dolce Gabbana, Ferragamo and the Prada hoes 
 College hoes on three, niggaz with a lot of dough

 Heres some food for thought, a little food for your soul 
 Like a comma, I love bein right next to O's

 Time to re-up, I got a hundred bands 
 I can't help it I'm addicted to the rubberbands 
 We sittin' high speakin' like we super human Benz 
 Cars mulatto, black on black Europeans 
 Too hard to swallow like UGKings and

 They say money is the root of all diseases 
 Well call the doctor I see honest in my thesis 
 Summer vacation, one trip two bricks 
 Baby momma sayin' I'm impatient my sons need shit 
 When you pull up to the front, all you see is whips 
 Diddy bop to the back all you see is zips 
 In Ziplocks, and garbage bags 
 Usher Raymond in this bitch yeah "I got it bad"

 See I'm from where you rob Peter to pay Paul 
 I'm yellin' fuck the world I woke up with my dick hard 
 Big dog, big broads all in my circumference 
 Pussy on lock down, I don't handcuff it 
 Sippin Grey Goose and we spendin mad ducats 
 Rubberband fetish get it in abundance
