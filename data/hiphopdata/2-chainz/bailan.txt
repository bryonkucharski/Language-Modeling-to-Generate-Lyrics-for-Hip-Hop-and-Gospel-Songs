You, you, you, you, you 
 Hate me 'cause I tell you the truth 
 Maybe your friends are confused 
 I'm gonna tell you the truth 
 Go ahead and goooo, bailan, bailan, bailan, bailan 
 Goooo, bailan, bailan, bailan, bailan 
 All week, keeping on, my mind is... 
 Going in, going in, going in, going in 
 Maybe now, but not next time 
 Going in, going in, going in, going in 
 There we go, that' it for sure 
 Going in, going in, going in, going in 
 Maybe just a little more 
 Going in, going in, going in, going in 
 Juicy, squeeze it, then juicy 
 Sipping on the D'usse 
 Rocking some Medusa, give a fuck what you say 
 Give a fuck what you say 
 In the club, I wrote this for the plug 
 I wrote this for a hater that was looking for some love 
 A DJ competition, I'm mixing in the kitchen 
 Now who gon' do the dishes 
 Bankroll thicker than Deelishis 
 You, you, you, you, you 
 Hate me 'cause I tell you the truth 
 Maybe your friends are confused 
 I'm gonna tell you the truth 
 Go ahead and goooo, bailan, bailan, bailan, bailan 
 Goooo, bailan, bailan, bailan, bailan 
 All week, keeping on, my mind is... 
 Going in, going in, going in, going in 
 Maybe now, but not next time 
 Going in, going in, going in, going in 
 There we go, that' it for sure 
 Going in, going in, going in, going in 
 Maybe just a little more 
 Going in, going in, going in, going in 
 Drug connotation in my population 
 I want a conversation, don't want no confrontation 
 Pull up in a hardtop, watch how I race it 
 Trap to the wrap like watch how I embrace it 
 Louis Vans on, they don't come with laces 
 And we talking straight shots, we don't need no chaser 
 Tell her I don't chase her, swap her, I replace it 
 Bracelet, this is Rollie, Rollie, this is bracelet 
 Pass the medication 
 Rounds upon rounds, I am nowhere around 
 I'm nowhere to be found 
 I'm on flights over lights, I'm so close up to Christ 
 I might ask for advice, I might ask for it twice 
 Look at my ice, I'm so nice, it's like Mardi Gras 
 Mama I shot me a man, please go hide the gun 
 When she ask me my number, I say I'm the one 
 Rushing summer to summer until someone come 
 You, you, you, you, you 
 Hate me 'cause I tell you the truth 
 Maybe your friends are confused 
 I'm gonna tell you the truth 
 Go ahead and goooo, bailan, bailan, bailan, bailan 
 Goooo, bailan, bailan, bailan, bailan 
 All week, keeping on, my mind is... 
 Going in, going in, going in, going in 
 Maybe now, but not next time 
 Going in, going in, going in, going in 
 There we go, that' it for sure 
 Going in, going in, going in, going in 
 Maybe just a little more 
 Going in, going in, going in, going in 
 Go ahead and touch the sky 
 Go ahead and touch the sky 
 Dancing where you are 
 Go ahead and touch the sky
