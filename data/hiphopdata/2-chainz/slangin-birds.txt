Everything that I got I got from slanging birds 
 (2 Chainz) 
 Niggas know I call my porsche the baby elephant 
 You ain't talking money then you got speech impediment 
 Everything I got I got from selling shit 
 And who I sold it to is irrelevant 
 Pocket full of Dead Presidents I'm With whatever 
 I pull my dick out and tell her sit wherever 
 I done stood on the block nigga from 9 to 9 
 And I sell a 9 at least 9 times 
 9Milla Clientel Look Like Thriller 
 If my baby mama cheating I Hope God with her 
 You not iler I'm Godzilla on hard liquor 
 My Penny loafers had nickels... UGH

 You know we tryna hide the 9s that's why the chickens dressed 
 I Had the lam Black and green like a parkeet
