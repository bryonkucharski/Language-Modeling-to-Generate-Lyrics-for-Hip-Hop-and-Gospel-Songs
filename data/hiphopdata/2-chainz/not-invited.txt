All of my hoes is exotic 
 None of your hoes is invited 
 All of my hoes is exotic 
 None of your hoes is invited 
 All of my hoes is exotic 
 None of your hoes is invited 
 I don't have to front 
 I park in the front with the trunk in the front 
 Make me a profit a month 
 Whether I get it or don't 
 I'ma go hard, I'ma stunt 
 I'm puttin' gas in the joint 
 I'm puttin' oil in the blunt 
 I do this shit for the Park 
 I do this shit for the Point 
 I do this shit for the 'Vard 
 I do this shit 'cause you boring 
 I am the man in this muthafucka 
 I got them bandz in this muthafucka 
 You know what I'm sayin', hand full of Xans 
 Nigga not playin' in this muthafucka 
 Put me a deuce in a Brisk tea 
 Couple of chains on the Crims tee 
 Tell me how I met a bitch one time and she talkin' 'bout she miss me 
 All of my hoes is exotic 
 None of your hoes is invited 
 All of my hoes is exotic 
 None of your hoes is invited 
 All of my hoes is exotic 
 None of your hoes is invited 
 All of my hoes is exotic 
 None of your hoes is invited 
 She fell in love with the Percocet 
 She like the one with a ten on it 
 She like the Benz with the fins on it 
 She like the Benz with the lens on it 
 She like the Benz with the rims on it 
 And my turbo got them twins on 'em 
 All of my partners got bandz on 'em 
 So tell me what the fuck you sayin' huh? 
 You exotic baby, you special 
 Go and send me some new pictures 
 You so damn fine, it's a damn crime, 
 You gon' end up on a news special 
 You exotic baby, I'm fuckin' with you 
 You exotic baby, I'm workin' with you 
 And I'm smokin' on exotic 
 Got Chanel on her body 
 Might meet her in the lobby, used the herb in my ashtray 
 "Give a fuck" is my last name, "I don't" is my first 
 This for my ones, like November first 
 Walk around with two cups, like I'm always thirsty 
 All of my hoes is exotic 
 None of your hoes is invited 
 All of my hoes is exotic 
 None of your hoes is invited 
 All of my hoes is exotic 
 None of your hoes is invited 
 All of my hoes is exotic 
 None of your hoes is invited 
 None of your hoes, none of your hoes 
 None of your hoes, none of your hoes 
 None of your hoes, none of your hoes 
 None of your hoes, none of your hoes 
 Ain't none of your hoes, none of your hoes 
 Ain't none of your hoes, none of your hoes 
 None of your hoes, none of your hoes 
 None of your hoes, none of your hoes 
 They can't get in, they can't get in 
 Yeah, It's a real nigga party 
 It's a real bitches party 
 See that vibe right here, you dig? 
 Thousand dollar shoes on your sofa 
 My other trap nigga watchin' Oprah 
 My other trap nigga watchin' Ricki Lake 
 I'm a trap nigga servin' shake and bake 
 I'm a trap nigga, serve you shake and bake 
 We in the back of the bando 
 Ammo like "Commando" 
 Pit bark in the front yard 
 Ain't no key for the top part 
 I'm allergic to cop cars 
 All these F's on my rims, fuck report cards
