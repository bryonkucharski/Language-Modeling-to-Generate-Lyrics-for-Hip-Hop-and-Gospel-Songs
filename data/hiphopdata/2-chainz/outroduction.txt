I'm blessed, some might say I'm lucky 
 I'm blessed, some might say I'm lucky 
 Every cents huffy, pockets on husky 
 Shawty don't trust me, I break hearts often 
 If you look at my pockets you a weight watcher 
 From a dishwasher to a kingpin 
 Remember how the scene end and how this thing is 
 Drugs backed in 'em mean them things in 
 Now it's duffle bags full of green men 
 I swear I ain't lying if my daddy hadn't died 
 He'd tell ya I had em' hooked like Kareem did 
 Two kids later, I mature like fine wine in the basement 
 Vino, different kind of pinot 
 Tried to stack c-note after c-note 
 I'm tryna make it count like a free throw after free throw 
 Line, it's a thin one between 
 Getting high and committing crimes 
 Let a nigga live 
 I've been locked up more rapping than I did tryna get a brick 
 (Fuck this shit) 
 I remember when I believed in me 
 What am I supposed to do? 
 Uh, now when the ones that didn't see me 
 They want a verse or two 
 Shit, what am I supposed to do? 
 Put 'em in a fucking hearse or two 
 I'm the illest, I wrote that shit in cursive too 
 And I smoke just to ease the pain 
 So hungry I used to try to eat the rain 
 Well at least until the pizza came 
 Or at least until polices came 
 Undercovers outside my momma yard 
 And all the guns is in Kesha's name 
 In Jesus's name I pray 
 I say that a couple times a day 
 When it's time to eat, when it's time to lay 
 And when it's daytime it ain't my time of day, uh 
 I heard my little big cousin mad at me 
 I call him little big 'cause he younger than me 
 But he big, he was the high school team captain 
 Didn't graduate but sometimes things happen 
 And whatever happen that was the worst day 
 And who know what was going on in the first place 
 I love and helped raise my nigga 
 This year forgot to call him on his birthday 
 It's hard to explain my new lifestyle 
 A partner lockdown, got a phone and an iPod 
 He called to tell me happy new years 
 I had to tell him nigga, it's March 
 We had similar stars 
 But I ain't figured his part 
 They had dough and we didn't 
 How did it dissolve, alka-seltzer 
 This is the outroduction 
 Niggas stab you in your back like acupuncture
