Yo yo... yo yo yo yooooooo... 2 Chaaaaaaaaiiiiiinnnzzzz 
 We gon' get it in, we gon' get it in 
 Started wit' a model, then I fucked her friend 
 Then I bought a condo, then I bought a Benz 
 Ballin' outta control we gon' get it in 
 Nigga ? bedroom try to play us on the cellphone 
 Ask me what's my alibi this big thick yellow redbone 
 Strawberry banana, we dance in our pajamas 
 And pose for the camera, making music no piano 
 Got keys on the counter, please don't get me started 
 Every beat I get on it end up dearly departed 
 Mack 11 shawty, Kawasaki balling 
 Tried to pop a wheelie and the Kawasaki falling 
 Money in my backpack, I'm too past that to go ask that 
 Fuck how much it cost, I got to go have that 
 Duck ass nigga, yeah... Aflac 
 And we getting paper baby can I get a hand-clap 
 Clap-clap-clap-clap-clap now I been booming out my traphouse 
 Nigga try to go and we gon' have to pull them thangs out 
 'Cause I got them chains out, them charms and them rings out 
 And if you been hustling, then we took the same route 
 First I bought a Beamer, then I bought some rims 
 Then I fucked a model, then I fucked her twin 
 See I don't give a fuck, we don't fuck wit' them 
 I'm yelling fuck the other side, we gon' get it in! 
 Talking on my iPhone wit' that shuffle on my iPod 
 Alligator belts when I flow no Izod 
 Walking wit' my chopper, I might need a tripod 
 Make ya dog look backwards nigga... my God 
 And know that I hustle all day 
 And hang on the west like Kanye 
 And I got techs like Georg-a, in my yellow jacket 
 Bitch don't act right I get her a yellow taxi 
 Niggas know what happen when you fucking wit' the captain 
 Niggas know I'm sushi, I'm raw, what's happening 
 Smoking on that cannabis, drinking on that lavender 
 And I'm getting to it every day that's on the calendar
