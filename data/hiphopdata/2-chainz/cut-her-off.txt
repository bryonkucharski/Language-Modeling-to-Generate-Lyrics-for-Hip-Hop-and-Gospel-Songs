 You ain't shit, actin' like you faithful but you're everybody's bitch 
 Everybody done hit, everybody did somethin' 
 Your ass butt naked, that's why I cut you off 
 I know the situation, I don't need no explanations

 You was hoin' so much, a nigga couldn't care about you 
 You thought I was playin' when I cut that bitch off 
 I'm just tryna get inside that hole like you're golf 
 Oh that girl too nasty, she gon' suck it 'til it's soft 
 Runnin' 'round with balls, woulda thought this was lacrosse 
 You can't tell me ain't the hottest in your city, that I know 
 I see these niggas hatin' but they love it on the low 
 Every city that I hit, them bitches, they're in the front row 
 I asked myself "Why he mad", but I found out that's his ho, that I know
