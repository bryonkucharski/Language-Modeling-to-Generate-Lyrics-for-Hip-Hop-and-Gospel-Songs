 Known to pull off and get head 
 Drippin so much sauce on your bitch look like she wettin' the bed

 Racks in my pockets, they lookin' like kneepads 
 Flexin my all white with Benjamin Franklin 
 Put the work steady blue cheese in the bag

 One thing I cannot do is go out sad 
 They know me but don't know my past 
 And if you know me you know I'm about my cash
