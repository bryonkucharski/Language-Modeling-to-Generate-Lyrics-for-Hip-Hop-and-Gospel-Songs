DJ Timi Timb, on the 1's and 2's 'bout to give it to ya 
 I try, survive 
 K9's outside 
 What's life, I strive 
 I do it, you lie 
 This me, fuck it 
 This me, fuck it 
 Like this, fuck it 
 Right here, fuck it 
 Get mine, take yours 
 Go far, go hard 
 Go home, big mansion, front look like a backyard 
 This me, fuck it 
 Touch me, bussin 
 My weed, musty 
 Treat the Porsche like a (?) 
 Listen ladies, if ya nigga lame, then I don't wanna fuck ya 
 Listen ladies, if you ain't wanna waste things, then I don't wanna hug ya 
 Big money, soldiers 
 Slept on me, Folgers 
 My girl, gorgeous 
 Both pockets, bulges 
 This me, that's right 
 Pulled up, stop light 
 Got out, aight, aight, aight 
 This me, fuck it 
 This me, fuck it 
 Like this, fuck it 
 Right here, fuck it 
 Timbo, great 
 Make beats like steak 
 Chef in tha booth 
 Make niggas a plate 
 Make niggas relate 
 Might dive in a lake 
 VA, banana clips, Planet of The Apes 
 Ain't no debate 
 Ride like freeway 
 Ride like DJ's 
 If money talks I'm on three way 
 Live life, get paid 
 Been high since 10th grade 
 Fuck with me get ya rent paid 
 Cuttin' up like a switchblade 
 This me, fuck it 
 This me, fuck it 
 Like this, fuck it 
 Right here, fuck it
