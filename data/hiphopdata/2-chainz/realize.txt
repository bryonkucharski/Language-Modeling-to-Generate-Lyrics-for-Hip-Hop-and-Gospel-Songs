I'm gonna cause pandemonium 
 Pick up the paper, custodian 
 This how Prince met Apollonia 
 Tryna fill up California kings 
 Hydrocodeine with the Visine 
 Master bedroom on the right wing 
 This a Philippe not a Breitling 
 Fuck her to sleep, she had pipe dreams 
 Yeah, this is the king of the trap 
 Yeah, I pull it straight out the hat 
 Yeah, everyone better take cover 
 Yeah, got rappers under attack 
 Uh, my daughters inherit arrogance 
 And they intelligent, that's a fact 
 Bought me a car February 1st 
 You already know it was black on black 
 I cover my scars with the tats on tats 
 You better back back, rat-tat-tat-tat-tat

 I went to Montgomery, with packs on back 
 Sent her to the store for some plastic bags 
 Sent her to the store for some rubber bands 
 I started pitching so easy 
 I throw the work to you underhand 
 Underworld, underground, underline

 Realize 
 A lot of these niggas tell real lies 
 They not about shit in real life 
 And that's something that I had to realize (Realize) 
 I had to reco-reco-recogni-i-ize it 
 (Reco-reco-recogni-i-ize) 
 They see me winning and now they don't liiike it

 Act like the love me, but hate me in pri-i-vate 
 I had to reco-reco-recogni-i-ize it

 I call this rock, Dwayne 
 Johnson, stop the playin' 
 Man, I cannot complain 
 I left my shades in Atlanta so I told my pilot to stop the plane 
 He bust a U in the air 
 She say she doin' it, where? 
 She wanna sit in my chair 
 But she could never be my heir 
 Checks, clear, Bible, swear 
 They ain't buggin', I go off 
 Asahd Khaled with the cloth 
 Dwayne Carter of the north 
 Dwayne Wade in the fourth 
 New dream house for mommy 
 Keep 'Caiah in Armani 
 Putting my nieces through college 
 This for Kellise and Imani 
 Look at these niggas I put on 
 All of these niggas I'm good on 
 My own two, what I stood on 
 That's why their necks what I'm keepin' my foot on 
 I've been winning 8 years consistently, at least respect it 
 Papoose wrote a Ether record 
 But I broke Aretha record 
 See this is chess, not checkers 
 You can not check the checkers 
 Did Nas clear that "Ether" record? 
 Nah, but I broke Aretha record 
 Realize 
 A lot of these niggas tell real lies
