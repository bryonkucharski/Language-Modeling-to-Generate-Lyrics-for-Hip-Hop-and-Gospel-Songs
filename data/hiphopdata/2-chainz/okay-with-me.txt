Holiday Season, bitch! 
 Don't play with me, bad bitches they stay with me 
 Wanna pop bottles all night with me, all day with me 
 Okay with me! 
 That's okay with me, yeah that's okay with me 
 Bring that shit back! 
 Don't play with me, bad bitches they stay with me 
 Wanna pop bottles all night with me, all day with me 
 Okay with me! 
 That's okay with me, yeah that's okay with me 
 White boys, dope boys, ballplayers, peons 
 Pull up in Europeans 
 Back-to-back like it's a re-run 
 White boys, dope boys, ballplayers, peons 
 Pull up in Europeans 
 Back-to-back like it's a re-run 
 My pull up game is disgusting 
 You pussy niggas disgust me 
 Smoking on loud in this mustard 
 Like Hammer: can't touch me 
 Like desert loud got bricks in Memphis 
 ? 
 Like a nigga in a casket I'm fresh to death 
 Intercept a whole shipment 
 Man Tity Boi on that pimp shit! 
 Like fast food, I eat quick 
 I told y'all, I got sweet bricks 
 I'm ready, like master disaster 
 Eenie Minie Moe, which car can go faster 
 My trap house I'm king of this castle 
 Yellow bitch fine and her ass a little fatter 
 Gucci Mane ain't never change champagne in my campaign 
 We flyer than 2 private planes 
 It's 2 Chainz and Gucci Mane 
 Okay with me, yeah that's okay with me 
 Shawty got them crab legs I got that Old Bay with me 
 And I got that K with me, I wish they would try bitch! 
 Some niggas selling wolf tickets and I won't even buy them shits! 
 I go hard competing, my bankroll conceited 
 Take you home complete her 
 Then I skeet her and delete her 
 Do it with no compassion 
 Do it without her asking 
 Yeah I'm from Atlanta 
 But my jewelry from Alaska! 
 I was born to be what I was gonna be 
 Forgiato's up under me 
 Concrete up on the deck 
 Gave the rear-view mirror a heart attack boom! 
 Bottom. Name a nigga out here hotter 
 Damn, that's one of my problems 
 Living like it's no tomorrow
