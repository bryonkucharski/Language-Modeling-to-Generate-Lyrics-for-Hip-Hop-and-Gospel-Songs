Mama, mama! 
 (Wha, What!) 
 You get that money out my pants last night? 
 (Boy! Naw I ain't get no money out yo pants! And quit yellin' at me!) 
 Ain't nobody hollin' at you! 
 I had a dream that rap wouldn't work 
 Woke up on the block, had to hit it with the fork 
 Skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr: hit it with the fork 
 Skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr: hit it with the fork 
 Rap don't work, records ain't bein' sold 
 So much money on me, it won't even fold 
 So much money on me, it won't even fold 
 So much money on me, it won't even fold 
 So much money on me, it won't even fold 
 So much money on me, it won't even fold 
 I got Medusa on my sneakers 
 My dick up like "nice to meet ya" 
 100K for a feature, hundred K's at my leisure 
 Then we aim at your people 
 I be higher than a eagle 
 When I'm sipping on that codeine 
 Free my nigga Sigel 
 Ridin' on a jet, headin' to that Costa 
 Soon as I land I be in that Testarossa 
 If I die tonight, you gon' see some flicks in Ghosta 
 I'm the man in my city, same thing in South Dakota 
 And I'm running up that check, show you how I do it 
 I drink red bitches, I don't drink Red Bulls 
 Man they tried to give me wings, but I already had some 
 I'm all that and then some, my trap house is my income 
 I had a dream that rap wouldn't work 
 Woke up on the block, had to hit it with the fork 
 Skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr: hit it with the fork 
 Skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr: hit it with the fork 
 Rap don't work, records ain't bein' sold 
 So much money on me, it won't even fold 
 So much money on me, it won't even fold 
 So much money on me, it won't even fold 
 So much money on me, it won't even fold 
 So much money on me, it won't even fold 
 I'm ballin' like Mr. Clean 
 I gotta keep my kitchen clean 
 God bless me like I'm finna sneeze 
 Doctor weigh me on a triple beam 
 D-boy in parenthesis 
 All gold in my Mr. T's 
 2 Chainz, two pinky rings 
 My trigger finger's like a lemon squeeze (Baow!) 
 Climax! Make your main ho my side-chick 
 I'm so high, your whore get hijacked 
 And my vision is Pyrex 
 I do it big like a 5X 
 Killed they ass with the eyepatch 
 I got bad bitches on my side 
 I done fucked around and got sidetracked 
 My first night, I spent five stacks 
 Next night I forgot to count 
 I'm so hot; who gon' put the fire out? 
 I'm the fireman, I put fire out 
 Got a pole in my basement 
 Tipped your girl like Malaya now 
 Ridin' on these motherfucka's until they blow my tires out 
 My wrist deserve a shout-out, I'm like "What up, wrist?" 
 My stove deserve a shout-out, I'm like "What up, stove?" 
 All this jewelry on then I'm out cold 
 So much money on me, it won't even fold! 
 I had a dream that rap wouldn't work 
 Woke up on the block, had to hit it with the fork 
 Skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr: hit it with the fork 
 Skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr: hit it with the fork 
 Rap don't work, records ain't bein' sold 
 So much money on me, it won't even fold 
 So much money on me, it won't even fold 
 So much money on me, it won't even fold 
 So much money on me, it won't even fold 
 So much money on me, it won't even fold
