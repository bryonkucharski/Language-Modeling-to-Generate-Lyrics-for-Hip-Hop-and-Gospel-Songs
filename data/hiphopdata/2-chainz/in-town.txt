Girl I'm on that clean shit, you already know 
 You ain't never seen this, I'm ready to go 
 I got 'em saying, I, I, I, I, I, I 
 I know I've been away 
 But I, I, I, I, I, I 
 I'm in your city today 
 I know you love me 
 And I know you're down 
 'Cause we always end up fucking Every time I'm in town 
 Every time I'm in town (Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh) 
 Every time I'm in town (Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh) 
 Baby I just landed, you gon pick me up 
 Heard you like to squirt, I might lick it up 
 Conspicuous, I speed it up 
 And I slow it down like I'm on Robitussin 
 I'm known for crushing, your know for blushing 
 Oh what was that 
 You blowing kisses, I throw 'em back, pull into that culdesac 
 Back then no chauffeur, back seat like a sofa 
 One leg on my shoulder, other leg and it's over 
 I know you love me 
 And I know you're down 
 'Cause we always end up fucking Every time I'm in town 
 Every time I'm in town (Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh) 
 Every time I'm in town (Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh) 
 Met her once and you missed me, girl you crazy 
 No makeup on, your still pretty lady 
 And you beautiful, inside and outside 
 I don't know if I should buy my wife a house, or make you my house wife 
 You call me, I come through 
 You pass out, I come too 
 Dippin it like fondue, spinach dip, cheese stick 
 Appetizers, entrees, it's you in that lingerie 
 As far as race, youse first place, I'm only on time for one date 
 I know you love me 
 And I know you're down 
 'Cause we always end up fucking Every time I'm in town 
 Every time I'm in town (Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh) 
 Every time I'm in town (Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh) 
 Girl I'm on that clean shit, you already know 
 You ain't never seen this, I'm ready to go 
 I got 'em saying, I, I, I, I, I, I 
 I know I've been away 
 But I, I, I, I, I, I 
 I'm in your city today
