 Addicted to the money smokin' loud from my prescription 
 Look at my position man I started off local

 Forty deep forty day forty nights 
 Sippin' dirty sprite 
 Married to the game that's my prototype 
 My polo white my four door white white rims 
 Lookin' like Casper 
 I'm the man bitch you can be the man after 
 I provide jobs like a contractor 
 One button make the car back up 
 See I'm a syrup sippin' animal, emcee cannibal 
 All I spit is gasoline, all my verses flammable (ugh!)

 PSA -- public service announcement 
 If you ain't gettin' no money get the hell from 'round me 
 You don't grind you don't eat check the logo 
 Duffel bag full of cash I'm hard like a porno 
 My sweater come from Polo 
 Sweat her that's a no-no 
 And no I'm not from D.C. but bitch you gotta go-go 
 I'm hard on 'em no homo 
 Pause -- smoke fo', pause -- smoke mo' I need to take a photo 
 Cam-er-a ready when I walk out the front do' 
 Last name respect first name utmost
