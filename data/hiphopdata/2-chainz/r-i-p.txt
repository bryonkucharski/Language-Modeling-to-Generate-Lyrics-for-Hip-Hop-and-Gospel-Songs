R.I.P we just killed the club 
 Drank patron out the bottle almost killed a thug 
 Right now I'm so high I can't feel the drugs 
 Too many haters in here, I don't feel the love 
 R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P we just killed the club 
 Took patron to the head almost killed a thug 
 I'm in a brand new drop top 'Rari with three bitches 
 Tired being in the middle of trial with three snitches 
 And I hit up every club in your city, where niggas at? 
 I be in every club in the hood, where niggas at? 
 Pull up, jump out stuntin like I was Baby 
 On my cocaine cowboy shit, like in the 80's 
 Who the nigga think he is Slick Rick or Dana Dane 
 Think he Rakim or somethin', look at his chain 
 Myself, from head to toe, I'm Dougie Fresh 
 Looking like I came to play, Mitchell and Ness 
 Any nigga with a watch like that, he need attention 
 Your man don't ball out like that, you need to bench him 
 R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P we just killed the club 
 Took patron to the head almost killed a thug 
 R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P we just killed the club 
 Took patron to the head almost killed a thug 
 I'm gone, don't know where I'm going 
 Pockets on extra big, they on Samoan 
 Got some bad bitches all in my section, just let some more in 
 And every nigga came in with me'll kick your door in 
 Roll up, pass it around like we Jamaican 
 Whole pounds strapped up in this bitch like we some Hatians 
 She got good head, good brains, good education 
 I'm drunker than a motherfucker, here's the situation: 1:45 am, the nights broken 
 By the time a nigga get to the crib, the mall open 
 Man the nerve of this high-ass bitch, she on the molly 
 She said she she want me to call her Ms. Berry, she think she Halle 
 R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P we just killed the club 
 Took patron to the head almost killed a thug 
 R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P we just killed the club 
 Took patron to the head almost killed a thug 
 Got a pocket full of Dead Prez 
 Attached to your girl like a .jpeg 
 Party scene turn to a murder scene 
 Keep shittin on niggas, need potty train, turn up, collard green 
 I'm on gasoline and I'm on that promethazine 
 Life ain't nothin' but a G thing 
 Switch lanes, get brain, hand down her g-string 
 I'm the type of nigga that's built to last 
 You fuck with me, Ill put my foot in your ass 
 I got a million in stash, I stack my money so tall 
 That you might need a giraffe 
 When you was countin' this cash, nigga! 
 R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P we just killed the club 
 Took patron to the head almost killed a thug
