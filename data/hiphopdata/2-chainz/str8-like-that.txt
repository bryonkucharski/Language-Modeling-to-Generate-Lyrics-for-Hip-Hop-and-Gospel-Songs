 We run it straight like that, who want it straight like that?

 DJ turn me up! Please don't turn me down 
 These niggas ain't hear me then, these niggas gonna hear me now 
 I got bad hoes in my section, these niggas wanna burn me down 
 So I'm gon' make it sparkle, tell the waiter come serve me now 
 Just Ciroc bottles and top models, all real niggas that pop hollows 
 I pulled up and I drop-topped, and my bad bitch just popped out 
 And like Alakazam! This shit way out of my hands! 
 And I'm with black card shawty, vroom-vroom jumpin' out of that Lamb 
 Well damn, it's YSL in my shirt, fly as hell off Earth 
 Y'all niggas smoking on dirt, I'm on probation poppin' on Perc 
 We sippin that lean, the fuck y'all mean 
 My money so long and my bitch so mean 
 We smokin' on strong and I'm with my team 
 And We turned up, got your bitch tryna fuck 
 We do it straight like that, get money straight like that 
 We run it straight like that, who want it straight like that?

 All I do is turn up, I'm about to show y'all 
 Early bird get the worm, I'm up way before y'all 
 I don't even know y'all, riding with the doors off 
 Fuck her on the lean, then I fucking doze off! 
 The dope man is my role model, I had a TV on top of my floor model 
 That bitch would show, fiends used to smoke dope out the antenna 
 Closet full of amphibians, aim at it and hit it 
 Difference between me and your girl: my girl, ass thicker 
 Life sentence my trunk, real niggas respect it 
 Dumb charm on my necklace, stupid watch on my left wrist 
 I ain't have a lot so I brag a lot, when I got a lot, I pop a lot 
 I bought a drop, bought some pussy, get head in the parking lot 
 My rhyme style's unorthodox, my weed stank no Tic-Tac 
 Asking me where I get that, Gucci sat on my flip flap! 
 Paint job cost 10 stacks, rims cost me another ten 
 So tell a friend to tell a friend to tell a friend to tell a friend 
 We do it straight like that, get money straight like that 
 We run it straight like that, who want it straight like that?

 Straight like that nigga, straight like that 
 No birthday get cake like that 
 And I ball hard niggas hate like that 
 'Cause I drop that work, come straight right back like whoa 
 I peeled off in the Bent, came straight right back in a Rolls 
 Peeled off with ya bitch, came straight right back with y'all 
 Nigga we share that bitch, 10 big chains I don't wear that shit 
 Big Glock 9, I air that shit 
 And a big V12, I steer that shit like skurrrt 
 And they be like word, I'm with a bad bitch, but I wouldn't wife her 
 My neck all froze and my wrist like burr 
 And my shit so cold, Ima need a light fur 
 We turned up to the max, turned up on them racks 
 Got shorty all on that pole and she gon turn up for these stacks 
 'Cause I'm ballin, like Spalding 
 My wrist flooded, New Orleans 
 And I'm shittin on 'em, no toilet 
 And no referee, I called it 
 We do it straight like that, get money straight like that 
 We run it straight like that, who want it straight like that? 
 We do it straight like that, get money straight like that
