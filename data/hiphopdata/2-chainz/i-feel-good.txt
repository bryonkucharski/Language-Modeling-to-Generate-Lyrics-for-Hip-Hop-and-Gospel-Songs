Whip cold, get dough, different flows 
 I killed the last beat, I'm out on parole 
 You know the code, point scene, money gone 
 You know what I'm on, pass the styrofoam 
 Oh I feel good, oh I feel good 
 Oh I feel good, oh I feel good 
 Oh I feel good, oh I feel good 
 Oh I feel good, oh I feel good 
 Hey, motivated, woke up like I'm gonna make it 
 I had a dream I seen Serena playin' tennis naked 
 Formulate a plot, conversate with Glocks 
 Bang bang motherfucker this is gun talk 
 I got a fresh pair step and get fresh air 
 Yves St. Laurent spring collect wear, yeah 
 And I've been on my paper route 
 A lot of zeros in my motherfuckin' bank account 
 Oh I feel good, oh I feel good 
 Oh I feel good, oh I feel good 
 Oh I feel good, oh I feel good 
 Oh I feel good, oh I feel good 
 One of a kind, Bond Number Nine 
 Powder on my chest, diamonds on my neck 
 I drop the work and make it back flip 
 I'm a walking poster child for Saks Fifth 
 In the catalog where it say next year 
 Put my order in this is Corvette gear 
 In the T top with her knees cocked 
 I'm so motherfuckin' high nigga tree top 
 Oh I feel good, oh I feel good 
 Oh I feel good, oh I feel good 
 Oh I feel good, oh I feel good 
 Oh I feel good, oh I feel good 
 I feel good, laid back, feet up 
 I know my money low, I just re'd up 
 Got my car, no keys but 
 Left the Gucci store, all G'd up 
 Yeah, on to the next one 
 If you see smoke, that's our section 
 If you see ho's, that's our selection 
 At the strip club during a recession 
 Oh I feel good, oh I feel good 
 Oh I feel good, oh I feel good 
 Oh I feel good, oh I feel good 
 Oh I feel good, oh I feel good
