I like to take it one day at a time 
 I like to take it one, ooh 
 Yea, I like to take it one day at a time 
 I like to take it one 
 (Verse 1: 2 Chainz) 
 Broken home, tell me what the fuck is wrong 
 Now I gotta charge a brick for a song 
 Trap guy, turned into a rap guy 
 No suit on but I still got trap ties 
 Argyles, pastels and some neckties 
 Shawty on the pill, X-file 
 40 hit 'em, leave 'em wet, baptised 
 And you know I'm a sucker for long hair and wet thighs 
 Mama see the baby, this is karmasutra 
 I got a present for you boo you looking at the future 
 As far as the past, nevermind that 
 I don't know who's finer, you or this wine glass 
 And you must rewind that if you don't get it 
 Got a taste of the good life and tracks is what I'm eatin 
 My chromosomes read Georgia Dome 
 Icy watch, I don't mind spending time alone 
 (Verse 2: Jadakiss) 
 Yo, get the clip out of the ashtray, put it in the air 
 Grab my cellphone, call my engineer 
 Yea, last night I was on one 
 Quick carwash, then I make a mall run 
 I'm a different brother 
 Louie store spending chips on some kicks 
 I already got, different color 
 40 cally chrome, on deck 
 All the Kush gone, gotta collect 
 On this mean five team parlay that a bush gone 
 30 minutes in the trap is a half a brick 
 Always hustle to get it 
 I never ask for shit 
 If it's family or money I might have to flip 
 I'm a say it if it's on my mind 
 I like to take it one day at a time 
 (Verse 3: 2 Chainz) 
 Never on the guest list 
 Always unexpected 
 In so many checks 
 I should make a checklist 
 Looking at these emcees' like they should make a deathwish 
 Got my girl in the kitchen, cooking ambidextrious 
 Left wrist, right wrist 
 Whip that, white bitch 
 This is a lifestyle, I didn't have to right this 
 Look at my hue blow, watch how the light hit 
 Look at my new ho, watch how the light hit 
 I done did the dollars up, die nigga 
 Too dehydrated to cry nigga 
 I was struggling, had a time limit 
 I wish this Aquafina bottle had wine in it 
 I wish that pussy had a sign in it 
 That said, "want it, if you hit it then you mine nigga" 
 Damn, that crazy bitch on that crazy shit 
 If you don't make money it don't make sense
