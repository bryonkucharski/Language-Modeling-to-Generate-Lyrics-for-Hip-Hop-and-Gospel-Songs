I wouldn't even... 
 I wouldn't even be here without that mothafuckin' door 
 We doing numbers, holmes 
 5540, we doing numbers, holmes 
 You can look that shit up, you can research that shit 
 Another day we gotta get it, 'notha day we gotta get it 
 I say 'notha day we gotta get it, 'notha day we gotta get it 
 Can't forget how I fucking had the door swinging 
 Can't forget how I fucking had the door swinging 
 No doorbell, we had the cameras included 
 No hibachi, all we had is some tuna fish 
 Moved up a level, then I stepped up my grind 
 Got to the top, ain't nobody around 
 When I look down, all I see is some sucka shit 
 And I'ma run shit, I put that on my bucket list 
 Adidas streetball, all the foreigns with the straps 
 Before the dreadlocks, I had the cornrows to the back 
 Used to sit on a broke down Camaro with packs 
 Told her, "Turn around," even though she had his name tatted 
 That's the way that it was, had a way with the girls 
 Had a felony before you knew what a felony was 
 You was taking the shots, you was feeling the buzz 
 Got so much in the stash spot, I could fill up a bus 
 Got gorillas with us, got chinchillas with us 
 No pretenders with us, got the winners with us, yeah 
 Another day we gotta get it, 'notha day we gotta get it 
 I say 'notha day we gotta get it, 'notha day we gotta get it 
 Can't forget how I fucking had the door swinging 
 Can't forget how I fucking had the door swinging 
 Another day we gotta get it, 'notha day we gotta get it 
 I say 'notha day we gotta get it, 'notha day we gotta get it 
 Can't forget how I fucking had the door swinging 
 Can't forget how I fucking had the door swinging 
 Somebody watching the front door 
 Yeah I went to college and sold dope 
 Sold narcotics, a boat load 
 And all us felons and can't vote 
 Yeah I'm from the cut, I'm cutthroat 
 All up in the crowd, Frank Lucas fur coat 
 Yeah, sipping muddy like a mothafuckin' Merlot 
 Under the influence, I stayed on the first floor, first floor 
 Wait, first 48, hard to see my face, diamonds in the way 
 This is MMA, I just beat the case 
 In and out the nail salon, she got her nails polished 
 Turn up in tennis shoes, turn up in red bottoms 
 Turn up in red bottoms, turn up, turn up in red bottoms 
 She turn up in red bottoms, yeah what? 
 A nigga a hustler, now the feds got him 
 You bring the rubber bands, I bring the money counter 
 Another day we gotta get it, 'notha day we gotta get it 
 I say 'notha day we gotta get it, 'notha day we gotta get it 
 Can't forget how I fucking had the door swinging 
 Can't forget how I fucking had the door swinging 
 Another day we gotta get it, 'notha day we gotta get it 
 I say 'notha day we gotta get it, 'notha day we gotta get it 
 Can't forget how I fucking had the door swinging 
 Can't forget how I fucking had the door swinging
