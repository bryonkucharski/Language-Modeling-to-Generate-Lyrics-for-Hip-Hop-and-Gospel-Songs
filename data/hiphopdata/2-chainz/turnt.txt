People think I'm crazy 
 But I love you 'cause you crazy too 
 (Radio Killa!) 
 Red light special, undress me under the candle light 
 Turnt up in this bidness 
 Watch me do all of them things you like 
 I'm ready to go, ready to blow like Grammy night 
 In the back of that limousine 
 Billy bob, and Angeline 
 All you gotta do, is the say the word 
 And I'll be right there on ya 
 All you gotta do, is the say the word 
 And I'll be right there for ya 
 Do this while I do that, we like good tru dat 
 Come on baby be you, get on it while I see you 
 Turn up, all the way to the ceiling 
 Burn up, till you ain't got no feeling 
 On my phone, let's hear it 
 Talkin' 'bout you gon' kill it 
 Beat it up, until I black out 
 Cash out, watch out 
 I need that 
 Sexy (Ratchet) Sophisticated (Ratchet) 
 That black leather 
 When it's hot outside in the summer time (Ratchet) 
 She need that cocky (Ratchet) 
 Ready to cock back (Ratchet) 
 That drop top in December, or mid winter (Ratchet) 
 Turnt up, turnt up, turnt up, boy 
 Turnt up, turnt up, turnt up, boy 
 Loving everything you do 
 Baby I'm in love with you 
 Turnt up, turnt up, turnt up, boy 
 Turnt up, turnt up, turnt up, boy 
 People think I'm crazy 
 But I love you 'cause you crazy too 
 You're my black light special 
 She hotter than a flame tonight 
 Burn up in this ho 
 And watch her do all the things I like 
 Say you the reason why 
 All of these rap niggas start singing 
 She said you the reason why 
 All of these cute girls got babies 
 All you gotta do is say what's happening 
 And I'll be right there baby 
 All you gotta do is say what's popping 
 And I'll be right there shorty 
 On the phone like 
 Siri, I told you I was gon' kill it 
 Got my chains all on that jelly 
 Where Michelle at? Where Kelly? 
 I need that 
 Sexy (Ratchet) Sophisticated (Ratchet) 
 That black leather 
 When it's hot outside in the summer time (Ratchet) 
 She need that cocky (Ratchet) 
 Ready to cock back (Ratchet) 
 That drop top in December, or mid winter (Ratchet) 
 Turnt up, turnt up, turnt up, boy 
 Turnt up, turnt up, turnt up, boy 
 Loving everything you do 
 Baby I'm in love with you 
 Turnt up, turnt up, turnt up, boy 
 Turnt up, turnt up, turnt up, boy 
 People think I'm crazy 
 But I love you 'cause you crazy too 
 Got a picnic table my automo 
 Pull up, blow the horn "Girl we gotta go" 
 You come out lookin' like a Pot 'o Gold 
 Now they tryna cramp our style, Charley Horse 
 I'm like "What's yo name? What's yo phone number?" 
 I kill that thang whoa, Manslaughter 
 You so sexy man I ain't flexin' 
 Shorty I'll drink your bath water 
 Ferragamo's are my loafers 
 Got my loafers on the sofa 
 And I'm drinkin' out the bottle 
 Man I'm gonna need a bib 
 Lookin' like a kid, tell you what it is 
 Tell you where to go, man I tell you what I did 
 You ain't kickin' it, you get kicked out 
 I don't bring sand to my beach house 
 And your body must be anticipated 
 'Cause it already done leaked out 
 I need that 
 Sexy (Ratchet) Sophisticated (Ratchet) 
 That black leather 
 When it's hot outside in the summer time (Ratchet) 
 I need that cocky (Ratchet) 
 Ready to cock back (Ratchet) 
 That drop top in December, or mid winter (Ratchet) 
 Turnt up, turnt up, turnt up, boy 
 Turnt up, turnt up, turnt up, boy 
 Loving everything you do 
 Baby I'm in love with you 
 Turnt up, turnt up, turnt up, boy 
 Turnt up, turnt up, turnt up, boy 
 People think I'm crazy 
 But I love you 'cause you crazy too
