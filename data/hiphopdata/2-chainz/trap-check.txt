 Foreign car check, foreign bitch check 
 Rolex check, gold around my neck 
 Juju on the diamond, my umbrella's designer 
 Stand on your recliner, pourin' all the wine up 
 Yea I used to pitch, you should see my wind up 
 Nigga fuck with me ain't no telling where you wind up 
 It's all love, positive vibes 
 Walking through the airport in crocodile slides 
 Wet floor signs, hands on thighs 
 If you got a check put your hands up high

 Come on, come on, come on 
 I rock the microphone, I had to thank the Lord 
 I am in rare form, I had to get it on 
 You never feed me, I use my own seasoning 
 Autograph cleavage, how many girls believe you? 
 How many girls you tried, I know a girl you lied to 
 She wants your ass to die, I look you dead in your eye 
 It's real nigga season, it's right after Easter 
 Might buy me a Regal, put that on my Visa 
 I need me some singles, don't care if you're single 
 Take you and mingle, take you to Neiman's 
 We hit the bars tonight, look at the roof on the Wraith 
 It look like the stars at night, yeah
