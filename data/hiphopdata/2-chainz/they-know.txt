Paid $100 for some head, nigga, Say you ain't did it! 
 I know a lick at 4 mil', nigga, Say you ain't with it! 
 Now if we hit this lick, nigga, & you don't want to split it 
 Then it's bow, bow, bow to your motherfuckin' fitted, now! 
 I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck! 
 I pull up in that truck, Pull up in that truck 
 I run that bitch over, call it Trukfit 
 And yeah I'm on my own, I'm screamin' "Fuck it" 
 Fuck it, I'm whippin' it crazy 
 I'm ridin' the foreign, I'm doin' 180 
 My chain so heavy, my brain so deadly 
 Type of nigga buy the watch and change the bezzy 
 They ain't never seen me comin' like this 
 Smokin' on that gasoline in the VIP 
 They need ding-a-ling for the trampoline 
 Cause all these bitches want to do is jump on the dick 
 I hop over fence, I'm offended by co-defendants 
 Drink codeine for mornin' sickness 
 Your dad was a motherfuckin' snitch, so nigga, you were born a witness 
 Allstate, accident forgiveness 
 Say my name by accident, We actin' ignorant 
 Doing a drive-by while you playin' different 
 This that Me Time at the finest 
 You won't beat me or see me whinin' 
 I am gangsta like the Raiders cap with a Jheri Curl on the side 
 I like thighs and breasts, I hide from stress 
 I don't even know where my phone at 
 Crib so motherfuckin' big, I don't even know where my room at! 
 Whip so fast they say 
 there he go 
 Bitch so bad, man, I think she know 
 Turned 100 to a mill, man I think they know 
 Ducking on the low, man, I think they know 
 I think they know, I think they know 
 I think they know, yeah yeah, I think they know 
 I think they know, I think they know 
 I think they know, yeah yeah, I think they know 
 I think they know it, if they don't then fuck it I show it 
 Blow it like you owe it, ordered a case of Moet 
 Y'all get to going back to back for us 
 All black like I'm wanted 
 Got your bitch zoning, send her back in the morning 
 That money coming, trying to stack it enormous 
 You niggas pussy, fucking rat on your homies 
 I think they know it, they know it, they know it 
 I got a plane that's sittin' round the corner 
 I got some bitches here from California 
 Got on my chains, I'm lookin' like a dope boy 
 These niggas don't want it, I put that on mañana 
 My chain into 100, my belt Ferragamo 
 Go to LA, meet the plug at Katanas 
 I'm still the king of my city and they know it 
 And I paint pictures with these words, I'm a poet 
 And I drop the top on my whip, and we soarin' 
 A 50 a check then I'm in it, if niggas stay with it then they get extorted 
 And I'm gone 
 Whip so fast they say 
 there he go 
 Bitch so bad, man, I think she know 
 Turned 100 to a mill, man I think they know 
 Ducking on the low, man, I think they know 
 I think they know, I think they know 
 I think they know, yeah yeah, I think they know 
 I think they know, I think they know 
 I think they know, yeah yeah, I think they know
