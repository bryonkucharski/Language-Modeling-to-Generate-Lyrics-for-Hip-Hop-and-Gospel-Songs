Money machine at the bank, I just made me a deposit 
 Fucked that bitch right on the sink 
 Is it the pussy or is it the faucet? 
 I just left the hotel, never let ho in mi casa 
 All this designer shit it's like a crib in my closet 
 I got a crib in my closet, got a crib in my closet 
 Man, all this fuckin' gear it's like a crib in my closet 
 My Nike shoebox filled with rubber bands 
 That mean my Nike shoebox is my ATM 
 Fuck it, I said it, I'm winning, downsouth MC Ren 
 I might buy some Timbs, or peanut butter MCM 
 Raised down the street from a crack house 
 Pull her hair weave 'til the track out 
 Treat the rap game like a trap game 
 Tryna make a yellow ho tap out 
 I got Dolce, I ain't even worn yet, codeine ain't even po' yet 
 I could spend millions of dollars, and still won't even be poor yet 
 Yeah, I'm a motherfucking poet, riding now, motherfucker Ol'Nat 
 A nigga wearing a Versace shirt, man that's a motherfucking throwback 
 I got a crib in my closet, got a crib in my closet 
 All designer shit, I got a crib in my closet 
 I got a crib in my closet, got a crib in my closet 
 Man, all designer shit, I got a crib 
 All designer shit, all designer shit I got a crib 
 All designer shit, all designer shit I got a crib 
 All designer shit, all designer shit I got a crib in my closet 
 All designer shit, all designer shit, I got a crib in my closet, bitch 
 Since rappin' turn to fashion I don't know what happen 
 Or mishappens 
 Matching turned to swagging, he exposed the world to trappin' 
 Picture poles and tactics 
 Ho, this that click click, finna' blow this backwards 
 Money, hoes and fabrics 
 Strolling past like 
 fuck yo photo caption 
 If ye ain't got it then you bragging, that's automatic 
 I see no need for me to Tweet, these bitches know my status 
 I'm the shit, all designer shit, got all kinds of shit 
 Got Prada around from 1999 and shit, bet you won't find the shit 
 I'm on my Anna shit, that's Wintour, it's dressed like, it's Met Ball 
 I'm in Vogue, this winter, the runway, no insta 
 Got a crib in my closet, Spanish chick in my casa 
 So much space in my closet, fit your crib in my closet 
 I got a crib in my closet, got a crib in my closet 
 All designer shit, I got a crib in my closet 
 I got a crib in my closet, got a crib in my closet 
 Man, all designer shit, I got a crib 
 All designer shit, all designer shit I got a crib 
 All designer shit, all designer shit I got a crib 
 All designer shit, all designer shit I got a crib in my closet 
 All designer shit, all designer shit, I got a crib in my closet, bitch 
 I got more sneakers than niggas, over 4,000 pairs 
 Most all white like the Royal Audemars 
 Got a crib in my closet, hustle every day, nigga 
 If you work with them people I'm unavailable, nigga 
 You smell like pork in Mecca, Lord be my protector 
 Second row at the fight, bitch get on my level 
 Larry Merchant my nigga, I got Holyfield money 
 Finger your girl at Coachella, gotta roll in that for me 
 You should see me in Lennox, I shop 'til I drop 
 Spent so much on the watch, had a seizure in shock 
 Wake up and ball, watch how I walk 
 Money all on my mind, call 'em lucrative thoughts 
 I got a crib in my closet, got a crib in my closet 
 All designer shit, I got a crib in my closet 
 I got a crib in my closet, got a crib in my closet 
 Man, all designer shit, I got a crib 
 All designer shit, all designer shit I got a crib 
 All designer shit, all designer shit I got a crib 
 All designer shit, all designer shit I got a crib in my closet 
 All designer shit, all designer shit, I got a crib in my closet, bitch
