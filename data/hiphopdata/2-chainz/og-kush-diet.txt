Sunbathing with a Rollie on, tan all on my tattoos 
 All my 16s cashews, V12 when I pass you 
 Reminiscing about the Motorollas 
 Weed stronger than a Coca-Cola 
 Wait up, bitch, hold up, hold up 
 You ain't there to hold the pole up 
 OG kush diet, OG kush diet 
 OG kush diet, OG kush diet 
 My partna just died, my partna just died 
 Nothin' else to do but get high, fuck 
 I'm 'bout to pour out some liquor 
 I'm 'bout to pour out some lean 
 I got blue cheese in my jeans 
 I bought my queen Celine 
 I got my team Supreme 
 It ain't no in between 
 You either in or you out, I took a different route 
 I had to figure it out, I went to picking them out, you, you 
 Fuck what you thinking, fuck what you thinking 
 Come to the bank, come through like Brinks 
 I might take a can of paint and go paint the white house 
 I might take a can of paint and go paint the white house 
 Presidential prolly tickled, laughing 'bout who popped the pistol 
 That's the issue, just got a rental, just for instrumentals 
 I'ma keep the bitch till December 
 And park it on Broadway, away from the hallway 
 Away from the 'partments, away from the arcades 
 We don't play games with them boys 
 We bring the pain to them boys 
 I caught a plane with them boys 
 I taught the game to them boys 
 I am ashamed of them boys 
 Blame it on fame, blame it on whatever you wanna blame 
 I'm smart and insane, imagine a genius that don't have a brain 
 That live off of resources, that learned off of geek sources 
 I do play with 3 persons, I got it from researching 
 I'm fresher than detergent, I'm fresher than each person 
 I walk out and eat Church's, gig without rehearsing 
 Watch how I resurface, watch how I rework it, gas 
 I'm fresher than detergent, I'm fresher than each person 
 I walk out and eat churches, gig without rehearsing 
 Watch how I resurface, watch how I rework it, Gas

 Yeah, your favorite rapper's got no talent 
 Homeboy got coke habits 
 Used to drive a Porsche till I found out it was made by Volkswagen 
 This here is a toe tag 'em, Tity Boi gon' and toe tag 'em 
 Go ahead, hook they ass up to the tow truck 
 Let them know this a throat slashing 
 Your baby mama got no passion 
 Her best friend act old fashioned 
 Tell her take them panties off when she walk around my boat laughing 
 I'm V.I.P. at the yacht club, nigga you look like you not loved 
 Stars in my double R so clean I drive in white gloves 
 Sea bass with the white sauce, hopped out, get wiped off 
 Presence been felt everywhere 
 Except let me see, yeah the White House 
 Space age like 8 ball, MJG, Nate Dogg 
 Sippin' quavo, ridin' offsets, guess I'm 'bout to take off 
 OG kush diet, OG kush diet 
 OG kush diet, OG kush diet 
 My partna just died, my partna just died 
 Nothin' else to do but get high, fuck 
 Fuck what you thinking, fuck what you thinking 
 Come to the bank, come through like Brinks
