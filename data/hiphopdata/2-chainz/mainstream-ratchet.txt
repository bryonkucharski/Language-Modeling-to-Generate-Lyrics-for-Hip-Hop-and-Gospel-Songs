Last night I bought the supermodel 
 Got head on the way home 
 She left her other friends at the club 
 Got home, and I fucked her with my chains on 
 And that's ratchet huh? 
 Her ass so big it look like she trying to walk backwards bruh 
 (Whoa bring it back) 
 Take your bitch like I'm the dog catcher 
 Take your ass to the mall after 
 Spa day, shawty 
 Kill that pussy, pallbearer 
 You from that RuPaul era 
 I'm from that hell nah era 
 Real niggas say true 
 Real niggas ain't you 
 I ride around with that yapper on me 
 Gun clad with my Glock up on me 
 Surround your ass with so many shots 
 You'll be claustrophobic 
 Crib so big a dinosaur can run through that shit 
 I'm a shark, and you a tuna fish 
 My paper up, got your girl with her ankles up 
 Gangster boy 
 She got her T-shirt and her panties on 
 She trying to smell my cologne 
 I can fuck her anywhere I want 
 I even fuck her on the floor 
 And that's ratchet huh? 
 Her ass so big it look like she trying to walk backwards bruh 
 (Whoa bring it back) 
 I'm on top like a toupée 
 You on the side like a toothache 
 Box your ass, suitcase 
 I'm real, you ain't 
 Calamari, crab cakes 
 My closet the size of your damn place 
 You lookin' at a star 
 I wish that they could add space 
 I'm getting money, fast pace 
 My hoes gave my cash straight 
 He can't ball, castrate 
 She the opposite of last place 
 Do it, bust it open, slow it down, Robitussin 
 My girl got a big ass 
 Your girl got back pockets touching 
 I want a dollar, I want everything 
 Balls out, I let her hang 
 Went shopping for a wedding ring 
 Went on a double date with Molly and Mary Jane 
 And that's ratchet huh? 
 Her ass so big it look like she trying to walk backwards bruh 
 If you patch a weed that's ratchet 
 My last album was classic 
 Shawty on my dica 
 Backwards spells acid 
 She pop a P like a zany 
 She'll use no hands and no panties 
 She rock like nose candy 
 You fuck with me, ain't no plan B 
 I'm a D boy with a degree 
 I sold dope in my momma's home 
 My girl pussy deep (deep) 
 So right there is my comfort zone 
 Born alone, die alone 
 Mud in my styrofoam 
 She got on top of me like a stage, 
 I said use my dick as a microphone
