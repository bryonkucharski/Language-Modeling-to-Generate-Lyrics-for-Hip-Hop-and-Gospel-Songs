Sometimes I have them thoughts 
 Like I'm too real for this shit 
 Labels keep callin' 
 I need 2 mil for this shit! 
 Took a mixtape 
 Turned it to a mansion 
 Then I took my last pack 
 And it turned into gymnastics 
 The crazy thing about it 
 I been knew I had it 
 I was being patient, y'all was being stagnant 
 The crazy thing about it 
 I been gettin' money 
 I been gettin' pussy 
 Shades cost 600 
 The crazy thing about it 
 I don't need nobody 
 I don't need no co-signer 
 Talking 'bout I got 'em 
 The crazy thing about it 
 Everything been crazy 
 My girl cousin died 
 Now who gon' take care of them babies 
 A-Town, we got one 
 Westside, we got one 
 Eastside, we got one 
 Southside, we got one 
 Got one, I got one 
 This pistol on me, I got one 
 This check homie, I got one 
 Respect homie, I got one 
 A-Town, we got one 
 Westside, we got one 
 Eastside, we got one 
 Southside, we got one 
 Got one, I got one 
 This pistol on me, I got one 
 This check homie, I got one 
 Respect homie, I got one 
 This polo, not Izod 
 I get dough like Tae Kwon 
 Asking me what I'm on 
 I say my bank account is on steroids 
 Trappin' off my Android 
 Tryin' not to go fed for it 
 'Cause I'm so high, talkin' I'm so fly 
 I don't know if I should l land for it 
 Addicted to codeine 
 My side effect is a red girl 
 If I buy the pussy you payin' for it 
 Put your head through the headboard 
 I say it but, I don't get no cred for it 
 Pull up in that short bus 
 Tell 'em this a sped tour 
 A-Town, we got one 
 Westside, we got one 
 Eastside, we got one 
 Southside, we got one 
 Got one, I got one 
 This pistol on me, I got one 
 This check homie, I got one 
 Respect homie, I got one 
 A-Town, we got one 
 Westside, we got one 
 Eastside, we got one 
 Southside, we got one 
 Got one, I got one 
 This pistol on me, I got one 
 This check homie, I got one 
 Respect homie, I got one
