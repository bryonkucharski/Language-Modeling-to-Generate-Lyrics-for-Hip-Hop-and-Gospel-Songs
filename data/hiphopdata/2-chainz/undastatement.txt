They say I run the streets 
 I tell 'em no wonder 
 The cheapest thang I got on is my belt and it's 400 
 Real recognize real and you don't look familiar 
 If my girl worked at a spa, man she still wouldn't feel ya 
 Cocaine flow, they done dropped me in the pot 
 I came out hard and I sold out the block 
 Tity 2 Chainz, I been killin' hairdos 
 So many dates on my calendar it looks tattooed 
 Got my mind on my moolah 
 My Tech 9 got a cooler 
 They scratching they medullah 
 They like how the fuck you do ya 
 Don't make me number 2 ya 
 Okay, I need some Charmin 
 I got swag for sale and I'm giving niggas bargains 
 Rappers are my target 
 My flow so retarded 
 Need a handicap sticker for my 16s when I park 'em 
 When she in the front I make her put in reverse 
 And if that pussy good then I'll put it in a verse 
 And I'm killing these niggas, Put 'em in the dirt 
 And yeah, I'm killing pussy we should do it in a hearse 
 I woke up this morning, said I'mma get it 
 Turned right over and I gave that bitch the business 
 Hopped out the king size 
 My friends are green guys 
 Suit on, it look like I done sold bean pies 
 Qui-Qui-Quiet storm 
 I flick my lighter on 
 2 blunts together like an extension cord 
 Oh yeah we gettin' to the money (Understatement) 
 I know you heard my trap bunkin' (Understatement) 
 All my bitches bad (That's a understatement) 
 My car is going really fast (That's a understatement) 
 Oh yeah we gettin' to the money (Understatement) 
 I know you heard my trap bunkin' (Understatement) 
 All my bitches bad (That's a understatement) 
 My car is going really fast (That's a understatement) 
 You need a standing ovation 
 If you stand in my location 
 Every nigga round here done been shot or on probation 
 It's the life we chose, guns and hoes 
 Guns and roses, niggas know that rock don't roll 
 Grab the spray, Drop the phone, Cop the O 
 Niggas know my flow is Mop 'N Glo 
 You know where I be on 
 I be on the styrofoam 
 Chicka-Chi 1, 2 like it was a microphone 
 Your girl's like a drive through, I want a combo 
 And she's so wet I need a towel, pronto 
 2 Chainz, A.K.A. condo 
 Cause that's how much these chains cost if you don't know 
 Oh yeah we gettin' to the money (Understatement) 
 I know you heard my trap bunkin' (Understatement) 
 All my bitches bad (That's a understatement) 
 My car is going really fast (That's a understatement) 
 Oh yeah we gettin' to the money (Understatement) 
 I know you heard my trap bunkin' (Understatement) 
 All my bitches bad (That's a understatement) 
 My car is going really fast (That's a understatement)
