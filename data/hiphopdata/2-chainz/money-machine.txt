I told them, get on my level 
 Bitch, you could get on this shovel 
 Coke prices high, than which was if a Tony Montana 
 I just got me a bezel 
 My slippers is clean 
 All I wear Tru Religion 
 I paid a grip for them jeans 
 I got a lust for the cream 
 I need a money machine 
 I need a money machine 
 I need a money machine 
 I see you doing your thing, but it ain't nothing to me 
 So when you looking at me, I give you something to see 
 I say I'm incredible, most legible 
 Schedule ain't, but I can make your girl flexible, edible 
 Put her top and call it putting her on my pedestal 
 You would never know, unless you worked at the bank 
 Camel toe, look like steak 
 And your boy look like grate 
 2 gun bang 
 And I'm so fly I can sue an airplane 
 You can tell your girl here, because a cab came 
 And I keep it 100, I don't need no spare change 
 Some do it for the fame, some do it for the fortune 
 Fortunately I'm famous, 26's wheel of fortune 
 And I been riding foreign since the fucking introduction 
 I see you doing your thing, it ain't got nothing to me 
 So when you looking at me, I give you something to see 
 I see you doing your thing, it ain't got nothing to me 
 So when you looking at me, I give you something to see 
 I need a money machine 
 I see you doing your thing, it ain't got nothing to me 
 So when you looking at me, I give you something to see 
 Yo it's my time to shine, so I'm checking my Rollie 
 A bet with the Lakers, I bought a necklace off Kobe 
 I be fucking your girl, I was texting her only 
 I told her, "I'd like your legs better if they was open" 
 Ever since the beginning, niggas knew I was focused 
 Strip club tour started Magic, ended at Strokers 
 I'm a fucking example of a fucking example 
 Hit her from the back, nigga, that's a fucking example 
 I came up on Luke Campbell, I'm so sick I need Campbells 
 If you know I'm showing up, I hope you come with your camera 
 Got the city on swole with my Louis bandana 
 My car is shitting on niggas, I should ride with a Pamper 
 I see you doing your thing, it ain't got nothing to me 
 So when you looking at me, I give you something to see 
 I see you doing your thing, it ain't got nothing to me 
 So when you looking at me, I give you something to see 
 I need a money machine 
 I see you doing your thing, it ain't got nothing to me 
 So when you looking at me, I give you something to see 
 I give you something to see when you are looking this way 
 If you approaching with the drama, then we approach with the K 
 And when you look in my eyes all you see is the pain 
 On medication, I can drink 200 a day 
 When you hot in the A, you get a spot in the A 
 It's so big that shit look like a spot in the A 
 These niggas jogging in place and they standing in line 
 Till somebody rhyme bout beating me, then they start dancing in line 
 And if swag was a crime, I'd be doing life plus 30 
 With my ice on early, in all gold knight sterling 
 Try to cook a brick off a George Foreman 
 Take a girl, it'll start spoiling 
 Living room floor look like a nigga going bowling 
 I see you doing your thing, it ain't got nothing to me 
 So when you looking at me, I give you something to see 
 I see you doing your thing, it ain't got nothing to me 
 So when you looking at me, I give you something to see 
 I need a money machine 
 I see you doing your thing, it ain't got nothing to me 
 So when you looking at me, I give you something to see 
 I say it's my time to get it, my time to shine 
 I need a hustling trophy, it's my kind of grind 
 It's my time to get it, my time to shine 
 I need a hustling trophy, it's my kind of grind, bitch
