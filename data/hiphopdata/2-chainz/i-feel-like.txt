Some individuals look at the accomplishments of other individuals and allow themselves to become jealous. Everybody know what it take. Everybody don't do what it take, I don't get tired

 Sometimes you grind from the bottom, get your chips straight 
 Sometimes you can make a million off a mixtape 
 Sometimes you get to the top and then your family hate 
 Don't give a damn what them haters say 
 I feel like I'm 'posed to be ballin' 
 Supposed to be winnin', yeah 
 I feel like I'm 'posed to be ballin' 
 No one gave me shit, yeah 
 I feel like, I feel like I'm 
 (Verse 1: 2 Chainz) 
 I did a song with Kevin way 'fore y'all followed him on his Instagram 
 Did a song with Young Dolph 'fore y'all even know what Memphis had 
 I intend to smash, no pen and pad 
 Married to the game, no strings attached 
 Married to the game, got a season pass 
 You wasn't here, (?) don't even (?) 
 From Decatur to (?), I make love with a mink on 
 I'm top floor, you need a key just to get off of 
 Need a key just to get off of 
 Need a key just to get off of 
 Hanging rappers on a chop board 
 Outline 'em in chalk Lord 
 Thought so 
 Trap nigga on a pop tour 
 Break dancing on cardboard 
 Wrist workin' that Pyrex 
 In the bando with that (?) 
 50 shots with my nigga Jonny 
 Somebody stole the truck from Benihanas 
 Next day he bought a new one 
 Like you win some and you lose some

 (Verse 2: 2 Chainz) 
 I'm supposed to be ballin', 'posed to be winnin' 
 I spent thousands on linens and this is just the beginnin' 
 I bought my momma a crib before I got my own place 
 Picked my pop up from prison and gave 'em places to stay 
 See I am handpicked by God, I defied all the odds 
 I need a sign that say foreigns only in my garage 
 You know I'm vicious and hungry, my competition is phony 
 I'm on my way, kowabunga 
 To all my cousins, I love ya 
 I work hard for this shit, I got sleep deprivation 
 My momma tellin' me, boy you gotta take a vacation 
 I got one in the air, another one in rotation 
 And when they ask me where I'm at, I say the trap my location

 (Verse 3: 2 Chainz) 
 When I dropped Trapaveli, I stayed in 3 star 'telis 
 With 2 time felons, one time I was bailin' 
 Every Tom, Dick, and Helen 
 They would act like they was reppin' 
 Who was real? Who was fake? 
 It was hard to keep it separate 
 And my bankroll big, this big, need (?) 
 And excessive marijuana in my motherfuckin' prison 
 We would wrap it like a present 
 We would act it like the preset 
 You was actin' like a peasant 
 I hold an eagle in the desert 
 With the Rollie and the bezel 
 I was fuckin' with the bastards 
 Yeah I am so slick, bitch you better hit your hazards 
 And I bought a Versace plate just to eat my salad 
 And I can count money till I get a fuckin' callous
