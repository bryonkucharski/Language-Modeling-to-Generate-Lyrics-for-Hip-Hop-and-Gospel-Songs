I treat Goat like he was tata, dealin' up at Popeyes 
 In the fastline, I move him over to the right side 
 Mac-11 life style, burrrt then I hop out 
 Dem burrrt, then it's lights out, I'm spazin' on you right now 
 Mama's only child, the crack house was my daycare 
 Being front to god, grey hair, see that's that old money 
 Kenmore stove money, packs on G rouge money 
 Ridin' down in that foreign whip the color of snow bunny 
 Pull up right to the beach and left the boat runnin' 
 So Sonny, you a comedian, all your flows funny 
 Dope funny, walk through the door, she be like "Oh honey" 
 Plus I got a whip and a lock, they call me 4hunna 
 Tryna come clean off the spot, I'm talkin' detergent 
 Fuck her then answer my phone, I gotta leave urgent 
 Everythin' I did in the past was intellectual 
 Now it's Mr. Gimme-your-section-with-a-extra-booth 
 Show you what the extra do 
 Want a four door, so I bought me an extra coupe 
 One for me, one for me, really ain't no effort to it 
 Mr. Impeccable, turn you to a vegetable, fuck her on the sectional 
 Pull on her hair while she's lickin' on the testicles 
 Sixteen carefully, swag sold separately 
 Aimin' for the stars, so I fucked her on the balcony 
 Laid on the floor and I made your hoe come vacuum me 
 I'm on my Bobby Brown, babe 
 Put it on me tenderoni 
 And I got one of you in every town 
 To put it on me, I'm never lonely 
 Swimmin' in your hits, babe 
 And I'm gone like trip, babe 
 Show out, show out 
 Show out, show out, show out 
 (The-Dream) 
 It's all about you 
 It's all about you (everything we do) 
 It's all about you 
 It's all about you (everything I do) 
 It's all about you 
 (The-Dream & 2 Chainz) 
 Every trapper, ever rapper 
 Everything I do 
 Every baller, ever actor 
 Just wanna impress you 
 Every actor, every actress 
 I just wanna trust you 
 I'm just tryna get you to that mattress 
 You're the finest that money can't buy 
 The finest shit that catches your eye, my 
 Now ball on these bitches 
 Go and ball on these bitches 
 Wanna see you ball on these bitches 
 Baby, ball on these bitches, yeah
