Thank God for the first nigga started drinking 
 Thank God for the first nigga started rapping 
 Thank God for the first girl to start stripping 
 And I'mma have to keep it muhfucking real with 'em 
 I got a problem with these niggas 
 I got a problem with these bitches 
 Trigger finger keep itchin' 
 I pull it, I do it 
 Hang up on a bitch, call it crucified 
 Time to go to work, no suit and tie 
 Bumpin' Makaveli, I be trappin' at the telly 
 My nigga did a dime and he back already 
 Got that sack already, man we got them racks already 
 As far as your girl, I hit it from the back already 
 I tried to get a tan, but I'm black already 
 Your pockets on a diet, my pockets fat already 
 Three niggas with me, me myself and I 
 God don't like ugly, you should testify 
 My T-shirt come from bergdorf 
 I make so much from a verse I take a third off 
 Bird call, swerve off 
 Bust a nut on her, tell her that's a load off 
 Shorty ass soft, like a Nerf ball 
 If you don't like what I'm doing, nigga, fuck y'all 
 Thank God for the first nigga started drinking 
 Thank God for the first nigga started rapping 
 Thank God for the first girl to start stripping 
 And I'mma have to keep it muhfucking real with 'em 
 I got a problem with these niggas 
 I got a problem with these bitches 
 Trigger finger keep itchin' 
 I pull it, I do it 
 Drank in my cup, hope this shit don't spill 
 Pull up in the new edition and that's word to Johnny Gill 
 How I come up with this shit and all these verses that I kill 
 I have no imagination, everything I do for real 
 Bitch I'm camouflage down put your camera phone down 
 If she got an ass and the girl a fan, it's going down 
 I'mma fuck you like I've been waiting a century for it 
 Give the pussy up and I'll trade you the memory for it 
 In the bedroom forever that's what her roommate will tell you 
 Man I just hear this shit and think about what Tunechi will tell you 
 He might call up Patricia, she 'bout to call up Melissa 
 Tell 'em come to the crib and do them both, double dribble 
 I'm colder than a hospital, she love the dick that I give her 
 Hit her from the front, back, side, twist her like cigarillos 
 I put the gun to the pillow, I don't want blood on my clothes 
 Gotta keep that Trukfit fresh, shoutout to all of my hoes 
 Tunechi... 
 That's just how my OG would sum it up 
 I been working all winter just to fuck the summer up 
 It's just me and 2 Chainz, but the chain's never tucked though 
 If you don't like what I'm doing, nigga fuck you 
 Thank God for the first nigga started drinking 
 Thank God for the first nigga started rapping 
 Thank God for the first girl to start stripping 
 And I'mma have to keep it muhfucking real with 'em 
 I got a problem with these niggas 
 I got a problem with these bitches 
 Trigger finger keep itchin' 
 I pull it, I do it 
 Well, if you know like I know that pussy pop like pyro 
 And she know I'm a pothead, that pussy like a pothole 
 I'm colder than the snot nose, man all these hoes is my hoes 
 If she bougie fuck her once then leave her hanging, dry clothes 
 I just built a cemetery, niggas dying to get in 
 Niggas lying, they pretend 
 Don't cross that line its paper thin 
 High as a star, make a wish 
 I'm a shark, I ate the fish 
 I got no heart, I hate that bitch 
 (2 Chainz) 
 You hate that bitch, well I hate that bitch 
 Will jump a nigga like a chessboard 
 Do a drive by while you're riding on your skateboard 
 They ain't even know it 
 Have Drake sing a song just to get her pussy wet 
 Then I take her to the crib 
 Man fuck that bitch right on the step 
 Put it in and take it back out, then I back out 
 Hair weave killer known to snatch the fucking track out 
 Put me in the game coach, I'm the antidote 
 Pull up, kick, throw and take the money and the dope 
 True, 2 Chainz, I'm on a plane and a boat 
 I am so cold I need a cover and a coat 
 Kick it at the mall, call it football 
 If you don't like what I'm doing, nigga, fuck y'all 
 Y'all ready? 1, 2, 3 
 Right now it's me time 
 A little time for myself, me time 
 Oh yeah, right now it's me time 
 Don't want no one else now, me time 
 Bitch please don't call my phone, don't call my phone 
 Said I wanna be left alone, be left alone 
 Please, please don't stop by my home 
 No, no 'cause I feel it's just matter of time 
 Till you people make me lose my mind 
 I'm 'bout to leave this world behind 
 Right now it's me time 
 You need to go kick rocks now 
 Me time
