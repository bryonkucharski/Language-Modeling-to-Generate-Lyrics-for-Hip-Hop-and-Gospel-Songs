What! 
 Yeah 
 Worried 'bout a hater' Not me 
 Turned to the max, no sleep 
 Smoked a hundred joints to the face give a fuck what a bitch nigga say 
 E'rything about me ('bout me) 
 E'rything about me ('bout me) 
 E'rything about me, E'rything about me ('bout me) 
 E'rything about me ('bout me) 
 E'rything about me (what!) 
 Rolling, pockets swollen 
 Riding in it like it's stolen 
 Weeded, hella conceded 
 If it ain't about money, nigga I don't need it 
 Got a hundred grand in my ashtray 
 Spend a hundred K on a bad day 
 And I'm tied up like a cholo nigga act crazy, my dogs go loco 
 Kush got me moving slow mo 
 What my nigga Poblem? That's my bro bro 
 Came in through the backdoor 
 Ten mill this year on the low low 
 And I'm still smoking pre-rolls 
 Krissed out, dumb fucking with the cliko 
 And my bank full of zeros 
 Young Wiz will get fly like a hero 
 Worried 'bout a hater? Not me 
 Turned to the max, no sleep 
 Smoked a hundred joints to the face give a fuck what a bitch nigga say 
 E'rything about me ('bout me) 
 E'rything about me ('bout me) 
 E'rything about me, E'rything about me ('bout me) 
 E'rything about me ('bout me) 
 E'rything about me (what!) 
 Problem 'cause, with them hoe's like a doughnut 
 Sold more weed then ye's ever smoked up 
 Dick make her choke up, like a real no rock 
 But I'm feeling like a mill, off a pill door locked we ain't lettin' all no more bros in 
 But fo' sho' we'll let y'all hoes in 
 'Cause when we pullin' money out they be lovin' it 
 Give her dick 'fore I give a bitch my government (what!?) 
 Just eight, I got eight more 
 Super duper high, eighty-eighth floor 
 Unzip this, that's eight more 
 Fuck a pussy and fuck rhyming 
 We gon' live forever, fuck dying 
 Get it till I drop, fuck tryin' 
 Pedal to the metal, we flyin' 
 In the fast lane, yellin' Diamond! 
 Worried 'bout a hater' Not me

 E'rything about me ('bout me) 
 E'rything about me, E'rything about me ('bout me)

 E'rything about me 
 Young wild nigga, mouth full of gold teeth 
 Treatin' bape.com like a swap meet 
 Going crazy on a bitch until she knock-kneed 
 I'm in a hella fast whip going top speed 
 Make a mess in that pussy and then she mop clean 
 I drop racks and she drops jeans 
 Smoke green as I lean, top dropping 
 Nigga I am all about a buck falling out a truck 
 Prolly with some hoes that I just met and yeah, they all gon' fuck 
 Got her man callin' up her homies, blowin' all 'em up 
 Tryna figure out which his girl is, she probably toasted 
 Like a champagne glass 
 So much money that ain't a damn thing sad 
 Do my damn thing in my campaign add 
 Let's get straight to it, don't let a damn thing pass, nigga what?
