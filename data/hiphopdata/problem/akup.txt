Waste money before I waste my time, 
 Keep a bad bitch on my line 
 Real buzz, let me talk my shit, 
 Quit playing, girl, hop on this dick 
 And akup, akup, akup, akup, akup, akup, 
 Akup, akup, akup, akup, akup, akup 
 Big dog rolling on campus, 
 Bitching, me rolling in the city is my canvas 
 Pull over bad bitches to my right side, 
 Niggers, they be tripping 
 cause I'm fucking with their bitches, shit 
 Didn't even rhyme, but it sound good, 
 She said she wanted dip over, I give her hard wood, 
 West side, baby, get enough call, 
 Didn't bring a bat back, I just knock the doors down 
 Wait, my nigger, what you tripping for? 
 Fuck these hoes, get the door 
 Stack your money, make your shit clip, 
 Don't get caught up in your whip with an ugly bitch 
 All right, train me like Eddy, 
 Fuck this, I'm a pedi, 
 All the bitches crazy, call me Tom Petty 
 Grab her hips, tell her keep that ass steady, 
 With that mouth good, show me, girl, don't tell me 
 Waste money before I waste my time, 
 Keep a bad bitch on my line 
 Real buzz, let me talk my shit, 
 Quit playing, girl, hop on this dick 
 And akup, akup, akup, akup, akup, akup, 
 Akup, akup, akup, akup, akup, akup 
 Tell a broke nigger back up, 
 I'm cashed up, tied up in the game, I'm stuffed up 
 Tuxedo bitches got a lap up, 
 I don't matter when the automorb throw my hat up, akup 
 Walk up, wondering why them bitches don't trust us, 
 Pussy coming in, I'ma need more rubbers, 
 Your bitch love us, she lick dick under covers, 
 Take cover, leave nothing on the tongue, girl 
 I like damn bitches in the valley, 
 Working at them dalleys, porn star Valery, 
 Nice to meet, said she like the D, 
 I like to be in fact like once a week 
 Once she get the akup, bitch, pack up, 
 Turn around, count the money, watch the shit add up 
 Turn around, get another bitch that's badder, 
 Ask fed up and then fuck her faster, nigger 
 Waste money before I waste my time, 
 Keep a bad bitch on my line 
 Real buzz, let me talk my shit, 
 Quit playing, girl, hop on this dick 
 And akup, akup, akup, akup, akup, akup, 
 Akup, akup, akup, akup, akup, akup 
 Bad bitches on my line, call it car waiting 
 Niggers waiting on a sideline, they be hating 
 Four bitches on my whip, I'm a limit dating 
 All black karma, ask me of a nigger's hating 
 And I run myself like a really, 
 When a nigger play my songs, hand a bottle to the DJ 
 I rather kill her, I rather fuck your bitch, nigger, 
 You're at home, I'm on the road, getting rich, nigger 
 Enough of that shit, let me get back to the women, 
 Cause it's taking this bitch, I'm liking what I see 
 Give me more bottles, I'm trying to get drunk, 
 Wake up tomorrow, look to my right, ask who the fuck is you? 
 Please don't tell me what we do, 
 Poundry, round two, high class biz', 
 But best believe I'll ground you 
 Walk of shame, baby, let my homies crown you 
 Waste money before I waste my time, 
 Keep a bad bitch on my line 
 Real buzz, let me talk my shit, 
 Quit playing, girl, hop on this dick 
 And akup, akup, akup, akup, akup, akup, 
 Akup, akup, akup, akup, akup, akup
