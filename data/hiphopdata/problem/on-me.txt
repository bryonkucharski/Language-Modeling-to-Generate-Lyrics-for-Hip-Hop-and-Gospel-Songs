Rollin', pockets on Bruce Bruce by Louken 
 Coming from colors like fruit loops remove goose 
 Hoes right behind me in 2 groups they too loose 
 Balling on me running through niggas bitches that shoot hoops cruise 
 '93 magic blue on Shaq feet 
 Back like the bitch ran track ass like athletes 
 Tight up in them jeans so please swing that pass me 
 Finally got that ass bitch, striptease me last week 
 I guess I got the dick so I make the rules 
 When they let the mothernigga play the rules 
 Strapped up motherfucker better play cool 
 FNH 5.7, that's my favorite tool 
 I'm a fool dog ass nigga 
 So go play with your kids I'm a grown ass nigga bitch 
 I'm a fool dog ass nigga 
 So go play with your kids I'm a grown ass nigga bitch 
 It's all on me I put it on me 
 Until the day I die fuck hoes smoke tree 
 We bustin' up the yak you and rollin' OG 
 Got bottles under table the tab they 4G 
 And I put it on me, me, me 
 I put it on me, me, me 
 Said It's all on me, me, me 
 I put it on me, me, me 
 Said I put it on me 
 Compton California that's where I'm from 
 Fuck your girl pussy until it's numb 
 Do my damn thing and I shake like I'm pimpin' 
 Favorite state hate long as real niggas recognize 
 I'm good, yeah yeah I'm good 
 Taking care of my day ones and feeding on my wolf 
 2 365's ago I was live you know 
 Yeah I got off more tree than woods 
 Nigga it's the real, ace of spades a deal 
 It ain't what you say it's how you say what you feel 
 I do it from the chest I reek of success 
 You ain't seen a nigga this cold out the West in a long time 
 Boy say you wanna problem it's a long line 
 Super hot boy push a cold line 
 Shawty starring at a gold mine 
 I'm on now, showtime 
 It's all on me I put it on me 
 Until the day I die fuck hoes smoke tree 
 We bustin' up the yak you and rollin' OG 
 Got bottles under table the tab they 4G 
 And I put it on me, me, me 
 I put it on me, me, me 
 Said It's all on me, me, me 
 I put it on me, me, me 
 Said I put it on me 
 We smoking OG 
 I meet up with my nigga 
 We chopping the whole key 
 I slap it on a fire he slap it on a G 
 But yo that's still my folks be close since '93 
 Money over bitches running with my niggas 
 Hooting with the squad the robbers and dope dealers 
 Without these permissions I'm German the cold killers 
 Open on the streets don't got mercy on broke niggas 
 I'm thugging to the east bay and my nigga jack of 7 
 I'm on the freeway I need another pack of that 
 You know how beef lay hit a lick flip the zippers 
 I told the girl I'm just the type of nigga 
 Got my killer from the east bay 
 Hit the lay I got some weight to the 8th tray 
 You broke it down I hit my money at the next day 
 Hit a liquor flip the zippers 
 Told my girl I'm just the type of nigga 
 It's all on me I put it on me 
 Until the day I die fuck hoes smoke tree 
 We bustin' up the yak you and rollin' OG 
 Got bottles under table the tab they 4G 
 And I put it on me, me, me 
 I put it on me, me, me 
 Said It's all on me, me, me 
 I put it on me, me, me 
 Said I put it on me
