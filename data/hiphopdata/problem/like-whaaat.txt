Who dat, talking bout, who dat 
 Run up on me, you get your ass beat blue black 
 Go on get nerve, I'm off the curb 
 Push mountains of herb, you niggas already heard 
 The bro Berg, keep a pistol gripped pump on his lap at all time 
 Whatever however, cause young niggas stay trying 
 See them and be like huh, nigga, what? 
 Huh, give a fuck like whaaat 
 Blow my weed, smash the gas 
 Then hop up in my lane, she be looking way different 
 Through these thousand dollars frames 
 Millionaire mind, fuck the thousand dollars brain 
 Thousand dollar lame only get loud around his gang ass nigga, 
 Ass nigga, Compton for real, you ain't gotta ask nigga 
 Floating through the city like I'm on a raft nigga 
 Mike Vick with the shit, I don't need a pass nigga

 Banging my gang like ooh

 Huh, nigga what, huh, give a fuck, nigga whaaat (That nigga be like)

 The bitch hit me up then I'm probably going down 
 It depends on how much of that shit I just had 
 Pill cool but I prefer my MDMA by the bag 
 Heavy hitter right here, all you other nigga's jabs 
 Big talking bout beef till you serve they ass a slab 
 Do the math hoes clash, 'cause I got them yelling, "Woo!" like Flair 
 When I'm done they always ask, "How you do dat there!?" 
 Hol' up, word to Master P and Young Bleed 
 I pull your bitch she trying kick it fast as Chun Li 
 'Cause I'm a pimp see, word to Bun B 
 Underground king, no checker, shout out to the bitch pressing 
 Get a weight lifters, reppin' Cal like Ripken I'm on fire right now 
 P burnin', no Syphilis, 
 Strap it up, you murder the pussy 
 Real beef you don't talk, you just murder the pussy, see me? 
 Yeah I'm just doing my thang, fingers in the sky 
 Banging my gang like ooh 
 Goon fall back, cause you don't want no problems like that 
 'Cause we gonna be like, 
 Huh, nigga what, huh, give a fuck, nigga whaaat (That nigga be like) 
 Huh, nigga what, huh, give a fuck, nigga whaaat (That nigga be like) 
 Who dat, I bet your lady knew that 
 She said he got a ticket on the molly, mommy do that 
 Talking with my round diamond lean I thought you knew that 
 Down ass Raider hunned sixes is where we grew that 
 See me on the 10 with my squad we so trill 
 Or uptown with them foolies niggas, trapping by the mill 
 I do it for my bros on lock, them hoes on stock 
 I used to wear Pirellis back when Nelly was on top 
 Now it's 442 my pack a bang rewinding, 
 My bitches red as highness throw back on them Yokohamas 
 I'ma slam the scraper, you touch the paper it's go, 
 We out here grindin' fo sho 
 These hoes thinking it's snow 
 I get it goin' my nig', I blow the horn as she ready 
 Disrespectful nigga please, I'm the one with the fetty 
 I'm going out with a bang, it's lane on the chain 
 I just show 'em my diamonds nigga 'cause Lane is the game.
