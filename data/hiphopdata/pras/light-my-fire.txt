Yo 
 (uh, what, yo, uh-huh) 
 ha, yeah yeah 
 Yeah, eh-heh, all right 
 (mmm, uh, uh) 
 Good morning light my fire baby woo, woo, woo 
 Oh, girl you make me feel fine 
 (yeah, uh, ha ha) 
 Dan-na-dah-doo-doo-dah.oh 
 Dan-na-dah-doo-doo-dah 
 Well I was born a mixed breed, a planted seed 
 Mixed with some weed and a little bit of Hennessy 
 When I bleed, I love to believe 
 That a friend in need is a friend indeed 
 Where da bumba claat, where da bumba ras 
 Forget me not, dem know a Super Pras 
 Blueberry don't start no fight 
 Sean Paul tell 'em pass the light 
 Eighty bars but your 16 ain't worth the spit 
 Money, cars and fame is that all you get? 
 Pride and respect in the street, that's not all I got 
 Silly boy come test, cause dem wield de shot 
 Seckle de violence, bad boy move in silence 
 Give them some guidance, they need to see the science 
 (Fire that's richer than ??) 
 Well speak up 
 And through your minutes of fame I kept my feet up 
 C'mon and light my fire, baby, whoa 
 Kiss the sun let's get higher, high 
 They don't think we're gonna make it, oh 
 Fuck the world let's just take it, high 
 Well I was often told I was off my road 
 Never sold my soul for the glitter of gold 
 Let the truth be told, I made the mold 
 23 years old, 20 million sold 
 Y'all dream of half-a-mill, lookin' for your next meal 
 Ask the guerillas, I signed my own deal 
 Movies, clothing, ma I'm so ill 
 Mash up the dance floor 
 (yo Pras chill) 
 Man seckle, I'm bumpin like a kettle 
 You don't hear the sound bustin' your vessel? 
 {brrap} 
 And for my enemies, scope 'em like the Kennedy's 
 You think I'm lyin'? Go and ask the ReFugees 
 C'mon and light my fire, baby, whoa 
 Kiss the sun let's get higher, high 
 They don't think we're gonna make it, oh 
 Fuck the world let's just take it, high 
 Forty days forty nights I was off the scene 
 Cocked back my style with a gangsta lean 
 Kept my ears to the streets and my hands been clean 
 Servin' rice and beans while I plot and scheme 
 Back by the A-Team, we buffalo soldiers 
 Rude bwoy run 'way, I thought I told ya 
 Guns too big to fight in a holster 
 Still stay true to my roots and culture 
 When we comin', rushin' in best be afraid 
 We take a flag when we march in our parade 
 Brooklyn, Trini, Jamaican, Haitian 
 We built to rule like United Nation 
 Still Pras fat hooks I'm no Nas 
 Tight bars through wars ain't no scars 
 Took the pilgramage to conquer Rome 
 Dethroned Caesar, guerillas now they're home, baby 
 C'mon and light my fire, baby, whoa 
 Kiss the sun let's get higher, high 
 They don't think we're gonna make it, oh 
 Fuck the world let's just take it, high 
 (Light up, light up) 
 Yeah, guerillas baby, you don't see us comin' 
 (Light up, light up) 
 Brrap, brrap, lights out, ah-heh-heh
