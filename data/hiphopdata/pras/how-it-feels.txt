When I grow up, I'ma be a superstar 
 Ah-ha, alright baby 
 (They don't know how it feels) 
 When you're out on your own, yeah 
 And you're lookin' for that home 
 (They don't know what it is) 
 When the world's on your shoulder 
 And your baby gotta be a soldier 
 Yo I was born in the projects with roaches and rats 
 And our credentials were our nines and gats 
 Stay the hell out the hood, read the welcomin' mats 
 I remember them days, it was hard bein' black 
 Welfare checks and government cheese 
 Take your family portrait, everybody smile, say 
 "Cheese" 
 And it's a wonder how I kept my head from goin' under 
 Sun don't shine where there's lightning and thunder 
 Some got ways, some got means 
 But still, we all just got hopes and dreams 
 The two blend together like dope and fiends 
 Cope with teens has that new gangster lean 
 Everybody just wanna be a ghetto star 
 Fly cribs and drivin' them big cars 
 That's all Mr. President, hear the voice of the youth 
 I don't lie, I speak the truth 
 (They don't know how it feels) 
 When you a single mother 
 And don't have that significant other 
 (They don't know what it is) 
 To be in the ghetto 
 And your life be in slow mo', uh yeah 
 Been around the world a couple times with the ReFugees 
 From the boot of Italy to the land of Pawnee 
 Fell in love a couple times on the London Bridge 
 Fast cars, fast life, that's how I wanted to live 
 What a crusade, one of my great escapades 
 Cut many hearts, like the game of spades 
 But nothin' was as fatal when they blew the World Trade 
 Now we at war mama, tradin' lives for grenades 
 Send in the troops, here comes the brigades 
 American resolve and our hearts'll never fade 
 I know you somewhere out there chillin' in the shades 
 But I hate to be the one to rain on your parade 
 See God is merciful and God bless his children 
 That's how we gonna reconstruct them buildings 
 So stop the killings, we runnin' out of graves 
 In the land of the free and the home of the brave 
 (They don't know how it feels) 
 To hear our babies cry 
 And watch our mothers die 
 (They don't know how it feels) 
 To see our brothers in prison 
 While they losin' their religion 
 These eyes of mines are like camera lens 
 Loved by many but stabbed by my friends 
 Is this the end? Some may cry out loud 
 But I won't worry we gonna, make it now 
 The ghetto fed up but they won't break us down 
 It's an eye for an eye what goes around comes around 
 Do this for my peeps who couldn't speak 
 Survival of the fittest, what happens to the weak? 
 They either in between, above or beneath 
 Tryin' to play me like a scrub in a passenger seat 
 Racial profile to say the least 
 (okay) 
 There won't be no peace in the belly of the beast, c'mon 
 But we gonna make it through, baby 
 Even though the world is so crazy 
 And if they ask you, tell 'em it's pain times three 
 'Cause it's a million of them kids stressin' just like me, baby 
 (They don't know how it feels) 
 To see us go to war 
 And see the people free for no more 
 (They don't know how it feels) 
 To be a black man in America 
 And feel like they're comin' to get'cha 
 (They don't know how it feels) 
 To work for minimum wage 
 As your life starts to fade 
 (They don't know how it feels) 
 To be down to your last buck 
 And no one really gives a mother, huh
