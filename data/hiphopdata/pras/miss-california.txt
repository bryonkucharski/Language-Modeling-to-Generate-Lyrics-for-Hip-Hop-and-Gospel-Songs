She's a rich girl from the top of the food chain 
 Love and material things, kinda lonely 
 Till I met her at the Grammys, 10mil on a diamond ring 
 She invites me to spend a day on the jet skies 
 At first it didn't mean a thing 
 Then she told me I'm the one that she searched for 
 It was hard to believe. 
 She's miss California, hottest thing in west L.A. 
 House down by the water, sails her yacht across the bay 
 Drives a maranello, Hollywood's her favorite scene 
 Loves to be surrounded with superstars that know her name. 
 In a couple a days she had me a bracelet 
 Made, from Harry Winstons place 
 Went horseback up to the mountain top 
 Shown me the land she's got, 
 Well its all right but something else is on your mind, 
 Looking past all that shines now the tears are running through 
 All those things are nice but it's not why I'm here 
 I will wipe away your tears simply by just loving you.
