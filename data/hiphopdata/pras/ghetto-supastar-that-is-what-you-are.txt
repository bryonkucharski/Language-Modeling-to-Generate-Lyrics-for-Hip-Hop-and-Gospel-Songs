Man, man look up at the sky 
 All the stars man the stars is beautiful tonight 
 Look at 'em 
 Ghetto superstar, that is what you are 
 Comin' from afar reachin' for the stars 
 Run away with me to another place 
 We can rely on each other, uh, uh 
 From one corner to another, uh, uh 
 Uh yeah, yo, yo, 
 Some got, hopes and dreams, we got, ways and means 
 The supreme dream team, always up with the schemes 
 From hubcaps to sellin' raps, name your theme 
 My rise to the top, floatin' on this cream 
 Who the hell wanna stop me, I hated those who doubt me 
 A million refugees with unlimited warranties 
 Black Caesar, dating top squeezers 
 Diplomatic legalese, no time for a Visa 
 They just begun, I'ma shoot them one by one 
 Got five sides to me, somethin' like a pentagon 
 Strike with the forces of King Solomon 
 Lettin' bygones be bygones and so on and so on 
 I'ma teach this cat, how to live in the ghetto 
 Keepin' it retrospective from the get go 
 Lay low, let my mind shine like a halo 
 Politic with ghetto senators on the deelow 
 Ghetto superstar, that is what you are 
 Comin' from afar reachin' for the stars 
 Run away with me to another place 
 We can rely on each other, uh, uh 
 From one corner to another, uh, uh 
 One, two and you don't stop, yo my eyes is sore, bein' a senator 
 Behind closed doors hittin' truth to the sea floor 
 The rich go North ignore, the tug of war 
 While the kids are poor, open new and better drug stores 
 So I became hardcore, couldn't take it no more 
 I'ma reveal everything, change the law 
 I find myself, walkin' the streets 
 Tryin' to find what's really goin' on in the streets 
 Yeah, yo, yo, yo 
 Now every dog got his day, needless to say 
 When the chief away that's when them cats want to play 
 I told you, mess around you fools like Cassius Clay 
 Stretch my heater make you do a pas de bourree 
 Kick your balls like Pele, pick 'em doin' ballet 
 Peak like Dante, broader than Broadway 
 Get applause like a matador, cry yellin', ole 
 Who the hell wanna save me, from B.K., to Cali, come on 
 Ghetto superstar, that is what you are 
 Comin' from afar reachin' for the stars 
 Run away with me to another place 
 We can rely on each other, uh, uh 
 From one corner to another, uh, uh 
 Yeah, yo, yeah 
 Just when you thought it was safe in a common place 
 Showcase your finest is losin fast in the horse race 
 Two faced, gettin' defaced, out like Scarface 
 Throw your roll money, let me put on my screw face 
 Well, I'm paranoid at the things I said 
 Wonderin' what's the penalty from day to day, I'm hangin' out 
 Partyin' with girls that never die, you see I was 
 Pickin' on the small fries, my campaign tellin' lies 
 Was just spreadin' my love, didn't know my love 
 Was the one holdin' the gun and the glove 
 But it's all good as long as it's understand 
 It's all together now, in the hood 
 Ghetto superstar, that is what you are 
 Comin' from afar reachin' for the stars 
 Run away with me to another place 
 We can rely on each other, uh, uh 
 From one corner to another, uh, uh 
 Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh 
 Yeah, all stars, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Ghetto superstar, that is what you are 
 Comin' from afar reachin' for the stars 
 Run away with me to another place 
 We can rely on each other, uh, uh 
 From one corner to another, uh, uh 
 Sing it baby, sing it baby 
 To another, ah, ha, ha, ha 
 Yeah, hay, ah
