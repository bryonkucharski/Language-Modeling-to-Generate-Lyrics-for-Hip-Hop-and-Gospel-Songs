(Ky-Mani) 
 Oh no, oh no 
 Say, we gonna rock down through electric avenue 
 And then we'll take it higher (higher) 
 Say, we gonna rock down through the brooklyn avenues 
 And then we'll take it higher (higher) 
 Oh no, oh no 
 (Pras) 
 Yeah, yo, slick like Rick James when I hit 
 Superfreak chicks, I don't miss (Yo I don't miss) 
 Mix wit yo nose, my flows make you sick 
 Two chicks for me, none for you like Twix 
 Play with niggaz head like Clef's guitar picks 
 Went from bottom pits to makin' hits and 
 Hollow tips and shootin lips (right) 
 Handle our business, make sure it sits 
 Ride throught the tunnels, fuck the guest lists 
 Light up your block with roman candlesticks 
 Known to blow shows with pyrotechnics 
 Rappin' bout yo' whips while you cats in transits 
 Buyin shorty gifts with checks from wick 
 Your record sound like a demo that was not yet mixed (shit ain't even mixed yet) 
 Your whole style's broke and it should be fixed 
 Time's runnin' out as my Rolex ticks 
 Don't get caught on the ave, it's too electric 
 (Ky-Mani) 
 Oh no, oh no 
 Say, we gonna rock down through electric avenue 
 And then we'll take it higher (higher) 
 Say, we gonna rock down through the brooklyn avenues 
 And then we'll take it higher (higher) 
 Oh no, oh no 
 (Pras) 
 I dedicate this to my peeps who roam the streets 
 God bless they souls, may they rest in peace 
 There are those who finance and those who choose to lease 
 Whatever suits you better on the terms of your lease 
 Different strokes for different folks God 
 I refuse to going back to being broke Lord 
 He got struck wit lightnin, he got hit hard 
 Faces 20 to life maximum, his whole life is scarred 
 The preacher's son and I came off the Santa Maria 
 Ten cases of malt I caught the diarrhea 
 Load the ReFugees on the aircraft carrier 
 Some say Dirty Cash, we never heard of ya 
 (You don't know me? You don't know me?) 
 (Ky-Mani) 
 Oh no, oh no 
 Say, we gonna rock down through electric avenue 
 And then we'll take it higher (higher) 
 Say, we gonna rock down through the brooklyn avenues 
 And then we'll take it higher (higher) 
 Oh no, oh no 
 (Pras) 
 (All right, all right) 
 Watch yo back, watch yo side, swimmin wit sharks 
 String you like a harp while they playin' Mozart 
 No credentials, get nowhere like ozlo 
 Sent back to frisco, at the regal begal 
 Suave like Rico, on fire like pyro 
 Frantic like skitzo, rougher than Brillo 
 He caught the wrap like Donnie Brascoe 
 (Ky-Mani) 
 Out in the streets there is violence 
 Down in Brooklyn there is violence 
 Down there in Queens there is violence 
 And there's a lot of work to be done (Lord) 
 Down in the ghetto there's violence 
 Out in L.A. there is violence 
 In Miami there is violence 
 And there's a lot of work to be done (Lord) 
 Say, we gonna rock down through refugee avenue 
 And then we'll take it higher (higher) 
 Say, we gonna rock down through haiti avenue 
 And then we'll take it higher (higher) 
 (Refugee all stars, yeah, yeah)
