(Diddy) 
 Yeah ye ye yeah yeah 
 Sting 
 Bad Boy remix, come on 
 (Pras) 
 Yo yo yo 
 Hey yo shake what ya mama gave you is her motto 
 Pour out the bottle blow out the candle 
 Too broke to hold too shallow to handle 
 Get all today you never promised tomorrow, yeah 
 Her moves remind me of kung fu flicks 
 Thick lips that contradicts rules of the game 
 She plays the politics 
 Red light special red light district 
 Put on ya make up body all made up 
 Platinum played up Pearl Jam cut up 
 Roxanne Roxanne you don't really have to 
 Put on ya red dress if you feeling kind of blue 
 She got the hots for the disco jocks 
 Rock ya socks at the pop of the tops 
 Never get cool like to call it Glock 
 Twisted minded like Bob Zealot 
 Roxanne 
 (Roxanne Roxanne) 
 (Sting) 
 You don't have to put on the red light (ye ye ye yeah yeah) 
 Those days are over 
 You don't have to sell your body to the night (c'mon) (Roxanne Roxanne) 
 Roxanne Roxanne 
 Roxanne 
 You don't have to wear that dress tonight (remix) 
 Walk the streets for money 
 You don't care if it's wrong or if it's right (ye ye yeah) 
 Roxanne you don't have to put on the red light (Roxanne Roxanne) (x's 2) 
 Put on the red light (Roxanne Roxanne) (x's 5) 
 (Refugee Camp, Bad Boy let's go) 
 Oh! 
 (Pras) 
 Yo what's the haps girl, dancing for the green paperback 
 Sitting at the bar drinking up Cognac 
 She steps in the room, don't know how to act 
 Sweet in emergence, similar to Similac 
 It was the hat 
 Cats wanna be around her shine 
 She wants to party, have a good time 
 She feels kind of hot me feelin' feelin' fine 
 Diggin' all her life just to get a gold mine 
 Bro making the streets she's the pimper's paradise 
 Jewels around her neck getting strong with the ice 
 She said I heard of ya crew I'm your number one fan 
 Love the Refugees down from the islands 
 Driving the Bentleys with her pretty pretty friends 
 Sippin' colada every day is a weekend 
 Heard your name was Pras outta Brooklyn 
 And fifteen million place with your total sound scan 
 (Sting and Diddy) 
 I loved you since I knew you (I like this part, Roxanne Roxanne) 
 I wouldn't talk down to you 
 I have you to tell just how I feel (Roxanne Roxanne) 
 I won't share you with another boy (Ye ye ye yeah yeah) 
 I know my mind is made up (Roxanne Roxanne) 
 So put away your makeup (Roxanne Roxanne) 
 Told you once I won't tell you again 
 It's a bad way (Ye ye yeah, yeah) 
 Roxanne 
 You don't have to put on the red light 
 Roxanne 
 You don't have to put on the red light (x2) 
 Roxanne Roxanne I wanna be your man 
 Put on the red light 
 Roxanne Roxanne I wanna be your man 
 Put on the red light 
 Roxanne Roxanne I wanna be your man 
 Put on the red light
