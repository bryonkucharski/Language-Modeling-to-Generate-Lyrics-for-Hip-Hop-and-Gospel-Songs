(Freddy Mercury) 
 Are you ready?! Hey! 
 Are you ready for this?! 
 Are you hangin' on the edge of your seat?! 
 (Wyclef) 
 I need a break beat! 
 (Freddy Mercury) 
 Are you ready?! Hey! 
 Are you ready for this?! 
 Are you hangin' on the edge of your seat?! 
 (Wyclef) 
 I need a break beat! 
 (Freddy Mercury) 
 Are you ready?! Hey!

 Outta the doorway, the bullets rip! 
 Repeat to the sound of the beat! HEY! 
 [Wyclef] (Freddy Mercury in parentheses) - Chorus 
 Yo... a-for the kids in the club that's ready to get bugged! 
 (Another One Bites the Dust!) 
 A-for the thugs with the burners, that wanna blast off! 
 (Another One Bites the Dust!) 
 And for the kids on the blocks, shootin' at the crooked cops, BLAOW! 
 (Another One Bites the Dust!) 
 (And another one down, and another one down 
 Another One Bites the Dust, Hey!) 
 Wyclef, Dirty Cash, Young Free... Freddy, where you at? 
 (Steve walks warily down the street with the brim pulled way down low) 
 Some cat up in Brooklyn just got robbed with a Kangol! 
 (*In tune with F. Mercury*) 
 (Are you ready?! Hey! 
 Are you ready for this?! 
 Are you hangin' on the edge of your seat?! 
 Out of the doorway, the bullets rip! 
 Repeat to the sound of the beat! HEY! 
 My man got shot, and the block got hot! 
 (Another One Bites the Dust!) 
 Yo, hey yo I hear more shots, it's like Fort Knox kid! 
 (Another One Bites the Dust!) 
 Yo, Hold your breath... Hold your breath... Hold your breath... Yo, CHECK IT! 
 (And another one down, and another down, Another One Bites The Dust!) 
 (Wyclef - Verse One) 
 If you're a soldier at ease 
 My military style is known to murder Nazi's, Brooklyn to Germany (Come on) 
 My kamikaze will blow the U2, they hire Idi Amin in Timbuktu 
 Whether you indo, or do the Voodoo 
 You can't foresee this unless I bring the previews, HEY! HEY! 
 Yo, it's the number one rappin' band! (Come on, come on) 
 Yo... This review, will be critically acclaimed 
 Leave you in critical pain, clinically insane 
 The name Wyclef Jean, with a yes, yes y'all! 
 Better have a vest y'all! I'll blast, and bless y'all! 
 "F"- y'all, the mark of the beast, the triple six 
 Time running out, listen to the tick! 
 If you see what I saw, then you seen what I seen, If you know what I know, 
 You know what I mean! 
 Commanding officer of the Navy SEAL team 
 Once I give the orders, you feel the infrared beam... BLAOW! 
 (Wyclef - Chorus) 
 For all you critics, sayin' "another remake!" 
 (Another One Bites the Dust!) 
 Yo, if you know the deal, this is the master reel, kid! Ha Ha! 
 (Another One Bites the Dust!) 
 Right! Right! Freddy Mercury, where you at yo?! 
 (And another one down, and another one down, Another One Bites the Dust!) 
 (How do you think I'm gonna get along, 
 Without you when you're gone!) 
 I need a break beat! 
 Yo if you're ready for the first of the month, 
 For that welfare check, come on! 
 (KICKED ME OUT ON MY OWN!) I need a break beat! 
 (Are you happy?! are you satisfied?! 
 HOW LONG CAN YOU STAND THE HEAT!??) I need a break beat! 
 (Outta the doorway, the bullets rippa! 
 To the sound of the beat!) 
 Yo! Bulletproof vests, like the wild wild west 
 (Another One Bites the Dust!) 
 Yo! This is a stickup, now take off your Rolex! 
 (Another One Bites the Dust!) 
 Yo! Dirty money, good money, yo it's all money-money! 
 (Another One Bites the Dust!) 
 Yo! Dirty Cash! Dirty Cash! The adventures of Dirty Cash! 
 (And another one down, and another one down, Another One Bites the Dust!) 
 (Prakazrel "Pras") 
 Yo, for the love for the cash I'll blast you in my path! 
 Keep my eyes on the math, you cats don't know the half! 
 As far as I'm concerned, you cats can burn in flames 
 This ain't no game! I'm-a start callin' names! 
 So come get me, if you know the one-fifty 
 A million Refugees ready to bust wit' me! 
 Bloody, filthy, in this rap shhh---! 
 You gonna have to kill me, since you can't beat me! 
 Pras! Dirty! Cash! You're the greedy! 
 Believe me! God'll let me fly, like R. Kelly! 
 Bite another dust with my man Freddy Mercury! 
 What height nineties got ya cash, wannabe CRAZY! 
 (Free) 
 Practically, I tactically destroy 
 Deploy more decoys than a presidential convoy 
 My whole envoy stay camouflaged out 
 And when I walk the street, I take the Refugee route 
 This one go out to all my thugs in the borough 
 So just stay thorough, like Kilamanjaro 
 Split it with an arrow, my girl platoon roll 
 Outta control, the female mandingos! 
 Free! I evolve from the egg of a seminarian 
 Don't go down, 'cause I'm a vegetarian! 
 And when I bust, it ain't in God we trust 
 And if you bring a gun, you better bring a black tusk! 
 (Wyclef - Chorus) 
 She looked into my eyes and said F-B-I! 
 (Another One Bites the Dust!) 
 She said she loved me, she was a spy who lied! 
 (Another One Bites the Dust!) Right! 
 I could relate... could you relate? 
 (Another One Bites the Dust!) 
 Jerry "Wonder", The Product (Male singer from The Product, keys a vocal note) 
 {Don't you know we coming for yo?!} 
 Yo, Canibus, John Forte', (Another One Bites the Dust!) 
 Yo, Dirty Cash, and baby Free! (Another One Bites the Dust!) 
 Wyclef Jean, Freddy Mercury! Ha-ha! I'm out baby! 
 (And another one down, and another one down, another one bites the dust!)
