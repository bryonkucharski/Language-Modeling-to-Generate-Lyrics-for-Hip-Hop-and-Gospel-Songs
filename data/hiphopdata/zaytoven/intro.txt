 Zaytoven 
 Funky Fingers 
 The man of many aliases 
 My partner 
 Zay, this right here's a moment 
 This a story 
 The greatest producer ever 
 Huh 
 I could go on talking all day about my partner Zay 
 The one man live band, my right hand man 
 Mr. So Icy 
 We icier than ever 
 It's magnificent 
 It's beautiful 
 The music, it's gorgeous 
 Zaytoven, made the soundtrack to damn near my whole life 
 So I just want y'all to sit back and relax 
 Matter fact, scratch that 
 Stand up, lean forward 
 Open your eyes, open your ears 
 Empty your pocket books 
 If you think I'm saying something stupid, watch your mouth 
 Zay, your fingers are blessed 
 I'm honored to do this intro 
 If it wasn't for Zay there wouldn't be no Gucci Mane 
 Not Gucci Mane the rapper 
 Probably Gucci Mane the robber 
 It all started in Zay's momma's basement 
 It's Gucci 
 Ziggy!
