You're turning off your course again 
 That fall would kill a stronger man 
 With hungry headlights closing in 
 St John is looking welcoming 
 Death is always closer than 
 Death is closer than all your friends 
 Death is closer than we think 
 He's closer than your friends and things 
 We drove that car into a full-on spin 
 I wonder just how it would feel if we dove on in 
 I caught a glimpse of my screaming friend 
 But when the sound cut out, I swore she's laughing 
 Shattered lights spiral and blur on in 
 And then rain sang along to her freckled skin 
 This city's just a smudge on watery lens 
 I couldn't help but feel helpless, so I kissed her again. 
 Turn it off and walk away 
 Don't look down into those waves 
 You'll never be the same again 
 And we all suffer short term memory loss 
 From time to time 
 You got him jumping everywhere 
 Across the gaps and stairs 
 Embracing every nick and cut 
 And jammed finger face plant it's 
 He doesn't care for good repair 
 Soak up the sun and air 
 And Chipped a tooth to feel the truth 
 Breaking every bone he can't mend. 
 The blood's the thing that drives the dream 
 That makes him think he can fall off. 
 The blood's the thing that boils to steam 
 That makes machines out of our hearts. 
 The tires breathing out 
 Like tired moms and troubled teens. 
 With secret smoke breaks 
 Balancing between showmanship and discovery. 
 Mister melodrama is over there covering things 
 Directing traffic, mumbling, like "move it along, nothing to see" 
 It's such a funny dream 
 Its such a sight to see 
 Honking horns and doubled breeze, 
 Matthews bridge in a watercolor dream 
 And I'm just standing there shifting in my skin 
 Sifting grate below, 
 Fall to the rivers wash, taste my blood 
 Embrace my breaking bones 
 Turn it off and walk away 
 Don't look down into those waves 
 You'll never be the same again 
 And we all suffer short term memory loss 
 From time to time 
 We all suffer short term memory loss 
 From time to time x4
