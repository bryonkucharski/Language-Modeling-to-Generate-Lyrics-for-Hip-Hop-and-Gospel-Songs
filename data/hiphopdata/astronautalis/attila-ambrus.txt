Girl, I'll make a mink stole from the Spanish moss 
 And drag a shot of whiskey up from the river bottom 
 We ain't got to swallow our pride 
 We ain't got to swallow our pride 
 Gimme a long kiss goodbye, hold your heart 
 And be sure to tell 'em all just why I shot him 
 Don't ever let 'em catch you crying 
 Don't ever let 'em catch you crying 
 Come on, lady, I been waiting patient pacing playing the wall 
 For maybe half of the night 
 You been playing hard to get, you taste your fingertips 
 You dip into the glass and spin the ice 
 The heat is on the kettle now, we'll never settle down 
 And darlin' I ain't asking for life 
 Let's blow some steam and spin across the planks and beams 
 I wanna dance and shake the rafters and lights 
 Old John Law's gonna drag our asses through the street 
 And when he slaps them cuffs on my hands 
 I want blisters, blisters on my feet 
 Blisters on my feet 
 Blisters on my feet 
 Blisters on my feet 
 (And bring that chorus back for me) 
 Girl, I'll make a mink stole from the Spanish moss 
 And drag a shot of whiskey up from the river bottom 
 We ain't got to swallow our pride 
 We ain't got to swallow our pride 
 Gimme a long kiss goodbye, hold your heart 
 And be sure and tell 'em all just why I shot him 
 Don't ever let 'em catch you crying 
 Don't ever let 'em catch you crying 
 I ain't never seen a man who could make sense 
 Of what the good Lord is asking us right 
 I wasn't born to kill, but baby 
 That's this morning's pill 
 That we don't have to swallow tonight 
 All our friends had bitter ends 
 With broken bottle hands and cigarettes for lashes on eyes 
 So let's collapse on boulevards of bottle caps 
 And sing a song for all the crap in our lives 
 I know we got blues beating down our door 
 But we got a time till sunrise so flip that deadbolt 
 And get back out on the floor 
 Old John Law's gonna drag our asses through the street 
 And when he slaps them cuffs on my hands 
 I want blisters, blisters on my feet 
 Blisters on my feet 
 Blisters on my feet 
 Blisters on my feet 
 (And bring that chorus back for me) 
 Girl, I'll make a mink stole from the Spanish moss 
 And drag a shot of whiskey up from the river bottom 
 We ain't got to swallow our pride 
 We ain't got to swallow our pride 
 Gimme a long kiss goodbye, hold your heart 
 And be sure to tell 'em all just why I shot him 
 Don't ever let 'em catch you crying 
 Don't ever let 'em catch you crying
