Pretty Patricia was a nervous wreck 
 Deadened by the Darvocet 
 Furnished by a charlatan 
 Posing as a pharmacist 
 Propped behind a pearly desk 
 She hoists the phone with burdened breath 
 And hands she holds for reasons wanton 
 Is the whirling dervish games 
 This is just the receptionist 
 The skeletons and hallowed halls 
 Outnumber every worker bee buzzing right through this honey comb 
 And I am just a lonely drone 
 With a notepad and a picture phone 
 Whose nectar is a collection of transgressions and subversive flaws 
 Darrell's darling carries all of HR on his back 
 Can only hide Gisette because the fetish waftings of croquettes 
 Well Mrs. Darla's down the hall 
 She keeps a watchful eye 
 It's on accounts receivable 
 Leaving it blind to the concubine 
 Lady Darla's not the cleanest 
 Grape inside the crops 
 She keeps her eyes inside accountants 
 As she skims right off the top 
 Her saccharine little skins of cream 
 She sneaks out in her hosiery 
 To hopefully she pumps the petty plunder in the slots 
 Every now and then 
 The best laid plans of mice and men 
 Fall apart at hands 
 Of unassuming champions 
 Collecting all the dirt 
 To build a tower to the sky 
 Slaving in this basement 
 One day this will all be mine 
 One day this will all be mine 
 One day this will all be mine 
 She was so outwardly nonpareil 
 I was enraptured by the act 
 Of cracking her seamless shell 
 Catching Esteban with hand in his till is muy facil 
 But this girl's skills are past the run of the mill 
 We command with abandon the plot 
 Take what he got 
 Setting up shop with a cloud 8 view at the top 
 And everybody's got bones 
 Hers are harder to spot 
 With her appointments pinned down and her hair done up 
 I devote everything that I've got 
 To stalking this fox 
 There's got to be a fracture in her porcelain plot 
 That's where I slipped up 
 Lost in her wash 
 She doubled back upon her tracks and she caught me off guard 
 She's impossibly smart 
 I am defeated at my own game 
 Caught me collecting dirt 
 To blackmail them for my own gain 
 A tower made of dirt 
 Is just a castle built from glass 
 And a pocket full of stones until the last one's cast 
 Every now and then 
 The best laid plans of mice and men 
 Fall apart at hands 
 Of unassuming champions 
 Collecting so much dirt 
 That I was buried down alive 
 Slaving in this basement 
 Until the day I die 
 Until the day I die 
 Until the day I die
