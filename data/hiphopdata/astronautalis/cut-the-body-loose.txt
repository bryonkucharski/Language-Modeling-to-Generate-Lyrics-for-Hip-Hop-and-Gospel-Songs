We're all just waiting 
 For you to breathe 
 My knees bleed from praying 
 You'll wake from your sleep 
 Can't hear what I'm saying 
 No matter how I scream 
 We know the world 
 Is wasted on me 
 We know the world 
 Is wasted on me 
 The city still just a nightmare 
 Too quiet to handle 
 I drove through the night to get there 
 In spite of the damage 
 Had to come down a fire trail 
 Just to make our way home 
 Ain't no street signs 
 Up on any of them roads 
 Ain't no streets left 
 To put them signs back on 
 Hey buddy 
 Go on put that map down 
 This ain't that town no more 
 Them signs ain't no use 
 Go on, turn back now 
 Don't act proud 
 I think it's about time 
 To cut the body loose 
 Don't you think it's about time 
 We cut the body loose 
 We're all just waiting 
 For you to breathe 
 My knees bleed from praying 
 You'll wake from your sleep 
 Can't hear what I'm saying 
 No matter how I scream 
 We know the world 
 Is wasted on me 
 We know the world 
 Is wasted on me 
 Your hair broken by your surface 
 Like it birthed you 
 Crawled back on that bike 
 Empty handed too 
 You couldn't stand for it 
 Dragging him with you 
 I know you had to cut the body loose 
 I know you just had to cut the body loose 
 I think it's about time we cut the body loose 
 'Cause I don't know how this can end 
 But I know we can't keep holding our breath 
 We're all just waiting 
 For you to breathe 
 My knees bleed from praying 
 You'll wake from your sleep 
 You can't hear what I'm saying 
 No matter how I scream 
 We know the world 
 Is wasted on me 
 We know the world 
 Is wasted on me
