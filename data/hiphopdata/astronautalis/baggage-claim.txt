:Sample: 
 The ghost is sitting blistering in baggage claim, like a sinner at the pearly gates praying Saint Peter shout my name 
 Your thrift store suitcases to the gaudy faces to becoming queen the fax machine transmitting all the shirts and things 
 Hoping maybe the lady I'm saving from a fluorescent Hades, escapes the ticket thrown away inside the case 
 Maybe she's gone missing by mix up or hiccup that switches the terminal change lane blame the plane 
 Either way I ain't gonna leave today without seen her face, I mean this place is poison 
 I can get a taste trade my hope for an antidote to maybe make my escape, but I go back into the flames to ensure that she is ok 
 They say its just a phase, they tell me sit and wait, they say its on its way, they say that every face becomes a frame 
 Then cultivate a common name, pack my things to get on the plane an fly leave her standing at the baggage claim... 
 I ain't gone leave with empty hands, I ain't gonna leave with empty hands (X2)

 Some maybe wrong because I did this fast and also he did a reverse reverb on the vocals as well as other effects... I came in here and corrected a lot of it, some of it is still wrong, maybe a word or two. It's much closer than it was though.
