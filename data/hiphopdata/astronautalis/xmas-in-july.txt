I'm a man who fell in love with a house and a couch 
 A whole lonely kingdom a mouse could carve out 
 The smell of dried wood, lost love-letters left out 
 The space heaters believers got their reaoners down 
 Sit silent and smile and take in this evening 
 Cinnamon dreaming, lazy breathing, the anachronist grieving 
 Well the kitchen's a stone's throw, think the toilet is leaking 
 Pump the place full of gasoline but damn it I ain't leaving 
 Well Christmas said goodbye 
 Christmas never came 
 Christmas showed up in July and now that bastard's here to stay 
 And I don't really mind if no gifts come my way 
 As long as you lock the doors and draw the shades 
 And always let me stay 
 I'm a man who fell in love with some stones and a one-legged bird 
 And cat that don't like me stepping on cracks and curbs 
 The spiral staircase is laughing as I just slip like a jerk 
 I'm sorry if I get too tipsy from toasting your worth 
 You don't ever have to wake me it's all just the same 
 I sleep like a hooker with a bullet in her brain 
 Bury me down in the tomb of blankets and some old sheets 
 If Christmas is here to stay well then you'll never get me to leave 
 And Christmas said goodbye 
 And Christmas never came 
 Christmas showed up in July and now that bastard's here to stay 
 And I don't really mind if no gifts come my way 
 As long as you lock the doors and draw the shades 
 And always let me stay 
 Always let me stay 
 Me stay 
 Let me stay 
 All right 
 Everybody now 
 Christmas said goodbye 
 (Goodbye) 
 Christmas never came 
 (Never came) 
 Christmas showed up in July 
 (In July) 
 And now that bastard's here to stay 
 (Again) 
 And I don't really mind 
 (Don't mind) 
 If no gifts come my way 
 (No gifts) 
 As long as you lock the doors and draw the shades 
 And always let me stay
