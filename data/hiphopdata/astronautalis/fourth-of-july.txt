 Three hundred butterflies 
 They wrapped them in her ribs 
 And now she cuts across the interstate 
 The world will choke on traffic 
 three hundred butterflies, they wrapped them in her ribs 
 Me and the cannonball's looking at the moon 
 and now she cuts across the interstate, the world will choke on traffic 
 Who’s peeking over the edge like no-good-kids with water balloons 
 (the apple in your eye is pretty rotten, it's full of worms) 
 I want to swallow the wind, let it hollow me thin 
 three hundred butterflies, they wrapped them in her ribs 
 (and the windows to your soul are filled with cataracts and scratches) 
 And call a friend who’s laughing like, laughing like a criminal 
 and now she cuts across the interstate, the world will choke on traffic 
 (the apple in your eye is pretty rotten, it's full of worms) 
 She watches fireworks launching and sparkling, spinning 
 three hundred butterflies, they wrapped them in her ribs 
 (and the windows to your soul are filled with cataracts and scratches) 
 And twenty kids live like giants making yearbook material 
 and now she cuts across the interstate, the world will choke on traffic 
 Step by step by misstep 
 nothing more heartbreaking than 
 Oops, I found myself in someone else’s shoes 
 a car that’s been stationed since… 
 And step by step by misstep 
 well, long enough, and long enough 
 Oops, I found myself in someone else's shoes 
 to let the grass grow up around its feet 
 Step by step by misstep 
 nothing more heartbreaking than 
 Oops, I found myself in someone else’s shoes 
 a car that’s been stationed since… 
 And step by step by misstep 
 well, long enough, and long enough 
 Oops, I found myself in someone else's shoes 
 to let the grass grow up around its feet 
 Later I’ll kiss the smile off your face 
 And toss this shape into the Rio Grande 
 I could follow it along the riverbank 
 To reach the beach 
 And we could roll around in the sand 
 I want to break the bank, and crush the glasses 
 Chase the tape, combat molasses 
 Face-to-face I punch the mattress 
 Awake, escape, and trace the atlas 
 They case the place and ban the back flips 
 Leave the flashes to the books of matches 
 Today’s the day 
 Today’s the day 
 They catch us 
 Today’s the day 
 Today’s the day 
 We turn it backwards 
 Today is the day 
 Amazing things happen 
 Pass the buck, I’ve got a head full of handshakes 
 nothing more heartbreaking than 
 Dig a little deeper ‘til the hole runs dry 
 a car that’s been stationed since… 
 As the light from the television flickers on the table 
 well, long enough, and long enough 
 And the angel on my shoulder wipes the sleep from his eyes 
 to let the grass grow up around its feet 
 Pass the buck, I’ve got a head full of handshakes 
 nothing more heartbreaking than 
 Dig a little deeper ‘til the hole runs dry 
 a car that’s been stationed since… 
 As the light from the television flickers on the table 
 well, long enough, and long enough 
 And the angel on my shoulder wipes the sleep from his eyes 
 to let the grass grow up around its feet 
 Pass the buck, I’ve got a head full of handshakes 
 nothing more heartbreaking than 
 (we're looking in) 
 Dig a little deeper ‘til the hole runs dry 
 a car that’s been stationed since… 
 As the light from the television flickers on the table 
 well, long enough, and long enough 
 (on a better life) 
 And the angel on my shoulder wipes the sleep from his eyes 
 to let the grass grow up around its feet 
 Pass the buck, I’ve got a head full of handshakes 
 nothing more heartbreaking than 
 (with our faces) 
 Dig a little deeper ‘til the hole runs dry 
 a car that’s been stationed since… 
 As the light from the television flickers on the table 
 (pressed against the glass) 
 well, long enough, and long enough 
 And the angel on my shoulder wipes the sleep from his eyes 
 to let the grass grow up around its feet 
 (and now you've turned away) 
 I want to jump a million miles 
 Look back at the lights 
 I want to run so fast it gets left behind 
 I want to jump a million miles 
 Look back at the lights 
 I want to run so fast it gets left behind 
 I want to jump a million miles 
 Look back at the lights 
 I want to run so fast it gets left behind 
 I want to jump a million miles 
 Look back at the lights 
 I want to run so fast it gets left behind 
 Teeth bared, broken noses 
 I want to jump a million miles, look back at the lights 
 Twisted fingers, swollen toes 
 I want to run so fast it gets left behind 
 And I could do with another drink 
 I want to jump a million miles, look back at the lights 
 I could do with another 
 I want to run so fast it gets left behind 
 Teeth bared, broken noses 
 I want to jump a million miles, look back at the lights 
 Twisted fingers, swollen toes 
 I want to run so fast it gets left behind 
 And I could do with another drink 
 I want to jump a million miles, look back at the lights 
 I could do with another 
 I want to run so fast it gets left behind 
 I want to jump a million miles 
 Look back at the lights 
 I want to run so fast it gets left behind 
 I want to jump a million miles 
 Look back at the lights 
 I want to run so fast it gets left behind 
 I want to jump a million miles 
 Look back at the lights 
 I want to run so fast it gets left behind 
 I want to jump a million miles 
 Look back at the lights 
 I want to run so fast it gets left behind 
 Nothing more heartbreaking than 
 I want to jump a million miles, look back at the lights 
 A car that’s been stationed since… 
 I want to run so fast it gets left behind 
 Well, long enough, and long enough 
 I want to jump a million miles, look back at the lights 
 To let the grass grow up around its feet 
 I want to run so fast it gets left behind 
 Nothing more heartbreaking than 
 I want to jump a million miles, look back at the lights 
 A car that’s been stationed since… 
 I want to run so fast it gets left behind 
 Well, long enough, and long enough 
 I want to jump a million miles, look back at the lights 
 To let the grass grow up around its feet 
 I want to run so fast it gets left behind 
 Nothing more heartbreaking than 
 I want to jump a million miles, look back at the lights 
 A car that’s been stationed since… 
 I want to run so fast it gets left behind 
 Well, long enough, and long enough 
 I want to jump a million miles, look back at the lights 
 To let the grass grow up around its feet 
 I want to run so fast it gets left behind 
 Nothing more heartbreaking than 
 I want to jump a million miles, look back at the lights 
 A car that’s been stationed since… 
 I want to run so fast it gets left behind 
 Well, long enough, and long enough 
 I want to jump a million miles, look back at the lights 
 To let the grass grow up around its feet 
 I want to run so fast it gets left behind 
 I want to jump a million miles 
 Look back at the lights 
 I want to run so fast it gets left behind
