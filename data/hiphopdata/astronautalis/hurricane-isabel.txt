Teenage girls on skateboards 
 Riding past my window 
 Storm rolls in from Africa 
 And rain falls on the shingles 
 Teenage girls and skinny bones 
 Running from the rain 
 Power cuts out on the neighborhood 
 And I'm in the dark again 
 She had bare ankles, that's a plus 
 Simple desire and demand met 
 By the girl who swore to God 
 That cold would cause her untimely death 
 God swore, 
 "Bless the little one" 
 But then this off his dirty secret 
 Baby blue gossiped green his gossamer halo polished 
 I rub my handle upon my sleeve 
 And my apple upon the other 
 I see which one of these is coming clean 
 And which wasn't worth the bother 
 I got a job that I am saving for 
 A wife and kids I'm waiting for 
 It's kinda hard to be facing north 
 When you got a head full of things you can't afford 
 Please, take my hand and hold them 
 Please, take them away from me 
 They do me far more harm than they ever could promise 
 To protect me from the sea 
 And I got a feeling 
 This thought, it isn't so far out of the left side 
 It's me verse the horseshoe 
 The corkscrew, and the next guy 
 A dream as American as missionary sex erector sets and apple pie 
 And I swear I'll never, ever, ever make it out of this, this, this god-forsaken land 
 And I swear I'll never, ever, ever make it out of this, this, this god-forsaken land 
 And I swear I'll never, ever, ever make it out of this, this, this god-forsaken land 
 Teenage girls and skinny bones 
 Riding past my window 
 Storm rolls in from Africa 
 And rain falls on the shingles 
 Teenage girls on skateboards 
 Running from the rain 
 Power cuts out on the neighborhood 
 And I'm in the dark again
