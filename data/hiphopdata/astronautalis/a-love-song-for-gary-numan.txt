I won't waste your time, 
 With nuts and bolts and pens and dimes, 
 I dream I'm color blind and lisp, can you, 
 Hear them calling from Hammersmith, 
 All the punk rock kids, 
 In their beds dreamin' of hot licks, can you, 
 Hear them calling you now, you know, 
 This pretty tiger needs no electric friends, 
 All right, 
 All right, 
 Maybe we could pull a heist together, 
 Stay out late until our bones turn dim, 
 Two sharks learnin how to swim, 
 I could learn to be a man and better, 
 A crap artist just knows the trick, 
 Just the trick to steal the show, 
 Right from under his friends, 
 Let's go start a band, 
 Name it something no one understands, we'll 
 Circumnavigate the globe, 
 In a plane made up of aluminum cans, 
 We can bust on out this place together, 
 Hijack a jetplane and wave goodbye, 
 They'll never forget you, but no one can catch you, 
 Live the dreams of pirates, thieves, smugglers and spies, all right, 
 I thought I had control, you know, 
 The devil never needs I told you so's, 
 You're always somewhere halfway home, 
 It's funny how our hands seem so damn close, 
 I thought I had control, you know, 
 The devil never needs I told you so's, 
 You're always somewhere halfway home, 
 It's funny how our hands seem so damn close, 
 I thought I had control, you know, 
 I thought I had control, you know, 
 I thought I had control, you know, 
 The devil never needs I told you so's.
