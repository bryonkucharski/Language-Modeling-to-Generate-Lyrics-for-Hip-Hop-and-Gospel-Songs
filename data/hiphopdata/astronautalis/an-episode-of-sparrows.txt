Just as the last of the hay was cut today 
 The threshers were resting, gelding slow in his gait 
 The sun's work is done but he's still flush in the face 
 Across the wet sky spreads an inky black stain 
 An episode of sparrows 
 Like you've never seen 
 An episode of sparrows 
 That you wouldn't believe 
 An obsidian stream of petite passerines 
 Swiftly eclipsing Helios' beams 
 My wife, oblivious, whistling, snapping beans 
 Witnessed a sight mine eyes had never seen 
 An episode of sparrows 
 Spelling my name 
 An episode of sparrows 
 A flawless display 
 An airborne ballet, the swarming songbirds spell my name 
 Quite deftly expressed by amassing each letter's shape 
 In this, they confessed they suffered from hunger pains 
 And failure to feed them to taste would lead them to lay waste to my hay 
 So 
 An episode of sparrows 
 Shaking me down 
 An episode of sparrows 
 Committing racketeering 
 Knowing the cost if I lost my crops 
 The thought of my wife packing bags and running home 
 With no choices left my heart sank in my chest 
 On an exhaling breath I shouted, "Honey, we're having guests... I guess." 
 An episode of sparrows 
 Has eaten all my food 
 An episode of sparrows 
 Has drank all my booze 
 An episode of sparrows 
 Didn't do no damn dishes 
 An episode of sparrows 
 Flew off all fat and drunk on my shit
