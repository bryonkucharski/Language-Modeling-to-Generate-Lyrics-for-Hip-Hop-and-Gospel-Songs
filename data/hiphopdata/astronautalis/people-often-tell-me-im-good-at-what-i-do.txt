I like living, it's easy 
 Moves like a gift in a weather that's breezy 
 Blew by my lips 
 Shakes like the uneasy when seduced by a kiss 
 I wanna slide my hand underneath your pillow where it fits 
 Walk to the ocean and wait for your orders 
 Sit up all night, watch the blue lights flick on the water 
 It's all right if you never show 
 Just the idea that you might's enough to keep my head afloat 
 I guess its all to common for people my height 
 Walk around, head in the clouds, ducking under streetlights 
 Hate the phone, the fax, the emails and the rest 
 Handwritten messages always seem to say it best 
 But once the pencil hits the paper and the pigs in the poke 
 Addressed in Sunday's best with a stamp on the front 
 Teady to drop inside the box and take flight with the storks 
 I can't seem to placate dreams and commit to the cause 
 I got a box of old letters, a brain filled with buzzards, 
 Ready to swoop down and pick apart my pain from my druthers 
 It's inane and it hovers, at the back of your thoughts 
 Like poppin' pills dry inside the throat that get caught 
 I guess I was just scared it'd come out wrong, 
 So instead of sending those letters I wrote you this terrible song. 
 I guess, I'm still really scared, 
 And that's the way it goes with being unprepared. 
 I wanna write good songs that we all sing along to 
 When the lights go up and the night's all through 
 I wanna write good songs that we all sing along to 
 When the lights go up and the night's all through 
 I wanna write good songs that we all sing along to 
 When the lights go up and the night's all through 
 I wanna write good songs that 
 I wanna write good songs that 
 I wanna write good songs that 
 I wanna write good songs 
 I know I should have called you I know its six to seven digits 
 Misdirected by reflections and flickering televisions 
 Sometimes I like to steal odds and ends from peoples houses 
 New q-tips night-standing, digging pennies out of couches 
 I got a set of sticky fingers and a back built for hammocks 
 But this ain't no doctor's note and I ain't no blank canvas 
 It's just the way the pen is, I'm good at what I do 
 From failing to falling in and out of touch with you 
 I wanna shake hands with the world and make mix tapes for America 
 And find the time to tell you the things I normally find embarrassing 
 You've always been fantastic, I've been foolish and sub-par 
 I hope for your sake, you're hearing this song in a bar 
 Hope for your sake, you're hearing this song in a bar 
 Hope for your sake, you're hearing this song in a bar 
 Hope for your sake, you're hearing this song in a bar 
 Hope for your sake, you're hearing this song in a bar 
 I wanna write good songs that we all sing along to 
 When the lights go up and the night's all through 
 I wanna write good songs that we all sing along to 
 When the lights go up and the night's all through 
 I wanna write good songs that we all sing along to 
 When the lights go up and the night's all through 
 I wanna write good songs 
 I wanna write good songs 
 (good songs) 
 I wanna write good songs 
 I wanna write good songs 
 Good songs 
 Good songs 
 Good songs
