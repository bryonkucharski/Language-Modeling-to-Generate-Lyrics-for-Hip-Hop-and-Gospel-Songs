You left me standing on the edge of the lake 
 They all left for Rome, but I couldn't get a passport today 
 I guess a mistake they said it just slipped their mind 
 And I am standing here all alone grinding my time 
 Went to the man in the government office 
 Asked him how fast I could get a ticket of this 
 Silly ride we call my dying days inside of this place 
 He said "Your warrant's for arrest. We won't let you escape" 
 So I said "Okay, I guess I'll just wait" 
 Send me a postcard from the city of Rome 
 Tell me all the pretty things about the girls that you know 
 Buy me a bottle of wine and send it on air mail express 
 I'll drink it all alone inside my home by the lake in this mess 
 I'll send a, a thank you for not leaving in the night 
 At least saying goodbye and let me have my dignity right 
 I know I'm just a little sad bastard making a mess 
 Of this stupid little story that's dancin' in my head 
 But when I wake inside my bed and you're gone 
 I got nothin' better to do than stand outside 
 And wave to the geese flying over my front lawn 
 So I eat, sleep, drink and count the walls and tiles 
 And then I'll sit here and maybe try to crack a smile 
 But every day I sit and think of what you're doing right now 
 My friends and family skipped town - left me all alone in this crowd 
 And I know I'm just a sad excuse for... whatever - who cares 
 But bottom line is it's just a dream and I wake up right here 
 Next to you, next to your face and inside my bed 
 In my home in Jacksonville where no one's going anywhere 
 I still don't got a passport or a ticket of this ride 
 But fuckin' A, I'll stick around for the rest of my life 
 When I'm riding 'round the globe 
 And I'm doing this and I'm signin' that 
 And I'm trying 
 And I'm trying
