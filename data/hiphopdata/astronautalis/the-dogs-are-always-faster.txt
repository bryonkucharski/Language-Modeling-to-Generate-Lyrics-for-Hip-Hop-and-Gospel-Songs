It's so funny it makes me sick I guess the way your brain'll think 
 "Shit if I weren't being chased this'd be a nice place for a picnic" 
 The tree farm planted in neats and rows, the leaves and branches smack my face 
 I'm trying to escape I hear the braying hounds chase 
 They're giving me a run for my money as I am moving as fast as I can 
 And every once in a while it feels like I'm moving in slow motion again 
 But the rest of the world is moving at twice the speed I'm trying to make sense 
 And as the dogs are barkin' there's always guns to follow after me I guess 
 I hear their whistles and their calls braying the dogs right on 
 As the dogs are leading white people following with their guns under their arms 
 And I run as fast as I can through these woods, i'm breathing now 
 I feel my lungs explode as I move in fast forward - escape the crowd 
 It's my chance to get up out this mess - move as fast as I can 
 I wanna feel my lungs pump like pistons out of an engine, man 
 My head will explode as the veins pump inside my face 
 As I hear the dogs catch up to me as the slow motion takes place 
 And they are moving double quick and I'm trying to move fast 
 [???] maybe I could climb a tree and watch them all pass 
 I reach for the branches of the thickest tree right in my eye sight 
 The branches all seem slippery - like they've been covered in grease all night 
 As I try to climb and pull myself up and nothing happens 
 It's just more wasted time as they're gaining ground on me, captain 
 And I know this is my chance, I've got to run right now 
 So fuck a tree just run until my heart breaks down 
 So I'm pushing through the woods, double time and quicker speed 
 No dog can catch me as they move silent in slow motion see 
 And I am moving twice as fast [??? bitch/pitch?] 
 As I am trying to escape for a crime I know I didn't commit 
 And it makes no sense but I am just gonna keep pushing on 
 I feel my finger, legs and brains and arms slowly going numb 
 And there's nothing gonna stand inside of my way as I try to escape 
 No motherfucker will catch me, no, not today 
 And then it hits me like a pile of bricks - I'm standing right now 
 Trying to move fast and all of a sudden slow motion breaking down 
 And it feels like my arms are made in ten pound leather suit/soup 
 And I'm swimming under water as they're moving as fast as cars, dude 
 And I see 'em getting close - I feel their hot breath on my neck 
 And I reach around to try and strike 'em down to escape 
 And all of a sudden a bite takes inside my arm again 
 I feel the dogs teeth sink inside my tiny white skin 
 And I know it's all over and turn as I feel the warmth of the blood 
 Run down my skin and slowly check my form 
 And I look up at the sky and I see the stars flicker through 
 Inside the break, inside the pass, inside the tree farm dude 
 And I know I can die right here and be all content 
 Because I gave it all, I gave my damnedest and I'm gonna straight pay for it 
 If I go to heaven or hell or purgatory it doesn't matter to me 
 As their teeth sink inside my skin - rip me limb from limb see 
 I like the pain I like the death - give it to me now 
 I start laughing and screaming out as they tear me apart child 
 And there's nothing I can do so lets just bask in the glow 
 Of the pain and impending doom and the death they already know 
 And it's coming my way, bring it to me closer 
 A white light burns over my eyes and I know it's getting close 
 As my body starts to go cold and my brain doesn't make any sense and I'm losing all control 
 I start to twitch and shit and all of a sudden I get a bur in my ass 
 I ain't going out like this - I ain't dying, cat 
 And so I stand - walking dead, missing limbs and dripping blood 
 Fuck all you bastards, I am escaping and taking control 
 So I start running again - the dogs are equally surprised 
 I see the men standing there scratching all their arms and eyes 
 It's like I've never seen anything happen, this is the walking dead escape 
 I am so determined I promise I'll be up on my way 
 They never give chase the terror's what sets them 
 Leaves them standing like cement wet feet, dragging 'em down to the bottom of the water 
 Understand that I am leaving - not gonna go under their guns, under their ways 
 And I'm taking control of the show so I go 
 I go, I run, as fast as I can 
 And just when they're outta sight 
 I collapse 
 And die 
 And then I woke up
