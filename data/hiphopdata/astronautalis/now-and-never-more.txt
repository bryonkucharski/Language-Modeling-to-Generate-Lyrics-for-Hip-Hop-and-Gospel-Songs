I guess we're maybe just the lucky ones 
 The devil chose us and she left us some 
 I guess it's better that we're left alone 
 Now and never more 
 You can bet you can count on them right 
 Had to leave you in the middle of the night 
 I guess it's better that we're left this way 
 Now and never more 
 Now and never more 
 It's just seven steps to open every lock on my door 
 The thick oak boards would never surrender to anything 
 Short of forty-fours blastin' at the hinges 
 Mistakes never take more than six steps without the world endin' 
 So I can rest assured the locks'll never give, the chains'll never flinch 
 And no man but God can raise the bolts from the dead 
 And just for pinch, I leave a chair propped under the knob 
 Never too certain in this world gone lost 
 That's why I keep every window locked, latched under key 
 The only thing I trust is the floor steadfast under me 
 I know you're wondering what would drive a man to live like this 
 And what would happen if you accidentally slipped and hit your head 
 Lying passed out on the bathroom floor 
 Brain leakin', body weaken as the audience stands for the curtain call 
 And there is me, life flash before my eyes lookin' back 
 And laugh at times when I cut the telephone lines 
 And severed all ties, shut off the water and power 
 Sealed off from the steel hearts atop my ivory tower 
 I look down every now and then and hope she'll answer my call 
 But I know she's gone so what's the point of ever leaving at all 
 Ever leaving at all 
 Lock the door on your way out I'm leaving it all 
 Behind 
 Goodbye 
 I guess we're maybe just the lucky ones 
 The devil chose us and she left us some 
 I guess it's better that we're left alone 
 Now and never more 
 You can bet you can count on them right 
 Had to leave you in the middle of the night 
 I guess it's better that we're left this way 
 Now and never more 
 Now and never more 
 Awake with a bottle on the night-stand 
 Staring at me as it sparks reactions in my right hand 
 Grab hold as I continue this production 
 Of draining these fixations after drowning in dysfunction 
 The light from the atmosphere induces sensitivity 
 And burns my retinas in a fashion that convinces me 
 That this must be my punishment for those mistakes 
 That kept piling up until it crumbled on the sixth day 
 Now I stand in a carnival of nervous fans 
 Waiting for the moment to escape inside the caravan 
 Slam the door and tell the driver to accelerate 
 Toss my heavy baggage out and watch it all disintegrate 
 Sitting on a cushion still warm and broken in 
 From the last passenger that's still running from unspoken sins 
 Pull over, let me walk before the [rust?] grabs me 
 I will avoid all of the signs that say 'No Trespassing' 
 Step foot onto a trail of forgotten soles 
 Failing to admire cautions deeming me responsible 
 Head first without the proper education 
 Tampers with my pulse and my uneasy ventilation 
 Exhale watch the air escape my lips 
 Racing towards the surface as the current and the water shifts 
 There's no need to attempt to see her face 
 If I break the plan today I won't live past Thursday 
 So now I chose to become one with this tide 
 If it lands me on the shore where my integrity resides 
 Eyes closed it will work itself out 
 Alone and short-winded it will work itself out 
 I guess we're maybe just the lucky ones 
 The devil chose us and she left us some 
 I guess it's better that we're left alone 
 Now and never more 
 You can bet you can count on them right 
 Had to leave you in the middle of the night 
 I guess it's better that we're left this way 
 Now and never more 
 Now and never more
