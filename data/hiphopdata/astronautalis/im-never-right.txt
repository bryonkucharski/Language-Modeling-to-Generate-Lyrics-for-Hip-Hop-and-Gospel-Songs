Oh you, careless eyes 
 Oh you, happy bones 
 I'm never right, I'm never right, I hope 
 I'm never right, I'm never right, I hope 
 Oh you, milk soft hands 
 Oh, you, neatly combed 
 I'm never right, I'm never right, I hope 
 I'm never right, I'm never right, I hope 
 I am the one you sought 
 I ain't around the block 
 I've got the steady hands and a mean game of small talk 
 I put my quarters up and waited for left and lesson learned 
 I guess I got some questions had to just walk away 
 This is it, my last game 
 There's more than winning and losing 
 It's too late to save face 
 Ain't no man with strength in his hands 
 I'm just like you another pawn in play 
 Dreams where I can talk the talk and the ball is placed 
 I love the stain felt the small chinks I love the way the chalk tastes 
 I lean upon my hands stop them just before it falls away 
 Charge forward to future and watch the white ball race 
 A few were set askew for one and two with six and five 
 I couldn't believe my eyes the cue ball laid away split away into equal sides 
 The end is nigh I can feel a storm coming, its the first sign 
 Next generation of first born running the end is nigh 
 I can feel a storm coming, it's the first sign 
 Next generation of first borns running, the end is nigh 
 I can feel a storm coming, it's the first sign 
 Next generations of first born running, the end is nigh 
 I can feel a storm coming, it's the first sign 
 Next generations of first born running, the end is nigh 
 There's a midnight voice and I can hear its scream 
 She can't live my dreams if the sky falls asleep 
 It's all in my thought and deeds 
 My apologies lack protection collapsed in her affection, "naw," he cried, 
 Begging for her strength, strength my dusty tears bloody 
 Loving before this becoming, wondering if I could have ever saved myself 
 I felt my heart sink, I think you fell head over heels only to be let down 
 The stars don't seem so high and the world wont turn around 
 She says I'm so indifferent and I killed us both somehow 
 I reply that a dying man doesn't change, but I can't continue to exist 
 We won't see the light of day because tomorrow isn't promised 
 Oh you, careless eyes 
 Oh you, happy bones 
 Oh you, milk soft hands 
 Oh, you, neatly combed 
 I'm never right 
 I'm never right 
 I'm never right 
 I'm never right, I hope 
 I'm never right, I hope
