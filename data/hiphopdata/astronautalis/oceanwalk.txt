I saw the door and I looked through the entrance 
 Stare down night sky, dot pattern seeming endless 
 Broken friendship, dandy dog on leash 
 Door latch caught spot, shoe stomp on street 
 Tape deck plays and the reels will spin 
 Suburb sound close down as boom-bap begin 
 My red face hide in the shades of the trees 
 As buggered blue moonlight pass through the leaves 
 Carry out my concerning deeds in the deprivation of the darkness 
 The com-com-comfort of cave-dweller locked inside of an apartment 
 I spark this with the marked mistakes of minors learning 
 How to build a better book of matches by watching the fire burning 
 Count all my dreams on a pair of Pinocchio fingers 
 And trace the trail back home by the tumbling splinters 
 A silly beginner, basic apprentice aggression 
 In the absence of a master, trying to make up my own lesson 
 Who knew I would wait, I would wait such a long time 
 Who knew I would wait, I would wait such a long time 
 From the dreams to the leaves to the cracks in the pavement 
 To the roaches and rats to the armored cars pacing 
 From the spies to the thieves to the cross-eyed complainers 
 To the...ain't that long when you count out the paces 
 From the breach to the tracks to the aliens with statements 
 To the grief to the crap that they all want to wade in 
 To the forth and back, the forth and back 
 There's no turning back and back and back and back again 
 Secrets explode whether you mean it or not 
 I locked my dreams with the right keys but I worked the wrong locks 
 The strong box screws split quick before I could retighten 
 I learned lightning strikes and leaves before language leaks "it lightens" 
 The waking of the dead to live and work with the freaks 
 I was a vampire roaming streets when I would swear I'is asleep 
 The beeping of the buzzer burn my brain the next day 
 I tried to brush my teeth but never could remove the blood stains 
 A double life of moonlighting grows tiring from trying 
 If you got to work a day job and keep the villagers from rioting 
 The list of lies, lengthened longer, left life laymen honest 
 Invited the world into my home to show the bones stacked in my closet 
 A dumb little skeleton walking miles to chase a silly dream 
 Stubborn skull, split shoes, punctuated by abrasive feet 
 All the while stalking, walking, awkward through the night 
 In the stomach of the suburbs with a dog by my side 
 From the dreams to the leaves to the cracks in the pavement 
 To the roaches and rats to the armored cars pacing 
 From the spies to the thieves to the cross-eyed complainers 
 To the...ain't that long when you count out the paces 
 From the breach to the tracks to the aliens with statements 
 To the grief to the crap that they all want to wade in 
 To the forth and back, the forth and back 
 There's no turning back and back and back and back again 
 From the dreams to the leaves to the cracks in the pavement 
 To the roaches and rats to the armored cars pacing 
 From the spies to the thieves to the cross-eyed complainers 
 To the...ain't that long when you count out the paces 
 From the breach to the tracks to the aliens with statements 
 To the grief to the crap that they all want to wade in 
 To the forth and back, the forth and back 
 Forth and back and back and back again 
 From the dreams to the leaves to the cracks in the pavement 
 To the roaches and rats to the armored cars pacing 
 From the spies to the thieves to the cross-eyed complainers 
 To the...ain't that long when you count out the paces 
 From the breach to the tracks to the aliens with statements 
 To the grief to the crap that they all want to wade in 
 To the forth and back, the forth and back 
 There's no turning back and back and back and back again
