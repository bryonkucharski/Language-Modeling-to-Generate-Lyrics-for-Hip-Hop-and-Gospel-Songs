Well, all the cool kids in the north 
 Wishin' they were southern 
 So they wear boots 
 And drink whiskey just like Waylon 
 All the cool kids in the heart of Dixie 
 Try to shake they accent, heh 
 Before they move to Portland 
 All the thugs dress like punks 
 With studded leather belts, denim vests 
 And they start skateboarding, na na na 
 While all the punks dress like thugs 
 With New Era fitted caps, Snapbacks 
 White ones, and some clean Air Jordans 
 Kurt Cobain can smash all the guitars he like 
 'Cause he was rich as fuck 
 Just like John Lennon 
 And these days no one ever drowns in quicksand 
 Or dies from the plague, yup 
 The Golden Age is boring 
 I swore I heard Andre 3K say one day, ay 
 That rap was a young man's game game game 
 I never thought I'd be pushing fucking 33, see 
 Still making a living off the things that I say 
 But, hey, Rap is dead, Punk is dead 
 We all seen the T-shirt 
 When the drugs kick in and it thumps like this 
 Dancing till our feet hurt 
 Some old man is swearing 
 "Vote for me, it ain't gon' be worse" 
 But I hate to burst your bubble, baby 
 It's gon' be worse 
 So me first, leave first 
 Katrina breaks them damn dykes 
 What would you do 
 For some freedom and a Klondike? 
 I'll screw with you 
 When our bosses all just decide 
 Life would be better for them 
 If they laid you off and just said goodnight 
 Gun pulled on me by a cop one time 
 Four guns pulled on me in Atlanta last night 
 What struck me as funny is that both damn times 
 The conversation started with the exact same line 
 Put up your hands 
 C'mon and put up your hands 
 Put up your hands 
 C'mon and put up your hands 
 Put up your hands 
 C'mon and put up your hands 
 Put up your hands 
 C'mon and put up your hands 
 I'm from the state of the 20G rim 
 Sitting up under five hundred dollar linen 
 Pushing this whip, best be bringing your friends 
 Because you'll be pushing this whip 
 When it breaks down again 
 I'm from the nation of that war on drugs 
 40 billion a year, can't ball like us 
 They, bring in the coca and we bring in the guns 
 Just kill a few soldiers push the coke price up 
 It's all, lucrative business, lipstick-on-a-pig shit 
 Yeah, the coupe is horrendous 
 But the rims are stupendous 
 Go ahead and just tell me 
 You know how you can end this 
 Middle-of-the-mall ball 
 Till you fall with a fake-ass pendent 
 While you waiting in line to cop an iPhone 5 
 So you can post some pictures of places 
 You've been in your life 
 Go on and bump this on your Beats By Dre 
 At work staring at the sky 
 My homies said, "Fuck a business loan!" 
 They stole copper pipes 
 Rap is dead, Punk is dead, we all seen that t-shirt 
 Drugs kick in and it thumps like this 
 Dancing 'til our feet hurt 
 Some old man is swearing 
 "Vote for me! It ain't gon' be worse" 
 But I hate to burst your bubble, baby 
 It's gon' be worse 
 So fuck them and fuck this 
 I'm off to live my own life 
 What would you do for some freedom and a Klondike? 
 I'm fucking through, so from now on I am on my 
 All news is bad news, everything is alright 
 Put up your hands 
 C'mon and put up your hands 
 Put up your hands 
 C'mon and put up your hands 
 Put up your hands 
 C'mon and put up your hands 
 Put up your hands 
 C'mon and put up your hands 
 Your hands 
 Damn
