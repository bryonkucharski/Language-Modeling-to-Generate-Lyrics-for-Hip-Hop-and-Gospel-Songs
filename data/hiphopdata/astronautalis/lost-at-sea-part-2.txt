Everyone better get it together and get a better idea exactly how their favorite story should end. 
 We've all woken from the same glorious dream, it's full of hope it ain't just wrinkled sheets and another empty bed. 
 Are you so dumb to ask me why it never ends and why the hunter only loves the prey he never can get? 
 The only sucker dumb enough to get dipped into the Styx, he caught a cold, there's nothing certain with love and other train wrecks. 
 She came in like a gun and made me run until my lungs were finally up and ready to call it quits. 
 I love the chase, she loved the taste, the trap of being everyone's catch that almost always gave the slip. 
 It's just a kiss and what's the worst to come of this? It's fun to think of what a bit of trouble can get. 
 Come on in, the city thins and horns and things seem faraway from the 60 steps it takes to get from the doorstep to my bed. 
 ...And this is all I said.
