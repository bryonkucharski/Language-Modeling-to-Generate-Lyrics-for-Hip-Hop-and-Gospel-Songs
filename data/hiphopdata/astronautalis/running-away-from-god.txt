Even after six months, NOLA still a wreck 
 The 9th Ward still had water to your chest 
 Under I-10, they piled dead cars 
 Ever seen an ambulance with high water marks? 
 And they don’t dance no more, all we do is flinch 
 Brace for that old taste that chase a strong fist 
 With blood on lips and flooded bricks 
 Taste that whiskey kiss, born sweaty and free 
 Fuck a club, mu'fucker, take that shit to the streets, G 
 We were born running away from God, away from God 
 We were born running away, away 
 We were born running away from God, away from God 
 We were born running away 
 "10 euros, that's cheap for sure." 
 He said it all in broken words 
 "But these people ain't got nothing 
 They'd rather drink what they have than buy your merch." 
 Čadca isn’t pretty, but Tatranský works 
 Thick liquor dark brown, made of secret herbs 
 Slovakia'll get busy, they don’t need no words 
 And anything is a club if the speakers work, ey 
 Turn it up till it shakes the rafters 
 No kings, no gods, no masters 
 Beat build while the euro collapsing 
 Little kids are tagging "All cops are bastards" 
 AntiFa is passin', in they old jean jackets 
 They don't need no magic just to make this happen 
 Make out, make due, make the best of what you got 
 And turn the volume up till it shakes the rafters 
 Till it shakes the rafters 
 Till it shakes the rafters 
 Till it shakes the rafters 
 We make our own disasters 
 We were born running away from God, away from God 
 We were born running away, away 
 We were born running away from God, away from God 
 We were born running away 
 Ey Ey Ey Ey 
 We ain't no gangsters 
 We ain't no thugs 
 We all just flesh and blood 
 And we don't need you to mess it up 
 We independent son, we dig our own graves 
 Salt our own lands, make our own plagues just for fun 
 And you can test us, come 
 We'll be waiting by that front gate with the Beam up in our cup 
 And I'm dumbfound how in my home town 
 Cops come, they all just run 
 Landlord wants us out 
 We pack our bags and shut the whole thing up 
 So I was like, "Aight 
 What you do when police come through to shake you down?" 
 Laughed out loud and said 
 "We lock them motherfuckers out!" 
 That's a true story
