He was a dealer of dirty jokes breathing unfiltered Camel smoke 
 And everything he said was a lie but he had me by the rope 
 The noose around my neck with every yawning story that he told 
 But I still listened there, bended ear hoping I'd come close 
 To touch the truth and hit the root of the life that he lived 
 He never ran guns or shot pool with any famous chicks 
 Phil Spector wasn't his bitch waitin' on his lips 
 For a little bit of cocaine or braceful beautiful wish 
 I know my words will slip and I know I tell a couple lies 
 I've known to accentuate; exaggeratin' stories all the time 
 And I wonder why, will it magnify by the time I reach fifty 
 And realise my life never turned out the way I planned it simply 
 So I gotta stretch the truth and tell the things I never did 
 Until I'm runnin' guns with Saddam Hussain and all his stupid kids 
 So I wonder why he'd tell those lies and breath it down my neck 
 A bunch of foul smoke inside of my ears on whiskey breath 
 And I'm sittin' here - a little kid right in front of his chair 
 Tellin' another story c'mon Uncle bend my freakin' ear 
 I wanna hear the tale, tell me time again over now 
 How you were runnin' drugs across the border from the north on down 
 To Alaska, along the oil pipeline and into Canada 
 Taking 'em down through Washington state and hanging out 
 And doing damage to the brain that God gave 'im wonderin' what I understand 
 If you don't have the truth how can I shake your hand see 
 And I got a couple questions that make me a little curious, homie 
 Doesn't the story make up the man when the man makes up the story? 
 There was never stolen cars, there was always a couple bars 
 There was eyes full of stars and a lack-luster fallin hard 
 And everything I understood that you done with your life 
 Has all just been sacrificed upon the cross of truth tonight 
 See, I seen it all breakin' down, a sad old man 
 With a couple bruised rib cages and a shaky left hand 
 His beard is scraggly and the top of his head is goin' bald 
 And it's all peeling away, falling back, all the stories that he told 
 And I wonder where I can find the truth inside this now 
 It's more than the toast, it's the crumbs of the motherfucker breakin' down 
 And watchin' after sixty five years upon this earth 
 What happens to everything that you thought made up your worth 
 And see I know there's a couple bits of truth in all of this 
 There was no stolen cars, there was a couple of stolen kisses 
 Couple of illegitimate kids, a couple of broken bottles 
 And all the time in prison, all the time inside the hospital 
 Was the thing that was real without the mass appeal 
 The truth is always the ugliest side so should polish it up for real 
 And so it makes you wonder 
 Why would this motherfucker tell me all these lies 
 And pull the rug out under the covers 
 And I'm lookin' at him now, stare inside his sunken eyes 
 And realise he ain't the bit of wisdom, the super-sized guy 
 He's just an old man, slow hand, stumbblin' breath 
 Just tryin' to make it up the stairs without losing, pains in chests 
 And I think what will happen to me when I wake up from this dream 
 And realise I'm twenty four see and I got a couple years left 
 A couple beers left, a couple friends left, a couple grindin' gears left 
 And I'm breakin' sweat and wonderin' one day how I will be breakin' down 
 And live in an old folks town wearin' my tattered broken crown 
 And I'll be wavin' a hand for servants that answer no beck and call 
 Because everyone has left standing me holdin' my balls 
 And I got to make ends meat in this thing I called my life 
 The bitter circle ring that made me back to the beginning right 
 I started to help this baby into this way in a wheelchair maybe 
 And now I gotta act, maybe explain the way that I was so crazy 
 Tell you why I lived this stupid lie that I did 
 And all the time that I spent chasin' around girls and chicks 
 And all the time that ain't for shit, you told me the truth 
 The truth is you can't lie if you gotta try to produce because 
 Life'll bite you in the ass in the end 
 And then you're standin' there on the corner without any friends 
 Because all your friends know what happens after it's done 
 Because at least one person was there to witness all the truth, son
