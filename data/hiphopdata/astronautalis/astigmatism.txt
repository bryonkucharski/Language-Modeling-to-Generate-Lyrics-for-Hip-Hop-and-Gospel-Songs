A little kid turns the corner, quick on his feet 
 My vision's no good no more; he's just a smudge in the street 
 The colors blur in my eyes just like ink in the rain 
 The city, soaked in its lights, is slowly washing away 
 Everything is just a background, waiting to take shape and appear 
 Inside my windshield eyes with Vaseline tears 
 Muffled chuckles and leaky ceilings 
 Hazy coffee stains, collectible keyrings 
 A scrapbook of snapshots taken in shaky concealment 
 Never trusted my love and her wallpaper feelings 
 There's something so comforting about her uncertain arms 
 There's beauty in danger, safety in harm 
 A five dollar psychic offers bargain predictions 
 Connecting my murdering a mantis to my moderate affliction 
 Once when I was a child I ran to my door; upon grabbing the knob 
 I crushed the prostrate bug inside of my palm 
 I watched his little green frame fall far from my hand 
 I guess his prayers were never answered by God, He got the upper hand 
 Struck blind over time inside flashes in steps 
 We all pay for our sins in the most subtle respects 
 How quick we forget how fast the past is washed away 
 Diluted in music, TV, and the talk of the day 
 How slick a little kiss can get her bony hips to block the way 
 Lend the world your ears and they'll just sweet-nothing it all away 
 You made your bed 
 Now, you must sleep 
 Underneath the sheets 
 There's something inside this house, footsteps by the couch 
 It's all shade and shadows tracking the suspect silence down 
 It's not the sounds they make, it's all the noises that we never hear 
 Old cliches on attraction, raindrops after the weather clears 
 Tapping fingers for living; counting out the notes 
 The door ticks when it sits open and rattles when clicks closed 
 Twelve lines, one in the light switch, a chip in the globe 
 The radiator is always breathing, teeth clenched and lips float 
 It's more than I bargained for, but nothing I can't handle 
 I learned to listen for the kitchen, feel dust fall on the mantle 
 Everything is done in inches, fingertips, and little skills 
 Nothing is done quickly except tying shoes and electric bills 
 The relentless drills, constant repetition, daily grind 
 Same set of pants put on one leg at a time 
 Every morning's filled with breath and the rest is just fine 
 I never forget my mistakes but sometimes I forget I'm blind
