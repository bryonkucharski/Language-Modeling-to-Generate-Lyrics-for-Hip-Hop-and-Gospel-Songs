Me and Fat Joe sat inside the back of an industrial-strength delivery van 
 I couldn't catch a clear view of the drivers face 
 But I could tell it wasn't a feminine friend 
 The ground plans for battle were all laid 
 We were just takin' some time to kick it, eat grapes and parlay 
 It was just him and me in a van with the gate agate 
 We taste the grapes, spit the seeds in the street 
 The highway was a scalpel splicing the sands 
 Impressive impression of man's demand for the connection of lands 
 I look back at Joe and laugh 
 Give the grapes a puff and a pass, spitting another seed out of the back 
 Joe squints his eyes, lets out a sound that can only be described as 
 A laughter and a sad goodbye 
 His pale olive fingers pry another one of the fruits of the vine 
 "We should return in ten years time" 
 I ask him why 
 "So we can drink the wine from the orchard that has grown 
 From the seeds we alone cast aside" 
 As the sun sank lower on the sand 
 Dust sprayed from the tyres that picked up the grains 
 Displayed them in spirals 
 Held the last grape up to eclipse the sun 
 The breeze plucked from my fingers and the lunch was done 
 My father was an engine driver 
 Grandpa fought some wars 
 Hope that I can maybe size up 
 Leave my mark at all 
 My father was an engine driver 
 Grandpa fought a wars 
 Hope that I can maybe size up 
 Leave my mark at all 
 Me and Tupac Shakur sat inside a doughnut shop 
 Sharing a dozen and watching our coffee cooling 
 One by one the box slowly emptied 
 From the cakes to crullers and at last the fancies 
 Pac sighed aloud so I could hear him 
 "Doughnuts are communism" 
 I asked him why 
 He said "Better in theory" 
 We laughed and scratched the sleep from our eyes 
 He said "This is ridiculous - twelve is too much half a dozen wastes our time" 
 "And every time we order twelve thinking we can handle it" 
 "Every time we end up pissed because we made our stomachs sick" 
 We both laugh a bit - gingerly sip our coffee 
 His fingers scrape the table top and he digs in it softly 
 And I watch him there - carving, scraping - sitting in silence 
 Engraves his name with the word "westside" beside it 
 Underneath the orange veneer of the doughnut shop gear 
 There's an earthy brown flesh that excavation makes appear 
 Year after year Pac and I return there 
 Table that he claimed with the matching bench chairs 
 Chug the last of our coffee and step to leave 
 Say "Peace" to the clerk, she says "Goodbye" in Chinese 
 Clutching our sick stomachs we both struggle to speak 
 Shake our heads, split our waists and say "See you next week" 
 My father was an engine driver 
 Grandpa fought some wars 
 Hope that I can maybe size up 
 Leave my mark at all 
 Leave my mark at all
