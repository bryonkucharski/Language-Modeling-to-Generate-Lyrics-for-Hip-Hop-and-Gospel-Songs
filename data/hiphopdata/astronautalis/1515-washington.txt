Pack 'em all in, four folks up inside a 3-bed 
 Fuck a landlord, make a room out the practice space 
 Run an orange line through the laundry room and be living 
 Three hundred a month, yup, all bills everything 
 Living off of rap, Ramen noodles and the kindest friends 
 Drugs will pay the rent, keep that party moving everyday 
 Vegan with the tracks, ain't no beef inside anything 
 Homies at your back, yep, you survived everything 
 Except that heat, believe in that 
 That smoke will fucking choke your lungs 
 Boy, that draft back will flash like a dagger drawn in a club 
 Smolder on the mattress till that O2 rolls through and blows it up 
 Turn everything to ashes, watch them firefighters soak it up 
 So, what would you grab 
 If your fucking house was burning down, two seconds to dash? 
 You ain't reaching for no Nikes, bitch don't make me laugh 
 See how simple your whole life is in the palm of your hand, damn 
 Oh, the smoke will lead you home 
 Oh, the smoke will lead you home 
 As I write this, Ukraine is burning 
 And the flames in Venezuela made Valencia an urn 
 My own personal history feels so damn worthless 
 And I wonder if I grabbed the right things when I escaped the burning building? 
 That silly feeling making your problems feel small 
 While simultaneously feeling helpless and numb to it all 
 Feel like a fucking asshole for all the shoes that I bought 
 Knowing they all just turned to ashes when the laces all caught 
 On fire, all night I couldn't sleep a wink, while looters broke in 
 And picked through our singed things 
 To sell it all for scratch so they could chase dreams 
 Or chase a high, or chase something else that's in between 
 Maybe I shouldn't have kept a goddamn thing 
 Let it all burn down start over, just slate clean 
 That's easy for me to say cause I didn't lose much 
 Except when I lost touch 
 Oh, the smoke will lead you home 
 Oh, the smoke will lead you home 
 The smoke will lead you home 
 The smoke will lead you home
