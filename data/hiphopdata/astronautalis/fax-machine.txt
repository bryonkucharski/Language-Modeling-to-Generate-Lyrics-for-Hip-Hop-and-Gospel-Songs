Everyone's called off the searches 
 Faces that nobody knows 
 The devil is hiding in churches 
 The sun has burned my eyes 
 Got me making that face again 
 I'm driving my dented car in donuts 
 Listening to that same old mixtape, my friend 
 The one that starts and ends 
 With odds and ends and a dumb dance song 
 As a troubled name with a subtle way 
 Is saying that she thinks that I'm handsome 
 As shuttles crash and buildings fall 
 And diseases fly on airplanes 
 I wonder where the romance has gone 
 got us by the purse stings 
 I want to build you a house 
 In the country, with the son of Michael Landon 
 But I want to protect my couch 
 And my collection of rusty handguns 
 It's as tough as nails, as tough as tigers 
 As tough as tricky shots 
 But I believe the dreams of my father 
 It's the only dreams that I've got 
 I've never seen the top 
 Give me a good, solid lay of the land 
 But I guess a guess is just a guess 
 And the first step to finding the facts at hand 
 I hate the bleeding hearts and hard-heads 
 As much as the nervous man hates the taste of a stutter 
 You know what they say: in the land of the blind 
 The man with one eye's on every tabloid cover 
 It's not a case of me vs. the others 
 1,000 monkeys vs. man 
 Before the Lord lays me down to sleep 
 I pray that you'll understand 
 I need my room to breathe 
 My own private patch of dirt 
 Where I can raise my sheep and make my beats 
 And teach my kids to curse 
 I need a sandwich and a hammock 
 But not a butler or a reporter 
 Just a couple good folk to watch my back 
 But never watch over my shoulder 
 It's as pretty as a picture 
 And it stands alone without a frame 
 That's why it sits all silent inside my wallet 
 Waiting for you to see my dreams
