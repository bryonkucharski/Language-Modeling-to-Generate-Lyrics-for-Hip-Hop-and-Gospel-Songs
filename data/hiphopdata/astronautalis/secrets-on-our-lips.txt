I know they say it's over, we can't go on like this 
 The moonlight makes us ardent and the sun returns our sense 
 But we ain't much for orders, we can't go on like this 
 But we can live forever with secrets on our lips 
 We work in secret under cover of darkness 
 Hands steadied by the weight of a lie 
 Broke branches, codes, and chalk markings 
 I'll leave a trail only you can find 
 All the alleys in Manhattan are gone, kid 
 They sold the shadows when the rent got high 
 So we sneak into the Central Park and 
 Work in secret for the rest of the night 
 We work in secret for the rest of the night 
 We work in secret for the rest of the night 
 We work in secret for the rest of the night 
 And keep it all a lie 
 I know they say it's over, we can't go on like this 
 The moonlight makes us ardent, the sun returns our sense 
 But we ain't much for orders, we can't go on like this 
 But we can live forever with secrets on our lips 
 We found a crawl space behind the vending machines 
 Pressed each other against each other until we fell asleep 
 Woken shirtless arm in arm by a cleaning lady's screams 
 Her bottom lip was swollen from being pressed between my teeth 
 I could have stayed there for weeks hands in her hair 
 Hands creeping innocent under the waist of my jeans 
 Fingertips tracing the shape of our lips 
 We spoke in breaths and that's it 
 It's not a bad life to live making out all day 
 Living off the food and drinks inside the vending machines 
 The sun's wide awake she rode off on her bike alone 
 I never saw her again, we never speak 
 The night before I met the girl I swore would change my life 
 Move across the country try to break a wild horse to a wife 
 But that heartbreak was years away, right? 
 And this girl was right here with locks to pick and trees to climb 
 I remember you well at the Thunderbird Motel 
 We were talking just so strange and so sweet 
 Two bits will buy you ten on the vibrating bed 
 I kissed your skin behind the vending machine 
 If you ask me right now why I never did tell 
 Anyone about our evening with me 
 I don't know, hell 
 Some secrets are just things that you keep 
 I know they say it's over, we can't go on like this 
 The moonlight makes us ardent and the sun returns our sense 
 But we ain't much for orders, we can't go on like this 
 But we can live forever with secrets on our lips 
 With secrets on our lips 
 With secrets on our lips 
 With secrets on our lips 
 With secrets on our lips 
 With secrets on our lips 
 With secrets on our lips 
 With secrets on our lips 
 With secrets on our lips
