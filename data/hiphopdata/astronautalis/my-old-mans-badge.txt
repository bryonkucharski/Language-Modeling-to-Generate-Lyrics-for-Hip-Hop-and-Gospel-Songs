You say the world's in shambles and the kids have lost their minds, 
 You can have your heroes. 
 Your heroes ain't mine. 
 They swear I'm just an idealist and my faith is blind, 
 They can have their heroes. 
 Their heroes ain't mine. 
 My old man ain't got no medals, he ain't never saved no one's life, 
 But he worked his finger's raw to provide for his lovely wife. 
 So, you say the world's in shambles and the kids have lost their mind. 
 You can have your heroes. 
 Your heroes ain't mine.
