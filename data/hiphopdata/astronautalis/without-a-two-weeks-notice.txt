It's just a job and like any other I've ever had 
 I need a couple bucks to pay some bills fast 
 Food, clothes and gas and all that crap 
 So I get a shit job and work at it, cat 
 I close my eyes and go through the day to day 
 Nine to five, get a minimum wage and leave all the same 
 Spend a couple bucks on beer, clothes here and there 
 CDs, records, and tapes and that's it, dear 
 Move along down the road and get past 
 I don't need references just a drug test 
 And I pass despite the stems and seeds 
 And I try to make the best of everything that I need 
 So I sit there, don't make any friends 
 Just lift the boxes, load them on the shelves and that's it 
 It seems nice enough, a nice little warehouse 
 I work there all alone - they leave me in the place 
 And they lock the front door, leave me alone 
 They don't trust me, think I'll steal stuff and go 
 But I don't really have any interest in owning this crap 
 I just want my wage and I'll leave it at that 
 So I say thanks as they lock me on in 
 My first day on the job without any friends 
 And they gave me my instructions and my little coat 
 My uniform, my back brace and that's all she wrote 
 So I do my damn job and keep my nose clean 
 Lift box A and take it to rack B 
 I walk around all day counting the seconds 
 Headphones on, singing to the walls just reckless 
 It's funny how you're in a big building alone 
 You start talking to the place like it's someone you know 
 And you tell it all the things that are buzzin' in your brain 
 That been burning in the back of your head all damn day 
 Little secrets and lies, jokes and notes 
 Little observations that you tell no one you know 
 You wouldn't even whisper these things to the mirror 
 Or talk to your dog or couch and make your observations clearer 
 You just keep 'em locked up in your heart 
 'Till you get this big room to tear you apart 
 As you stare at the smooth grey walls 
 You see lines and chips and patterns that form 
 At first it's little geometric shapes 
 Your little notes, scraps, receipts - patterns displayed 
 Like constellations hidden inside the stars 
 Start tracing lines and find faces 
 Then those faces become more detailed 
 Takes on the shapes of males and females 
 You see hands, fingertips, lines and moustaches 
 Little thoughts, dreams and bus passes 
 These little shapes and lines take their own 
 They start to have lives, kids, wives and homes 
 And you look close you see little details 
 The little sins, the little female 
 Thoughts, traits, whispers and dreams 
 And all of a sudden it starts to tear at the seams 
 Because at first when you look into the suburbs 
 You see beautiful faces then get to the curb 
 You see bits of trash and cigarette butts 
 That a mother threw out before her kids got touched 
 By the fact the their mom really smoked 
 For the last thirty years but hid it in the closet, yo 
 Behind the socks, behind the sweaters 
 That's where we hid all our secrets so no one knows better 
 And as I look into the size of the walls 
 And look into the ceiling, there's eyes on the floors 
 I see everything, I see everyone 
 I see the wedding rings, I see the stupid sons 
 I see the little jokes, I see the happy smiles 
 I see the fourth of Julys - the drunk kids and child 
 Heh - I probably shouldn't look this close. 
 The sun, it's behind her face 
 You see the little pink hairs on the side of her cheek there 
 And at first it's romantic and attractive 
 But once you see closer it becomes unattractive 
 I know it's how I think, I know it's how it falls apart 
 But everyone has a place to start 
 A little puzzle piece adds up, get close now 
 I'm laying in the middle of a floor of the warehouse, child 
 I press my floor to the face or I guess it's the other way 
 It doesn't matter why, I can't escape 
 Inside this place, inside this little town 
 I see the arms, the fingers - they start to move around 
 No more Norman Rockwell picturesque 
 It's a whole family, whole frame whole piece of shit 
 Whole little cities start to rip apart to bits 
 And I see it get closer and I'm falling into this 
 I feel my fingers drip as I drag on the surface 
 As I move to the ocean water and trys to make perfect 
 Sense of everything that I know right now 
 I try to pull out, withdraw, get back on track, child 
 I gotta job to do - crates to lift 
 And none of this is seemin' to start to make sense 
 All the little faces and families that I see 
 Must be imagination, I'm tearing at the seams 
 But I stand here on my hands and my knees 
 Lookin' at this whole little civilization I see 
 Buried there inside of the cement 
 As I get closer it starts to rip 
 The families that were once full of cheers are now 
 Full of sad times, alcohol and beer 
 And everyone's got a problem 
 A dirty chair, a bad little secret, a car that won't start, dear 
 The windows are cracked and smudged - it's looking ugly 
 Someone in the neighbourhood let their lawn grow, buddy 
 And they need to trim all the hedges on back 
 To let some sunlight in to expose the facts 
 The truth that we hide behind the doors right 
 Painted bright red with the gold trim tonight 
 It's hidden there inside wrapped presents 
 And I realise there's no escaping and I get in 
 Reach my fingertips into the cement 
 And I bury myself six feet under it 
 The closer that I get, the more that I know 
 The more of the truth and the secrets are shown 
 And every time I get my fingers inside this 
 I get a little far away from what I knew 
 This job, this life, this choice 
 Until one day I've fallen entirely 
 Without a two weeks notice
