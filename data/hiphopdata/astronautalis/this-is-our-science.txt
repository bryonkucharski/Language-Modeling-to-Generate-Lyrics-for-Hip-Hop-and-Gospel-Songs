Touch fire, just to taste the truth 
 Say 
 "You're gonna die young." 
 So are you 
 We chase the lightning, 'cause we need to move 
 This is our science, we've got nothing to prove 
 Tell me where you're going with that knife in your hand, yeah 
 Tell me what you're thinking, boy, what do you got planned? 
 See I don't trust your smile, I know your daddy lets you run wild as the wind 
 I saw you touch her eyelids and I can see you want so clearly to kiss her lips 
 I got friend who walks the strip with a gun on his hip 
 His reason is this: if people caught a glimpse they won't be talking shit 
 And he can rest his heavy fists, he got hands to take teeth 
 He don't need quarters to coax them from lips 
 To you, this is as crazy as it gets 
 To the man with the bruises on hands, it only makes sense, yeah 
 And that's the way that he is 
 (tooth-taker) 
 And that's the way that I live 
 I wasn't born in a boxcar, when I die bury me with crossed arms 
 Underneath the tree up in the back yard 
 Lip that coin in my pocket, yeah, it's a lost art 
 Living what you're giving till it finally stops hearts 
 When us good guys die, we hope those that survive 
 Can spin a solid lie to make us look real hard 
 'Cause we ain't tough, tell em Stef 
 (We just deal with whatever comes up) 
 This is for those who can't take a hint, find a hundred neighbors 
 Ask if they could change their life, then what would they do different 
 Would it be little shifts or would it be some hidden dream 
 From the bitter deep that no one even knows exists 
 To me it makes sense 
 You can waste your time tossing blades of grass at the wind 
 That you could swing fists and if it sinks ships 
 Bury me at sea with my arms crossed and a smile upon my pink lips 
 Tell me this, put up your fingertips 
 If you're living your life exactly the way that you wished, yeah 
 And for the rest of us with our hands on our hips 
 Our work is never done, we are Sisyphus 
 Tell me where you're going with that knife in your hand, yeah 
 Tell me what you're thinking, boy, what do you got planned? 
 I don't trust your smile, I know your daddy lets you run wild, wild as the wind 
 I saw you touch her eyelids and I can see you want so clearly to kiss 
 Kiss, kiss, kiss her lips 
 Touch fire 
 (touch fire) 
 Just to taste the truth 
 (just to taste the truth) 
 Say 
 "You're gonna die young." 
 (you're gonna die young) 
 So are you 
 (so are you) 
 We chase the lightning 
 (we chase the lightning) 
 'Cause we need to move 
 ('cause we need to move) 
 This is our science 
 (this is our science) 
 We've got nothing to prove 
 (we've got nothing to prove) 
 So you touch fire 
 (touch fire) 
 Just to taste the truth 
 (just to taste the truth) 
 Say 
 "You're gonna die young." 
 (you're gonna die young) 
 So are you 
 (so are you) 
 We chase the lightning 
 (we chase the lightning) 
 'Cause we need to move 
 ('cause we need to move) 
 This is our science 
 (this is our science) 
 We've got nothing to prove 
 (we've got nothing to prove)
