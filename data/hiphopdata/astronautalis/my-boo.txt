Girl you should know this 
 I've got you on my mind 
 Your secret admirer 
 And I've been watching you, right 
 At night I dream of you 
 I want to be your baby, lady 
 If your game is strong, give me a call boo 
 If your love is strong, I'll give my all to you 
 Everyday I pray my heart can win 
 Every night I pray I can call you my friend 
 I want you, I need you, to have you, hold you, squeeze you 
 So I'm going out, every weekend 
 Just to see my boo, yeah yeah yeah 
 At night I dream of you 
 I want to be your baby, lady 
 If your game is strong, give me a call boo 
 If your love is strong, I'll give my all to you
