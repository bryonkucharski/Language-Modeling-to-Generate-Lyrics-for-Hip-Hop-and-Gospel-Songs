I'd grown accustomed to the touching 
 The stares and the umbrellas 
 That you held atop my hairs 
 When the subtle rain befell us 
 The acrobat safely steps 
 Above the safety net 
 Faced the lengthy stretch 
 And didn't even seem to sweat the place of the net 
 Whether the taste the grace of the final place 
 Or face the hated misstep 
 He trusts the heart string net 
 Will always be there dressed to catch 
 I make mistakes like the next but I never make regrets 
 I'm not upset I climbed those steps and tried to cross that thing 
 I don't blame you or anyone when we cut strings 
 But I don't look forward to interviewing the new applying sets of arms 
 That will catch me and protect me from the potential bodily harm 
 Catch me and protect me with their wit and charm 
 So I raise the sacred bar and take a charge across that bloody cable 
 Take a step into my quest and try to hold my body stable 
 Take a guess at futures next and wonder when I'm who's the next net to come along and try and save you 
 I'm game to 
 Talking loving and maintaining the friendship 
 But I know that will never fit because it will always be second best 
 Mothers cover their children's eyes 
 Children peek through it 
 And everyone held their breath 
 'Cause I was working without a net 
 And everyone held their breath 
 'Cause I was working without a net 
 And everyone held their breath 
 'Cause I was working without a net 
 And everyone held their breath 
 'Cause I was working without a net 
 And everyone held their breath 
 'Cause I was working without a net
