"Maybe you can tell me what this one means. 
 I have no God damned clue. 
 All right, here we go." 
 It had to be the most singular beautiful thing I'd ever seen in my life 
 A gigantic waterfall, spread out in front of me in the middle of the night 
 The rushing water reflected off the full moon as little stars 
 Blinking, whispering; bright flash then fading on 
 And I look there, down the giant fall the water below 
 And hear the rushing river pounding upon my ear drums 
 Beating slow my heart moves inside the rhythm 
 The rushing water follows a drum as a break-beat 
 Simple, broken but easy to track on son 
 And I drown every fourth count, make my move and now 
 I feel the rushing water beating, pounding, bringing down 
 And as I look back, take an exhalation ready to do my job 
 It kinda looks like my face but the...*stammers* 
 Fuck. 
 Anyway I turn around and look at the line that's formed 
 By the waters edge moving, marching with the water in time 
 And I stand there on a little box at the front of the velvet rope 
 And every person stands on the cliff, shakes my hand and says "I know." 
 And I say "it's good to see you, thank you for coming along" 
 I give 'em a pat on the back a gentle nudge and watch them all fall 
 And one by one they take the dive off the edge of the cliff 
 I watch them line - spread for miles and it never seems to end 
 My shift is endless - I watch the seconds on the clock tick 
 And everyone shakes my hand and says the same shit 
 And I gave them the same gentle smile, nudge, pat on the back 
 And I don't recognize any of these faces but I treat 'em like they're friends 
 And a simple push I watch them slip and fall into the mist 
 And disappear the water's so loud I never hear their bodies hit 
 And the fall must be a thousand miles long 
 The river must be a million knots deep 
 And I'm standing here trying to make this sense see 
 I'm observing myself do this job - I'm not in my body 
 I am floating, looking down from maybe ten feet above me 
 And everyone's treated the same - a simple friendly cordial respect 
 As I pat them on their back and gently nudge them by the neck 
 And watch their little frames fall I float away from me now 
 And trace one persons body as he drifts all the way down 
 And the water rushes, splashes, look inside their face I see a smile displayed 
 Their hearts stopped beating from the over-whelming exaggerating shape 
 Of their life thus far they look back and wonder 
 Why they made this choice - I ask them as they're falling 
 And none of 'em answer, none of 'em hear 
 And none of 'em pay any attention to me, dear 
 Except for me - standing at the top of the cliff pushing 'em near 
 To their end - their death - their final fall and failure 
 And I'm happy that I could help - happy that I could serve them 
 And I don't fuckin' know what this means help me on out 
 It's just a dream - I need more sleep 
 Or a cup of coffee to drag me out of this early morning haze 
 My stupid face and whiskered brow 
 And I'm sitting here trying to make sense of why I'd kill this crowd 
 And why they'd ask me - why they'd volunteer for it 
 To put their buck upon the table and let me push them of a cliff 
 Put their buck upon the table and let me push them of the cliff 
 Put their buck upon the table and let me...I forget.
