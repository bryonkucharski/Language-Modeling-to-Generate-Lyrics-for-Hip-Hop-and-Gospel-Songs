The wind blows and binds our bones together 
 All dressed up in piano wire, love notes, and feathers 
 A slow drift, drag up, lift, we float to heaven 
 Far below our homes glow just like dozing embers 
 I don't care what you thought he would say 
 There's no surprises left except death livin' in this modern age 
 And planes still fly, tug boats float despite their weight 
 Seems like luck would've cashed his chips and walked away 
 You say everything you've been, you taught us to live 
 And if you tell them all the gravity's with protestant kids 
 I could believe it wasn't me, I couldn't murder my friends 
 I 
 So scrape all the change you've collected from dressers and desks 
 And pack your pockets full of food until you stretch seams to split 
 Tie your silken sheets together, hang them fast from the bed, 
 And meet me in the car parked outside of the fence 
 I've got an autoreverse tape deck 
 A bagfull of casettes 
 A pack of cigarettes 
 Let's leave tonight. 
 (Seems like we will never win.) 
 [Unintelligible] to take your rod 
 Brain is just your heart on fire 
 (Whaaaaaaaaat I can't hear this sorry guys someone fix this) 
 Won't you fall asleep with me? 
 Untie your hair then I'll just be 
 The whisper in your ear to shape your dreams 
 To shape your dreams 
 Seems like we will never win. 
 Every second that we second-guess 
 Is like we're taking backwards steps 
 The rain is falling in reverse 
 Your skin is sliding back to bed 
 The sun is rising to the west 
 And the flourishes on your family crest 
 Are sneaking in to rape again and strangle life right out your chest 
 And I'll never know what's best 
 Like the rest is made of lies 
 Perfectly dressed up in disguises, wisdom and sage advice 
 And I can't tell you how to live your life, 
 Hold your hand from here 
 But I can hear them drawing near and I am tired, I am scared.
