Sitting on a futon mat in a squat in Darmstadt 
 Kevin Seconds said to me in passing 
 "Age never meant shit to me. It's all about heart and stupidity." 
 I thought that there's no better way to live 
 We were on the steps in Borno 
 When she bit my lip and choked my throat 
 A hi-ball glass shattered above our heads 
 It seemed her lover listened through the walls 
 While we were kissing, arm in arm 
 I left and spent the night alone instead 
 I couldn't tell you dear, which one whispers in my ear 
 The Devil or St. Andrew, but I know its time to go 
 I'm sure you've got a great theory 
 If I'm hunting something or its haunting me 
 I know there ain't no right way to measure the globe 
 Oh no, oh no 
 I know what you dream of, I dream of it too 
 Of roads that are endless and rooms that are huge 
 Are these visions of heaven or nightmares I'm living? 
 All I know is I'm scared of the truth 
 And if the world could end very soon 
 And all we've accomplished is moot 
 I'll coat the carpet in gasoline 
 Strike our last match and leave 
 Before the whole house is consumed 
 So I'll cover my hand in tattoos 
 I'll kiss any woman that moves 
 There's no Lord to forgive me and physics is tricky 
 So all that I'm left with is you 
 So all that I'm left with is you 
 So all that I'm left with is you 
 I couldn't tell you dear, which one whispers in my ear 
 The Devil or St. Andrew but I know its time to go 
 I'm sure you've got a great theory 
 If I'm hunting something or its haunting me 
 I know there ain't no right way to measure the globe 
 Oh no, oh no, oh no
