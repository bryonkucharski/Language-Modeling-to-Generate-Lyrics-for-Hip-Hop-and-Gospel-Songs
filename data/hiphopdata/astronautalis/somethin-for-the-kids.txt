Me and Fat Joe were riding in the back 
 Of an industrial-strength delivery van 
 I couldn't catch a clear view of the driver's face 
 But I could tell it wasn't a feminine friend 
 The ground plans for battle were all laid 
 We were just taking some time to kick it with grapes and parlay 
 It was just him and me in a van with the gate to gay 
 We taste the grapes and spit the seeds in the street 
 The highway was a scalpel splicing the sands 
 An impressive impression of man's demand for the connection of lands 
 I look back at Joe and laugh 
 I give the grapes a puff and a pass spitting another seed out of the back 
 Joe squints his eyes 
 Lets out a sound that can only be described as a laughter and sigh, combined 
 His pale olive fingers pry another one of the fruits off the vine 
 "We should return here in ten years time." 
 I ask him why 
 "So we can drink the wine from the orchard that is grown from the seeds we alone cast aside." 
 As the sun sunk lower on the sand, dust sprayed from the tires 
 The wind picked up the grains displayed them in spirals 
 And I held the last grape up to eclipse the sun 
 The breeze plucked it from my fingers and the lunch was done 
 Father was an engine driver 
 Grandpa fought the war 
 Hope that I can maybe size up 
 Leave my mark at all 
 Father was an engine driver 
 Grandpa fought the war 
 Hope that I can maybe size up 
 Leave my mark at all 
 Me and Tupac Shakur sat inside a donut shop 
 Sharing a dozen and watching the coffee cool 
 One by one the box slowly emptied 
 From the cakes to the crullers and at last the fancies 
 Pac sighed aloud so I could hear him 
 "Donuts are communism" 
 I asked him why, he said, 
 "Better in theory" 
 We laughed and scratched the sleep from our eyes 
 He said, "This is ridiculous, 12 is too much, half a dozen wastes our time 
 But every time we order twelve thinking we can handle it 
 And every time we end up pissed because we made our stomachs sick" 
 We both laugh a bit and gingerly sip our coffee 
 His fingers scrape the tabletop and he digs in softly 
 And I watch him there, carving, scraping, both sitting in silence 
 As he engraves his name with the word "West side" beside it 
 And underneath the orange veneer of the donut shop gear 
 There's an earthy brown flesh that excavation makes appear 
 And year after year Pac and I return there 
 To the table that he claimed with the matching bench chairs 
 Chug the last of our coffee and stand to leave 
 Wave to the clerk, she says goodbye in Chinese 
 Clutching our sick stomachs we both struggle to speak 
 Shake our heads, split our waists, and say, "See you next week"
