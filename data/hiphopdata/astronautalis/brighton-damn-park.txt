Tell me again about the night you lost it all 
 About the whipping wind [???] 
 Tell me again about the night it fell apart 
 [Down?] in Brighton Park 
 Tell me again and take me firmly by the arm 
 Grip me tight and guide me through the leaves and falling [???] 
 Tell me again about the night you lost it all 
 Down in Brighton Park 
 See ivy winding slyly up the blackened brick of Brighton 
 Damn, it's silently reminding me how tight I grip your tiny hand 
 It's funny finally now that I can loosen hold and understand 
 How quick you slip right back into the comfort of older circumstance 
 It’s those sneaky little holes that spread to show your skin 
 Through broken pants 
 Familiar fingertips that tap the time to history's hopeless dance 
 And everyone's enamoured by the drunken drifters funny tape 
 But no one knows the wash of the wake when the levy breaks 
 And I can't find my way home 
 Find my way home without you 
 She told me everyone's a critic getting caught up in their feelings 
 Newscasters snapping under all the lights and [?] 
 Cameras click and film an up and empty desk and hollow breathing 
 As news becomes the news, tune in at ten p.m. this evening 
 She's such a funny way of getting across the way that she's been thinking 
 Lost her brain's a Basquiat I wanna solve so lets just sit and talk 
 "I'm sorry, darling" she says "You know I'll never play that part" 
 She kisses me goodbye and leaves me by the reservoir 
 And I would never see it then as anything but being scorned 
 As the pine needles drop in perfect patterns on the forest floor 
 But trudging home in Autumn glum, the crunching leaves they sing a song 
 You knew what you'd get into when you wandered off this far 
 Knew what you'd get into when you wandered off this far 
 You knew what you'd get into when you wandered off this far 
 You knew what you'd get into when you wandered off this far 
 You know who you are 
 And I can't find my way home 
 Find my way home without you
