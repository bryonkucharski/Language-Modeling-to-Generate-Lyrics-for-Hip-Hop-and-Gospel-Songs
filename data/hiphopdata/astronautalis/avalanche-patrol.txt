We've got a long way to go 
 Before we finish our patrol 
 Light burns off in the distance 
 No one dares make a sound 
 Scared we might wake the snow 
 Sleeping giants love to listen 
 And tethered together by lines of gold 
 Two of my brothers on patrol 
 Our breathing keeps us in rhythm 
 Well honey I know it's getting cold 
 Eye on the wool cape you have wove 
 I can smell your lavender and lipstick 
 You would never, ask me when I'm coming home 
 You know better, than to wait and watch the snow 
 While the other wives and mothers pray and count their rosaries 
 Not my lover, her lipstick lavender keeps her close to me 
 One, Two 
 One, Two, Three, Four 
 Hold me close as the hour escapes 
 Sunlight running on the mountain's ravenous face 
 The moon came too soon and it'll stay out too late 
 And I can feel that goddamn bell before they ring it 
 Gold heats in your hair promptly at 4 p.m. 
 Then cool to amber as the sun sets again 
 The light through the blinds paints patterns on skin 
 Your head dovetails so nicely on my chest where you laid it 
 When I'm out in the shop, faced to the forge 
 I think of you, my love, as I tend to the coals 
 Smiths with flames high in their eyes are all for show 
 Dreaming, lying to themselves that they've bridled Hades 
 A fire's that's good take patience, control 
 Even bellow breathing this work is painfully slow 
 But you must hold on because you'll taste the reward 
 When that white iron draws out, just like it was painted 
 I know you know this, but I tell you this time 
 Because I need to say it out loud to feel right 
 You listen to me whisper it, my lips graze you ear with every line 
 And you memorize every word, just as I say it 
 Press into me, leave marks in my side 
 And I promise to pull you in until my knuckles go white 
 You're breathing with me now as the sun slips behind the mountain ridge to the west 
 And the day is finished
