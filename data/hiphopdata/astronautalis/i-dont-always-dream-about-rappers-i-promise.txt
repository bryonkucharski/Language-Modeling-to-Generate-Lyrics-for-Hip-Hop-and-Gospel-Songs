It starts and I'm asleep on a pile of leaves freshly green 
 Falling from the trees and I am laying, falling asleep 
 And I look above me as my eyes slowly drift, heavy and close 
 I see the stars explode, sun, moon and everything goes 
 It's almost black and my eyes collapse, my lungs start to soften 
 As my heart beat relaxes and I drift down my thoughts shift 
 All the way into those leaves, the roots and stems and the seeds 
 And all of a sudden like a dozen dreams it shifts on me 
 I am on a date with no feet, everything else is just perfect 
 I am walking around, my jokes are poppin' and everything's working 
 I ask the girls father if I could take her out without bother 
 He lets me borrow the car and says "Bring her back before tomorrow" 
 It's all high fives and drinks, jokes cracked and chivalry 
 I lay my jacket down upon the puddles so she can tread on it see 
 I'd hate to see your pretty feet stuck inside any of the mud 
 Open and closing doors, pulling out her chair and showing love 
 And it's some dinner drinks I think and maybe that's all I get 
 But maybe I can sweet talk her and I can get her in bed 
 And I look into her eyes but her eyes are kinda blurred 
 So I can never see my dream girls face and understood, word 
 But this part of the dream all of a sudden shifts again 
 And I can't really recall exactly what happened to make it connect 
 It's just darkness, blackness I guess this is what you get 
 If you spend all night dreamin' and try to wake up and freestyle about it 
 Because even a bitta booze and no snooze makes you forget all your dreams 
 I'm lucky I have what I have dude so don't complain 
 And matter of fact, if you want something nice 
 Just fuckin' make it up so you can pay for the ten bucks, right? 
 And then it shifts again and I'm buildin' a stage for Sage Francis with friends 
 And I can't make sense of what's going on the stage is long as miles, kid 
 And I don't know where it's gonna end but we keep hammering in nails 
 To build this damn stage upon the show with no failing 
 It's not an option, Sage seems satisfied with what we built 
 I shake my friends hands and I say "That was great, good work for real" 
 And I can't see exactly who they were - I wish it was Fat Joe 
 So I could say I dreamed about him again and rapped in his show 
 And then I shift again I'm not there with friends and stage and Sage 
 I am standing on the sound set of a color film, babe 
 And I am approaching, get the kiss upon the beautiful actress' lips 
 They say cut, camera off - time to change the film I guess 
 But it's the end of the shift, the union's calling time for me to leave 
 I can't stand here inside of this fake set on this fake street 
 The water sprayed across the concrete to make it lookin' nice 
 There's a nice bitta moon and her make-up smudges under the heat of the lights 
 And she looks at me, laughs as she stares into my eyes 
 And I say "Hey" she says "Hey" back and "I'll see you tomorrow, right?" 
 She says "It's all right" maybe one day we go for dinner and drinks 
 And that's what I think but she doesn't say anything - just smiles and blinks 
 And this is it - nothing more and nothing less - a shared moment 
 Standing on this fake sound stage I wish I could lean for a kiss 
 She's beautiful as hell and it's burnin' my damn brain 
 But at the same time, like the rest of the dream I can't make out her damn face 
 A dream girl it seems burnin' right there in front of me 
 And I reach out and touch she disappears and bursts at the seams 
 A bit of smoke, a happy ghost that I wish I could hold and kiss 
 But all of a sudden it's like poof and she's gone into the mist
