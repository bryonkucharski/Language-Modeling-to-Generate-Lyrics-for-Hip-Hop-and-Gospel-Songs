Almighty, all righty 
 What do you say we do some freestylings? That sound good? 
 How many people, how many people have seen me perform before? 
 All right, for the rest of you - they're all gonna give me things to rap about and maybe you should give me somethings to rap about too, and I'll rap about them. 
 Good? Great, grand. 
 Ah, ah, anybody? 
 Yes? 
 Positive K "I got a man, what's your man got to do with me?" 
 What's that? 
 Brush your teeth with diarrhoea? 
 Shit... already. Wednesday already? 
 Yeah what you there, my man? 
 New Smyrna Beach? NSB slut town for life? 
 Fuck yeah, dude. 
 Toothpicks? 
 New Smyrna Beach, brushing your teeth with diarrhoea, Positive K, ah to- and to- toothpicks. 
 Am... and let's go for fi- what you got there, with your hand politely raised? 
 Are you looking for advise? Or do you just wanna hear my story? 
 You're tryin' to write a blog? Okay, cool. 
 On Myspace? You're gonna Myspace her about it? 
 Hah - that's a hot way. That's a hot way to let your girlfriend know. 
 I hope I never get a Myspace that says "Hey Astro, what's up? I'm pregnant." 
 Or just a comment. What if it was a... an ultrasound in the comments section. 
 It's like, it's like a You Tube video and you think "Oh it's just gonna be like a cat runnin' off a bed and hittin' a fuckin' blender", but then it's like, it's like "Hey dad, give me child support". 
 Okay, so it's brushin' your teeth with diarrhoea, toothpicks, ah convincing your girl that you didn't give her a yeast infection, Positive K and what was that last one? New Smyrna Beach - NSB, okay.
