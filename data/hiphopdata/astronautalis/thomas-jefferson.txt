Every song I sing cuts a little bit more 
 You could never connect the copper cast with the mold 
 You could never guess, you could never guess 
 You could never guess where I come from, no 
 Every mile I drive, further down this road 
 Tears a little more off of my bones 
 And you could never guess, you could never guess 
 You could never guess where I come from, no 
 The first thing they was taught, was how to load and lock 
 Take that aim and shot, embrace the pain of shoulder blade taking stock 
 Watch em drop, pull the bolt back, load another up till the clip goes "pop" 
 Till you sweep your block, and you can hear a pin drop 
 In a place that's more comfortable with "POP! POP! POP! POP!" 
 The first thing they learned, was how to plant that carbine in the earth 
 Prop that helmet on the stock, hang them dog tags from the lock 
 Say your prayers and mark the spot 
 Where the body's interred then turn, taciturn 
 And talk that walk, taste that salt 
 Sprinkle a little bit of lye in the earth, don't cry when it hurts 
 'Cause you ain't done yet son, spill a little bit more blood 
 Everybody knows what comes from the warm wet red mud 
 Best I believe, when you fall to your knees 
 You're gonna cry, you'll pray for peace 
 And they gonna plant them seeds of the winter wheat 
 And the Georgia peach watered up with your red rum 
 Every song I sing cuts a little bit more 
 You could never connect the copper cast with the mold 
 You could never guess, you could never guess 
 You could never guess where I come from, no 
 Every mile I drive, further down this road 
 Tears a little more off of my bones 
 And you could never guess, you could never guess 
 You could never guess where I come from, no 
 I know he would've loved this, but he had to die to give it 
 I melted down his musket, turned it to a tool 
 Tilling like a fool to see where his blood went 
 See if I can grow something beautiful above it 
 Standing guard above my garden till the seeds take root 
 Taking shade under the trees with the sweet grapefruit 
 I'll take my yield and his old boots till the leaves shake loose 
 I will die in these fields, but my seeds will move 
 The ox and yoke know every note I hum 
 Written in the grass by the midday sun 
 The lamp lit ahead of me with the earth between my feet 
 I'll sing a song into the breeze, let it fold the wheat 
 Every song I sing cuts a little bit more 
 You could never connect the copper cast with the mold 
 You could never guess, you could never guess 
 You could never guess where I come from, no 
 Every mile I drive, further down this road 
 Tears a little more off of my bones 
 And you could never guess, you could never guess 
 You could never guess where I come from, no 
 Every song I sing cuts a little bit more 
 You could never connect the copper cast with the mold 
 You could never guess, you could never guess 
 You could never guess where I come from, no 
 Every mile I drive, further down this road 
 Tears a little more off of my bones 
 And you could never guess, you could never guess 
 You could never guess where I come from, no
