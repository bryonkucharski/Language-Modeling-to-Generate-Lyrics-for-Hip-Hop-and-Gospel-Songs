I climbed this hill to build you up 
 They say no man is an island 
 With wood and rocks I built this hut 
 And we ate all our meals inside it 
 If poor truth be our only love 
 Then where will lies find me 
 For wood and rocks are not enough 
 Without you nothing can build it up 
 No, no 
 No expectations 
 No, no 
 No expectations 
 No, no 
 No expectations 
 No, no 
 No expectations 
 Seventeen summers since the nation died in my clutch 
 And she swore I can outrun your guidance and love 
 Peace is peace and blood is blood 
 Tis rare the twain shall meet just once 
 The world has wisdom but never enough 
 I'm a dull image of my father's son 
 My weak hands can't mend our hearts 
 And yours can tear the world apart 
 God give me the strength to live as I please 
 With the windows open, and my face in the breeze 
 Whither thou may go 
 I will follow
