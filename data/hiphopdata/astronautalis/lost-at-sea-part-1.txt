It's just a little further baby gotta get what she wants... Gotta drown it out. 
 It's just a little further baby gotta get what she needs... Gotta build it up. 
 The famous waves escaping all my lame attempts to drag them in and ride to safety. Hate me. This is a coronation decorate me in your favorite, sinking, maybe, save me. Save me. Save me. 
 It's just a little further baby gotta get what she wants... We're all lost at sea. 
 It's just a little logic we're all crazy for it... My god the stars are falling in. 
 He's just a little lazy we all have walked it lady... Slipped off and falling in. 
 It's such a lovely evening baby wants to go for a walk... It's easy friend.
