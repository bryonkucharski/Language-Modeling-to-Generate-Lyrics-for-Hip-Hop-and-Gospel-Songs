Let's take the long way home 
 Break each other's bones 
 What your daddy don't know 
 Won't put no pox on his soul, you know 
 You haul a heavy load 
 Draped in your mama's gold 
 Think of how good you'd look 
 If you were a ghost 
 Shorty swing my way 
 Lock the fucking deadbolt, draw the shades 
 Got fired on a Friday 
 Back on the block the same damn day 
 I know we got problems, problems 
 I used to be real good at making 'em fade 
 But we run out of options, options 
 Fuck I look like bagging groceries at the pick n save 
 If this a different age 
 And you and I had different names 
 We probably wouldn't sweat a single thing 
 But hey 
 I know you hate this game 
 You probably plot your great escape 
 To run back to your mama and your daddy 
 But dang 
 It ain't so simple babe 
 You handcuffed to my wrist again 
 You wanna keep your head afloat you swim 
 Or sink 
 You gettin' riches ain't you 
 Remember when we kids, it's strange 
 It all just seems so goddamn far away 
 From today, hey 
 Let's take the long way home 
 Break each other's bones 
 What your daddy don't know 
 Won't put no pox on his soul, you know 
 You haul a heavy load 
 Draped in your mama's gold 
 Think of how good you'd look 
 If you were a ghost 
 A ghost 
 A ghost 
 How good you'd look if you were a ghost 
 It's like that rush that you get 
 When you jump off high shit 
 When the drugs hit your lips 
 Or have unprotected sex 
 We all so damn scared 
 That we too close to death 
 We'll do anything we can 
 To cheat the Devil for a breath 
 Or feel that life in your chest 
 Yeah, that pain gives you strength 
 So you run till you collapse 
 Chasing a fox that you can't catch 
 And we like it like that 
 Yeah, don't you like it like that? 
 Smiling like Cheshire cat 
 You trace your nail marks in my back 
 Intoxicated by that 
 Dangerous track 
 There's something oddly comforting about 
 Standing next to forest of black 
 Secretly hoping it'll engulf you 
 And you'll never look back 
 To that person that you were 
 Before you walked in my path, eh 
 Let's take the long way home 
 Break each other's bones 
 What your daddy don't know 
 Won't put no pox on his soul, you know 
 You haul a heavy load 
 Draped in your mama's gold 
 Think of how good you'd look 
 If you were a ghost 
 A ghost 
 A ghost 
 How good you'd look if you were a ghost
