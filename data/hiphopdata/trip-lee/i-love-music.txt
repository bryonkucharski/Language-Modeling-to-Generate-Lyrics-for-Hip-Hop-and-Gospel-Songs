Hey I came up in a crib where music played non-stop 
 From the night till the day we're in them same loud spots 
 Before I heard o' Nas and Jay I would say my pops 
 He used to play all my saints and marvin gaye up top 
 Some have to wait Isley brothers heard the way they rock 
 Earth Wind and fire man you can't say that they not hot 
 So I take from my dad more than the name I got 
 But my love for music I would gladly take my lot 
 I remember rockin' out some mj always 
 Had me moon walkin' in my socks in the halways 
 Playin' tapes in my walkman all day 
 The good days lil will is what they call me 
 And everything I loved I had to try to do it 
 I tried to play some sports but I fell in love with music 
 Plus that love stayed and that love grew deeper 
 It wasn't goin' nowhere either 
 I love to hear the kick hit, love to hear the snare pop, love to hear them hi-hats play 
 I love music much more than I can say, I love music I was just designed that way 
 I love to hear the violin, love to hear the keystroke, love to hear trumpet play 
 Thank God for music, ain't much more that I can say, thank God for music, thank God for music 
 Eh, I discovered hip hop and I was never the same 
 I got my first CD still remember the name 
 Started to bump Jay-Z he was ahead of the game 
 Me and my boys bumped it all the time it's regular thangs 
 I remember middle school we used to write them rhymes 
 Shout out to K, Rock and Nick we used to write them lines 
 Was talkin' foolishness I used to swipe dem dimes 
 I used to look back at mine like "I was tight this time" 
 I got serious about it tryna make that heat 
 Recordin in my room and Leak he used to make me beats 
 When times is hard, my first love had made things sweet 
 I had dreams of goin' platinum tryna take things deep 
 But then a light came on, I changed my mind to anon 
 The trick was tryna find a way to take the whole game on 
 I saw that it was bigger than just tryna put my name on (why?) 
 Jesus is supreme and that's what I wanna display homes 
 I love to hear the kick hit, love to hear the snare pop, love to hear them hi-hats play 
 I love music much more than I can say, I love music I was just designed that way 
 I love to hear the violin, love to hear the keystroke, love to hear trumpet play 
 Thank God for music, ain't much more that I can say, thank God for music, thank God for music 
 Back in the day when I was young I went from rich 'n' to poor 
 Fell in love with music poppin' 'n' breakin on floors 
 Figured I would bust some flows instead of breakin my bones 
 Thinkin' like I moved the crowd in my mirrors at home 
 Within the cipher zone I found that I could hold my own 
 Had dreams of blazin' up the joint like cheech and chong 
 I'ma be a rap star when I grow up 
 Light a match to my gods head I'ma blow up 
 If they don't recognize my skills joker so what 
 They don't know talent when they see it they don't know us 
 But I met the One who did His name was Jehovah 
 Took me off of death row made a no limit soldier 
 Still love music just as much as the next man 
 I just use it now to save jokers from they death jam 
 Theirs glories in the whistle blow, 
 Toe tap, hand clap, heart beat 
 You did your thing tip off my high hat 
 I love to hear the kick hit, love to hear the snare pop, love to hear them hi-hats play 
 I love music much more than I can say, I love music I was just designed that way 
 I love to hear the violin, love to hear the keystroke, love to hear trumpet play 
 Thank God for music, ain't much more that I can say, thank God for music, thank God for music
