Hey I still recall the day the doctor told me that I was sick 
 And my mind keeps going back it was a trip 
 Look I was thinkin' He ain't know the facts 
 Probably cause my heart couldn't get a hold of that 
 He said that I was terminal and that it spread quick 
 And my whole body was infected I'm desperate 
 My minds racing at this point I wanna exit 
 Cause all His tests suggested I be dead quick 
 But honestly man I really shoulda seen the signs 
 I was blind no I couldn't read in between the lines 
 I was numb so I couldn't feel my fever climb 
 But my whole system was foul (fowl) like comedic lines 
 No way to treat it fine 
 I staggered out like I was drinkin' wine 
 I wasn't even tryna think about of my plans for the evenin time 
 All I could think was I was weak and dyin' 
 I was reminded of the life that I would leave behind 
 And so 
 I know it's headed for me soon and I'm terrified 
 I'm afraid of what's coming and I'm scared to die 
 But it ain't lookin' good for me, now it ain't lookin' good for me 
 I know it's headed for me soon and I'm terrified 
 I'm afraid of what's coming and I'm scared to die 
 But it ain't lookin' good for me, now it ain't lookin' good for me 
 Now I got home and it hit me in the worst way 
 I've been sick with this disease since my birthday 
 I was ridden with symptoms since my first day 
 Head to toe my whole system in the worst state 
 I was mentally ill, I was futilely mind 
 Darkened in my understanding was a student of crime 
 Havin' eyes couldn't see 'cause I was truthfully blind 
 Havin' ears couldn't hear but couldn't do any signs 
 Throat was an open grave, tongue used for the lies 
 Snake venom under lips which I would use to divide 
 Had chips on my shoulders was wounded aside 
 Both my lungs collapsed inhalin 2nd hand pride 
 Below the waist was just more of the same 
 Feet swift to shed blood or somethin' more was to gain 
 Man it's bad blood simply pourin through my veins 
 Can't ignore it anymore, ain't the story the same, I was in pain so 
 I know it's headed for me soon and I'm terrified 
 I'm afraid of what's coming and I'm scared to die 
 But it ain't lookin' good for me, now it ain't lookin' good for me 
 I know it's headed for me soon and I'm terrified 
 I'm afraid of what's coming and I'm scared to die 
 But it ain't lookin' good for me, now it ain't lookin' good for me 
 My whole life been exposed as dark 
 My disease had my deeds hittin off the mark 
 But I had loved my illness even from the start 
 Look everything was a symptom of my broken heart 
 It pumped corruption to every single part of me 
 Its pumped death and deception through arteries 
 My direction was set to invest in reflect 'n' deception 
 Threat 'n' my best 'n' my death wasn't far from me 
 'Cause I tried to beat the symptoms now 
 It wouldn't matter cause my heart would keep me livin' foul 
 I was helpless and hopeless it's endin now 
 Unless I get a new heart well this is how 
 I heard that there were others with the same plight 
 But there was One begotten Son who can save life 
 And His heart was so perfect He gave life 
 My heart of stones been exchanged I've been changed right? 
 I know it's headed for me soon and I'm terrified 
 I'm afraid of what's coming and I'm scared to die 
 But it ain't lookin' good for me now it ain't lookin' good for me 
 I was told that God's standard is so high. My broken heart kept me from meetin His standard, so I just kept fallin' short over and over and overagain. And there was really nothing I could do, it was not looking good for me. I guess my question for you is, since God's standard is perfection and none of us meet it, how do you plan on getting by? I know how I do, and to be honest I ain't worried about a thang.
