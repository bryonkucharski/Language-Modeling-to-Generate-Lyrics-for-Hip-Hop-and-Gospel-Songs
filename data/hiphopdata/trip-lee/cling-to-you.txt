Lord, I'd like to start by saying I can hate where I'm at 
 When this life is hard and situations take me aback 
 The fight is hard and I can hardly face it in fact 
 In life it's hard to get up like a bar with weights that's attached 
 It really seems the situations that I'm facing is wack 
 I been awakened but now I'm feeling forsaken and trapped 
 With no hope and I'm broken open for Satan to trap 
 I been bothered since You Father put this weight on my back 
 So please erase it's wack, 'cause when this pain it attacks 
 My weakness is at it's peak and I'm feeling strained and I lack 
 The trust in You I struggle through the ways that I should come to You 
 Lord, what am I gonna do? It's true this pain it distracts 
 But I see my only hope when my backs on the ropes 
 Is in You so I read through the facts that You wrote 
 The pain may fade away, but if that's my only hope 
 Then You don't get the glory alone not even close 
 Lord, it may get better but it may not 
 So when I pray God, I pray I 
 Would trust You whether or not the pain stops 
 So when the the pain falls, coming down like rain drops 
 I just gotta cling to You 
 Heavenly Father, in Your Word You say we can build 
 Because of Jesus and the blood that He graciously spilled 
 Lord, I thank You for real, cause my Dad's always there 
 I can cast all my cares plus the weight that I feel 
 My situation is ill, I ain't asking to be making a mill 
 But is all my money for paying my bills? 
 It gets crazier still, my soul's on dangerous hills 
 A target for the world, flesh, and Satan aiming to kill 
 While the wicked who be hating your will 
 Sit by the lake as they chill, taking in sensational thrills 
 Lord, Your Son I admire, He's the one I desire 
 I'll run through the fire if You say it's Your will 
 But at times it's hard to hear You, the world doesn't fear You 
 Lord, give me a clear view Your face is concealed 
 Help me to be patient until Your grace is revealed 
 And in the mean time, between time, be praising You still 
 Lord, it may get better but it may not 
 So when I pray God, I pray I 
 Would trust You whether or not the pain stops 
 So when the the pain falls, coming down like rain drops 
 I just gotta cling to You 
 Lord, You know I'm hoping that my situation will switch 
 That You'll show me You're amazing by erasing it quick 
 But I've noticed that my hope was in You changing it quick 
 Instead of knowing You're enough Lord I was chasing Your gifts 
 But then I opened up Your text and looked at David and them 
 Their situations was grim, but it ain't change them within 
 They prayed You'd take it away but sought Your face in the end 
 And found comfort in Your justice and the grace You extend 
 So in this life full of strife if my days get grayer 
 I'm content with the fact that You'll stay my Savior 
 No change in my game, man, it ain't no greater 
 Comfort than what's found in You that's so major 
 So in this life full of strife if my days get grayer 
 I'm content with the fact that You'll stay my Savior 
 No change in my game, man, it ain't no greater 
 Comfort than what's found in You that's so major
