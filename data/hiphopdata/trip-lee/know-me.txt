I wanna introduce y'all to a friend of mine 
 A lot of y'all don't know him 
 But maybe you'll understand if he talks to you 
 Good evening, it's me, yeah it sounds so strange 
 May not know me but I am a household name 
 Since I came I ain't never been without no fame 
 Always grab attention, mayne without no strain 
 Yeah you heard of me, maybe I slipped out your brain 
 Some they really love me, no doubt, no vain 
 Others think I'm wack like "he sounds so lame" 
 Some are somewhere in the middle like when altos sing 
 But yup, you might find me fresh of the presses 
 Dressed in the best leather, cat's better reckon 
 Knives open eyes, I'm direct with a message 
 Incapable of lies, come correct when I step in 
 Known to change lives, yeah my rep is impressive 
 Some don't really get me 'cause I am hard to see 
 I've split up some families, I'm known to cause wreckage 
 Some don't really get me, they say I'm hard to read 
 Know me 
 You know me, you know ... 
 Know me 
 You know me, you know ... 
 Aye, I'm so old school but I'm relevant to new 
 In a league of my own, known for tellin' them the truth 
 I know fakes that oppose, but I'm tellin' 'em to move 
 'Cause they ain't on my level like my elevator moved 
 Uh-uh, they try to hang and compete with what I bring 
 But it just ain't the same, they miss, they playin' games 
 I got truth that they missin', 'bout what they can obtain 
 They fakes, they not real, one day they will be ashamed 
 No challenges can harm me, I'm battling the storm 
 I know folks that got my quotes tatted on they arms 
 But they missin' the point from Atlanta to the Bronx 
 If they lives don't change and their patterns ain't informed 
 I'll give you data, speak on matters that'll form 
 The way you see the world, from your calories to porn 
 If you hear me but never change, better be alarmed 
 I need doers, not hearers that's the norm, let's go 
 Know me 
 You know me, you know ... 
 Know me 
 You know me, you know ... 
 Hey throughout my lifetime, I done seen a lot of folks 
 Been around the world, but ain't seen a lot of hope 
 And I came to help if they believed in what I spoke 
 Most ain't listen very well, they just read a lot of quotes 
 Been used and abused by most that find me 
 Some dudes in them pews, please don't remind me 
 The views that they choose really don't define me 
 Look, I just wanna be understood 
 Hey, I'm a great storyteller and a beast of a poet 
 A master historian, esteemed by the coldest 
 And all of this centered around he who they notice 
 But didn't recognize as the King who controls it 
 The most high up, and I'm so inspired 
 By a move created everything, don't try him 
 I take it he's a lover plus a known fighter 
 But I can't take credit 'cause I got a ghostwriter 
 You ain't caught it yet? 
 I'm talkin' about the Word 
 Yeah, and if you don't know him you need to 
 Study his ways and they will keep you from evil 
 Word
