Yes sir, everyday got to jump in the text 
 'Cause He's the better way, yeah, the Son is the best 
 That trash: I'll pass on the pump and the vest 
 Got the sword of the Spirit, I run to the text 
 I run to the best answer for every question 
 It's got every teaching, every lesson, 
 That we could ever need for reppin' 
 Jesus, yes sir, He's a blessing 
 We got to read His Holy Word 
 To deny this bible's so absurd 
 I deny my pride, and God is first 
 So I got to dive inside His Word 
 What other way could we know how to live this thing? 
 It's inspired by the Spirit, man 
 So listen man, the very Word of God is in the scriptures, man 
 We got to see its God breathed, and it's His will for all creeds, 
 All races, all nations, Genesis to Revelation 
 So get up in it if you want to know 
 His will revealed through the Son and more 
 It's real, but you'll feel dumb to go 
 Without it as a Saint it will stunt your growth 
 But bro you supposed to grow much closer 
 To Jehovah bro He wrote you 
 All we need to grow as soldiers 
 And show other folks, we 'posed to 
 So grab your pen, pencil, highlighter, and your commentary 
 And dig deep in the scriptures, Jesus with us He can carry 
 Bible, check; spiral, check, highlighter check 
 Now dig (dig in it), dig (dig in it) 
 You want to know Him? Got to dig (dig) dig (in) 
 You want to know Him? Got to dig (dig) dig (in) 
 Where all my cats who know the bible's solid? 
 Grinding off in bible college, getting it in with Psalms and Prophets 
 Becoming urban bible scholars 
 Yearning, learning all the knowledge 
 Then putting it to use now that you got it 
 We need it, must read it, Jesus He is pleased with solid doctrine 
 Where all my cats who get up in the Word and love it? 
 Not just when they be up in the church in public 
 But in private they dive in, it be on they mind, they be thinking of it 
 We need that, read that, see that Jesus gets the glory He deserves 
 And the only way we can know His ways is if we stay up in His Word 
 He inspired it through writers they was carried along 
 The Spirit inspired the bible so all its merit is strong 
 Yes sir He breathed it Theopneustos 
 So if you trying to move close 
 Then get it, live it, give it to some faithful men that you know 
 Hope your passion is real passionate 
 Everybody in the faith got to master this 
 He ain't just write the Bible for the Pastor kid 
 So how we all gon' slack with it? 
 We got to get up in it heavy and be ready to live it out 
 This is for my Christians in it trying to figure scripture out 
 It may seem hard to understand at times 
 But depend on the Lord He handed down 
 Scriptures pointing to Himself don't just try to stack knowledge to cram in your mind 
 It ain't about knowledge you stack or all the doctrine you pack 
 Inside your mind man God's design was not just for you to find the facts 
 Don't be like them Pharisees, man they knew the scripture good 
 But from the looks of things apparently they ain't know all that they should 
 The Jews was searching the scriptures looking for life, the eternal kind 
 But for certain they was missing Christ John 5, verse 39 
 But don't get twisted man they intentions was great 
 But they was missing the faith, they had it twisted mistake 
 So get up in them right, they a witness of the Christ 
 Search it learn it then stick it in your life 
 Listen to the Christ's works and person 
 And perfect is a description of Him right? 
 Then pass it along to some faithful dudes 
 So cats will get strong and convey the truth 
 To others we love to discover truth and pass to our other brothers 
 Did I st-stutter? We got to follow Christ and His Father and the Spirit inside us guides us in the Word that's the model
