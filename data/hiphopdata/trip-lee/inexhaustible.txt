Hey, you crazy if you think you can grasp 
 The eternal ruler who is first and is last 
 Reigns in the present, and he reigned in the past 
 Who is perfect and has none to learn in a class 
 See a lot of dudes I don't think they get it 
 Got a picture in our brain but the King can't fit it 
 Yeah we got a lil' box but the King ain't in it 
 He's way too complex, don't get this thing twisted 
 I could learn 'bout him who's on the throne 
 But like Badu he goes on and on 
 I could spit a million rhymes till the song is long 
 But still not have enough bars like a broken phone 
 To tell all about the God of Romans known 
 Through the Scriptures, that picture should blow your dome 
 He's amazing behold Him, appraise Him He's golden 
 Inexhaustible, I'm amazed just to know him 
 Hey what you know about this God? 
 He's way too great homie, I can't grasp him 
 Hey what you know about this God? 
 He's too complex, my mind can't fathom 
 What you know about this God? 
 He's amazing, behold him, appraise him, he's golden 
 Hey what you know about this God? 
 He's inexhaustible, I'm amazed just to know him 
 For instance I just can't get this, he 
 Is one but eternally exists in three 
 That's crazy, our minds can't grip this we 
 Need to realize we men so our picture's weak 
 Just try to understand how he came as a man 
 But remained I Am, all things in his hand 
 Say what? The King was slain as the lamb 
 When he came to the land that he made with his hands 
 Say what? Just try to make your brain understand 
 He's so big, man's like a grain in the sand 
 That picture's too big for a frame but my plan is to grow 
 I pray my picture of the King will expand 
 I could study forever and read all day 
 But still wouldn't understand the King all the way 
 I got a long way to go, but I'm pleased to say 
 I get to live my whole life just to seek his face 
 Hey it's not enough words in my speech to proclaim His greatness 
 Not in the whole English language 
 To exhaust this King, his past is blameless 
 I won't stop reppin' till His name is famous 
 Among all nations, he still prevails 
 Praise the Lord that he chose to reveal himself 
 When he could have just chilled and concealed himself 
 Praise the Lord that he chose to reveal himself 
 Now we can share in enjoyment, see more and more 
 The glory, the beauty of the Lord of Lords 
 Through Creation, or Scripture's the door to more 
 Can't get it all on this Earth, there's more in store 
 When we get to eternity, it'll be better 
 We get to see more of the Lord forever 
 A million years later, the joy is the same 
 Seeing still more and exalting his name
