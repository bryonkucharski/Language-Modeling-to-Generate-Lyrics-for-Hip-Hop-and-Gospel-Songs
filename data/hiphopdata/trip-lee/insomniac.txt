(Can I begin? Yes) 
 Gawvi, get 'em 
 Verse 1 - Trip Lee: 
 Hey Mineo, let's go (yeah) 
 I'm going in today 
 This my only shot 
 My life could end today 
 Yeah my heart stop 
 If I go out tonight I'm going out on top 
 I give it all this life ain't all I got 
 Yessir now wait a minute bruh 
 I see y'all rocking with your hands high 
 Waiting for that beat to take off, 808's on standby 
 When I'm breathing bangers I say statements that I stand by 
 The ground gon shake when that beat drop, landslide 
 Please let me off my leash 
 I feel it, I feel it, I'm feeling too good 
 Like I'm a beast 
 Like a gorilla who's real in the hood 
 So I'm going on and on 
 I'll be resting when I'm gone 
 Rise and grind is what I'm on 
 Bruh that's why I wrote the song 
 Tonight I'm going off like 
 My life span just lasts all night 
 If I don't wake up in the morning, bruh I'm gon be all right 
 Throw caution to the wind 
 Let go we bout to go in 
 No slowing down, we gon win 
 No slowing down, we know him 
 Brag 
 Pre-hook: 
 Tonight I'll risk it all to follow 
 And live like my life's over tomorrow 
 We love it 
 We go hard all week 
 Till it's over ain't no sleep 'cause we getting it getting it getting it 
 Insomniac 
 We be getting it getting it 
 (x5) 
 Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh... Insomniac [x2] 
 Insomnia -ay (gettin' it, gettin' it, gettin' it) [x2] 
 Bridge - Trip Lee:

 No slowing down we gon' win 
 No slowing down we gon' win 
 Throw caution to the wind 
 Let go we bout to go in

 Verse 2 - Andy Mineo: 
 Okay okay okay I get it 
 What's the point of playing the game if you don't win it 
 I ain't never spit a sweet sixteen 
 I call that a gift so you know I gotta bring it 
 Y'all live like minutes is infinite 
 If time isn't money then why you tripping to spend it 
 Finally found a girl that ain't in her phone all the time so you know I had to ring it 
 Oh my oh god 
 That ain't common no girl that's impressive 
 I'm trying to fight for the cause 
 Y'all wanna fight in my comment section 
 I don't get it dawg, like dead beat dads I don't get involved 
 They said I'd never be nothing but I think I still turned out awesome 
 I ain't into talking I just get it done 
 They wanna get a job or wanna get a gun? 
 They want to get a blunt and get burnt out like me in the sun 
 Wow, I think they on to us 
 Don't sleep mow that's insomnia 
 Y'all worried bout when them Jordans drop 
 But you ain't worried bout what your body does? 
 Dang
