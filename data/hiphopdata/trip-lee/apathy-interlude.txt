Sometimes I'm hurtin' and I'm burdened when I'm gazin' inside 
 'Cause I ain't concerned with other persons, the foundation is pride 
 Feel like a fake and a lie 
 It's like my comforts of my Lord 'cause I be raisin' him high 
 Until the day that I die, I surely struggle with this apathy invading 
 I try to front, like I'm Mr. Compassionate my ratings are high 
 And meanwhile these folks is hurtin' every place, I should cry 
 But I lose sight like bullets grazin' my eyes, what should I do now? 
 When I drive through my city, and I see these folks hurtin' 
 Yeah, I'm certain that I care till I'm home and close the curtains 
 It's like they ain't even there, man my heart is so disturbin' 
 I should be prayin' for 'em, findin' ways that I can serve 'em 
 The bottom line, Lord I'm praying I be on the grind 
 Pursuing service, never out of sight, out of mind 
 Preaching truth and trying to model my Lord till he's back and them knees hit the floor 
 I'm waitin'!
