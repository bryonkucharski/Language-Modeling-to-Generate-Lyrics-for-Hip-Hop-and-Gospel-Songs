Set the scene, in the beginning was God 
 He was holy, glorious and He was wise 
 If anyone tries, to question His power 
 Tell them cowards, you really don't buy it 
 He's really so fly, He don't need no assistance 
 He made everything spoke it into existence 
 Creation listened, with no resistance 
 What kinda powerful God is this? 
 I'm tripping sometimes I stop and just gaze 
 I'm so amazed that He made this in 6 days 
 Made land, made man, but man made a mistake 
 Men ate fruit now we all in a sin state 
 But don't think He's no match for the serpent He 
 Smashes His adversaries, laughs at adversity 
 They plan, they scam, but they ain't got a good fate 
 The seed of the woman will smash on the serpent's seed 
 Time goes, guys grow mo and mo sin filled 
 God grows, tired though, He's hatred for their sin builds 
 Because they lacked great faith and love 
 God showed that He reigned with a flood 
 He showed His hatred for sin that sits in mens hearts 
 And the grace He extends to men on His ark 
 He's amazing man, His great works are a testimony to His person 
 And I'm so blessed He knows me 
 Come close, tell me what do you see? 
 It's God and that's something to see 
 You wanna know who the boss is? 
 Flip through His narrative, switch through His character 
 Come close, tell me what do you see? 
 It's God and that's something to see 
 You wanna know who the boss is? 
 Take a look at His works you can see ID 
 Aye Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph in the hands of Yahweh how they showed us 
 How raw our God is never say no 
 Ask Pharaoh let go my people like ego 
 They know who so parted the Red Seas 
 Plans to redeem through Abraham's seed 
 Here comes another parting through the Jordan waters 
 God is such an artist should be askin' for His autograph 
 This ain't the half my brother 
 That God reveals like pealing the covers 
 Back His attributes and acts 
 That we will see when we go in OT 
 But-what I ain't talkin' bout overtime 
 The Old Testament see the plagues and pestilence 
 That reveals how holy God is 
 So much so that even armies had to bow down 
 Look at Jericho the walls had to let 'em go 
 Who can tell Him no dawg betta let 'em know who can stay afloat when God got the levees broke 
 See for His glory 
 Tt will get glory 
 Yet at the same time the same God of Jacob 
 The same God of Joseph and Caleb 
 Can take a sinner man and make 'em a nation 
 Make laws just to show off His power and patients 
 Come close, tell me what do you see? 
 It's God and that's something to see

 Let the Gospels introduce you to the Lamb and the light 
 In Revelation He returns as the Lion with the might 
 He runs the urban jungle crushed my burden to the law 
 Took a bite out of sin/ Got death in His claw 
 He demonstrates his power over death, sickness 
 Over Nature, over evil over time and distance 
 All power is in his hand, when they thought he was ruined 
 But he rose from the grave like \"How you doing\" 
 He established the church and working hard like adrenaline 
 But Satan and the world they want to pump us with Ritalin 
 Gotta keep running whether in your bapes or timberland 
 Perseverance of the saints, baby there is no giving in 
 Now the Holy Spirit provides gifts for the church 
 So we can build one another and complete his works 
 What does this say about Jehovah, He so consistent 
 Man falls man repents man is freed from his prison 
 All by His power, through His mercy and His grace 
 So man will stop worshiping self and seek his face 
 We live the great commandment then do the great commission 
 So we see 20/20, continue the family business 
 Come close, tell me what do you see? 
 It's God and that's something to see
