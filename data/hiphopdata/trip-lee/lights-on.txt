Oh oh, the light 
 We don't know where we going 
 Oh oh, the light 
 Look around it's all dark, all black everything 
 Like the million man march, but I'm talking bout everything 
 Dark hearts, dark souls 
 Dark minds writing dark flows 
 Can I get a little light though? 
 Is that something I can fight for? 
 Hey we so blind we don't know 
 On that highway we go 
 Go full speed ahead, flying but we low 
 But we don't know just what he got in store, no more falling for the okie doke 
 Nope, he can give us sight for things we never saw before 
 Till that light get to glowing, we don't know where we going 
 But it ain't no google map for life, and it's like our headlights are broken 
 Proof: we flashing, passing on some treasure that's golden 
 For some nickel and copper, trying to get glory that's stolen 
 And reaping what we sowing 
 Hey we all got dreams, this is mine 
 I'm praying that he'll flip that switch and shine, kids are blind 
 We know you got it, Lord we know you got it 
 Only you can take us higher, you the pilot 
 Lights please 
 Oh oh, the light 
 Lights Please! 
 We don't know where we going 
 We so far from our home 
 We don't know where we going 
 Blackout, no power's on 
 We don't know where we going 
 My homies gone, they need you to show them so turn them lights on 
 We don't know where we going 
 We so far from our home 
 We don't know where we going 
 Blackout, no power's on 
 We don't know where we going 
 Until we go where living water is flowing so turn them lights on 
 I was walking alone down a dark alley wish I coulda known 
 I was locked in a box with blinders blocking my sight of the throne 
 Was plotting on others instead of relying on God I was gone 
 But my mind it was blown, when He shined that light in my home 
 Taking off sleep mask, full speed with the seats back 
 Now I can drive head lights on, that steep cliff I see that 
 Detour, gotta turn around, young lady gotta turn her down 
 180, ain't perfect now, but I press on and I get stronger 
 Dear Lord, our people lost you see the shooting, killing 
 Who let lucifer loose? We all are duped and willing 
 And he ain't through concealing, glory from humans 
 We doomed to be in that tomb and walking to our execution 
 Man, thank you for dragging me out that dark room 
 Your truth pierced through my heart like harpoons, no cartoon 
 It's a blackout, no light just black out 
 Please give them grace, I know you got more light to pass out 
 So can you turn the lights on? 
 Can you turn the lights on for me? 
 (It's so far from home)
