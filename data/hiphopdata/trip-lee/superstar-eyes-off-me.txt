Oh yeah they talk a lot, they say they that they walk it out, they say they this 
 They making chips, their cake's legit, don't baller block or call the cops 
 They think they something, better not say they ain't or that they fake or fronting 
 Otherwise their duns wills ride with guns inside their range or something 
 That's what all they songs about, they long for wrong they all about 
 How they the stuff and they discuss how they all go that baller route 
 But me I take that smaller route, them ballers I'm gon' call them out 
 And say to dudes the King is true, so that's what I'm gon' talk about 
 Look I ain't got no cocky flows bout dollars copped when rocking shows 
 Or girls that pop and drop it low, or glocks that I'm gon' lock and load 
 It's not for show or lots of dough, I do this for His name 
 To get it out, not to get mine exposed, don't do this for the fame 
 No time to flow bout shiny clothes, or shoes, or golden chains 
 My mind is sold to the God who rose, His truth is on my brain7 
 So while the average cats is backwards spitting battle raps 
 Wrapped up in their habitat of blasting cats, I'm rapping 'bout the Master's acts 
 Most cats just can't fathom that, that I don't the spotlight 
 It's not right, I'm not tight, I rep Him when I rock mics 
 So don't be looking at me, you see me just look on past me 
 I'm nothing special, just a vessel, service makes me happy 
 Hey if you looking for a Superstar 
 I ain't the one you searching for, I came to praise and worship, bro7 
 He's perfect I'm just dirt below 
 Hey if you looking for a Superstar 
 Don't look at me, you got me wrong, I been a sinner all along 
 Let's look at Him and not the songs 
 Let's look at Him and not the songs 
 Hey what you looking at homie? Get your eyes up off of me 
 The credit bro it's not for me, but the one who took the cross for me 
 He's holy, I ain't choose Him, He chose me, oh no He sought for me 
 Bought me, got me clean homeboy, get it right 
 What you looking at sister? I ain't nothing but dust bro 
 Who must go and rep His name, He gave me grace to trust so 
 I'm nothing more than anybody else, they in the front row 
 They think I'm special? I ain't much though no, get it right 
 Hey what you looking at homie? Nah I don't mind the autographs 
 And pictures but I ain't all for that, I'm preaching Christ and falling back 
 My mission is to lift up the risen who put the cross on back 
 I'm spitting to help them follow that vision, get it right 
 Hey what you looking at sister? Forget about my name and stuff 
 I ain't no entertainer, but hope this is entertaining just 
 So cats can hear His name discussed and trust the God I came to trust 
 His grace is enough for saving us baby, get it right 
 Hey if you looking for a Superstar 
 I ain't the one you searching for, I came to praise and worship, bro7 
 He's perfect I'm just dirt below 
 Hey if you looking for a Superstar 
 Don't look at me, you got me wrong, I been a sinner all along 
 Let's look at Him and not the songs 
 Let's look at Him and not the songs 
 Get your eyes off me, I'm just dust from the ground 
 Put your eyes on Him, Christ the Son with the crown 
 I ain't no superstar, I ain't no superstar 
 So get your eyes off me, get your eyes off me
