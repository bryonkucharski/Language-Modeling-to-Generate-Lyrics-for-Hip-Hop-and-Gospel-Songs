Ladies and Gentlemen 
 Ye yeaaaaa, Ye yeaaaaa, Ye yeaaaaa, Ye yeaaaaa 
 Ok, Let's go 
 Look 
 Homie we all fallen, friendships ain't nothin' easy 
 I get done dirty often, my folks do something greezy 
 Feel my back on the wall and, I ask my Lord to free me 
 Cause yeah anger be callin, but I know my brothers need me 
 Gotta get low till I'm crawlin, try to get humble, see we... 
 Notice each others flaws, but sometimes it's hard to see me 
 I do folk dirty too, sins that thing we sure to do 
 Jesus died to reconcile, now you gotta murder you 
 Die to self so much that you get convicted of murder too, attacking me instead of them 
 Something I must learn to do 
 Revenge I heard of you, no I ain't scurred of you 
 Cause Jesus died to kill you in me, so I scrrr from you 
 Look I've been raised with Him, taken out them chains in Him 
 Tryin' to put off anger, wrath, malice all them things in em 
 Put on meekness, kindness, patience every fight can't win em 
 Used to hold a grudge against them, lately I forgave em 
 It gets hard tryna to bear with my kind 
 But I gotta keep the gospel in mind 
 Since He rose with my life, it ain't mine 
 I'ma bear with ya, I'ma bear with ya 
 It gets hard tryna to bear with my kind 
 But I gotta keep the gospel in mind 
 Since He rose with my life, it ain't mine 
 I'ma bear with ya, I'ma bear with ya 
 You already know to bear wit'em bro (we, we, we gotta bear) 
 You already know to bear wit'em bro (eh, eh, we gotta bear) 
 You already know to bear wit'em bro bro (we, we, we gotta bear) 
 You already know to bear wit'em bro (eh, eh) 
 I know of two homies, one dude had borrowed paper 
 He took two hundred forty, he'd repay all of it later 
 He was trippin' on em, was callin something major 
 And errbody knows can't do that when it comes to paper 
 He hit him on the phone, but he ignored the calls 
 Text message, e-mail, but he ignored it all (whaa) 
 He saw him at the mall, It was a scary picture 
 He just dapped his homie up, (like whaa), like I'ma bear with ya 
 What about this married couple (whaa), been married 10 years 
 Before they tied tha knot, the husbands role had been clear (but whaa) 
 But then they life started, he seemed really sincere 
 But wrestled with laziness, been unemployed for six years 
 Was supposed to get a job, while she was out the house 
 But then she got home, he ain't got off the couch 
 Yeah she was grieved a lot, got up in his face though 
 (Like whaa) like I'ma bear with ya baby cause tha King rose 
 It gets hard tryna to bear with my kind 
 But I gotta keep the gospel in mind 
 Since He rose with my life, it ain't mine 
 I'ma bear with ya, I'ma bear with ya 
 It gets hard tryna to bear with my kind 
 But I gotta keep the gospel in mind 
 Since He rose with my life, it ain't mine 
 I'ma bear with ya, I'ma bear with ya 
 You already know to bear wit'em bro (we, we, we gotta bear) 
 You already know to bear wit'em bro (eh, eh, we gotta bear) 
 You already know to bear wit'em bro (we, we, we gotta bear) 
 You already know to bear wit'em bro (eh, eh) 
 Ok 
 Life done been crumby, since I been walkin' a young'n 
 Call me different or funny, wish I could change it like money 
 Grew up off in the country, where lookin' different meant funny 
 Stupid head or just ugly, no matter what it kept comin' 
 Askin' momma where daddy, he ain't here to protect me 
 Teach me, raise me, or carry my load when it get heavy 
 So I did it on my own, fightn carryin on 
 It don't matter what they told me dawg, I thought I was grown 
 People tell me that I'm trippin', n I tell them they wrong 
 Hollah while I'm actin' out, blamin my daddy who gone 
 Fast forward by 10, when God saved me from sin 
 And He changed my heart from dark to light to show to all men 
 And I got the conviction, call him up and stop trippin' 
 That's when I found out he's a Christian, who got saved in omission 
 That's when it goes past religion, and then it makes an incision 
 Into your heart 'n' then you start forgivin, man and start buildin 
 It gets hard tryna to bear with my kind 
 But I gotta keep the gospel in mind 
 Since He rose with my life, it ain't mine 
 I'ma bear with ya, I'ma bear with ya 
 It gets hard tryna to bear with my kind 
 But I gotta keep the gospel in mind 
 Since He rose with my life, it ain't mine 
 I'ma bear with ya, I'ma bear with ya 
 You already know to bear wit'em bro 
 You already know to bear wit'em bro 
 You already know to bear wit'em bro 
 You already know to bear wit'em bro 
 Where are my folks who sayin' "I'ma confront you of your sin, but I'ma forgive you as I've been forgiven, I ain't gonna hold it against you" 
 Let's walk together
