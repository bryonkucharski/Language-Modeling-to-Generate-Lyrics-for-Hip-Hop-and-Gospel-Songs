Get loose, if you know you got that truth 
 Say I'm not a slave don't take no abuse 
 Get loose, ever since you got that truth 
 You and God got a truce, set aside for His use 
 Get loose (Get loose) 
 Get loose (Get loose) 
 Get loose (Get loose) 
 Get loose (Get loose) 
 Get loose (Get loose) 
 Get loose (Get loose) 
 Get loose (Get loose) 
 Get loose (Get loose) 
 Everybody get loose we free from chains 
 Thanks to the King Christ Jesus man 
 Since the day we was born we was evil man 
 Being slaves was the norm then Jesus came 
 Now we stray from the norm, He redeemed us man 
 Not in prison of our sinning homie we been changed 
 In the end we'll be presented with Him free from blame 
 All because of what He did we live in freedom man 
 But its s-so whack how we g-go back 
 Back to the past like th-throwbacks 
 We ain't 'posed to act like that o-old cat 
 We in sin acting like we can't h-hold back 
 We ain't gotta act sick, we don't have to switch 
 Lil' homie go and check Romans chapter six 
 Think we gotta act bad? Nah that's a trick 
 Don't pick sin as your master to crack the whip 
 Get loose, if you know you got that truth 
 Say I'm not a slave don't take no abuse 
 Get loose, ever since you got that truth 
 You and God got a truce, set aside for His use 
 Get loose (Get loose) 
 Get loose (Get loose) 
 Get loose (Get loose) 
 Get loose (Get loose) 
 Get loose (Get loose) 
 Get loose (Get loose) 
 Get loose (Get loose) 
 Get loose (Get loose) 
 Yeah freedom was the reason He set us free 
 Yeah the Lord Christ Jesus the best you'll see 
 Get to know Him, behold Him, I guess you'll see 
 Any hour more power than a SUV 
 Yeah enough to make cats that always look to sin 
 Make them write whole verses and hooks to Him 
 Make them unfoolish students of the book like Him 
 Make them walk like, talk like, and look like Him 
 I feel s-so free, He got a hold on me 
 And it's no way I'm going to the o-old me 
 Since I'm freed from deeds how I'm posed to be 
 Man I'm staying close and praying that He m-molds me 
 I'm running from my sin 'cause I'm free from that 
 But every now and then I feel myself creeping back 
 Then I run to the Word where Jesus at 
 And pray He'll lead my life and be pleased with that 
 Get loose, if you know you got that truth 
 Say I'm not a slave don't take no abuse 
 Get loose, ever since you got that truth 
 You and God got a truce, set aside for His use 
 Get loose (Get loose) 
 Get loose (Get loose) 
 Get loose (Get loose) 
 Get loose (Get loose) 
 Get loose (Get loose) 
 Get loose (Get loose) 
 Get loose (Get loose) 
 Get loose (Get loose) 
 Nah we ain't gon' take that no more 
 In sin and your growth on slow mo 
 No more drank, no dro to blow 
 Trying to push you to the Lord that's what I flow for (flow for) 
 So bro, let's celebrate we free dog 
 Sin ain't got a hold on me dog 
 Running back to the Lord when we fall (we fall)
