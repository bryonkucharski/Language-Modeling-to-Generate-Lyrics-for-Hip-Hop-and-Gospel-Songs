This is the end of my show, this is the end I know 
 I can't perform no more (eh eh) 
 Can't fight this war no more (eh eh) 
 I can't endure no more, all ashamed and pain 
 I'm feelin' strained and can't go on this tour no more 
 I'm so tired of this tight rope walk 
 Homie I might go psycho my life's strung off 
 Eh it's the rest for my soul can this mic go off 
 I ain't steppin on the stage tonight, shows off 
 This is the end of my show, this is the end I know 
 I know these chains had me trapped for a while 
 Don't know when I last relaxed with a smile 
 I need a Saviour ta crack through the clouds 
 Shows over gotta turn my back to the crowd 
 I know these chains had me trapped for a while 
 Don't know when I last relaxed with a smile 
 I need a Saviour ta crack through the clouds 
 Shows over gotta turn my back to the crowd 
 I can't perform no more (eh eh) 
 Can't run this course no more (eh eh) 
 I been tryna keep up this image to let 'em see that I'm different 
 I'm slippin and this is stuff that I can't ignore no more (they trippin') 
 Can't let these tears hit the floor no more (they trippin') 
 Because of fear I can't (afford?) no more 
 Is it a lie what I've been, tryna hide all my sin 'n 
 Imprisoned and can't no one open the door no more 
 Tired of tryna be righteous, got my world dark 
 Like somebody hit the light switch, I don't know where to start 
 'Cause I really don't like this, its heavy on my heart (nah) 
 Somebody get me out this crisis, my pain is off the chart (please) 
 This is the end of my show, this is the end I know 
 I know these chains had me trapped for a while 
 Don't know when I last relaxed with a smile

 I can't perform no more (eh eh) 
 Can't do these chores no more (eh eh) 
 I'm feelin' like I'm sick, it's silly so I quit 
 That's it, I just can't try to please the Lord no more 
 Cause really I'm sick of tryna make Him like me more (you feel me) 
 Cause every day I got a fight in store 
 I'm guilty so when I play I never like to score 
 No good in me n I'm sick of my plight I'm poor 
 They told me homie (whaa) the Christian life is better (word) 
 But they said to be holy 'n' perform for His pleasure 
 But now I'm feelin' torn cause the Lord is my treasure 
 But I fall and feel scorned when I can't get it together 
 But then something clicked, its crazy I ignored this 
 But even when I slip, this ain't based on my performance 
 Christ was equipped, ran a race with endurance 
 When His flesh was hit, His righteousness was my assurance (yeah!) 
 I know dem chains had me trapped for a while 
 That's in my past, I relaxed in Him now 
 Christ my Saviour He cracked through the clouds 
 Did it perfect, listen to the claps from the crowd
