There is a young girl 
 Up in her teenage years 
 Up in the world thriving with teenage peers 
 She's popular 
 But there is one thing to be made clear 
 Low self esteem was the reason for her teenage tears 
 She thought she wasn't pretty enough 
 Or cool as the next chick 
 Wasn't skinny enough 
 So dudes she would mess with 
 So they would be chillin' with her 
 And she'd feel accepted 
 And in the end what up she still get rejected 
 She couldn't really see seeking the Lord 
 But thought she could find peace 
 In an eating disorder 
 Everytime she loose 10 
 And said just 10 more 
 But her friends all confused 
 Like what you doing this for huh 
 Started to cling to this foolish disorder 
 Figured it's all she had 
 If the students ignored her 
 Dag I'm praying for my sister 
 That she would cling to the God 
 That can save and deliver 
 I'm praying for my sister 
 That she would cling to the God 
 That can save and deliver 
 True security is found in Christ 
 He will never leave you 
 He's down and around for life 
 I'm praying for my sister 
 That she would cling to the God 
 That can save and deliver 
 True security is found in Christ 
 He will never leave you 
 He's down and around for life 
 There's a young dude up in his teenage years 
 Huggin a black grafitter 
 With his teenage peers 
 He still does it 
 One thing to be made clear 
 Not be the down with the rest 
 Is his Teenage fears 
 And where he come from 
 Selling work ain't that crazy 
 It's few kats his age that ain't had babies 
 All he wants to do lay around 
 And hang out crazy 
 Maybe smoke something drank 
 Got his vision hazy 
 Plus he just got the new Jeezy CD 
 Wanna be like the D boys he see on TV 
 Heard of church but ain't got a suit that's 3 piece 
 So he think that it just ain't for him 
 Some girls down the block 
 Want a date from him 
 A decade down the road his baby will be ten 
 He'll be locked up 
 I am praying for my brother 
 That he would cling to God 
 That can save when we suffer 
 I am praying for my brother 
 That he would cling to God 
 That can save when we suffer 
 True Security is found in Christ 
 He will never leave you 
 He is down and around for life 
 I am praying for my brother 
 That he would cling to God 
 That can save when we suffer 
 True Security is found in Christ 
 He will never leave you 
 He is down and around for life 
 Another young one up in they teenage years 
 Put on a pedestal 
 Above all they teenage peers 
 Father's a Pastor 
 One thing he made clear we serve Christ 
 But daddy couldn't see their tears 
 See they felt insufficient 
 Like they could not match up to dad 
 No matter how much good they stacked 
 Like they was failing 
 Every single test they faced 
 And felt like Satan next to their expectations 
 Suicidal thoughts went through their brain 
 They dreams of killing myself 
 Didn't realize Christ is perfect in our weakness 
 So they tried to hide it 
 Like they life was sweetness 
 Frontin in front of fam even quotin scripture 
 Just couldn't understand 
 He who wrote the scripture 
 Dag I am praying for my Family 
 That we would realize he died 
 So guys would have a plan b 
 I am praying for my sisters 
 That they would cling to the God 
 Who can save and deliver 
 True Security is found in Christ 
 He will never leave you 
 He is down and around for life 
 I am praying for my brothers 
 That he would cling to God 
 That can save when we suffer 
 True Security is found in Christ 
 He will never leave you 
 He is down and around for life 
 I am praying for my Family 
 That we would realize he died 
 So guys would have a plan b 
 True Security is found in Christ 
 He will never leave you 
 He is down and around for life 
 Yeah I'm praying for my family 
 That we would realize 
 That he died so guys would have a plan b 
 True security is found in Christ 
 He will never leave you 
 He is down and around for life 
 spoken: 
 Yeah True Security is found in Christ 
 You don't have to search for it in ourselves 
 Or in that dude or in that female 
 Or acceptance from men 
 True security is found in Jesus Christ 
 The only place to find it 
 Praise the Lord that he died 
 And we can come to him 
 Find our security in him 
 Find our everything in him 
 Only in Christ
