I gotta brag on my KING so that we can see him clearer 
 We only know in part 'cause we peekin' in a mirror 
 We see He flipped everything He's on another tier 
 That's why they didn't recognize the King when He appeared 
 Most kings got bling they don't welcome any peers 
 Then you kiss a ring and they tell you ,"Disappear" 
 You better listen here, my King flipped that cause He made Himself poor and He came real near 
 Most kings rule hard tryin' to instill fear 
 My King drew close, healed folks, shed tears 
 Some kings act the fool similar to King Lear 
 My King did the Father's will yeah He let Him steer 
 Most kings roll fly you can catch em in a lear 
 My King rode in on a donkey yeah that's weird 
 listen to Him no jeer 
 His words are our peace 
 My game plan is what I hear - I play it by ear 
 They ain't got a King like mine - on the front line on the scene like mine 
 Flawless - no he ain't clean like mine 
 Never has another been seen like mine 
 They thought He shoulda been ballin' and He flipped that 
 They thought He shoulda been flossin' and He flipped that 
 He ain't do it like we thought 'cause he flipped that 
 Hands in the air - wave em till He get back 
 He's the King of Glory - Holy moly 
 Came to earth put a twist in the story 
 The uncreated Creator - the Only 
 Left His place on the throne for the lowly 
 Humiliated while blessing all His haters 
 Other kings say lets load the gankers 
 Word 
 He fixed the syntax 
 The king's ransom paid all my sin tax 
 They ain't got a King like mine - on the front line on the scene like mine 
 Flawless - no he ain't clean like mine 
 Never has another been seen like mine 
 They thought he shoulda been ballin' and He flipped that 
 They thought He shoulda been flossin' and He flipped that 
 He ain't do it like we thought cause He flipped that 
 Hands in the air - wave em till He get back 
 He wore a crown of thorns, enrobed in flesh 
 Obedient to God, made his road to death 
 Most kings kill rebels, but behold we're blessed 
 My king died so the rebels' souls could rest 
 The King's death didn't mean I lost no chess 
 'Cause He rose, now glorious His robe is fresh 
 Ain't nobody next, no heirs to the throne and there'll never be a day when he's gone 
 His reign is forever, my King is a treasure, found in a field value can't be measured 
 He's that pearl of great price there is none better 
 He paid a great price -His life- not cheddar 
 We don't want to leave His kingdom, 
 He won't let us 
 His enemies try to pluck us, they can't get us 
 They lie to us but the great King wrote letters 
 Plus our King is goin' to come back to get us - Yeah! 
 They ain't got a King like mine - on the front line on the scene like mine 
 Flawless - no he ain't clean like mine 
 Never has another been seen like mine 
 They thought He shoulda been ballin' and He flipped that 
 They thought He shoulda been flossin' and He flipped that 
 He ain't do it like we thought cause He flipped that 
 Hands in the air - wave 'em till He get back
