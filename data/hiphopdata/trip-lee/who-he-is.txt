Lecrae: 
 I know His Grace is amazing, face it ain't another like our God 
 From the foundation's placements, nations, they've been placed underneath His rod 
 Oh my God, You're the one worth the praise so bump the peso, cause You say so 
 I keep Your ways in front of me until my days go 
 So they can have the women, they can keep that queso 
 Hey yo, that's why we don't roll with the drama 
 Don't get drunk, don't roll marijauna 
 Not because hell's hot like the coals in a sauna 
 But we love God and we go where He wanna 
 Himself, the best gift He could ever give 
 Who can take a set of kids trippin' off of sedatives 
 Give them the grace that pays their eternal deficit 
 Now we enjoy God and all of His preeminence, listen in 
 Because of who He is 
 If I'm worthy dying for, yes this God is worth living for 
 Because of who He is He makes me want to give Him more and more 
 Because of who He is 
 So I take my body and use it for the glory of God 
 That's why I pray every day, gotta pick up my cross 
 Search for the lost, no matter the cost 
 (Repeat) 
 Trip Lee: 
 Yeah, yeah, okay okay okay 
 Look, He reigns over all, it's plain since the fall, our brains don't recall who He is (Yahweh!) 
 His name's over all, His aim is for all, to remain in awe as they see His 
 Beauty man it's truly crazy, His beauty is grand His truth is great we 
 Dudes should stand and truly praise the beautiful lamb they bruised Him greatly 
 His life was the cost, He died on the cross, He died for the lost, we know that 
 So we ride for the boss, He's high we exalt, this Christ in our thoughts, can't hold back 
 Exalt Him up in our actions too, we crackin' 'em Johnny Macs and we cruise 
 The facts, we grabbin' His active truth, we happy when our Dad's in our view 
 Lecrae: 
 Tell me, who you know can control the globe 
 Walk in His holy home, walk down a lowly road, 
 Roll where the stones get thrown at ya dome 
 Cause you made it known you're the son of God on the throne 
 He deserve more, this is why we flow 
 Not that we could ever pay Him back what we owe 
 But if we don't flow then we might as well go 
 And let the whole world know He is God all alone 
 Trip Lee: 
 Okay, He's gracious, great, He's way too good (too good), can't believe that He made us kids 
 No righteousness in the place we stood (so what), so He died and He gave us His 
 You might wonder why we live that bro (why we did), we ain't just tryna live by some principles (man why?) 
 We love Him can't get enough of him, so that's the God we living for 
 Cam: 
 Like Trip say, He's just way too good (way too good) 
 Thinkin' of myself compared to Him, He's just way too good (way too good) 
 Now I understand my place, layin' in grace, so glad that He took my case 
 I use my freedom in Christ to become enslaved, to the day that I see His face
