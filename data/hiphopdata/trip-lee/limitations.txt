You know we feelin' like we can't move many times 
 So we waitin for a break through at any time 
 So many things that we can't do, we really find 
 That any climb can be strangled in any grind 
 Can get tangled we get behind 
 And in the end they find, we feelin' trapped like prison time 
 Got big vision, we're beginning tryin' 
 But ain't grinnin when we gettin' to the finish line 
 And we all feelin' like we been tryin' for too long 
 This day been racin through my mind for too long 
 I can't be runnin' in place, do I need to save face and move on? 
 I watched friends fall short, I've seen many cryin 
 I watched my dad breath his last, we are really dyin' 
 If I can grasp in my past, I see many times 
 When I was really tryin', but was limited by His design 
 This is the way that life will be, limitless You put limits on me 
 By Your grace, help us see, this is Your design 
 This is the way that life will be, infinite You made finite me 
 By Your grace, help us see, this is the way this is the way that life will be 
 So many things that we wanna get our hands on 
 So many heights we wanna reach that we planned on 
 And we was thinkin' we just missed our chance homes 
 But our reach ain't long enough no matter what we stand on 
 I'll never be the kind of rapper that I like to be (yeah, yeah) 
 And I can see all the books that I like to read (yeah, yeah) 
 And twice the speed all the folks that I'd like to reach 
 I like to speak, but I'm limited my might is weak 
 Though God was pleased with the creation of man 
 We still gotta understand the limitations of man 
 Many of us stuck in the days of the trance 
 Man, thinking we can do some things that we can't 
 You may be thinkin' you beast but believe me 
 You still gotta sleep in the evening, 
 Ya you still gotta eat, need heat when its freezing 
 You peak for a season, but peep what we speakin' 
 This is the way that life will be, limitless You put limits on me 
 By Your grace, help us see, this is Your design 
 This is the way that life will be, infinite You made finite me 
 By Your grace, help us see, this is the way this is the way that life will be 
 I know some folks who ain't poor they crusin 
 We can work hard but if the Lord ain't movin 
 No fruit in store man before they ruin 
 They should trust God who supports they doin' 
 We not in control of the earth He's the owner 
 One day we get work, next day we a goner 
 Humanity's not getting any stronger, so we shouldn't front any longer 
 Behold the God of wonders, He has no hunger 
 Never does He sleep or He slumber 
 He's never limited, no enemies can ever come up 
 We're the victory He's got the one up, He runs us (He runs us) 
 So let's submit to that King who's in the skies 
 This is something that we can't do in our pride 
 Humble yourself under His name dude He is God 
 All powerful until the end of time 
 This is the way that life will be, limitless You put limits on me 
 By Your grace, help us see, this is Your design 
 This is the way that life will be, infinite You made finite me 
 By Your grace, help us see, this is the way this is the way that life will be 
 This is the way that life will be, limitless You put limits on me 
 By Your grace, help us see, this is Your design 
 This is the way that life will be, infinite You made finite me 
 By Your grace, help us see, this is the way this is the way that life will be
