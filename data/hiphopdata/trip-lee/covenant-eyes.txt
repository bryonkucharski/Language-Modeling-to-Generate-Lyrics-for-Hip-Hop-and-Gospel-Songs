Look at dat, what you lookin at 
 Look at dat, what you lookin at 
 Look at dat, what you lookin at 
 In a culture that is crazy, in a world that is fallen 
 Its hard tryna live this thang according to Your callin 
 Every time steppin at my heart its steady prowlin 
 Desires wagin war back n forth like they brawlin 
 Yea man hold up, I'm hopin when you see me 
 That you catch me watchin what I'm watchin it ain't easy 
 My heart it wants to see joy, but there's too many decoys 
 And I don't wanna end up in a trap like a dboy 
 Can't be all relaxed, there ain't no time for getting lazy 
 Time for us to act cause the times are getting crazy 
 So I wrote an agreement and I made my eyes sign it 
 I won't look on a woman with no lust now underline it 
 Look at dat, what you lookin at 
 Oooo she lookin good nah man I aint lookin back 
 Im watchin what I'm watchin, and yea this thang hard 
 Better watchin what I'm watchin we gotta be on guard 
 Look at dat, what you lookin at 
 Oooo she lookin good nah man I aint lookin back 
 Im watchin what I'm watchin, and yea this thang hard 
 Better watchin what I'm watchin we gotta be on guard 
 Now if I listen to the radio 
 Then I would have to split open the swisha and fill it with green vine 
 And if I listen to the TV then you can catch me chasin plenty chicks cause homie they fine 
 But I DDT my mind put my flesh in the figure four 
 Yea sometimes I fall but this right here ain't gon kill me folk 
 Cause if I had to be a blind amputee, I guarantee my Father here is purging me of all my impurity 
 Bang on em ba-bbang on go hard Father rain on em ra-rrain on em show you God 
 Cause every time I slow up, that's when my Father show up 
 Make make ways of escape then I'm right back scrappin like what up 
 Tell my TV to shutup what you sellin I don't want it 
 Hide that Word inside my heart, Ron Artest go & guard it no 
 I don't want your goodies baby you can keep your cookies lady 
 I know they got M&MS but this road I'm on is slim and shady 
 Look at dat, what you lookin at 
 Oooo she lookin good nah man I aint lookin back 
 Im watchin what I'm watchin, and yea this thang hard 
 Better watchin what I'm watchin we gotta be on guard 
 Look at dat, what you lookin at 
 Oooo she lookin good nah man I aint lookin back 
 Im watchin what I'm watchin, and yea this thang hard 
 Better watchin what I'm watchin we gotta be on guard 
 With every single glance man my sin tries to kill me 
 So I ain't givin in all my brothers gotta feel me 
 I'm free from my slavery you know that aint the real me 
 I belong to my God and I can't let no lust steal me 
 There's nothing I can gain the sister shouldn't move me 
 Cause my God is holy the epitome of beauty 
 Bought me with a price and I'm prayin He would rule me 
 My eyes belong to Him He's my King and Lord truly 
 As men who trust Jesus, we can't be cool wit all dat 
 So when my eyes start to trip, I tell em boys to fall back 
 So if you see me look away don't be surprised 
 Since I'm in love with my God, I got some covenant eyes 
 Look at dat, what you lookin at 
 Oooo she lookin good nah man I aint lookin back 
 Im watchin what I'm watchin, and yea this thang hard 
 Better watchin what I'm watchin we gotta be on guard 
 Look at dat, what you lookin at 
 Oooo she lookin good nah man I aint lookin back 
 Im watchin what I'm watchin, and yea this thang hard 
 Better watchin what I'm watchin we gotta be on guard
