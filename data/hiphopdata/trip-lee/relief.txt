Ah what a relief it is 
 To be in Christ He's the life that I need to live 
 I'm in love with the fact, that some sheep are His 
 What would for your own? He would bleed for His 
 I heard of other Gods, but none of them are like Him 
 They sit up in they paradise lamping 
 But He's perfect and it's odd, cause though they would deny Him 
 He came down and met His own standards 
 His own commandments, and laws 
 But man we are flawed, none of us could stand since the fall 
 But His plan was to call, He who answered was called 
 A son, when you come all your sins are dissolved 
 Yep I'm in awe 'cause I'm sick of my sin 
 But since we been bought we've forgiven through Him 
 A great family, we in it's crazy 
 The road that we travel is slimmer than Shady 
 Ah what a relief it is 
 To be in Christ, He's the life that we need to live 
 What a relief it is to be in Jesus 
 What a relief it is to rest in you 
 Ah what a relief it is 
 To be in Christ He's the life that I need to live 
 I'm blown away when I peek at the deeds He did 
 I'm quite speechless, He's more than Easter His 
 Great advent destroyed the works of the demons and evil prince 
 Let His deeds convince 
 Seen by some as a great man who teaches sense 
 And good morals, but please don't be content 
 With that reading of Jesus, He was sent 
 He made legions and seas repent, anyone's weak 
 People are feeble, with evil bents 
 Name stuff, all things they sit at the Son's feet 
 The wage we earned was lethal hence 
 The death He had to die, wrath satisfied 
 Now believers are righteous in the legal sense 
 Justified by His grace, let our deeds convince 
 Ah what a relief it is 
 To be in Christ, He's the life that we need to live 
 What a relief it is to be in Jesus 
 What a relief it is to rest in you 
 Ah what a relief it is 
 To be in Christ He's the life that I need to live 
 When my life ain't right, gotta peak at His 
 Take notes, see what true strength and meakness is 
 He lived the we couldn't, 'cause we rebel 
 We so sinful, and we let them deeds prevail 
 But even if we tried, to seek Him in our lives 
 We can't, we weak and we need Him to provide 
 Just look at our corruption there's a clear problem 
 The raping, the robbing to God it's disgusting 
 The lust and the pride can't just be covered up 
 With a bunch of other stuff we must trust Him 
 I praise Him that we did, some was bumping in the club 
 Others was toting a pump and running with them thugs 
 But look at us now we ain't running with them bloods 
 If you see some red on us it's 'cause we covered in His blood 
 Ah what a relief it is 
 To be in Christ, He's the life that we need to live 
 What a relief it is to be in Jesus 
 What a relief it is to rest in you
