Sometimes I sit and reflect on the life I'm leadin 
 It's goin' so fast it is like I'm speedin 
 Sometimes I wake up and it's like I'm dreamin' 
 Already 22? 16 was last weekend 
 Been a crazy year, dad died I'm grievin 
 Man I really miss him, I wish he was still breathin 
 Two days later got a wife I'm cleavin 
 Couple weddin pics caught your boy straight cheezin 
 Now tell me how I'm 'pposed to fight, can your boy stay firm? 
 In this life when the joys and the pains take turns 
 You're at work in our world where some things they burn 
 You're not honoured when your boy can't learn 
 How I must respond to Your works and the cards that You deal me 
 Aware of my frailty I'm beggin You to help me 
 How can I be a steward actin' healthy 
 I know Your grace won't fail me 
 All of my life is Yours to own, You orchestrate it all along 
 And if my life is a cup come fill it up, so the whole world can see what You've done 
 All of my life is Yours to own, You orchestrate it all along 
 And if my life is a cup come fill it up, so the whole world can see what You've done 
 You placed me in the city that I'm in for a reason 
 Sent folks in my life that was friends for a season 
 Some exposed my flaws and my sin it wasn't pleasin 
 And others fell from the faith 'n' was leavin' 
 If I respond wrong I'm dishonorin' Your grace 
 And I'm kind of just a product of my mind and not the faith 
 But You are my Father the refiner full of grace 
 And You're the designer of my time and in my place 
 I could take the easy route and follow all the trends 
 Of my brothers and my sisters, pastors and my friends 
 It probably wouldn't lead to a disaster in the end 
 But I can't be followin the path You givin' them 
 Yup, you made me me, with my own set of gifts 
 So I won't settle for less You bless You never miss miss 
 I'll be steward who You made me, steward where You place me 
 And I pray that You use me like crazy 
 All of my life is Yours to own, You orchestrate it all along 
 And if my life is a cup come fill it up, so the whole world can see what You've done 
 All of my life is Yours to own, You orchestrate it all along 
 And if my life is a cup come fill it up, so the whole world can see what You've done 
 You send the sun and the rain on Your servant Lord 
 Lord when You send them my way, I be respondin right way 
 You move and orchestrate the things in my life for good 
 I wanna use 'em in a way that shows 'em how Your grace acts 
 You been consistent every minute like I knew You would 
 I'm so in love with Your truths, I wanna trust You and move 
 I feel my confidence is high, Your providence for You I'm good good good 
 I've got no worries at all since I heard that You call 
 All of my life is Yours to own (It's Yours to own Lord), You orchestrate it all along (all along) 
 And if my life is a cup come fill it up, so the whole world can see what You've done (yeah) 
 All of my life is Yours to own (it's all Yours), You orchestrate it all along (it's all Yours) 
 And if my life is a cup come fill it up, so the whole world can see what You've done 
 All of my life is Yours to own, You orchestrate it all along 
 And if my life is a cup come fill it up, so the whole world can see what You've done 
 All of my life is Yours to own, You orchestrate it all along 
 And if my life is a cup come fill it up, so the whole world can see what You've done 
 So the whole world, so the whole world, so the whole world can see what You've done 
 So the whole world, so the whole world, so the whole world can see what You've done
