They amazed at how we living for Him bro, they tripping when we show 
 That He's so superior that's why we pick Him over dough 
 We don't need anything in addition to Him bro 
 He's sufficient for us Christians if you with Him then you know 
 That's why we hedonists, you need to listen to the flow 
 On top of the beat and rhythm, we forgiven so we go 
 In pursuit of He who's risen the beginning of it bro 
 He's the gem the streets are missing but we get Him that's fa sho 
 That's too great, we too glad to have Him 
 The true facts, dude that's true satisfaction 
 Dudes ask, why you chase Christ instead of status? 
 Because He's steady plus what I'm getting is everlasting 
 We used to chase after dimes, that was great they was fine 
 In the face, in the waist, the mistake we was trying 
 To find true pleasure minus faith in the divine 
 We was lying to ourselves, now we chasing the vine 
 Them cats they try to gain but they won't be 
 Satisfied with the gain that they gon see 
 Them cats should try to seek Him 'cause I know the Lord 
 Satisfies beyond anything we'd hope for 
 The motto of the culture is touch me and tease me, rush to the easy 
 Things that seem pleasing like lust and the breezies 
 Seek the plush, eat it up, I would feed me 
 But it wasn't much plus it would flee me 
 So I changed what I was chasing it switched from chicks 
 To the King He replaced em 
 Now I hit the script to embrace Him I'm changing 
 Sins seem less appealing when I get the real thing 
 I race to erase them 
 Forget about the cash, not simply because not a cent of it will last 
 But its missing what He has 
 It's trivial if its mission isn't living with my dad 
 Getting intimate with Him living for Him instead of trash 
 Now I'm driven by the fact as I strive to win 
 That He's glorified in me when I'm satisfied in Him 
 If I miss it then that's wack keep my eyes on Him 
 And I get it on the track I run hard to Him 
 Them cats they try to gain but they won't be 
 Satisfied with the gain that they gon see 
 Them cats should try to seek Him 'cause I know the Lord 
 Satisfies beyond anything we'd hope for 
 Now my life is the pursuit, of delighting in His truth 
 In His person, His works yeah I'm fighting for this fruit 
 Of His light in my life it's me striving to be like Him 
 Remember Him like the Titans, I'm dying to be renewed 
 Don't get it twisted like I am the reason to 
 Run forward to the throne, no the lion is in my view 
 He's shown to be glorious, when shown to be more to us 
 Than anything in sight pray our idols will be removed 
 It doesn't show the Lord's beauty, when I treat Him as duty 
 A God who doesn't truly, inside please or move me 
 So I reach for the truth He's my God a precious ruby 
 More entertaining than movies, greater than chasing hoochies 
 And when I forget I gotta take in the view we 
 Dive in His Word just to gaze at His beauty 
 And I really hope guys get the picture 
 True satisfactions in the God of the scriptures 
 Them cats they try to gain but they won't be 
 Satisfied with the gain that they gon see 
 Them cats should try to seek Him 'cause I know the Lord 
 Satisfies beyond anything we'd hope for 
 Say I'm a hedonist I seek my pleasure 
 Not in sex nope He's much better 
 Not in wealth nah He's my treasure 
 Pursuing anything else will just upset you 
 Say I'm a hedonist I seek my pleasure 
 Not in sex nope He's much better 
 Not in wealth nah He's my treasure 
 My King offers me satisfaction beyond measure
