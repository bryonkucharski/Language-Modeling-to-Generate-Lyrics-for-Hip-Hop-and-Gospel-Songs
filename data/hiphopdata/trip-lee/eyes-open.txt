Good evening brethren, let's go a special direction 
 Look back, let's meet a young'n that was born in 87 
 His parents was so happy, rejoicing at they new blessing 
 He breathes life, at the same time death without a question 
 His parents gazed in his eyes, adoring him as he hollers 
 He got his eyes from his mama, he got his nose from his father 
 Its crazy how this baby, is so precious but I'm saddened 
 He got his name from grandfather, his depravity from Adam 
 That's how it goes and hey look as he grows 
 You can see he's so blind, his eyes seem as they closed 
 He's so weak and it shows, he can't keep from what He knows 
 Is wrong, he knows it's bad but dag he wants it though 
 And all throughout his years, he looks good to his peers 
 And his parents, and his self but if we could only peer 
 On the inside, we'd see that from the start it was dark 
 Until a Savior stepped in and gave Him a new heart, eyes opened! 
 I know I once was blind, Oh Lord but now I see 
 You sent your Son from above to come and rescue me 
 He's the light of the world, maker of you and me 
 His Spirit shines so bright for all of us to see 
 Now that my vision's clear, Oh Lord we sing your praise 
 And pray that those in the world would turn and seek your face 
 Father we thank you for eyes to see so we can know you and love you forever 
 So that we can love you forever 
 So that we can love you forever 
 Yeah I was blinded in the past, like my mind was in the trash 
 Incapable of doing good or even finding him the task 
 Was beyond what I could grasp, my righteousness is rags 
 So He had to do all the work, by His design you do the math 
 The math, who get's the glory, hey who get's the praise? 
 Predestined, I was elected, resurrected from the grave 
 Plus His loved was never based on my past or present state 
 On anything that I obtained I was a mess but blessed with grace 
 By grace, I'm in love with Him 
 He gave me something within 
 He doesn't love me cause of me nope He loves me because of Him 
 No He didn't have to save and raise me when I was dead 
 But He dragged me out the morgue, now the praise of His name is spread 
 He died for all He would save, it's crazy the Savior bled 
 Erasing taking my dread, and gave me some grace instead 
 The kind I wouldn't resist, I came praise be to Him 
 And I'm confident if I'm in Him Ima make it to the end with eyes open 
 I know I once was blind, Oh Lord but now I see 
 You sent your Son from above to come and rescue me 
 He's the light of the world, maker of you and me 
 His Spirit shines so bright for all of us to see 
 Now that my vision's clear, Oh Lord we sing your praise 
 And pray that those in the world would turn and seek your face 
 Father we thank you for eyes to see so we can know you and love you forever 
 So that we can love you forever 
 So that we can love you forever 
 Now that my eyes is open, gotta keep that Bible open 
 Not just so that I can quote Him, I'm hopin that I'll behold Him 
 Until I lay in the grave, I'm praying I'll stay in motion 
 Gazing with eyes of faith He gave me baby, I'm focused 
 I'm praying all through my 20's I'll see Him in 20/20 
 Looking at Him till I look like Him almost like His twin He's 
 So merciful, His Word is so packed I'm telling many 
 About the glory of Christ, tryna rep Him with all that's in me 
 I know I once was blind, Oh Lord but now I see 
 You sent your Son from above to come and rescue me 
 He's the light of the world, maker of you and me 
 His Spirit shines so bright for all of us to see 
 Now that my vision's clear, Oh Lord we sing your praise 
 And pray that those in the world would turn and seek your face 
 Father we thank you for eyes to see so we can know you and love you forever 
 So that we can love you forever 
 So that we can love you forever
