I am not your robot, I am not a clone 
 You are not my puppeteer and I am not a drone 
 Got a new master and I follow him alone 
 I want a good life till I'm gone, it's on 
 Hey I was born less than human, I know it sounds crazy 
 But I was really born a robot as a baby 
 No real life in me, I just played my role 
 No self-control, I just did what I was told 
 I got my first order, I was just a day old 
 But I didn't have a chance 'cause my heart was way cold 
 My heart took the orders, it couldn't break the mold 
 Sold under bondage and I couldn't take control 
 So I was just chilling in my robot clothes 
 With my robot friends, and my robot flows 
 Living robot ways, 'cause that's all I know 
 Till I heard I could be freed from my robot soul 
 I'm like ... 
 Why you always tryin' to control me? 
 You are not my boss, that's the old me 
 Obviously you don't know my style 
 I'm not a, I'm not a robot now 
 I'm not a, I'm not a, I am not a robot 
 I'm not a, I'm not a robot now 
 I'm not a, I'm not a, I am not a robot 
 I'm not a, I'm not a robot now 
 The crazy thing is I ain't know I was robot 
 So I ain't have a whole lot of plans for me to roll out 
 Thought I was unique, I thought that I was so hot 
 But I was just like them other drones, I was so locked 
 Brainwashed, I was listening to lies 
 The freedom that I thought I had was really a mirage 
 Made my own choices, but it was a disguise 
 The only thing I really did was pick a different lie 
 So I was still a drone, nothing but a clone 
 I only knew the lies 'cause that's all that I was shown 
 But I been remade, my heart is no longer stone 
 Where my ex-robots who can sing this song? 
 Now I've been remade, and I'm no longer hollow 
 A real man came, changed everything that I know 
 He gave me truth, that's a hard pill to swallow 
 Gave me new commands, and he freed me up to follow 
 Why you always tryin' to control me? 
 You are not my boss, that's the old me 
 Obviously you don't know my style 
 I'm not a, I'm not a robot now 
 I'm not a, I'm not a, I am not a robot 
 I'm not a, I'm not a robot now 
 I'm not a, I'm not a, I am not a robot 
 I'm not a, I'm not a robot now 
 I am not your robot, I am not a clone 
 You are not my puppeteer and I am not a drone 
 Got a new master and I follow him alone 
 I want a good life till I'm gone, it's on 
 Hey world, you know I see your game 
 And I don't need your lies, I ain't worried 'bout a thing 
 Hey devil, I know you want me chained 
 But you have been defeated, and your power's been drained 
 Hey flesh, I know you bear my name 
 I know you love the lies, but I'm steady tryna change 
 You mighta been confused, but this a new day 
 I'm saved now, I ain't gotta do what you say! 
 And to my friends who are still on lockdown 
 Still controlled by their passions, stop now 
 'Cause he can free everybody from the top down 
 If you're freed up, say this with me right now 
 (Change) 
 I'm not a, I'm not a robot now 
 I'm not a, I'm not a robot now 
 I'm not a, I'm not a, I am not a robot 
 I'm not a, I'm not a robot now 
 Why you always tryin' to control me? 
 You are not my boss, that's the old me 
 Obviously you don't know my style 
 I'm not a, I'm not a robot now 
 I'm not a, I'm not a, I am not a robot 
 I'm not a, I'm not a robot now 
 I'm not a, I'm not a, I am not a robot 
 I'm not a, I'm not a robot now
