I told them brothers that his standard's too high 
 I ain't stutter but they wonder how I plan on getting by 
 I just tell them I ain't got no worries, we ain't worried 'bout a thing 
 Nah I ain't got no worries, we ain't worried 'bout a thing 
 I told them brothers that his standard's too high 
 I ain't stutter but they wonder how I plan on getting by 
 I just tell them I ain't got no worries, we ain't worried 'bout a thing 
 Nah I ain't got no worries, we ain't worried 'bout a thing 
 Yeah I'm focused on the prize, my homies by my side 
 We bumpin Sho Baraka while we rolling in the ride 
 We got the windows open, hoping they can hear the cries 
 But no fear is in our sight, man you can focus on my eyes 
 We ain't worried 'bout a thing, we got hope you can't describe 
 It ain't because we perfect, we got motives that should die 
 Let's be open, we broken, we ain't posing in disguise 
 Our hearts is cold and fallen like some snow up in the skies 
 Hey if you know me then you know, I ain't got a clean past 
 I had idols in my heart hoping for that green cash 
 Instead of chasing treasure, I would chase obscene trash 
 I deserve the see wrath, but He switched the scene fast 
 (Hold up) I can't find a way get this out in words 
 Other than to say that I don't get what I deserve 
 I'm so filthy but seen as not guilty 
 I'm obscene but I'm seen like I'm clean, what it mean? 
 I told them brothers that his standard's too high 
 I ain't stutter but they wonder how I plan on getting by 
 I just tell them I ain't got no worries, we ain't worried 'bout a thing 
 Nah I ain't got no worries, we ain't worried 'bout a thing 
 I told them brothers that his standard's too high 
 I ain't stutter but they wonder how I plan on getting by 
 I just tell them I ain't got no worries, we ain't worried 'bout a thing 
 Nah I ain't got no worries, we ain't worried 'bout a thing 
 You might have seen us on the block, or seen us in the stores 
 A clique of us who chilling, not the cleanest with the clothes 
 Not the hottest with the cars, or the meanest with the flows 
 But we smiling like we styling, cause He freed us from His blows 
 The Father hates sin, and that's the thing that we had chose 
 And yeah that caused a problem, it's the King that we opposed 
 We worked against Him daily, which brought us to be his foes 
 It was a wrap, unless we found a way to clean us like some clothes 
 Many of us tried but we failed on a daily 
 Falling short was crazy, we thought that we could be better 
 But then I saw that my efforts couldn't save me 
 Because of all my dark nights [knights] minus Heath Ledger 
 But I heard of a way to be acquitted of my crimes 
 Entered a new era that's been fitted on our mind 
 So our thinking's really changed, we linking with a chain 
 We don't get what we deserve, it's really strange 
 I told them brothers that his standard's too high 
 I ain't stutter but they wonder how I plan on getting by 
 I just tell them I ain't got no worries, we ain't worried 'bout a thing 
 Nah I ain't got no worries, we ain't worried 'bout a thing 
 I told them brothers that his standard's too high 
 I ain't stutter but they wonder how I plan on getting by 
 I just tell them I ain't got no worries, we ain't worried 'bout a thing 
 Nah I ain't got no worries, we ain't worried 'bout a thing 
 So when this life is over, no Hell we tell them hold up 
 No burdens on our backs we brush the dirt off of our shoulders 
 Look I know what we saying sounds backwards like we Yoda 
 But I praise Him for the Gospel and the fact we got exposure 
 We ain't staggering we walk the straight and narrow 'cause we sober 
 We press into the Kingdom by the power of Jehovah 
 And again, I can't find a way to get this out in rhymes 
 Other than to say the Lord our God has paid the fines>
