All you've been searchin' and lookin' in all the wrong places 
 Search no more. Love is here. 
 Hey I had to write this song 'cause the masses are mistaken 
 They've confused the word love with infatuation 
 Its sad 'cause when we lackin love the wrong path is taken 
 They missing out 'cause getting true love is past amazing 
 It's more than a passing statement, a short lasting craving 
 It ain't refusing not to wait, it ain't mad impatience 
 Some been tryna find love in that guy or gal they dating 
 And before long they hormones are fastly raging 
 Yeah true love is a must, but that ain't love, it's lustin' 
 Love would never ask you to ungodly stuff 
 Its honest plus, it ain't wrong and hard to trust 
 Its everlasting and can't happen when the heart's corrupt 
 Resting on false love you must realized you'll plummet 
 'Cause real love is much more than butterflies in ya stomach 
 Most of us are out of line 'cause really the bottom line 
 Is we looking for love but ain't sure what we tryna find 
 You tried the pleasures of this world but still there's something missing 
 'Cause when you close your eyes at night you can feel your heart still searching 
 I know you tired of being let down so you look for love in all the wrong places 
 So search no more 'cause it's the life of Christ your soul's been missing 
 We must learn that love is perfect, it never will fail 
 I'm ready to tell, its needed and forever prevails 
 It's so glorious, I'm sure we need some more its true 
 The world's confused and seems to have a distorted view 
 Most think love's a sweet kiss, a nice statement in time 
 But don't know that love is sacred, its patient and kind 
 It's not filled with sinful jealousy, doesn't brag and boast 
 It's priceless and can't be bought with a stack of dough 
 It's so true. It's not rude. It doesn't seek its own 
 It's selfless, I'm telling this because we need to know 
 It's not easily angered, keeps no record of wrongs 
 It forgives, it's a blessing and forever is strong 
 It don't delight in evil but it likes the truth 
 It's liberating never fading and it's righteous too 
 I'd like for you to put love first in here 
 It always protects, always trusts, hopes, and perseveres 
 You tried the pleasures of this world but still there's something missing 
 'Cause when you close your eyes at night you can feel your heart still searching 
 I know you tired of being let down so you look for love in all the wrong places 
 So search no more 'cause it's the life of Christ your soul's been missing 
 I can't stress enough the fact that love will never end 
 It's eternal better than this other stuff so let it in 
 Such an unusual experience beyond expression 
 We need it, we gotta seek it, yeah love is a blessin' 
 Utter perfection, but something most guys will lack 
 So the remaining real question's, "Where you find it at?" 
 I know you wondering if you don't wanna die and miss love 
 Seek Christ, 'cause the Bible says that GOD is Love 
 For GOD so loved the world, HE would redeem you and me 
 Yeah it was love that made HIM bleed and cling to a tree 
 That's the truth, so without the SON you losing 
 HE shows love and for that there's no substitution 
 We try to fill the void with things of all sorts 
 But let us stop settling for things that fall short 
 HE can be the lover of our souls turn now to Christ 
 Lookin' for love? Well true love is found in Christ 
 You tried the pleasures of this world but still there's something missing 
 'Cause when you close your eyes at night you can feel your heart still searching 
 I know you tired of being let down so you lookin' for love in all the wrong places 
 So search no more, 'cause it's the life of Christ your soul's been missing 
 You tried the pleasures of this world but still there's something missing 
 'Cause when you close your eyes at night you can feel your heart still searching 
 I know you tired of being let down so you lookin' for love in all the wrong places 
 So search no more, 'cause it's the life of Christ your soul's been missing
