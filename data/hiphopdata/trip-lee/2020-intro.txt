Open them ears up bro we bout to put you on 
 To something special, to bless you I hope it's hitting home 
 I know you skeptical bet you just tryna flip the song 
 You used to different spitting bout women and living wrong 
 But what you know about the Lord? We tryna see Him clear 
 How to appease Him and please Him, how can we keep Him near 
 How can we know Him, behold Him, and show Him we sincere 
 Is he opposed to you posin, smokin', and drinkin' beer? 
 I'm hoping we prepared, we 'bout a take a trip 
 I'll point you to the living water homie take a sip 
 Go to the pool of Siloam go on and take a dip 
 Come back with vision that's given by Him who makes a switch 
 Though it would it cost Him, His enemies would cross Him 
 He called, and was dropping that knowledge like books falling 
 Dallas to New Orleans, Philly to every city 
 Our vision is looking blurred we gotta see 20/20 
 Got ears but don't hear, got eyes but don't see 
 Our God we don't fear, these rhymes are so we 
 Can peak off into the mind of God, He's holy 
 Our lives are so weak, but God is so heap 
 Yeah He's perfect and flawless, He stands as the standard 
 His stance is grand, understand that He stands up 
 Always upright, we got a chance since the ransom 
 He paid at the cross, now let's find us some answers 
 What kind of God, would take some dudes and hand em 
 Eternal life for free, through the grace that He grants them? 
 By faith, we been changed, used to roll as His foes 
 But He rose and He chose, now we clothed in His clothes 
 It's kinda crazy, we all had ambitions of getting dough 
 He changed our character like an actor who's switching roles 
 This is to testify 'bout the God that we living for 
 And I'm just hoping this album will help you get to know Him
