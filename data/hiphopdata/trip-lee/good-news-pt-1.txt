Well let me tell you how it started in the Garden of Eden 
 With sweet Adam and Eve the first hearts beatin' 
 God made them in his image till they ate from the tree and... 
 Since then all men have been born as heathens 
 We have a sickness like people who can't beat diseases 
 It's called sin it deserves the eternal heat 
 He gave us life and we can keep it I'll tell you the reason 
 But first let's get back to the massacre at Eden 
 The very first time man was tricked by Satan 
 On that date and that day instantly changed our fate 
 It was undoubtedly man's darkest hour 
 But Eve didn't have a chance she didn't know his power 
 We probably would have failed too if the choice was ours 
 It's a dilemma that man alone can't get out of 
 'Cause our relationship with the holy God is sour 
 We all fall short of him like He's tall as towers 
 Instead staying with the one with the awesome power 
 We steady chasing girls like Austin Powers 
 We're all left out in the cold in a world that's crowded 
 With skeptics and doubters who want to do without Him 
 We got a problem, We need something to solve it now 'cause 
 We're separated from the father and we're lost without Him 
 We got a problem, We need something to solve it now 'cause 
 We're separated from the father and we're lost without Him, that's... 
 The bad news, we were born in sin 
 The good news we can be born again 
 The bad news, we were born in sin 
 The good news, we can be born again
