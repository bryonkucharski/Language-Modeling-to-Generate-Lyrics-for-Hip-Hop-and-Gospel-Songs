Some folks gone call us insane 'cause we don't spit to get change 
 No grills, chains or big rings that just ain't how we live, man 
 We ain't worried 'bout no big fame WE tryina lift up his name 
 They think Trip deranged 'cause I got a whip but I don't care to grip grain 
 We ain't hollin at no groupies we them dudes who be 
 Livin' right givin' Christ all we got truly 
 Some started to exclude me when the saw the new me 
 And I tried to tell 'em God is watchin like a movie 
 Naw we don't need no chix boy we found a way to get joy 
 Even though we get Outkast like Andre and Big Boi 
 We ain't gotta be them rich boys ain't gotta be them fly dudes 
 Nope. this ain't no lie dude. I wish you knew what I do 
 It don't phase us 'cause we claim to be aliens and strangers 
 Cats liftin his name up and telling folks he saved us 
 We strayed from our sinful ways naw dawg we can't have it 
 Think we crazy for it? Gone throw us in them straight jackets 
 Oh yeah they talk down, oh yeah they call us crazy 
 'Cause we don't walk around tryna be no ballas baby 
 We praise the Son of Man they think we crazy dawg 
 'Cause they don't understand so we just shake it off 
 Oh yeah they talk down, oh yeah they call us crazy 
 'Cause we don't walk around tryna be no ballas baby 
 We imitatin Christ he's more than holy dude 
 He's what we need in life. man, if they only knew 
 (Lemme get some, lemme talk to em) 
 Now you talk noise and walk hard but we was dogs like junk yards 
 Our hearts hard got you callin me crazy like Joe Clark 
 I know dawg, it seems off; we don't talk about cash signs 
 Or bad dimes, pointin makin' comments on her backside 
 You as blind as Venetians chasin treat like Tahitians 
 And sin got you mixed up just like Blacks and Polynesians 
 So you front on me and when I'm round you run from me you done with me 
 But when the Lord comes for me you gone want his company 
 I'll pull yo card like a magic trick. in sin you fell like a tragic slip 
 The Lord will not be mocked; when it comes to sin, he ain't havin' it. 
 So when we grab the mic and flame it it's just to spit the spark 
 And fix your heart I don't care if I'm Mr. 106&Park 
 So y'all can keep the fame and groupies and even the famous groupies. 
 I don't need 'em I got Jesus the reason I'm even breathin 
 So say what you wanna say you can call this a phase for me 
 But through sin I had a debt that he graciously paid for me 
 Oh yeah they talk down, oh yeah they call us crazy 
 'Cause we don't walk around tryna be no ballas baby 
 We praise the Son of Man they think we crazy dawg 
 'Cause they don't understand so we just shake it off 
 Oh yeah they talk down, oh yeah they call us crazy 
 'Cause we don't walk around tryna be no ballas baby 
 We imitatin Christ he's more than holy dude 
 He's what we need in life. man, if they only knew 
 Some folks don't understand us why we hold to a standard 
 It's Christians that witness they don't get the picture like broke cameras 
 When we walk around they talk down but Christ we gone act dude 
 And we see the cross is good for more than an ice piece and a tattoo 
 They think we out our minds dawg 'cause we don't love and embrace lust 
 But we've been cleaned like Lysol so in the Son we place trust 
 We shake the dust off our shoes if they don't receive the good news 
 We tryna tell to get 'em outta hell suburban cats to the hood dudes 
 They look at us with crazy looks from H-town to D-town 
 But we don't care we free now got Jesus in our freestyles 
 They mock us and laugh but they don't know the half 
 They don't know about why we souled out and so devout for our dad 
 If they only knew about Jesus how he cleaned and redeemed us 
 They too would be teachers that's why we gotta speak up 
 We can't keep it inside that Jesus Christ can free you 
 You could be known as his Robin until they know what we do they gone talk down 
 Oh yeah they talk down, oh yeah they call us crazy 
 'Cause we don't walk around tryna be no ballas baby 
 We praise the Son of Man they think we crazy dawg 
 'Cause they don't understand so we just shake it off 
 Oh yeah they talk down, oh yeah they call us crazy 
 'Cause we don't walk around tryna be no ballas baby 
 We imitatin Christ he's more than holy dude 
 He's what we need in life. man, if they only knew
