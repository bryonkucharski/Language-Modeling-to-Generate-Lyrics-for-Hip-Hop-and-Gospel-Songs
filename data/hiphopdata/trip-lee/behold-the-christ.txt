Hey yo, waddup? 
 Dis ya boy Mac 
 Mac the doulos supplyin' da track 
 Yeah, got my man's Trip Lee on the verse 
 We had to team up 
 Let cat's know the truth about Jesus the Christ 
 Not just a prophet, not just a man 
 He's God in da flesh 
 A O Trip, get 'at 'em 
 Let 'em know! 
 There's one who stands who can save a man from hell 
 I thought you heard the incarnate word, Emmanuel 
 Not the bishop, God with us why can't you tell (that) 
 He's 100% God and all man as well 
 No illusion, God became man for real 
 To remain perfect in a sinful land that's ill 
 He came through to return how a man would kneel 
 And now tongues will confess the lamb is real 
 The word became flesh put on skin and blood 
 Was perfect, right though his death when they spilled his blood 
 No room for a pregnant servant who was highly favored 
 That in her womb deserved worship, the righteous savior 
 He was the right guy to save 'em, and they was clearly wretched 
 But is fortelling to the fact that people here will reject him 
 We should fear and rest in Him, surely bless Him 
 Born of a virgin, which made for a pure conception 
 How fittin', Mary will now birth the Son 
 What a beautiful baby, Jesus the perfect one 
 An infant but the second standing in the trinity 
 But get this, both humanity and divinity 
 Now I'm a soldier standing up in His infantry 
 The slain lamb, great man who delivered me 
 The King that put every bit of strength in me 
 He is savior, creator, exact representation of His nature 
 He is more than just a man, He is God in the flesh 
 Made like us now in His grace we can rest, He is the Christ 
 He is savior, creator, exact representation of His nature 
 He is more than just a man, He is God in the flesh 
 Made like us now in His grace we can rest 
 Behold the Christ 
 Please excuse me, I must shoot the truth to dudes 
 Even though it’s bout confusin as rubics cubes 
 How the Creator wrapped Himself in human flesh 
 To be booed, persecuted and bruised to death 
 Now you can rest on Jesus and His savin grace 
 And be truly blessed, He came to take our place 
 But some of us so called believers take an awkward stance 
 And deny the doctrine that He was God and man 
 And don’t believe in Christ as Creator of man from dust 
 Why should we trust Him if He was just a man like us? 
 And tell me this, if Christ was not God with men 
 Then how did he manage to live apart from sin? 
 With no flaws within, and here’s the major test 
 When the last time you seen a man raise from death? 
 I know, never/ Its impossible unless of course 
 Jesus Christ was God in the flesh and Lord 
 Further proof that Jesus is one with God 
 Hebrews 1, the Father refers to the Son as God 
 I could go on for days with this scriptural proof 
 Cause this aint just my opinion, its biblical truth 
 Plus, its one of the core essentials of the faith 
 Somethin we must believe if we some Christians and we saved 
 If we don’t believe this, then we denyin the Bible 
 And we believe in a different Christ, our God is an idol 
 He is savior, creator, exact representation of His nature 
 He is more than just a man, He is God in the flesh 
 Made like us now in His grace we can rest, He is the Christ 
 He is savior, creator, exact representation of His nature 
 He is more than just a man, He is God in the flesh 
 Made like us now in His grace we can rest 
 Behold the Christ 
 Look I don’t think we quite comprehend the concept 
 The kinda lavish paradise the Son left 
 For the kinda rejection He would come get 
 On the cross, breath in His lungs, it was none left 
 Was it love? Yes, but nonetheless 
 There still wasn’t a place for the Son to rest 
 Not only through leavin Heaven was His love expressed 
 But God the Son in flesh, Christ, would come and step 
 On Earth, the coldest place/ He showed His grace 
 Then died, but His life didn’t go to waste 
 Was rich and more than comfortable, but he made 
 Himself poor with grace 
 He was made for a lil' while lower than angels 
 But some still don’t embrace Him, He’s longin to save ya 
 And if He does He’s unashamed to call ya brother 
 Cause we got the same Father, its God above us 
 In everyway He made Himself like us 
 Was even tested main, yet remained righteous 
 We cant complain and say He cant relate to us 
 Cause He was made just like the ones He made from dust 
 Faithful to us, died as propitiation 
 Quenched His wrath and took a load off depraved men 
 But don’t be fooled like Satan had the Son in defeat 
 Cause now He sits on the throne with all under His feet
