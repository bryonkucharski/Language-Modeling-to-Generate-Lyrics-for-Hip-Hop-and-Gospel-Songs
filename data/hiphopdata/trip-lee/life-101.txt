Listen 
 Now I'dn heard a lota he say she say in my life in time 
 And the days keep rollin', no replay I wanna be sure to live it right 
 'Cause I want that (want that) need that (need that) 
 And if it's real homie, I can't believe that 
 So if you help me find which way should I go with my life 
 My homie said you gotta live for the moment 
 On this earth you never know how long you on it 
 Gotta get a goal you don't wanna say you blown it 
 (Don it?) Seem like you should get it if you want it 
 My other homie said life is a vapour 
 A breath, better not waste it tryna chase paper 
 Cancer, cash and your slacks in the grave ya 
 Done for can't no body save ya, thank ya 
 My homie said life's a game you gotta play right 
 No script, write your own story like a playwright 
 It's no fate right? You just gotta face life 
 Give or take never make the same mistake twice 
 I heard the sayin' life's a gift you gotta use well 
 Choose well, 'cause we seen a lotta dudes fail 
 True but when you do turn get a new trail 
 The old juice fail drink from a new well

 My homie said life sucks then it's over 
 It's so rough so you gotta roll with a toaster 
 Silver spoon, no sir, mob like soldiers 
 Tight but you can't make so what, hold up 
 My other homie said life can be stiff man 
 Its bland, till you gotta hope that can withstand 
 Its grand if you gotcha eyes on the big plan 
 Keep watch don't let it take you out like a hitman 
 My homie said you gotta look for that great stuff 
 Can't just live ordinary for the Saviour 
 God wants to bless me, I should step my faith up 
 He loves me enough that He'll keep me from that pain, bruh 
 My other homie said God wants to bless you 
 And yes you should call upon His name for your rescue 
 He'll give you all you need, here's the Son He accepts you 
 You might need tests through trials to correct you

 Now should I follow what you say, or should I come up with my own way 
 What you say they tell me, I'm lookin' for advice man that will never fail me 
 I got questions, so confused now, hopin you don't let me down 
 If only there was somebody who had it all figured out 
 Yeah that would give me strength no doubt 
 Yeah 
 Look man my Lord said that He made life 
 Night to the day light, from the same Christ 
 Lose your life for His sake, and you save life 
 Birth don't mean nothing if it ain't twice (twice) 
 My Lord said He came this earth so He gave life 
 Can't quite aim high enough to match His great life 
 Man we ain't right, turn to His great might 
 Life is eternal through faith right? Right
