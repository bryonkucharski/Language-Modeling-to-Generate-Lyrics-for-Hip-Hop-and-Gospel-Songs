(Verse 1 - Trip Lee) 
 Hey I was raised in that Lone Star State where we go hard 
 Can't do it small at all, 'cause big things are at stake 
 My dreams as a buck was to make a large bank 
 Daddy told me the best, no one can tell me I can't 
 Be the best baller, or be the best rapper 
 Got a little older and went after the latter 
 Grind till I shine, tryna climb that ladder 
 Grab a couple girls 'cause your boy look dapper 
 But at a young age, I saw I had it wrong 
 Full of drive, but moving in reverse all along 
 Dreams full of pride, heart full of stone 
 You know I had to redefine what I grind on 
 Success is dangerous, if you don't do it right 
 He gave us everything for pointing to him right 
 So toast to the King who gave me some new dreams 
 Everything for his name, that's how I do things 
 (Chorus - J.R.) 
 Never knew how lost I was till I found out 
 That I couldn't hear his voice, it was drowned out 
 I was just chasing things, selfish dreams 
 Now I see what he has for me, it's the good life 
 (Verse 2 - Sho Baraka) 
 I grew up with those Dodgers and those Angels 
 Where wings get mangled and they rock a broken halo 
 Success is an idol from Hollywood to Diego 
 No hablo if you don't speak with the pesos 
 And their favorite dollar sign is too much 
 More greed, more lust, more taste, more touch 
 I had an appetite that ate from the Devil's power 
 At every bite to see the rise, I'm kissing my life goodbye 
 If I find I have a need this world cannot meet 
 Then I know this life is a place where my hope should not be 
 I've been chasing those things that are real fake 
 This is not a real place, this is a dream state 
 Functional saviors ain't hip, they're a real waste 
 What's the palace gon' offer that a manger can't? 
 Pain, sorrow, and empty treasures 
 Spite the Creator, and deem creation simply better 
 The world offers a lot of things but it's really lying 
 And to the Lord, the good life is really dying 
 I'm the Lord's possession so my heart's in the heavens 
 True Religion in my jeans and stop guessing 
 (Chorus - J.R.) 
 Never knew how lost I was till I found out 
 That I couldn't hear his voice, it was drowned out 
 I was just chasing things, selfish dreams 
 Now I see what he has for me, it's the good life 
 (Verse 3 - Trip Lee) 
 Even the sun goes down, heroes die eventually 
 Great careers end in the industry 
 Empires implode, you may go down in history 
 But everything will go down eventually 
 Look, yeah you could stack bread, but you can't stop death 
 And there won't be no comfort offered you in that bed 
 All get laid out, the games get played out 
 In a maze headed to the grave and there's no way out 
 You can't outlast life, it fades out fast 
 Death is coming for us all, everything gon' pass 
 So look at it from that angle, dag 
 My dreams gotta be bigger and greater than that 
 How is it persecuted martyrs in Asia 
 Were living out their dreams though they was walking in danger? 
 Their dreams are what lifted up the heart of the Savior 
 And living in a way to show that's what they wait for 
 They wasn't stackin' up the cake, but was walking in favor 
 Living a good life because they want with the Maker 
 My dreams are different, you know that I've been changed now 
 The good life is the life that's been laid down 
 (Outro - J.R.) 
 The good life 
 Yeah it's the good life 
 The good life 
 Yeah it's the good life
