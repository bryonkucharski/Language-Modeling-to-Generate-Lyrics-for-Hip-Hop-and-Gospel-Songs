My girlfriend's name starts with an "I" 
 Shines bright like stars in the sky 
 Stays by my side, when it's dark, she the light 
 She befriends many and we get lost in her eyes 
 Staring at her 'stead of watching our steps 
 Run to her when we wake without catching our breath 
 She's addicting ... the truth: we're fiends 
 But we ain't sniffing glue, we just glued to the screens 
 She rules us, see the proof when she rings 
 Probably take two of her over two human beings 
 Her sisters, some bigger, some smaller 
 Sync her with them daily to keep her in order 
 Get her when she drops even if we can't afford her 
 Ask me if I really need her, I'd be like, "sorta" 
 But when I seen her at the mall, had to court her 
 I keep her in accessories, your boy do spoil her 
 I want her in my life, I'd do anything for her 
 Forget about a dime boy, she more like a quarter 
 With her all the time, there ain't nobody cooler 
 See her, little jealous man, and I don't wanna lose her 
 So instead of spending time with others 
 She only lets me talk when I talk through her 
 But iLove 
 But still I, still iLove 
 I love her 
 I love her so much, I don't need nobody else 
 Try to put her down, but can't help myself 
 ILove 
 C'mon, you know I'm in iLove 
 I love her 
 I love her so much, I don't need nobody else 
 Try to put her down, but can't help myself 
 She's really affecting how my life goes 
 She controls me, I might go psycho 
 I can't think now, mental light bulb 
 Weighty thoughts are pushed out by her light shows 
 Community's gotta take a back seat 
 I try to talk to others, but I'm feeling mad weak 
 There's always something I can laugh at, something I can look up 
 She keeps me entertained till I barely ever look up 
 And when I try to get up in the text 
 She's tapping on my shoulder, to read another text 
 Look, I thought she'd really be the best 
 I told her she a heavy ball and chain around my neck 
 She got mad like, "You got a better date?" 
 I had to man up, time to regulate 
 Look, I told her if she ain't gon' let me meditate 
 Then for my sake, we gotta separate 
 Don't wanna hurt her, I don't wanna abuse her 
 But she's only there for me to use her 
 ILove 
 You know this is iLove 
 I love her 
 I love her so much, I don't need nobody else 
 Try to put her down, but can't help myself 
 ILove 
 You know this is iLove 
 I love her so much, I don't need nobody else 
 But I gotta put her down just to help myself
