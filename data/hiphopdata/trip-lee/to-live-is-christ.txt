Brethren listen to this exposition 
 Paul wrote the Philippians some lessons for living (1:1) 
 Written to them but its real good text for Christians 
 Read it closely, hope we can catch the vision 
 Chapter 1 he tells them he's blessed to get them 
 Co-laboring with him to serve the best who's risen (1:5, 7) 
 And that's he's confident the Lord will perfect in Christians 
 What He started and hearts will be corrected in them (1:6) 
 Listen, he was in prison now maybe never getting out 
 But all he could think about was the gospel getting out (1:12-14) 
 Some was even preaching Christ for selfish motives 
 Coming at Paul but dawg he shrugged his shoulders (1:15-18) 
 His focus was Christ the Messiah man (1:19) 
 And for Him "to live is Christ and to die was gain" (1:20,21) 
 Yeah, he was hard pressed, but to remain in the flesh 
 Was more necessary so they faith would progress (1:22-24) 
 He wanted them to strive together for the gospel 
 In one spirit, one mind, listen to the apostle (1:27) 
 Maintain the same love, uplift your brothers 
 Don't just look out for yourself, but for the interests of others (2:2-4) 
 Our life is nothing, but Christ is all (1:21) 
 So conduct yourselves worthy of His righteous call (1:27) 
 Our life is nothing, but Christ is all (1:21) 
 So conduct yourselves worthy of His righteous call (1:27) 
 Our life is nothing, but Christ is all (1:21) 
 So conduct yourselves worthy of His righteous call (1:27) 
 Our life is nothing, but Christ is all (1:21) 
 So conduct yourselves worthy of His righteous call (1:27) 
 Let's examine five through eleven 
 The blessed lamb who resided in the Heavens (2:6) 
 Said forget the wealth and emptied Himself 
 Came as a man and he died for the brethren (2:7,8) 
 Ultimate obedience, he died on the cross and (2:8) 
 Through His humility Christ was exalted (2:9) 
 Glory to the Father (2:11), now we should have 
 That same attitude Christ Jesus had (2:5) 
 And on to verse twelve work out your salvation (2:12) 
 The Father works in us in this process of saving (2:13) 
 Avoid dispute and prove yourself blameless 
 Children of God in a perverse generation (2:14,15) 
 Cling to the bible, humility is vital 
 We see it in lives of Paul and his disciples (2:17-30) 
 Serving him like father (2:22), some fellow soldiers (2:25) 
 Let us rejoice, unite, and rep Jehovah 
 Rejoice in the Lord we serve (3:1) 
 And forget about the flesh we nothing more than dirt (3:3) 
 Man if anyone could brag bout they status it was Paul 
 But to him it was trash it and he counted it as loss 
 For the sake of the Christ, 'cause He gave us life (3:4-7) 
 Not through anything we did but through faith in Christ (3:9) 
 We righteous in the eyes of the Lord's that's blessing 
 Conformed to His death and His resurrection (3:9-10) 
 Brethren, I don't claim to have attained perfection's 
 What he said but was reaching to what lies ahead (3:12-13) 
 And encouraged the Philippians to model what he said (3:15) 
 And not to walk in the flesh cause that walk is dead (3:17-19) 
 But we citizens of Heaven who eagerly wait for 
 The one that we rest in Jesus our Savior (3:20) 
 That's who the Lord is and He will surely 
 Transform our bodies in future glory (3:21) 
 He closes encouraging with words 
 In unity and harmony for those within the church (4:1-3) 
 Rejoice in the Lord, bro our hopes in Him first (4:4) 
 Let our thanks and our problems be known to Him first (4:6) 
 Embrace the peace of God, you can bet on that (4:7) 
 And whatever is good let your mind dwell on that (4:8) 
 Then he thanked them again, for they gifts and concern (4:10) 
 But no matter what to be content he had learned (4:11-12) 
 Plus he was sure that he could do all things 
 Through Him who gave strength and can do all things (4:13) 
 And he told them they did well sharing through all pain (4:14) 
 And made sure they knew he sure he wasn't trying to get more change (4:15-18) 
 God will supply all they needs he hoped they might see this 
 According to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus (4:19) 
 The truth of Philippians I hope it hit you 
 And may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you (4:23) 
 I hope you like what you heard with me rapping these verses 
 But don't get it twisted, we just scratching the surface 
 There's more to be learned than this rap is saying 
 So read it, live it, learn it like the back of your hand
