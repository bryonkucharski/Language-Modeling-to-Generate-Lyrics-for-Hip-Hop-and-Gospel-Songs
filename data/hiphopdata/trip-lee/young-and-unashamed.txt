Hey when they see ya boy, what's they first impression? 
 Probably not a teen redeemed from the worst transgressions 
 That's repented from the path of His first ancestors 
 Was cursed but since rebirth this person's dressed in 
 The glorious righteousness of Christ 
 They probably think I'm on the stage 'cause I like the mic 
 Or like to get hype, but really I'm laid back main 
 But sometimes could lose my mind if you say that name 
 (Who?) Jehohah Jireh, my soul's provider 
 Life without Him's a contradiction like bein' poor with Prada 
 I done wrote a lot of flows, in my soul's a fire 
 That shut up in my bones, ah my soul desire 
 Is for some slick guys to the know the Lord He died 
 But still the Son did rise like it was mornin' time 
 So if you think you fully satisfied wit a vette wit chrome 
 You better check yourself like playin' chess alone 
 I'm a stranger, is Earth really my residence? Nope 
 I'm a alien and I can't wait to rest at home 
 My dress ain't always fresh to def I ain't impressed wit clothes 
 But Christ, He's the key to life dog and death's the door (and rebirth) 
 Since the moment I believed, my flesh was broke 
 Sin lost its control and death its hold 
 So maybe now you'll understand and get up in ya brain 
 Why ya boy so young and unashamed 
 They don't associate ya boy wit Christ Jesus kid 
 'Cause I got my hat cocked and my jeans is big 
 No suit and tie, tall tees and kicks 
 But you ain't gotta be a geek to preach that Jesus lives 
 So its almost strange when they see me hit tha street blocks 
 'Cause with my life I copy Christ like a Xerox 
 No heat cocked, I roll wit the Lord and 
 Wit a team full of Saints like I play for New Orleans 
 We hold each other accountable when seekin' sound doctrine 
 Through Christ we been found not guilty without Cochran 
 We kingdom people selected to rep His name 
 Forget bout cheddar main, Christ is the better thing 
 I don't let no weapon hang, I don't roll wit thugs 
 That's holdin' drugs and spendin all they dough in clubs 
 I roll wit a gang of believers that's crazy for Jesus 
 That's saved from the flames and unashamed of His teachings 
 Cats be like, "You just a baby, how you know about the Lord?" 
 To know Jehovah at His core we had to open up our swords 
 We read His word on a daily, His inspired text 
 And submit to the Spirit dog, we died to flesh 
 I confess, they tell us that our youth is bein wasted 
 Instead of jewels up in a bracelet, we speak truth each time we make hits 
 So maybe now its stuck up in ya brain 
 Why the 116 is so young and unashamed 
 Cats don't really understand, they think I lost my mind 
 They hood on they back, but I rock a cross on mine 
 Walk wit Christ in light, blood bought plus I'm 
 Not dark as night, I'm light because I sought His shine 
 I was livin' for today, was always caught in crimes 
 Bout guilty as O.J., my talk and walk declined 
 The Boss of time and space, but I put that to rest man 
 I saw my old life, it wasn't right like my left hand 
 Now He orders my steps and with Him is how I walk bro 
 Got off the highway to Hell and I took the cross roads 
 Now I'm walkin' with Christ, what beautiful thing 
 Its cooler than fame, more precious than jewelry and chains 
 Most think God is just old school like Kool and the Gang 
 They wanna be like Jeezy, Jay-Z and Ludacris main 
 But I'm here today to say that if you want a greater day 
 Don't fade away, cling to Christ and His amazing savin' grace 
 If you a Christian who accepted the King and you clean 
 We gotta move, the Lord is pleased when we play on His team 
 I hope young believers understand, I pray its in ya brain 
 If we love the Lord we must be young and unashamed
