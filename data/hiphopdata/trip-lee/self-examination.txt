Yeah 
 Ay wat it do 
 It's ya boy Trip Lee man 
 Yeah you can ride to this 
 Ay man but while you ridin' to it 
 Listen to the words homie 
 Yeah we can't just go through life chillin' man 
 We gotta stop and examine ourselves 
 Let me tell you what I'm sayin' 
 Yeah we was born sinners man, dead in the flesh 
 Unfamiliar with the Lord's livin' man, He bled to the death 
 But we love our sin instead of Him, we fans of the flesh 
 If you think I'm lyin' man, put a man to the test 
 We all full of lies, full of pride, full of dirty lust 
 And we put our lives ahead of God's Word we should trust 
 We all knew it was a dude above who made everything 
 But we run a way, love our ways, and never gave Him praise 
 But for some of us He made a way up out of this dilemma 
 He sent His Son, and he was strung out for wicked sinners 
 Now all we gotta do is trust upon the righteousness of Christ 
 And He got something new for us (What?), the righteousness of Christ 
 You may believe it man, but have you trusted in Him yet? 
 And realized your sinful life will thrust you into death? 
 And that you need Him cause in the flesh man is fadin 
 Time for self examination like you was the Dr and the patient 
 We gotta look ourselves over 
 Have we standing with Jehovah 
 He's the man and He can hold us 
 You'll be standing as His soldier 
 Its time for self examination, we need a self examination 
 Its time for self examination, we need a self examination man 
 What are lives look like 
 Cause fo real we should fight 
 To enjoy lifting Christ 
 And to shine His good light 
 Its time for self examination, we need a self examination 
 Its time for self examination, we need a self examination man 
 A lot of us claim to be believers but we slack in our walk 
 And we goin' around everyday without our backs to the cross 
 And when it comes to servin' Christ, we standin on the wall 
 But we say we Christian 'cause we went up for the altar call 
 That don't mean that we believers, that don't mean we saved from flames 
 If we ain't workin for Him our faith is dead like it say in James 
 If it ain't no better livin', we the same and steady sinnin 
 Just know that faith without fruit wasn't faith from the beginnin 
 It's a lot of kids that got it twisted thinking they saved 
 But homie they ain't bout tha Fathers biz they sleep in they graves 
 And they gon be real disappointed man when they face judgement 
 And all along they though that they was saved, but they really wasn't 
 Sin's disgusting to the Father man, he can barely stand it 
 And the mark of the believer is keeping to His commandments 
 So if we content up in our sin, ain't seekin' Jesus 
 We really need to 'cause we may not even be believers 
 We gotta look ourselves over 
 Have we standing with Jehovah 
 He's the man and He can hold us 
 You'll be standing as His soldier 
 Its time for self examination, we need a self examination 
 Its time for self examination, we need a self examination man 
 What are lives look like 
 Cause fo real we should fight 
 To enjoy lifting Christ 
 And to shine His good light 
 Its time for self examination, we need a self examination 
 Its time for self examination, we need a self examination man 
 Now for some of us we claim to be in love with our God 
 But if we look around we can find that something is odd 
 And if we really look our love for the Son isn't thick 
 'Cause we ain't really in love with Christ, we in love with His gifts 
 Man after you die and you gon and you go to Heaven 
 Would you be satisfied if you arrived and God wasn't present? 
 That's a question we should ask, are we choosin' Christ? 
 Is he just a supplement, or is He our true delight? Holla at me 
 See most of the times what happens is 
 We just goin' through life thinkin' that everything is great, 
 Thinkin' everything is all good 
 Not stoppin' and lookin', How we doin', Where we stand with our God 
 See we gotta stop and look to see if we made a decision to accept Christ 
 If we really trusted in Christ and His righteousness 
 And if we really in love with this God 
 Its time to examine ourselves 
 We gotta look ourselves over 
 Have we standing with Jehovah 
 He's the man and He can hold us 
 You'll be standing as His soldier 
 Its time for self examination, we need a self examination 
 Its time for self examination, we need a self examination man 
 What are lives look like 
 Cause fo real we should fight 
 To enjoy lifting Christ 
 And to shine His good light 
 Its time for self examination, we need a self examination 
 Its time for self examination, we need a self examination man
