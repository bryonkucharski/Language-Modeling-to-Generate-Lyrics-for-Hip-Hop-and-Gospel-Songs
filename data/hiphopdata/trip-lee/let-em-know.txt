First lets spit the truth 
 Then pray the spirit moves 
 Let's serve Him in our youth 
 We gotta let 'em know 
 Let's tell 'em they missin' Him and that they sick in sin 
 Get they attention then 
 We gotta let 'em know 
 Hey let's come and bring the word of the one that runs this thing 
 We young and unashamed 
 We gotta let 'em know 
 Let's represent the king 
 Let's help 'em miss the flames 
 Since they think this a game 
 We gotta let 'em know 
 Hey Anywhere that we go 
 We gotta let them boys know 
 Why we speak, why we flow 
 What we got all this joy for? 
 Who we makin' noise for? 
 Dog it's a automatic answer 
 All believers gotta stand up 
 From Dallas down to Atlanta 
 Jehovah Nissi the banner 
 Who saved us from Satan's slander 
 Get yo hands up 
 He's comin' hear all us holla Hosanna 
 We all will follow commandments 
 In honor to God we stand with 
 His word/ A new brand of folks tryna follow his standards 
 We could be around some thugs 
 All packin all hostile 
 We still Christian, we ain't trippin' 
 Run up on 'em with the gospel 
 We could be up in the mall 
 But we ain't tryna ball 
 We tryna tell 'em only Christ can cure the sickness of the fall 
 We Christians standin tall 
 We listen to His call 
 We love Him so much that we celebratin' Christmas in the fall 
 So it ain't no thing 
 We ain't scared to say 
 That we gon share our faith 
 Yeah we gon let 'em know 
 First lets spit the truth

 Let's help 'em miss the flames 
 Since they think this a game 
 We gotta let 'em know 
 So if you saved and taken out of your sin 
 Then you've received the Holy Spirits power within 
 Now you can read the bible and see how He can send 
 Some girls and guys alive in Christ to tell all about Him 
 But now you gotta learn the facts so you can tell other guys 
 How we don't deserve jack but Christ said He'd come and die 
 Rose back up in the sky 
 We some heathens its true 
 But we don't never have to die if we believe in this dude 
 We can spread it where you live 
 We can mess with them first 
 But after we done with them we hit the rest of the earth 
 It ain't the best of your works 
 The thing to save you is Jesus 
 We tryna let His word spread like contagious diseases 
 He saves who He pleases and He uses us 
 All His saints, His believers to move this stuff 
 So we gon let Him use us 
 Tell 'em what the truth does 
 And we gon show some dudes love 
 Yeah we gon let 'em know 
 First lets spit the truth 
 Then pray the spirit moves 
 Let's serve Him in our youth 
 We gotta let 'em know 
 Let's tell 'em they missin' Him and that they sick in sin 
 Get they attention then 
 We gotta let 'em know 
 Hey let's come and bring the word of the one that runs this thing 
 We young and unashamed 
 We gotta let 'em know 
 Let's represent the king 
 Let's help 'em miss the flames 
 Since they think this a game 
 We gotta let 'em know 
 I'm tryna hit 'em with the truth 
 So they can get a better glimpse 
 The remotest part too 
 We tryna hit every inch 
 It's the gospel 
 Not only does it make better sense 
 But the only way to Heaven's through the one that's Heaven sent 
 Jesus Christ 
 And we won't stop dude 
 Until He got you 
 Not just the burbs but the hoods and the blocks too 
 Its no qualifications 
 They can be part of the flock too 
 All they need is faith 
 Call on His name is all they gotta do 
 But how can they call on Him if they don't believe 
 And tell me how can they believe if they don't hear nobody preach 
 We ain't gotta do much 
 God's truth is complete 
 Check Romans 10:15 
 We got some beautiful feet 
 He's comin' back 
 If they don't know He died at the cross 
 They gettin' left behind like conerbacks on Moss 
 So we feel a strong burden 
 To tell 'em what the Word did 
 To save us from the furnace 
 We GOTTA let 'em know 
 First lets spit the truth 
 Then pray the spirit moves 
 Let's serve Him in our youth 
 We gotta let 'em know 
 Let's tell 'em they missin' Him and that they sick in sin 
 Get they attention then
