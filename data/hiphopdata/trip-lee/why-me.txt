Look I was born like the rest, from Adam's curse ruined 
 Straight born into death, with my back turned to Him 
 The facts are confusing, I'm a wretched man 
 But He took me, held my hand, and my death was banned 
 He could have let my sins stay and my transgressions stand 
 But I've been selected, elected, predestined man 
 The question stands, look what I do to deserve 
 To be blessed with His plan, made new, and reserved 
 Nothing. I was like the rest, born attracted to death 
 Nah we ain't said it, but its just what all our actions expressed 
 'Cause although I ain't wanna bother with the Lord He spared me 
 When I needed a Father, like orphan Annie 
 He took me in, clothed me in His righteousness 
 Fed me the fruit of the Spirit, now my life is His 
 It's all grace, I don't deserve this relationship 
 'Cause I ain't got nothing to give even my faith was a gift 
 I don't deserve it, I'm worthless, but treated as perfect 
 Why me? Why me? Why me? Why me? 
 I sin more than I wanna, but my sins are a goner 
 Why me? Why me? Why me? Why me? 
 I was lost, but redeemed, then adopted and cleaned 
 Why me? Why me? Why me? Why me? 
 I was a scrub, but this God let me run with His squad 
 Why me? Why me? Why me? Why me? 
 You can ask the question, why our God would let men 
 Take His Son, make Him a naked one just to crush Him 
 We could all inquire, why a God this high up 
 Would stoop so low to scoop a whole crew from holding fire 
 We can pontificate, sipping on lemonade 
 Chilling 'cause our bill of sin was long, but dawg it was paid 
 Or we can shrug it off, not even bug at all 
 Off the fact we should have been attached to that rugged cross 
 That's just what it cost, I'm moved by what it cost 
 Refuse to be like dudes unmoved with thuggish walks 
 They like to disregard this, they like to diss the God that's 
 Coming back never to fade to black like Mr. Carter 
 And it's a shame 'cause the scripture is plain 
 With you and me Yahweh got beef like 50 and Game 
 We're shifty as Cane, only Jesus emptied His veins 
 So now you only got one choice out of a list full of names 
 I don't deserve it, I'm worthless, but treated as perfect 
 Why me? Why me? Why me? Why me? 
 I sin more than I wanna, but my sins are a goner 
 Why me? Why me? Why me? Why me? 
 I was lost, but redeemed, then adopted and cleaned 
 Why me? Why me? Why me? Why me? 
 I was a scrub, but this God let me run with His squad 
 Why me? Why me? Why me? Why me? 
 It's truly His grace that did it all, His righteous mercy 
 Prepared beforehand for glory? Nah I ain't worthy 
 He treated Christ like me and He gave Him death 
 He's treating me like Christ man, He gave me breath 
 I could have easily been one that feening for sin 
 That's leading me in to death and catch heat in the end 
 But He chose me, He showed me, He ordered my steps 
 Man what a privilege to be one of the Lord's elect 
 If it wasn't for you Trip, I wouldn't be tripping on this 
 'Cause we'll get about as far as a car sitting on bricks 
 'Cause why He did it was... Ah forget it 
 I don't know why, I ain't shy I'll admit it 
 So Trip, I don't even question it 
 So I'll go on and rest in this for sin I was in union 
 But now I'm free like a Russian is 
 Now I trust in this [Jesus], now the lesson is 
 Run hard for God to a beat like a percussion is 
 I don't deserve it, I'm worthless, but treated as perfect 
 Why me? Why me? Why me? Why me? 
 I sin more than I wanna, but my sins are a goner 
 Why me? Why me? Why me? Why me? 
 I was lost, but redeemed, then adopted and cleaned 
 Why me? Why me? Why me? Why me? 
 I was a scrub, but this God let me run with His squad 
 Why me? Why me? Why me? Why me?
