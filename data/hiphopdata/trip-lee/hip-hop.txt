For me its about more than spitting silly gritty rhymes 
 Hitting blocks, or getting shot fifty times 
 God's about His glory, so I can't be about getting mines 
 By saying I committed crimes, just lying to get my shine 
 What a tragedy, that that's become the blueprint 
 Spitting bout they renegades, getting weight and move bricks 
 All trying to make dollars and new cents, what a nuisance 
 They call them true, but I'm call them flu- 'cause these dudes sick 
 And they contagious, each time that they throwing up 
 Flows that's more than overstuffed with motives of them blowing up 
 Hoping to get dough, hoping the right doors will open up 
 They focused on it so, they mouths run like motors bruh 
 But get a load of us, we flow with focus up 
 On Jehovah, we soldiers, hoping that folks will notice us 
 But with intentions of pointing them to great Lord 
 That's the reason why we make noise, and represent with great joy 
 Yeah we came to spit, not for chains and chicks 
 But for the King of Kings we praise His name with this 
 And it's just one of many ways, nah we ain't slaves to this 
 Turn on the radio, man I heard it a million times 
 They live it up, and fill they cup they feeling fine 
 They fond of killing, and be chilling with a million dimes 
 It's crazy can't see, but they think they vision's fine 
 And if they ain't blind then I'm crazy and dumb 
 And they must just got they shades on, 'cause they can't see the Son 
 But He gave us sight, made us light, the change has begun 
 From a life that's fast we got to dash like Stacy we done 
 With spitting 'bout the norm, homie yeah we had to switch it up The old- We had to give it up to Christ, and started giving up 
 A life that messed our witness up, the mic- Only for lifting up 
 Christ who let them pin Him up, light of the world this is us 
 Now me and Phish, we be in this and use the music 
 His beats is sick, and me I spit, we use these tunes to 
 Give you truth, I spit in booths, I hope you tuned in 
 Cause this is truth, we living proof, of Jesus moving 
 Yeah we came to spit, not for chains and chicks 
 But for the King of Kings we praise His name with this 
 And it's just one of many ways, nah we ain't slaves to this 
 As you listen, I hope that you don't think this mission's mine 
 This joints for Him, I just point to Him and get behind 
 I hope it's so hot, your jaw drops and you hit rewind 
 But the message is reason I'd be grieved if you missed a line 
 Yeah we love hip hop, and we part of the culture 
 But we ain't just trying to give props, or get it lots of exposure 
 All things only exist so they give props to Jehovah 
 Even this, don't be behind the times like big clocks that slowed up 
 Hold up, homie I ain't just trying to make the crowd move 
 I found truth, and now I'm trying to pass it to the sound dudes 
 Around me, around you, and to try to make it sound cool 
 I keep my ear to the streets like my face was on the ground too 
 We keep it loud too, cause even these music forms 
 Are only for His name man, hey that's why we use it for Him 
 And some cats will hate though they can't deny the beat is hot 
 We "outkast" but we still putting Christ inside your speakerbox
