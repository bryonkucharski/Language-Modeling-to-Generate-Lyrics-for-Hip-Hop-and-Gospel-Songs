Who you rollin' wit (Who you rollin' wit, who you rollin' wit) 
 Are they livin' unashamed of His name? 
 Or are they trippin' fakin' this thang? 
 Are they livin' fo da kang a da kangs? 
 Yeah, Yeah 
 My cats don't chase fame 
 My cats don't smoke weed 
 My cats don't chase chain 
 No, we got what we need 
 My cats don't chase chicks 
 My cats don't sip on 
 My cats don't stack bricks 
 Man, we focused on the Lord 
 My cats got each other 
 We call it brotherly love 
 And yeah we draped out and covered in Jesus' blood 
 My homies they straight pray 
 My homies they straight fast 
 My homies are so serious 
 An' they ain't chasin' cash 
 My sisters are so serious 
 And they ain't chasin' men 
 My sisters guardin their hearts 
 And strayin away from sin 
 My sisters they dress modest 
 Ain't showin off all their skin 
 My sisters they run a race in preparation to win 
 My squad stay in this faith 
 Cause man we know we can slip 
 That's why we stay dependent and remain off in His grip 
 My squadron never forget that we were scum of da earth (earth) 
 Livin' dead in our sin He came in and gave us birth 
 That's serious 
 When I'm with my squad it might be hard to spot me 
 'Cause we all look like a Jesus 
 Carbon copy 
 We church boys (yeah) 
 This is the charge I'm hoping you see the desperate need 
 Believers run together like the legs on a centipede (oh) 
 Oh yes indeed we fall but we get up Lifted up 
 By the body that's called to pick us up 
 So we must be surrounded by accountability partners. Without none, 
 Christian livings intentionally harder 
 Hope you're listening partner 
 Cause the fact of the matter is what happens here just hurts your walk 
 Like feet calluses look hard and there's something you should peep 
 You will see that we are the very company we keep, even me 
 (Who you rollin' with) 
 Is it cat's that's complacent or 
 Dudes that continue to grow in wisdom and patience 
 (Who you rollin' with) 
 Because this part here is crucial 
 Show our heart and hopes maybe the feeling is mutual 
 Look man we gotta roll with cats that's out shootin fo da same thang 
 Like target practice 
 God know as you look around it's hard in fact it's 
 Real discouraging instead of saints they all look backwards 
 But we gotta find some dudes (dudes) 
 Be up in the pews 
 Pray away from booze 
 Like to spread good news 
 That ain't chasin after chicks 
 That ain't livin' fo dem selvs 
 Ain't blazin' up the spliffs 
 That ain't out der tryin' to sell (yeah) 
 So take a look at the dudes in your squad 
 How they tryna be like Christ or Diddy, Ludacris, and Nas, yeah 
 And to my sisters, are the girls up in ya crew (crew) 
 Dancin like Beyoncé or followin His rules 
 Where we need accountability fo times when we gon fall (fall) 
 So when we start slippin we got folks that we can call (call) 
 They can help us get back (back) 
 Back to servin' Christ (Christ) 
 We gotta roll with cats (cats) 
 That's after eternal life
