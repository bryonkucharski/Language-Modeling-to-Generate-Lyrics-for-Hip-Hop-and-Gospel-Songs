I seen cats and they demeanor and man it seems wack 
 They think that they level is close to where Elohim's at 
 They call themselves the King 'cause they proud of them green stacks 
 But He's the most high, the highest they gets on weed sacks 
 These dudes ain't on His level bro, so please take heed and let it go 
 I know you got some cheese, but He don't even need no cheddar bro 
 He's self sufficient, check His scriptures bro He's incomparable 
 It's best you go and check His Word, this bread is more than edible 
 Face the facts, you think you amazing because you make cash 
 But look around the Heavens and Earth, homie He made that 
 You can trace back His history, its filled with peace and great acts 
 He took the sin of men, the weight He took on Him would break backs 
 Lay back and peep this, bro this ain't no secret 
 I'ma hit you with some truth you may not want it but you need it 
 I know you fly and fresh to def, but homie you ain't fresh enough I would say step your game up but you can't step it up enough 
 Who else you know? 
 That's even anything like the Lord He's meant to reign We ain't on His level man to say we are is just insane 
 Who is like Him? NOBODY! 
 Who is like Him? NOBODY! 
 Who is like Him? NOBODY! 
 Who is like Him? NOBODY! 
 Who else you know? 
 That's like our God and Father, He's the one that cat's should honor 
 Look He stands above man in His sight we grasshoppers 
 Who is like Him? NOBODY! 
 Who is like Him? NOBODY! 
 Who is like Him? NOBODY! 
 Who is like Him? NOBODY! 
 Some folks trying to say they off the chains they think they so fine 
 They good at rapping, they album went platinum four times 
 They gon shine and even when they gone, they in these folks minds 
 But top this, my God existed way before time 
 Before He made anything homie, He just was 
 He's eternal, He just made you from the dust bruh 
 One day you gon pass on, but my God will last long 
 Drag on, longer than your chrome or all your rap songs 
 A lot will stand, saying they famous and got a lot of fans 
 But they ain't got no angels praising them they not the man 
 Cats should get they minds right, I know they in the limelight 
 But our God is infinite, they illegitimate and finite 
 We created, He's creator, We was made and He's the maker 
 He's supreme over human beings, though folks try to debate us 
 A lot of kids they got it twisted like some hair that's dreaded up 
 I would say step your game up but you can't step it up enough 
 Who else you know? 
 That's even anything like the Lord He's meant to reign We ain't on His level man to say we are is just insane 
 Who is like Him? NOBODY! 
 Who is like Him? NOBODY! 
 Who is like Him? NOBODY! 
 Who is like Him? NOBODY! 
 Who else you know? 
 That's like our God and Father, He's the one that cat's should honor 
 Look He stands above man in His sight we grasshoppers 
 Who is like Him? NOBODY! 
 Who is like Him? NOBODY! 
 Who is like Him? NOBODY! 
 Who is like Him? NOBODY! 
 A few guys, know a lot of stuff and some dudes wise 
 But if they said they on His level then them dudes lied 
 Who guides the Spirit of the Lord or taught Him truth? I'd 
 Like to suggest that you see Jesus through some new eyes 
 Who measured the waters in the hollow of His hand? 
 Tell me who's the God who's marked off the heavens by the span? 
 Now tell me who calculated all the dust of the Earth? 
 He is Yahweh, God we make much of His worth 
 Tell me who you know, that's more powerful or even beautiful 
 That's truth and bro would die to save and raise after His funeral? 
 We tell men, that this God would let them drive them nails in 
 But still spreads out the heavens like a tent to dwell in 
 So the point is, He's greater than we are and man this joint is 
 To point kids, in His direction and where this joy is 
 Come on, no more fronting homie its bout time for fessing up 
 You want to step your game up but you can't step it up enough
