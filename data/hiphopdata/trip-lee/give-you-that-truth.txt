You probably wanna hear me spit bout cash 
 Bout my chicks and the clips I'ma whip out fast 
 Bout my whips, what I sip in a crystal glass 
 You love this which makes the crucifix sounds bad 
 But I don't trip, I let my light shine inside 
 I work for Him everyday like a nine to five 
 I'm gon ride wit Christ, man to crime I died 
 And for Him I get busy like my line was tied 
 You probably wanna hear drugs and thugs 
 Fun with bub and ya boy looking for love in clubs 
 But nope! I already found some love above 
 And we don't have to get smashed cause the Son was crushed 
 You just might wanna hear about some major dough 
 If that's the case move on, I preach the Savior bro 
 I don't flow to boast of toting heat and pistols 
 But to reach you and lead you to read epistles 
 You might them folks that spit bout smoke and the clip they tote 
 But we gon give you that truth 
 Even though some bored when we talk about the Lord, we some soldiers at war 
 We gon give you that truth 
 You might want that cute tees and Timbaland boots 22's and coupes 
 But we gon give you that truth 
 We ain't talking bout change we liftin up His name, to die is gain 
 We gon give you that truth 
 How do you like your hip hop music? 
 Some like it holy, some like it polluted 
 Some like a clique like the 116 
 That'll spit even if they don't make one cent 
 I refuse to lie like most of these cats 
 That do influence lives when they boast in they raps 
 And make dudes choose lives where they toting the gats 
 But Jehovah's where my hopes in I focus on that 
 No sir, we don't rhyme bout guns and knives 
 We look to Christ so we got the Son in our eyes 
 So we can't but spit bout Christ 
 Most hearts are cold that's probably why they spit bout ice 
 This our life, submitting to the Spirit inside us 
 We like some urban Spurgeons and lyrical Pipers 
 We ain't got no songs spitting game to no girls 
 But we preach da truth "Welcome to our world" 
 You might them folks that spit bout smoke and the clip they tote 
 But we gon give you that truth 
 Even though some bored when we talk about the Lord, we some soldiers at war 
 We gon give you that truth 
 You might want that cute tees and Timbaland boots 22's and coupes 
 But we gon give you that truth 
 We ain't talking bout change we liftin up His name, to die is gain 
 We gon give you that truth 
 They like, "Where the guns at dawg, where the weed at?" 
 We like, "Kill that homeboy, we don't need that" 
 Forget about the dough, 44's, and gats 
 We been saved by the blood we gon boast in that 
 And point folks to the Father, I hope they hear me flow 
 And He brings them out of the grave like the thriller video 
 Really bro I hope He uses the truth I spit 
 And I don't care if I don't never get a Billboard hit 
 We know the world might boo our tracks 
 And would rather us pack it up and move on back 
 But until I die, for Christ, yeah ya dude gon rap 
 And glorify Him with my life, spit truth on tracks 
 I bring Christ to blocks, I spit Christ in spots 
 But girls I don't wanna see you drop it like its hot
