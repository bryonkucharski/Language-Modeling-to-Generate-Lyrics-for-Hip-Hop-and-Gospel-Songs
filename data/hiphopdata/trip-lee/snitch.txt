It's T. Lee and I'm back with a fresh flow 
 Even though I ain't really left though 
 Listen in close, this is one ain't a threat bro 
 I'm just tryna help you move like the metro (let's go) 
 The worst snitch don't cut it on the block 
 Ain't talkin' 'bout them dudes that be runnin' from cops 
 Ain't talkin' 'bout them dudes that's pitchin' that D 
 Not you, not he, I'm snitchin' on me 
 Familiar with the fact that I'm weak 
 Full in sin from the beginning I lived in defeat 
 Can't sin and hide 'em in the back just to creep 
 I'm frontin' stuff pullin' covers up like a sheet 
 I love Christ, I don't wanna let my sins slide 
 But it's hard not to keep it on the inside 
 Can't stray and start livin' for me 
 Livin' foul man I gotta blow the whistle on me 
 No I don't wanna see no trash 
 So I'ma put me on blast 
 Godliness I wanna see so bad 
 That I'm willin' to put me on blast 
 I'm a snitch man, I'm a snitch (ok) 
 I'm a snitch man, I'm a snitch (you for real?) 
 I'm a snitch man, I'm a snitch (ok) 
 I'm a snitch man, I'm a snitch (you for real?) 
 Trip Lizard and I'm back on the verse 2 
 Sin ain't a game look man it'll merk you 
 Ever since the falling of the first two 
 But I can't perform no more no need for rehearsal 
 Y'all know how we like to do though 
 Frontin' like everything's nice when you know 
 You've fallen real short of the life you shoot for 
 We like kudos, we don't like rebuke though 
 Now you gotta stop and ask 
 Do you hate sin and the life it has? 
 Or do you wanna paint it like you got this sin 
 You stop it puttin' all your stock in trash 
 I wish I could say that I'm always at my peak 
 But I would be lyin', sometimes I'd rather sneak 
 Since this sin'll be a pest of my soul till death 
 I'ma always be a snitch till I'm thrown to rest 
 (Vamp) 
 If you hate yo sin you can play this song 
 Hate yo sin you just say this homes 
 I'm a snitch, ain't ashamed of that 
 I'm a snitch, ain't ashamed of that 
 If you hate yo sin you can play this song 
 Hate yo sin you just say this homes 
 I'm a snitch, ain't ashamed of that ... 
 Young Triple and I'm back with a verse 3 
 Sin ain't my friend in fact it'll hurt me 
 Praise God for his Word that alerts me 
 If I confess my sin then I obtain mercy 
 Proverbs 28:13 
 James 5:16, he'll turn me 
 I used to hide all the time till it burned me 
 Now I confess to the Lord it's the first thing 
 Then I confess to my fam that I walk with 
 Every nook and cranny, have I lost it? Nope 
 I just wanna live in light of what the cross did 
 Ain't just tryna look Christ like I'm tryna walk this 
 I ain't gotta prove that my works are the best 
 If it was up to me and my works, I'd be stressed 
 But Christ already did the work with his death 
 I repent by faith in his works, I'm a mess 
 (Vamp)
