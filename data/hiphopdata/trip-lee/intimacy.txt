Oh Lord, I'm so amazed when I dig up in Your Scripture 
 Focused and trying to get You, hoping to get a picture 
 Of who You are, true You are, Holy hoping I miss You 
 When I get away and I miss a day spending it with You 
 That's foolish, I hope to know You and be a student 
 And learn Your Holy ways all my days with no excuses 
 Ooh its such a privilege to know the God that moves and 
 Soothes this wretched soul, it was cold but he renewed it 
 And when I look at the Psalms I just pause 
 Got me dropping my jaw, its clear You got 'em in awe 
 And we can see that they yearning for Your person 
 Panting after You, and their passion for You is burning 
 I'm trying to pursue You 'cause You precious as a pearl 
 More than I did with them girls, I used to mess with in the world 
 Relentless in my pursuit, I surrender it all to You 
 And I pray You draw me closer in intimate time with You 
 There's a longing for Your love 
 Not just a moment, intimate touch 
 There's a longing for Your love 
 Not just a moment, intimate touch 
 It's way too many times, I'm staying off on the grind 
 In other areas and I bury You in my mind 
 Then my life starts getting terrible, scarier and I find 
 Myself trying to get near to You, but You was here all the time 
 But I was having my share of affairs with things You designed 
 Kind of like a bad marriage, it's scary it's like I'm blind 
 And I'm praying You'd help me, hold me, and make me focus 
 I know that when I'm lacking You I'm more than hopeless 
 Mold this wicked heart to delight in Your precious person 
 Fighting, confessing, searching for Christ and lessons for learning 
 It ain't even nothing good in me that I might show You 
 But I can see that eternal life's that I might know You 
 I want to know You, be close to the God who saved me 
 And raised me, I pray we can be much closer 
 And I- I can embrace the beautiful life that You gave me 
 I count it all loss, Lord, that I might know ya 
 There's a longing for Your love 
 Not just a moment, intimate touch 
 There's a longing for Your love 
 Not just a moment, intimate touch 
 I'm longing for Your endless love 
 The knowledge of who You are 
 The truth that lies within Your Word 
 Show my heart who You are 
 Truly I can't wait till this flesh is removed 
 And I'm forever with You, sin's mess is removed 
 Then there's nothing in the way, there's none better than You 
 To ignore that I'm more wack, this fella's a fool 
 You so mysterious, I read about You see I 
 I am so in awe of You, I'm all for You, You truly fly 
 The truth is I'm in love with You and hope that You see I 
 Would like to see You and I in U-N-I-T-Y 
 There's a longing for Your love 
 Not just a moment, intimate touch 
 There's a longing for Your love 
 Not just a moment, intimate touch 
 Lord bring me closely 
 Intimately 
 So to show me 
 Who You are 
 And to fill my cup, Lord 
 Lord bring me closely 
 Intimately 
 So to show me 
 Who You are 
 And to fill my cup, Lord 
 Just a lil bit more 
 I need a lil bit more 
 Just a lil bit more 
 I need a lil bit more 
 I need, I need more and more 
 More and more
