We will not bow down, we will not blend in 
 We proud to stand out, we will not give in (oh) 
 'Cause we don't wanna follow tha crowd 
 Nah I said w'ain't tryna follow tha crowd 
 W'ain't friends with the world 'cause this land is damned 
 Plus sin and the world go hand in hand (oh) 
 So we don't wanna follow tha crowd 
 Nah I said w'ain't tryna follow tha crowd 
 We know the world ain't tryna live for Christ 
 They missin' Christ, content with they sinful life 
 Filled with pride, the truth of the fact they blind 
 They can't get with God, He just in the back of they mind 
 Straight livin' for themselves, they don't know the Lords better 
 We wanna please Him but they livin' for they own pleasure 
 Whatever feels good, man that's what they do 
 And they don't wanna know God right now, they comfortable 
 But as believers we should be strivin' for different stuff 
 Not them princess cuts, but tryna lift Him up 
 We got a passion for His glory, know right from wrong 
 Step in the room, it's like they turned a light switch on 
 They try to pull us back to they side 
 Like, "What happened to you?" I just tell 'em the old me died 
 And now that I'm alive, I gotta live in His ways 
 Romans 8:13, we puttin' sin in its grave 
 We will not bow down, we will not blend in 
 We proud to stand out, we will not give in (oh) 
 'Cause we don't wanna follow tha crowd 
 Nah I said w'ain't tryna follow tha crowd 
 W'ain't friends with the world 'cause this land is damned 
 Plus sin and the world go hand in hand (oh) 
 So we don't wanna follow tha crowd 
 Nah I said w'ain't tryna follow tha crowd 
 Hey bro this ain't the Boyz in the Hood 
 Nah the 116 bring joy to ya hood 
 Make noise for the good news of Jesus Christ 
 We been freed and refuse not to be a light 
 Plus we know a lot of folks gon' tell us 
 If we choke off the smoke we gon' feel a lot better 
 But we pass on the herb, go grab for the word 
 We get stronger the faster we learn 
 When them cats wanna pass the drank 
 We like "Nah dog," we don't even have to think 
 If a girl walk by and they like, "Look at that!" 
 We keep our eyes straight ahead we ain't lookin' back 
 They try to pressure us back to the old ways 
 No way, we ain't goin' back to them old days 
 So when they ask, "You wanna do that playa?" 
 All I gotta say is, "Nah I don't do that there!" 
 We will not bow down, we will not blend in 
 We proud to stand out, we will not give in (oh) 
 'Cause we don't wanna follow tha crowd 
 Nah I said w'ain't tryna follow tha crowd 
 W'ain't friends with the world 'cause this land is damned 
 Plus sin and the world go hand in hand (oh) 
 So we don't wanna follow tha crowd 
 Nah I said w'ain't tryna follow tha crowd 
 We ain't in the club startin' stuff 
 Temptin' ourselves, nah we don't hit them parties up 
 'Cause if Christ ain't there, I don't wanna go either 
 My focus ain't girls, I just wanna know Jesus 
 Plus all they play is that same 'ol, same 'ol 
 Drop it down, range rove, 24's, bank rolls 
 And that's the opposite of our main goals 
 My God is it, nobody cares if my wrist ain't cold 
 They try to persuade us to give this up 
 Like, "This ain't crunk, forget about that Christian stuff" 
 But dog they don't understand, since He fixed us up 
 On the inside, since we died, this IS us 
 We stand out, it's not a chance you can mix us up 
 If you hearin' this song I hope you listen up 
 We grateful to be a light set apart from dark 
 We stand firm, won't move like cars in park 
 We will not bow down, we will not blend in 
 We proud to stand out, we will not give in (oh) 
 'Cause we don't wanna follow tha crowd 
 Nah I said w'ain't tryna follow tha crowd 
 W'ain't friends with the world 'cause this land is damned 
 Plus sin and the world go hand in hand (oh) 
 So we don't wanna follow tha crowd 
 Nah I said w'ain't tryna follow tha crowd
