 I wasn't never the type that's tryna kill folks 
 Nothing too bad maybe dabbled in a lil smoke 
 A lil lust, but wasn't never seen as a bad dude 
 Was livin' for myself dreamed of wealth and makin' cash move 
 Was told of a savior who raised named Jesus 
 That paid full of grace and I did believe it 
 They told me He would hold me and I was blessed wit Christ 
 I'm like, "I get to go to Heaven? Man I'm set for life." 
 But after that, I was just ya average Sunday Christian 
 Up in church wit my bible, back Monday sinning 
 Up in the school yard trying hard to blend in 
 Was acting dead as a carcass, far from livin' 
 I was all up in the world, I was just like the rest of them 
 Called myself a Christian, but would sin with the best of them 
 I wouldn't share my faith or read my Word it's crazy 
 I was a immature believer, a spiritual baby 
 We gotta grow, we can't stay in the same place 
 We gotta grow, we gotta be seeking His face 
 We gotta grow, so if you saved and you've been pardoned 
 We gotta grow, you ain't done you just getting started 
 We gotta grow, we can't stay in the same place 
 We gotta grow, we gotta be seeking His face 
 We gotta grow, so if you saved and you've been pardoned 
 We gotta grow, you ain't done you just getting started 
 I was my own guide, would never dive in His truth 
 But didn't realize that I was set aside for His use 
 So I'd just live for what I thought was my best interest 
 Around nonbelievers you couldn't tell the difference 
 Wan't a thug, nah I ain't got no horror story 
 But was livin' for myself not the Lord and His glory 
 My confession: I didn't seek my Dad's perfection 
 Was goin' down the wrong road like I had bad directions 
 Until He showed my not imitating the Christ 
 And livin' fo me I was truly wasting my life 
 And that Christ died so I could have relationship 
 But by my actions I refused to take this gift 
 Until He made a switch and now I want some mo of Him daily 
 By His grace I'm growing and have matured from a baby 
 I'm so grateful that I've been torn from sin 
 And day by day He's makin' me more like Him 
 We gotta grow, we can't stay in the same place 
 We gotta grow, we gotta be seeking His face 
 We gotta grow, so if you saved and you've been pardoned 
 We gotta grow, you ain't done you just getting started 
 So for my believers, I just wanna encourage y'all 
 To draw closer to the Lord I know you heard His call 
 Even if you ain't smokin' an shootin at domes 
 If you don't do it all fo His glory, you doin' it wrong 
 Heaven ain't the only reason we got saved 
 If we don't get to know Jesus then we got played 
 Plus we gotta change, He said He'd change us all 
 And the faith without fruit, that ain't faith at all (why) 
 Sanctification, check Romans 6 
 We 'posed to switch, die to sin and grow in holiness 
 All my brothers and sister I know this walk is tough 
 But even if you young just getting saved is not enough 
 We gotta talk to Him, read who the Lord in the skies is 
 The reason we breathe is to enjoy and glorify Him 
 I'm grateful the Father is changing ya boy 
 And getting closer to Him is an unexplainable joy
