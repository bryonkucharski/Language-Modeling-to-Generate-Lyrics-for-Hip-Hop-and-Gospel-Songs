Money, sex, and power are good 
 What? You want me to listen to who? 
 I don't know ... I used to like Trip Lee when he first came out 
 But I be feelin' like he be actin' like money is a sin or something 
 I don't know. What he talkin' 'bout now? 
 Let me get this off my chest, I know some folks gon' be mad 
 Ain't tryna start no mess, but I know how folks gon' react 
 Feel I gotta strive and press, tell what I mean till they see that 
 They think I got a problem with dollars and making green cash 
 But money really ain't the problem, every grand is a grant from the Father 
 When I said we can't serve both God and cash, many folks thought I meant "don't bother" 
 But I ain't saying making money ain't right, I'm just saying that your money ain't Christ 
 Please don't bow down to them greenbacks and let them stacks rule your life 
 Ain't tryna say we shouldn't get paid, I ain't tryna say that we should stay broke 
 But money don't mean you got favor, being broke don't mean that you don't 
 Money is a gift that's good, give it to the Father, to the giver 
 I've been misunderstood but I trust in the God who delivers 
 Please don't miss the problem, mayne, it is not the God who reigns 
 It is not the gifts he gave, this is what I gotta say, say 
 Don't exalt them over the God in praise 
 You can't really enjoy him till your heart's replaced 
 The gifts and the Giver are good 
 The gifts and the Giver are good 
 The gifts and the Giver are good 
 Your heart is where the problem's at, let's get that understood 
 I got something on my mind, bro, some folks might not like that 
 Feel like it's about that time to hit 'em with the truth where that light's at 
 But still some folks wanna fight that, his hand that feeds wanna bite that 
 'Cause they think pleasing is making demons of all that he made, but despite that 
 He brings good gifts like sex, I ain't tryna start no mess 
 And I don't wanna get graphic with all the facts 'cause he gave it so that he can be blessed 
 Please don't act like I'm gone, please don't just say I'm wrong 
 Just take a couple looks in the Word, you'll see this he condones it 
 Sex ain't the problem, it's sinners who just forgot him 
 Distorting, corrupt like Sodom, the gifts, they want 'em without him 
 It's beautiful in it's proper place, until we prop it up 
 And turn our footsteps from his face, and then we robbin' him 
 Please don't miss the problem, mayne, it is not the God who reigns 
 It is not the gifts he gave, this is what I gotta say, say 
 Don't exalt them over the God in praise 
 You can't really enjoy him till your heart's replaced 
 The gifts and the Giver are good 
 The gifts and the Giver are good 
 The gifts and the Giver are good 
 Your heart is where the problem's at, let's get that understood 
 Last verse, still gotta be real, submit my thoughts under his will 
 Even if it ain't really what I feel, gotta let him take that-take that wheel 
 Last thing to talk about, before end of discussion 
 I heard power corrupts, no it just shows our corruption 
 But power's really a blessing to men and to resurrection 
 And build it to help this mess of a world in which we're resting, mayne 
 Our heart's the issue so submit it to the good Lord 
 He will replace it, what you think we call him good for? 
 Please don't miss the problem, mayne, it is not the God who reigns 
 It is not the gifts he gave, this is what I gotta say, say 
 Don't exalt them over the God in praise 
 You can't really enjoy him till your heart's replaced 
 The gifts and the Giver are good 
 The gifts and the Giver are good 
 The gifts and the Giver are good 
 Your heart is where the problem's at, let's get that understood 
 Ok, ok. I think I got what he talkin' 'bout now 
 It ain't that money, power and sex are the problem 
 It's that something is wrong with my lil', my own lil' heart 
 I don't know, we'll see ... still think that man trippin'
