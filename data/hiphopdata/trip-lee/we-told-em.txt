We like to talk a lot, about how we running this Christian race 
 But then when it comes time to walk it out, nah we don't never want to get in place 
 We don't even know what it's all about, there's a problem going on with the saints 
 In church Sunday, but that's all we got, and the rest of the world gon miss His grace 
 We see them in the parking lot, we tell them all their sinners and they're missing Christ 
 We got a couple scriptures we start to drop, but we got to be a witness, got to live that life 
 But nah we just talking stuff, we off in the cut, when it comes time to shine His light 
 But we got to rep the cross and His blood, got to walk in love, 
 Got to show cats the mind of Christ 
 We told them, that we this and that, we live and act how all should 
 Now let's show them that these Christian cats ain't really wack, it's all good 
 We wildin', now they think of Christians, think we tripping that ain't cool 
 We foul and, now they think He's missing, bro let's show them what it do 
 If we gon get it for the Lord, then we gotta get on one accord 
 It's time we pick up all our swords, let's show 'em we Christians 
 If we gon get it for the Lord, then we gotta get on one accord 
 We told 'em we Christians, now let's show 'em we Christians 
 They don't take us serious even though we be talking a good game 
 They poke fun and they jeer at us, probably 'cause we don't walk how we should man 
 Nah they ain't feeling us, no distinction we just looking the same 
 It makes me furious, we don't rep Him as much as we could man 
 We tell them not to curse, and to come with the church where Jesus at 
 So some got a lot of words, but we ain't never got no deeds to match 
 We avoid the blocks and curbs, but we try to tell them where to meet us at 
 Thousands of members inside to work, but it ain't nobody on the street with cats 
 We told them, that they welcome, that we love them and we filled with joy 
 Let show them, that we willing to come to they block where cats be killing boys 
 We slacking, we ain't showing love, we act like we can't give them truth 
 Where's action, they don't know His love, let's show them that we living proof 
 If we gon get it for the Lord, then we gotta get on one accord 
 It's time we pick up all our swords, let's show 'em we Christians 
 If we gon get it for the Lord, then we gotta get on one accord 
 We told 'em we Christians, now let's show 'em we Christians 
 We like to brag to cats, bout how we bought by the God who saves 
 And how He snatches cats, by the cross and He gets them out the grave 
 We got brains that's packed with facts, bout Him who was sent to the cross and raised 
 His Word is action packed, with works and words all about His name 
 So we know that's He great, but we don't reflect Him well 
 So when we told 'em that He saves, it was hard for them to tell 
 So it's time to live this thing, in light of the God who reigns 
 Let's try not to cause Him pain, show them a pic of the God who came
