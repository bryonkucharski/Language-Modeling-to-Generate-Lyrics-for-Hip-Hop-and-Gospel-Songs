I still remember when I first started living this thing 
 And you gave me the grace to make the right decision to change 
 My whole lifestyle was flipped most thought the kid was insane 
 Even those close to me my homies wasn't feeling it mayne 
 But still I wanted some more, I wanted to know this infinite King 
 You restored my heart and your glory started to stick in my brain 
 I couldn't get enough of your scripture I was simply amazed 
 By Acts, Galatians, Revelation, 1 Corinthians, James 
 I couldn't fathom something would happen to make me stray away 
 I couldn't imagine leaving my Dad that took me from my playa ways 
 Who rescued me from the storm, all those gray and rainy days 
 The one with that amazing grace, the same one who gave me faith 
 But recently it seems to me that passion is fading 
 It's almost like I forgot my Holy Dad was amazing 
 And without noticing your Word, I started reading it less 
 Yeah I'm alive, but it feels like I'm just breathing to death 
 I'm cryin' out! 
 I'm crying out 'cause I'm weak and unworthy 
 Lord Jesus it hurts me, I'm in need of your mercy 
 Would you please come and restore me 
 To the servant I used to be 
 When I was just seeking your glory and was content with you and me 
 I'm cryin out 
 I'm crying out 'cause I'm weak and unworthy 
 Lord Jesus it hurts me, I'm in need of your mercy 
 Would you please come and restore me 
 To the servant I used to be 
 When I was just seeking your glory and was content with you and me 
 I'm cryin out 
 After you snatched you up I saw that life without you wasn't life 
 You couldn't pay me a million bucks to go back to shunning Christ 
 I'd tell my boys the joy of living abundant life 
 Read ya sword seek the Lord I'd tell 'em to run to Christ 
 But my desires much less, it's clear that I am such a mess 
 My life crumbles now I stumble and I am deserving death 
 At first it was just not reading but now it's leading to sin 
 And it's been so long I wonder if I'll see you again 
 And the sin makes it even harder for your grace change my heart up 
 Each breath I take is hard the separations getting farther 
 I'm scared to pray unto my father 'cause I feel unworthy 
 To seek His face I didn't bother, yeah it makes me wanna holler 
 Cause everything I've known seems to be fading away 
 This thing is crazy I pray that you'd erase it today 
 And I know can't just sit idle and wait for you to do it 
 But I don't know what do I'm crying as I'm going through it 
 I'm cryin out! 
 I'm crying out 'cause I'm weak and unworthy 
 Lord Jesus it hurts me, I'm in need of your mercy 
 Would you please come and restore me 
 To the servant I used to be 
 When I was just seeking your glory and was content with you and me 
 I'm cryin out 
 Now it's getting even worse cause my sin doesn't even hurt me as much 
 Why would I leave my first love I used to thirst for your touch 
 For your direction of my life I loved your glorious throne 
 I'd put myself in the back seat and seek your glory alone 
 But now because I love it less I'm becoming morally wrong 
 I may look the same to all the others but Lord you notice I'm gone 
 You know I long to come back I miss that peace I used to feel 
 When I'd reap pray unceasingly and read what you've revealed 
 But I'm not plus I got a minor depression that I'm hating 
 To learn a lesson now I'm waiting I'm starting to question my salvation 
 I'm nothing, I'm dirt I need something to work 
 So Ill try the only thing that does I gotta jump in ya Word 
 And maybe if I read I'll be able to recapture 
 The things that made fall in love with Jesus, King and Master 
 I know it'll be a struggle but I gotta fight hard 
 To delight in the Christ who saved me like lifeguards 
 I'm cryin out! 
 I'm crying out 'cause I'm weak and unworthy 
 Lord Jesus it hurts me, I'm in need of your mercy 
 Would you please come and restore me 
 To the servant I used to be 
 When I was just seeking your glory and was content with you and me 
 I'm cryin out
