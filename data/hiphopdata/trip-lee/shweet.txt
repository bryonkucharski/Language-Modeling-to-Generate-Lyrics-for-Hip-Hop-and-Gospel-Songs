Get them hands in the air 
 Make a little noise in the stands if you there 
 Brag on the Godman if you dare, only if you dare 
 That'd be shweet 
 What if when you brag it wasn't 'bout the clothes with the tags? 
 That'd be shweet 
 What if when you brag it was 'bout him who's the first and the last? 
 That'd be shweet 
 I heard them talking like they hot man 
 Somebody got them gassed up, on that octane 
 Look I hate to tell them they ain't better 
 Better get a umbrella, God reigns 
 Let's go back in time to late eighties 
 D town hold me down, that's where they made me 
 When I'm back there, I ain't vaca-ing 
 Feels like I'm home, thinking about staying, I ain't staying though 
 Ooh already already 
 Lone star state bred, how could I forget it 
 But I ain't pop up out the blue 
 It's fly how he knit me, I ain't talking 'bout the shoe, shoot 
 I got a lot of problems but I'm straight, that's shweet 
 I know my God will toss them in the lake, that's shweet 
 How many times I gotta tell you he's the boss and to him anything's a piece of cake? 
 I been in the A a lot this year 
 Perfecting these songs that I spit here 
 And ever since 2010 it's been clear 
 Everybody talking 'bout you gotta live here, I think they got me now 
 Ooh, already already 
 Lone star state bred, how could I forget it? 
 Middle school we was bumpin swisha house though 
 Had our freestyles sounding like them swisha house flows 
 Saying, "man hold up, I done came down 
 Trunk pop, gripping grain, baby stay down" 
 Wasn't talking 'bout nothing, but a pipe dream 
 Like, "man my wrist froze like ice cream" 
 But he opened my eyes, bruh 
 All my people was surprised, bruh 
 'Cause I used rap bout cash, that I never really had 
 Then I came alive, bruh 
 They say they make it happen 
 But they really only try 
 My God is the captain, he can really make it happen 
 He been reigning in the sky 
 They say they make it rain 
 They really only throw cash 
 But my Lord's running in his own lane 
 Makes rain fall and the thunder crash 
 We think we tell time 
 But we really only reading our clock 
 My God existed before time 
 And he told it when to start, mouth drop 
 We say we got it in control 
 But that's really a mirage 
 My God, he can keep the world running 
 While directing all the planets and the stars, shweet 
 Everybody go and brag that's shweet 
 That's shweet 
 Not sweet but shweet 
 With a s, h bro 
 Yessir 
 I was built to brag
