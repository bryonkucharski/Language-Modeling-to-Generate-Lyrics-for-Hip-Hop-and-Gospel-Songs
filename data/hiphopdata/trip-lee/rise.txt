Today's the day when we all rise 
 My anchor's gone so watch me come alive 
 Together we stand against the burning lies 
 And now that I found my wings to fly I'm ready to go 
 Rise, we all rise 
 Oh oh oh 
 We all rise 
 Oh oh oh 
 Today's the day 
 Rise 
 Hold up I'm back to boast on these tracks like 
 I'm mad at em, might back slap mics 
 Never mind mind the fact I never left I'm hype 
 Listen up right you ain't gotta ask me twice 
 I'm here, I'm here to brag on him like I'm known for 
 While folks snore I'ma go for it 
 My God ain't no folklore, 'cause he real, he real 
 Now to the topic at hand 
 I know the designer, he's higher than pilots who fly up in clouds he designed with his hands 
 I'm writing to tell you this life is a flash in a pan 
 How I'ma retire when we need a cryer to tell us to rise up and stand? 
 Check yo plans 
 My dude, that grave ain't your home 
 Cause you been underground way too long 
 Six deep with a date on your stone 
 All they say, "That boy gone" 
 Come on, don't you wanna go home? 
 Don't you wanna be more than a clone? 
 Do you know that you're loved and you're known? 
 We all ride on the wrong side 
 But we beating our chest at the wrong guy 
 "We don't need God" 
 We may not say it with our mouths, but we do with our whole lives 
 That's a bold lie, he's the most high no close by, we all die 
 John 5:28,29, the judge is here! 
 All rise
