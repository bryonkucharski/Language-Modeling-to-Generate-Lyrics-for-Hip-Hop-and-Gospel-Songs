On Mondays I'm at Magic like David Copperfield 
 I keep my business on shh, ask 'em how that choppa feel 
 You thought I was broke, pshh I got more than millions 
 Penthouse suite top from on the building 
 Thanksgiving swag, but I feel like a pilgrim 
 Had to change location, heard a nigga wanna kill me 
 I don't care if you kill me, just don't touch none of my children 
 With no hands, you gotta feel me 
 I came in and I got less sun, and I'm glad that I voted 
 I bought me some new animals, I got tired of sleeping with roaches 
 I walk around with this on my hip, nigga I don't need no holster 
 40 on my shit, look nigga I don't walk around with no holster 
 I say doom got that stick on me, we ride around and they ghost 
 Ride around and we toast, ride around and we loaded 
 Don't ride around with broke bitches, they'll get you off your motive 
 Sunday be boring if I ain't got no show boy, you know I-

 Shawty don't want wanna pull up her shirt, 'cause she timid 
 I told her down my pants and say hello to willy 
 Put my dick off in her face she eat it like at Beni's 
 Stand up on her chedda, I can see you like a midget 
 Tom Ford got me ballin', I'm not walkin' on my pivot 
 I don't like New England, but I love 'em Boston bitches 
 If you owe me money, boy, my whoadie will come and get it 
 Call me me YT Quan I done gained a new position 
 Plus shawty ain't got teeth, I gotta spoon feed her 
 I was failin' until I fucked one of my school teachers 
 I wasn't feelin' detention, so I skipped school, people 
 Yeah, I skipped school, nigga 
 I never thought I would make it this far 
 I had to open my eyes and relax 
 And God gave me a gift and that's my voice, and I'mma run wit it
