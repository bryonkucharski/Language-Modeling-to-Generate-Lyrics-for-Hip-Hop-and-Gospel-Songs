Auto start that motherfucker Quan 
 Hahaa, yeah, aye 
 I just might pull up in that Bugatti 
 I just might pull up in that Ferrari 
 I just might pull up in that 4-5-8 
 I just might pull up in that new Spider 
 I pull up by myself no one behind me 
 Try a nigga like me 100 soldiers ridin' 
 I might pull up on you catch body 
 I pull up on you Thurdays, fuck a Friday 
 Boy bullets at yo head like a visor 
 Got niggas in the bushes and they hidin' 
 Plus they gone lay on you until you outside it 
 And they gone make it hard for folks to find ya 
 I hate to get involved with violence 
 But you done went too far and got beside yourself 
 Its only one me stop trying 
 Cause you could never beat me with the finest help 
 Pull up on that nigga with the beam 
 Yeah, what you want lil nigga 
 If ion't know you I ain't gone serve ya 
 Nah, what you want lil nigga 
 My P.O. know my piss dirty 
 Hmm, what you want from a nigga 
 I could switch cars up every Thurday 
 Park the big truck now I'm riding in the donk lil nigga 
 Shawty stay charged like a Tesla 
 And every car flexin' 
 Got a nigga question mark guessin' 
 I sound good thank the boy Evan 
 Might strap catch ya 
 Ballin' on him like George Jetson 
 Pull up on a nigga with the windows down 
 Straight shots, shooting at everything we said lil nigga 
 You mad cause you heard I fucked yo bitch mouth 
 But a fuck nigga nah, I could never be a lil nigga 
 Gotta whole lotta money, more problems 
 Biggie said it, Biggie said it nigga I know it 
 Kickin shit on these niggas just like soccer 
 Catchin bullshit in the air just like a goalie 
 Went to private school nigga just to talk proper 
 70000 for the bust down rollie 
 Used to hide weed in my motherfuckin' locker 
 Boy I pray to God that car not stolen because... 
 I just might pull up in that Bugatti
