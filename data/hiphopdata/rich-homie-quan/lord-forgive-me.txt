Pull up in a brand new Bentley drop top and I got 4 hoes with me 
 Everybody know the A7 Audi that I drive got little bit of gold in it 
 Leave a nigga dead on the beat got a nigga feelin' just like a mortician 
 I ain't saying that I'm perfect, I know I sin everyday, all I ask is Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me 
 If I can't make it at the church every Sunday just understand 
 Lord forgive me 
 If I'm pressured to kill a nigga hope you see where I'm comin' from and listen what I'm sayin' 
 Lord forgive me 
 I know I'm not married but I'm fuckin' these bitches every city I go 
 Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me (Amen, Amen) 
 If I make a couple of mistakes 
 I ain't sayin' I'm perfect or great, Lord 
 Going fishin' shawty you the bait 
 Ain't no competition you bae 
 And I just wanna know if I could dive in the pussy, go down on the pussy, head dive first 
 Got your legs wide open 
 Destiny's child make you say my name 
 Versace everything even my sheets too 
 Get the knees black even me too 
 I might eat that pussy like Kiku 
 Baby I just wanna meet and greet you 
 And I'm in love with your beauty like a beast too and she told me she don't even eat seafood 
 Made her eat this dick then told her open her mouth what we call that? Yeah we call it see food 
 Lord please forgive me 
 If I have to send one of these niggas to you, Lord please forgive me 
 I'ma hurt they feelings when I get that brand new car and do work nigga

 Please please (Lord Forgive Me) 
 I know I fucked up listen (Lord) 
 I done fucked up man (Forgive Me) 
 No weapon formed against me shall prosper 
 That got me through jail when I was locked up 
 Keep your eyes on snakes they'll bite ya 
 Grind hard, this shit don't come over night bruh 
 I don't need a pistol nigga I'll fight y'all 
 In my closet, more shoes than flight club 
 Ride deep on the beat like a bike club 
 Sleep all day, all night uh 
 I done did a lot of fucked up shit 
 I just pray God forgive me 
 I done did shit I ain't thought about 
 God forgive me promise I'ma be a better person 
 I seem to only pray when it's an emergency (Why?) 
 Told 'em 'cause the beat like surgery (Why?) 
 A lot of y'all fuck niggas talkin' 
 I remember I was walkin', told 'em what I'm doin' now
