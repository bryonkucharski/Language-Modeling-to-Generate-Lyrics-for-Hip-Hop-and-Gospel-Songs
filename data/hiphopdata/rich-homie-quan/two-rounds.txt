Intro: Rich Homie Quan] 
 I was in Houston for the minute now I'm back in town (x2) 
 Rich Homie Baby! 
 (Verse 1: Propain) 
 All it takes is one text 
 Asking me where I'm at 
 Told her," Baby I'm on one but your destination is next" 
 Now I'm coming down on that freeway that UGK in my deck 
 Got that "Take It Off "on replay like Pimp C said it 
 Now she texting me she need it bad because she ain't have good in so long 
 And I'm like,'Damn shorty I'm speeding fast and when I get to you girl it's on' 
 And when I make it there I want to see that ass no boy shorts and no thong 
 She got that ocean hair have a nigga sinking quick 
 Rock the boat on my Aaliyah shit 
 I hit the block and showed up in a beastin' whip 
 Ciroc is poured up and Keisha lit 
 I know your neighbors probably never heard of me 
 But they gon' know my name when you screaming it 
 'Cause I'm going in, going in 
 At The same time I'm showing out 
 Got her legs shaking, rolling round 
 And her head crazy like a robot 
 (Hook: Rich Homie Quan) 
 I could tell she had her shit when she smiled 
 Shorty lil dramatic but it compliment her style 
 Late nights we get romantic 
 Need a babysitter for her child 
 If I whip her she like ooh child 
 Imma hit that pussy all night wake up another two rounds 
 Living room got like 8 pictures we done knocked another two down 
 Two! 
 Yeah, Yeah 
 I was in Houston for the minute now I'm back in town (x2) 
 (Verse 2: Propain) 
 She ain't worried about no nigga 
 Got a her own bread got her own business 
 Laced up and it's a velvet [?] 
 Silent niggas think she gold digging 
 Truth be told she got more than you 
 So what the hell you think she need with your figures? 
 Ain't nothing better so I drop whatever 
 I'm going down when she call 
 Really ain't nothing with her it go down whatever 
 From the bedroom to the wall 
 It's the ones who bad with hustle that never ask for nothing that a nigga want to give all 
 Everytime I hit it man I need some more I notice 
 I can't resist it's when the dope is potent 
 Shorty ride this dick just like a roller coaster 
 Likes to drive it quick then in a slower motion 
 I be hitting it like I got sentenced to life 
 I'm going dumb I'm so unfocused 
 It's a trill nigga, trill nigga; all she want is a trill nigga 
 Most you lames couldn't deal with her 
 I knock it out 
 (?) 
 (Verse 3: Rich Homie Quan) 
 I got this lil quiet bitch who never said shit 
 She thick as hell she stripping dreams and she from Texas 
 I'm well protected baby Jesus on my necklace 
 Big Flu my nigga Big Throw my nigga and DJ Everett 
 Propain! 
 What it do
