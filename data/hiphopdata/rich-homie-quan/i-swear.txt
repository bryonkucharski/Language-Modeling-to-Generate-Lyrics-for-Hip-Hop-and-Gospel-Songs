(Rich Homie Quan Talking:) 
 Despite how much money I get 
 Or how much I make off this shit 
 I still watch them bitches man 
 Them bitches slimy bro 
 To all my young niggas 
 Don't trust these hoes, man 
 Quan tell them how these hoes bang 
 You might like me for who I am 
 In love with my money you just want me cause of what I got 
 I heard them niggas was lurking on me 
 So you know the homie had to get'on up in the spot 
 I spent so long at the bottom took a elevator to the top 
 4,5 a.m. riding 'round with the muthafuckin' top 
 Police pulled me over 'cause he said I need a bra 
 'Cause I'm riding 'round topless 
 New car, new wheel, new brain, new bitch, good brain

 Big chopper, big aim 
 Make that thing shit stain now I got his ass looking like a fool 
 I won't even be ashamed if a nigga catch me slipping 
 'Cause I know it ain't shit that I can do

 All of my watches have frosted flakes

 Fuck a new boot I got lots of papers in my pocket (they watching)
