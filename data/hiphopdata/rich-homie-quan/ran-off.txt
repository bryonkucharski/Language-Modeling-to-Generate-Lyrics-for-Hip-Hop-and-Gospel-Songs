Ran off that money, yeah yeah 
 Ran off that diamonds, yeah yeah 
 Fuckin' hoes on a Monday, yeah yeah 
 Thursday, Friday and Sunday, yeah yeah 
 I'm gon' keep getting money on this niggas just like yeah yeah 
 I'm gon' keep fucking these nigga bitches just like yeah yeah 
 Gotta know the opposite of no always gon' be yeah yeah 
 And I'm gon' never stop getting to the money boy, you know I swear swear 
 I just bought me a brand new rollie, Icebox, I swear 
 I ain't even walked in the club yet, and I already sold it out the bar 
 I used to smoke nothing but swisher, now I roll my weed raw 
 Ass so fat I ain't have no condom boy had to hit that raw 
 But you gotta know a nigga like me pull it out and I went straight for the mouth 
 I just want her little potato 
 If I leave that pussy red like a little tomato 
 Hide right under the bed, cause her daddy crazy 
 I rep the 5 like a motherfuckin' nickel baby 
 Ay look, extra money is just grip statement 
 I promise I gotta die anyway 
 I done made a whole lotta money 
 I done seen a whole lotta people 
 I had to stack a onion 
 My foreign cars are real 
 Pull up in that 458 spider 
 That every nigga gon' hate 
 Because you know he wanna be us (For real) 
 I want to touch 
 She wouldn't let me 
 I want to fuck 
 She just be neglecting 
 I want to love her 
 I want to wife her 
 I want to walk down the isle 
 Your daddy gave me permission 
 Your momma didn't wanna listen 
 Your brother can't stand my guts 
 Your sister she love my pimpin' 
 She don't know that her friends so freaky 
 She don't know that they really love her 
 She might as well fuck with me, instead of a chicken nugget 
 I got chicken tender for you 
 Ay, where that ranch at, babe? 
 We could fuck up the mall 
 Girl and ball like a cancer patient 
 Hate when a nigga be lying, boy you talking and that aggravate me 
 Her best friend play baseball in the outfit (?) 
 They treat me (?) 
 (?) Put me on and told me a lot of these jewels are fake 
 I know that your rollie fake 
 Look at your wrist that shit outdated 
 Once watchbusters catch it 
 You can't hide it, ain't no secret 
 Might as well give that shit away 
 Ain't no point even tryin' to keep it 
 I love my nigga bleeding 
 That dog food I feed it 
 To my soldier, to my young nigga 
 I told you get to clapping shit, hallelujah 
 I ain't dappin' for you If I don't know you 
 I got 10 bands saran wrapped in a Toyota
