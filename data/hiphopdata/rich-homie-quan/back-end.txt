30 thousand for a Jesus piece, I put that on yo' head 
 Freddy Krueger don't scare me no more, them boys will bite you in that bed 
 Talk to God before I eat, and end it off with a \"Amen\" 
 I don't care how tired I get, I'ma still run up them bands 
 I'ma still count up my back end, I'ma still do it for my fam 
 Just because I got a lil' money, that do not define the person I am 
 I don't give a fuck about what the critics say, I'ma stack it up for them papers 
 I clocked in, like I'm workin' 
 I ain't have to sell my soul, it ain't worth it 
 Sold out, sold out, now I'm mad 
 We done sold out, it's a hold out, hold out on them bags 
 We gon' roll 'bout 1 somethin', 4 of y'all, 2 in the van 
 I don't care what that money do, I'ma blow this shit like a fan 
 RIP to my nigga Shawty Lo, I'm still walkin' 'round feelin' like the man 
 Commissary goin' out on Sunday, gotta make sure I still got a plan 
 Talk to my girl on Monday, on the phone with my hands in my pants 
 Walkin' around with my hand on my ear 'cause I ain't heard a word that they sayin' 
 Niggas talk about what they gon' do, rubber bands still around that paper 
 Overdue for some new music, might as well put it out for my haters 
 Niggas talkin' hard, know they can't stop me, I'm in that front yard with them choppers 
 I'll do whatever for my partner, I hit the jewelry store with 
 30 thousand for a Jesus piece, I put that on yo' head 
 Freddy Krueger don't scare me no more, them boys will bite you in that bed 
 Talk to God before I eat, and end it off with a \"Amen\" 
 I don't care how tired I get, I'ma still run up them bands 
 I'ma still count up my back end, I'ma still do it for my fam 
 Just because I got a lil' money, that do not define the person I am 
 I don't give a fuck about what the critics say, I'ma stack it up for them papers 
 I clocked in, like I'm workin' 
 I ain't have to sell my soul, it ain't worth it 
 Nigga lurkin', cell phone, no serivce 
 Tent on the car, not workin', so I had to close them curtains (Ooh) 
 Pulled up in somethin' they ain't never heard of 
 I ain't seen no caution tape, but the whole scene I murdered 
 (Woo) Lyin' to me, I'm used to bitches 
 Watchin' out who I'm talkin' to, 'cause a lot of niggas, they superstitious 
 Dirty pots, 'cause I used the dishes 
 40 Glock, keep it in my britches 
 50 shots of them big bullets, that lil' nigga might need stitches 
 That big body, I lean in it 
 That drop top sellin' fiends in it 
 And I ain't gotta wear a suit everyday to show a nigga I mean business 
 With all this lean, I need a kidney 
 Why the lil' boy goin' so hard? 
 You tellin' on me, you the real 12 
 You lame as hell like a soap opera 
 30 thousand for a Jesus piece, I put that on yo' head 
 Freddy Krueger don't scare me no more, them boys will bite you in that bed 
 Talk to God before I eat, and end it off with a \"Amen\" 
 I don't care how tired I get, I'ma still run up them bands
