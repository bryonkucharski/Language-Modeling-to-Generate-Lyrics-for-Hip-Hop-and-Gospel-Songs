(Rich homie) 
 I ain't never felt like this (Quan) 
 I ain't never felt like this 
 I ain't never felt like this 
 I ain't never felt like this 
 I ain't never felt, I ain't never felt 
 I ain't never felt like this 
 I feel like biggie when he got his first check 
 I'm feeling like Big Meech when he fucked up the whole A 
 I'm in love with too much money to find me a soul mate 
 I feel like I'm 2Pac cause my set be on the way 
 I throw up them W's no W that's where we stay 
 From Inglewood up to (?) I'm good wherever I'm at 
 Blow torch that fence I had dropped it and told the police suck my dick 
 And got away then I bought that bitch a Birkin bag and told that hoe to get out of my face 
 I (don't do what) don't condone the violence 
 I count it on what Miley Cyrus 
 I got nothing but codeine all in my body 
 I want her to get on top of me and ride me like a Harley 
 I wanted to be rich, I couldn't get that shit, I couldn't get that shit so 
 I had to make my own way by myself, I had to make a own name by myself 
 I couldn't get rich, I didn't have shit, I didn't have enough so I did what I did 
 Went to jail, did my biz 
 Came home, I took off, I took off 
 I feel like biggie when he got his first check 
 I'm feeling like Big Meech when he fucked up the whole A 
 I'm in love with too much money to find me a soul mate 
 I feel like I'm 2Pac cause my set be on the way 
 I throw up them W's no W that's where we stay 
 From Inglewood up to (?) I'm good wherever I'm at 
 Blow torch that fence I had dropped it and told the police suck my dick 
 And got away then I bought that bitch a Birkin bag and told that hoe to get out of my face 
 I don't know why I feel like this 
 Purple mack lipstick all on my dick 
 Hit it from the side legs up don't try to look at my wrist 
 Is that a rollie, Yeah 
 Hit it from the back while I do the Rich Homie dance 
 I'm chillin' on this yacht with a hundred thousand in my pants 
 I can still whip it in the pot nigga I be still poppin' xans 
 Who the fuck gone stop the man 
 I can end a motherfucking nigga life like a doctor can 
 But I didn't know I was gone be this rich, I had to take some X 'cause I didn't know I would be this rich 
 But I got too much invested plus I'm a (?) 
 I feel like Michael Jordan when he played with the 98 Bulls 
 I feel like biggie when he got his first check 
 I'm feeling like Big Meech when he fucked up the whole A 
 I'm in love with too much money to find me a soul mate 
 I feel like I'm 2Pac cause my set be on the way 
 I throw up them W's no W that's where we stay 
 From Inglewood up to (?) I'm good wherever I'm at 
 Blow torch that fence I had dropped it and told the police suck my dick 
 And got away then I bought that bitch a Birkin bag and told that hoe to get out of my face
