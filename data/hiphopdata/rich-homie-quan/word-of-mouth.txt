 It's you who I needed, and without you, girl, I cried for you 
 Take a bullet for you, sacrifice my life and die for you 
 Set my standards high for you 
 Tall ladder, climb to me 
 Circle full of millionaires, I'm standing around money 
 Green Ben Frank lookin' old, light brown money 
 Got a safe in my mama house, bought the old school without of town money 
 Hard top, windows down, we riding around, them pistols out 
 Act stuck up 'cause I'm the shit, you know my ass they kissing now
