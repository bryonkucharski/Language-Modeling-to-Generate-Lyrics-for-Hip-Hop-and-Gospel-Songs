Yeah, they said I wouldn't be shit 
 They thought that shit was over with 
 Sose can't say it 
 Quan you got to go back to you bro 
 When I was little I had people say I would never make it 
 Them same people who said it and now we separated 
 They think I'm sleep playin' dead no I'm just meditatin' 
 Don't take that fame to the head grind like you never made it 
 Shine like you never made it 
 I keep that money on my mind like I never made it 
 Flex like I never made it 
 Every check you better save it 
 I'm still aiming for the top like I never made it 
 Never made it 
 Never thought that I would be in the situation that I'm in 
 Never thought these folks would turn their back on me thought they was fans 
 All these niggas talkin', smilin' faces I had thought they was friends 
 That's why I had to grow my hair afro that turned to the trend 
 Everybody had one 
 When that Flex went double platinum felt like everybody hated Quan 
 And when y'all was 'posed to be happy this my city I didn't feel like y'all was proud of me 
 Feel like I was trapped in a cell, feel like y'all doubted me 
 Don't let that Tim Westwood shit fool you, after some Type Of Way 
 I swear my life turned to a movie, came a long way from that losin' 
 And I swear none of ths shit was handed to me 
 Never forget I still got me a lil' family to feed, I swear 
 When I was little I had people say I would never make it 
 Them same people who said it and now we separated 
 They think I'm sleep playin' dead no I'm just meditatin' 
 Don't take that fame to the head grind like you never made it 
 Shine like you never made it 
 I keep that money on my mind like I never made it 
 Flex like I never made it 
 Every check you better save it 
 I'm still aiming for the top like I never made it 
 Never made it
