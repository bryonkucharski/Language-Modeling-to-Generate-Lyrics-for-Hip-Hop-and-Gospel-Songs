Yeah 
 Listen 
 All I need is money 
 All I need is you 
 And Ion care who tell it 
 So I seek the truth 
 And who say I ain't real 
 I can be the proof 
 I say what I feel 
 Cause all I know is truth 
 And I blow is fruit 
 And I roll is coop 
 And if that girl fuck'd more then 10 niggas 
 That ho the swoop 
 And they don't get it, but they might do 
 My lingo crazy every since, that right two 
 Yeah, and I got everything that I need 
 I'm lost but I need that key 
 Like a shirt without no sleeves 
 Harmless and Armless 
 I gucci all my garments 
 She feeling on me, 
 Like she searching for something 
 No warrant 
 And I'm high baby, so fly baby 
 Debbie cakes, no pie baby 
 Eating em' up like child baby 
 All I need 
 Is some money 
 All I need 
 Aye light Po... the plan on me 
 Aye Swag... Roll Up 
 Aye White Boi... what it do

 And a smith and wesson Glock .40

 And my Grandma the cafeteria manager 
 I always ate lunch free 
 'Cause I stay down like I suppose too 
 Ridin' round in that old skool 
 My car ready for that showroom

 See I'm barely walkin' 
 Every other day shopping
