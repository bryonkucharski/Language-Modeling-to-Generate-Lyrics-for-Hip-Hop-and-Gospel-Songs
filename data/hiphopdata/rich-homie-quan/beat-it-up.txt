Why my bitch cheating on me? 
 What the fuck I do to her? 
 I ain't did nothing nigga 
 Why she wanna play with me? 
 My feelings done got involved 
 Nah that bitch can't stay with me 
 Swear to God on my Grannie 
 Rest in peace to, Annie 
 Now the bitch got two daddies 
 This a reunion, no family! 
 I wanna fuck you in your best outfit girl put in on, Yeah 
 David Copperfield, baby girl I can get it gone, Nair 
 You the picture, Imma put you on the wall 
 I'm the hammer, you the nail 
 Beat it up, Beat it up, Beat it up, Beat it! 
 Put your ass to sleep, baby girl tempur-pedic 
 Cuhz whip it up, in a pan like Pita 
 Love big titties, turned on by them C Cups 
 Did a show in Boston drinking lean out a tea cup 
 No party, I'm sorry 
 Ridin' round in the motorcycle, no Harley 
 That lil ho retarded, had to nickname lil bitch... tortoise 
 Shootin' shots, I ignore it 
 Pants saggin' 'cause I walk around with that 40 
 Nigga talkin' beef, eat it up 'cause I'm hungry 
 Fuck YARS, nigga I'm extortin' 
 Feelin' like J-Prince nigga 
 J-Prince son Jas, fuck with me every time 
 I was in LA chillin' at Jas Prince house 
 A deal, I ain't never signed 
 I ain't never ever ever lost shit 
 Kill a nigga, knock 'em off, what's a fuckin' lawsuit? 
 Shoot a nigga momma house up, no talkin' 
 (Shh) Too much talkin'... 
 Ran out with a 100 bands, I ain't playin' 
 Cause the promoter, thought I was playin' 
 Got a 2-2-3 Lebron James, Cleveland 
 Why am I insecure bout my woman? 
 Why my bitch cheating on me?

 I don't lick pussy but tonight I might eat it 
 I don't want that shit lil bitch, I just want my receipt back 
 She grippin' on my nuts, Michael Jackson I might beat it 
 Her first name Victoria, I know she got some secrets 
 I don't wanna fuck with her, if she ain't gon' keep it 
 Real with a nigga till the end, girl I need ya 
 Let me put my dick inside your hole, peep it 
 Thugga want your soul, he need it 
 She ain't got too many times, she got 3 stripes like an Adidas (Ay) 
 Let the lil bitch come roll me like tempur-pedic (Ay) 
 Throw that pussy, I catch it like a receiver play 
 If she find out I cheated, she might just leave that day 
 Put that lil bitch on her feet, no bengay 
 Jonesboro South raised me, that's what kids say 
 And my diamonds they come wet like a fish tank 
 Lil money big bank take lil bank (Yeah) 
 Lil nigga wanna play, I'll leave 'em in a wheel chair 
 Yellow bone bitch from Toronto, she a regular 
 When I kiss her, I be suckin on her neck like Dracula 
 And I'm a motherfuckin' lion, nigga cats kill 
 Why my bitch cheating on me? 
 What the fuck I do to her? 
 I ain't did nothing nigga 
 Why she wanna play with me? 
 My feelings done got involved
