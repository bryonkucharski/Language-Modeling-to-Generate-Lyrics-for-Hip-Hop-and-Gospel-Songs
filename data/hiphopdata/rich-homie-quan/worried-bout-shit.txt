You can sit back with your feet laid up 
 In the penthouse suite, you ain't gotta worry 'bout shit 
 I'm a go out, get the dough, after that, get some more 
 To make sure that you ain't worried 'bout shit 
 Baby, where the money at? added? where the dough? 
 Make sure you ain't ever gotta worry 'bout shit 
 Put that on my momma and I put that on my daddy 
 Swear to God, baby, you ain't ever gotta worry 'bout shit 
 I ain't worried 'bout shit 'cause a nigga like me ain't got too much to lose 
 I ain't got no point to prove, catch his ass slippin' been in overtime to shoot 
 I be still catchin' Charlie, 'cause I'm still crazy 
 I might pull up on you and then go like Patrick Swayze 
 Told that bitch to cum thought I was talking masturbation, but I won 
 Niggas talkin' to the police investigatin', ho know what I'm doin' 
 Whole lotta gula, lots of paper, you know I run it up 
 You just sit down nigga, pussy niggas stand it up 
 I got money to the ceiling, I got lots of hoes, 'cause I don't got no feelings 
 Call me Mr. Polar, all I know is dealer 
 Since I went solo, these niggas In their feelings, ya feel me? 
 All I'm tryna get is money, tryna stack a couple dollar all to feed my family 
 Got some B.E.T awards now it's time for a Grammy 
 I still do it for my mamma, shouts out to Tammy 
 I had to let her know 
 You can sit back with your feet laid up 
 In the penthouse suite, you ain't gotta worry 'bout shit 
 I'm a go out, get the dough, after that, get some more 
 To make sure that you ain't worried 'bout shit 
 Baby, where the money at? added? where the dough? 
 Make sure you ain't ever gotta worry 'bout shit 
 Put that on my momma and I put that on my daddy 
 Swear to God, baby, you ain't ever gotta worry 'bout shit
