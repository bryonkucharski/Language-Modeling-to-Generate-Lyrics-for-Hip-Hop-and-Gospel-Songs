 I ain't know nothing but the streets 
 I ain't know nothing but the streets 
 I ain't know nothing but the streets 
 I ain't know nothing 'bout no drank until the age of 13 
 I ain't know nothing 'bout no money 'til the age of 14 
 I ain't know nothing 'bout no condom 'til the age of 15 
 And I ain't never go to class as a teen 
 I ain't dumb, but I ain't know nothing but the streets 
 I ain't know nothing but the streets 
 I ain't know nothing but the streets 
 I ain't know nothing, I ain't know nothing, I ain't know nothing but the streets 
 I ain't know nothing but the streets 
 I ain't know nothing but the streets 
 I ain't know nothing, I ain't know nothing, I ain't know nothing but the streets 
 17 was the worst, feel like I ain't had no purpose 
 At 18 was workin' 
 At 18 was lurkin' 
 At 18 I graduated, a lotta lames in my class, I know they mad I made it 
 I keep my phone on silent because it aggravates me 
 And I protect my paper like it's laminated 
 Contaminated, I can't even touch the water 
 I damaged faces and I'm all on his lil daughter 
 No cancer patient but you know a nigga ballin' 
 I'ma keep goin' all then like I was in Charlotte 
 I ain't know nothing 'bout no drank until the age of 13 
 I ain't know nothing 'bout no money 'til the age of 14 
 I ain't know nothing 'bout no condom 'til the age of 15 
 And I ain't never go to class as a teen 
 I ain't dumb, but I ain't know nothing but the streets 
 I ain't know nothing but the streets 
 I ain't know nothing but the streets 
 I ain't know nothing, I ain't know nothing, I ain't know nothing but the streets 
 I ain't know nothing but the streets 
 I ain't know nothing but the streets 
 I ain't know nothing, I ain't know nothing, I ain't know nothing but the streets 
 Okay, now age 21, I spent locked up 
 22, came home told myself no more gettin' back locked up 
 Came home focused, new mind frame, knew nothing could stop us 
 By 23 my baby momma she was knocked up 
 Where you think double R come from? 
 That Royal Rich my second son 
 Tryna do the best for them 
 So they ain't gotta go through what I used to do when I was breakin' in houses 
 I was tryna make a better life for them (I swear) 
 And I succeeded at that 
 At 24 had 10 cars, I thought a Beamer was next 
 My nigga, 'My Nigga,' went platinum, I received me a plaque 
 By 25 years million I had maybe like 5 more man I ain't done yet 
 I ain't know nothing 'bout no drank until the age of 13 
 I ain't know nothing 'bout no money 'til the age of 14 
 I ain't know nothing 'bout no condom 'til the age of 15 
 And I ain't never go to class as a teen 
 I ain't dumb, but I ain't know nothing but the streets 
 I ain't know nothing but the streets 
 I ain't know nothing but the streets 
 I ain't know nothing, I ain't know nothing, I ain't know nothing but the streets 
 I ain't know nothing but the streets 
 I ain't know nothing but the streets 
 I ain't know nothing, I ain't know nothing, I ain't know nothing but the streets
