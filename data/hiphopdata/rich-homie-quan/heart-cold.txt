They throwin' rocks and hide their hands I ain't surprised 
 I don't stand in traps I no longer supervise 
 I thank God every night before I close my eyes 
 Beefin' with them niggas shot at 'em like 3 times 
 If I'm wrong then I don't wanna be right 
 Got my phone in the back of my Levi's 
 And I still don't trust no bitch 'cause at the end she lied 
 I got these 100s in the safe stacked up knee high 
 Fuckin' hoes gettin' old, gettin' money ain't new 
 Shawty thinkin' I'ma business man 'cause she seen homie in a suit 
 Top drop at anytime need a GPS for the roof 
 And I don't really like no nigga who talk a lot rather show me what you gon' do 
 Parallel in the parking lot I'm rollin' smoked out in the coupe 
 Got these 100 dollar bills in rubber bands 'cause I don't like to carry money loose 
 Got a couple bands on these niggas' head if I say the word they gon' shoot 
 And I ain't beefin' with no nigga 'bout no bitch to me that ain't cool 
 It's too much money to be made out here yeah 
 Gotta keep my gun it ain't safe out here 
 Been stayin' down can't show my face 'round here 
 And I ain't trippin' cut the lights out 
 Got this cross on my chest and you know it's iced out 
 Heart cold ice box 
 Eyes closed, lights out 
 Chicago White Sox 
 Talk hard pipe down 
 Shootin' shit head target 
 Dead fresh red carpet 
 I can't hear you nigga money in the way say it louder 
 Talk loud nah nigga 
 Money in the wall with a tracker on the phone just in case you wanna call a nigga 
 I'm paranoid, geeked up 
 I see dead people, I see you before you comin' I'm lookin' through the peephole 
 The G code yeah you know I'm stickin' to it 
 Turn the volume up on these headphones I wanna listen to it 
 Keep the chopper, yeah in the back man and let the pistol do it 
 Can't close my eyes gotta face my fear just grip and do it 
 Stick and move you know I'm stickin' to what we planned 
 He sick of losin' I heard he spent all of his advance 
 Feel like a movie I walked in feelin' just like the man 
 On every move I hit I make sure I had my man's 
 Right hand truth if I swear I will never take the stand 
 I swear I shoot just look at the blisters on my hand 
 Shine bright, headlight I gotta make the transaction if you got the bread right 
 This cross make me feel alive 
 Heart cold ice box 
 Eyes closed, lights out 
 Chicago White Sox 
 Talk hard pipe down 
 Shootin' shit head target 
 Dead fresh red carpet 
 I can't hear you nigga money in the way say it louder 
 Talk loud nah nigga 
 Money in the wall with a tracker on the phone just in case you wanna call a nigga 
 I'm paranoid, geeked up 
 I see dead people, I see you before you comin' I'm lookin' through the peephole 
 Heart cold ice box 
 Eyes closed, lights out 
 Talk hard pipe down 
 I can't hear you nigga money in the way say it louder 
 Money in the wall with a tracker on the phone just in case you wanna call a nigga 
 I see dead people, I see dead people
