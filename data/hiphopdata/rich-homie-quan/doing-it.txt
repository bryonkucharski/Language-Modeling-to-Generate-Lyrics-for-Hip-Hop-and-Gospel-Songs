I got things about you that I can't put my finger on it 
 And I gotta keep her crowded, 'cause I hate to see her lonely 
 I'm tryna love her for a life time, I can't love that girl for a moment 
 And I done broke so many swears, I can't break this promise for you 
 For you I gotta stay true 
 I can't even do that old like old shit I used to do 
 I want you to hold dick down like you supposed to 
 If you sick I got soup, ride this dick like a coop, only got room two 
 I got bitches who do whatever I tell 'em to do 
 I got niggas who shoot whatever I tell them to shoot 
 Been on so many downers, nigga I need some boost 
 Take me up to the moon, something 'bout your mouth 
 'Cause I love that thang you do with your tongue when you do it, baby 
 I love that thang you do with your tongue when you do it, baby 
 I love that thang you do with your always move it, baby 
 I say I love that thing you do, it's always when you move it, baby 
 And you doin' it 
 You doin' it, you doin' it 
 Uh, just keep doin' it 
 Keep doin' it, keep doin' it 
 What you doin', you doin' it 
 What you do, just keep doin' it 
 What you do, you doin' it
