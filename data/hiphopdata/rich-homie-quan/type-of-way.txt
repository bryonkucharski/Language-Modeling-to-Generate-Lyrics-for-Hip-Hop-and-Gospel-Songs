My niggas been hustlin' trying to make him something 
 Ain't no telling what he'll do for the paper 
 Soufflé, I'm straight, I steak my plate 
 Sade, I'm a smooth operator 
 (I drop the top of my whip baby!) 
 That car I'm driving make you feel some type of way 
 That custom Breitling make you feel some type of way 
 This bitch I'm with got me feeln' some type a way 
 Is it because my homies rich you feel some type of way? 
 Some type of way, make you feel some type of way 
 Heard she wana fuck me, know you feel some type of way 
 Mr. CEO is what my title say 
 Me and my homies did your ho, he feel some type of way 
 Okay, now let's be real I know you feel some type of way 
 When I get to biting on her ear she make that Tyson face 
 I drop down to my knees thankful for life today 
 No naps since long sleep; hibernate 
 I can tell if he tell if he 12, right away 
 Go through hell 'cause I care, move you far away 
 Drop you off late, know he feel some type of way 
 I got hoes like golf trynna make what Tiger makes 
 I got a hide away, and I go there sometimes, to give my mind a break 
 I find a way, to still get through the struggle, what I'm tryna say 
 And I ain't lying today when I tell you that I love...

 She got a Georgia peach on her rear end like a licence plate 
 No rookie, girl scout cookie got me high today 
 I probably make, more money in six months 
 Than what's in your papa's safe 
 Look like I robbed a bank 
 I set it off like Queen Latifah, 'cause I'm living single 
 I'm feeling cautious, I ain't scream when they served a subpoena 
 I heard that he the leader, come follow my tribe today 
 I fucked her now he heated, he feel some type of way 
 Don't know how to say, ain't the hardest man working? 
 Attention we pay, there's always a man lurking 
 No man perfect, but God 
 My head, I nod
