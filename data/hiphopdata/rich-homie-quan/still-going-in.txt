Yeah, aye, aye 
 I said they heard that I'm a boss, I gotta motherfucking prove it 
 Freezer full a niggas, she like "Quan, you the coolest" 
 Bitch, you watching me like a motherfucking movie 
 I got four hoes a piece in the pool and my jacuzzi, toothless 
 'Cause I'm spitting like a motherfucking infant, ruthless 
 Top gone and I'm ridin' on skinnies, Coupes 
 Her top gone and she hidin' behind the tinted, dueces 
 To them fuck niggas who never thought I wouldn't be shit 
 On some G shit, MOB shit, that Louie V on me 
 And I keep it like a free bitch, that Glock 40 on me (not you niggas) 
 And I'm back off in the kitchen, you don't know about it 
 The crack having itching, just like poison ivy 
 I got GPS bullets that will go and find him 
 Name a nigga better than me, I'm a go and sign him 
 All my niggas eye to eye, never go behind him 
 Tell yo ho remind him, chop and screw rewind him 
 Okay now, since it's hard to find me, binoculars see me farther 
 In trap like a spider, my name should be Peter Parker 
 Blowing that Mary Jane while popping them green goblins 
 Dora hanging off the hinges from keeping them fiends knocking 
 I got ounces in my jean pocket, that's how we rocking 
 With a check like Nike I could never Rebok it 
 If Nard ain't got no more 82, he gone have to ship it 
 Geometric numbers call me the math mathematician 
 I'm a add it, then subtract it, move the pack in the fastest 
 Stretch it backwards, like elastic, dramatic 
 Money covo I can hear a hater 
 Did I forget the baking soda in the refrigerator 
 I'm still going in on these nigga's asses 
 I'm still going in on these nigga's asses 
 I refuse to grab a pen on these nigga's asses 
 I got the torch now and I don't know if I'm a pass it 
 I'm still going in on these nigga's asses 
 I'm still going in on these nigga's asses 
 I refuse to grab a pen on these nigga's asses 
 I got the torch now and I don't know if I'm a pass it
