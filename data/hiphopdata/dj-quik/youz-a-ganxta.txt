Siide! Oh no, it's '98 y'all and we got some new shit 
 What we say? Yes ha ha fade the world in this motherfucker 
 That's right oh, check it out 
 -1- 
 Fuck what ya heard baby I'm DJ Quik 
 Whether on TV or in these streets I'm still the shit 
 I went from drinkin' eight ball and makin' demos 
 To drinkin' Hennessey and Chivas Regal in the back of the limo 
 Gettin' my issue in life you can't hate that 
 And when I tell you about yo' self nigga you can't take that 
 'Cause y'all be cross fadin' if you don't understand 
 You got a side and I got one but you be crossin' 
 Over here to see what's in my hand 
 Yeah but that's cool too I gets my money on the double 
 That's what I do hittin' them brown bubbles and avoidin' trouble 
 Hoes to choose with nothin' to lose 
 And a million mothafuckas wanna be in my shoes 
 But you don't understand, beyond the parties and cheer 
 I been broke my whole career breakin' bread with my peers 
 Bought a '96 Impala the new SS 
 Before the 20,000 mile mark I gave it to Sid 
 I could never bust a new shoe if my nephews ain't got 'em 
 Fila Jumpman Cortez yeah I'm comin' out the pocket 
 For my homies in the 'hood up on it when I'm around 
 'Cause there's a difference between bein' a thug and bein' down now 
 Bang bang boogie da bang da bang boogie to da 
 Boogie bang boogie da bang fuck what you sayin' nigga 
 You's a gangsta! 
 No I'm not! 
 Nigga you's a gangsta! 
 No I'm not! 
 Nigga you's a gangsta! 
 -2- 
 Just 'cause I kick it with killers don't mean that I do it 
 My occupation's a musician & I'm stayin' true to it 
 I went from bein' a rider to bein' a provider 
 While I was straddlin' the fence tryin' not to hit the divider 
 Just an impressionable human being tryin' to do right 
 Every now and then I get my manhood tested in fights 
 Like I used to have a beef with this cat named Eiht 
 And his homies approached me at the club El Rey 
 What was I to do I'm on stage & I'm doin' my thang 
 And this nigga's out in the crowd tryin' to hoo' bang 
 Givin' it up for his homies and set trippin' too 
 But he wasn't from Rollin' 60's more like Tragney 
 I wonder what's his problem what he tryin' to say 
 Is this business personal or just Fuck Quik Day? 
 I approached him like a man and not like a nut 
 He turned around and put his drink down and straight knuckled up 
 In the dark club punches is flyin' all around 
 And even though it was me and him the rumors went 'round 
 And said I killed somebody now how that sound 
 How could I stomp somebody to death that's bigger than me 
 And I'm just a hundred and fifty five pounds tell me 
 -3- 
 See some don't realize the power of lyrics 
 'Cause when you rap about death you talkin' to spirits 
 You see you can say the things that can help us all ball 
 Or you can say things that make it bad for us all 
 Fix the problem the only way is come to the source 
 Don't be a Trojan Horse help us change the course 
 Everybody knows that it's bad in the 'hood 
 So check what you rappin' about if it ain't to the good 
 I did my part a long time ago I changed my views 
 Ain't no gang bangin' and slangin' just hangin' with trues 
 Give it up to my Creator and that you can quote 
 But mothafuckas still see me as a scapegoat 
 Yeah like that night when Biggie died at Quincy Jones spot 
 Like 400 other people yeah I heard some shots 
 Broke away with the crowd nervous obviously 
 And the mothafuckas blamed it on me 
 What the hell!?! 
 Check it out this song is dedicated to the two most prolific writers 
 In rap music history Tupac Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G. 
 It's also dedicated to the little homie from 60's 
 That lost his life at that party 
 Rest in peace y'all 
 And to MC Eiht when you get yo' head together maybe we can do a record 
 Feel me I'm out 
 <DJ scratches> Bang bang (till fade)
