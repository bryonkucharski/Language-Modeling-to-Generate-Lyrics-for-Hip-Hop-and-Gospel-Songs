Oh 
 Tonight I want to get started 
 Do what I came to do 
 I see you checkin' 
 But see, I'm not really checkin' for you, no 
 I want to sit back 
 Join baby, have a drink or two 
 (That's what I've come to do) 
 So don't come spit 'cause that's not what I'm about 
 Not tonight, I'm cool, yeah, yeah 
 No, I'm not really lookin' (Mmm) 
 Just came to have a good time (I'm not) 
 Don't wanna get too serious (No, hey) 
 That's not what's on my mind (Not what's on my mind) 
 No, I'm not really lookin' (Hey) 
 That's not what's on my plan (Not my plan) 
 Don't wanna be with you tonight (Hey) 
 Not lookin' for no man (No man, no man, no man) 
 Another day in the nightlife 
 In a club, tryin' to get away from my wife 
 With my ladies, introduce them to a mad world 
 And I saw you side step 'em, you's a bad girl 
 Look at you sittin' on a stool at the bar, you's a 
 Young star 
 With your own crib, own chips, and own car 
 But you're starin' at my nephew are 
 Like you're makin' me jealous, but you ain't knowin' 
 Me 
 Fellas, what you gonna tell us 
 You must be thinkin' that my mack ain't tired 
 I'm pimpin', you're turnin' your back, baby, you ain't 
 Right 
 You better ask this bartender 
 That be holdin' a platinum American Express Corporate 
 With stars in them 
 With that Cris' in your clutch 
 Fooled by the bull, by the bull too much 
 How come we can't get into some bubble s*** 
 Some of that old get naked, get in trouble s*** (Mmm, 
 Oh, no, I'm not really lookin' ('Cause I'm not) 
 Just came to have a good time (No, no) 
 Don't wanna get too serious (No) 
 That's not what's on my mind (That's not what's on my 
 Mind) 
 Yes, I'm not really lookin' 
 That's not what's on my plan (No) 
 Don't wanna be with you tonight 
 Not lookin' for no man 
 Come this party and I'm not tryin' to stop 
 Ho, beggars don't be wylin', make 'em shut down the 
 Spot, oh, no 
 So baby, just cool out, that's not what this is about 
 Come feel me on this flow, I'm not just sayin' no 
 No, I'm not really lookin' (No) 
 Just came to have a good time (Good time) 
 Don't wanna get too serious (Hey, oh) 
 That's not what's on my mind (On my mind, yeah) 
 No, I'm not really lookin' 
 That's not what's on my plan (Not my plan) 
 Don't wanna be with you tonight 
 Not lookin' for no man (No man) 
 No, I'm not really lookin' (I'm not) 
 Just came to have a good time 
 Don't wanna get too serious ('Cause it's a party) 
 That's not what's on my mind 
 No, I'm not really lookin' (I) 
 That's not what's on my plan (I) 
 Don't wanna be with you tonight 
 Not lookin' for no man 
 (No man) 
 No, no man
