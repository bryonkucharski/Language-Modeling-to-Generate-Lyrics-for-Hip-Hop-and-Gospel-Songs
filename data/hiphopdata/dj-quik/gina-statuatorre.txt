(DJ Quik) 
 She wanna, put on her favorite CD and take it off 
 She wanna, get up on top of some D and make it soft 
 She wanna, ride around off in my big beige Coupe 
 But she don't wanna go and kick it with her own age group 
 She wanna, hit the dodo till it make hers eyes tight 
 But her, I.D. photo picture's on the right side 
 So I, told her "get somewhere and jump you some hoop 
 Or hop some jax with your buddies 'stead of flirtin' with folks 
 She wanna, smuggle Gin off in the club in her purse 
 She wanna, be the one to say that she hit it first 
 She wanna, hold the record for the most play things 
 That she done stuffed off in her nani 'fore the age 18 
 She wanna, pierce her navel till it hurts like hell 
 And play it off and pierce her tongue too 'cause she like girls 
 She wanna, wrap her leg around the pole and go spin 
 Until them pills that she swallowed really start to kick in... 
 She wanna, ride in a Bentley 'cause she heard they the bomb 
 She wanna, lick on a sucker till her lips get numb 
 She wanna, find a goldie that she know she can dig 
 And then go eat some grits and eggs until her ass gets big 
 She wanna, go adjust that look to fix her hair 
 Then go take some pictures sittin' in that wicker chair 
 She wanna, let the pimpin' know she down to bone 
 But when it come to her I.D. she done forgot it at home 
 She wanna, knock a O.G., tell her girls she done got him 
 Then go into vivid detail 'bout his two-minute problem 
 She wanna, drop her peachy folder down on the ground 
 And then go get a Maxim magazine to show that she's down 
 She wanna, let these players know that she ain't no kid 
 So go put this wristband on bitch so we know who you is 
 She want a diamond bracelet, a diamond necklace 
 A diamond party at thr Diamond Club with a diamond checklist...
