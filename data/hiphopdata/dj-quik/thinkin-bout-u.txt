(DJ Quik talking) 
 Ha ha nothin' but the best, from the best 
 You feel me? hear me 
 This is dedicated to that special someone 
 You know who you are, and you never gave me a chance 
 I used to watch you walk to class, fine as can be 
 While I'm standing here with K.K. and D 
 And I did a liitle bit of everything just to get your attention 
 But I knew you had no eyes for me 
 I used to get up, sharpen my pencil for nothin' 
 You watch me watch you rollin' your eyes and you still was bumpin 
 So when test time came I was all in yours 
 With no bubbles on my papers just some low ass scores 
 I guess you can call it puppy love I was a scrub 
 Having fantasies of me and you up in my tub 
 Makin' love in the soapy water, having my daughter 
 But I knew you liked them baller dudes and, I did'nt have a quarter 
 I admit on the rainy days it was sad 
 Cause it was'nt about who you was but what you had 
 Now I'm doing swell baby and you know it's true 
 Back when you had a chance you should've let me breath on you 
 Sittin' in my room thinkin' 'bout you 
 Reminiscing on the kinky little things we did'nt do 
 I said I'm sitting in my room thinkin' thinkin' thinkin' 
 I'm Sittin' in my room thinkin' 'bout you 
 Reminiscing on the kinky little things we did'nt do 
 I said I'm sitting in my room thinkin' thinkin' thinkin' 
 Now I called you on the telephone baby it's david 
 The last you gave a chance is the first to save it 
 And I'm just tryin' to hook us up for another session 
 Because I have'nt learned my lesson 
 Plus I got positions never ending 
 Now I'm descending down into your valley baby work your tendons 
 Doing what I do to make you do what you did 
 To make me come so hard that we almost had a kid 
 Platinum That's how I descibe your thigh 
 Tell me how come your so young doin' shit that fly 
 You must have came from the school of hard knocks 
 Lickin' on hard rocks and blowin' off tube socks 
 Now whenever it's time for fun 
 You got me blowin' up your pager with 911's ha 
 Now show me a little affection 
 But hurry up before I lose my erection 
 Because I'm siitin on my couch thinkin' 'bout you 
 Reminiscin on the kinky little things we used to do 
 I said I'm sittin' on my couch thinkin' thinkin' thinkin' 
 I said I'm siitin on my couch thinkin' 'bout you 
 Reminiscin on the kinky little things we used to do 
 I said I'm sittin' on my couch thinkin' thinkin' thinkin' 
 (Check it out) 
 And now I'm sittin' in my spa thinkin' 'bout you 
 And you baby doll don't even have a clue 
 I'm just sittin' in my spa thinkin' thinkin' 'bout you 
 I said I'm sittin' in my spa thinkin' 'bout you 
 And I'm doin' rather swell in ???? heaven yeah it's true 
 I'm just sittin' in my spa thinkin' thinkin' thinkin' 
 And that's real good night baby
