Quik: 
 Ha ha yeah check it out money and pussy make the world go 'round 
 (That's right) That's how it's been since the beginning of time. 
 Now who says we can't be fly? 
 Who say Compton niggas can't get they scrilla 
 At the same time get some thigh 
 Well uh that's the subject of my conversation 
 Cause ain't nothin' like gettin' a dollar and some penetration 
 Now that's a whole lot easier to understand now a days 
 But uh some of you playas still be going out sideways 
 So umm just take this game with a tic tac 
 'Cause if you was on Skid Row you can get 
 Pussy faster than a Big Mac 
 I owe it to myself to be fly that's what Top Dog taught a boy 
 Cause instead of Mounds these bitches always want Almond Joy 
 Because uh "Sometimes they feel like a nut" 
 But they rather have it more often than they don't 
 So I won't go flippin' and makin' it topsy turvy 
 Now keep my hundred dollar bills crisp and that ass curvy 
 Cause ain't nothin' on my mind but to be fly through time 
 Havin' a nest egg bird behind an estate that's mine 
 Watchin' Jordan go for forty in a sucker tub 
 Eatin' Cheetos drinkin' Mo' and getting a back scrub 
 Because first you get the power then you get the money 
 Then you get the pussy dude don't be no dummy uh 
 Chorus El Debarge: 
 Playas get they paper when they game is tight 
 And if you want some nana that's for you to decide 
 But as long as you ain't simpin' then ya doin' it right 
 'Cause together they go hand in hand Oh yeah 
 D: 
 She wanna make me break code but I can't 
 I wanna fire it up and hit it pass it like dank 
 Baby all in my square big buddha long hair 
 Fly Chinese and Black for a mack plus player 
 D baby I'ma get ya hot wanna get ya full blown 
 So we all can hit the spot (now you gotta shake the spot) 
 Got game by the tons lookin' for some 2nd II None 
 Kinda fun but these hookers on the run for cover 
 They lookin' for lovers ain't no trickin' young D 
 'Cause I'm unlike the others not a buster 
 I'm on the mission for figures time up for you diggers 
 (Now who got the Henn'?) Pass the liquor 
 Hoes hear the name it get's 'em hotter 
 Spin a scraggler on a wheel now they call me D the Potter 
 Lotta hatin' going on but I ain't with it 
 I'ma mash on that drama every time that I feel it 
 'Cause I'd rather have a major end than have sex 
 And when I have a million to splurge you know what's next 
 But first you get the power then you get the money 
 Then you get the pussy fool don't be no dummy 
 El Debarge talking: 
 Yeah first comes the power then the money heh 
 And if you really just want it the 
 Na na na na la di da na na na la di da 
 KK: 
 I understand that you think you grown 
 Independant on ya own with ya jazzy ways 
 My intent is ya lay but first I'm out to get paid not played 
 Can't be yo' incredible edible egg 
 I don't crack nor split my yolk with the female folk 
 Now baby break yourself get broke you can choke 
 Off this young black better than Mary Jane 
 In ya brain I'm guaranteed to have ya thinkin' and feelin' thangs 
 Like yourself now uh watch ya health if ya feel like plottin' 
 Ya body turns rotten from the inside out that pussy's turned out 
 Getting hit by a sucker a 2 minute brother 
 Who's first 10 seconds is thinkin' he came up 
 That next full minute suckin ya drama up 
 50 seconds to go see half of that is the show 
 Now where the other half you can't laugh 
 'Cause you know it's straight simpin' and whinin' 
 'Stead of pimpin' and grindin' KK'll let you know 
 So pay attention bro 
 See first you get the power then you get the money 
 Then you get the pussy don't be the dummy though
