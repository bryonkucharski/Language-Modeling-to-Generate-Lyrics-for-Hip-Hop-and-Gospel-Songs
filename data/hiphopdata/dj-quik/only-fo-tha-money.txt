(DJ quik) 
 Sometimes I just don't even understand 
 Why people like this dirty talkin' shit, youknowhati'msayin? 
 But since they do and people buyin this shit; 
 I'ma kick it like this 
 You see a pimpin' ass nigga like me is wanted dead or alive 
 Because I jack these hooker hoes for they ten's and they five's 
 And twenty's then I leave 'em branded, 'cause I'm the love bandit 
 I'm not tryin' to be mean I want your green or you'll be stranded 
 Cause you know it don't pay to play for free yo 
 So you shit out of luck, I need a buck to fuck 
 You duck, hoe, bitch, tramp 
 And I don't take no food stamps 
 This is a reminder - I'm lettin you know that if I get behind ya 
 You're gonna have to kick up - or eat a dick up till you hiccup 
 I treat yo' ass as if this was a stick up 
 Cause you ain't nothin' but a pick-up 
 Trick hell yeah I'm offensive 
 A spin around the bend can be expensive 
 And the effects'll be, they can be extensive 
 So if I gotta fuckin' take a chance, I want my grip in advance 
 Because it's only fo' tha money 
 Chorus: repeat 4x 
 Dolla bill y'all, dolla bill y'all 
 Dolla dolla dolla dolla dolla bill y'all 
 (2nd ii none #1) 
 Now that I fucked, I want my motherfuckin cut 
 Oh yeah, I'm a hoe, what you think I gave you the dick fo'? 
 See I can play the bitch, but see I ain't the bitch 
 You better checkin' her in, and better do it quick 
 See the devil made me do it, cause devil is you 
 'Cause I done seen all the shit you took niggaz through 
 But not me wench, you cute saditty skanch 
 Think I'ma be the trick nigga, well bitch I ain't 
 'Cause I'm the type of nigga that can get your cock 
 Without payin' you, but straight be playin' you 
 Bitch - I thought you knew better than that 
 See it only fucks you up, when your weak game lacks 
 Manipulatin moves like I do (like I do) 
 See it just goes to show you hoe you can't play a true 
 See I can leave your broke-ass fast with your cock all runny 
 (Beeeitch) 'cause it's only fo' tha money 
 (2nd ii none #2) 
 Now that you know me, I'm only out to leave you broke and lonely 
 I find a stupid hoe and talk her ass to matrimony 
 Now I can be cool until we hitched 
 But I'ma switch up on my role and play the motherfuckin bitch 
 Waitin for the mailman to come around 
 Oh youse a low-down nigga - naw man, I'm just a money hound 
 I play the roll well, check out my limp 
 Yeah, I'm the county check pimp (aww that's you baby) 
 Slangin my hand inside your purse 
 Girl you better keep cool cause the shit can get worse, damn 
 Yo' check is short, I ain't gon' sweat, huh 
 I take the kids lunch money, yeah - bet 
 And borrow ends from yo' family and grin 
 I just gotta keep my bankroll comin' in 
 And then I kick back and laugh 'cause it's funny 
 Ha ha - I only did it fo' tha money
