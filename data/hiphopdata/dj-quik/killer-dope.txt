How come y'all niggas bitter? Hatin' so much 
 You wanna be up in my hair, but you can't clean your brush 
 Shit evaporate, you just exacerbate 
 What makes my sex life great, you gotta masturbate 
 Your hair is fallin' out, my hair is growin' in 
 I put my hair in curls and put yours in a garbage bin 
 Then play piano on stage, live while I rhyme 
 And you niggas can't even bounce and rap all the time (I think I got it) 
 I bet Eazy-E is turnin' over in his grave, to see that some of y'all made gangsta rap gay (gay) 
 I got a brand new HK, and I sniper practice each and every day (okay) 
 My mama's conversation on the phone, short wit' me 
 I think she wants to have a heart-to-heart wit' me 
 I told her I would kill you niggas smartfully 
 I'm the star player; you can't start for me 
 Play that Quik shit, and get 'em all sparked 
 Everywhere from Aard Park down to Carver Park 
 I keep it avenue, I'm bringing brothers hope 
 Liquid change colours, that's that killer dope 
 The street never changes, only faces do 
 Every several years, it replaces you 
 I get the people loaded, when they can't cope 
 Put me on the burner, got that killer dope 
 I be all precision like the Temptations men, before Paul Williams' replacement stint 
 Or rehabilitation with the name is, my drinking situation is the same as his 
 Attention deficit 'cause I don't pay you none 
 I got the word before you came in, they say you done 
 Trying to fix your pockets with some broken tools 
 You run a broken school, full of broken fools 
 Now go and clean out your desk 
 Take your name plaque with you while they clean out the rest 
 I'm the new executive movement I'm beating my chest 
 And I'm a mess, I digress 
 That I'm too mature for the job I got, too young for the one I want 
 Two won when my cards go flop, give all my homeboys a blunt 
 'Cause the point is, two spliffs or double jointed 
 Now let's all go get high on my enemy's supply 
 I gotta be simply one of the greatest, one of the hardest 
 One of the smartest, one of the brightest 
 One of the ones who helped start all this 
 Some niggas eatin' simply because I chose to be an artist 
 Way back when I was homeless, way back when I was carless 
 Way back when my sisters used to kick me out their apartments 
 They back with their hands out, but they made me so heartless 
 I don't even put cans out, I ain't tryin' to donate 
 I ain't giving you bitches loans, this ain't no fuckin' bank 
 I ain't no house nigga, like- 
 If this is UAC music then what makes this so awful 
 I'm back with the strap in my lap, I'm back in the hood with the gat 
 I'm back with the drink in my trunk, don't think so I'll drink till I'm drunk 
 I'm back in the kitchen, slow roastin' a lesson 
 And I play my own piano, don't call y'all for no sessions 
 I'm a threat and a blessin', known to keep cowards stressin' 
 While I'm relaxin' at the shooting range releasin' aggression 
 Now tell me how you want it
