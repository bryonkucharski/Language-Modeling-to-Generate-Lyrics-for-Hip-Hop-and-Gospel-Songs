DJ Quik: 
 What you say hammer? Proper 
 Where are the real women? [x8] 
 This raps grand national 
 DJ Quik and Jon B 
 I ain't down to Earth I'm in a stratus and I love it 
 Too many broke haters in the city not above it 
 Yeah I'm self-made, that's a scholar 
 If you didn't listen one in one thousand gettin' free 
 Where is your tuition 
 I think I need a maid 
 'Cause I'm kinda getting paid 
 And I don't feel like cleaning up 
 I'm going through a phase 
 So I look for all my days 
 To be enjoyed with a women like me so... 
 Jon B & DJ Quik: 
 Where are the real women? (Where are you ladies) 
 Show me the real women (Where are you ladies) 
 Where are the real women? (Where are you ladies) 
 Show me the real women 
 DJ Quik: 
 I drink Pellegrino water guess it's something about the bubbles 
 Do you want the simple life or do you want trouble? 
 Do you want the hood or do you want the good? 
 And don't you wanna be treated like classy women should? 
 No imitation Louie, Diamonds like Club Louie 
 Closet overflowin' all Jimmy Choo's shoey 
 Float you like a buoy 
 Spend without a limit 
 I'm seeking out the woman that them other women mimic 
 So Proper 
 Jon B & DJ Quik: 
 I need a proper girl (Proper) 
 Proper love (Proper) 
 Proper touch (Proper) 
 And someone, with a proper smile (Proper) 
 Proper style (Proper) 
 She got class 
 Proper Woman 
 Jon B & DJ Quik: 
 Where are the real women? (Where you at?) 
 Show me the real women (Where you is?) 
 Where are the real women? (Where you be baby?) 
 Show me the real women 
 DJ Quik: 
 ...And furthermore 
 I give you space let you breathe 
 Won't be tugging at ya sleeve 
 I ain't peeking in your phone 
 I'm mature, I'm grown 
 And although you got your flaws 
 We won't make that an issue 
 I take you to the mall and hold this Louie purse against you 
 See how it match your shoes and how it change ya mood 
 All your girlfriends see me as a really player dude 
 I show up to your job with the keys to something new 
 And leave you hella happy that's exactly what I do 
 The world calls me Q 
 But my letter don't work unless it's followed by a "U" 
 You, will never find love in the club 
 No, neither will I too 
 And that's cool 
 I'm just being me, baby this is what it do 
 Jon B & DJ Quik: 
 I need a proper girl (Proper) 
 Proper love (Proper) 
 Proper touch 
 And someone (Woman) 
 Proper style (Proper) 
 She got class (proper) 
 Proper Love

 Show me the real women (Where you is)
