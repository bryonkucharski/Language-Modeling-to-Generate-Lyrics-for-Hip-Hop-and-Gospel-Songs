Hook - DJ Quik impersonating Suga Free: 
 I don't need nobody, I don't want nobody 
 I don't care about nobody, they don't care about me 
 I don't need nobody, I don't want nobody 
 I don't care about nobody, I just care about me 
 Suga Free: 
 Ay pimpin', this for that trick mayne 
 Yeah, the one that laughed at me when I told 'em God was sendin' me a boat, but then he cried when DJ Quik came 
 A day in the life of a playa name Free 
 When John Mayer told the world he didn't CARE for me 
 But look at Obama in the office for the get back, mayne 
 I believe in takin', go to school and GET that game 
 Dark brown Cognac to the head 
 You can't tell me shit, nigga Michael Jackson dead 
 I'm holding back my tears when I'm listenin' to "Off the Wall" 
 That medicine didn't kill 'em - y'all did cause y'all talked about him like a dog 
 No, I ain't pickin' up no girl for no security, Jack 
 Didn't Paris Hilton finally get her jewelry back? 
 And Tiger Woods needs some back-up 
 Boy, don't you ever apologize to no prostitute, now hit the green and tee THAT up 
 But let a mack get 'er; 
 'Member that sex scene on "Baby Boy"? I woulda fucked them hoes just like Jack 
 Now I'm a kiss the ground like a 747 stack 
 Cause success is the greatest revenge, but it's gon' back 
 (It's gon' handle what's right, it's so certificate 
 Then you better believe in me) 
 Yeah, so rack 'em up 
 Yeah, Suga Free the P, man 
 Pomona style, man have them niggas crackin' up 
 So don't rush me 
 I don't drink alcohol, but when I do drink I prefer Dos Equis

 DJ Quik: 
 Now my life, is backstage, wristbands, flashlights 
 Then, do the same thing we did last night - Jam 
 I'm retro Nickelodeon, I'm still All That 
 I even rock the mane just like Mike Jack 
 Addicted to the night life just like crack 
 But in the black Mercedes with the ladies in the back 
 I like to make you brick, it's what makes me tick 
 The way the team decided by just one kick 
 Now do the grand slam, damn 
 Take you back so far, I got you flyin' Pan Am 
 I get the club packed tight like canned ham 
 Sealin' all your artists, now pass your exam 
 Or get down or gon' get it knit up 
 I got a Quincy Jones in my bones, genes split-up 
 DJ Quiksta in the center like a pent-up 
 And I don't break down - I been up
