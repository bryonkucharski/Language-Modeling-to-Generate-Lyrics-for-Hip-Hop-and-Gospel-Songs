Quik: 
 My name is Quik & I be moving fast like a race car 
 But I'm top seed #1 like the pace car 
 Whether you up on me or you chillin' way far 
 You can tell almost immediately that I'm aced off 
 So listen muthafucka why you comin' off hard 
 My objective is to catch you off guard 
 Get covert and infiltrate yo' clique 
 Crack yo' shit and mack yo' bitch 
 Now tell me could you conceive a nigga all up in her beaver 
 Givin' her the love fever for hours at a time before I take a breather 
 And when she tell me she loves me I don't believe her 
 'Cause I rock in stereo or mono hot like gonno- 
 Rhea burnin' every time you take a pee uh 
 So when you see a nigga out with his girl 
 Then baby play like you don't know me and we'll keep in a twirl 
 Because baby I go deeper than the deep blue seas 
 Baby do you really wanna play the flute on me? 
 I'll give you a sack and take it back and you'll die to get it 
 Little punk 'cause I'm fly with it 
 When we come up we gettin' down down down 
 Step in the club they give us pound pound pound 
 Lookin' for somethin' that be nice brown and round 
 DJ Quik and AMG with a brand new sound 
 AMG: 
 I told her don't chase it but you can place it 
 In between your jaws to taste it 
 Or leave it in the basement 
 I be the riddler that's too familiar get in the middle of ya 
 And then I diddle ya, dick ya down till it tickles 
 Smack the booty with no pimples 
 Caress ya back then rub ya nipples 
 Baby I'm a crack fiend get the KY and if I'm at a jiggalo 
 Baby say hi fly like a eagle in a Range Rover or a Regal 
 Lookin' for the party people and when I catch ya baby girl 
 You should feel lucky we can make love 
 But don't forget to fuck me 
 'Cause you got more bounce than Roger Troutman 
 I don't know when it's in or out and 
 Soak me baby give me that good thang 
 Ain't nothin' wrong with a coochie bang 
 'Cause Suga Free, Mausberg, Quik and the AM 
 Definitely knows how to play 'em 
 'Cause we went from demos to limos to luxuriousies 
 To models from Milan on they knees 
 When we come up we gettin' down down down 
 Step in the club they give us pound pound pound 
 Lookin' for somethin' that be nice brown and round 
 AMG and Mausberg with a brand new sound 
 Mausberg: 
 Oh you didn't know that I'm the bomb baby 
 Well take a toke of this D-I- & you gon' be feelin' flizie 
 'Cause I be's Mausberg the superior 
 Steppin' through the club pound pound so ya fearin' us 
 But don't trip we keep the vibe right 
 Baby buy me some Remy and if 
 Yo' baby daddy trippin' tell him beep me 
 'Cause I be's Black and Tone and swift up on my toes 
 G'd up in alligate's and steel toes 
 Can I get a pound pound? (pound pound) 
 If Free the flyest who am I? (You the realest) 
 Look into my eyes and tell me what do you see 
 Oh you jockin' my entourage DJ Quik and AMG 
 Well get yo' groove on 'cause I ain't hatin' on the homies 
 When that 9-5th drop you and yo' sister gon' be on me 
 All I wanna do is slide up in and slide back out 
 Slap you in yo' face and stick it dead in yo' mouth 
 You think I'm bullshittin' well meet me after my show 
 Bring yo' lips to that all white stretch limo 
 So we can ride, slide, dip and glide Booyah! 
 And do our thang 'cause my whole clique fly 
 When we come up we gettin' down down down 
 Step in the club they give us pound pound pound 
 Lookin' for somethin' that be nice brown and round 
 Mausberg and Suga Free with a brand new sound 
 Suga Free: 
 It feel good don't it? 
 It ain't no good if it ain't good enough 
 To put the proper good on it 
 Peep how I struck up bitch jump in the air 
 Stay there until I tell you come down 
 And when you do you shut the fuck up 
 She'll sell a nice dream but bitch you'll 
 Have better luck tryin' to find 2 Pac than 
 Me buying you somethin' off the ice cream truck 
 Oxygen you leave 'lone leave me 'lone 
 Before I lock you in that little bitty box again 
 Don't let up y'all just keep her soakin' wet up 
 Playa playa and tell her when she need to shut up 
 Don't lighten up naw nigga you better you better tighten up 
 Throw ya head back back back back 
 Lean it to the side hey playas (Yeah!) 
 Tell 'em that we fly (We fly!) Ooh catastrophe! 
 Bitch rather slide down a slide of razor blades 
 Into a pool of pimp piss but this hoe had the audacity 
 To ask me for a dollar even though that's all I had left 
 These greedy lying ass hoes'll fifty cents yo' ass to death! 
 When we come up we gettin' down down down 
 Step in the club they give us pound pound pound 
 Lookin' for somethin' that be nice brown and round 
 And we come to hit the world with a brand new sound
