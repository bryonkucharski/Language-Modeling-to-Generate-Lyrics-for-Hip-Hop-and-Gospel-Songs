Oh 
 Feels like I'm on a high speed chase 
 Running from the pressure of my day 
 Into your arms 
 I can escape 
 You make it ok 
 That's why I'm swtching lanes I 
 Ain't trying to play no games I 
 Can't wait to sit between your legs 
 While your legs 
 While you're massaging away 
 Girl I 
 Don't think you know how much I adore you 
 But when I'm finished 
 Girl I promise that you're going to 
 So in the meantime 
 Girl just be patient 
 And know that I'm accelerating. 
 Through everything but that red light 
 Going downtown (going downtown) 
 I got to see my baby 
 You way ahead of the game 
 You got me riding like vroom 
 On a yamaha 
 Chromed out 1100 
 Racing to your love 
 Cause you got my motor running 
 Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom 
 You know I'm trying to get to 
 You, you, you, you 
 You know that I want you girl 
 Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom 
 You know I gotta get to 
 You, you, you, you 
 Get to you 
 Get to you 
 Now the anticipation taking over 
 Girl I gotta beat this song up for your love 
 I'm getting closer 
 Got me steady reminiscing 'bout your touch 
 I swear 
 Nights like this 
 I wish 
 That I had a private jet 
 So I can get where you are 
 I can feel us getting closer 
 Girl this love's just taking over 
 And I'm hotter than the heat anymore 
 Wanna beat it and I know you feel the same 
 Don't cha 
 Now that I'm only five minutes away 
 It's ok 
 Crack open that champagne 
 And get ready baby 
 Going downtown (going downtown) 
 I got to see my baby 
 You way ahead of the game 
 You got me riding like vroom 
 On a yamaha 
 Chromed out eleven hundred 
 Racing to your love 
 Cause you got my motor running 
 Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom 
 You know I'm trying to get to 
 You, you, you, you 
 You know that I want you girl 
 Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom 
 You know I gotta get to 
 You, you, you, you 
 Get to you 
 Get to you 
 Rev it up 
 Rev it up 
 I'm overlooking stop lights 
 (Aww) rev it up 
 Rev it up 
 I hope the ones ain't out tonight 
 Rev it up 
 Rev it up 
 I can only imagine 
 What you got on 
 As soon as I open the door 
 Hurry up 
 I'm right out front 
 Rev it up 
 I hear slow jams bumping 
 Hurry up 
 Almost to your door 
 Girl I feel line running into your arms 
 Girl here I come 
 To you 
 And it was worth the wait 
 Going downtown (going downtown) 
 I got to see my baby 
 You way ahead of the game 
 You got me riding like vroom 
 On a yamaha 
 Chrome out eleven hundred 
 Racing to your love 
 Cause you got my motor running 
 Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom 
 You know I'm trying to get to 
 You, you, you, you 
 You know that I want you girl 
 Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom 
 You know I gotta get to 
 You, you, you, you 
 Get to you 
 Grt to you 
 Baby 
 Baby 
 Baby
