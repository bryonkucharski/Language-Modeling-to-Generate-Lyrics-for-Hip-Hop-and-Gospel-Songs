Go head from the top! 
 Yeah. Ye! 
 Turn my music up (Ha) 
 Is y'all wit me? 
 You know, I can feel your presence 
 Come closer 
 Yeah 
 You turn me on 
 You flip the switch 
 I feel the current 
 Pushin me, pullin me 
 Cloooose to you 
 Shocks in my system 
 There's an attraction 
 Look how I'm actin' 
 Hard for me to keep my coooool 
 Vibratiooooons 
 Feel it in my chest! (feel that? haha) 
 When we toooooouch 
 There's a charge I get! 
 (Uh, you feel that? I feel that) 
 There is an energy 
 That I just can't control (It's electric) 
 When it takes over me 
 I let myself go! 
 (It's electric, oh, so, so electric) 
 Let's start some static 
 A bit of friction 
 Feel so magnetic 
 Pullin me more into youuuu! Ho! 
 I got you open 
 The waves are flowin 
 So now you're glowin' 
 I knew you were feelin' me toooo! 
 Vibratiooooons 
 Feel it in my chest! (ah, you feel that?) 
 When we toooooouch 
 There's a charge I geeeeet! Woo! 
 There is an energy (energy) 
 That I just can't control (Ooh, oh) 
 When it takes over me (Over me, ooh) 
 I let myself go! 
 (It's electric, oh, so, so electric) 
 It lives inside of me (all right) 
 A separate (ye!) entity 
 I can hear it's heart beat 
 It's electric, It's electric, It's electric! 
 WOO! 
 There is an energy (energy!) 
 That I just can't control (I just can't controool, no no!) 
 When it takes over me (Over meee! Yeah!) 
 I let myself go! 
 Oh! 
 Woo! 
 Oh no! 
 Aha! 
 Oh! 
 Give it to me! 
 You gotta watch me! 
 'Cause you know I'm dancin right! 
 It's electric 
 He! 
 Yeah 
 Stop that beat - keep it going 
 Yeah, keep that
