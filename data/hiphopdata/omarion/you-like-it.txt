You been showing me signs 
 You been blowing me kisses 
 You been trying to be mine 
 Girl, I'm down if you're with it 
 But you know I got a girl 
 And I know you got a man 
 But there's one thing you need to understand 
 I don't give a damn about how he feels 
 You shouldn't give a damn about how she feels 
 'Cause you and me know what we got is real 
 So we should quit playing, and close the deal 
 Girl I know that you like it you like it you like it 
 And you know that I like it I like it I like it 
 Girl I know that you like it you like it you like it 
 And you know that I like it I like it I like it 
 So I'ma get what I want 
 I ain't worried about nobody but you, girl 
 Come and get what you want 
 Ain't no need to fight it at all 
 Girl I know that you like it you like it you like it 
 And you know that I like it I like it I like it 
 Girl I know that you like it you like it you like it 
 And you know that I like it I like it I like it 
 I like the way you comb your hair 
 I like those stylish clothes you wear 
 It's just the little things you do 
 That show how much you really care 
 My girl she been playing them games 
 And you been dealing with a lame 
 We both be feeling the same 
 Fuck what she saying, fuck what he saying 
 Swerving, switching lanes. 
 Stead on up to the bank, 
 Counting the money we make. 
 Girl I know that you like it you like it you like it 
 And you know that I like it I like it I like it 
 Girl I know that you like it you like it you like it 
 And you know that I like it I like it I like it 
 So I'ma get what, I want 
 I ain't worried about nobody but you, girl 
 Come and get what you want 
 Ain't no need to fight it all 
 Girl I know that you like it you like it you like it 
 And you know that I like it I like it I like it 
 Girl I know that you like it you like it you like it 
 And you know that I like it I like it I like it 
 I like the way you comb your hair 
 I like those stylish clothes you wear 
 It's just the little things you do 
 That show how much you really care 
 Even though you got you someone 
 And I got someone 
 I can give you more, more 
 I can't stop thinking about you 
 Girl I want you 
 Tell me, am I wrong, wrong? 
 Girl, 'cause I been hoping, I been praying, I been wishing 
 That you say you love me, are you loving this decision 
 Girl I know you like it, and I like it 
 Let's not wait no more. 
 So I'ma get what, I want 
 I ain't worried about nobody but you, girl 
 Come and get what you want 
 Ain't no need to fight it all 
 Girl I know that you like it you like it you like it 
 And you know that I like it I like it I like it 
 Girl I know that you like it you like it you like it 
 And you know that I like it I like it I like it 
 You know I like it
