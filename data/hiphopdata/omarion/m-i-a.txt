Fuck her I'on care... 
 My new lady says she leaving me 
 Ah fuck her, I'on care 
 Plus I got another over there 
 She been wanting to be with me 
 Got her in her underwear 
 Gave her what she want, now she needin me 
 I got more of that coming over soon 
 Lingerie all up in my room 
 I'm a make this toast to that one girl I love 
 I still smell her perfume 
 Pour one up, no pour another 
 Pour one up, no pour another 
 Pour one up, no pour another 
 Numbing up 
 Since you've been away, love's been M.I.A. 
 Done looking for love, 'cause she took away her 
 Now I'm M.I.A., M.I.A., on love, on love 
 Done looking for love, 'cause she took away her love 
 Fuck her I'on care... 
 My new lady says she leaving me 
 Ah fuck her I don't care 
 Told me that she lovin' me, yeah 
 I just give them the scenery, they won't ever compare 
 To the ones still got it 
 I call her up but she won't answer 
 And she knows what I'm looking for 
 And she knows what I'm looking for 
 Pour one up, no pour another 
 Pour one up, no pour another 
 Pour one up, Now pour me up some 'cause I'm Numbing uppppp 
 Since you've been away, Love's been M.I.A. 
 Done looking for love, 'cause she took away her 
 Now I'm MIA, MIA, on love, on love 
 Done looking for love, 'cause she took away her love 
 I be a rolling stone, missus, still tryna deal with ya 
 Loving too much will leave you blue and I ain't pledge Sigma 
 I'm a real nigga, giving feelings just ain't me 
 The more attention you give em, the more options they seek 
 Talk is cheap, knew I should've kept the receipt 
 She said she loyal, but all bitches gon' talk in the streets 
 That's how I play it, how I play it, all it is is game 
 As I hit another paper plane I'm M.I.A.
