Looking back on it all I 
 (Wish you would've said something) 
 Before we got this far I (And I wouldn't be caught up in)

 I know 
 (I know you see me) See me on music TV, eh 
 (Your making money) Making money doing your thing 
 But I don't 
 I don't wanna up and leave and try to be what through the media says 
 I don't want something that's made for TV 
 Rather fall in love with a girl that's made for me 
 And I know everybody thinks that it 
 Might sound crazy but I 
 I love my baby, I can't leave her no 
 I don't want something that's 
 Made for TV (oh no I)

 I know you think I'm lying (Every time that I say) 
 I don't wanna see you crying all because of me oh 
 The thought of me and you is ill 
 But with her it's something real 
 And I can't let that go, oh no
