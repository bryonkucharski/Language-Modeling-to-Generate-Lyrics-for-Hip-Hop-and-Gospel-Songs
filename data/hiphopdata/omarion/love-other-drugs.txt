Falling 
 I thought you was everything I needed 
 Everything I wanted 
 Thought I found love, true love 
 Baby, girl you have my heart 
 I knew it from the start 
 'Cause it feels like love 
 Swear I didn't feel like running tonight 
 But I thought we made love 
 Suddenly woke up, feels like 
 Swear I saw you in my bed I know that perfume 
 Girl you messing with my head I be all confused 
 Tell me what's the difference between love and other drugs 
 Because in the end it all comes crashing down 
 Tell me what's the difference between love and other drugs 
 Baby girl you're just as dangerous 
 You keep me falling, keep me falling 
 Like I'm free falling, got me feeling like I'm falling 
 (Keep me falling) 
 High off love, feeling like I'm crashing 
 Into that ocean 
 Baby you got me surfing 
 And I can do it 
 You're the only one for me 
 Don't you leave me lonely 
 Baby I never do you that way 
 'Cause it feels like love 
 Swear I didn't feel like running tonight 
 But I thought we made love 
 Suddenly woke up, feels like 
 Swear I saw you in my bed I know that perfume 
 Girl you messing with my head I be all confused 
 Tell me what's the difference between love and other drugs 
 Because in the end it all comes crashing down 
 Tell me what's the difference between love and other drugs 
 Baby girl you're just as dangerous 
 You keep me falling, keep me falling 
 Like I'm free falling, got me feeling like I'm falling 
 (Keep me falling)
