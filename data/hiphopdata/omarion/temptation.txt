 Hi Papi 
 (Omarion) 
 Yeah 
 So what you trying to do? 
 Oh forreal? 
 Let me hit you right back then. 
 Now this girl at work she's on me really bad y'all 
 And the looks she gives my girl she be mad y'all 
 She has no shame in her game 
 She lets it be known that she wants me, she wants me 
 She gently touched my arm as she walks by 
 The girl is dope and I cannot lie 
 But it's not worth the pain or the shame 
 And it's sure not worth losing my baby 
 She's begging me come over, over 
 I'm tempted to drive over, over 
 If I do it's over, over 
 I got a girl at home 
 Temptations calling me 
 She's txting me come over, over 
 I'm tempted to walk over, over 
 But if I do it's over, over 
 I got a girl at home 
 Temptations calling me 
 Temptations (6x) 
 Her body kepps calling me (2x) 
 Now my momma used to warn me about these types of girls 
 How they break up happy homes and they do it well 
 And their style is to kiss and never tell 
 What goes around comes around 
 She whispers in my ear, oh no, oh no (3x) 
 She's telling me to come, come over 
 She's begging me come over, over 
 I'm tempted to drive over, over 
 If I do it's over, over 
 I got a girl at home 
 Temptations calling me 
 She's txting me come over, over 
 I'm tempted to walk over, over 
 But if I do it's over, over 
 I got a girl at home 
 Temptations calling me 
 Temptations (6x) 
 Her body kepps calling me (2x) 
 (Omarion) 
 Got my baby waiting at home so I can tap (laughs) 
 Aight I'm coming home to you baby 
 You know I love you, even though she bad 
 Even though I heard it's good, I'm all good 
 Yeah
