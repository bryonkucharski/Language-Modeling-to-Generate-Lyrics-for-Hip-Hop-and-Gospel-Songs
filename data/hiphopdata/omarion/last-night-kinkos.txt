You too fly to be workin' in 
 Workin' in, workin' in 
 You too fly to be workin' in 
 Work out, work out 
 Got me goin' back to Kinko's 
 Back to Kinko's, back to Kinko's 
 Just so you could throw me another free-throw 
 Free-throw, yeah 
 Last night, last night 
 When I put you on the copy machine 
 Body braided out, so nice, so nice 
 Yeah, mama can we do it the same? 
 Just like last night, last night 
 When I put you on the copy machine 
 Body braided out just right, just right 
 Ooh, mama can we do it the same? 
 Just like last night, last night 
 Just like last night 
 When I put you on the copy machine 
 This photo, you ain't never gotta work 
 Never gotta work, never gotta work 
 A little exposure never gonna hurt 
 Never gonna hurt you 
 You got me shootin' like a porno 
 Porno, porno 
 Bitch stick to me just like a bag of Frito's 
 Frito's, yeah 
 Last night, last night

 Body braided out, so nice, so nice

 Body braided out just right, just right 
 Ooh, mama can we do it the same?

 Body so fly, I just had to scan you 
 Put you on my hard drive, why? 
 'Cause last night, last night 
 When I put you on the copy machine 
 Body braided out, so nice, so nice 
 Yeah, mama can we do it the same? 
 Just like last night, last night 
 When I put you on the copy machine 
 Body braided out just right, just right 
 Ooh, mama can we do it the same? 
 Just like last night, last night 
 Just like last night 
 When I put you on the copy machine
