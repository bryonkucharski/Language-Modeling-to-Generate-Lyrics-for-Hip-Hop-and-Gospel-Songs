Maybach O, (Yeah) 
 Rozay,(I think I'ma pull up right here) 
 We gonna change your life overnight love, (What's up?) 
 Uh, big money (I'm back & shit) 
 Fast money, (Maybach O) 
 Believe that, (We going to turn out the club) 
 Lame ass niggas in your ear all night 
 Ciroc got me loose, but your dress fitting tight 
 My Rolly says two, but the time is three 
 Even though my watch wrong, girl, the time so right 
 I ain't selling no dreams, I ain't telling no lies 
 That dress so cold, but that body on fire 
 Ain't the smartest in the world, but looking at you girl 
 I'll be a fool to let the chance go by, so I'm gone 
 (Ask you what your interests are, who you be with?) 
 To convince you, I'm the one you should leave with 
 (Things to make you smile, what, what numbers to dial) 
 Girl, I got a thing for you, but it ain't no secret 
 If this conversation leads us 
 To the bed room we gon' make love 
 Cause girl I want to please you 
 And girl I really need you, so 
 Let's talk about you and me 
 Let's talk about tonight, baby 
 Let's talk about all the good things that could happen if you leave with me 
 You could see 'em hating if you want to 
 But he can't do your body like a player do, girl 
 (Who they attracting with that line, "What's your name? What's your sign?" 
 Soon as he buys that wine, I just creep up from behind) Let's talk 
 Look at them, ey-ey-eyes over here 
 Pop a few bottles like the first of the year 
 Stare so right, and the visual probably better 
 But I came over just to make things clear 
 No disrespect, girl, we both so grown 
 Just want you by my side when I say, "So long" 
 Been paying attention, niggas steady missing 
 Turning you off, let me turn you on, so I'm gone 
 (Ask you what your interests are, who you be with?) 
 To convince you, I'm the one you should leave with 
 (Things to make you smile, what, what numbers to dial)

 Uh, she lookin' like a bag of money 
 Like a boss, so you know I let her count it for me 
 Like to floss, new watch, gold rings 
 People next door swear I'm dealing cocaine 
 Me and O gettin' dough like it's no thing 
 New Maybachs, boy, that's way out of your range 
 All the chicks came like we at a Knicks game 
 Carmelo numbers first and the fifteenth 
 We the best in the biz', baby there it is 
 I'ma handle mine, little homie handle his 
 At the Portofino, I just bought the top floor 
 I'm living like Nino baby, and want more 
 Now double that, Rev Run bubble bath 
 Overlook the city, blowing out her back 
 She better blow my mind or she can holla back 
 I get better with time, and it's a fucking wrap 
 Let's talk about you and me
