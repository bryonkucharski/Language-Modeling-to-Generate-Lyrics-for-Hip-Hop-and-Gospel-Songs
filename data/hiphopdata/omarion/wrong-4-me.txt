Huh (x32) 
 She was on the way 
 I never saw her comin' 
 (Comin', come, come) 
 Everytime I figured out 
 It wasn't no use in runnin' 
 (Runnin', run, run) 
 I Thought that I was stronger 
 Couldn't be no wronger 
 Baby got me gone 
 Can't believe it 
 She... knew what she was doin' to me 
 She... had me in a coma for weeks 
 (I) 
 I can't sleep 'cause 
 (All) 
 All I think is she 
 (She) 
 She might be the one but... 
 Baby girl's wrong for me 
 I know it but she's giving it all to me 
 Can't let it go 
 This thing is takin' over me 
 Don't know what to do about this wrong 
 Can't leave her alone 'cause 
 (She did it) 
 She got me doin' things I would never 
 (She did it) 
 Someone I'm hooked to forever 
 She done broke 
 She done broke 
 She done broke me down, down 
 I know my baby's wrong 
 I love her but she's wrong for me 
 I'm really tryna find a way to get hold of it 
 (Hold, hold, hold) 
 It's getting' kinda crazy 
 Gotta get control of it 
 (Hold it, hold it, hold it) 
 I never been so caught up 
 Wasn't how I was brought up 
 It's gone on for too long 
 Ain't no way out 
 She... knew what she was doin' to me 
 (Doin' to me) 
 She... had me in a coma for weeks 
 (Weeks, I) 
 I can't sleep 'cause 
 (All) 
 All I think is 
 (She) 
 She might be the one but...

 Someone I'm hooked to forever 
 (Someone I'm hooked to forever)

 She done broke me down, down 
 (Broke me down, broke me down)
