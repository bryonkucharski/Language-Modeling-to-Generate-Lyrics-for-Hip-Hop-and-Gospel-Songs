Welcome to the Care Package 2 
 Sit back and enjoy... 
 Is it all in my head 
 More patron I done ran out 
 Used to be right here 
 She ain't out in my bed now 
 Now she up in this club 
 Walking 'round with her legs out 
 Showin' everybody love 
 Fucked around and got left out 
 Pour some for a minute 
 'Fore I knew it we finished 
 So they gave me time 
 Let me figure out 
 Then before I could we'd finished 
 Niggas all up on her 
 I'm actin' like I don't want her 
 Real nigga shit I'm dealing with 
 Can't accept that it's over 
 I still love her like she came with it 
 I still love her like she came with it 
 My money up 
 My bottles up 
 My whole section turnt up 
 Still it ain't enough 
 I still love her like she came with it 
 I still love her like she came with it 
 My money up 
 My bottles up 
 My whole section turnt up 
 Still it ain't enough 
 It was us, nigga 
 Pull up in the truck with her 
 She was fly, so was I 
 We was both killers 
 Bonny, Clyde, down to die 
 We was so trilla 
 Pour some for a minute 
 'Fore I knew it we finished 
 So they gave me time 
 Let me figure out 
 Then before I could we'd finished 
 Niggas all up on her 
 I'm actin' like I don't want her 
 Real nigga shit I'm dealing with 
 Can't accept that it's over 
 I still love her like she came with it 
 I still love her like she came with it 
 My money up 
 My bottles up 
 My whole section turnt up 
 Still it ain't enough 
 I still love her like she came with it 
 I still love her like she came with it 
 My money up 
 My bottles up 
 My whole section turnt up 
 Still it ain't enough
