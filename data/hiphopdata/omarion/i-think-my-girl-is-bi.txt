Yeah (young money!) 
 Back like I left somethin' 
 ??? 
 So I got this situation 
 My girl's been hangin' out With this other girl 
 Let me talk about it 
 Where is my girlfriend? 
 I been callin' 
 She ain't picked up 
 Somethings fishy 
 She won't hear me 
 Now I'm sittin' here 
 Like what the fuck? 
 This is too unusual 
 She never did it like this before 
 She usually calls me back within the hour 
 I bet she's out with what's her name 
 The girl that doesn't have a man 
 Assumptions in my mind got me confused girl 
 Sometimes you can't keep a pretty bitch off me 
 But when she's with her girlfriend she don't even speak 
 She could spot a pretty girl faster than I can 
 Tells me that she loves me but I'm tryna' understand 
 (3X) 
 I think my girl is... 
 Bi Ay Ay Ay Ay Ay Ay 
 Should I say goodbye? 
 Should I give it a try? 
 I think my girl is...
