"Puerto Rico" is where she come from 
 She asked me do I love her that recorded song 
 By si si si si bunoes bonita. 
 You wanna ever be mine stay on hip hop 
 But tonight where gonna reggaeton the whole club. 
 I see you party in the streets, 
 See my myself climbing in the 
 Seats the hood is like heaven now reminiscing 
 Them days when I thought about throwing on a towel 
 The night before the month was like Christmas 
 This kid keep hustling me sometimes I felt 
 Like I couldn't breath I would have to sit back 
 And play naive and it hurt watching my mum struggle 
 Trust me when you broke and hungry it's hard 
 To stay out of trouble it's a survival of the fittest 
 Whatever it took to bring money to the table 
 I did it even my girl lost faith in me 
 Left me out trapped in this negative energy 
 Listening deeply but I have to keep on 
 Moving I refuse to let this darkness, cath up to me 
 "Puerto Rico" is where she come from 
 She asked me do I love her that recorded song 
 By si si si bunoes bonita. 
 You wanna ever be mine stay on hip hop 
 But tonight where gonna reggaton the whole club. 
 Dowled up but it was just a distraction 
 Even the streets never gave us a little time to relax 
 Writing my rhymes to a vibe scap in the corner 
 Wrapped me like a cake I'm trying to be this super man 
 In the ghetto get this paper take this music 
 To a whole new level trouble found me now 
 I found myself in Puerto Rico spy got hot 
 I had to roll living with my paps 
 I really don't no missing my lady try not to tell it show 
 Her new man telling her I would probably never blow 
 Wanted to tell to the flow I know robbin' it stay in the zone 
 And move hard or go home open my eyes now 
 I see myself on the rock miens bonitas 
 Everywhere I wanna ride 
 "Puerto Rico" is where she come from 
 She asked me do I love her that recorded song 
 By si si si bunoes bonita. 
 You wanna ever be mine stay on hip hop 
 But tonight where gonna reggaton the whole club. 
 All you gotta do is listen 
 Banno yellow telia mama (yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 Seie tiel mama bata 
 Bitu weil teia sicla 
 Como elese wella 
 Si pak pak wella 
 I never thought I would see the day 
 That I will be getting money making music 
 So these hatters wouldn't take nothing off me 
 When the chicks wouldn't holla I just 
 Play them back all I had was a flow and a ball 
 Cap, watch right across the room 
 Thinking they will be dancing to me soon so 
 I'm in the game selling the streets though rapped 
 So hard that I'm in Puerto Rico Puerto Rico 
 "Puerto Rico" is where she come from 
 She asked me do I love her that recorded song 
 By si si si bunoes bonita. 
 You wanna ever be mine stay on hip hop 
 But tonight where gonna reggaeton the whole club. 
 All you gotta do is listen 
 She looks fine just whistle at her 
 See the cops coming then just miss at her 
 If I can't spend my weekend in a cell century 
 Reggaeton, reaggaeton, reggaeton (carnival style)
