From the moment you came in 
 You knew I been watching 
 Been picturing you out of 
 Them clothes that you wearing 
 Get naked 
 Girl can you blame me? 
 When your hair long and your ass fat 
 And you know how much I like that 
 Heels high and that dress tight 
 And I'm wondering why you wore that 
 To tease me 
 Can't be no other reason 
 And there's so many girls in here tonight 
 So many girls in here that's so so fine 
 But Shawty I can't lie 
 Out of all of these girls in this club 
 You're the only one that I wanna 
 You're the only one that I wanna fuck, baby 
 Out of all of these girls on this floor 
 You're the only one that I wanna 
 You're the only one I wanna take home, baby 
 Gone get your drink and them drinks on me don't trip 
 I'm lost In the moment you got a nigga horny 
 I promise (soon as we get back to the crib tho) 
 I'm a put it on you 
 I wanna be covered in your lip stick 
 And wearing your fragrance 
 Whatever the name is 
 I don't really care put it on me 
 You know you want me, yeah 
 And there's so many girls in here tonight 
 So many girls in here that's so so fine 
 But Shawty I can't lie 
 Out of all of these girls in this club 
 You're the only one that I wanna 
 You're the only one that I wanna Fuck, baby 
 Out of all of these girls on this floor 
 You're the only one that I wanna 
 You're the only one I wanna take home, baby 
 Holla at me shawty right before you know you leaving 
 I'm here for the night 
 I'm staying at the four seasons 
 If you wanna roll, if you wanna roll 
 Shawty you can go, Shawty you can go 
 Shawty you can go, Shawty you can go 
 Out of all of these girls in this club 
 You're the only one that I wanna 
 You're the only one that I wanna fuck, baby 
 Out of all of these girls on this floor 
 You're the only one that I wanna 
 You're the only one I wanna take home, baby
