See you Saturday in toxic 
 But you ain't nothin' like them girls that you came with 
 No eye contact done locked in 
 Then I put you in my phone as my main chick 
 I can tell by the way 
 You the type to cook a nigga meal by the way 
 You the type to pay a nigga bill by the way 
 Twerk it like you're doing it for real by the way

 Sun goes down, watch her turn in to a freak 
 Hundred bad bitches, all I see 
 Is you, you you you you you 
 Keep it spontaneous, we're breaking all the rules 'cause I can, yeah 
 When you on top you know a nigga can't have her understand, no 
 When you get tempted while you're looking I'm looking for a freak, yeah 
 We can keep it deadly yeah you know I'm talking seven days a week, yeah
