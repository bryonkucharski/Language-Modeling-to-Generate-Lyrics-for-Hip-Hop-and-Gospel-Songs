They lookin' at you, standing next to me 
 The closest to perfection, some might ever see 
 Girl they know, to look this good it probably took some time 
 So all these bottles won't stop coming even when they close this bar tonight 
 That you ain't gotta ever leave 
 'Cause baby you here with me 
 You ain't gotta ever go 
 You can tell 'em if they wanna know 
 That if anybody wanna know 
 You with a boss mah'fucker 
 You with a boss mah'fucker 
 You with a boss mah'fucker 
 You can tell 'em if they wanna know 
 If they ask you can let it go 
 Tell 'em I'm a boss mah'fucker 
 Ever seen a presidential suite before? 
 So come on in, in the mornin' 
 I be John and you be Marilyn Monroe 
 It's the way I see ya baby girl your legendary beautiful 
 And as long as you're around me baby girl than everyone else will know 
 That you ain't gotta ever leave 
 'Cause baby you here with me 
 You ain't gotta ever go 
 You can tell 'em if they wanna know 
 That if anybody wanna know 
 When you with me you know you fuckin' with a boss 
 You ain't gotta leave when you're fuckin' with a boss 
 Everything free when you fuckin' with a boss 
 When you with me you know you fuckin' with a boss 
 I'm a boss mah'fucker 
 Flown with a bad one, time for some action 
 Safe combination, keys to the mansion 
 Still a hodd nigga, flight reservations 
 Blowin' out your candles, fat boy straight cakin' 
 She deserve a real one 
 Now you fuckin' with a real one 
 Walk with a real one 
 This a whole 'nother feelin' 
 Then we fuck like we both mad 
 Better than we ever both had 
 She can see through my soul 
 Know when I'm creepin' with these hoes 
 Forgiatos on the 'vette 
 First and last name on the check 
 48 laws of power 
 Shawty, the world is ours 
 You with a boss mah'fucker 
 You with a boss mah'fucker 
 You with a boss mah'fucker 
 You can tell 'em if they wanna know 
 If they ask you can let it go 
 Tell 'em I'm a boss mah'fucker
