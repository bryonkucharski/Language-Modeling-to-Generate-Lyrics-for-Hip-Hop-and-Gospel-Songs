Man, I'm fresh as hell in this hoodie 
 Uh, yeah, uh, uh, let's get it 
 Oh, Omarion, yeah, uh, yeah 
 With my hoodie on 
 With my hoodie on 
 With my hoodie on 
 See the money, see the cars, see the house, livin' large 
 Look in the mirror, see a star, I'm outta space, hella far 
 They at the bottom, I'm on top, I'm so high, I can't drop 
 And you can find me in your city steezed out with my hoodie 
 I go, I go, I go so hard 
 I got my 501 jeans on with my hoodie on 
 All white V-Neck clean with my hoodie on 
 Fresh out the box so boast with my hoodie on 
 I drop my steez on with my hoodie on 
 I'm gettin' money all day, every day with my hoodie on 
 Baby, lookin' good over there with the hoodie on 
 Hustlers, gangstas, bustas, ridas 
 They goin' out with they hoodie on 
 You see the fade bright lights 
 You see my chick, you see my eyes 
 I hit the stage, I kill the mic 
 Get em' on the floor, we gettin' right 
 Nigga, I'm a vet, give it up 
 I get respect, Cali love 
 And you can find me in your city 
 Steezed out with my hoodie 
 I go, I go, I go so hard 
 I got my 501 jeans on with my hoodie on 
 All white V-Neck clean with my hoodie on 
 Fresh out the box so boast with my hoodie on 
 I drop my steez on with my hoodie on 
 I'm gettin' money all day, every day with my hoodie on 
 Baby, lookin' good over there with the hoodie on 
 Hustlers, gangstas, bustas, ridas 
 They goin' out with they hoodie on 
 I get money all day, every day with my hoodie on 
 Strong on the rap game, know I get my bully on 
 And I stay strapped, boy, you know I keep my fully on 
 Hustle like I'm broke even though a nigga fully on 
 Aw, y'all be doin' too much, this is 2010 
 We don't do button ups, this incredible fashion 
 This incredible fabric, got my Levi's saggin' 
 Got my L Coat draggin' 
 Aw, comin' down on you hoes 
 Comin' down like I'm Hova 
 I had to rock on the stove 
 I smoke a rock when I roll 
 You know that presidential, pass it to O 
 He like, "Oh no, I'm high off life my nigga" 
 I'm like, "All right, my nigga" 
 I guess that's more for me, chronic with no seeds 
 Like no ovaries, you dig it 
 But if you don't then who cares? 
 I got my hood on my arm and hoodie over my head 
 I got my 501 jeans on with my hoodie on 
 All white V-Neck clean with my hoodie on 
 Fresh out the box so boast with my hoodie on 
 I drop my steez on with my hoodie on 
 I'm gettin' money all day, every day with my hoodie on 
 Baby, lookin' good over there with the hoodie on 
 Hustlers, gangstas, bustas, ridas 
 They goin' out with they hoodie on 
 Man, I hope they don't think I'ma rob em' with this hoodie on
