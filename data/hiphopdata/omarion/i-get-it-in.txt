I done cut the braids, low cut, got my grown on 
 Had a sister label, Young Money, Money, long, long 
 I be so L.A. got my Chucks and my Locs on 
 I was in MIA, and MIA Superman on 
 I know I got it, I know she on it 
 I know you see it, I know she want it 
 She got that Cali good and she kinda hood 
 She got me policin' and wishin' that a nigga would 
 This lil' mama got her back right 
 She be skatin' on it, got a nigga singin' flashlight 
 They be trying to get her, but she be holdin' on hella tight 
 I got to act right, that's what she like 
 I get it in, I get it in 
 I get it in, I get up in the game 
 I get it in, I get it in 
 I get it in, I get up in the thing 
 Get it 
 Done with them boys, 'cause she done found a man now 
 Ain't no competition, she fumble when it hangs down 
 I'mma show her love, love, even when when my fans 'round 
 Get into the music baby, tell me how my bass sound 
 I know I got it, I know she on it 
 I know you see it, I know she want it 
 She got that Cali good and she kinda hood 
 She got me policin' and wishin' that a nigga would 
 This lil' mama got her back right 
 She be skatin' on it, got a nigga singin' flashlight 
 They be trying to get her, but she be holdin' on hella tight 
 I got to act right, that's what she like 
 I get it in, I get it in 
 I get it in, I get up in the game 
 I get it in, I get it in 
 I get it in, I get up in the thing 
 Get it 
 Fresh out my Bugatti, Polo on my body 
 I'm jumpin' in this shit like a pogo on a potty 
 So she come and talk to me like K-Ci, JoJo, and Devante 
 I say, "Hi, my name is Weezy and I know you know Omarion" 
 I get it in like parking spots 
 And they say money talks so don't ask me why I talk a lot 
 Girl, I'll kiss your softest spot, I'll buy your apartment out 
 Actually I just bought a house, I get it in then walk them out 
 I done got them dreads braided up, hair long, long 
 And I'm with a red don, that don't want to leave her thong on 
 It's too big, it's too wide, it won't fit but 
 I get it in, I get it in 
 I get it in, I get up in the game 
 I get it in, I get it in 
 I get it in, I get up in the thing 
 Get it
