Million dollar deals I'm involved in 
 Girls come and go them doors is revolving 
 Baby, you fine like the wine in my cellar

 You know, you know, you know, you know 
 This is how we get it on 
 Bet I can read your mind

 All of that bullshit, that he put in your mind 
 This is a lot of work, meet me in the middle 
 Make it worth it baby, you know I'm so official 
 Don't be dealin' with them scrubs tonight (tonight, tonight) 
 Get with a boss, you need a thug in your life (yo life, yo life) 
 Real winners gon' throw the cash on yo ass 
 I would like to put my autograph on yo ass 
 Go deep till you feel it 
 Every night I'mma kill it 
 And cut it, no scissors 
 Get familiar with the realest (ah) 
 Them planes be charted, I'm all over the web and I ain't Peter Parker 
 Motion pictures, something to move ya body on 
 The soundtrack be provided by Omarion

 If she ain't Miss America then she her relative 
 She kill 'em everyday 
 Hatin' hoes, sheddin' tears 
 And that new Ferrari automatically switch gears 
 Why sell, endorse her 
 Let her tell it

 You wit the money team, we live in another world 
 Ayye ayye, Ayye ayye 
 We just got inside and now that shit is jumpin' like
