 In the beginning we were supposed to be temporary 
 But you put that thang on me. 
 They tryna explain to me 
 That I should just let it be 
 'Cause I'm lookin' crazy. 
 But I can't be concerned with that. 
 I'm tryna get it again. 
 Said I'm not that hard. 
 You pull my card 
 Girl I'm tryna kick the habit, 
 I'm an addict. 
 I can't let you go, 
 Even though I know 
 That you're not worth me, and ain't good for me 
 I just can't let you go. 
 You got a man buy you all up on me. 
 And I know I should let it go, 
 You knockin' at my door 
 And put the pain (thang?) on me. 
 And you're talkin' to your homies. 
 I ain't concerned with that, 
 I'm tryna get it again. 
 I'm not that hard. 
 You pull my card 
 Girl I'm tryna kick the habit, 
 I'm an addict. 
 I can't let you go, 
 Even though I know 
 That you're not worth me, and ain't good for me 
 I just can't let you go. 
 Let it go. 
 Yeah 
 Ho! 
 (Just can't let you go) 
 Yeah! 
 Whoo! 
 Omarion! 
 I'm not that hard. (oh yeah!) 
 You pull my card 
 Girl I'm tryna kick the habit, 
 I'm an addict. (Just can't stop it baby) 
 I can't let you go, (yeah) 
 Even though I know (I know) 
 That you're not worth me, and ain't good for me 
 I just can't let you go. (for me, for me, oh baby) 
 Uh 
 Just can't let you go... 
 (Breathing) 
 Ah!
