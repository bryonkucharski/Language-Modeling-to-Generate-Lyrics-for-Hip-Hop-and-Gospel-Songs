Uh ... yeah ... ah ... one of those thuggin' ... Kind of thangs ... T.U.G ... 
 Listen (Fienin You) 
 (Verse One) 
 I've been noticing you been going in and out when you feel the need baby 
 But I can't help but to wonder where ... where you areeee (awwhh no) 
 See I've done my dirt, chasing all them skirts all around the world I've done my do. 
 But when it comes to you I will loose my head, but it's hard to sleep alone 
 And I know when I'm away 
 You miss me all day 
 But driving me crazy girl I'm fiening you 
 But you leave me all alone 
 I'll be back 4sho 
 Just so that you know girl I'm fiening you 
 When you need to be relaxed lay down on your back 
 Know who you can ask 'cause I'm fiening you 
 Baby know all threw the day you keep me in my place 
 One thought of your face and I fiening you 
 (Verse Two) 
 When you're not around, baby girl I'm down and out 'cause I'm thinking about you (whoa) 
 (Are you creeping on me?) Baby just let me know 
 Who it is, What it is Right now 
 Fo it get real ugly 
 This situation bugs me 
 Tell me if you love me 
 Or if this means nothing (whoa) or wen I'm away 
 And I know when I'm away 
 You miss me all day 
 But driving me crazy girl I'm fiening you 
 But you leave me all alone 
 I'll be back 4sho 
 Just so that you know girl I'm fiening you 
 When you need to be relaxed lay down on your back 
 Know who you can ask 'cause I'm fiening you 
 Baby know all threw the day you keep me in my place 
 One thought of your face and I fiening you
