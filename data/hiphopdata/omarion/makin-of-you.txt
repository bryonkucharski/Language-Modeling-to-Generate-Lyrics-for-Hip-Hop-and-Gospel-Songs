Hey 
 I Wanna Talk To You 
 Now Woman, I know you don't know ways feel appreciated us, man 
 But we do appreciate you, you know, we may not say it to show it all the time, but this is one of those songs, that you should turn up loud, listen. 
 Sometimes I take advantage of 
 Always, having you here with me 
 But don't think for a second love 
 That I, Don't see how much, how much you do for me 
 From the way you kiss me every morning to just being there when I need you up here 
 And all I can say to you 
 Tut-tut-ut-tut [x6] 
 You can't always depend on love, no, no-no-no 
 It means more than that for our relation ship - to work 
 That's when you come in, you make all this work by understand me 
 Girl you don't have to say you love me, 'cause you show it everyday just what I need to you, to do 
 Tut-tut-ut-tut [x9]
