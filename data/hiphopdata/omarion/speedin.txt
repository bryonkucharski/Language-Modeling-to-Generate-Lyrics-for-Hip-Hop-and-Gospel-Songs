When I looked over my shoulder 
 It got a little bit colder 
 It's like I lost love from an angel 
 And now I'm feelin' like a stranger 
 Abandoned, I'm stranded 
 I gotta get back to you 
 I called AAA, they said they on the way 
 Times tickin' fast, gotta see you today 
 But if my time is up 
 Let me know right now 
 I will find a way 
 To your heart again 
 So I'm speedin' 
 I'm speedin', whoa 
 Speedin' 
 I'm speedin' 
 Alright, no time to be patient 
 Just got the confirmation 
 And now I'm flyin' down the highway 
 She's cryin', tryin' to love my way 
 I'm with it, so with it 
 Committed to ride away with you girl 
 And give you what you need 
 More than your eyes could ever see 
 But if my time is up 
 Let me know right now 
 I will find a way 
 To your heart again 
 So I'm speedin' 
 I'm speedin', whoa 
 Speedin' 
 I'm speedin' 
 Time's movin' fast but not fast enough 
 So we're speedin', speedin' 
 I'm racin' fast but not fast enough 
 So I'm speedin', speedin' 
 I'm doin' 90 down the highway 
 Gotta make this turn, I'll be there right away, baby 
 Hop out the car, I'm at your door, open it up and there you go 
 I gotta scoop you in my arms 
 But if my time is up 
 Let me know right now 
 I will find a way 
 To your heart again 
 So I'm speedin' 
 I'm speedin', whoa 
 Speedin' 
 I'm speedin' 
 Speedin', I'm speedin' 
 Oh, speedin', I'm speedin' 
 Speedin', I'm speedin' 
 Speedin'
