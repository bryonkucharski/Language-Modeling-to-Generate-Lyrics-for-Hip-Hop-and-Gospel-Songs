 Hello I'm paradise 
 Mr. Martian, sex on a satellite 
 What'cha know 'bout good weed and Gladis Knight 
 You won't wanna stop, no brakes, no hazard light 
 I satisfy, very accurately 
 I work in the satisfactory, the factory 
 How 'bout a dance and a Daiquiri 
 Then I gotta pin to the bed like we wrestling 
 I'm Weezy F baby boy 
 Comfortable like a lazy boy 
 And shawty soundin' like a tazer-boy 
 Make me drop to my knees and praise da' boy 
 I got the music on mellow 
 Champagne, hello 
 Make me wake up to make up on the pillow 
 I'm her TV, I'm her Weezy and all 
 (Omarion) 
 Oh, comfort, your, comfort, your 
 I will be your comfort, comfort, your, comfort, 
 Your, comfort, comfort, comfort, comfort, comfort 
 You can call me 
 You can call me 
 (Lil Wayne) 
 See I'm the rapper, and he's the dancer 
 And together we are 
 Your comfort
