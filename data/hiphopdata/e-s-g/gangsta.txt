(Feat. Jae Millz) 
 Talking: 
 You already know what it is, from Harlem to Houston 
 Jae Millz, E.S.G. holla at me my nigga 
 Cause you say you sold drugs, that don't make you a gangsta 
 Fighting in the club, that don't make you a gangsta 
 You say you been to jail, that don't make you a gangsta 
 Better listen to me man, that's his marketing plan 
 Cause you dropped out of school, that don't make you a gangsta 
 O.G.'ing tattoos, that don't make you a gangsta 
 These boys got you fooled, no they ain't gangstas 
 Better listen to me man, that's his marketing plan 
 E.S.G.: 
 Now these cats get on TV, like they animals homes 
 Throw on a white T, four or five bandanas on 
 Tony Montana in they songs, living like John Gotti 
 But you check they background, they never shot nobody 
 They claim they from the trap, like T.I. or Jeezy 
 Claim to be a O.G., like Snoop Dogg or Eazy 
 Knowing you went to Cali, won't say no names 
 Had a pretty red fitted hat, he thought it was Game 
 Drove up the wrong street, looking for Mary Jane 
 Got popped close range, I guess he thought it was a game 
 Most gangstas in the Pen, the judge won't spare ya 
 Like Malcolm X, Mandela, Shae Gavera 
 Yeah my squad like Terror, aka a terror squad 
 Catch me sipping Remy Ma, in the back prison yard 
 Yep I had a murder charge, spent half my life on probation 
 I ain't saying do the same, homie get your education 
 Better keep your credit straight, and your mind on your mail 
 Live your life like mine, you might end up in jail yeah 
 E.S.G.: 
 Pac and B.I.G., no we ain't forgot them 
 Cops ain't arrested, no one who shot them 
 Mo' money mo' problems, suppose to get better 
 Feel for Afeni, like I feel for Violetta 
 Jae Millz: 
 Ay yo they call me Jae Millz, Tru Lenox and Banger 
 These niggaz talking crazy, but I know they ain't gangstas 
 Not even, but you lames won't be satisfied 
 Till you not breathing, something a box sleeping 
 Yeah where I'm from, they shooting out all weekend 
 It's Uptown nigga, lay your ass down nigga 
 Across the 'Stead, shooting them canons and spit crazy 
 Try to play me and I'm taking thirty shots, like I'm a great 
 I'm from the Apple, but I'm heavy from the H 
 To the H, that's Harlem to Houston more probs no solution 
 So what, you just came home off a bid 
 I heard you snitched it's worse, now you gotta switch that ain't gangsta 
 E.S.G.: 
 For nearly three summers, I was known by a number 
 That's why I'm banging like Jennis, when I'm riding in my Hummer 
 Will I live another year, the streets keep asking me 
 Will I wind up locked down, like Pimp C or Cassidy 
 Trying to avoid a tragedy, and stack this money 
 Is the industry ready, for a down South Tsunami 
 The new heir to the throne, the new Screw music king 
 Boys call me Bob Johnson, I control the team 
 Like I'm Pretty Boy Floyd, I control the ring 
 Two time convicted felon, use to control the fiends 
 I refuse to let a label, control my dream 
 Refuse to talk about just, cars and bling-bling 
 Y'all repeating the same thing, we can't have that 
 How many people you cats, plan to kill in your raps 
 Cause the ice and Maybach, your label rented that 
 When the video is over, you gotta give it back 
 Said the ice and Maybach, your label rented that 
 When the video is over, you gotta give it back g'eah
