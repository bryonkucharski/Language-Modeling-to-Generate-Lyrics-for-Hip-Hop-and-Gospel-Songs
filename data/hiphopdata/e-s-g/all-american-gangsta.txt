(*Talking*) 
 Say, say yeah-yeah, come here for a minute 
 (Listen to me everybody), huh it's a true story people 
 (I got a story to tell), about a G-A-N-G-S-T-A 
 (E.S.G.) 
 Gangsta, never heard the word befo' 
 Think the first time, I was like nine years old 
 All my life been told, don't you curse or steal 
 Do onto others as they do onto you, be for real 
 Saw my first drug deal, while in the 8th grade 
 So this the way, a lot of po' folks be getting paid 
 I wasn't raised that way, I'm making A's and B's 
 But I'm sick and tired, of having empty ass Christmas trees 
 Wasn't no mongoose for me, or sued Pumas for the Boss 
 Couldn't get no bike, cause my mama laid off 
 Santa Clause ain't coming, ain't chimneys in the projects 
 Just smoked out vents, begging for a long check 
 Hanging on the wrong set, eating cookies and chips 
 While other cats on the track, had cookies to flip 
 Exposed me to a new way, to get me some pay 
 Day by day, I'm turning to a 
 (All American gangsta), all my life I wanted to be 
 A real (gangsta), not the kind on TV 
 I mean a (gangsta), and I ain't talking bout prankstas 
 (A gangsta), talking bout that (all American gangsta) 
 That's the only life I know 
 I mean a (gangsta), all about his cash flow 
 I mean a (gangsta), one that just won't quit 
 A real (gangsta), talking bout (that all American gangsta) 
 (E.S.G.) 
 Coming home, from practice 
 Throw my jersey in the washer, grab my work from under my mattress 
 Be on the block, 5 to 9 going bout 10 
 The next day I wake up, same thang again 
 True sporting letterman, football or hoops 
 Ain't no telling what you'll find, stuffed in my Polo boots 
 All-city athlete, two T.D's a game 
 Hop off the bus hit the cuts, three OZ's of caine 
 See a year came, all-state putting it down 
 20 points 10 rebounds, scoring six pounds 
 College scouts came down, even a few from the pro's 
 But little do they know, I'm a 
 (All American gangsta), all my life I wanted to be 
 A real (gangsta), not the kind on TV 
 I mean a (gangsta), not no studio pranksta 
 But a (gangsta), talking bout (that all American gangsta) 
 One that, just won't snitch 
 I mean a (gangsta), keep it real with his click 
 A real (gangsta), who be putting it down 
 A real (gangsta), till they put me six feet underground 
 (*Talking*) 
 I'm a gangsta, know I'm saying 
 But I ain't finished yet, come here (listen to me everybody) 
 Ha true story, (I got a story to tell) 
 About a G-A-N-G-sta 
 (E.S.G.) 
 I got some scars to prove, I refuse to lose 
 You gotta pay some dues, wanna fill my shoes 
 Now which road should I choose, a gangsta or a jock 
 Which team should I choose, the field or the block 
 It's a good day, feel like grinding today 
 Cause tomorrow, gon be national signing day 
 Who should I choose, Florida State or LSU 
 Mean while this cat roll, I'm talking bout (hey you) 
 I'm like who me (yeah you, is your name Cedric Hill 
 You've been charged with conspiracy, to make a drug deal) 
 Be real, two and a half years being locked away 
 Now I'm a ex-convict, can't get a job today 
 Instead of signing with the pros, and going big time 
 I spent my day locked away, and signing for my time 
 Let me put this on your mind, America thank ya 
 You're the reason, I turned into the 
 (*Talking*) 
 G'd up for real nigga, I don't care where you from 
 East Coast, West Coast, Midwest, Dirty South 
 Game recognize game, real G's click for real G's baby 
 Blue wear blue, red wear red you're Vice Lord or G.D. 
 We don't give a damn, long as you bout your money 
 E.S.G., SES (all American gangsta)
