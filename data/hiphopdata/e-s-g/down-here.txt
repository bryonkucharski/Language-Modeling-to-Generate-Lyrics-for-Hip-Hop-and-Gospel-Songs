(*Scarface*) 
 I want y'all to bust some shit man 
 And tell these niggaz man, that y'all invented 
 That motherfucking for, every motherfucking body 
 And they mama, trying to bust man 
 (Ha-ha, really though), you know I'm saying man 
 Niggaz out here man, steal y'all shit on chrome 
 Ass wanna be E.S.G., kinky ass niggaz man 
 Bring they hat to they motherfucking ass man 
 Let these hoes know how we do it down here 
 (Down here), ha we like to roll on dubs 
 (Down here), we keep a chicken head up in the club 
 (Down here), my thugs they get nothing but love 
 (Down here), we off the chain like you thought we was 
 (Slim Thug) 
 I'm from the city of sippers, wood grain wheel grippers 
 Kilo shippers, candy coat car flippers 
 We ride 4's and vogues, with a mouth full of golds 
 Country niggaz and hoes, down here is how we roll 
 When something's tight it's thoed, when we shine we hold 
 You got cash cars and clothes, you balling out of control 
 Switching lanes on swinging thangs, that's called swang and bang 
 The club packed from front to back, that club off the chain 
 You got candy rims and beat, then you got you a slab 
 You cooking chickens in the kitchen, boy you off in the lab 
 Boys that hustle they grind, and if your diamonds shine you blind 
 You making money looking good, then you showing your behind 
 You blow endo that's do-do, screwed up means slow mo 
 You ride big body Benz, you riding big body fo' do' 
 Fa sho though you know, how that Texas talk 
 I'm trying to stack my green, I mean fill up my vault 
 (E.S.G) 
 Down here playboy, the gumbo's hot and spicy 
 Twinkies twist and crawfish, my wrist all icy 
 Better watch your wifey, down here we off the hook 
 You was smart that, better back-back take a look 
 I'm from the city where crooks, wear Cardiers and Rolleys 
 In Texas we partnas, in Louisiana they whodies 
 But it's the same thing, on this side of the Mississippi 
 Two hundred dollas a bottle, ain't talking bout Crissy 
 Talking bout codeine, baby fill up my cup 
 2002 Escalade, Billy grill on my truck 
 Now hold up maan, top down in the Bentley 
 With a bad chick, in my tape Monica Lewinsky 
 Made a mill independent, can't touch me kids 
 Split your wig then hire Cochran, like Puffy did 
 (Fiesta) fiesta, like my name R. Kelly 
 I'm the boss see the cross, hanging off of our bellys 
 (Lil' Keke) 
 I can tell that you boys, got the wrong idea 
 We some slab riding gangstas, get a car every year 
 (Down here) we like to ball, play above the rim 
 E.S.G., the young Don and a thug named Slim 
 (Down here), we tolerate no type of disrespect 
 Have a bitch acting bad, on that do' and that X 
 (Down here), we push 26 sitting low to the flo' 
 And double deuces on a truck, when I crawl by slow 
 (This year), I'm gonna switch it to the platinum frame 
 Do shows with plenty hoes, that be screaming my name 
 (Down here), it ain't no telling when you talking 'bout us 
 Got rocks in both ears, cause that shit is a must 
 (Down here), we break hearts and leave punks for dead 
 We don't claim the blue or red, cause our city is FED 
 (Down here), I'm better known as Lil' Keke the Don 
 Getting rich and going hard, to get it all for my son
