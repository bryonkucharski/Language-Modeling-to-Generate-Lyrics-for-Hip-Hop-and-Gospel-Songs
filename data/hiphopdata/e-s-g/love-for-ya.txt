E.S.G. huh, Lil' Keke the don 
 Ha ha, it's long overdue baby 
 Huh, been waiting for the Southside 
 That swanging and banging to put it down, what? 
 Mr. Slim Thug, huh 
 Northside, Southside let's do this homie 
 Ha ha, C.M.G. Boss Hogg Outlaws 
 We platinum in the ghetto, tell 'em Ke 
 H-Town superstars gotta walk that walk 
 Popped up on twenty twos, will make you squash that talk 
 In Texas a living legend, it just ain't my fault 
 If I see it and I want it, I just go to the vault 
 We some city slickers 
 But these niggaz out of state think we some shit kickers 
 You bring your nuts up on your guns and just try to get us 
 But I ain't gon' lie you fucking with some real mob figgas 
 I'm talking hard hitters 
 We out here stunting, while most of you niggaz faking and fronting 
 Slim Thug and E.S.G. and Lil' Ke, we pay for hunting 
 It's a hell of a ride, hell of a role, hell of a stroll 
 We ship it gold so the paper can fold 
 Have you ever met some thugs that can ride like us? 
 Cutting corners burning blocks, looking fly as us 
 Endo, hydro, getting high as us 
 With a bad little broad on the side of us 
 'Cause we bouncing, bouncing, rolling up the strip 
 Twenty inches when I flip, looking good when I dip 
 And we be riding, sliding, doing what we do 
 Northside, Southside, we got love for you 
 Now hol' up hol' up, E.S.G. hit the do' 
 Say, "Ke, we ain't cooking thirty six no mo'" 
 I whipped eighty baby, I'm in the game forever 
 Represent it sold a million independent together 
 I'm with the Young Don, Boss Hoggs in the do' 
 Working with a quarter mill, smelling like hydro 
 Look at the grill hoe, I spent sixty on ice 
 I'm at the Source Awards looking like a disco light 
 Purple Sprite push white, FED's starting to get curious 
 Act a fool like Ja Rule, move fast and furious 
 What you get when you mix two of the Screwed Up Click 
 With the Boss of the north standing 'bout six six 
 Now this is it, watch me spit sixteen from the heart 
 R.I.P. to DJ Screw, you was there from the start 
 Now on your mark get ready, playa roll up a ounce 
 'Cause when the hook come in, drop your top gon bounce, huh 
 Have you ever met some thugs that can ride like us? 
 Cutting corners burning blocks, looking fly as us 
 Endo, hydro, getting high as us 
 With a bad little broad on the side of us 
 'Cause we bouncing, bouncing, rolling up the strip 
 Twenty inches when I flip, looking good when I dip 
 And we be riding, sliding, doing what we do 
 Northside, Southside, we got love for you 
 It's H-Town dream team, ball more than a king 
 I guess it's in my bloodstream to be about my green 
 A new face on the scene, I'm the rap game rookie 
 Trying to do some new, I'm tired of cooking up cookies 
 We getting paid down here, living laid down here 
 Hit the club with bald fades and braids down here 
 Slim E and Ke, we Texas best 
 We three hard young G's, that don't settle for less 
 You can't mess with the Tex, Boss Hogg on top 
 When I park at the club, my rims don't stop 
 They keep cutting, ten G's for these with the buttons 
 In the DTS strutting, I ain't want for nothing 
 From the bottom to the top and I can't fail 
 I'm in a click about they mail, I know you can tell 
 We living swell 'cause we got a lot of thangs to sell 
 I know the FED's on my trail but I'm giving 'em hell 
 Have you ever met some thugs that can ride like us? 
 Cutting corners, burning blocks, looking fly as us 
 Endo, hydro, getting high as us 
 With a bad little broad on the side of us 
 'Cause we bouncing, bouncing, rolling up the strip 
 Twenty inches when I flip, looking good when I dip 
 And we be riding, sliding, doing what we do 
 Northside, Southside, we got love for you
