I'm the product of illegals 
 I'm one hundred like C notes 
 And I'm with all my girls and we are stuntin' like Kenevil 
 Ima movie with a sequel 
 I wear shades to see no evil 
 Ima shark up in this shit 
 And you just a bitch, beagle 
 Look, Ima bomb y'all bitches 
 Like the Zom-b-gone with me 
 And I never wanna hear another fuckin' word 
 Ima bon y'all chicks 
 And Ima ball that shit 
 I'm undespicable, syllables that I've heard 
 Ima raw raw chick, you a knock off bitch 
 Imma pop off with my folk, we word 
 Thank god I've been on some mall paul spit 
 'Cause I can't think what it's like to be heard 
 Yeah yeah its tha product, on my way to the top bra 
 They tell me to be patient but I'm Russian like Oksana 
 Ima double shot of patrone and you're a pina-colada 
 Ima whole lotta something, you a whole lotta nada 
 Look any chick that's thinking she'll be stopping mes crazy 
 That's why I got em' cryin' like colic-y babies 
 If you thinking ill quit, then I'm sorry keep waiting 
 I'm a dollar not a dime and you're a penny (jacey) 
 You gunna need a tokina lens 
 Too capture my shit 'cause I'm goin' again 
 Get a little bud 'cause I'm smokin' again 
 If you're broke then I get why you don't like my shit 
 Its ok I get woke by my friends 
 Oh you thought you was hot well its snowin' again 
 Flows so cold I don't open the fridge 
 Snow got flow its ok don't pretend 
 Tight rhyme horder, all these years I been collectin' 
 Got em' with their eyes like quarters 
 I'm changing their perspective 
 I make times much warmer, save on your electric 
 I'm the hottest thing walking and the dopest thing wrecking 
 Look, time is money honey I only race with the seconds 
 So I don't compete with bitches I just kill em' then collect em' 
 We the shit homegirl, Watch where you steppin' 
 Only time I seen a hotter chick that bitch was my reflection 
 Look, every single verse that I put out gets a repeat 
 Every single thing I ever mention gets a retweet 
 S-s-starvin on your end, we buffetin' like CiCi's 
 And I'm running bitches over they don't even get a beep beep 
 Move!
