Girl you wild (Uh, uh) 
 And you foul (Uh, uh) 
 You tripping now? (Uh, uh) 
 You tricked out (Uh, uh) 
 You going down (Uh, uh) 
 The fake in town (Uh, uh) 
 That's what I heard and see I can't tell you how 
 I heard you mess with broke bitches (Uh, uh) 
 Your car is rented (Uh, uh) 
 And that your trick is (Uh, uh) 
 I heard you slipped in (Uh, uh) 
 They say you senseless (Uh, uh) 
 So now I'm thinking (Uh, uh) 
 If that's the truth then why you telling me it isn't? 
 (Verse 1: Sho Killa) 
 Girl, go on and stop face propping 
 What kind of food you take in? 
 I ain't even know what your ass been doing lately 
 Go 'head and straighten yo act and be a lady 
 Cause the shit I'm hearing evidently got your boy thinking 
 Thinking Imma hit it, then quit it 
 And goddamn she won't miss it 
 And when I'm done girl, go on up your business 
 Show ain't finished but you damn sure is 
 I got 'bout 10 homeboys, take 'em out by your crib 
 And I won't amend cause for you, I lost respect 
 And you were part of my team, but I cut you like a check 
 I be with nothing but the best and you would be a downgrade 
 My heart is cold as ice but I'm 100 in the shades 
 So know not today what I'd trick for you 
 I'd kick you out my ride, I ain't taking you - NOWHERE 
 'Cause with you girl I'm done 
 And you thinking you know about me, but you don't know nothin' 
 (Verse 2: Snow Tha Product) 
 I got like 10 calls with some drama and some randomness 
 Got me kinda wondering if a man like you can handle this 
 Boy, I'm about to have a fit 'cause I just cannot manage it 
 You talking smack and acting like you don't know that I'm the baddest chick 
 I got these haters talking, huh, 'cause they know my whop is up 
 Dollars got my pockets stuffed, they mad cause this chick balling, huh 
 Got them boys talking mess they wishing they could knock this home 
 Saying that they got it but I dropped them when they hollered 
 'Cause I don't mess with broke dudes, so boy don't make me roast you 
 'Cause I done heard around that you be lying about your dough, too 
 So why you acting brand new? Boy, I don't understand you 
 These haters goin' to hate, but look here, I ain't into scandals 
 So, yeah, you need to ask who talking smack about you 
 'Cause I see haters got you angry and thinking bad, too 
 But they ain't got no cash, boo 
 If I was them, I'd be mad, too 
 Haters hate you doing good, so yeah, they going to bash you
