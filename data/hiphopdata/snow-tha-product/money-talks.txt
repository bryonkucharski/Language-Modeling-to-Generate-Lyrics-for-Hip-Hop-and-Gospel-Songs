My money talks, I'm about my paper 
 My money talks, language is translator 
 My money talks, gon need a cash maker 
 My money talks, 'cause my money's so major 
 (Verse 1 - Snow Tha Product) 
 I'm on this grind so hard you can't tell me nothing 
 Doing good, so you just keep up that talking cousin 
 Ain't got no time for these crazy chicken heads to be clucking 
 I'm on tour like a rock star, always in to something 
 I don't got time for the chitter chatter or phone calls 
 If it ain't bout Snow making some money then don't call 
 I'm pushing mixtapes and albums with self-marketing 
 And y'all happen to be falling behind? Well pardon me 
 Let me speed it up a little, so I leave you behind just a little bit more 
 I'm moving up in the game every day, I call the shots and what I say goes 
 Can't talk 'cause I'm on the road 
 Swerve through cars when I put that hate on hold 
 Y'all cookie cutter made, I'm Snow White, the tough cookie that broke the mold 
 Coming through cold, stacking up chips like a Pringles factory worker, oh 
 You ain't know? I'm making moves if you ain't, what you living for? 
 Money talks and I got a lot of conversation, if you mad, you mad cause you don't 
 These presidents coming to me regardless, prodigy and T gon blow 
 (Verse 2 - Tum Tum) 
 Money, moolah, bread I'm chasing 
 You see my watch, no time is wasting 
 UPCC we run this shit, didn't give us nothing we had to take it 
 Middle finger all of them, they didn't believe so fuck 'em tho 
 He probably mad I fucked his ho 
 Damn right, and went back for more 
 Money bags and [?] I swear that I be living fast 
 All day, no sleep, I got to feel that money bag 
 Plus I like to smoke weed and keep my body inked up 
 Versace shades ain't free I got to keep my bands up 
 Summer right around the corner and Imma need a drop top 
 Put out the best product and I can make the block hot 
 Money on my mind, chicken on my plate 
 It's food on the table, bow your head and say grace
