Um... Is this thing on? 
 He said he like his chick to look good 
 Dress fresh, have class, and make money 
 Got her own whip, own crib, and stay stunning 
 And I'm all that, and I'm all that 
 And I'm all that, and I'm all that 
 He like his chick to keep it popping like a cap gun, and I'm she 
 I'm on camera, lights, and action, and big screens 
 And he know that I'm the main attraction 
 And I know he need an independent chick with 
 Long black hair, and that's me 
 He said 'Snowhite Tha Product, keep 'em where they barely have it' 
 'Cause I look good and like milk, I'm always after cake 
 I could tell by his face, he don't even have to say 
 I struck him and left him paralyzed like Drake in his DeGrassi days 
 I got it like I want it, play it like I feel 
 If I got it, then I bought it, popping tags and popping seals 
 I walk it like I talk it and I'm about to make deals 
 And I'm a serial murderer with looks that kill 
 And I'm on the floor killing it, me and my girls is getting it 
 He diligently vigilant, I'm feeling me, I'm feeling him 
 I'm gigging like he tipping me, there's just no concealing me 
 He don't even see the type of girl he trying to have sex with 
 You never seen a Hispanic chick managing 
 To hit the floor and damage it 
 Someone ring the alarm, Snow's hot and people panicking 
 So United Nations, shirt French and shoes Italian 
 Cute but fuck with me you'll get touched like O'Marian 
 I be in Cali and caddies going hammy in 
 I be buying everything in store, even the manikin 
 Barely keeping walking still chop it down in Spanish 
 And no sierra but I'll ride a beat like a stallion 
 Snowhite Tha Product pulling strings like I'm mantling 
 Stacking bags and packing Gats, I'm bad but no one's tattling 
 I'm driving in a Phantom and I keep the trunk rattling 
 Wrists diamond, princess cuts, I be Disney Channeling 
 I be out in Dallas and in Wonderland like Alice 
 And if what I'm sipping's crazy and what I'm smoking is bananas then 
 Boy, I live in Texas and they throw it like a javelin 
 And Snow got that good, I'll make them say
