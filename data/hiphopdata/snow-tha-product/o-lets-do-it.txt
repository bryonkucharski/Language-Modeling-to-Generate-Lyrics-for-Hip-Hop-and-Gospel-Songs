 (Run up or shut up, ya bitch) 
 Snow White 
 Look, yo 
 (Verse 1: Snow Tha Product) 
 I step up in this bitch 
 Guess who showed up with some product pushers 
 I suggest you sit 
 Got held back before I get two shots pucket 
 Get your ass wock or flock, said stupid 
 Trying to come up my block, took him 
 For everything you get shooken 
 Cause around here it is going down like Snooki 
 Get the hell back or get your shit took 
 By a mean ass team but you ain't getting no love 
 How the fuck else you think that 
 I walked in with 25 guys in this club 
 (?) 
 Taking orders from a short ass chick 
 That still don't give a fuck (That's me) 
 You just bought the bar and this night is getting hectic 
 Leaving Texas, DF'ed the VIP section 
 Exit if drinking and smoking ain't on your checklist 
 'Cause we got that fire and your bitch like 'Purple take this' 
 Yeah! Oh let's do it 
 Oh let's do it, oh let's do it 
 Yeah! Drug dealing music 
 I influence, I influence 
 (Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame) 
 One shot, man down, his brains go "ka-pow!" 
 Ow, that shit hurt, so don't fuck around 
 But that happen often off in Riverdale, Georgia 
 You gonna pay the life you live off in Riverdale, Georgia 
 They gonna lay your ass out, rock you to sleep like a baby 
 Hit Squad, shawty, in the hood we got them babies 
 Ever since they killed my nigga Travis 
 Start popping pills and acting crazy 
 Ever since they killed my nigga Travis 
 Start popping pills and acting crazy 
 Yeah! Oh let's do it 
 Oh let's do it, oh let's do it 
 Yeah! Drug dealing music 
 I influence, I influence
