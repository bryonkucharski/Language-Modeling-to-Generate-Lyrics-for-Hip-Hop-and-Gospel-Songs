She could have hella money, hundred stack 
 Gucci, Loui, Prada and a Birkin bag 
 She could have Tig ol' bitties, big ol' ass 
 Still won't guarantee you that you're gonna last 
 Just like I could find a man, with a 5 year plan 
 Get a job and a crib and a some plans with about two kids me 
 Yell at him to get my bills paid 
 And give me everything, I want it in my pay 
 I've been looking for someone to get my feelings back 
 I want my feelings back, I just want my feelings back 
 You can keep on looking for someone to get the feeling back 
 You want that feeling back, I know you want that feeling back 
 Cause ain't nobody gonna get you realer 
 Ain't nobody gonna get you realer 
 Ain't nobody gonna get you realerr 
 Feeling back, feeling back 
 Ain't nobody gonna get you realer 
 Ain't nobody gonna get you realer 
 Ain't nobody gonna get you realer 
 What'd you thought you could get? 
 Get a lil' thought real quick 
 Make the bottle pop with a little [?] 
 Get a pop and you're not gon' trip 
 When you find out that it ain't about the bitch 
 I don't know how real this is about to get 
 So just act clown, but I know you was out here with 
 A couple dumb hoes that still watching this 
 Cause the shit you felt when I was there was real there's no denying that 
 Your pride in the way, that's why you stay lurking where I be at 
 When the, who the, what the fuck you doing baby, why you act? 
 He like, "That your ex?", ooh I know I be mad! 
 'Cause I get me a man with that car that you like 
 And I popped me a Xan and he gave me the ooh 
 And I felt aw damn it doesn't feel right so I mess with my best friend, she was all right 
 But they never been about that though 
 This shit is all about us 
 At the end of the day, we were never the same 
 And you know I'm right 
 I've been looking for someone to get my feelings back 
 I want my feelings back, I just want my feelings back 
 You can keep on looking for someone to get the feeling back 
 You want that feeling back, I know you want that feeling back 
 Cause ain't nobody gonna get you realer 
 Ain't nobody gonna get you realer 
 Ain't nobody gonna get you realer 
 Feeling back, feeling back 
 Ain't nobody gonna get you realer 
 Ain't nobody gonna get you realer 
 Ain't nobody gonna get you realer 
 Feeling back, feeling back 
 I know you want that feeling back 
 Cause ain't nobody gonna get you realer 
 Ain't nobody gonna get you realer 
 Ain't nobody gonna get you realer 
 Feeling back, feeling back 
 Ain't nobody gonna get you realer 
 Ain't nobody gonna get you realer 
 Ain't nobody gonna get you realer 
 Feeling back, feeling back
