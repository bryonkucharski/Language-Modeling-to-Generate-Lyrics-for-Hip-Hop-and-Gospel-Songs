I got a backpack, shades, and a heart that's made of gold 
 And the title of my life: "The Best Story Ever Told" and 
 I think that I'm doing all right 
 So what if I wake up late and party all night? 
 I'm doing fine 
 Pale skin shawty, clay chain hanging 
 All these haters like to talk 
 But I'm still something they can't hang with they blogging at their home 
 I'm out on paid vacation 
 And I would name 'em all by name 
 But that's my time that they've been wasting 
 So I'm kicking back, hanging out 
 Really ain't shit that I'm worried bout 
 I'm just paying my bills, and my mama bills too 
 Your problems seem so basic now 
 Me and my team getting fading now 
 But they're now playing bout while we wait around 
 Two shows one day three tests for the weekend 
 We can't even make it now 
 It seems so funny that they hating what we moving 
 It's kind of crazy, that they chasing what we doing 
 It's kind of lame all these other rappers choose it 
 And start hating on the girls starting to fuck with the movement 
 Come on man, we do it! 
 Hype around snowy anything I say I mean 
 Anything I spit is real as me 
 Anything I do is from my team 
 So we just kicking back making move 
 Hold to get a break for a day or two 
 And even then I got bizz, when I handle in the bit 
 Then is back up on road trip with the wake up crew 
 We woke, we smoke, we wake the game up 
 And we know we go, so go, the game gon' change up 
 This little chick from San Jose'a 
 And I'm taking over mind is made up 
 And I ain't gonna stop, till I cop me a guap 
 Found mansion somewhere rich as fuck 
 And I'm just dreaming big, having fun 
 Still one of the cool kids 
 Then I tell mom that I'm gonna get paid 
 Then I'm stopping all the bullshit 
 'Cause she know she know the money I'm using 
 Till the bills is off of my music 
 And she finally coming around, I told her "Come on man, we do this!"
