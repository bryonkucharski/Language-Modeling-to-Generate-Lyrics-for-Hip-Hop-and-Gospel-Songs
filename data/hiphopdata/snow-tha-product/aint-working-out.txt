It's been seven days and I ain't talk to him or tried 
 He stopped coming by to talk and I know why 
 'Cause it's really been too much to deal 
 What part of this is supposed to be love for real? 
 The fighting, the fussing too much and still somehow I can't hide the fact 
 I feel that I would be the one to really put it all aside 
 The drama, the jealously fights and lies, the gossip they be telling me scars my pride 
 I swear it ain't easy but we've been through so much, I have to try 
 I know he did wrong, I know I slipped, ain't no reason to deny what I did 
 Yeah he took out some chick in my whip, yes I found out and I did not shh... 
 What does he do? He gets mad 'cause I got even but he's a man 
 He said: "You don't get your man back like that" 
 Things get heated and of course I fight back 
 I talk issh, he replies, he talks about girls and I talk about guys 
 He take it too far and of course I cry 
 But you know how things get when you and your man fight 
 Maybe it's me but I think it's him 
 He thinks I'm wrong but in a fight who wins? 
 He's yelling and screaming, you know how things get too elevated, now I'm feeling sick 
 At the end of this fight, I know this is it 
 It's just too hard and I know we both win 
 Doing too much, we both kinda quit 
 Now I already regret what I said and I did 
 But damn! 
 It started out but everything ain't working out 
 And I want to love you but I don't have to work this out 
 You know it started out but everything ain't working out 
 And I wanted to love you but I don't have to work this out 
 Let's chat for a minute 
 Let me get a drink, let me think, let me sit down and talk if you with it 
 I wanna let you know that I got other men that would more than really like to get with a chick that live on her own 
 And her life is filled with international tricks and chills and hot sandy beaches in Brazil 
 So boy calm down, let's keep this real 
 I wanna get a little bit into the fact 
 I wanna feel you really know what you have 
 You gotta appreciate me and get that 
 What you can do, I do right back 
 I don't need you, I mean I like you yeah but my girl told me every guy's a player 
 So I don't let my heart get attached 
 You be lucky to have me in you're like for real 
 So value me and you should know that we are both the same 
 And if this keeps up, we both can leave 
 Just know that I ain't gon' beg and I ain't gon' die if you don't stay here with me 
 So let this be your warning, you be lucky to have a lil' chick like me 
 'Cause I'm independent and I really don't think that there's many women that can do what I do when they speak a sentence 
 I'm a boss, I make all the dough and spend it 
 So just know this, you dealing with a chick that can take you or leave you boy 
 I don't need your shh... 
 It started out but everything ain't working out (Oh...) 
 And I wanted to love you but I don't have to work this out 
 It started out but everything ain't working out 
 And I wanted to love you but I don't have to work this out 
 I just can't wait for you to change cause you ain't getting any of this 
 Oh... 
 Yeah he took out some chick in my whip, yes I found out and I did not shh... 
 Don't bother calling me on my phone cause you ain't getting any of this 
 What you can do, I do right back, I don't need you 
 It started out but everything ain't working out 
 Don't you call me on my phone but I don't have to work this out 
 And I wanted to love you but everything ain't working out 
 Oh... 
 But I don't have to work this out
