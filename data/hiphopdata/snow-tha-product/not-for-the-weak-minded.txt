Music affects your brain 
 Whether people will admit it or not 
 And you don't have to be weak minded for it to do so 
 (Verse 1: Crooked I) 
 All I wanna do is, go harder and harder 
 Get smarter than Harvard, go hard with the Slaughter 
 To keep it one hundred, I think the industry 
 Wanna see a nigga like me depart as a martyr 
 Walking on water, the flow is immaculate 
 Reading off the Dead Sea Scrolls as I'm rapping it 
 The track I'm crashing it 
 Making it look like a Cadillac had a bad accident 
 'Cause y'all ain't passionate, catch a jab to your abdomen 
 Then I'mma tap your chin, I'm a boss, you an applicant 
 Y'all cats pretend (never ever ever rap again) 
 Crooked I kick it in the hood 
 Pistol to protect me 'cause I'm figuring it could 
 Homie, I'm living like a genie in a lamp 
 Rub me wrong, I wish a nigga would 
 Killers ready to get dirty 
 Some niggas who dress nerdy who ain't even touch 30 
 They quiet and ain't wordy, their firing ain't sturdy 
 I've been a couple of light years from any nigga that wanna discern me 
 So callate puto, Breaking Bad and I'm Tuco 
 Got the Hublot hanging out the bulletproof coupe though 
 If you didn't, now you do know! 
 (Hook: Crooked I) 
 Yo, light that up, pour that up 
 Middle finger music, throw that up 
 Act like this 'cause we don't give a fuck 
 (We don't give a fuck) 
 'Cause we don't give a fuck 
 (Verse 2: Crooked I) 
 Why should I, man, with my good eye 
 I can see all y'all snakes so I put my 
 Foot up your ass, kill 'em with success 
 Look how I pass 'em up, I'm like "Goodbye!" 
 Million dollar bitches get fucked in the face 
 If he ain't about money then your husband a waste 
 I'mma switch the scenery up to a bank 
 That's how a real nigga cut to the Chase 
 Pour a little vodka, load the Glock up 
 Then roll some bomb up that'll blow Sadam up 
 Pull up in the drop with Snow Tha Product 
 We don't give a fuck is our code of conduct 
 (Verse 3: Snow Tha Product) 
 I've been at the shit through past due rents 
 Man I've been broke, I've been homeless, shit packed in bins 
 I've been at this since back when tax bracket shit 
 Was way past any practical math I did 
 Now I'm halfway past half to a capitalist 
 Three-fourths day of the year I rap top of the list 
 Now I'm really getting my dividends and stackin' up big 
 Gotta go back to where I'm from to mentally handle this shit 
 'Cause I've been a nobody so long, gonna readjust 
 Get a North Hollywood home 
 Still close enough to deal with bullshit deals 
 But yet far enough to be where Latin folks roam 
 All originality with a capital O 
 So the game wanna see a bitch broke with no soul 
 So I grasp it tight because a chick like me know 
 That I would rob these bitches because old habits die slow 
 Look I never been a punk and I never been a bitch 
 So you bitches better run, we all know the benefits 
 'Cause your 15's done when my 16's hit 
 Heard games are for fun but this game's bullshit 
 Bitch, no I did not come this far to quit 
 This argument is not even real 
 Went from not having a pot to piss to coppin' whips 
 And stocks and casas in hills 
 All these new bitches talking but chill 
 Watch when they get out of pocket, I'll kill 
 Any of them, got plenty of friends, that in any event 
 I'll finish 'em off, no question, no squeal 
 Yes I am tired of all you sluts 
 That been coming in the game cause you bought you butts 
 Now you wanna claim fame 'cause some guy you fucked 
 Is giving you a hood pass, should've passed you up 
 But yup, of course you lie, sit there and organize 
 Try to be more than just hoes, umm 
 Thinking you sort of tight cause someone wrote your lines 
 Thinking you whores have got flow, no 
 You can record the lies, gimme some more so I 
 Finally listen and hear dough 
 'Cause I've been trying to hear competition for a god damn year 
 But don't hear shit but ripoffs and hoes 
 Get off the blow, get up and get y'all a show 
 I have been hitting the road, building my own 
 Little by little but no, I do it all on my own 
 Yes I got dough, I don't split shit but to roll 
 Bitch I can show y'all the ropes 
 All of you hoes that got cosigns, clothesline dry ass 
 Stale ass bitches need those, I don't! 
 (Hook: Crooked I) 
 (Verse 4: Crooked I) 
 In the underground they put me on the throne 
 In the mainstream they say I don't belong 
 Talk about a nigga only good for a freestyle 
 Fuck that, we can go song-for-song 
 Word, I'm killing the best of men 
 Get rid of they next of kin, get rid of the pestilence 
 I give 'em a testament, I'm rebuilding the West 
 And I'm pissing off in the coffin that you resting in 
 Skinny jeans and leggings, you're anything but legend 
 I really bring the weapons, the semi beam behead ya 
 The guillotine'll sever my killing team and catch all my enemies 
 I bet you the ten of these will break you apart, yeah 
 Leaking in a puddle, whole hospital staff meeting in a huddle 
 Trying to figure out how to put your body parts back together 
 Just like the pieces of a puzzle 
 And I'm gone in the wind, yeah, I'm gone in the wind 
 I was fucked up, broke, really 
 Resting my Achilles, I'm balling again 
 Never going broke, say fuck that shit (fuck that shit) 
 Yeah fuck that shit 
 She don't fuck with Snow, fuck that bitch (fuck that bitch) 
 Fuck that bitch 
 Like imagination during masturbation 
 Fuck what you think, what the fuck did you think? 
 The day your opinions can cut me a check 
 That'll be the day I give a fuck what you think 
 You weak minded!
