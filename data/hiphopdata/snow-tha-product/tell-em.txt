Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em this, that 
 Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em this, that 
 Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em this and you can tell 'em that 
 But I'm out getting chips, and where the hell you at? 
 Pockets kinda chunky, call them Campbell's 
 Deep pockets and I'm looking kinda shallow 
 So these haters getting mad 
 'Cause they can't get out my shadow 
 But the product got the weapon 
 And the posse got the ammo 
 If you wanna bust a Rambo I can bust a soprano 
 Cause the click stays strapped like some Jesus sandals 
 I'll be this, I'll be that, but don't believe a word of them 
 Cause that shit's just as fake as the stupid bitch you heard it from 
 I'm killing game and burgling them, spitting flames and burning them 
 These haters don't deserve me, huh, because they mad I'm serving them 
 No time for being worrisome, these haters ain't nothing 
 And I got a poker face with all these bitches bluffing 
 This chick's hot as an oven, the product stopping for nothing 
 I'm popping, locking, and busting, these chickens off and be clucking 
 So watch me get my dumb kids and ride this thing out 
 Snow tha product's in this bitch, whatchu gotta say now? 
 (Verse 2: Snow Tha Product) 
 Tell them all that you done letting me in and that I'm stuck up 
 That I ain't ever going to do shit and that I'm fucked up 
 Tell them whatever you want 'cause I am what's up 
 And I know that you mad 'cause you're trash, dump truck 
 So run your mouth, tell your buddies that I'm not the shit 
 But when they get my mixtape and you're not hot as this 
 You about to watch your friends turn around the opposite 
 Direction as you question how can they be down with product bitch 
 So tell tell tell stories just as fake as you 
 And talk talk talk just as much as all haters do 
 And every time you talk music, bring my name up, boo 
 Cause every time you talk shit I'm your mamma's crib, I'm making loot 
 So bitter haters make your YouTube comments 
 'Cause I'm the shit and your boo boo honest 
 So let me do me while you do not shit 
 Money talks but you ain't even on the same topic
