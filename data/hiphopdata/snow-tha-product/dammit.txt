Yeah yeah yeah he used to be a player 
 Used to say he's getting that paper 
 And he used to call my friends haters 
 'Cause they told me he was unfaithful 
 Yeah, he used to say he work late but 
 Then, all them lies that he made up 
 Really wasn't shit when I caught him with a chick 
 Then I had to cut 'em off like a razor 
 Now I only care about my riches 
 Got my, got my M with them sixes 
 Cut my hair and got six inch heels 
 Get killed when I hit that switching 
 Now he talking about that he misses 
 Says he really wanna make his misses 
 Now he said he really wanna make me his Mrs 
 He said he stopped with them bitches 
 I said boy that ain't none of my business 
 Got my ex-es saying damn it 
 Miss-missing what they had 
 Now they begging for me back 
 And Imma fucking take advantage 
 Saying damn it, damn it 
 I got my ex-es saying damn it, damn it 
 I got my ex-es saying damn it, damn it, damn it 
 Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it 
 I got my ex-es saying damn it, damn it, damn it 
 Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it 
 He used to act like he was pimping 
 Brag about bitches he been with 
 Used to talk that mess about he winning 
 Used to drive around in that Lincoln 
 Now he got some stupid girl pregnant 
 Got himself two dependents 
 At his momma's house with no credit 
 He's all bad and got 2 infants 
 Meanwhile I been getting my cheese up 
 Swiping Debit and Visas 
 Mind my business and I re'd up 
 That little thing got a little bit of G's up 
 In my piggy bank and getting hella features 
 And in my aide in a beast cut 
 And ain't no telling when you fucking with a felon 
 Who been dealing with a whole lot of believers 
 This guy that I used to date 
 Used to act like everything gray 
 But he used to fuck with girls like all day 
 Then he left me for some ho around the way 
 But to say in goes, the players get played 
 Girl fucked his bro and gave his ass shade 
 Boy he beat her ass and called her gay 
 And then he just so happens to call me the other day 
 See now he calling me something crazy 
 Been 'bout me having this baby 
 Said he swear thinking about me lately 
 I'm like damn that girl gave you shady 
 Cause you broke now, you got no style 
 And she left you with no car 
 Meanwhile I've been coming up in the game 
 And then shit change, you're a bum and I'm a star
