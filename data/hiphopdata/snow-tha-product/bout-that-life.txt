Yo, look 
 Always been the type to overthink 
 Which caused all this fear in me 
 But I ain't never been scared 
 And I been full aware 
 But the truth in this shit killin' me 
 'Cause I know this world 
 And I know a girl 
 Like me ain't really gonna change it all 
 But I know I've worked 
 And I know they heard 
 That me and my partners came to ball 
 And ain't nothing gonn' stop this 
 'Cause I do it for more than my pockets 
 And I do it for more than just dough 
 There's more to Miss Snow 
 Find out 'fore you talk shit 
 'Cause I got a crew of kids that's involved 
 I do this music for y'all 
 I'm out here touring this hard 
 Just know this winner won't fall 
 And I go HAM 'cause I know my chances 
 Have gone by half cause [?] 
 And I know I'm gonn' have to be all I can 
 Cause all my fam seeing all this 
 Man tell 'em that am gonn' need all this cash (now) 
 I'mma take it to Vegas 
 Paid dues so I'll cash out 
 While these haters all hating 
 I'mma live 
 Cups get fucked up, cause things are workin' out 
 There's buzz up in the lobby and we're what they talkin' 'bout 
 Tell 'em that I'm 'bout that life 
 (Elevator to the top) 
 Tell 'em that I'm 'bout that life 
 (Been workin' with what we got) 
 So now we're cups up, get fucked up cause things are workin' out 
 There's buzz up in the lobby and we're what they talkin' 'bout 
 Tell 'em that I'm 'bout that life 
 (Elevator to the top) 
 Tell 'em that I'm 'bout that life 
 (Been workin' with what we got) 
 Man, I've been about it 
 Everyone but this pen has doubted 
 Look bro, I been alone 
 And I been at home 
 Wit' like 20 in the bank but the rent's a thousand 
 Had a one bedroom 
 And I built me a booth 
 Paid for Pro Tools 
 Got a pull out couch 
 Slept in the living room 
 Made Ramen Noodle soup 
 No food don't tell me what being down is 
 I've worked for this 
 Let 'em know what my verses is 
 When I'm in the booth and I heard a bitch 
 Tryna talk down if she ain't heard my shit? 
 Man, I ain't got no time for that 
 I grind it out my mind as I got [?] 
 I done been out findin' out 
 What life's about 
 I'm tryna see past, all the negativity 
 That these bitches be 
 Tryna throw my way, 'cause I spinnin' these 
 Little cold ass verses 
 I'm visiting, a couple of cities a day and they be feeling me 
 Cause man, I been workin' so long 
 Cause this game is all about rhymin' 
 I hustle days in, hustle dapes in 
 Now they payin' for my rhymes and I'm getting 
 Cake cake cake cake (ah) 
 Man, I'm gettin' paid so fuck the 
 Hate hate hate hate 
 Man, that's if you hate I'm paid 
 And so now they havin' opinions 
 Back in the day they didn't cop my tape 
 They didn't not give a shit so fuck they feelings (ah) 
 Tell 'em put me on 
 Tell I'mma shine 
 Cause don't nobody know what I been through 
 'Cause it's a crime 
 But I'm 'bout that life 
 (I'm 'bout that life, mayne) 
 Tell 'em I'mma be all right 
 (I think we gon' be all right)
