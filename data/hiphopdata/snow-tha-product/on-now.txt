I got like a thousand reasons to quit this shit 
 One big reason and not 
 I'm that long haired chick with a bunch of shoes 
 That got 45 grand in a box 
 I put it on mind then I'm raising the stocks 
 Check me online, you can think of what I got 
 But I guarantee that you coming up short 
 'Cause I'm more offline and I'm more on the block 
 And I still throw up that west like Pac 
 And I'm old cool like record shops 
 Little hot chick that mess get hot 
 Little setback but I progressed a lot 
 And I'm blessed a lot, I object to the fraud 
 Till I get the props, yes I'm hot, little better with the crop 
 That the best you got, and I'm still that mex, that flex up top 
 And I got that skin tone that they love to hate 
 Smoking and sipping that bubbly 
 And these haters still try to bring me down 
 So they bring me up when they conversate 
 'Cause I live down south but I'm from the bay 
 No business bitch I'm accompanied 
 If you ain't stick with me you ain't getting shit 
 When we finally break any fucking day 
 Cause these prodigal minds and I means it 
 My bars bring fire as the weed did 
 Any bitch say she don't wanna no beefing 
 If she do then I'm gonna make her vegan 
 'Cause I've been this and I've seen this 
 And I speak this 'cause I know 
 Everybody far from the game 'cause they know about the name 
 But they still tryna keep me on the low 
 When I be like motherfuckers scared to colab with me 
 Still say they real in the magazines 
 But they don't wanna get killed on the track I spill 
 With rap I'm giving no apology 
 Cause see, all these bitches all photo shoots 
 And all diva chicks in ghost written shit 
 But I'm killing it and I swear this falls 
 I'm finna hurt more than just feelings, bitch 
 Motherfuckers talking but don't really make a sound 
 You see everybody calling when you finally get around 
 That we on now, always going down 
 Say that when you know we in your town 
 Now we telling 'bout getting back without you in the track 
 Now they getting flats now we getting cash where we at 
 Now they feeling that, now we finna back 'cause we can 
 So we been in that, now we get the chance to hit it where 
 We on now, always going down 
 Say that when you know we in your town 
 Pull up in the Maserati, I wear pitch black 
 I'm still the king, y'all admit that 
 Real nigga riding the game, he can't get back 
 I don't give a fuck about your bitch, get that 
 If a nigga want to be a thug, Imma show 'em what to do 
 Get your head chopped off like [?] 
 Everybody in the hood love me, know you 
 I've been in the gut, what the fuck you gonna do 
 Fuck you, tell them niggas I was in it for the win 
 Rise so high nigga should've been a swing 
 Yeah [?] 
 Go so hard in this track, nigga here we go again 
 I'mma fuck a nigga, wanna get no shit with me 
 I been in the Benz since '93, I make a nigga rewrite shit and get lost 
 Had people looking for you all OTP 
 Put him in the box, I put him in the river 
 Say you got ice, hope a nigga don't shiver 
 Your shit trash, should've been rid off 
 My shit cool, your shit look bitter 
 Look fuck nigga, I'm the king of Texas 
 South, west side, where the hood get reckless 
 Should sit down like I get restless 
 Certified fake nigga, ain't no guessing 
 Rapped the aces, but to the motherfuckas down the corner cause [?] 
 I do it for the team, nigga, worth your time 
 Nigga fuck get mad, nigga better get dough 
 Shoe box nigga better get low 
 I lean on a nigga like a [?] 
 Ask more shit, nigga better get low
