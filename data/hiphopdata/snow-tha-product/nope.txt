Tell me whatcha talkin' 'bout, I'll tell you whatcha missin' 
 I be sellin' product like I'm workin' on commission 
 Ya'll can you say you ballin', but you thristy and you stingy 
 So as far as I'm concerned, yo ass a fuckin' contradiction 
 Snowy independent, Snowy in my business 
 I just tell em keep it moving like I'm teaching 'em some physics 
 Bad little chick, you wanna put me in detention 
 I got A-D-H-D, good luck keeping my attention 
 I got digits in my calculator, dividends and bank accounts 
 Broker like an aggregator, making money, making clout 
 Write it up, break it down, checks in major paid amounts 
 "Ding-ding-ding", like I'm winning, that the Vegas sound 
 He called me up, saying he wanna talk a bit 
 He wanna fuss, talkin' bout he saw me in... 
 He talk too much, I just keep it moderate 
 He mentioned us, us?! He got the fist 
 (Heard around you ballin') Yup, don't call me though 
 (Money in your wallet) Yup, don't call me though 
 (Like to go shopping) Yup, Don't call me though 
 (Why you acting brand new, telling me "Don't call me?!") 
 Cause I'mma be like "nope, nope, nope" 
 I'mma be like "nope, nope, nope" 
 Nope, no-no-no, nope 
 I'mma be like "nope, nope, nope, nope" 
 RiFF RAFF picture perfect, Versace on the surface, I never shop at Mervyn's 
 It's a sterling chain, I don't rock that, Mercedes with the top back 
 The way I'm shootin' jumps, you figured I play for the Bobcats 
 Charlotte, my chain is sparkling and Neiman Marcus 
 Is darker, I beg your pardon, that Aston Martin 
 And you are on the bench, I still woulda made a starter 
 I am not your father, I go ten times harder 
 Further or farther, and when they jot down my stats 
 They take notes, with Gucci markers 
 Marvelous, stupendous, your Mazda suspension 
 They pretend to not to notice that I pull up on suicide blades 
 Pull up at [?] Garth Brooks taper fade 
 Jody Highroller the name, mind frame's not the same 
 Round up cows, settled out west, I got a range
