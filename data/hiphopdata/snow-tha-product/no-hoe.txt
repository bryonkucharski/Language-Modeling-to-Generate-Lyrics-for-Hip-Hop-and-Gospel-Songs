 I met a girl named Angelina, she's from the south like Reba 
 She's 5 foot 5, Latina booty, R.I.P. Selena 
 She was like, "Girl, I like your rap, I thought I'd let you know that 
 If you give me a backstage pass, you can have all of this --" 
 And I was like, "Whoa! Oh no. That ain't how it go (go) 
 I'm here to do shows, get this whole crowd WOKE 
 And look, everybody knows that ain't how it go 
 Yes, I will sign those, but girl I ain't no ho"

 There was another boy named Jason 
 He kicked it with the kids that be ravin' 
 He asked me what was my occupation 
 And I was like, "I do entertainment." 
 He said, "Tight. You strip? You do anything extra for tips? 
 Do you keep it strickly stripping' like these chicks? 
 Would you like to pop it for profit and see chips?" 
 I was like, "Whoa! Oh no. I'm a rapper named Snow 
 Even if I did strip, it ain't no joke 
 I can get you prostitutes but you're gonna need to know 
 That a stripper's a stripper, and a ho is a ho." 
 Cause some girls on the low, need to learn how it go 
 'Cause they acting hella hoeish but ain't getting no dough 
 Some girls broke hoes and they don't even know 
 I was like, "Whoa! I ain't no ho"
