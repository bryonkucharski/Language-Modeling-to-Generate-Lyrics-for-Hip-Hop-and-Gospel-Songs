Fuck tha rent, fuck tha rent, fuck tha rent 
 Famous by tomorrow, fuck it all 
 Yelling fuck tha rent, fuck tha rent 
 Fuck the bills, fuck it all 
 I'm just trying to get famous by tomorrow 
 Look, I'm working, I'm fucking working 
 I'm seeing profits and I ain't perfect 
 Cause nobody's perfect, I dropped out of college 
 But I'll resurface with new beats and verses 
 They checkin' out my bars 
 And they got me daydreaming about cars 
 And getting me in over my friend's all 
 Got a girl like fuck the work (fuck the world) 
 It's just me and my crew 
 And we all sitin' on this ledge 
 Overlooking the city with a bunch of brew 
 When we had your flavs, 'cause they much to do 
 But to really kick back and just talk bout who 
 And who gon' do, what, when, where, and how when we get on 
 Always 'bout to be so cool and we gonna party hard 
 And we gonna travel a lot, need a very ballin 
 And brag bout what we got, we gonna valley park 
 No more Value Mart, no more getting dogged at the laundry 
 We're gonna make it, yeah we gon' make it 
 So fuck the drama and all them bills, oh yeah them bills 
 I'll hit 'em up manana 
 They say tomorrow ain't promised and today is today's gift 
 And I live for presence, I learn my lesson 
 I'm done with stressing over payment 
 I got my crew that I came with 
 Then I'll give you food for all of that lame shit 
 No time for foolishness I hatin' 
 We working all day till we famous 
 Some of these lames just sound so basic 
 Talkin' about M.O.B. is some gay shit 
 We making avenues for that revenue 
 When no sense in being impatient 
 I got no car payments, but I got two cars 
 I'm not famous but I'm gone too far 
 We are waiting to get on majors 
 We're conversating in how we get bout to be on 
 It's cope and static, I'm living life 
 This dough I'm getting I'm spend it right 
 I'm motivated, they overrated 
 We on the way to get the game (Hell yeah) 
 We're gonna make it, yeah we gonna make it 
 So fuck the drama and all them bills, oh yeah them bills 
 I'll hit 'em up manana
