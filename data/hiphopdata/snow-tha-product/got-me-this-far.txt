I put it on mine 
 I own everything you see me in 
 I'm twice your advanced, guess that makes you intermediate 
 Bitches out here flexing, I guess they ain't eat they wheaties yet 
 But bitch I'm so good they be trying to find all the ingredients 
 A little dash of ghetto with a couple cups of lean 
 Sweet like amaretto, gutter like a glass of Henn 
 Little prada like the devil but I guess you'll never see 
 Your btch on a higher level, that's really kept it this G 
 Everyday I hear shit about how I got to change 
 How I gotta adapt to the game 
 Ay, I know I'm stubborn, stuck I'm my ways 
 I called shots and that is not gonna change cause 
 That's what got me this far 
 All by myself, just me and my ADD 
 Who'da known when I was 5 I'd get paid off my ABC's 
 In rap all I'm in a lane ain't nobody pave for me 
 So this road been hella dirty but mexicans made to clean 
 So I've been in, making it hella sweet but I hear you talking shit 
 So what I bring to the table, imma eat and wash my dish 
 I'm humble and talk my shit cause nobody gave me a map 
 When I get to where I'm going fuck you I ain't going back 
 Cause every man in my career say my attitude is bad 
 'Cause I'm skeptical, I question anything I fucking ask 
 So why would anyone get mad, if I was a man id be a boss 
 'Cause I wanna know what's out there, every win and every loss 
 Every expense and every cost and every pinch and every drop 
 Cause everything I've ever brought, I brought the team, I swear to god 
 If I was doing this for me, I'd ease up a bit 
 But I got many more to feed, this shit's for us, ya bitch 
 That's what got me this far
