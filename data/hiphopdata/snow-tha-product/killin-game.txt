Check the clothes, che-che-check the clothes 
 Popping daily so I, popping daily so I 
 Get them real men like what, what 
 Put your damn cups up, ugh yep 
 You should know that Snowhite is what's up 
 Double dodging stuff, I hit the stage and make the club jump 
 Bass beating down your block, so I call it tough love 
 Snowhite the Mastermind, guard your fucking brain, ho 
 I be murdering these tracks, no contest, case closed 
 And I got my hands all up in this shit like Play-Doh 
 Many mobile shit this little chick is getting pesos 
 Rap off the tacky bitches, stacking chips, and making loot 
 If I'm that specific, I be making hella loot 
 And if you want it bad enough, then I'd suggest you get it, too 
 Chain looking like captain crunch, the stones are yellow, red, and blue 
 When I got that bass, like boom, make them say "Ooh" 
 When I go and hit the floor, they see a Latin chick that moves 
 Snow Tha Product, go get her, killing game, bitch 
 Sneezing when I see you, I'm allergic to your lameness 
 I've been balling since before you kids was out of elementary 
 Original at this, and all you is is just a parody 
 So I walk hysterically they look at me they cherish me 
 And I ain't got to ask a mirror who the fuck the fairest be 
 Snowhite, Miss Pale-Skin, game killer playing this 
 Walk it like I talk it, first I do it then I say it, boo 
 You be with the lamest dudes that saving hoes, they saving you 
 I'm a real money getter, and a real fucking winner, and I'm doing what I came to do 
 Fix your fucking face when you looking at a real chick 
 Bitch, I'm getting cake, and been up 'bout this for a minute 
 If you ain't got shit to say then close your fucking mouth and pay attention 
 I'm the real kinda girl and I shouldn't got to mention 
 I'm the best, you know, you can check the clothes 
 From the head to toes, like a badge to bow 
 So you can close your mouth and you can clean your chin 
 Bitches doing when they see the fresher gucci shit I'm in
