(Intro: Slim Thug) 
 Yo, this your boy, Slim Thug 
 Hollering at Snowhite Tha Product 
 (Verse 1: Snow Tha Product) 
 The future of the west just came to this third coast 
 Now my fanbase expanded and I tripled my workload 
 Now when I'm driving by, thry asking 'Man! What that work, Snow?' 
 I'm like 'If you want something like this, just hit the chirp phone' 
 Smoking on that purfome and I just drove from Cali 
 And I got a show in Houston, Dallas, and (?) 
 And I got that work in the trunk like Chingos bringing some baggies 
 And I can't complain like most 'cause I got that money coming at me 
 And I never really thought that I would leave the west 
 But I did it and I ended up in the state of Tex 
 And I keep going hard for my Mexicans 
 'Cause I'll be damned if I don't ever represent 
 See I'm still up on the block pushing these mixtapes, physically 
 I run the streets get your product for fixed rates, literally 
 Get at me 
 (Chorus: set to A Flock of Seagulls "I Ran") 
 I run, the streets all night and day (the hood love Thug) 
 'Cause I still run, the streets all night and day 
 (If you trying to find me) 
 (I rep for my city, go hard for the hood) 
 (Still posted on the block, what's good?) 
 And I run, the streets all night and day (ha) 
 I can't stay away 
 (Verse 2: Slim Thug) 
 They don't make too many niggas like me 
 Bonifide hustler, certified G 
 Still got that work if you got the right fee 
 You thinking shit fake? Well nigga come see 
 It's bigger than the jewels, it's bigger than the cars 
 It's bigger than the fact that we fucking rap stars 
 The street niggas know me, these boys got my contacts 
 Knowing any given minute I can come back 
 I put a bitch on I-10 and tell her run that 
 Give her ten and tell her don't bring nothing back 
 I'm still in the hood, I can't leave the streets 
 It's in my blood, I'm a thug till I be deceased
