I finally feel like, I can go ahead and say 
 Shit that I ain't ever been able to say before 
 Y'know what I mean? Like... 
 This is for all the awkward moments 
 And the high school memories 
 And all the fucking popular kids I allowed to get to me 
 The fact that I was broke and I knew my family had necessities 
 And so everything added up, inside of me, depressing me 
 The fact my dad was gone and I couldn't even say rest in peace 
 Cause leaving us was worse than dying 
 Here's for forgetting me 
 Here's to finally admitting that now it's off my chest and see 
 Here's to being sad and only happy when on ecstasy 
 Here's for all the fake friends, the rumors, and the lies 
 Here's for all the fake trends I was to broke to buy 
 Here's for all that time wasted with those stupid guys 
 Here's to bottles of stolen liquor and all them crazy nights 
 And thank you to the haters. Thank you to the teachers 
 'Fuck you' to the cheerleaders, I'll watch while on the bleachers 
 Thank you to myself for staying true to graphic t-shirts and the tennis shoes 
 And back packs, headphones, and all the reefer 
 I'ma make it! 
 I'ma make it! [repeated]
