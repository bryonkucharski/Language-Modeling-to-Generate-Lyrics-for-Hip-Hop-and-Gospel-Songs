Bro, I am not about to be up in this rap game 
 Being "Mexican, cha cha" and shit 
 This "All work, No credit" shit is done, bro 
 I'm not gonna take that shit no more 
 I ain't fuckin' with y'all 
 I got you motherfuckas talking, huh 
 But it don't mind, got that heavin' Monster in my cup 
 No slowin' down, got my palms itching for the pesos 
 I'm bout to turn up on the game like what the fuck I came fo' 
 I swear to God, all you hype beasts trying me 
 Like I ain't have your favorite labels tryna sign me 
 Like I ain't bout to make this publishing or writing 
 Like it ain't these fraudulent bitches, that's how you bitin' me 
 This shit grimy 
 Okay, but fuck that, I ain't playing the part 
 I'ma switch it up on you bitches 
 Oh you don't like me trynna stay low-key 
 Oh me, oh my shit's different 
 'Cause I'll take it back, way back, back to Cadillac '85 
 I'll take ya trap, give it back, statin' facts that my shit gon ride 
 Low-key, I'm outchea, I'm bout to get it 
 It ain't no going back, I'm bout to kill it 
 See I be playing games, but I've been chilling 
 Y'all on some fuck shit, and I ain't with it 
 Low-key, I'm outchea, I'm bout to get it 
 It ain't no going back, I'm bout to kill it 
 See I be playing games, but I've been chilling 
 Y'all on some fuck shit, and I ain't with it 
 Now, what the fuck you think I rap for free? 
 Man, all you silly bitches hatin', go and grab a seat 
 'Cause I been out here on some humble shit, just tryna eat 
 But y'all keep acting like I won't come out and drag a skeez 
 Over but y'all gon see, y'all gon see 
 I'm a Texas livin' Cali chick 
 That mean I own a .45 and I can carry it 
 That mean I fucking own some property from selling shit 
 Ho, what you think I don't got Product Pushas chasin' grip 
 Finna make it big 
 Man I'm really thinking that lately, this game just like to push hoes 
 'Cause I been giving y'all bars for days, and I swear to y'all the lord knows 
 That I ain't bragged not one time bout all the shit in they songs 
 But I'm bout to flip this shit real quick this chick finna get her dough 
 Low-key, I'm outchea, I'm bout to get it 
 It ain't no going back, I'm bout to kill it 
 See I be playing games, but I've been chilling 
 Y'all on some fuck shit, and I ain't with it 
 Low-key, I'm outchea, I'm bout to get it 
 It ain't no going back, I'm bout to kill it 
 See I be playing games, but I've been chilling 
 Y'all on some fuck shit, and I ain't with it 
 Low-key, I'm outchea, I'm bout to get it 
 It ain't no going back, I'm bout to kill it 
 See I be playing games, but I've been chilling 
 Y'all on some fuck shit, and I ain't with it
