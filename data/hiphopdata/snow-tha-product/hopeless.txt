Woke up with a pocket full of change 
 And a laundry list full of problems 
 And the only thing that keep me sane is that I know everybody got em 
 I got a mom yellin' out, "Go to college!" 
 Got a bong full of weed, it's ironic 
 'Cause the only thing that solve this dramas hollerin out, "fuck all them" 
 I'm gonna make today my bitch 
 Got a backpack on and I'm headed for a new flight, and yes I binge 
 With my headphones on and my mind is gone and I can no longer think 
 Having metaphors and I read 'em all 
 And now I obsess, over life and death, and how I can get 
 To be someone that matters because if life's a test 
 Then how the fuck am I gonna ace this shit, how the hell am I gonna make it in this shit 
 When I'm just a chick caught up in the mix, get ten chips off of mixtapes and shit 
 My mama says that I better face this shit 
 This game's all eyes and it's based on it 
 So basically I'm looking if Hotel California has another vacancy 
 They talking drugs, clothes, cars, checks 
 Drugs, hoes, more respect 
 Don't blame the hopeless that's the only thing promoted 
 You need change, put it in motion, excuse me for being open but 
 Here I am (come on) 
 Knocked down but still I stand (come on) 
 Come to my shows and visit my fans 
 So they can tell you how I real I am, and still hope now 
 When the shows out, we leave the show, to the dope house 
 Pick up the weed for the smokeout 
 Smoke up to the sun up, no sleep but I'm still 'bout to turn up, uh 
 Come on, niggas that don't know my name, know exactly what the fuck I ain't 
 Hearin' my voice, duh nigga and ain't for fame 
 I want the money but it ain't the same, (nah it ain't the same) 
 Same dog finna take off, finna take off 
 My day off should be playoffs, then we playoff 
 Another meeting with the AR, fuck waitin' I'ma play hard 
 I got the game in my hands, they done gave me a chance 
 So now I'm finna show you niggas how to rock out 
 Really smokey when I hop out 
 Gettin' detention like the NBA lockout 
 Headed to the top now, good weed got 'em knocked out 
 Good weed got me on my shit, that's why I'm on my shit 
 Focused but to you that don't mean shit, y'all niggas don't want me rich (that's cool) 
 That's cool, that's cool 
 Break down only when I break down 
 Every hero gotta put the cape down 
 'Cause what we gonna do when they ain't round? 
 Hold up, Snow and Diz, have the product to propose a hit 
 What's the best way we can show the kids? 
 Who the motherfucking coldest is? 
 Still move
