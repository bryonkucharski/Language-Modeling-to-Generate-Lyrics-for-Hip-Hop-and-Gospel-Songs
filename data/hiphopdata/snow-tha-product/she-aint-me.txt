There we go again, yeah yeah 
 Bragging to your friends, friends friends 
 Talking bout that hood rat, chick that 
 I seen you with before 
 And like you would what, 
 I see you and I know we both know that she ain't me 
 She she she, she ain't me me 
 She she she ain't me 
 She she she ain't me 
 She ain't me 
 I bet you think it, drives and be crazy 
 When I see you with a bunch of chicks 
 But it's quality over quantity baby 
 And they ain't even close to this 
 I'm the best you had, I'm best you get 
 So it's all downhill after this 
 Boy you can date all the boppers in the world 
 'Cause I'm positive this girl is the one you'll never forget 
 'Cause I'm a motherfuckin swag out, Prada bag out, little shopper 
 Bet a million, that you won't find another hotter 
 Little hot spitter with a gazillion offers 
 Had a gold mine but you was out chasing copper 
 So my phone stay ringing, folks stay grinning 
 Cause everybody know that you're losing bro 
 When you broke lil women, you're so not winning 
 I'm disappointed cause you keep choosing hoes 
 I know that you reminisce 
 And you probably wishin that it was different 
 And I know that you thinkin' about what could've been 
 Now you gotta deal with that instead of this 
 'Cause I guarantee you I was the realest chick 
 Never hold you with, now we're so different 
 Little scally wag hologram, all these bad hoes 
 Holy crap, I bet I could pull a better bitch 
 There we go again, yeah yeah 
 Bragging to your friends, friends friends 
 Talking bout that hood rat, chick that 
 I seen you with before 
 And like you would what, 
 I see you and I know we both know that she ain't me 
 Think I seen you approach then what's happening 
 And you try to play it off like you happy babe 
 But I know if you really were, you wouldn't call me then 
 I know you wouldn't have deleted all that commentents 
 Cause you sharing my shit, you sure be textin 
 You sure be all over my post and my pics 
 I know you know it, just none of your bizz 
 If you was really happy, you sure don't make sense 
 'Cause I know you seen that new car I bought 
 And you text me and notice that I'm working out 
 Since we broke up you frequent the bar a lot 
 And you stressin me, what the hell you worry bout? 
 Cause my phone stay ringing, folks stay grinning 
 Cause everybody know that you're losing bro 
 When you broke lil women, you're so not winning 
 I'm disappointed cause you keep choosing hoes 
 See I know you know that you're messing up 
 Cause you went from the best to just decent chicks 
 And it's funny when my home girls said you dumb 
 You realized while she was talkin' and you see an in 
 You ain't got much to say so you plea the 5th 
 And you startin to see the thing about freedom is 
 It's not worth it when you had it perfect 
 Certain chick and I believe that was me 
 Here we go again, yeah yeah 
 Bragging to your friends, friends friends 
 Talking bout that hood rat, chick that 
 I seen you with before 
 And like you would what, 
 I see you and I know we both know that she ain't me 
 She she she, she ain't me me 
 She she she ain't me 
 She she she ain't me 
 She ain't me yeah yeah 
 She ain't me 
 She ain't me yeah yeah 
 She ain't me 
 She...
