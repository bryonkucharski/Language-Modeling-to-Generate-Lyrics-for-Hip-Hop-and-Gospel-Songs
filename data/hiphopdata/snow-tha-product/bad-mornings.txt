So we just keep it movin', movin' 
 Movin', movin', movin', movin' 
 Hate it's the cheapest hobby you can have 
 So we gonna make it to the top 
 And keep makin' these haters mad 
 Just keep it movin' 
 I'm a, just keep it moving, while I roll like this 
 I got plenty of old friends that don't get dough like this 
 So let me just pick up the phone and order 4 or 5 big 
 Bottles to pop while we're on top and run the show like this 
 I know I should have never brag but damn it feel too great 
 That when they hated, I created more new songs they played 
 And I just took this struggle and stride took day by day 
 And now I'm coming up to the top and yep we came to stay 
 I got these haters talkin' but I just seem to keep on movin' 
 I'm just chillin', looking icy, keep it real and keep it cool 
 And makin' money makin' moves, and living life with something to prove 
 Cause life's a teacher, I'm the student 
 I'm just learning what I'm doing and ain't really much to do 
 But give me the best in the world 
 They say that life's a bitch 
 I hope that bitch like Mexican girls and hey 
 Just give me the best in the world 
 They say that life's a bitch 
 I hope that bitches like Mexican girls 
 So we just keep it movin', movin' 
 Movin', movin', movin', movin' 
 Hate it's the cheapest hobby you can have 
 So we gonna make it to the top 
 And keep makin' these haters mad 
 Just keep it movin' 
 It's hard coming in the game, when you hop in the beat 
 The weakest said, so instead of simply being happy for me 
 You just some haters that my privacy need 
 Back to the streets, and back to struggling for money 
 And back to having cds 
 Up in my back pack and sellin' em, pitchin' em 
 One by one, they want me to back track to when I was struggling selling none 
 I used to wish that I could live it up tourin' and havin' fun 
 I want mom to top floor and got my haters lookin' up 
 'Cause they wanna bring me down but my team and I moving 
 We're sippin' on a 40 edition with my crew 
 We keep it movin', oh yeah we keep it movin' 
 I got my product pushas' back because I know they got mine 
 I always chop it up with them, but these haters get no time 
 I got these kids are down for me, so I don't care about co signs 
 Cause co signs are for bad credit 
 My credit is just fine 
 So we just keep it movin', movin' 
 Movin', movin', movin', movin' 
 Hate it's the cheapest hobby you can have 
 So we gonna make it to the top 
 And keep makin' these haters mad 
 Just keep it movin'
