I know that you don't smoke 
 But you know I got that fire 
 And I'll be good to go 
 I don't even gotta light up 
 One shot for the chick with the cash 
 Ain't scared to be independent 
 I just hopped in the whip and I dipped real quick 
 And I think Imma have to pay you a visit 
 I've been drinking a bit in the club 
 Got with the team and we living it up 
 Thinking of you and what happened to us 
 'Cause when I say "fuck it," I don't give a fuck 
 I just say that, say that, say that, say that 
 Love it how you don't take that, take that, take that, take that, take that 
 'Cause I know you mad 
 But if you see me, your attitude might change up 
 I know it's bad, but if you sleepy I'm hoping you might wake up 
 Babe I've been throwing up (throwing up) 
 Rolled a blunt (rolled a blunt) 
 Popped a bottle (popped a bottle) 
 Slowed it up (Slowed it up) 
 I'm about to show you what you like (what you like) 
 I'm about to show you what you like (what you like) 
 Might've overdone it with the liquor 
 What do you expect from the girl from "Drunk Love"? 
 I'm bad at relationships, I play till it's too late 
 And I hit you with the "Wassup?" 
 Same shit - you fuck up, I get fucked up 
 Then your number get clocked and I run up 
 My pedestal, cause you been this full 
 Of shit, since the day I met you when I was young 
 And I used to fall for your stuff 
 But now I'm grown enough to know - fuck trust 
 I just really have to hit you when I'm buzzed up 
 Numb the feeling and deal with the rush of 
 Just hitting you up, picking you up 
 You leave your car and you'll get in my truck 
 We get away for a week and a month 
 Then drop you off like I don't give a fuck 
 But I say that, say that, say that, say that 
 Love it how you don't take that, take that, take that, take that, take that 
 Look I've been hella tired of this drama on the low 
 But if you free tonight, I got a spot that we can go
