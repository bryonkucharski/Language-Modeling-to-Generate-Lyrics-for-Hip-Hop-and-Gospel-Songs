spoken: 
 I mean, like, this song goes hella hard (laughs) 
 I don't want G-Eazy to be mad at me or nothing 
 I just really like this song... 
 Pardon my Español, but hola güey 
 Look I done popped on the scene and I'm suave 
 Us Cali rappers gas on 'em no low octane 
 Tours 40 days headlining, no off days 
 Cortezes, eyeliner, love my chola ways 
 Still really not concerned what you hoes all say 
 That is not my job that is yo job, babe 
 Look I'm from Killa California, bitch you don't want fades 
 Went from sellin' yadamean to these co-op days 
 Got my business structured, bitch I get dough all day 
 I'm just gettin' braggadocious, mane don't mind me 
 But I came a ways from flea markets yellin', "Comprale!" 
 I'll take it way back, Greyhound, Redwood City 
 Had the Bay sound when I came out rappin' like, "Fuck wit' me" 
 San Jose shark in daygo cause life was good to me 
 Now I'm in Hollywood, finna pop fans lovin' me 
 Goin' far 
 They used to tell me 
 I couldn't go too far alone (Far Alone) 
 They used to always say 
 I couldn't go too far alone (Far Alone) 
 But now I'm here, bitch! 
 My parents had a combined income of 20k 
 Went and quadrupled that shit in one good day 
 So everything from now on is just icing on the cake 
 Even on my bad days I just open up the safe 
 I done went from no job, no income comin' 
 To several smart investments, check Miss Snow's budget 
 Nobody gonna tell me shit if you wasn't 
 With me in '07 slangin' tapes, no buddy 
 Back when I was sellin' tickets to open in SD 
 When producers said "To make it best, dress sexy" 
 Mexi, Lil' chick, backpack, best trees 
 Yes me hustle, big shouts BMSB 
 Think I'm not gone make it when they doubt all this shit 
 When I got on, they was on superficial fake shit 
 Fake wigs, fake nails, fake ass, fake tits 
 I done came to bring the real, now they copy pastin' 
 Wait bitch, keep it simple, never basic 
 Way that I was getting snubbed, you would think they racist 
 Tank shit taught me be a shark 
 Play this rap game for what it's worth 
 Switch it up and bank quick, so here we go 
 They used to tell me 
 I couldn't go too far alone (Far Alone) 
 They used to always say 
 I couldn't go too far alone (Far Alone) 
 But now I'm here, bitch! 
 But now I'm here, bitch!
