I guess the cash rules everything around me 
 I need to change my ways 
 I've been trying but I need to change my ways 
 Half of the time, I don't know where I'm at, I'll be tripping and shit 
 I'm not famous or unknown but this can get to you quick 
 I'll sip on a little alcohol and I'll be dabbling on some drugs 
 I'm not telling you what to do, but if you haven't then trust 
 Don't do it, shit'll get you fucked up 
 Or have you feeling numb once and you be falling in love 
 Aww man, you mean I don't gotta feel no more? 
 You mean I can live in my head, dreams won't get killed no more? 
 I can erase whatever happened and I don't gotta deal no more? 
 I mean you can, but then you're back and shit ain't real no more 
 You gotta backtrack and shit, go back to where you left it all 
 Thought you left it all, but nope, this shit will get you lost 
 Now you're right back but more depressed than when you left 
 You gotta 'fess to the bullshit feelings of emptiness 
 And now you're tripping, everyone thinking that you're okay 
 But now you're slipping, late nights you laying in your bed 
 And you start thinking, how the fuck am I gonna matter? 
 I wanna change but I need change, so I'm making my pockets fatter 
 Cause the cash rules everything aroound 
 What are we even here for? 
 My generation is lame, so you start like 
 Dear Lord, please help me to get some change 
 I need some cash, I need it fast, I need a job that I like 
 Imma need someone on my bed that'll make me feel it's all right 
 These negative thoughts in my head that be making me think twice 
 About everything I'm doing when I'm just trying to do right 
 Going up like elevators, cause Andre used to talk to me 
 But he's been gone lately, so I be looking for him constantly 
 I need some Lauryn, Pun, Pac, and some Eminem 
 I need some artists that I can listen to like way back when 
 I need a lot, fuck, I need peace of mind 
 And you only get that with accounts with a couple G's aside 
 For this empathy inside, 'cause I know we all need 
 Artists need to humanize, 'cause I know we all bleed 
 And I know I can't cop half the shit that rappers nowadays get 
 But I kinda be thinking that Imma need to help this generation
