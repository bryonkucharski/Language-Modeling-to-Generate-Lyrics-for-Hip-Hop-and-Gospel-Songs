I try my best to not think about you 
 But when I look at all my texts 
 It seems you know just what to do 
 I get to reading all the rest so by the time I even get to yours 
 I'm like I think I'll check if I ain't got nothing to do 
 Umm but I do and I try 
 To keep myself away from you for the night 
 'Cause I know that if I 
 Keep playing with fire I'mma have to decide 
 But I don't even think I want to 
 'Cause I know what I'd do 
 'Cause I know it's the thought that haunts me when I think about you 
 Cause see I'm not type to start something but not see it through 
 So you may get it hard to take it when I start with you 
 Now I ain't tryna jump into nothing right now 
 So as soon as I start thinking something, I'm out 
 Ain't even really tryna get involved, and you calling and I'm oh 
 Like fuck it, let's drink together, I'm down 
 And when I'm kinda faded 
 We get to conversating 
 And there we are 
 There we are 
 I kinda start to say shit 
 And then it's getting late 
 And I don't know where we are 
 Where we are 
 But when the drinks get to clinking baby (it's alright) 
 You start to tell me what you're thinking lately (Is that right?) 
 'Cause we both rather turn up than try to get turned down 
 It's better to have fun for the night 
 You were putting up to go although I'm taking 
 Texting all late like you don't know what you've been waiting 
 You've got me asking myself why am I enabling? 
 All of these feelings, man I don't know what I'm thinking 
 But I just kick, I really don't know what it is 
 I guess that it's just persistent, think it over again 
 'Cause it'd be constantly taunting, we thinking of you 
 I think it's gotta be yaby 'cause this isn't new 
 And when we both get to sipping baby, you know why 
 This conversation comes incriminating in no mind 
 I think I start to feel the buzz and I keep talking about drugs 
 Even though I know what's up, and I know it ain't right 
 And I ain't tryna jump into nothing right now 
 So as soon as I start thinking something, I'm out 
 Ain't even really tryna get involved, and you calling and I'm oh 
 Like fuck it, let's drink together, I'm down
