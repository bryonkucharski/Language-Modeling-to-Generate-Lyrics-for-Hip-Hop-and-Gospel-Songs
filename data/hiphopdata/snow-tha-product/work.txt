Work 
 Work for it, work for it 
 Show me how you do it when somebody tryna pay for it

 And the way you pop it, you got it popping 
 It’s a knockout how you’re dropping, now can’t nobody stop it

 You working all night, you must be on the grave shift 
 You working all night, taking off like a spaceship 
 I said baby quit playing, go and work 
 Like you hot up on the spot 
 Work it like you up on the clock, clock 
 I could take you to the top, I could take you to the scene 
 Living life like you’re in a dream 
 He telling me to work for it, but I’m somebody you got to deserve to get 
 He like why don’t you twerk a bit 
 Cause I’m a pimp, I got game like a tournament 
 You say you love me like Rico

 Said he loving my Cee-Lo cause little mama’s neck is on frio

 Stunting in the club, grabbed a couple stacks of ones
