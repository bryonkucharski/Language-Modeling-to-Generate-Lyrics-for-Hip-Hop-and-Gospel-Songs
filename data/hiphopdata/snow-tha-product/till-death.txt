I would've wanted this to work 
 But apparently you don't 
 Now you got me looking crazy 
 While I'm watching you alone 
 You might just say 
 That I've up and lost it 
 But Till death do us part 
 I'm a make you keep your promise 
 You were my everything you gave me a diamond ring 
 Made me be the chick all these bitches was hating 
 While I was waiting things where changing and 
 You started to play games fly to Beijing 
 But, but your game was amazing 
 You happened to blame things 
 On me that I ain't think 
 That you were the one fucking around 
 And made it seem 
 That I was the one that was messing up everything 
 Parked outside in my old black ride 
 Thinking about every single fucking tear I cried 
 Now I can't decide between the.40 and the.9 
 And as smart as I been all my life 
 That I'd fall for your lies 
 How'd I waste this time 
 How I did not know why you were out there prying 
 On these immature chicks while I'm at home pissed 
 Doin' the cooking and the cleaning 
 While you're living it big 
 Fuck that, fuck that 
 I got the rope and cuffs 
 Have a black hennessy toast to us 
 I am outside of your job and I'm posted up 
 And don't think that these 2 bullets are for both of us 
 Till death do us part, one to the heart 
 Take two to the head, don't get me {started} 
 It's a shame that you played 
 And got brave with the lady 
 That also happens to be a little bit crazy 
 I'm making you pay, you're takin' my pain 
 Now you make way for the brand new me 
 When it's good it's good, bad is bad 
 It's about to get real real bad, you see 
 Good girls go bad, but when they're gone They're Gone for good 
 Now one bad girl gon' get you gone 
 And one bad move is all it took 
 I would've wanted this to work 
 But apparently you don't 
 Now you got me looking crazy 
 While I'm watching you alone 
 You might just say 
 That I've up and lost it 
 But Till death do us part 
 I'm a make you keep your promise 
 Now First off let me start with a congratulations 
 Five months ago you denied it but you got to face it 
 Say that you wasn't cheating then who got her pregnant? 
 Quickly apologize and I ain't got time for fake shit 
 Take your sad face and show it to the judge 
 You should've known that this was meant for you and that ho fuck 
 Hold up don't you try to even touch my hand 
 If you think I'm taking you back you are out of luck my man 
 Love don't live here no mo' 
 When you walked out I'm 'bout to lock that door 
 Sorry Jack I believe you gotta hit that road 
 And I hope you got what you wanted out of that ho 
 'Cause I know she a turnt up heifer by the way 
 I seen her ass looking at my boy the other day 
 Her eyes wander for the man with no pay 
 And after this divorce you got no shot OK? 
 God damn you stupid for cheating on this 
 Especially for doing it with that stupid ass bitch 
 Mom said you was no good and you proven that quick 
 And you really really dumb for thinking you is that slick 
 All the people that I cut out of my life for you 
 Everyone know I was a perfect wife for you 
 I was ready to take the coke charges that night for you 
 I took a stand I motherfucking lied for you 
 But I don't blame myself it wasn't my fault 
 I got a clear conscious and life moves on 
 I'll find a good man but me and you both know 
 You'll never find a better woman than me hell no! 
 You need to get your shit and go 
 'For I grab that ruger and put it to your throat 
 I really feel like evening out the sco' 
 But I don't wanna catch a case for you 
 You a joke 
 I would've wanted this to work 
 But apparently you don't 
 Now you got me looking crazy 
 While I'm watching you alone 
 You might just say 
 That I've up and lost it 
 But Till death do us part 
 I'm a make you keep your promise
