Man I got a call 'bout 11 o'clock 
 So I had to step out and step in the garage 
 And as I looked down and I checked who had called 
 I had noticed it was you and I text you to stop 
 I had to hit you with the "not now" with the "hold up" 
 Even though you know I'm not down you like "so what" 
 I'm looking at the bigger picture but you want a close up 
 What we had is in the past now you wanna show up 
 I remember what you put me through 
 And I remember what you did when you did what you did back then 
 Now you wanna come around like I'm supposed to be down 
 Trying to fuck up everything and the situation I'm in 
 Hold up 
 Girl, I just wanna kick it 1 time 
 I ain't worried 'bout your man, hell naw I don't mind 
 What he don't know won't hurt him 
 I guess the saying is true when it pertain to you 
 Cause you be missing what you have like it's a thing to do 
 You left a dollar for a dime and now when things improve 
 You wanna call me up, talking 'bout "I'm swinging through" 
 And with them late night texts, talking all that mess 
 Saying to give you one night cause you were my best 
 Boy I don't really pay no mind to anything I've left 
 It must be something that you're missing, but I digress 
 I got a business meeting, no visiting 
 You be trippin' and hitting me up 
 Just to kick it and such 
 Now you tryna chill in the cut 
 Bet that isn't enough 
 Hit you with the "mmm hold up" 
 All I need is one time with ya 
 One more goodbye 
 One last kiss, one last try 
 He don't know you like I do girl 
 He don't hold you like I do girl 
 And to tell you the truth 
 He ain't got enough money to handle you girl
