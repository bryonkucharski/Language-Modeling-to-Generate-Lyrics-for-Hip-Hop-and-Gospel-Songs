Yo, look, I woke up with my attitude, Kanye 
 I don't give a fuck what my mom say 
 Okay, maybe a little bit, but only 'cause I'm really not tryna start up any beef with my madre 
 But in my mind, today I'm Beyoncé 
 I don't wanna hear whatever y'all say 
 I'm a beast, give me monster, no latte 
 Wearin' all black, like I'm robbin' you in broad day 
 I had one too many bad nights 
 Today I don't wanna hear no advice 
 So all of you little bitches, act nice 
 I don't wanna fuckin' have to ask twice 
 Bitch, any other day but not hoy 
 You can even hear the tone of my voice 
 Today my grind is pumped up on 'roids 
 Today my ego's gassed up, like Floyd 
 Look, I swear to God, the life I live, has got my mom, like, ay, ay, ay 
 All my bro's that's sellin' O's, that kush, that dro, that white 
 What you want? Them bars, Patron, that got you on that, ay, ay, ay 
 Tryna roll, you lose control, we on that level, don't try, ay, ay 
 Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay 
 Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay 
 Yo, look, my mama kicked me out, 'cause I was partyin' like YOLO 
 Woke me up for church, I was hungover, she's like, "oh, no" 
 Gave my ass a bucket, trapeador, and got the Cloro 
 Pitbull jacked my mom, since I was a baby she yellin' 'Como!?' 
 She like: ¿Cómo que no? Ponte a trapear 
 Todo lo que compro te doy, ponte a limpiar 
 Pantalones rotos y ya ponte a lavar 
 Aquí no tienen voto, carnal, pónteme al par 
 Aquí no comen si no se aconviven 
 Si aquí no ayudan, aquí ya no viven 
 Si aquí no das, aquí ya no recibes 
 Y pónganse en linea, que esto ya no es chiste 
 Que a mi no me importa que Heather no ayuda 
 Muchacha huevona, allá su mamá 
 Por ahí la vi con el novio que tiene 
 De aqui a nueve meses que ya son papás 
 Pinche malandro nomas pa' robar 
 Es poquitero, rapero local 
 Y Claudia no quiero que siguas al mal 
 Y pobre de ti que si andas igual! (mom!) 
 Look, I swear to God, the life I live, has got my mom, like, ay, ay, ay
