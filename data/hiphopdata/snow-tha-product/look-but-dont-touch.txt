Cause we young, fly, and flashy and we don't give a fuck 
 I'm just walking with my partners and we tearing up the club 
 Don't touch (You can look but) 
 Don't touch (You can look but) 
 Don't touch (You can look but) 
 Don't touch (You can look but) 
 Guess who's fresher than the veggie, no reggie, all perk 
 Guess who drove up in this Chevy, already got work 
 It's that click of loud kids with two cases of Privilege 
 All of y'all wishing but you should face it, we living this 
 Club hopping, wasted, new generation 
 Walk up in the scene, fit, mean, and we got them hatin' 
 Party like a rocker, no, party like a college kid 
 Pop some in, we pop some more, won't remember what we did 
 All up in the club, boys staring and they checking us 
 Crew doing big, going hard and got us flexing bucks 
 Chain is on my chest is, uh, sick, no congestion, bruh 
 Been up all night and it's 2am and the best is yet to come 
 Go, go, go, like a P-p-power Ranger 
 And I blow more dro till I can't think an hour later 
 I'm living for the moment and I still don't give a fuck 
 And all you haters free to look but I suggest you don't touch 
 Pink and black Dunks, tight, and my jacket dumb bright 
 Stunners on my face and got the place going in one night 
 All I got's this one life, so Imma live it up 
 And I know the bartender, so my cups is filling up 
 And I got these boys saying 'what's up' 
 And I go the club showing me love 
 So Imma get up in the middle with the flow and show them Snow be going d-dumb 
 Me and my girls know how to stunt on some evil cannibal stuff 
 Get the place crunk, come with us, and you 'gon see what's up 
 Get it big, spilling drinks, sipping on expensive shit 
 Living big, getting chicks, spending all them Benjamins 
 Get the whip 'cause I think we 'gon have to dip again 
 Another party down the block and we 'gon start this shit again 
 Go, go, go, like a P-p-power Ranger 
 And I blow more dro till I can't think an hour later 
 I'm living for the moment and I still don't give a f-fuck 
 And all you haters I suggest you don't t-touch
