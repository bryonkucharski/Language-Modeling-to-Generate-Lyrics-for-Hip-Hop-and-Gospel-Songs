MC-Ren : "Yo Dre, how much time we got left on ths tape?" 
 Dre : "About a couple of minutes." 
 MC-Ren : "Well let me bust a freestyle then." 
 Dre : "Awright, go ahead." 
 (MC-Ren) 
 Ruthless gangsta, definition villain, 
 Leave your shit unlocked and he's stealin', 
 So call tha police cause that's all you could do but, 
 He'll get away without leavin' a clue. 
 Dre : "Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this shit. Eh yo Yella boy why don't you rewind it.Hey 
 Man you gotta get more hyped up tonight!" 
 MC-Ren : "Damn, why don't you pump this shit up so it could fuck up my eardrums a little bit!" 
 Dre : "All right bet." 
 (MC-Ren) 
 Ruthless gangsta, definition villain, 
 Leave your shit unlocked and he's stealin', 
 So call tha police cause that's all you could do but, 
 He'll get away without leavin' a clue. 
 Keepin' shit in control like the neighboorhood chief but, 
 Referred to as a walking thief, 
 They say he's a bad influence for the kids on the block, 
 Why the fuck they blamin' him, 
 He's the one that they jock. 
 Keepin' niggaz in line, 
 Whoever fucks with his rhyme, 
 And before you fuck with him, 
 You gotta fuck with his nine. 
 Not scared to pull the trigger on a punk ass nigga, 
 (A nigga) He could whoop his ass 'cause he's bigger. 
 Size don't mean shit, 
 He's from the old school fool, 
 He's a villain from the streets, 
 And he's supposed to rule, 
 Not sayin' he's in shit, 
 But he's down for mine, 
 He was put on the streets to keep niggaz in line. 
 Never givin' a fuck, 
 (Huh?) 
 Because I know that he's a nigga that you want to be. 
 He can't help it he's in shit, 
 But he don't hold shit back, 
 He's a gangsta in black, 
 And he's about to attack. 
 (Eazy-E) 
 'Cause I'm a ruthless villain, 
 Cold tearin' shit up, 
 Don't come on my face, 
 Pumpin' no kind of junk, 
 Eazy-E's in control, 
 And if you press your luck, 
 I'll smoke you like that, 
 And won't give a fuck. 
 "Nickname Eazy-E... Ol' 8-Ball junkie!" 
 (MC-Ren) 
 Ruthless gangsta, definition villain, 
 You can lock up yo' shit, 
 He's Still Stealin', 
 Gettin' respect, 
 Cause the boy kicks butt, 
 But the real meaning is, 
 He don't give a fuck, 
 It's Eazy-E in the crowd, 
 But he's not in the 4, 
 I tell his money flow, 
 As he collects from his ho', 
 All expenses paid, 
 For the rhymes that he made, 
 Got the trophys in the house, 
 For the girls that he laid. 
 Not a wimp he's a pimp, 
 Now of course he's the boss, 
 So keep your bitch out his face, 
 Or else she's gonna get tossed. 
 The hard to be fucked with, 
 The boy got heart, 
 Wanna fuck with him, 
 He'll Rip your head apart. 
 Gangsta Gangsta, 
 That's what they yellin' 
 But him with his gangsta stroll, 
 He keeps bailin'. 
 Wherever he goes, 
 There's no discussion but silence. 
 They say that he's the one, 
 Promotin' gang violence, 
 That's a lie just a critic, 
 All that whack bullshit, 
 So let me tell you motherfuckers, 
 Who you fuckin' with, 
 (Eazy-E) 
 'Cause I'm a ruthless villain, 
 Cold tearin' shit up, 
 Don't come on my face, 
 Pumpin' no kind of junk, 
 Eazy-E's in control, 
 And if you press your luck, 
 I'll smoke you like that, 
 And won't give a fuck. 
 Eazy-E : "Yo Ren?" 
 MC-Ren : "What's up?" 
 Eazy-E : "Let's get the fuck outta here!"
