I don't drink brass monkey, like to be funky 
 Nickname Eazy-E your 8 ball junkie 
 Bass drum kickin', to show my shit 
 Rap a hole in my dick, boy I don't quit 
 Crowd rocking motherfucker from around the way 
 I got a six shooter yo mean hombre 
 Rolling through the hood to find the boys kick dust and cuss crank up some noise 
 Police on my drawers, I have to pause 
 40 ounce in my lap and it's freezing my balls 
 Hook a right turn and let the boys go past 
 Then I say to myself, They can kiss my ass 
 Hip to get drunk got the 8 in my lips 
 Put in the old tape Marvin Gaye's greatest hits 
 Turn the shit up had the bass cold whomping 
 Cruising through the east side south of Compton 
 See a big ass and I say word 
 I took a look at the face, and the bitch was to the curb 
 Hoes on my tip for the title I'm holding 
 Eazy-E's fucked up and got the 8 ball rolling 
 Riding on Slauson down towards Crenshaw 
 Turned down south, to dish the law 
 Stopped at a light and had a fit 
 'Cause a Mexican almost wrecked my shit 
 Flipped his ass off, put it to the floor 
 Bottle was empty so I went to the store 
 Nigga on till 'cause I was drunk 
 See ya sissy as punk had to go in my trunk 
 Reached inside 'cause it's like that 
 Came back out with a silver Gat 
 Fired at the punk and it was all because 
 I had to show the nigga what time it was 
 Put up the jam and, like a mirage 
 A sissy like that got out of Dodge 
 Sucker on me, 'cause the title I'm holdin' 
 Eazy-E's fucked up and got the 8 ball rollin' 
 Old E's 800 'cause that's my plan 
 Take it in a bottle, 40, quart, or can 
 Drink it like a madman, yes I do 
 Fuck the police, and a 5-0 too 
 Stepped at a party I was drunk as hell 
 Three bitches already said "Eric yo breath smells" 
 40-ounce in hand, that's what I got 
 "Yo man, you see Eazy hurlin' in the parkin' lot?" 
 Stepped on yo foot, cold dissed yo ho 
 Asked her to dance and she said "Hell, no" 
 Called her a bitch, 'cause that's the rule 
 Boys in the hood tryin' to keep me cool 
 Tell me, homeboy, you wanna kick my butt? 
 I walked in your face and we get 'em up 
 I start drivin' the dog, and watch you fold 
 Just dumb, full of cum, got num dot co 
 "Make you look sick, ya snotty-nose prick 
 Now your fly bitch is all over his dick" 
 Punk got dropped, 'cause the title I'm holdin' 
 Eazy-E's fucked up and got the 8-ball rollin' 
 Pass the broom, motherfucker, while I tear shit up 
 And y'all listen up close to roll-call 
 Eazy-E's in the place, I got money and juice 
 Rendezvous with me and we make the deuce 
 Dre makes the beat so god-damn funky 
 Do the 0-8, fuck the brass monkey 
 Ice Cube writes the rhymes that I say 
 Hail to the niggas from CIA 
 Crazy D is down and in effect 
 We make hardcore jams, so fuck respect 
 Make a toast, pumpy pump to the title I'm holdin' 
 Eazy-E's fucked up and got the 8-ball rollin'
