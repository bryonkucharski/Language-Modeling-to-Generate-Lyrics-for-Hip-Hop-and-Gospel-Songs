(I'm sittin' here writin a song about baby'z mothers who try to 
 Sue the daddies for child support. Even though daddy is takin' care 
 Of the baby but the mother's just, you know, scandalous, not 
 Just like this hey) 
 Fuck my baby'z mama 
 The bitch got drama 
 Fuck my baby'z mama 
 'Cause she's the type o' bitch that wanna see me broke 
 Broker than a joke, bitch stole my role 
 And every time I see the bitch she needs cash 
 She make me wanna slap her ass 
 Triflin bitch always got me in a fit 
 The low-life-Compton-shoppin-swap-me trick 
 I wanna kill the ho 
 Then slam her in the trunc of my six fo' 
 'Cause yo, that ho made my dick grow 
 And now her lawyer's at every show 
 Waitin for me to kick in my dough 
 But before I go I'm on death row 
 'Cause the bitch had too much drama... 
 Fuck my baby'z mama! 
 FUCK MY BABY'Z MAMA! (7x) 
 (Trick bitch!) 
 Fuck my baby'z mama! 
 Fuck my baby'z mama 
 The bitch got drama 
 And I'm not the one 
 I should just knock her punk ass out 
 While I'm in court payin' child support 
 But then I gotta deal with the father and the steel 
 And he's the type o' nigga that a nigga's gotta kill 
 Make me kick up a grip, I don't like her 
 'Cause the bitch is buyin skirts instead of dipers 
 Beggin so much to hold hands it's startin to look like cuffs 
 I wish I never fucked 
 But now it's too late 
 How much you made? 
 'Cause accordin to your income 
 You might have to spend some 
 Time behind bars 
 Now ya find it hard 
 Never thought a bitch would pull a stunt like this 
 I can't do another day with Pamela 
 So I'm a pay ya, Anna 
 But I just like to say... 
 I think of all the money that I spent on a lawyer 
 I used to be an employer 
 But now I'm just an employee filin bankruptcy 
 But now the punk bitch can't touch me 
 Huh! I only call her to check up on my daughter 
 So now she's got a restraining order 
 Put me to the curb and had the nerve to axks a bower or dime 
 Bitch, you must be outcha rabid ass mind 
 Huh! Love for start will take much, you see, the bitch broke me 
 So now I need a crutch 
 But you gotta understand a judge don't give a fuck 
 About a young nigga that's down on his luck 
 So I gotta put the P down and be down for the calls 
 And give the bitch back her drawers 
 So if ya drivin' by and ya see her 
 Do me favor, give the bitch the finger 
 Fuck her! 
 You biiiiiiiiiitch! 
 (Insert:)

 Go to hell! 
 We dedicate this number to you, haha 
 This one's for youuuu! 
 This evening's news report: See ya 'round, buddy boy...
