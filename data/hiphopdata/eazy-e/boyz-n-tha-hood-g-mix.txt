Yeah, gangsta Dresta steps in this muthafucka and this one goes out tah all 
 The 
 O.G.'s out there and I can't forget about the baby gangstaz, what's up 
 Niggaz, my 
 Nigga they came back with some of that old school original west coast shit 
 Nigga that 
 Got all of y'all in this dig in the first place yeah so run that shit E, yeah 
 ... 
 Verse One: 
 Cruisin' down tha street in my '64 
 Jackin' tha freaks clocking tha dough 
 Went to tha park tah get the scoop 
 Knuckleheads out there come shootin' some hoop 
 A car pulls up who can it be 
 A fresh El Camino rollin' Kilo G 
 He rolled down his window and he started to say 
 It's all about makin' that GTA 
 'Cause tha boyz in tha hood are always hard 
 Ya come talkin' that trash we'll pull ya cord 
 Knowin' nothin' in life but tah be legit 
 Don't quote me boy 'cause I ain't said shit 
 (Straight up, straight up, straight up gangsta wrong nigga tah fuck wit 
 Straight up, straight up, straight up gangsta wrong nigga tah fuck wit) 
 Verse Two: 
 Dotomy's in tha place tah give me the pace 
 He said my man JD is on free-base 
 Tha boy JD was a friend of mine 
 Till I caught him in my car trying tah steal a alpine 
 I chase him up tha street tah call a truce 
 Tha silly cluckhead pulls out a deuce deuce 
 Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge 
 One sucka dead L.A. Times front page 
 (Punk, punk muthafuckaz like it ain't no thang, 
 Punk, punk muthafuckaz like it ain't no thang) 
 Verse Three: 
 Bored as fuck and I wanna get ill 
 So I went to a place where my homeboyz chill 
 Niggaz out there makin' that dolla' 
 I pulled up in my '64 Impala 
 They greet me wit a 40 and I start drinkin' 
 And from tha 8-ball my breath start stinkin' 
 Enough tah get my girl tah rock that body 
 Before I left I hit tha Bacardi 
 I went to her house tah get her out of the pad 
 Dumb hoe said something that made me mad 
 She said something that I couldn't believe 
 So I grabbed tha stupid bitch by her nappy-ass weave 
 She started talkin' shit what did ya know 
 Reached back like a pimp slapped tha hoe 
 Her father jumped up and he started tah shout 
 So I bombed on pops knocked his old ass out 
 (And if a brotha talks shit I give him a, 
 And if a brotha talks shit I give him a, 
 And if a brotha talks shit I give him a) 
 Verse Four: 
 Now I'm rollin' hard now under control 
 Them wrapped tha '64 around a telephone pole 
 I looked at my car and I said,"Oh brother!" 
 Thrown in the gutter and go buy another 
 Walkin' home and I see tha G-ride 
 Now Kat is drivin' Kilo on tha side 
 As they busted a U they got pulled over 
 A undercovered cop in a dark green Nova 
 Now Kat got beat for resisting arrest 
 He socked tha pig in tha head for rippin' his Guess 
 No
