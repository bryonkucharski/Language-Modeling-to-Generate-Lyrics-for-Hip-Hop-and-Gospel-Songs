(All right Go) 
 This comes from the E Chapter 8 verse 10 and it reads 
 Its time to put some niggaz in check 
 When you shoot a gun, hot shells eject 
 Catch'em they get used as evidence 
 Only when they get brushed for finger prints 
 You ask Why am I like this? 
 'Cause you wanna hear about shit like this 
 So I tell it, how I know it, Just hope the fuck I don't show it 
 Niggaz out frontn, lottering and looting. 
 Lets recreate a drive by shooting 
 More brothers in a car blocks away 
 Waiting to spray, shotgun, Mack10 and an AK 
 They roll through to a line of nigga's 
 It was 9 just like tha fuck they figured 
 Go around tha corner come back real slow 
 Lights off, cars in neutral, rolln at a snails pace and creepn 
 Hoping to catch all of them sleepn, a so called gang, drugs and sex (NWA) 
 Start busting a cap and all tha others jet, 3 of'em fall to their doom 
 Pronounced dead at the scence, with gun shot wounds 
 3 dead 'cause Compton is scanless. 
 I'd like to tell ya brother, Ashes to Ashes, Dust to Dust (Amen) 
 Daaaaaaaaa, daaaaaaa, daaaaaaa 
 (You will now witness tha sound of ??) (We will now pass around tha hat) 
 (That's good enough) No it ain't, you fucked up, you fucked up (its cool) no 
 It ain't
