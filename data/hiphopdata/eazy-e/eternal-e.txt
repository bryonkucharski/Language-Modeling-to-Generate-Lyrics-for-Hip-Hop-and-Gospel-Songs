 Yo this is Yella 
 As we wine down to the final song 
 I wanted to make this one to remember my lil nigga E 
 I know he wanted this track on his record 
 Though he was takin' from us to god damn soon 
 So I finished for him peace nigga... 
 (Eazy-E) 
 We did a song fuck da police you know 
 And everybody been hearing fuck sayin' 
 Fuck da police for years and years and years 
 And finally it took a muthaphukka to video tape 
 A nigga gettin' the shit beat out of him 
 For everybody else to say fuck da police 
 And we did fuck da police people put us down 
 And sayed we were ahead of our time you know it 
 Took the video you know ya shot by accident 
 To tell the truth and open the worlds eyes 
 Yes we do have a serious problem in L.A 
 And other citys true retaliate happens all the time 
 People tryin' to change things for years but I don't 
 Think anything is gonna help the problem is to deep 
 N.W.A. is just being brutally honest 
 City of Compton

 City of, City of Compton baby baby

 They swearin' on cable TV it ain't teachin' 
 Nobody nothin' new cause little kids grow up 
 You know one, two years old hearin' there mother 
 Sayin' fuck this, you little son of bitch I beat 
 The shit out of you and all this shit and you know 
 They pick up from all the shit and you know so they 
 Learn shit you know it's not gonna be teachin' 
 Muthaphukkaz nothin' new 'cause I got some new words 
 For your ass 
 (Eazy-E) 
 We don't tell you to go out and gang bang 
 We tell you ya know and our songs is as you 
 Know if you could go out stealin' and killin' 
 And beatin' up people all day but that person 
 Ends up dead or in jail sometimes he gets away 
 You know and we don't have no rags no red no blue 
 Rags and tellin' we gonna go out and creep or go 
 Out and do that other thing or whateva it is 
 You know we ain't tell you to be joinin' no gang 
 Or whateva else 
 Rollin' Down 
 Rollin' Down
