Inside the minds of real g's 
 Death row is looked upon as the studio gansters of the 90's 
 A joke hahahaha in a gamecalled 5 minutes of fame you wasted 
 4 mimutes now you got seconds left kick it 
 Come one come all and let me ride nigga 
 Eazy-e cpt how the hell you figure 
 To be the best on the west hu ya 
 Fool loked down this is east side nigga 
 South comton and I put it on the map 
 So when a dog pound crip you wanna scrap 
 And that comin' straight from the ruthless gangster eazy-e 
 Now what would I do haha lets see 
 Now I would take on sugas locked down the row 
 Since Dre is a bitch pimp slap the hoe 
 Now I'm seeing doubles man two dogs in a huddle 
 Aa god dame now diggidi daze I biggidi blast

 So come with it fool and test your luck and

 With the cavey ass flow as I kreep through the street 
 Peeping niggas from death row bet you wanna know 
 Which one make the best hoe so 
 Let me break it down as I'm lost in the mist 
 And take word of advice and don't come fucking with this
