 And the bitch that was yours will be mine buddy 
 All because ya woofed on a nigga that was nutty 
 And I had to make an example 
 Nigga thinks I'm crazy now but that was just a sample 
 Of a nigga with street wise reality 
 That don't give a fuck type Compton mentality 
 I stare back death right in the face 
 Contemplate my last day on and everyday base 
 Cause a nigga neva know when he go 
 I hope it only takes one shot 
 'Cause I don't wanna die slow 
 My funeral will be full of my peers 
 People that neva gave a fuck about me droppin' 
 Threw me tears 
 I hope I'm in the casket face down 
 So all you muthafuckers can kiss my black ass now 
 And fuck all that cryin' all night 
 Just be happy that I'm rid of this fucked up life
