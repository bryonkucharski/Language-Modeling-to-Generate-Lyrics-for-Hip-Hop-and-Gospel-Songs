Aw shit, let's take a trip 
 Just sit back and light a spliff to this and don't step 
 On a funky-ass track jump back 
 Strapped with a gat and a sack and a 7-8 flak 
 Come clean, gangsta lean, I got green 
 But I serve dubs like it ain't no thing 
 I hang with OG niggas don't set trip 
 Or you might get a slug in your fuckin' back 
 I don't slack when it come to street 
 I kick real g shit to a gangsta beat 
 It's so sweet, when you got money to spend 
 I got a cool-ass tilt and a fly-ass Benz 
 I make ends, spend my dough on no ho 
 That's how it is, nad that's how it goes 
 Act like ya know when I creep real slow 
 Givin' love to them niggas that I know is real g's 
 If you got love for them gangstas 
 Let me hear you one time if you down for the crime (that's right fool) 
 If you got love for them hustlas 
 Let me hear you say hoo if you makin' straight dough (hoo!) 
 If you got love for them playas 
 Let me hear you say ooh, ladies we want you (ooh!) 
 If you got love for them straight g's 
 Let me hear you motherfuckers just scream (heeeeeeey!) 
 The Ruthless network, drive-by expert 
 Straight outta Compton, kickin up dust 
 The Ruthless network, drive-by expert 
 Straight outta Compton... 
 Dump dump on a nigga with a quickness 
 And they got no cure for this sickness 
 I get paid for the way that I kick this 
 Like a g-ster, an OG-ster (who's that?) 
 A real nigga named Eazy 
 And I live my life straight crazy 
 Don't need no punk niggas payin' me 
 And broke groupie-ass bitches don't faze me 
 I take two step back and release myself 
 To put platinum-ass cuts on the record shelf 
 I don't brag, but I tell it like it straight-up is 
 Before you do a record, nigga, handle your business 
 And don't get caught slippin on the under 
 Or you might wonder (what's up with them ends, nigga?) 
 I call a spade a spade and get paid 
 G's show the way, so I give love to 'em 
 If you got love for them gangstas 
 Let me hear you one time if you down for the crime (that's right fool) 
 If you got love for them hustlas 
 Let me hear you say hoo if you makin' straight dough (hoo!) 
 If you got love for them playas 
 Let me hear you say ooh, ladies we want you (ooh!) 
 If you got love for them straight g's 
 Let me hear you motherfuckers just scream (heeeeeeey!) 
 E-A-Z-Y, must I 
 Chase the cat and be a dog, a straight-up hog 
 I leapfrog to the sound of a gangsta beat 
 So I can hear my shit bumpin on a Compton street 
 That OG, C-R-I-P and S, G and S 
 Hip-Hop thugsta, so quick to rush ya 
 Straight to the dirt, fool I do work 
 Nobody move, nobody get hurt 
 That's how it is when it come to me 
 'Cause I'm the long dick bust-a-nut nigga named Eazy 
 Bitches can't see me, hos say I'm crazy 
 But I don't think so, 'cause I'm just loco 
 I gives a fuck about a skanless bitch 
 Let me hit it one time if you suck this dick 
 I don't trip, gives my dough to no ho 
 That's how it is, but I gives love to ya 
 If you got love for them gangstas 
 Let me hear you one time if you down for the crime (that's right fool) 
 If you got love for them hustlas 
 Let me hear you say hoo if you makin' straight dough (hoo!) 
 If you got love for them playas 
 Let me hear you say ooh, ladies we want you (ooh!) 
 If you got love for them straight g's 
 Let me hear you motherfuckers just scream (heeeeeeey!) (x2)
