Gimmie this, gimmie that, gimmie this, gimmie that 
 Bitch, step back and don't try to jack 
 "But mister dopeman, dopeman, can I get a hit?" 
 No, hoe but you can get my duck sick... 
 But let me finish my story as I was sayin' 
 I told you lil locs ain't playin' 
 Gotta roll with the bunches 
 Can't help the travellin' bunches 
 Now ain't that somethin' 
 Just a case a few niggaz try to trip 
 Bone-out, put on my skimask 
 And come back blastin' 
 Cause niggaz my height don't fight 
 My name is Eazy-E 
 You're mothafuckin' right 
 They must to thought I was a busta 
 Wearin' your bullet-proof vest 
 So what's next? 
 I got my nine fitted up with deadline 
 And don't let me hit the wetbomb 
 So watcha wanna do? 
 The red, white and blue, I got some for you too 
 Cause it gonna be on when I'm kickin' down my dough 
 So say hello to my new 44... 
 I'm a type of nigga... 
 That smokes mothafuckaz... 
 That smokes mothafuckaz... 
 I don't give a fuck fuck... 
 Smoke mothafuckaz... 
 I'ma smoke mothafuckaz... 
 'Cause I'm the "E" 
 So you can kiss my black ass 
 Fuck the white house, it ain't my house 
 So you can burn the mothafucka down for all I care 
 Cause t-shirts and khakies is all I wear 
 I'm from the city where they show no pitty 
 For a punk ass mark in the park 
 Blow his brains out, stuck him in the bushes 
 Take his gat, leave his ass for the rats 
 And let me hit that cisco, I got a 187 on my pistol 
 Warrant by the LAPD 
 Key for puttin' in work out my trade 
 Because the president never simp 
 One dumb dog to my residents 
 I'm goin' crazy like 1980 
 I need my ends, fuck you, pay me 
 Or I'ma have to get the strap 
 My nutty O.G. buddy Big Black 
 I make you shit in your pants 
 And shake like jelly 
 So tell off my homie said hello... 
 I'm a type of nigga... 
 That smoke mothafuckaz... 
 That smoke mothafuckaz... 
 I don't give a fuck... 
 Smoke mothafuckaz... 
 Smoke mothafuckaz... 
 Like it ain't no thang... 
 You can't check a checker 
 But when you wanna try let me know 
 I got the strecher on stand-by 
 Starvin' for a nigga like you 
 The things is much bigger 
 Than the trigger 
 So I can show how to put in work: 
 The Ruthless-network drive-by experts 
 Straight outta compton kickin' up dust 
 The place where guns don't get a change to rust 
 I warned them and they still approached me 
 Now I got two more golf-hats for my trophy 
 I got a brand new trend, it's killin' men 
 Who is that? That's my little friend... 
 I don't give a fuck... 
 I don't give a fuck... 
 I don't give a fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck... 
 I don't give a fuck... 
 I don't give a fuck... 
 Smoke mothafuckaz... 
 Like it ain't no thang...
