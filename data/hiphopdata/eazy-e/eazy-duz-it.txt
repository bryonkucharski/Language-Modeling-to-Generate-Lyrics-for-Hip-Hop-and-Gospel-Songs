(Little Girl's voice:) 
 He was once a thug from around the way 
 Easy! But you should... 
 (Eazy E interrupts:) 
 Bitch shut the fuck up! Get the fuck out of here! Yo Dre 
 (Dr. Dre:) 
 "What's up?" 
 (Eazy E:) 
 Give me a funky ass bass line 
 What the fuck is up? 
 In the place to be 
 Comin' on the mic is Eazy muthafuckin' E 
 Dre is on the beat 
 Yella's on the cut 
 So listen right close while we rip shit up 
 (Eazy E:) 
 Well I'm Eazy E, I got bitches galore 
 You may have a lot of bitches but I got much more 
 Wit my super duper group comin' out to shoot 
 Eazy E, muthafuckers cold knockin' the boots 
 'Cause I'm a hip-hop thugster, I used to be a mugster 
 If you heard Compton, you think I own a drugstore 
 Gettin' stupid because I know how 
 And if a fucker talks shit, I give him a... (POW) 
 8 Ball sippin' the bitches are flippin' 
 Slow down, I hit a dippin' continue my trippin' 
 Hittin' my switches, collect from my bitches 
 The money that I make so I can add to my riches 
 Fill my stash box and start rubbing my gat 
 Feelin' good as hell because my pockets are fat 
 A hardcore villain cold roaming the streets 
 And wit a homey like Dre just supplying the beats 
 Because I'm a gangsta havin' fun 
 Never leave the pad without packin' a gun 
 Hittin' hard as fuck, I make you ask what was it 
 Boy you should have known by now, Eazy Duz It 
 I was knocking muthafukers out 
 What's your name boy 
 Funky, fresh Eazy E 
 Kick, kick that shit 
 Where you from fool? Compton, yeah 
 Rolling through the hood, cold tearin' shit up 
 Stick my head out the window & I say what's up 
 To the niggas on the corner cold bumpin' the box 
 But you know that's an alibi for slangin' the rocks 
 A dice game started so I said what the fuck 
 So I put my shit in park and had to try my luck 
 Hard to roll wit my bitch jockin' 24-7 
 Rolled them muthafukers ate 'em up, hit 11 
 Got another point, I made a 10 a fo' 
 Was takin' niggas money and was itchin' for mo' 
 Laughin' in their faces and said your all making me rich 
 Then one punk got jealous, cold slap my bitch 
 He pulled out his gat, I knew he wouldn't last 
 So I said to myself, homeboy, you better think fast 
 He shot (gunshots), I shot (gunshots) 
 As you can see, I cold broke his ass 
 Because I'm a gangsta havin' fun 
 Never leave the pad without packin' a gun 
 Hittin' hard as fuck, I make you ask what was it 
 Boy you should have known by now, Eazy Duz It 
 Wait a minute, wait a minute, who does it? 
 Muthafuckin' Eazy Duz It 
 But how does he do it? 
 Eazy Duz It do it eazy 
 That's what I'm doin' 
 Stop 
 Man whatcha gonna do now 
 Now I'm a break it down just to tell a little story 
 Straight out the box from the gangsta category 
 About a sucker, a sucker muthafucker 
 He's addicted, he's a smoker but in Compton called a clucker 
 He used to have a house car and golden rings 
 But the cooky cooky crack took all those things 
 He must of been starvin' 'cause he broke in my house 
 Caught the nigga on the street and straight took his ass out 
 Now I wanted for a murder that I had to commit 
 Yeah I went to jail but that wasn't shit 
 Got to the station about a quarter of 9 
 Call my bitch to get me out 'cause I was down for mine 
 The bitch was a trip cold hung up the phone 
 Now my only phone call was in the gankin' zone 
 All the things I did for her like keepin' her rich 
 I swear when I get out, I'm gonna kill the bitch 
 Well by now you should know it was just my luck 
 The baliff of the station was a neighborhood cluck 
 I looked him straight in the eye and said what's up 
 And said let's make a deal, you know I'll do you up 
 Now back on the streets and my records are clean 
 I creeped on my bitch wit my uzi machine 
 Went to the house and kicked down the do' 
 Unloaded like hell, cold smoked the hoe 
 Because I'm a gangsta havin' fun 
 Never leave the pad without packin' a gun 
 Hittin' hard as fuck, I make you ask what was it 
 Boy you should have known by now, Eazy Duz It 
 From around the way, born in '73 
 Harcore B-boy named Eazy E 
 It's '88 now, '73's obselete 
 A nigga wit a serious ass attitude and 100% street 
 And if you all wanna hear some more 
 In one way or the other, I'm a bad brother 
 Word to the muthafucker
