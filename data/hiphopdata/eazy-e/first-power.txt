"I am the resurrection and the life 
 He who believes in me, though he dies, yet shall relive and whoever lives and believes in me shall never die... 
 "Shut up, bitch" 
 Fear not them which kill the body, rather fear Him which is able to destroy both body and soul in Hell 
 Get thee behind me Satan and push me along" 
 "All this power I will give thee, if thou therefore wilt worship me 
 All shall be thine..." 
 "Come with me bitch as we go through the door, backwards 
 Heaven in art which Father our, Our Father which art in Heaven..."Hey muthafucker" 
 See you 'round, buddy boy"
