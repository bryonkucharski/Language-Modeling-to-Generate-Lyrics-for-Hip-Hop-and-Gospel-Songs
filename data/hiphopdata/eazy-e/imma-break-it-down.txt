(Eazy-E) 
 My eternal jam is the juice of the radio 
 Takin' out profanity so they can play it though 
 Listen to a hell of a kick and the high hat 
 Going to the record store say ya gonna buy 
 That the E is connected to the A and the Z ya say Y 
 So that's how the beats stack it up on material made of hits 
 Takin' my time of each line to make sure it fits 
 Push play on the instrumental that's recorded 
 Step on stage and I'm suddenly awarded 
 Some sort of track appeared like a plaque 
 And some hell of a scream from the girls in the back 
 Takin' a bow 'cause I got style 
 Never at the bottom of the ways on the top of the pile 
 Yo it's Eazy on top even though I'm short 
 Guarenteed to help when I walk on the court 
 So get up make some noise for the gangsta clap 
 Gonna tip the laugh I'm not a pranksta 
 I'm serious Dre my sounds so quit playin' around 
 'Cause I'mma break it down 
 (Eazy-E) 
 Last time I was takin' my time with this 
 But other suckaz were makin' a rhyme with this 
 I had to change the tip or make it hyper 
 But they was rotten, I was gettin' riper 
 Ready to go, like never before 
 Givin' you more because I'm ready to score 
 Ren is my buddy you can tell I said often 
 Helpin' me destroy the suckaz that's softin' 
 Curin' diseases, my rhyme pleases, throw it a key 
 Balls havin' seasons, this is a doctrine 
 And I'm locked in, and I made up my mind 
 And I think I'm gonna rock then 
 You got beaches chill and I'mma push ya 
 To freeze after I'll cut ya 'cause I'mma butcher 
 And say ya have pricin' and then out ya go 
 Cause a percentage on point bellys are very low 
 Messin' with a gun but once ya get hurt 
 Like a said before ya get rubbed in the dirt 
 I'm not a law man, but I'mma raw man 
 M.C. Ren: "But ya the dopest one I ever saw!" 
 I keep droppin' it pound for pound 
 And when I'm on the mic I always throw down 
 To keep y'all dancin' to my funky sound 
 So listen 'cause I'mma break it down 
 (Eazy-E) 
 Now look at me and not the poster 
 And you could see right off I got the most of 
 The talent, experience or a trade 
 And complements for the rhyme that's made 
 Talks over today if this one so 
 Pick another artist and dis one 
 I got the ballet of the chosen vote 
 'Cause I don't need water to clear my throat 
 Comin' from the rain the show is like dancin' 
 Nasty like and the girls are like glancin' 
 Wantin' to get wit me this routine 
 Keepin' it sprung still stayin' mean 
 Can ya dis this man I don't think so 
 Once I start writin' the way I let the ink go 
 Comin' out with songs like hit after hit 
 Cause this is legit and yours ain't shit 
 Makin' it sound so dope 'cause I'm a genius 
 But your amazed with ya happy to see this 
 Brother go crazy on wax 
 Flowin' away like if I was on a sax 
 Doin' a solo in the shade I'm a spotlight 
 Relax and chill while your up tight 
 Pumpin' up the funky sounds 
 Yo you should know it's kinda persist 
 That the E is gonna break it down
