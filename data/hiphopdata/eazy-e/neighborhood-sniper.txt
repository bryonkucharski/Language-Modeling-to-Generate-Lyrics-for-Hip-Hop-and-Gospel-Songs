(Eazy-E) 
 First up high on a roof top 
 Like a bird I'm havin' evil thoughts 
 A black hood covers my face 
 And death flows through my mind at it's own pace 
 Sometimes I feel like a super hero 
 Urgin' to free my kind 
 I'm so accurate 
 I shoot ya heart with a dime 
 Now I'm back to the moral of my tale 
 I see a victim, and then my thoughts fail 
 My minds still fumblin' with the present slavery 
 I'm here to save you but who's to save me 
 I hold my strap so long that my palms all wet 
 I put finger on the fit and then the side a check 
 I make the kill here's the deal 
 After the trigger's pulled then the death is sealed 
 So it's the shots that sing out like a piper 
 Everyone's scared I'm the neighborhood sniper 
 (Eazy-E) 
 So my boy is a snitch 
 I put my gun up to his head 
 And simply scared the bitch boo 
 Being the E ya know I'm thinkin' devious thoughts 
 Take off ya clothes nigga and here comes a plot 
 His bitch was scared she made a move I pulled the trigger 
 Now the room is red 
 Now there's nothing left but a snitch 
 Here's a four leaf clover punk make a wish 
 One (*Shot*) two (*Shot*) three strikes your out 
 This nigga is dead and now I'm lookin' for a window 
 I made my escape the cops chase 
 Duckin' to an alley so they don't recognize my face 
 The boy had to pay the piper 
 So they all stayin' fair of a neighborhood sniper 
 (Eazy-E) 
 I'm Doin' dirt as I continue my mission 
 Killin' all fools as an addiction 
 As a E lovin' the game leavin' a shame 
 And in my heart I feel no muthafuckin' pain 
 Because my heart is cold as I was told 
 And my A.K.47 I stand bold 
 Rippin' up shit with the fury of my gun shot 
 Pop pop pow as I watch the muthafucka drop 
 Lovin' the site as the blood spill 
 Take a photograph, to keep in my hard as I was sayin' calm 
 And never hyper as I succeed in my mission 
 I be a neighborhood sniper
