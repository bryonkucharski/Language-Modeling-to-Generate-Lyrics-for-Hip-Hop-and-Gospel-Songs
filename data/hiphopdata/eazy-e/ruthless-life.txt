The saga continues right before your eyes 
 The saga continues cause its do or die 
 The saga continues right before your eyes 
 You know why? (why?) 
 'Cause I'm ruthless for life 
 Nigga ten years passed and we still up in that ass 
 Will I make it or continue and 
 Look at all the shit you in 
 Eazy does it like happy like the shit we used to do 
 5 niggaz comin' out the C-P-T so fuck you 
 Time changed for the good 
 Niggaz in the hood be comin' up feel it 
 Can you set it off, for again, you know you should 
 Yo let's that this shit back 
 To 1989 
 Where this nigga shoot and bust and niggaz know they couldn't find 
 Dream Team lovers 
 Egyptian fan base 
 Feelin' on the scene, all the fools got erased 
 Threw a mothafuckin' monkey wrench up in the rap game 
 Since I hooked up with E, shit ain't ever been the same 
 Opened up doors for the niggaz that be thinkin' 
 That your flows be on tizight 
 Bitin' what I wrizite 
 Jokin' when I recite 
 Feelin' manuscripts 
 When I MC, if it ain't rough it ain't me 
 Yo mothafuckin' G'z, nigga like Eric Wright 
 You can floss for your b***h, but you know this shit is tight 
 'Cause when y'all niggaz started rappin', who'd you try and be? 
 I'ma slap you cause you lying, if you don't be sayin' me 
 Or the other 3, that the FBI be phone tappin' 
 Shoot the government before you niggaz started rappin' 
 Now its ? city, I gotta bomb it like Iraq 
 Use my alias, spend my nights at the shack 
 Ruthless attack all the way to two thou 
 Try to block it out, but you never knew how 
 And when I walk through the crowd 
 I'm seeing mothafucka's bread 
 I hear their b***hes sayin' ask MC Ren 
 Makin' fools sway when I roll to King Tet's 
 Because I started cussin' all you fools gettin' checks 
 Ruthless for life, see that be my state of mind 
 Y'all can kiss my black ass one more time 
 I run a hundred miles just so I can MC 
 Villian want that bomb so I get with L.T. 
 Ain't nothin' changed 
 We find 'em, fuck 'em, then flee 
 While you hatin', pillow talkin', with that b***h, she want me 
 Niggaz weed crazy, Dre and Snoop turned you out 
 Now y'all cristal sippin', y'all niggaz be trippin' 
 Make the West look like ass, all full of shit 
 Invest in drug money, shit, still gettin' in 
 What it take for y'all quit 
 Ruthless got it on lock 
 Y'all shootin' videos tryin' to look like Pac 
 Here we come, here we come, blowin' up your spot 
 My little brother Jubee and the big homie Rock 
 Full circle, all this shit gon' repeat 
 When this shit drop, niggaz clownin' in the streets 
 The saga continues right before your eyes 
 Who really gives a fuck? 
 Cause this is ruthless for life 
 Chorus till end
