 About a nigga in the wrong territory

 He made a right turn down the wrong street 
 Now whatta whatta whatta whatta pitty 
 A new jack in my muthafuckin' city

 They say it's niggaz pimpin' 
 Gangsta limpin'

 But back back to the nitty gritty 
 Bout this nigga slippin' in my fuckin' city 
 By the time that he realized that he fucked up 
 The stupid muthafucka got a foot in his ass 
 Now this is how the story goes 
 Don't you ever bring your ass 
 In my neiborhood fuckin' my hoes 
 'Cause they my hoes and I knows 
 When they've been fucked 
 "Who's ready to get up and do my thang!" 
 "Doin' it you know!"

 And tell how this kid went from right to riches 
 Now he's drivin' fancy cars gettin' bitches galore 
 He was a dirty little boy that I knew next door

 He got all this and that and he got 
 All these bitches callin' him Big Daddy 
 Ain't that a bitch how this muthafucka

 And this bastard is use to wear platform 
 Shoes plad pants and nappy ass hat under 
 A fucked up hat now lets kick the story 
 About that 
 (Eazy-E) 
 When the sun falls 
 And the shit falls down 
 So when people start comin' around 
 Knockin' at the door sayin' we want more 
 And moms wonderin' what the fuck they here for 
 Rock cocaine yeah just as I figured 
 But he can do that 'cause he's that nigga 
 From Eazy Street on the road to riches 
 Money, cars, houses, and hoes that's how the 
 Story goes and if the nigga stays up you 
 Know he can't be beat all this shit happens 
 On Eazy Street
