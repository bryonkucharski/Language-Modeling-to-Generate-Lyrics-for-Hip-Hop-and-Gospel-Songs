Straight off tha streets of muthafuckin mangere 
 It's the downest aucklander I know 
 Earfskee muthafuckin me 
 Bout to kick your ass in Ninety-Three 
 I creep and I crawl and I creep and I crawl 
 And I creep and I crawl CREEP CREEP 
 I said I creep and I crawl and I creep and I crawl 
 And I creep and I crawl CREEP CREEP 
 I got my niggas from Gravestreet WATTS 
 I got my niggas from the CPT 
 I got my niggas all across the motherfuckin land 
 That's down with the E-A-Z-Y E 
 Now, early in the mornin I awake 
 Thinkin' about these dead fool's life that I had to take 
 Frontin on a true name I peep game at point blank range 
 Fuck 'em 
 (Muthafuckin right y'all) 
 Back to the set as I jet 
 Not givin' a fuck about the nigga that I went 
 That's what he gotta shout for actin' like a trick 
 Now he's 6 feet and I'm deep in his bitch 
 Creepin' creepin' creepin' on the marks that be sleepin' 
 Catch you slippin slap the clip in buck 'em every weekend 
 A scandalous lil' nigga with the heart to feel remorse 
 Dick the niggas corps leave it on his momma's porch 
 Don't give a fuck about shit that's why I mellow 
 Or maybe it's the fact that I'm kin to the devil 
 A psychopathic nigga that's always quick to fill a 
 Nigga full of lead 'cause I'm a muthafuckin killer 
 Thriller from Manilla though I'm shown as the average 
 Try to test your luck and get bucked by a muthafuckin savage 
 I creep and I crawl and I creep and I crawl 
 And I creep and I crawl CREEP CREEP 
 I said I creep and I crawl and I creep and I crawl 
 And I creep and I crawl CREEP CREEP 
 I got my niggas from Gravestreet WATTS 
 I got my niggas from the CPT 
 I got my niggas all across the muthafuckin land 
 That's down with the E-A-Z-Y E 
 Now, later on that night as I'm rollin' 
 Lookin' for a nigga I can Gat and pack a hole in 
 Stoppin' at a light on the latenight 
 Fire up a Phillie Blunt to get my head right 
 See some niggas slippin at a burger stand 
 And in my mind all I'm thinkin' is a murder plan 
 Creepin' through the drive through kinda slow 
 I got my hot beams on the back of the .4 
 Yo, smokin' on chronic with the rag down 
 Not knowin' I'm about to lay their ass down 
 Reach for them fools make my move 
 Leaned out my jeep and I creep kinda smooth 
 With the Gat to the nigga's dome now he's sleeps 
 One shot to the top body flopped on the seat 
 Peep, I dumped on the lil' skinny passenger 
 A bitch is screamin in a rage so I blasted her 
 Smashed and I got about 5 blocks 
 Before I got stopped by punk ass cops 
 (Shit, fuck 'em) 
 Fuck you 
 * Shots rang out * 
 Muthafucka 
 Hahaha
