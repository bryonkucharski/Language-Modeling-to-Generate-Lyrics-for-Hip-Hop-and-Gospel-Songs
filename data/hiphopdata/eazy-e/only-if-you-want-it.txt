Only if you want it 
 Yes I really want it 
 Only if you want it 
 Yes I really want it 
 Only if you want it 
 Yes I really want it 
 Only if you want it 
 Yes I really want it 
 (Eazy-E) 
 Can I get an eye open up 
 Eazy locin' up 
 Smokin' up 
 Much dust like a nut what 
 Give it up for the real stuff 
 Shut the what up 
 Back the shut up what 
 Hustler from the hood hoe 
 Hopin' and mud rub 
 The finishin' touches 
 Will show what rough is 
 Comin' in bunches 
 Get served like lunches 
 Hold ya horses, here's where the source is 
 Not very tall, but never took a short kit 
 With a clip to claw 
 Quick Draw McGraw 
 I trick a law before all and all I'm raw 
 A naughty shorty, sporty with a forty 
 A laddy takin' tours, just to plan an orgy 
 A nasty critter, any hoe hitter 
 Hated my babysitter 'cause she wouldn't let me hit her 
 Now get up on it, on and on get on it 
 And I will pump it, only if you want it 
 Only if you want it 
 Yes I really want it 
 Only if you want it 
 Yes I really want it 
 Only if you want it 
 Yes I really want it 
 Only if you want it 
 Yes I really want it

 Here's something from the ding dong cause 
 I really care how long ya been strong grown 
 Here comes the switch dome chrome 
 Couldn't hang with the king 
 Out the rudder but I call for a yes y'all toots 
 My style is just as fresh as a dusch bush 
 I face ya fact throw a heck just like woody wooder 
 And if I left that means I should of booger 
 Here's a new track, for all the jacks 
 I'm kickin' it the hardest so gimmie my shoes back 
 So I live when I step it's the pimp 
 And I rep so make a right and get left quick 
 So try to play strong and long gone 
 The flow is kinda funky but far from Armstrong 
 Get up on it, on and on get on it 
 And I will pump it, only if you want it 
 Only if you want it 
 Yes I really want it 
 Only if you want it 
 Yes I really want it 
 Only if you want it 
 Yes I really want it 
 Only if you want it 
 Yes I really want it 
 (Treach) 
 Ooh a new jack! a new jack 
 (Eazy-E) 
 Kid I swear I saw a puddy cat 
 Back back smack, here comes a witty black 
 Endin' in a skull high I'm bout to show why 
 Eazy's fillin' caps cause my gat's in the low ride 
 Bang when the gat sneaks, two in the back seat 
 My homie rides shotgun waitin' to spot one 
 Duh is a fool who don't ride to slide to a ride 
 I'm shudder shakin' the place when I start hey 
 So don't butter, Eazy-E but a park hey 
 The only thing to flow these now to be fly is a feather 
 I see the smilin' faces of while they sick 
 Ya know me better, hard Rodney kid 
 Gettin' Cali kid, now ya know it boy 
 Left up in the alley dead 
 Now get up on it, on and on get on it 
 And I will pump it, only if you want it 
 Only if you want it 
 Yes I really want it 
 Only if you want it 
 Yes I really want it 
 Only if you want it 
 Yes I really want it 
 Only if you want it 
 Yes I really want it
