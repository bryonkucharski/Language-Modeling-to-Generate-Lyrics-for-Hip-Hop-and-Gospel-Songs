Yo man I don't think they heard you 
 Why don't you tell 'em what ya name is. 
 My name is Eazy yeah this is true 
 Keepin' your attention is what I'm gonna do 
 Hardcore yo I could never be soft 
 Askin' them my defin' they say the boy goes off 
 Fillin' up my memo with the touch of my rhyme 
 Suckaz stayin' with me cause yo they know the time 
 Quiet on the set because I'm about to begin 
 And if you didn't hear me boy I'll tell you again 
 My name is Eazy or just call me E 
 But It doesn't really matter to me 
 'Cause I'm the same person 
 Whether serious or rehearsin' 
 I just gotta keep cursin' 
 This is for the radio so I better chill 
 They won't play it if I co get ill 
 But I'm like that and that's an actual fact 
 Because the street is where my heart is at 
 Yo I don't do dope but I'm dope not a dope 
 But I'm doper than anybody who trys to cope 
 With the rhyme I'm dispayin' 
 And the beat that's playin' 
 Yo you could try all day 
 And you still won't match up with the Ruthless P.O.W. 
 Cause Eazy's doin' it Compton style 
 That's the city and you say you could get some 
 Yo it's Eazy-er Said Than Dunn. 
 Woo! 
 Woo! 
 Now it's easy for me to get my point across 
 So listen up close if ya don't ya might get lost 
 I'm not a role model or a Dr. Seuss yo I'm a gangsta 
 And I'm about to get stupid 
 I guess its time for the trama 
 With the E-A-Z-Y-E comma now that's drama 
 So pay attention by the way I must mention 
 I'm comin' off hard in the third demention 
 With the glare 
 But you don't need no glasses to stare 
 Just pop your tape in and it's just like your there 
 With the E on the gangsta tip 
 So if you think I'm a flip or slip don't even trip 
 'Cause I'm a destroyer 
 My homie Dre is a doctor not a lawyer 
 Dope MC employer on Ruthless and that's my label 
 To get the money, the women, and co bust the fat cable's 
 Boy, master rhymers of toys 
 I mean str8 while ya suckin' with the girls enjoy 
 You must be sick or ya lonely 
 How ya gonna diss me ya don't even know me 
 (Eazy - E: Yo Ren) 
 (M.C. Ren: What sup) 
 Get the gat show 'em where it's at 
 And that's just the sound 
 And next time I'm peelin ya cap 
 To let ya know where I'm comin' from 
 Eazy said it and it shall Be Dunn. 
 Woo! 
 Woo! 
 Creatin' dope jams is what part of the cycle 
 Eazy-er said than dunn yeah that's the title 
 Rubbin' the lady's only the fly ones ya know 
 (M.C. Ren: but what if she's ugly?) 
 Eazy come Eazy go 
 Don't ask to battle me home boy what's that 
 You wanna battle me boy ya better be strapped 
 'Cause where I'm from it ain't all about that playin' 
 (*Gun shots*) 
 Now that's what I'm sayin' 
 Sevy thought that I was born in '73 
 Now everybody want's to know the A-G-E 
 Girls on the tip fellaz too it seemed 
 Had everybody thinkin' I was only 15 
 The fellaz would annoy me 
 The ladyz would adore me 
 And what was I to do 
 I wish to let the ladys through 
 Cause the ladyz I luv 'em 
 Nice and then soft 
 I hate male groupies so just step the hell off 
 I'm the real Eazy cause others be fakin' 
 Tryin' to gain fame off the name I'm makin' 
 Sayin' on your records you could get some 
 Yo home boy its Eazy-er Said Than Dunn. 
 Woo! 
 Woo!
