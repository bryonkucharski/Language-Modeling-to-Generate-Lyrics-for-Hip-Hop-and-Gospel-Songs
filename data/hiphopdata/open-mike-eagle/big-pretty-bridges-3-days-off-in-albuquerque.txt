So long 
 So long now 
 I'm far away from my house, wrote this song in the hotel room 
 On a day of the show, got canceled, now this room feels like Bellevue 
 Jupiter's got twelve moons and there's life forms on a couple of them 
 Give a fuck if my plans fell through, if I'm deep purple or pale blue 
 So please circle the right answer on this questionnaire I'm gon' mail you 
 Haven't we yet made a real connection or is this simply a prelude? 
 What's this centuries Quaalude? What's the next millennium's molly pill? 
 And my body feels like sunlight, 'bout to run right through this poppy field 
 So my eyes burn and my nose run and my skin itches like fire 
 Only rappers with sinus troubles could ever enter my cypher 
 Every sentence that I write, my muse, feels like it could be tighter 
 There's a small chance that we can't connect 'cause we're too differently wired 
 So long 
 So long now 
 We'll dig, we'll still 
 Build big pretty bridges 
 We'll dig, we'll still 
 Build big pretty bridges 
 We'll dig, we'll still 
 Build big pretty bridges 
 What the fuck is you doing here? I done plugged up this computer gear 
 And I'm 'bout to sweat in this laptop, the drive here was like five years 
 I swear I only made one gas stop, I'm the Batman of the minivan 
 And my plan's choking these rap fans who think rap shows are like Disneyland 
 What the fuck is you doing here with no roller coasters, no souvenirs? 
 Sometimes the shit's second nature, other times it feels super weird 
 There's some faces here I done seen before, seen people dancing, seen people bored 
 Now I'm reaching out for your hand so you can understand what I'm speaking for 
 But don't sweep the floor, but don't wipe the bar 
 Leave them glasses right where they are 
 Look at me when I talk to you cause this not some shit I'm sleepwalking through 
 Not some shit that y'all can wipe away, a game some of y'all like to play 
 I'm dialing into you access and you this signal will not decay 
 So long 
 So long now 
 We'll dig, we'll still 
 Build big pretty bridges 
 We'll dig, we'll still 
 Build big pretty bridges 
 We'll dig, we'll still 
 Build big pretty bridges
