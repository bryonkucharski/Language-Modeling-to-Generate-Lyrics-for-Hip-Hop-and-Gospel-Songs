Whatever it's supposed to be 
 Do what it's supposed to do 
 Make you uncomfortable 
 Fuck Redding, California, cause shit's pretty racial there 
 I'm envious of anyone with full-grown facial hair 
 Yeah, I'm always in between haircuts 
 But FDR said it ain't shit to be scared of 
 Huh, he must have never smoked herb 
 Been beaten by his dad or heard bad spoken word 
 I got a pretty mean overbite 
 I'm still trying to navigate the settings on my Focusrite preamp 
 Condenser mic attached with a c-clamp 
 Weed on the patio, chiefing under the heat lamp 
 Yeah, or sneak in with a g-pen 
 And take that shit to church and stay high all weekend 
 Yeah, I'll fucking interrupt your telecast hella fast 
 From blonde wig and blue eyed Ellen mask 
 Watch me dance 
 Are you watching? 
 I'm cold 
 We should invest in inner-ear monitors 
 And start our own niche and gain little weird followers 
 Yeah, that make the flyest orthotics 
 And make decent movies out of Alan Moore comics 
 You can use Facebook to learn gang signs 
 And creepers can stalk all their exes at the same time 
 And if your rap career ain't hitting 
 You can rap over videos of kittens, it's the golden age! 
 Tell the internet how you got fucked over 
 And buy a minivan with seventeen cupholders 
 Legal opiates, having yourself a fever dream 
 And you can watch a video of the bible's deleted scenes 
 And nobody ever has to pay for anything 
 Which is pretty cool cause everybody's unemployed! 
 I changed my rap name to Lil' Wonder Boy 
 Change your rap name to Lil' Lord Fauntleroy 
 And we can rap about all the different candy bars 
 Try to get sponsors from Mounds and Almond Joy 
 And Whatchamacallit, and Nestle Crunch, and Kit Kat 
 And shit, Toblerone 
 And watch Twin Peaks on your mobile phone 
 And take a shot so you don't feel your broken bones 
 And move close to home 
 Or don't move out to begin with 
 Smoke herb for your gout and your shin splints 
 This new colorful weed is pretty intense 
 There's thin mints that you can get after you finish wind sprints 
 And I think that's it 
 But all that shit is great right? 
 That shit is cool!
