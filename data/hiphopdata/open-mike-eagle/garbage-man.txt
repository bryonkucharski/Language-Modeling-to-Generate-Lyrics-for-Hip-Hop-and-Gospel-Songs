(Don't even look at me) 
 I'm just a garbage man 
 Working in my garden 
 With heart in hand 
 Watching the harvest of Artistland 
 The new plants want the same thing 
 That stars demand 
 (Don't even look at us) 
 Abrasive as a carpet burn 
 Right before the key to your apartment turns 
 We take the needle off of Hard to Earn 
 And lock it up in its mason jar preserved 
 A 9.5 for the dismount 
 In the underground 
 My title is viscount 
 I got a trick up my sleeve 
 To rip up the scene 
 So give us the keys 
 'Cause we're entitled to this house 
 Shit outta luck 
 Cause your lease is up 
 Plus it's time to upgrade 
 Your speakers suck 
 Since the nineties 
 You cleaned them once 
 Since then the only thing we've seen is dust 
 Go on get your movie roles 
 But when you're going to the studio 
 (We see you) 
 While you're touring overseas 
 We're home looking through your groceries 
 (We see you) 
 Yeah I heard you holler weird rap 
 But what about your shit from years back 
 (We see you) 
 It's a tangible raw 
 That grabs you by your face 
 Like the mandible claw 
 (Don't even look at us) 
 Clothes washed with the best detergent 
 They're budgetarily blessed for certain 
 (Look at the catering) 
 The olive oil's extra virgin 
 I'm trying to keep quiet 
 But my flesh is burning 
 I think we deserve some food 
 Shit even the freaks in the circus do 
 They never greet us with a serving spoon 
 And that makes me want to cease to observe the rules 
 We can steal the sheep herding tools 
 Like jumping on stage and barking crap 
 Even more convincing in stocking caps 
 And shaped up goatees like Mark McGrath 
 In the teeny bop magazines 
 And represent a really hot rapper scene 
 I don't have to front 
 I know what I want 
 Me posing in front of a steaming hot DAT machine 
 Looking pretty in your makeup 
 But really shitty when you wake up 
 (We see you) 
 Wrote down everything you told your crew 
 'Cause it's what we're gonna hold you to 
 (We see you) 
 You cuff her like a girlfriend 
 But we know where your girl's been 
 (We see you) 
 Give us the things we demanded from y'all 
 Or we'll take it 
 Cause that's just the animal law 
 (Don't even look at me) 
 I'm just a garbage man 
 Walking down an alley 
 Shopping cart in hand 
 Rummaging apartment cans 
 Waiting for this mother ship of ours to land 
 (Don't even look at us) 
 God must've made us wrong 
 Just listen to the bullshit we say on songs 
 (Had some strong days) 
 But they all gone 
 We wasted 'em writing odes to Rae Dawn Chong 
 We use to hold crayons wrong 
 Until we got trained 
 To obey y'alls laws 
 But radio won't play our songs 
 So we rising on up 
 Like a rayon thong 
 Cause y'all played hundreds of duds 
 Beats that sound like plungers in mud 
 Put your ear to the ground 
 Hear the thunderous buzz 
 Art Rap parties 
 Crack under the club
