Ladies and Gents I have seen the future 
 And pretty soon you'll need a PhD to be an English tutor 
 You're gonna have to put your house up to lease a scooter 
 We still work but our bosses are now mean computers 
 They make the decisions on when our lunch break is given 
 On whether the printers need new ink, tape, or ribbons 
 You can't leave there's a brand new stapler missin' 
 No Panda Express for their cashew flavored chicken 
 We tell on each other for eight cent raises 
 And all the comedians make Dane Cook faces 
 And the rap has no lyrics just eight hooks pasted 
 And the newborn babies are given Facebook pages 
 Cause ever since birth we'll be prisoners in a meshwork 
 There's a war on terror but innocent people get hurt 
 So now Al Qaeda's a system of internet jerks 
 And Osama Bin Laden is in your extended network 
 I'm getting the hell up outta here via helicopter 
 If I have to I'll borrow Psycho's helicopter 
 I don't need an umbrella I need a helicopter 
 Cause everything here in the scene is getting hella awkward 
 So raise your hand if you wanna get on my helicopter 
 Gimme some energy if you wanna get on this helicopter 
 The only way up outta here is via helicopter 
 ('Cause if my premonition's right this is a demolition site) 
 We'll have our own paparazzi 
 So TMZ'll have its own link for all your toxic hobbies 
 And the paparazzi'll have their own paparazzi 
 So they'll be stalking each other up in their office lobbies 
 Hide in the back for interviews creepin' 
 To see what dinner you eatin' with Kick-A-Poo seasonin' 
 It used to be they could have it up in a few evenings 
 Now you Google yourself to find a pic of you sleeping 
 Brittney wins the 20 and 12 election 
 The Green Party candidate was a worker for Exxon 
 Christians promotin' for Jesus' resurrection 
 On a keyboard attached to the toilet for them to text on 
 Every one of us is living in its reach 
 Cause unregistered citizens are a menace in the streets 
 And each one of your children is on an independent leash 
 And you'll have to have a login to visit Venice Beach 
 But not me 'cause I'm saving to buy a helicopter 
 That way I never have to borrow somebody's helicopter 
 So raise your hands if you wanna get on my helicopter 
 I got a big fat time-traveling helicopter 
 And I'm going to the moon
