It's the return of the curmudgeon 
 We're all thirty-first cousins 
 Remind myself, cause the thirst doesn't 
 The thirst kills 
 Thirst murders universal will 
 I'll be having to tell myself chill 
 That's just my ego talking 
 Thinks he's super hero awesome 
 Big chief, captain, president, and chairman over everything 
 That's just my ego talking 
 Thinks he's super hero awesome 
 Big chief, captain, president, and chairman over everything 
 My man Dave Gahan is in Depeche Mode 
 Used to have a crush on Michel'le from Death Row 
 This business is pop charts and who gets the top part 
 I still be wanting to mention Calista Flockhart 
 Yeah, and Jonathan Lipnicki 
 Madonna there's room on the ottoman sit with me 
 Bring me coconut water to swallow with this whiskey 
 And let's talk about the nautilus positive shit gets me 
 This is my emotional ape face 
 I'm president of the rappers that don't condone date rape 
 I should eat rice cakes and drink water fools 
 And learn to do yoga and vibrate my molecules 
 It's harder than finding coal in a seafloor 
 Or feeding poor people through the hole in a screen door 
 Shout out to first dude who pissed in the wind before 
 And went in the woods despite the myth of Wendigo 
 I really wanna dress like Sun Ra 
 A mumran and dumb broad stalking the jungles of Punjab 
 My nickname is Lord Bravery 
 On voice memos that I tape record lazily 
 They be hatin' his brain 
 'Cause they move with dumb words like ancient doorways can be 
 And thoughts that I'm great can pour limitless 
 I'm pretty sure I self deprecate for your benefit 
 It's the return of the curmudgeon 
 We're all thirty-first cousins 
 Remind myself, cause the thirst doesn't 
 The thirst kills 
 Thirst murders universal will 
 I'll be having to tell myself chill 
 That's just my ego talking 
 Thinks he's super hero awesome 
 Big chief, captain, president, and chairman over everything 
 That's just my ego talking 
 Thinks he's super hero awesome 
 Big chief, captain, president, and chairman over everything 
 Trying not to have missteps in my catalog 
 Like Scott Hall burning Goldberg with a cattle prod 
 Analog Eagle, Joe Walsh bandanna on 
 Tag along here Dear, next stop Babylon 
 We can yell "Eye of the tiger" if he sees gazelle
