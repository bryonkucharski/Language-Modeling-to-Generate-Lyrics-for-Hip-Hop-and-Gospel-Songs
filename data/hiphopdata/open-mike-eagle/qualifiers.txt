I see the deepest greens 
 I hear the darkest blues 
 Might not be synesthesia 
 Might be apartment fumes 
 G-g-get up and dance 
 G-g-get up and dance 
 I w-w-wipe my son's ass 
 And get shit on my hands 
 He'd get in my car and be like 
 "Daddy play some Busdriver" 
 Why the fuck's it take two lines to do a one liner 
 And why's it take three beats to do a two-step 
 Sick days, I got two left 
 So I take five, Dave Brubeck 
 I make jazz jokes so I'm flat broke 
 Mad at LOST and that black smoke 
 Fuck you if you're a white man that assumes I speak for black folks 
 Fuck you if you're a white man who thinks I can't speak for black folk 
 Let that soak in your rap quotes 
 And your head hurt, and your back broke 
 I'm half crack smoke and half black soap 
 I admit that it's an imperfect blend 
 Hold up it's my turn again 
 I'm playing thirteen games of Words With Friends 
 Lift your hands 
 Lift your head if your clothes are clean and your kids are fed 
 Mine's potty trained, so when he pisses the bed 
 Then he can tell I'm heated like infrared, yeah 
 We're the best, mostly 
 Sometimes the freshest rhymers 
 We the tightest kinda 
 Respect my qualifiers 
 We're the best, mostly 
 Sometimes the freshest rhymers 
 We the tightest kinda 
 Respect my qualifiers 
 They say they're looking for me, but I don't wanna hear it 
 You can find me in the park district, volunteering 
 With my hair disheveled, and my sneakers scuffed 
 Or use your gps and get your celly features up 
 I went to Africa, they played me on the radio 
 And did I weird the people out, yeah, maybe so 
 Cause all they knew was jive 
 And all I do is vibe 
 And 'Bright Green Light' made the program director lose his mind 
 He said "What type of rap is that? Ain't no bitches, hoes" 
 And I ain't even being funny, homie didn't know 
 Shoulda said it's whimsical 
 Like Serengeti taught me 
 My thoughts are very lofty 
 Response time is very faulty 
 I'm far too young to lead 
 And way to old to die 
 I ain't played Call of Duty, smoke you in Golden Eye 
 RPG, roll the die

 We're the best, mostly 
 Sometimes the freshest rhymers 
 We the tightest kinda 
 Respect my qualifiers 
 We're the best, mostly 
 Sometimes the freshest rhymers 
 We the tightest kinda 
 Respect my qualifiers 
 I didn't write the words you hear me singing 
 I didn't sing a line before this one 
 And you are not the one I was addressing 
 That person took a train to Africa 
 And simultaneous events don't happen 
 We are isolated temporally 
 And the part is never called the whole thing 
 Though it bothers us to know it so
