Dark comedy cold as the ocean 
 Ad a l0l cause nobody seems to know when I'm joking 
 For those who haven't heard of me 
 I'm bad at sarcasm so I work in absurdity 
 On that laugh to keep from crying tip 
 Rap like Wyatt vs Chet in Weird Science 
 Cause my genre's all hack 
 Actions cliche, melodrama falls flat 
 And everybody's getting fired 
 I flew off the handle, and boy are my arms tired 
 Rap songs like Patch Adams 
 Shadyac thought of it as art till they laughed at it 
 Rap songs like Steven Wright 
 Monotone drone, people wonder if he breathing right 
 We got that dark dark comedy 
 That dark d-dark dark dark d-dark comedy 
 Cause rappers ruin the punchline 
 Like stand up club hecklers doing the punchline 
 'Cause I'll tweet on Sunday morning like a preacher at a church 
 Because my true religion is the thirst 
 It's like Burn After Reading 
 The dark ugly truth that addicts learn at the meetings 
 Sean already wrote about the modern man 
 The only other option is the plight of the hologram 
 It's dark comedy, I would've called it black 
 If another dude calls me a racist, I'mma snap 
 Cause Google knows what's in my cabinet 
 And Facebook logs all of my favorite sandwiches 
 And what they need the damn data for 
 To analyze the shit they'd need a whole 'nother labor force 
 'Cause I'm addicted to my celly 
 And I gotta have some coffee in my belly, ya smell me 
 There's mad shootings on the news 
 Unless it's in the Chi, cause blacks and mexicans can die 
 I swear we live in John Lennon songs 
 Matching track suit like dude in Royal Tenenbaums 
 It's like the In Living Color cast 
 We'd laughing trying not to wish death on the upper class 
 I'd like to run up on the Koch Brothers 
 And beat 'em with a garden hose made of old rubber 
 Give 'em rock bottoms and a cold stone stunner 
 Drop some cold butter on 'em from the skyscraper 
 Pistol whip 'em with the handle of a lightsaber 
 Cut 'em with rice paper, chuckle like a wiseacre 
 Instead think of something sarcastic, black 
 My man Nocan knows what I'm laughing at 
 My man Busdriver knows what I'm laughing at 
 My man Milo knows what I'm laughing at
