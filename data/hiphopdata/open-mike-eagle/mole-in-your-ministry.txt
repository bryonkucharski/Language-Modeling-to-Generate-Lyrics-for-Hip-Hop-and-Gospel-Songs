I had a nightmare of Tony Blair 
 I had a dream I cracked him in the head with a folding chair 
 I had the people just hold him there 
 And bashed his dome until blood splashed his golden hair 
 I drew his ass a mustache with a Sharpie marker 
 And cut his head like an artsy barber 
 I set it off in the House of Commons 
 I'm a party starter 
 Starting political parties for wheat and barley farmers 
 Voting in secret ballots for whole leaf or Caesar salad 
 Should I have roast beef or vegan sandwich? 
 Will I get cold feet or meet the challenge 
 Is the Obelisk a secret phallus? 
 Circle yes or no 
 Squeeze the juice from a purple vegetable 
 Then bring it to the first Congressional hearing 
 That you can find 
 Mix in their wine and start smearing 
 All over their faces like 
 "Taste this you rapist 
 Take it like the bribes 
 From the dudes you gave favors" 
 You've had the whole world in a chokehold mentally 
 I listen to far too much NPR 
 In my scarred up empty car 
 So large trucks near me start hard-bumping Diddy 
 I'm creating an all star funk committee 
 Made of chart-chomping ninnies 
 That make hard county ditties 
 Let's us do-see-do 
 (Poor broke and lonely ho) 
 Before they sell us polio contaminated Oreos 
 Sometimes I don't agree with rap 
 (Why?) 
 Cause most of it reinforces social achievement gaps 
 I gotta get brainy 
 'Cause I'm a politic hating scholarship trainee 
 Sometimes when people speak we will silence it 
 Their skill level doesn't meet the requirements 
 I killed devils underneath the environment 
 Even though I don't believe in your fire pits 
 I'm sharp enough to make your tires split 
 Sharp as a choir's pitch 
 My enlightened heart don't desire shit 
 You've had the whole world in a chokehold mentally 
 (You'll be letting it go) 
 'Cause I'm the mole in your ministry 
 I heard of the dark arts and underground chemistry 
 (I'm letting the globe know) 
 'Cause I'm the mole in your ministry 
 Take the cross from the rose 
 And there's no more energy 
 (It's set to explode) 
 'Cause I'm the mole in your ministry 
 I've been to the rainbow 
 The fake gold tempted me 
 (The mystery's age old) 
 'Cause I'm the mole in your ministry 
 Pay no attention to the orbs that flew in a formation 
 Your flow will get cancelled due to your poor ratings 
 Your rappin' makes 'em continue to ruin poor nations 
 Because of you there's more rapings in Ecuador 
 Escape from you is what children think that the meth is for 
 You're what they get billions for building secret weapons for 
 You are the enemy 
 You're why they bombard the infantry 
 Of nations who populations are base and retarded mentally 
 And they can say that because of who? 
 (You) 
 You're also the reason they came back with "W" 
 (Twice) 
 Because of you it's war on the populace 
 And the logo's a sword and an obelisk 
 The same ones you adorned on your monuments 
 Not an inordinate moderate 
 They're more of the opposite 
 With little more than the pocket-lint between us 
 Me and my homies are building a rocket ship to Venus 
 Before the sick apocalypse hit it's zenith 
 You've had the whole world in a chokehold mentally 
 (You'll be letting it go) 
 'Cause I'm the mole in your ministry 
 I heard of the dark arts and underground chemistry 
 (I'm letting the globe know) 
 'Cause I'm the mole in your ministry 
 Take the cross from the rose 
 And there's no more energy 
 (It's set to explode) 
 'Cause I'm the mole in your ministry 
 I've been to the rainbow 
 The fake gold tempted me 
 (The mystery's age old) 
 'Cause I'm the mole in your ministry
