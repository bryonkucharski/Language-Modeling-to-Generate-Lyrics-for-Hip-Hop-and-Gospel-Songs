I'm not a fan of Sinatra 
 I busted out the waiting room 
 With a glance at the doctor 
 They caught me at the ocean 
 Holding hands with a lobster 
 Other hand full of vodka 
 Rubber bands in my pants 
 So I can dance in the aqua 
 ('Gotta dance' is the mantra) 
 Aqua Man is a monster 
 Both the cops and the robbers 
 Are dropping tabs on the pasta 
 So don't eat the tortellini 
 It's pork and bean-y 
 It needs a little pepper 
 And seventy-four zucchinis 
 I'm more than peachy 
 So you can grab a fork and eat me 
 And my organs weekly 
 Since I'm becoming bored and sleepy 
 (I'd rather be in orbit spinning) 
 Uncork the Henny 
 Its almost four o' clock 
 And I'm ready for Mork and Mindy 
 The show is very orphan friendly 
 I need the comfort 
 To feed the hunger 
 Because there's strength and speed and numbers 
 (So heed the thunder) 
 And watch the lightning 'cause it's frightening 
 And so exciting when you see the light before the striking 
 This is for the bums 
 Tuberculosis victims with the water on their lungs 
 This is for the punks 
 This is for the meek 
 This is for the geniuses that don't know how to speak 
 This is for the lame 
 This is for the herbs 
 Social lubrication in the handiness of words 
 This is for the small 
 This is for the weird 
 People who know better than to follow what they hear 
 This is for your fears 
 My poetry is kept 
 Where I'm socially inept 
 And so the fingernail of small talk 
 Is pokin' me to death 
 I'm supposed to be an extrovert 
 But I've observed 
 That I prefer to hide behind having a lack of nerve 
 He's sort of an attractive turd 
 A taller midget 
 But walked with his head tall 
 So he got all the digits 
 He never had the gall to talk of his appalling visions 
 He saw the laws of physics twisted when he closed his eyes 
 And so he tried 
 To teach himself to vocalize 
 What his open mind told him to write in them broken lines 
 Unorganized quantum physics 
 Language banging leaps 
 Awkward angles reached danger 
 Sprinkled in his tangled speech 
 Son of a preacher man 
 Dancing like Peter Pan 
 Sucking on a thermometer 
 To see where my fever lands 
 Should I call the doctor 
 Or just dial the reefer man 
 Either plan's decent 
 I just wish to breathe again 
 This is for the bums 
 Tuberculosis victims with the water on their lungs 
 This is for the punks 
 This is for the meek 
 This is for the geniuses that don't know how to speak 
 This is for the lame 
 This is for the herbs 
 Social lubrication in the handiness of words 
 This is for the small 
 This is for the weird 
 People who know better than to follow what they hear 
 This is for your fears
