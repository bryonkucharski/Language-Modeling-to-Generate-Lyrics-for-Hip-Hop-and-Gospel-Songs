It's a shelter for battered artists 
 With nightly contests to see who's been smacked the hardest 
 But only press half the charges 
 'Cause we love the punishment like any other passive martyrs 
 It's the Stockholm syndrome 
 A house full of runaways that's not gon' get home 
 It's not where overly macho men go 
 We killed bravado 
 With a steel Silverado 
 Twelve step program for pills or the bottle 
 And right down the hill from a brothel 
 Sorry sex addicts 
 Sometimes the party gets crackin' 
 Groovin' to a soundtrack of REM sadness 
 (Fiesta!) 
 We use the term very loosely 
 We play bid whist and serve cherry juice drink 
 Dr. Serengeti has a Burberry mood ring 
 And goes on rants like an absurd Gary Busey 
 Ain't no party like an Art Rap Party 
 'Cause an Art Rap Party's so smart (x4) 
 With or without 'shrooms 
 A boom bap odyssey 
 Arguing how to record the two-track properly 
 (Hey, yo, who's that?) 
 It's new rap possibly 
 Fucking up my discussion of Bloom's Taxonomy 
 What's the point I was making? 
 Debating on whether Barack has joined with the Masons 
 Various platforms are poised for the taking 
 Like whether or not 'Pac was anointed as sacred 
 (Two queens just walked in) 
 With Grade A faces 
 In low cut bald fades and gray laced Asics 
 To get 'em you need to be talking paid vacations 
 Or have original game like James A. Naismith 
 (One of 'em's knock-kneed) 
 The other walks pigeon toed 
 (One brought Saki) 
 The other brought dinner rolls 
 (One wears red locs) 
 The other's light indigo 
 (One likes Death Note) 
 The other likes Ninja Scroll 
 Ain't no party like an Art Rap Party 
 'Cause an Art Rap Party's so smart (x4) 
 C'mon raise your glasses up 
 As Regan recites a page from Britannica 
 On the life of Jack Kerouac 
 Killing everybody like Iraq air attacks 
 I know you'd like to write scary tracks 
 Princess Superstar would like her mascara back 
 Somebody spins Paris Zax 
 Bringing folks together like the twins in the Parent Trap 
 Around a Fat Tire keg 
 We're rappers discussing what other rap writers said 
 White Rabbit made a wallet out of black spiders' legs 
 Then we all rap about it till the campfire's dead 
 Ain't no party like an Art Rap Party 
 'Cause an Art Rap Party's so smart (x4)
