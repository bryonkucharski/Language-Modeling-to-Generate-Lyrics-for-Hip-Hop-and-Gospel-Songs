Maybe we should've stayed, where we was 
 We hopped in thinking it was a game, and it was 
 We made it then celebrated post-game, but the buzz 
 My hindsight's blurry it's looking grey, with a fuzz 
 Trying to muster all the foresight I can use, for the road 
 Cause out here ain't no streetlights I can view, where we go 
 This was supposed to be the desert I'm confused, 'cause it's cold 
 Seeking what sunlight reflecting off the moon, could expose 
 Took two, for the road 
 Drank three, in the zone 
 Drank four, to the dome 
 Couple hits from the bowl hit the road 
 But maybe we should've stayed, where we was 
 We hopped in thinking it never rains, but it does 
 And this is the loneliest stretch of road, we done seen 
 Two hundred miles to go and not a pole, in between 
 Don't roll, don't careen 
 Two hands, on the wheel keep control 
 I don't know if I'm speeding or going slow, in a dream 
 Slidin' in the shimmership, hidden by the riverbank 
 Hovering over the desert running not a real estate 
 Giant silver snake, grinding trying to hit the breaks, big mistake 
 Just trying to stay awake on the innerstate 
 I can't touch the bottom but I'm floating hella deep 
 I had a co-pilot but they fucking fell asleep 
 You're supposed to be another set of motherfucking eyes 
 You shared your entertaining thoughts but now I'm stuck with mine 
 Damn near fucking blind, don't know why you trust me to drive 
 I guess cause every time you trust, we survive, but it's time 
 Is a motherfucking gamble 
 Eventually lady luck will call and say she cancels 
 You betting on my confidence when I was extra high, now I'm extra high 
 We'll pull over just to rest my eyes 
 And the only thing, fueling me is that I'm scared to die 
 And I'm scared for you cause you could die and never said goodbye 
 Why you trust me so? Why'd you let me lead 
 When I don't know where I'm going and I speed? 
 And this vehicle's the jankiest 
 Feel this coffee ruining my stomach and my pancreas 
 Sounds make me the angriest 
 So foggy the words, seem to be turning in different languages I 
 Slidin' in the shimmership, hidden by the riverbank 
 Hovering over the desert running not a real estate 
 Giant silver snake, grinding trying to hit the breaks, big mistake 
 Just trying to stay awake on the innerstate 
 Maybe we should've stayed, where we was 
 This is the loneliest planet I've ever seen 
 And I am in no state to try to fly, this machine 
 I don't know this terrain 
 All my instruments are twisted all my needles won't behave 
 I don't know what's in this atmosphere so when we finally crash 
 I don't know if we'll be able to breathe, if we'll be able to leave 
 I have the tools to repair, whatever structures we tear 
 I know at first it was yeah, but I was so unaware 
 Of like the cost of the fuel 
 It started awesome now we're tossed and I lost all of my cool
