First step is intention, second step is a glance 
 Then divine intervention 
 Mixing science religion 
 Pretending like we giants 
 Promise I was the biggest 
 For the lovers of dancing, this is color enhancing 
 Two strangers passing on the metro, what were the chances 
 People walk into circles 
 Every audience listens 
 They taking turns judging, everybody got issues 
 I be moving my feet and on varied tables I'm eating on 
 Up, we're cutting a rug, was is something I said 
 Put on Erykah's album, I can tear up a mountain 
 Get your eagle on, naw, more peregrine falcon 
 They sit in the darkness 
 They connect they courting naked in different apartments 
 Don't say nothing that's awkward 
 Take them up on that offer 
 And you'll be partnered up for life flying up in a saucer 
 And they trying to cat daddy, I'm hella allergic 
 I've been doing my research, so I know that move 
 I studied them all 
 I seen that swing 
 I've been watching it for hours, so don't get too close 
 She kick real high 
 They swing real low 
 I done been in that position so I know that spell 
 I read that book 
 I know those lines, I see 'em coming back around 
 First step is intention, second step is a glance 
 Then divine intervention 
 Mix of science religion 
 Environmentalist dance, make 'em sign a petition 
 For the lovers of dancing, this is color enhancing 
 Two strangers passing on the freeway, what were the chances 
 Don't be acting embarrassed, that's the whackest awareness 
 They get it in before their skin starts cracking and tearing 
 Heaven's not for the living 
 Ordained reverend and comparative monster religion 
 Sit in my pews 
 Cruise ship in the Pacific, we can bend the rules 
 And do the Transylvania boogie to forbidden blues 
 She did the peanut butter jelly, ain't nobody looking 
 The soul train line's long and it's sloppily crooking 
 The chicken noodle soup and poodle skirt and hula hooping 
 ? 
 Ain't no keeping a distance, murdered the? 
 I've been doing my research, so I know that move 
 I studied them all 
 I seen that swing 
 I've been watching it for hours, so don't get too close 
 She kick real high 
 They swing real low 
 I done been in that position so I know that spell 
 I read that book 
 I know those lines, I see 'em coming back around 
 We can do it for safety like a factory worker 
 Trying to balance a beam 
 Skirt's floating 'cause she's twirling around in a dream 
 It's the easiest hustle 
 You catch a swing and then you squeeze your trapezius muscles 
 It takes a year or two 
 Your old friends you done found yourself getting nearer to 
 Who wants to hear the truth 
 Well you can do the wop 
 And plug us in, we got it poppin' in computer shops 
 First step is intention, second step is a glance 
 Then divine intervention 
 Mixing science religion 
 Pretending like we giants 
 Promise I was the biggest 
 For the lovers of dancing, this is color enhancing 
 Two strangers passing in the hallway, what were the chances
