How are things for you? 
 I been writing pretty lyrics 
 But missing someone to sing 'em to 
 Have the people you've been meeting been affable? 
 I've been faxing you messages 
 Errors syntactical 
 If there's an actual opening in your space time 
 Erase my voicemail messages from your dateline 
 I taped mine under a false pretense 
 A temporary lapse in cunning and lost street sense 
 In the spring and summer 
 It's all peaches 
 Now a full court press 
 But I'm running the wrong defense 
 Grief stricken 
 'Cause she's Witches of Eastwickin' 
 My cauldron's cold 
 Cause the heat's missing 
 Hope your pretty kitty keeps on pissing on all your documents 
 Your kitchen smells of Polish sausages 
 We're polar opposites 
 A known common sense 
 I've recently grown cognizant of: 
 There's no point in polishing mud 
 In the state of conflict, the refs will have quirks 
 The ushers have flashlights, and I got works 
 For the ways that you treat me with all and stalls 
 And the things said discretely 
 Let it go on, let it go on 
 Lurch like a world spinning off its axis 
 Cause the cat pissed on your faxes 
 Sharpen up the axes 
 We'll teach that kitty to piss on important transmissions 
 I'm done with ass kissing 
 Starting it was the hard part 
 You're like a magician 
 Fingers quick as a card shark 
 I been a fan since then 
 Loaning you an enlarged heart 
 I sent you transmissions 
 You were thinking of car parts 
 Bought you an aardvark instead of an anteater 
 And you pleasure yourself with electrical ass tweezers 
 That's either a sadness or a sickness 
 Giving a whole new meaning to being on her "shit list" 
 I've been rescued 
 Like Jews on Schindler's 
 I'm still representing for the coupon spenders 
 I hear your new dude has a Yukon with spinners 
 I got some fresh fruit and a new Braun blender 
 In the state of conflict, the refs will have quirks 
 The ushers have flashlights, and I got works 
 For the ways that you treat me with all and stalls 
 And the things said discretely 
 Let it go on, let it go on 
 Lurch like a world spinning off its axis 
 Cause the cat pissed on your faxes 
 Sharpen up the axes 
 We'll teach that kitty to piss on important transmissions 
 I could never be a simple brother 
 Cause the world ain't black and white 
 Some of this shit's magenta colored 
 There's different other shades of periwinkle 
 When Mary tinkles 
 It resembles berry sprinkles 
 A crotchety thin old hairy wrinkled man 
 Carries tingles 
 Not to mention dingleberries 
 How long has it been since there were people caring? 
 An old monument cinched on uneven bearings 
 Directing filthy poetry at his three canaries 
 He finds Jesus very comforting in his old age 
 Just left church 
 Cussin' at people 
 Road rage
