Writing on the floor of a Chinese restaurant 
 Crown on my hip like Simon Petrikov 
 Thought of a song called 'Thinking of Master Plans' 
 Reagan and Rakim drinking in Amsterdam 
 Cafe back room meeting with cancer man 
 Engineering project black astronaut 
 The first scene in the film Prometheus 
 I wrote a brand new story that starts from there 
 Just need some help with the financing 
 I ain't got nobody to pitch it to 
 My friends are superheros 
 None of us have very much money though 
 They can fly, run fast, read Portuguese 
 None of us have very much money though 
 They know judo and yoga, photography, politics 
 Some of them leap over buildings 
 Writers, magicians, comedians, astronauts 
 None of it mattered when niggas was hungry 
 My friends are superheros 
 None of us have very much money though 
 They wear the same underwear as billionaires 
 None of us have very much money though 
 Hustlers, beatmakers, drug dealers, sculptors 
 Ego-maniacal authors and bloggers 
 Some of them talk to the animals 
 None of it mattered when niggas was hungry 
 That shit's not valuable 
 Come say it to my face 
 That shit's not valuable 
 Come say it to my face 
 It's all disposable 
 Come say it to my face 
 I was hoping this device might cure my remembering 
 I'm eighty-seven percent sure I invented it 
 High adrenaline I'm rapping on the cake boss 
 Name on the dressing room, so I ain't lost 
 Commencing countdown takeoff 
 Another sound stage, rehearsing a fake space walk 
 Lil' Wayne is an ancient African 
 Jay-Z's been around since the 20s though 
 The only new ones is Lil' B and One Be Lo 
 We only got a hundred months to go 
 Until your hometown's covered under tons of snow 
 It goes one, two, three, four, five little Indians 
 When it's all over I survive on the Pentium 
 Chips, cinnamon flavored memory sticks 
 And I'll flash, take a picture 
 'Cause I won't remember 
 That shit's not valuable 
 Come say it to my face 
 That shit's disposable 
 Come say it to my face 
 It's not authentic though 
 Come say it to my face 
 That's so ingenuine 
 Come say it to my face 
 My friends are superheros 
 None of us have very much money though 
 They can fly, run fast, read Portuguese 
 None of us have very much money though 
 They can make hair grease out of fruits and herbs 
 None of us have very much money though 
 They can take selfies like Dubuffet 
 None of us have very much money though
