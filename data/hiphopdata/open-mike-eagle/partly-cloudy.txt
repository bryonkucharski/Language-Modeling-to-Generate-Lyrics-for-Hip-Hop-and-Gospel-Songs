The forecast is partly cloudy 
 So party loudly 
 And make sure that it's hearty sounding 
 He's crowned king of the evening 
 Whistling the chord swings to "The Sweetest Thing" 
 A genie with a brown leather wish bag 
 With the power to wring out the clouds like a dishrag 
 Let it rain, soak it in 
 Your electric brain and golden skin 
 Needs to accept the pain and hold it in 
 Till the coda stops 
 Let that pressure in 
 Fizz like it's soda pop 
 The last ray of the setting sun 
 Let it come 
 The water pressure's better when it runs 
 This is second to none 
 Who gets the Motts? 
 I not by chance 
 I rain dance, I rain dance 
 If they want to come 
 Let them come 
 I'll never run 
 I'll yell until I see my severed tongue 
 It weighs a metric ton 
 Who gets the Motts? 
 I not by chance 
 I rain dance, I rain dance 
 And there should be no discussion 
 And this is the wrong time to drown in your Robitussin 
 (So disgusting) 
 There's a volcano erupting 
 I'm just waiting for y'all to say "no" to something 
 Pick a card any card 
 Penny pub or big bizarre tittie bar 
 Keeping chrome rims on your shitty car 
 Pretty bartenders get tricked with y'all Citi cards 
 Big cigars for the smoking 
 Tricked by reflections 
 Counting stars in the ocean 
 (Oh shit) 
 I'm just looking for my sun sign 
 Your spine's crooked so you unwind
