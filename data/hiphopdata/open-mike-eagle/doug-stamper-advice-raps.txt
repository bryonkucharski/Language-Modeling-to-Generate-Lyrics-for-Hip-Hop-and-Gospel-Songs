 If you find yourself down in Southern Illinois 
 Cop a mixtape from DJ Snowy Boo-boo, (that's a real dude?) yeah

 And memorize your parts like a sharp-tongued artisan 
 Always tell a lie to C.I.A. torturers 
 Never buy weed from a guy named Mortimer 
 Buy bank forfeitures and foreclosures 
 If you start to lose your hair skip the comb-over 
 When you home open a game with the Orioles 
 A journalist should never write a slang editorial 
 You're drowning in quicksand

 His hairline fucked up from the HGH 
 Went from one hair band to like, eighty-eight 
 You ain't a thug, stop acting like you've been through shit 
 Stop paying for them porn site memberships (that shit's a waste)

 But that other stuff, I mean that other stuff
