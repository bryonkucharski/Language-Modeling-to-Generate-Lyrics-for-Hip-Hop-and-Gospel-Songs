Whether it's the weekend or weekday night 
 You know the Swim Team's gonna rock until ya go home 
 (Sahtyre) 
 Show's over 
 (Lights out) 
 If I don't know ya 
 (Bye now) 
 We rocking till the vocoder dies out 
 Ladies you can go home or roll over my house 
 Nice blouse 
 That'll match perfectly on my white couch 
 All the die-hard fanatics go to dive bars 
 Where you can see live art and a show 
 I got a fatty rolled 
 I'll blow it on the patio 
 Then tally-ho back on stage 
 And make my final cameo 
 Till all y'all wanna stay 
 (Can We?), No! 
 You really want to? 
 (Yeah! Yeah!) 
 Badly? (No) 
 So let me make it loud and clear: 
 You do have to go home 
 And get the hell up outta here 
 (Lyraflip) 
 If art imitates life 
 Then life's imitating art 
 Cause every moment I breathe 
 I need to be razor sharp 
 You ain't creative 
 Well maybe you should just play your part 
 And live in hiatus 
 Cause your playlist just got a change of heart 
 A major spark of imagination 
 Could lessen a little aggression 
 So stop neglecting 
 Your self-expression therapy sessions 
 To me it's being artistic 
 Every second could lead to something articulate 
 Even all the misfits don't want it against me 
 I'm Leonardo da Vinci with the heart of an MC 
 Vincent Van Gogh with a wicked rap flow 
 And I'm Michelangelo with an easel 
 Don't tempt me

 (Rogue Venom) 
 Sound and color theory 
 I got an overstock series of Krylon oil acrylics 
 Crayola codes compose to paint the ceiling with vivid surrealism 
 Till your ears leak crimson ink finish 
 Live canvas collage self-portraits 
 Perform unique image 
 Styles of beyond 
 Reachin' belief in what you seein' 
 Imagination zoned out like you be eating amanitas 
 But let me ease up for a second 
 Put away the easel 
 Admiring my anesthetic sketches from afar 
 Illustrated thoughts mirror mirage 
 Reflected off the wall 
 They yelling encore before we close out 
 Shut the show down 
 Thanks for the support 
 But yo it's time to go now 
 (X2) 
 Whether it's the weekend or weekday night 
 You know the Swim Team's gonna rock until ya go home 
 (Psychosiz) 
 Psycho scores the purest chocha 
 Playing like I got four controllers 
 I won't eat no meat that ain't die for me to get close to 
 (Imitation's the sincerest form of flattery) 
 Look at her! 
 She ain't the sharpest painting in the gallery 
 But she'll dip out the back with me without me even asking 
 If or when she plan to leave like 
 You got the keys right? 
 Let's motivate 
 I've overstayed my welcome 
 Baby 
 Walk it out 
 Bike and route ride it out till I get out 
 And hitch hike to somewhere I can rollerblade to hell from 
 Maybe 
 Maybe not 
 Skirt shark 
 I can smell perfume from eighty blocks with my nose stopped 
 And nose stuffed from a cold in a cold front 
 With the snow up to my nose froze to my cold ducts 
 (Open Mike Eagle) 
 Open brings his own 'cause the microphone sucks 
 I sing but reproducing that type of tone's tough 
 I bought me a harmonizer to liven shows up 
 Ladies and gents it was nice to meet you 
 This is Michael Eagle 
 Signing off for all of the righteous people 
 Wipe the easel 
 It's a finished mission 
 If you get the vision 
 Then your spirit'll be in mint condition 
 If you listen you'll notice that Open isn't Christian 
 We still gon' end it with a benediction 
 Everybody let's go home 
 So welcome to my sanctuary 
 We're all the same even if skin of the different races vary 
 The enemies make a face that's scary 
 But they're Frankenberry 
 And I'm fearless after a case of sherry 
 Gimme another shot of holy water 
 So I can stay afloat 
 Like a leaky yacht in a boat regatta 
 Before I go into some old Sinatra 
 I can recite a whole sonata 
 Like the thirty man code in Contra 
 And leave seeds like a broken father 
 Most MCs they need soap and water 
 In the key of C my approach is awkward 
 Until I bust some Beethoven on ya 
 (X2)
