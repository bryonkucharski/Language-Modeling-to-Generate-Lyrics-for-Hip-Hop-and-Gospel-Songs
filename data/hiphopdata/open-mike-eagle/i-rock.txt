It is insulting 
 'Cause I can't rap for my job, job, job, job, job 
 I'd quit this bullshit 
 But I can't live like a slob, slob, slob, slob, slob 
 The way I want to baby 
 Swimming in hip-hop-hip-hop-hip 
 I want to sing for you and show you how I rock 
 My situation's kinda dire 
 Because I'm one of the livest rhymers 
 That's also a nine-to-fiver 
 (I gotta wait until nighttime) 
 To rhyme in ciphers 
 My supervisor's always asking why my eyes are tired 
 I thank God I'm not a firefighter 
 'Cause every morning I drink coffee 
 'Til I'm nice and wired 
 It keeps me up until lunchtime 
 And then I eat but the Niggeritis is unkind 
 I fell asleep at a red light one time 
 In front of middle schoolers on an afternoon bus ride 
 I'm unsigned 
 So that's how it is sometimes 
 Wishing I could punch my card with a punch line 
 Every night something's crackin' 
 From regular grungy rapping 
 To underground funk and dancing 
 I put my best foot first 
 On Monday nights with Blaque Whole Suns at the Good Hurt 
 I go to work then I rap at night 
 And so my Tuesday appetite's satisfied at Raggsta Nites 
 I've seen more rump than an ass doctor 
 On Wednesday nights with Tommy Blak at the Grasshopper 
 Or I could roll to the Lower End 
 If I can't pay the toll 
 I gotta ask No again 
 (Thursday's work day) 
 You already knowing kid 
 I'm a J.U.I.C.E. board member and a Blowedian 
 My Friday night yearning hunger 
 Is curbed with serving suckers and herbs at the Urban Underground 
 Hear the sound of a tired rapper 
 (Down the street in Chinatown at the Firecracker)
