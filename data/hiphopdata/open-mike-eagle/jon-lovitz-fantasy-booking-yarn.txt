Come do a show in heaven 
 Come do a show on the fucking moon 
 Book you a show in heaven 
 Book you a show on the fucking moon 
 How 'bout one mil for a guarantee 
 It's pretty low, I know it's embarrassing 
 You got thousands of fans here 
 We did some polling and we counted them last year 
 The venue requests right next to you 
 You'll stay at the guest house it's connected to 
 We want you here hella bad 
 We painted your logo on our helipad 
 We listen so we know how you travel sir 
 Fire up your helicopter flux capacitor 
 We'll give you a hundred percent up front 
 After sound check you won't have to get up once 
 And you can bring all the merch you got 
 Vinyl, CDs, stickers, shirts and socks 
 We know lugging tote bags hurts a lot 
 So we'll buy up the remains and purchase the box 
 And we'll pay you in gold doubloons 
 Our ten-piece house band knows all your tunes 
 Plus we bought all the shit you use 
 And if you wanna you can take it with you when you cruise 
 We bought the rights to your mini-doc 
 Showman get on the screen as large as a city block 
 We bought some advertising in the weekly too 
 Enough to get a feature and a sweet review 
 Our pre-sale numbers are in the thousands 
 Which is pretty funny we haven't even announced it 
 So once you've approved and the money shifts 
 You and your band on the moon June 25th 
 "Oh that's your, that's your wedding anniversary? 
 Oh, damn, I guess we'll have to uh, get up with you next time 
 Don't call us, we'll call you" 
 Book you a show in heaven 
 Book you a show on the fucking moon 
 Come do a show in heaven 
 Come do a show on the fucking moon
