(Busdriver) 
 All my niggas with Vulcan ears 
 Are auctioneers for these tape deck airlifts 
 While these thuggy rugby playing Huggy bears 
 Rally for same-sex marriage 
 (Open Mike Eagle) 
 They're having children out of wedlock after latex tearing 
 Leaving their honorable families disgraced 
 Embarrassed 
 (Busdriver) 
 They rap in Gaelic hair care tips and run shit like a legless heiress 
 Wait, what the fuck am I saying? 
 (Open Mike Eagle) 
 The pen's pregnant 
 It's waddling with its ankles swollen 
 About to give birth to what should have been the Bangles' opus 
 It's a bouquet full of faded roses 
 But tighter than Lederhosen 
 When German tanks invaded Poland 
 (Busdriver) 
 But not as tight as the acceptance speech 
 That I gave the thankful mole men 
 As I'm crowned king 
 I'm Yao Ming under the turntable molding 
 I've got the sexiest job 
 Espionage and fandangled coding 
 As I lie to millions like Dan Rather 
 (Open Mike Eagle) 
 Well, fuck it 
 I'll be a dance rapper 
 Fastening my pants backwards 
 Rambling about Franz Ferdinand and Franz Kafka 
 For spittin' it nice 
 I'll give you advice like Ann Landers 
 (Busdriver) 
 And from me you shall be handed lanyards 
 Before you're picked clean 
 Your haircut's 16 when you're obviously 36 
 Gravy drips on your pancreas in my serving dish 
 'Cause I don't approve bookings of Sexual Chocolate's front man 
 I crush his glands to the size of a Hershey's kiss 
 In a cursing fit 
 (Open Mike Eagle) 
 We get down like treasure hunters unearthing shit 
 Nasty as Heather Hunter's leather covered nursing tits 
 Writing with feathers from buzzards on weathered rubber 
 And these cheddar lovers suck 
 'Cause they've yet to discover Thirsty Fish 
 (Busdriver) 
 Mother f' your puckered pecker when you're dressed like Sgt. Pepper 
 (Open Mike Eagle) 
 This larkish feather writes the largest letters on the parchment ever 
 (Busdriver) 
 Cut the cheddar stutter-stepper and I'll glue your stuff together 
 (Open Mike Eagle) 
 Stuffin' letters cussin' 'cause I like your mother's muffins better 
 (Busdriver) 
 See you've been outted by the unexcitable diploma earner 
 Sojourner Truth's afterbirth hanging off of some Chola's cursor click 
 (Open Mike Eagle) 
 We stick together like frozen burgers 
 The shit we spit is original as the oldest 
 Werther's Butterscotch confection 
 (Outro: Busdriver) 
 Man these fools can't even rap half as tight 
 I be going to their funerals blowing bagpipes, aha 
 Fool, I'm twice as dope, I'm longer than an isotopes half-life 
 Get it, 'cause I'm long, I'm long, I'm long 
 Either my shlong, or my career, ugh 
 Yeah, I'm a cypher eradicator, No I'm not 
 Too old for that shit, too old for that shit 
 So I got to go on with it, rapping...
