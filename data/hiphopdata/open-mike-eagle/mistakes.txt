Don't go beating yourself up 
 'Cause we all make mistakes 
 We trying to get the g's and the wealth up 
 We trying to get paid 
 (Alpha MC) 
 I'm back at it again 
 Like a crack addict with pens 
 In the alley in the back of the rehab that he went to 
 That's how I look at my cheese 
 Kraft on my mental 
 When neither one of them were suffering 
 From the negative chi that I give in to 
 'Cause if at first you don't succeed 
 Don't get discouraged 
 Just get some herb and smoke some weed 
 A moment's occur when you were zonin' and your focus returns 
 I don't know the path to happiness 
 All I know is Swim Team cats is traveling 
 And no one has the answers 
 Cause the universe is vast and babbling 
 Way bigger than the cash you carrying 
 It don't help to marinate in every mistake you make 
 But it does help to know the right people 
 I'm flowing tight steelos 
 When I'm standing over my steeple 
 Accompanied by Open Mike Eagle 
 Don't go beating yourself up 
 'Cause we all make mistakes 
 We trying to get the g's and the wealth up 
 We trying to get paid 
 (Open Mike Eagle) 
 Go ahead and rock your chain with pride 
 Be sure to get a diamond for every one of the slaves that died 
 Unless you wanna work eight to five 
 And not get paid to rhyme with a hater and an Asian guy 
 (The Underground) 
 Never got you in the first place 
 Go write some shit that chicks can rock to on their birthdates 
 Better yet a ghostwriter for the first take 
 Purchase some heat and hit the streets like an earthquake 
 Think of the people drinking their beer on the freeway 
 You want them bumping Brittany Spears in the PJs? 
 There isn't a market for weird rappers these days 
 Gotta support the careers of Clear Channel's DJs 
 Go write or rap about vagina meat 
 I'll help you find a beat 
 Cause nigga you just tryna to eat! 
 And fuck a clever rapping movement 
 You say that you sold rocks 
 You never have to prove it 
 Don't go beating yourself up 
 'Cause we all make mistakes 
 We trying to get the g's and the wealth up 
 We trying to get paid
