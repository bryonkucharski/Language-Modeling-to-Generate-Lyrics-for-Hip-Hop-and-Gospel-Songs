(Nocando) 
 I'm underground man like I'm beneath the streets 
 I dress nice but I ain't no goddamned sneaker freak 
 I freestyle, if you need receipts buy CDs from me 
 These good for nothing scenesters, treat me like a piece of meat 
 And if I am it's gotta be well done Filet Mignon 
 I'm a walking rail gun, aiming songs, saying Psalms 
 Yay though I walk through the valley of mediocre monuments 
 I promise to break 'em off, until the day that they evolve 
 (Open Mike Eagle) 
 This to all the adolescent Negro lads 
 Who make sketches and day dream the whole class 
 In '96 they would have been De La Soul fans 
 (In 2010) It's My Chemical Romance 
 Still rebellin' since it's the first sign of intelligence 
 (Today) Shirt size more relevant 
 Tight long sleeves won't disguise your melanin 
 But it's too late to lionize the four elements 
 (Open Mike Eagle, then Nocando) 
 And I won't apologize for it 
 This is not a bunch of ravings but a bunch of black man's art 
 And I promise 
 The status quo will never be my friend 
 And I promise 
 The way it is'll never be again 
 (Open Mike Eagle) 
 Shows filled with back packers 
 And drunk party girls in heels and black rap shirts 
 Scene's built on the backs of black rappers 
 (Somehow) When I'm asking for cash you can't answer 
 Descendants of the folks that shackled my ancestors 
 Come to watch us battle and cackle like Fran Drescher 
 That's the demographic since it's been adapted 
 Bottled up and sold as some old nigga magic 
 (Nocando) 
 Now everybody's got a rapper friend 
 But my name's higher on the flyer 
 There's a reason I'm performing after them 
 You know what makes you seem less important? 
 You just came here to cock jock your best friend's boyfriend 
 You don't deserve to stand there 
 Embezzling our damn air 
 Showin' unemotional fanfare 
 And acting like you can't care 
 Well I don't give a fuck if you're somebody's co-worker 
 From So-and-So Burger 
 That freestyles with MC Mo Murder 
 (Open Mike Eagle, then Nocando) 
 And I won't apologize for it 
 This is not a bunch of ravings but a bunch of black man's art 
 And I promise 
 The status quo will never be my friend 
 And I promise 
 The way it is'll never be again [x2] 
 (Nocando) 
 Every time you see me in the place 
 You can see it on my face 
 I got raps full of dope like Maria Full of Grace 
 Like a cheetah with the pace 
 But not a cheater in the race 
 The kids make me sick like gonorrhea anyway 
 Too many egos in the way 
 Thinking somebody should king 'em 
 In a kingdom, but Rome didn't shank Caesar in a day 
 (Open Mike Eagle) 
 Cause my little brother never heard of Little Brother 
 Cause all the girls in their video kept their nipples covered 
 The only ones he can discover 
 Are the ones that please Viacom's executive nigga lovers 
 So it's another monkey-po gimmick 
 Sambo videos with country crows in 'em 
 Middle school virgins playing run-and-go-get-it 
 'Cause they memorized songs about nuttin' on women
