Started life as a Christian 
 I was enticed by religion 
 To spark a spiritual life that was missing 
 As an acolyte 
 A white Jesus had me actin' right 
 Chasing the thoughts of an after life 
 So I attended service like clockwork 
 Sunday's best 
 And socks from the top drawer 
 But Jesus wasn't the reason for my Oxfords 
 I mostly went for this girl I had the hots for 
 Whenever I was kinda bored 
 Thoughts of the girl I adored ignite a war 
 Haunted by the angry white Jesus by the door 
 Natural impulses I strive to ignore 
 I was divided to the core 
 The age-old battle 
 Between human anatomy vs. science of the Lord 
 I came real close to leaving my burdens by the door 
 Until I asked the preacher man about the dinosaurs 
 (Jefferson DeJesus) 
 It seems if we lie 
 Will we lay there beside it? 
 They say that it's right 
 But it doesn't seem righteous 
 (Serengeti) 
 She didn't really wanna get Botox really 
 She rather vowed against it 
 But opportunity arose 
 It would increase her chances to get this gig 
 Her manager said 
 "I'm not saying anything 
 But we could really use it right now 
 Besides what's the big deal? 
 Everybody does it 
 We need the work 
 And as I face it 
 Everybody hires once 
 We gotta play the game 
 We're married to a different fuckin' custom 
 A pioneer of something new? 
 That's a lotta work to do 
 I personally I don't think that you got it in you 
 To champion a new cause 
 You look really good in draws 
 Sometimes you gotta follow fuckin' laws and shit" 
 (Jefferson DeJesus) 
 They rival the stars 
 And they all fight with lightning 
 We sit by the fire 
 And conspire here in silence 
 It seems if we lie 
 Will we lay there beside it? 
 They say that it's right 
 But it doesn't seem righteous
