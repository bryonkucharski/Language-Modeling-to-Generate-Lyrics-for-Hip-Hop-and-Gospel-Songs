Shout to the Jesuses 
 Nail me to the couch, say ouch for the hedonists 
 Alcohol in the cuts, have to let it burn 
 I watch bad movies cause that's what I deserve 
 Thumbtack in my shoe really really tiny 
 Whenever I forget to feel sad it reminds me 
 Sad, it's all alone, DMX song 
 And train for the pain so the chain keeps my neck strong 
 Ouch! 
 My bones mad brittle 
 Lips stay quivering to hold back spittle 
 Keep getting tattoos of old black riddles cause "nobody knows" 
 All good feels are mirages 
 So don't waste your money on weed or massages 
 Nah, I'm in the hood hearing sirens 
 And the beat tried to make me feel good but it's lying 
 So I stood in defiance 
 I'm only in it for the pain and the truth is you're lonely and ashamed 
 And lonely, and ashamed and lonely, and sad 
 No one in the world ever gets what they want and that is beautiful 
 Everybody di- 
 See that's exactly what the fuck I'm talking about 
 It's bullshit 
 (I don't know what's happening dude 
 I'm gonna try to fix it, just chill out, alright?) 
 Everything happens to me!
