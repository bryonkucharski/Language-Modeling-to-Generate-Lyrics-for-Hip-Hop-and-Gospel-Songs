 Intro: Raekwon the Chef 
 It's the remix Son 
 Can it be, act like you know 
 Check it 
 Verse One: Ghostface Killer 
 Yo, check what happened out of state 
 I'm knocking off a half-a-cake Cash Rule, flying at a fast rate 
 I smoke the black dust kept my hands clutched, I'm fallin' in lust 
 Spore plush I played my hand like a royal flush 
 Baggy jeans, Wallabee Clarks, pretty woman 
 I put it in him, shot up in him, deadly venom 
 I hung around the big time bosses 
 Illegal force exchange thoughts, showing love to all my sources 
 Spades tried to bag me, like Cagney, and Lacey 
 Chef had that bitch Stacey slippin in Macy's 
 I dose off, catch a flashback on how I got trapped 
 And got licked like Papsy in a mob flick I got hit 
 Stumblin holdin' my neck to the God's rest 
 Opened flesh burgundy blood colored my Guess 
 Emergency trauma, black teen headed for surgery 
 Can it be an out of state nigga tried to murder me? 
 I should've stayed in Job Corp, but now I'm a outlaw 
 Ray Cartegna, carry a fo'-fo' nigga 
 {Can it be that it was all so simple then?} 
 Dedicated to the Gods and Earths 
 Dedicated to babies who came feet first 
 Dedicated to Up North and down state 
 Dedicated to rich niggaz who sell weights 
 Dedicated to projects with black kids 
 Dedicated to man who build pyramids 
 Word up! What the fuck yo? 
 We taking you on another chamber 
 Word up son, you know how we be on it 
 Yeah it's real 
 Show these crabs how to rhyme man 
 I think it's time to bless them, word up 
 Bulletproof 
 First chamber 
 Yo Chef yo 
 Verse Two: Raekwon 
 It started off on the Island, AK Shaolin niggaz wildin 
 Old folks scream : stop the violence! 
 True layin up yo, watchin these crack niggaz 
 Playin' nuff crap games for what see? 
 Back in days, crime pays in mad ways 
 Sportin Tommy Hil with caves 360 waves 
 And no searchin for loose ends, now flex 300 Benz 
 Mad 10's with mad diamonds 
 Now that's the life of the good life, sometimes niggaz act trife 
 I paid the price throughout my hood life 
 Remember I got blasted, now that's in the past kid 
 God forbid I lay in the casket 
 But now I'm all about G-notes, no time for weed, mixed with coke 
 I wash my mouth out with soap 
 And I got my act together, 'Lo sweaters and better 
 And fat leather, so whatever, bring it on 
 {Can it be that it was all so simple then?} 
 Yeah, for real 
 Murderous material stacked up 
 Peace to mazes, for real 
 Meditating on life 
 Gold, word up y'all 
 Crazy fly, dedication, to my people 
 Word up, peace to all my brothers that I ain't gonna see no more 
 Peace to brothers on the Island, up North 
 Word up 
 Straight up, I love you boy, it's on like that 
 Word up, word up 
 Peace to man woman and child 
 Word up 
 I got you covered baby, I'm here for you 
 Project, check it 
 Projects peoples one love 
 Keep your head clear, we out of here 
 We move in silence 
 Bad boys, creating, the muderous stacks for your headpiece 
 Baldheads, braids, blowouts 
 Yo 
 Fly chicks 
 It's the remix y'all 
 For real, the real side 
 The RZA, check it 
 Razor blade sharp 
 Peace to the Clan 
 No other producer can compare boy 
 Word up 
 Bring it, battle, beats all types of shit 
 For real y'all
