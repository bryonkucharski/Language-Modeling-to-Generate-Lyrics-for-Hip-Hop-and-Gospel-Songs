(Raekwon) 
 One for you, one for me 
 Two for you, one-two for me

 (Ghostface) 
 What? I'll smack fuck out ya 
 Smack fire out your fuckin' ass, what the fuck you think this is man? 
 Get the fuck up outta here man 
 [Raekwon] So yo matter of fact, the man is back 
 [Ghostface] Think my head is madder than fuckin' fire 
 [Raekwon] Shit aight, this ain't even enough burn right here 
 This ain't enough

 [Raekwon] We gonna shoot right over there 
 And yo them niggaz got the big CREAM over there 
 So just chill 
 [Ghostface] So let's do this the fuck up, roll up like tropical kid 
 Don't play me like I got a flowerpot head kid 
 Just chill man 
 [Raekwon] On the real let's go get this money fast Son 
 I know how we gotta do this kid 
 *Shots fire* 
 [Ghostface] Scrungy-head motherfucker 
 Verse One: Raekwon the Chef 
 Lay on the crime scene, sippin fine wines 
 Pullin nines on, UFO's, takin' they fly clothe they eyes closed 
 We gettin' loot, no doubt, check the word of mouth, unheard about 
 Guns go off and now a murder bout, I'm out 
 My raps play the part like a Get Smart secret agent 
 In a maze and, styles blazin' 
 Johnny Blaze and Tony Starks in a daze and 
 Rhymin, my nigga Lou Diamond will wrap it up 
 We like Meth to go and fuck with Noodles 
 Havin' them poodles on the lockdown buyin me 
 Amarett-ahs, and chewables, stackin pharmecuetical 
 Rap niggaz on dust and wools 
 Yo, I told you, some kill rob and fold 
 The gold's untold, fuck it it beats parole 
 So stroll marvelous, soul controller 
 Of the whole globe, god damn I got it sewn 
 And yo, whattup pop, pop the suitcase high 
 And we can talk, you can walk out the fuckin' building and get caught 
 Save the fully inflatable, rap relatable, drug relatable 
 Niggaz here to play with you 
 A hundred dollar Rottweiler goes to spot sellers 
 Guns and glocks go to niggaz who got props 
 Off top, jail niggaz get mad bigger 
 And yo, mail a guy about a hundred pictures 
 Word to momma, this rap wonderama team got drama 
 Comma, plus smoke realize marijuana 
 Chef may resign to boat across the Verrazano 
 Immaculate plus all my guns so accurate 
 They get CREAM and the cuisine in Queens 
 I told you, money stated with the night beams and two rings 
 Crazy fat, gettin' ready to do this shit 
 [Ghostface] Sniff mad shit man, what the fuck 
 *Car peels and crashes* 
 Verse Two: Ghostface Killer 
 Who's the Knucklehead, wantin respect? 
 Chop his fingers in the drug game, money well known 
 Lead singer, humdinger, flash is the aftermath 
 Here's his photograph, run up in his lab, take off the mask Chaz and think fast 
 Don't laugh, bag the cash, grab the hash, don't forget his stash 
 Grab the tear gas, and place it in his face fast 
 At full blast 
 ... 
 Then skate to the next gate further upstate 
 I heard they got crazy weight, bagged up by the kegs in 
 Crates like disco breaks, yo look out for Jakes, 
 Give it all it takes, let's burn the place before we motivate 
 Yo Blake, niggaz don't fake, rape his mate 
 If the bitch scream, for God's sake, grab the grey tape 
 It's by the plate, with the blow crushed up with the flakes 
 Killer snakes, four bodies found floatin in lakes 
 Drug related, paper talkin' 'bout the kids who didn't make it 
 Hits without a trace, never seen the Big C Rae and Ghostface 
 Congratulations Chef, let's celebrate and sip an eighth 
 Verse Three: U-God 
 The rap scar is on rap chrome, put it on seal it on 
 We're silicone, Spark it on your Talkathon 
 This rap phenomenon, to word is bond to the arms 
 Hit me on the hip and horns, rap chaperone 
 Scars tone, bar throne, war tones, raw tones 
 Blowin' out the door bones but your rap's fraudulent 
 Plug in these rap quarter inches, reinforced with suspense 
 Be on your rap sword defense, these microphone professional 
 Sensational, fully operational, 
 I got NIGGAZ here to play with you 
 You know the steez you know my whole program, brothers from the No-Lands 
 All we want is the G's, guns and grams 
 Livin' fat like the Hoffa, Mafia, sippin eatin pastas 
 Layin in the house tellin' the seeds about the sagas 
 Before we got Germanic and thoughts got sporadic 
 We grabbed golden tablets and quick guarded the Abbots 
 Slugs hit the belly put tones into the telly 
 Sucker tried to knock me out the box like skelly 
 I smoke the weed dreams I drop top two degrees 
 Honeydips spendin G's on nails and hair weave 
 The crime boss, takin' no loss, excessive force 
 We can play the A-Train, back of the iron horse 
 Yo man, knahmsayin? Fuck it man 
 *Car squeels and crashes twice*
