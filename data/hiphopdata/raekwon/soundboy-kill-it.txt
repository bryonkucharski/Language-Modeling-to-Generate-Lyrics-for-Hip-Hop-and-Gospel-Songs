Ay yo lifes good cashmere sweaters and Rover 
 Pull up at the club gettin' love pull 'em over 
 Jump out the luxury stroller for ballers 
 We sit burn money all day blow and roll up 
 Fly broads around, that's a low ball 
 Paper settlin' it's real for my gold club come up 
 You ain't even know nothing, last week all on the street 
 Yelling let me hold something 
 Now shorty throw your booty up, use it in the cash 
 Keep it above, we and Louis something 
 My style, my flight, my weather 
 Yeah, I drive high plus fly, you a double 
 Me and Ciroc with a kettle 
 Throwing cream at shorty, love it, he a rebel 
 Watch the sun 
 Ciroc with a kettle, that's why we here 
 Watch the sun 
 I see so many scars here 
 I'm gonna find another way 
 'Cause we grinding, hurting 
 Scream like we tore up in two 
 And the sea about to fall 
 And the sea about to fall 
 Hey yo, out of the slums to hell 
 When the get thrown in a cell 
 I'm like a whale and anything other, then I'm a sell 
 Black, I'm going to jail 
 I was alright chilling, shorty came by 
 Let me all night filling I'm an alright villain 
 Keep a pocket knife, if I got a brawl, I'm willing 
 Be yelling, you about the light, ball right fellows 
 It was real, couldn't stop this all night chilling 
 Step out, it's money up at night, all villain 
 First round you down, sit down, clown killer 
 I'm rad just to put you down my nigga 
 Roll block villa, catch to blow hells in the Soho hotels 
 Getting swell, my niggas, this is the first White Cell, my niggas 
 And that's why I'm eating pretty well, my nigga 
 Watch the sun 
 Ciroc with a kettle, that's why we here 
 Watch the sun 
 I see so many scars here 
 I'm gonna find another way 
 'Cause we grinding, hurting 
 Scream like we tore up in two 
 And the sea about to fall 
 And the sea about to fall
