Yeah, word, I heard about it, man 
 Yeah, word, similar story, you know? 
 Raekwon: 
 Regardless, we all ninjas, and got money, 
 But the theme of the story 
 Is yo, checking how they came for me 
 (This is it, B) 
 Kinda brief from the gold teeth era, 
 Bro dreaming on C.R.E.A.M. 
 Complimentaries and beef 
 I'm from the wild side, a militant was made by the foremost elite 
 It sound good, brung my rifle shit, clean 
 Met the others, lit a blunt, begin 
 I'm like Nicole Kidman in the wind, niggas is wild, niggas is eat 
 Then I chanced it, blood can always beat mud 
 Mud is part of being thug, I guess it's advance, we from the street 
 This is me, I'm ready to beat, whatever, we gon' off' it 
 One time alone, yo, they pricked up Unique 
 Meth standing there, rare hustler hair, right in front of the building 
 Them niggas do them killings out there 
 This is deep, me, Rebel, U-G, he walked in the room 
 Scarf rap, pair of Timberlands, beat 
 This the potion, roll the scroll out, speaked and another walked in 
 Knowing now this is a thief 
 We from the same voc's, this is like a pot roast 
 Hottest niggas who rhyme, I know them from the time, 
 This is not 'posed to happen 
 Peace Black, we wasn't cool 
 Threw the piece back, everything good, I lit the leaf, captain 
 Got a mission, to make sure the world recognize our position 
 I'm standing near the kitchen 
 Shit just might work, I lit the stink, this could be the realest shit 
 This could be the realest flip quick 
 Everybody stand up in militant, army jackets down 
 I said to myself, this the realest clique 
 True champ, we gon' rep it through, keep it cool 
 No boot camp, no hard work, just some loot, family 
 All in, ball till you fall, loyal as ever 
 I grab my leather, I'm a lay till you call 
 (Chorus x3: Raekwon) 
 Generals, demons, nighttime, vultures 
 Caught up on the ropes, let's team it 
 Everybody seen it, Zenith, what you mean? 
 Everybody C.R.E.A.M.'in', the all American dream
