Chef, let's do it 
 Criminal kingpins, gangstas and cheap friends 
 Actors, vixens, niggas put your kicks in 
 Blood money when we hawking 
 Awkward gun that go around curves 
 Bullets braze niggas with coffin, yo 
 Watch how to rhyme with hammers, I got two mens 
 That don't speak English, shooting game's bananas 
 Down in Spain, my bangles, clusty, checking my swings 
 Trillions on, yo, cuffing my jeans 
 Broad day, yo, body another, my microphone is like 
 Blow 'caine, one, pull the trees, you love us, yo 
 So killers be cool, pimps, read rules 
 When a grown man is rapping it's Ill/ Hill Street Blues 
 Striving, nigga with one side 
 Don't go against totally rent shit, nigga, baby gonna die 
 Yeah, bank robbers armored up, gear like the boys in Heat 
 De Niro told one soul to keep quiet 
 Aiyo, word to mother 
 Y'all niggas better bring yaselfs son, word 
 When Pun was packing a mack in back of the Acura 
 I was dealing in them buildings, it wasn't no cameras 
 The witness savages, snitching was hazardous, now it isn't 
 Shit is embarrassing, fuck a flow, this is a lyrical aqua duct 
 Sink or swim for what I'm hearing you bagging up 
 Lyte like the MC, I'm 'Paper Thin', you tripping 
 I'm taking trips, your eyes don't lie, take a glimpse into my life 
 You see me blazing clips with the green to make it rich 
 With a team that'll scrape the Knicks and a V that's crazy quick 
 I came to wear my Yankee fitted, represent for greatness 
 It's lyrical elevation, causing mental stimulation 
 If I'm getting too deep, I give you a minute to take in 
 My jewels radiant, like a view of the Caymans 
 And thinking you seeing me, who you playing with? 
 Cor, Mega, raw forever 
 Fell back, pause, fell off? Never 
 Shaolin, what up? 
 Aiyo, listen giraffe neck niggas, I blast techs 
 Alejandro came through with the Mexican Aztecs 
 Rap smack niggas on a whole different aspect 
 Homey, owe me dough, that's how we fucked up his last check 
 Three train Saratoga, train stop, nigga been 
 Metro part with the plan, make major figures 
 Foul flagrant, two shots, give me the ball back 
 You got shot, get off my ball sack 
 You not hot, give me a call back, niggas is all whack 
 Super doopa stupid, get drugs and I fall back 
 Ain't a problem that the God can't handle 
 I set it off First Blood, Sean John Rambo 
 Who? 
 As you can see, I'm focused 
 Boot Camp for life, fuck the G.I. Joe shit 
 Boot Camp is the army, better yet a Navy 
 Marine Air Force Ones, nigga, the shit's crazy, don't play me
