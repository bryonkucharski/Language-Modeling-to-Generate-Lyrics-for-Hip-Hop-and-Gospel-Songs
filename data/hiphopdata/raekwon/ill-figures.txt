When I write my lyrics, it's like, it's like I want my shit to be phat 
 I want people to be able to understand 
 Yo, anybody can rhyme, you know what I'm saying 
 But it's what you saying that makes a person know about you 
 Know what I'm saying, you know the type of person you is 
 So it's like really I'm just more of just 
 Being a street narrator, aiyo, what up, famo? 
 Reefer lit, love hip hop, the gangstas got me like the broccoli 
 Brooklyn baby cooling at a swat meet 
 Real niggas wanna meet me, ladies wanna eat me 
 Money clean Mercedes claim, baby beat me 
 Love getting dressed up, sweats and techs 
 Ride around the hood, good, getting Gotti respect 
 Hand is golden, an OG rolling and holding, yo 
 Fresh kicks, soft leather, pockets is swollen 
 Let my jam hit your tape deck, it's straight up and made up 
 For every real nigga with his gun on him, hate up 
 Flying through the city nights, new flights 
 Blue ice, hundred thousand in a Nike bag, license 
 Drug shop, I'm sorry, Atari in the Ferrari 
 Next see the Lex A Shallah, La Tampa 
 Eating yo, all of us, scamma gangstas 
 You know we honor, tip the kangol, cooling in the brown vengos 
 I have never, giving up on a mission 
 That's against my honor 
 Duke, let me warn you, my niggas crip up 
 Them young boys'll run up on you, shoot your whip up 
 Brooklyn, nigga, beg for you life and my Staten Island homeys 
 Lay your ass down on 'Glaciers of Ice' 
 Sidewalk executives, live the street life consecutive 
 We built for this, go for your gun 
 My prospective is, another day in the life, of money and drugs 
 Big hammers and slugs can get ugly as fuck 
 From the chest to your man Danze 
 Staten Island, said what up, yo 
 The homey ODB said what up, though 
 We got the Chef on deck as if you didn't know 
 It's sharp as fuck, Wu, that's what up 
 Pack it up, wanna rap, wanna rock, what up? 
 Wanna pop, get up, fuck around and get your block hit up 
 Bring your team and we'll box 'em up, think MOP is not what up 
 It seems I'm a bit late here 
 Don't worry, these men are all gonna die 
 See from the side where it slum at, dum at, rum at 
 Cognac, combat, contact, contrast 
 Crom's packing out like Beyonce back 
 She bang out a song like the Fonz back 
 Bigger things, bring the slangs, slicker than the sharpest pen 
 Nigga here, combat, sweet dick Willie T, Rudy Ray Moore game 
 Woodgrain all in the board reigns, before rain flooded 
 Like storm drains, boss man, bundling raw 'caine 
 Fours bang, neighborhood war games 
 Get your weight up, you looking anorexic 
 Posted on the block proper with the hammer vested 
 Bitch came with empty hands, that's the hand she left with 
 Thirsty ass with the water and it sounded desperate 
 Break a white an hour, based it forty grand invested 
 Live within the third rail, you know the man electric 
 Shit was like the third world until I handle metrics, that next shit
