Intro: Blue Raspberry 
 Summer's dream inside 
 Of how I'm gonna get mine 
 I'm thinkin' bout so many ways 
 Of how to conquer these rainy days... 
 (You sang beautifully just now) 
 (I sang for him, and he isn't here) 
 It's going down man, word man 
 Sup black? 
 Niggaz is fuckin' around my gate man 
 Word? 
 Fuck em... yo, I'ma murder somebody man 
 For real I ain't playin' 
 Whatever whatever... 
 Chorus: Blue Raspberry 
 It's raining, he's changing 
 My man is going insane 
 Insane... 
 The war is on, yo 
 Verse One: Ghostface Killer 
 On rainy dayz I sit back and count ways on 
 How to get rich son, show and prove, ask my blitz 
 Stood up late nights, build with my a-lias 
 We can pull a heist, snatch ice or rock mics 
 But this rap shit, got me wanna clack back the latch 
 How it goes Leon, pesos made from scratch 
 But in due time, soon to get mine like Bugsy 
 Heavy on the wrist, Polo mock socks and rugbies 
 Old flicks remind me of Gucci's, pack 'em in your square 
 And little macks milk, blast the year 
 That was Bill Bill, fast forward, ninety-four 
 Who got the bad base? Filthiest fiends scream for more 
 Bless me out of state, howdy Jake's, Starks is back 
 Niggaz want work, now I pull back off a G-Pack 
 Coke rocks, fled to co-ops livin' gossip 
 Them big lip niggaz singin' to cops need to box it 
 Stop it, the projects overflooded with slow leaks 
 The fiends get, new faces get wrapped in sheets 
 I gotta get mine, like my old Earth, bless the cheese blind 
 Sippin on fine wine, the power of the blacks refined 
 (Raining) 
 Devine 
 Waiting on these raw teats takes too long 
 It's like waiting on babies, it makes me want to slay thee 
 But that's ungodly, so yo God, pardon me 
 I need it real quick, the dope flow like penmanship 
 Many heads get pistol-whipped, I blow spots like horse shit 
 So now, talk, shit, nigga, what?? 
 Chorus: Blue Raspberry 
 It's raining, he's changing 
 My man is going insane 
 Insane... 
 Past sunlight, more gunfight 
 Verse Two: Raekwon the Chef 
 ...Time to get the feeling, word up 
 What brings rain hail snow and earthquakes 
 The beat breaks, cause all my niggaz to break son 
 Styles is similar to criminals locked up 
 With gats, ghetto tabernacles is fucked up 
 I live once though the mind stays infinite 
 Travel in the church, nine planets, in my midst 
 While I carry, to earn a decent salary 
 Soon get married, raise a family, but the plan'll be 
 Real great, to sit up in the loft, count stacks and macs 
 And real cats cold watch my back 
 But listen to the Wu son, and maintain it's all real, 
 Starvin individuals kill 
 I puff what's only right, leave the poison alone 
 Projects, infested with rats, cats and crack homes 
 Half of us'll try to make it, the other half'll try to take it 
 So many fake half real freedom-ville 
 Born to science my alliance analyzes 
 Wild surprises, keepin' my eyes wide to this 
 The unfortunate, layin in mountains countin' 
 With jewelry on, can it be the next team house the horn 
 Chill Dunn, just for real ones, light the lye up 
 I hate to have to tie the next guy up 
 Pay attention to Tims ten ways, Wu blends 
 Now I'm starin' you, the true buckle up, now who's a legend? 
 Chorus: Blue Raspberry, Raekwon the Chef 
 It's raining, he's changing 
 Word up Dunn 
 It's raining, he's changing 
 Peace to Philly, VA, these days 
 My man is going insane 
 Word up y'all 
 My man is going insane 
 Word up 
 Insane 
 The sun moon and stars 
 Fly cars, word up y'all 
 No sunlight, more gun fights 
 I've lost him to the street life 
 Street life 
 No cash flow, no more dough 
 He's someone I don't even know 
 Someone I don't know 
 Rainy Dayz... 
 Gettin' through those rainy dayz 
 Gettin' through those rainy dayz 
 Gettin' through those rainy dayz 
 Gettin' through those rainy dayz 
 I lost him to the street life 
 The street life, whoa
