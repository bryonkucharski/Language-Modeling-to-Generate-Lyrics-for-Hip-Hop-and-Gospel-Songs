(Intro: Raekwon) 
 Yeah, come on, man, aw shit 
 It's that fly diabolical, come on 
 Let's go Ra, come on 
 I got to tell 'em, man, I got to tell 'em 
 Based on a true story, y'all 
 Yeah... prophets, nigga, prophet 
 (Chorus: Raheem DeVaughn) 
 From the Hills of the Shaolin 
 All the Wu-Tang came, from far and wide 
 From the Hills, of the Shaolin 
 With an iron fist of fury and a mighty sword 
 To fulfill the prophecy of the Wu-Tang, of the Wu-Tang 
 (Verse 1: Raekwon) 
 In the Polo store, fronting in war clothes, it been like this 
 From right in time when I was nine years old 
 I was a hot mess, smoking cheeba, running with stolen speakers 
 Dropped beepers, even wore a victory vest 
 I run with niggas, digging knots from niggas, running out the school 
 Stunting, back of the bus, flashing the ox 
 Rock the V-Gooses, everything we wore was name brand 
 Sold three looseys, just to get on call plan 
 R.E.C. Poss' Rockers, the Blip Brothers 
 Even the Spin Doctors, sat and smoke blunts, I been bopping 
 All my kins blew up, we grew up with 
 We used to do what? Running through the sewers and then shopping 
 Pick pocket, deuce baby, take it in truce, baby 
 You know how we do, come run in my boots, baby 
 The niggas came through, touch the God, here Shallah 
 Ever since went from ninjas to gem stars, sing Ra 
 (Chorus: Raheem DeVaughn) 
 From the Hills of the Shaolin 
 All the Wu-Tang came, from far and wide 
 From the Hills, of the Shaolin 
 With an iron fist of fury and a mighty sword 
 To fulfill the prophecy of the Wu-Tang, of the Wu-Tang 
 (Verse 2: Method Man) 
 Reunited, another LP, we're all excited 
 That reckless eyeballing will get your girl indicted 
 My touch like Midas, I cramp your style, arthritis 
 These niggas is food, I eat they food, nigga-ritis 
 Your man don't snooze, insomniac 
 This The W, the Clan don't lose, you putting hands on who? 
 Hands down, I can handle you, you half man, half animals 
 If you are what you eat, and eat pussy, you's a cannibal 
 And stopping me, is what you cannot do 
 Either get in the game, get out the way, or get ran right through 
 I ain't different Method Man like you 
 But you ain't like us, we play rough, my community tough 
 And little kids in my community cuss 
 Y'all be showing your guns, but the ones in my community bust 
 And when they do, you give the jewelry up 
 (Chorus: Raheem DeVaughn) 
 From the Hills of the Shaolin 
 All the Wu-Tang came, from far and wide 
 From the Hills, of the Shaolin 
 With an iron fist of fury and a mighty sword 
 To fulfill the prophecy of the Wu-Tang, of the Wu-Tang 
 (Outro: Raekwon) 
 All the niggas came through 
 Yeah, from the Hills, Park Hill, Shaolin 
 Stapleton, New Brighton, nigga 
 West Brighton, the Park, nigga 
 Wu-Tang, South Beach, nigga 
 Yeah, muthafucka, yo
