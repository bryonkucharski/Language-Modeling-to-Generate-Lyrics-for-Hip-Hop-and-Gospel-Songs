Raekwon: 
 Pull out the red carpet, faggot, rap, I live it, mass digits 
 Monkey suit, swinging on a dime jean chunky blue 
 All nines Al Qade it, paid up, play it up 
 We demonstate death, then kill you in the stadium 
 Yankee suits on, the boots on, produce juices 
 Spill rugers on you, play the deuce, them boosters on you 
 I'm stealing, everything, diggin' whitey righty 
 With the magnum taught, when you shoot it, nigga, grab 'em 
 It's the Roc For Life Familia, slash, The Vatican 
 Pop cabbages, it's nothing, nigga, kidnap ya managers 
 Fly roller, slang ox holders and cock blowers 
 The Cuban 2's is coming, y'all niggas is done in 
 Y'all niggas is fronting, my niggas is stumping 
 'Cause when y'all wanna get it on, Rae's up and 
 It's something, those are stunting, can't do me nothing 
 I'll take ya bitch, baby boy, then you fuck up in
