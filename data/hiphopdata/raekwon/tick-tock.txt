Rza 
 Razor 
 Execution 
 The devil is a lie 
 You ain't broke bread till you taste the devil's pie 
 They say his laugh sounds like an angel when he cries 
 What better camouflage when the halo's your disguise 
 Them wings don't fly 
 Your traitor is your neighbor 
 At your front porch, and he's handing you your paper 
 Bathrobe on, but the sword's underneath 
 And he wanna see your blood as it pours in the street 
 It's the mark of the beast 
 The meek shall inherit the Earth 
 The weak shall inherit the dirt 
 You each should have perished at birth 
 Still born or aborted 
 Every street tax gotta come with an audit 
 Either your life, or your loved ones 
 Straight razor or a snub-gun 
 From the village where the thugs from 
 Same corner that you copping all your drugs from 
 He a hero, but he unsung 
 I'm the one 
 I'm the one 
 Ayo homie, the chambers is 36, they new and improved 
 Now make a move 
 These guns whistle, sizzle up dudes who got big mouths, no power 
 Run in the bank with no dollars, got the nerve to switch crews 
 We better than the rest of 'em, my guess is the estrogen 
 And all the money we got, remove like the Mexicans 
 A cartel, compound, a carvel, a large scale in Scarsdale 
 I fuck with golf now, Shala is ill 
 Yeah, the coke is fresh, straight out of Bermuda yo 
 Or chilling on a beach in Boca, cheefin' with tuna 
 Salads and palaces, yo, we smoke out them chalices 
 Passing of the balances of bread to the Island since 
 1984, the (?) was just more 
 Then we would come trough with rifles rocking Nike boots and war 
 A real nigga's invention that came from a henchman 
 Who blew up, now throw the Wu up, that's my redemption 
 Drug dealer, been that nigga half my life 
 Drug dealer, been that nigga half my life 
 You niggas talking, but you ain't never seen 'em 
 Imagine being first name basis with the kingpin 
 God, I was Lucifer's neighbor 
 You wouldn't believe some of the things these people do for this paper 
 Moving with the lasers under Rugers 
 Make a move, you make the papers, lose lose situation 
 Sweat or blood, you get to choose what you bathe in 
 The chemists cookwork 
 The runners; footwork 
 The customs took work 
 The soldiers put work in 
 On any of the motherfuckers who fucked up good work 
 Bosses tell 'em: 'Good work' 
 That's just how the hood work 
 Northface bubble with, eight bundles under it 
 Gold front upper-lip smile while I was hugging it 
 I lied, I wasn't Lucifer's neighbor, he who I'm fucking with 
 My moms threw that snow in her nose, but I would hustle it 
 Champ hoodie, Mongoose with the bags 
 Clap your stoop up, hit moms duke in her legs 
 That's beef, y'all ain't street 
 Y'all peep, write it down and try to beat 
 Fucking everything, neck heavy swing 
 Second hand swepped across that pretty breathling 
 And then that Nissan, Honda, Chevy thing pendling 
 Whatever bring fetti in, steadily I fed my whole team 
 Drug dealer, been that nigga half my life 
 Drug dealer, been that nigga half my life 
 You niggas talking, but you ain't never seen 'em 
 Imagine being first name basis with the kingpin 
 In this art of war, my pen stroke is Picasso 
 To get the picture I ain't got to paint the nostrils 
 You know my origins is over when 
 Fat black bitch singing over organs 
 Die for a dollar, pride you don't swallow 
 You say that for the one you buying red bottoms 
 Yeah, that's the price you gotta pay for it 
 All's fair in love and war, she masquerade for it 
 Woo! Jack-O-Lantern Push 
 Trick or treat (?), I earned it of the books 
 Now listen to me vent 
 When you sitting watch, it's like the tires being spent 
 Shots from everywhere, but they never make a dent 
 Knight in shining armor 
 Mistake me for the villain cause of my vengeance is your karma 
 Yeah, fear is knowing you're a goner 
 This is music to my soul, 'cause it's death before dishonor 
 Gone 
 Check! 
 Got the Tongue of a Pimp 
 Raised by a dirty preacher 
 That used the church money to cop a new Beamer 
 Got the heart of a child raised by a prostitute 
 That bought his momma the rubbers when a job came through 
 It's the microphone Methadone 
 Greatest ever etched in stone 
 You ain't getting pussy like your prom date had a chaperone 
 Popping pills got a nigga brain like a labyrinth 
 Called the ho on purpose 
 But I got the brain on accident 
 Nigga I'm your majesty 
 Show up with a bag of weed 
 Rolled a blunt so perfect, thought it came up out a factory 
 My manuscript leave a man ripped of all his dreams 
 The insomniac with nightmares in sixteens 
 I'm a wet dream, Dry sense of humor 
 Travel in Class like a high school rumor 
 No one really cares if you embarrass us with style 
 Cuzz when it comes to them raps you been letting us down 
 So tell 'em why your mad son 
 Gotta get it off your chest 
 Let 'em know how you feel son 
 You gotta say what you say 
 It don't matter, they gonna say a nigga hating anyway
