Chorus: (Superb) 
 If you don't stand for this life you fall for anything 
 I stand for Cream Team, see we plan our dreams 
 Shit ain't a game, we don't run game, we run businesses 
 Watch us shine and watch the World be our witnesses 
 (Repeat) 
 Verse 1: (Raekwon) 
 Observe real though 
 Half cieling of blow 
 Rhymin' Deniro dough 
 Dundalero yo 
 Let the steel blow 
 Hear me yo, wild trump style 
 Dons connect three hundred ones wow 
 Floatin' like a maccarel, that's foul 
 Most craziest, laziest 
 All eye seein', blaze this majorness 
 Mechanic record on a beige disc 
 Pain, whatever level bankrolls 
 Frequent plain clothes 
 Lex spit six, arrange those 
 Snot nose pros 
 Dark skin hoes 
 Crazy ill fly jersey Expos 
 Neck froze 
 Fuck your set, slash vetos 
 Still Lex knows 
 Gasoline jumper on with the most fly livest Gortex made in Mexico 
 Bricks Fifteen Five 
 Celine Dion ties 
 Two Thousand dollar bubble eyes 
 Yo, the theme cries 
 Rollin' for cream yo now watch the laser beam rise 
 Sling pies 
 Doin' our thing high. 
 Verse 2: (Baby Thad) 
 The chain of command is effective immediately, the cause and effect 
 It calls for your death 
 Black suburbans at night with no lights ram you off Hollywood Hills 
 Tearin' off the doors to your Lex 
 Steel Magnolia 
 Fear is takin' over ya 
 If you ain't bowlin' we rollin' straight over ya 
 If you ain't real about it don't talk 
 Hollow clips evict you, set supper for the Hawks 
 Send a missile at your ear like (whizz whizz) "what was it?" 
 Buzz the buzzers 
 Blow past with clutch buckets 
 They'd rather not see you in Malibu eatin' veal 
 Strength recognize strength, real recognize real. 
 Verse 3: (Chip Banks) 
 It ain't a game dick 
 You know us, European whips 
 Chain frost bit 
 Peter pay Paul now pay the boss kid 
 Heavens the stakes are now even 
 Sent the heat rash to your camp, left his shirt there now you barely 
 Breathin' 
 Slow leakin' 
 Look at your people weepin' 
 I ain't have to quickdraw Mcgraw you I could Fifty Two block you 
 Switch my stance up Southpaw, drop you 
 You got small digits, your riches is midgets to mine 
 You sip Ballantine, I'm crown Royale 
 Sit back laughin' while y'all plans foyale 
 Y'all funny style, you'll never make it to trial 
 It ain't a game kid. 
 Verse 4: (Rhyme Recca) 
 World premier, metal gear 
 Fanfare, stand clear 
 All jokes aside, this is our year 
 Still here for real y'all, bare witness 
 This is business 
 NewYork City's sickness 
 Simple street principle 
 Cream team invincible 
 Money interchangeable 
 Bulletproof Benzes 
 Ralph Lauren lenses 
 Soldiers in the trenches 
 Expansion 
 Four car garage, mini-mansion 
 Consolidated regiment 
 Connects like the President 
 Excellent 
 Rock waves with Three Sixty measurements 
 Chrome rims, new timbs 
 Exotic chains with red gems 
 Real estate 
 Corporation mindstate 
 Prosperity 
 Dealin' with the highest of integrity 
 Steadily, wall street bound 
 Walkin' on Holy ground 
 Give is the greatest of all, I spread my love around 
 Young black multi, this ain't a game son, we run businesses. 
 Verse 5 (Rza) 
 I burst like a sea crackin' through the earth, 
 Flower blossomin' 
 For your rhyme sickness spittin' anti-toxin 
 Best merk 
 Get your neck jerked 
 Dynamic mic teck squirt 
 Lyrics splurt blast the expert 
 To his head till his legs hurt 
 Knees become wobbly 
 King got love-love, born equal equality 
 Bring bodily harm, probably bust a brain artery 
 Kidnap the track 
 I could rap to the high hats 
 My widescreen imax lyric spread until the climax 
 Wu instrumental breaks scratch past the aftertake 
 Live performance concert, make shorty wop masturbate 
 In the tub legs open water be rushin' from the faucet 
 Thinkin' about the Wu-Tang gang bang she almost lost it 
 I move from the blood marked turf 
 Where the heart hurts 
 And merk to the heavily refined hills where the God lurks 
 Everyday I'm countin' 
 Son, my thoughts can move a mountain 
 So much joy in his eyes he'll make you cry a fountain 
 You purse snatch while I earth snatch and take the earth back 
 Have you runnin' like Devils bein' chased by the church
