Intro: Raekwon, Ghostface 
 Yo what what, yo 
 Exotic type shit 
 Ninety-four, we must go to war fast 
 With the pen and the pad 
 God damn, shine like gold rims on Pathfinders 
 Wu-Tang reclines, lamps, for the nine-squares kid 
 Money clothes designer hoes and shows y'all 
 Lyrics: Raekwon, Ghostface 
 Yo, yo, wakin' up about ten kid 
 Jumpin' in the shower, peace about to make 
 Moves and slide like greese 
 What? I'm all about Tecs and checks and nuff respect you front 
 I'm slammin' you like the Lex 
 So now I'm out in the ninety-five 
 Rockin' that real nigga don't die 
 Guess down 
 Drawers Kani! 
 But yo I'm makin' a pit stop 
 Go and buy a box of glocks, till he rolled up and yo 
 Whattup Hobbes? 
 Yo, remember that kid that we vicked 
 He made a half of mil for real 
 He brought about fo' bricks 
 Yo, so now we connect doors, meet me at the airport 
 Tell golden arms maintain the fort 
 Get in touch with that West coast Cali crab you stabbed 
 And meet me at the bitch lab 
 So word up kid, we slid like a fat four to twelve bid and shit 
 Couldn't even rest, I need the vic 
 And when I slept, I dream G's, Son I need some 
 Keys roll self, call up Son 
 I heard Pook and Tyriq caught a beef over some real shit 
 A fake nigga faked and they killed his click 
 Gimme a minute and I'm with it 
 Yo niggaz done did it 
 Rock your vest 
 Keep your whip tinted 
 So now we see him up in BoJangles 
 Stranglin a forty ounce, with ten G's worth of gold bangles 
 Diamonds, what, all up in his face 
 With his man's mace, medallions the size of dinner plates 
 Yo, he knew we knew him so we blew him 
 Took thirty G's worth of jewels of that nigga 
 Do him! 
 So now I'm lampin in my man's Land 
 Streets is hot like sand 
 Jesus rollin' in my right hand 
 Yup, you know the steezo black 
 Got to go down like that 
 Shallah 
 Cigars 
 And ball hats 
 Ninety-four, takin' niggaz to war, yo, yo 
 What do you believe in? Heaven or hell? 
 You don't believe in heaven 'cause we're livin' in hell 
 (Repeat 2X) 
 So it's your life 
 *We're livin' in hell, we're livin' in hellllllll* 
 What a chamber, fuckin' with mad strangers 
 Yeah, you know how it runs baby, straight up yo 
 Money clothes, designer hoes and shows y'all 
 That's how it goes 
 Whatever 
 What do you believe in? Heaven or hell? 
 You don't believe in heaven 'cause we're livin' in hell 
 31st chamber y'all 
 So it's your life 
 (What do you believe in? Heaven or hell?) 
 Niggaz ain't even know Son, only half is sewed cash 
 (You don't believe in heaven 'cause we're livin' in hell) 
 They haven't yet sold their weight 
 (What do you believe in? Heaven or hell?) 
 Question, shit is real, youknowhatI'msayin 
 (You don't believe...) 
 Niggaz think it's all about a real live Allah 
 A little hundred dollars and that make you a man 
 KnowhatI'msayin? 
 You ain't even promised tomorrow Son, word up 
 Niggaz don't understand how life can be so short 
 Come so fast 
 With the blinkin of eye, blinkin of eye you're gone baby

 Return to the casket

 Heartbroken, we soakin wet though
