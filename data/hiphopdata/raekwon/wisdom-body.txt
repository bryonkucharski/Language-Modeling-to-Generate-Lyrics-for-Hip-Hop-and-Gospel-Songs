Intro: The Mack 
 No man all bitches are the same, just like my hoes, you know 
 I keep 'em broke 
 Wake up one morning with some money they're subject to go crazy you know? 
 I keep 'em lookin' good, pretty and all that 
 You know, but no dough 
 When I get a bitch, I got a bitch (right on) 
 Lyrics: Ghostface 
 Word up, that motherfuckin brother wise 
 YouknowhatI'msayin? Teachin the uncivilized 
 Yeah, runnin' the streets, know it's deep 
 Word up, check his technique, yeah 
 I be Ghostface 
 Flippin the, marvelous track 
 Yeah 
 You know the steelo, but yo, yo 
 Check the bangin' sounds that I invent 
 Fake niggaz who tried to flex hard came and went 
 They couldn't match up with the fly nigga 
 Wit his back against the wall 
 Heads clapped once I came in the door 
 I played the speaker, sippin on Kahlua 
 Saw this bad bitch wit a switch 
 And yo, I had to step to her in a manner 
 And rather wished the current was warm 
 When I had reached her, I looked and knew the shit was on 
 Peace, excuse me, allow to introduce myself 
 Yo, I'm the man, and Honey, you've been rated top shelf 
 Yo, what's your name hon, hair wrapped up in a bun 
 Your eyes sparkle, just like glass in the sun 
 Never diss em, it's hard for a nigga just to miss em 
 Especially, when you're browsin, goin' fishin 
 Your wasteline, bangin' like a bassline 
 Physical form is well complexed 
 And yo, I love your outline, Boo 
 Your whole body is wild, wit your rugged profile 
 Enough to make a hard rock smile 
 You can't strikeout, tell me what can really go wrong 
 You rockin' labels - Tommy Hil down to Claiborne 
 Show me some love hon, show me some love boo 
 Show me the vibe and I'll be more than glad to shoot it through 
 Aiyyo peep it, I know you love Victoria's Secret 
 And lovin' all the marvelous slang on how I freak it 
 Plus, see you're the type to make a nigga crash 
 Far from trash, your flesh is way softer than a baby's ass 
 Your body lotion is the potion, the shit got me open like dust 
 And yo, your stee is high potent, yo 
 We can go the distance, I put you under wings 
 From this convo we can spark and see whatever brings 
 I walked a hot Arabian desert, barefooted 
 I grabbed your hand, you grabbed my joint and knew where to put it 
 Word up, yo, straight up and down yo 
 Check the joint, baby 
 It be the Wu-Tang production 
 Yeah, yeah, and all types of shit 
 And brothas catchin repercussions 
 Yo, straight up
