Heed the battle call, check the catalog 
 Flow so crazy it's adderall with the padded walls 
 More twisted turns in the body that's on the baddest broad 
 These cattle call 'rappers' is weak, my honor matter more 
 Your whole style stiffer than mannequins you see at a store 
 You mannequins are Chante and Kenny, I mean the Latter more 
 No ping pong and we volleying with the back and forth 
 Straight King Kong and the trap we blasting off, son 
 You want Nigerian money, see me in Qatar drunk 
 Waving the K, I can't fake the funk 
 Blessed with the belts, flying in the stealth 
 Jewelry on the neck, diamonds in the Cheals 
 You know I wrestle with pawns, getting my money, we gone 
 The automatic laying player, we Dons 
 You can't see us, the new phenoms, I like the Benz zeons 
 Split your wig like I got three arms 
 I need a fiancé, at least a Beyoncé 
 I know my vision beyond some other shit 
 I'm just as meaty as moms 
 I'm supposed to be on, the greenery gone 
 I'm still the king of the drama 
 Put the Ruger down your throat, eat my Johnson nigga 
 Way they all in their feelings, what's wrong with niggas 
 Forgetting silence is still a response 
 The way the blood paint the wall you can tell he really an artist 
 I get it like Whitey Bulger till rapture, dearly departed 
 We gon' Lex in, my nigga 
 These are blessings, my nigga 
 Keep stressing, my nigga 
 Don't stress, little nigga 
 Eat a clip, little nigga 
 Niggas trip, little nigga 
 Violations we gon' flip, little nigga 
 We gon' Lex in, my nigga 
 These are blessings, my nigga 
 Keep stressing, my nigga 
 Don't stress, little nigga 
 Eat a clip, little nigga 
 Niggas trip, little nigga 
 Violations we gon' flip, little nigga 
 It's the champion flow, the Jordan, LeBron and Kobe 
 The Obi Wan Kenobi, of getting that guap-a-mole 
 We touring overseas, got her fanning out like a Dakota 
 I'm trying to get the check, I'm Martina Navratilova 
 Catch me at the races, gateway at Saratoga 
 They trying to place my face 'cause we mobbing, we taking over 
 My niggas keep it pure while you cut with the baking soda 
 These rappers be stretching the truth like they taking yoga 
 Couch potatoes, now they made us into a vegetable culture 
 A result of division like it's a decimal quotient 
 Do the math, my nigga, do the math 
 You'd never settle for less than the whole if you knew the half 
 Rough as alligator skin getting crazy grip 
 I'm so amazing with words I make a baby spit 
 Resting in Tibet, wild with the Gillette 
 Giraffe long goose on, my boots is [?] 
 Pocket full of coins, producers on set 
 Niggas with the coupes is on next 
 The losers gon' step, the users gon' check 
 We choosing our ninjas, the Jews is on deck 
 Refuse, that's a debt, pool with the steps 
 Everybody see us, the tools is all TECs 
 Anything come through we school, wan' bet? 
 Fuck you gon' tell us? He knew we on next 
 They wanna act like they know me, you don't know me nigga 
 You got the baby boy hustle, you a Jody nigga 
 You wanna swim with the sharks, I'm Chief Brody killin' 
 Get your jaw tapped this is raw rap, come on, yeah 
 We gon' Lex in, my nigga 
 These are blessings, my nigga 
 Keep stressing, my nigga 
 Don't stress, little nigga 
 Eat a clip, little nigga 
 Niggas trip, little nigga 
 Violations we gon' flip, little nigga 
 We gon' Lex in, my nigga 
 These are blessings, my nigga 
 Keep stressing, my nigga 
 Don't stress, little nigga 
 Eat a clip, little nigga 
 Niggas trip, little nigga 
 Violations we gon' flip, little nigga
