(Raekwon) 
 If I ain't rockin' emeralds and Bentleys, I'm coolin' in Poughkeepsie Me, shorty, new Glock 40, and some bent weed 
 Ridin' the married boots, take care of me, sincerely 
 I'm Israeli, machettes is cris, swish some Baileys 
 Snuggled up, mink on, call it a cover up 
 Just like two murders in the hood, I'mma double up 
 The rap surgeon fix the game up, crack merchant 
 Everything I sell is well, my shit is that worthy 
 GATs that come up out the ceiling with the beam on it 
 Chinese Queen, Parasuco jeans on her 
 Rock long jeans, known for throwing blings on her 
 I stay king, by any means scream on it nigga 
 Come on, let's go nigga 
 Word up, close the door to the Aston nigga 
 Yo, get out the, take that shit out the ash tray man 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Do you remember a real gang member? 
 Choppin' till he timber, December to December 
 Never stoppin', too busy poppin' off lead in the heat 
 Clownin' ass all around him, they crown him the Dogg Father 
 Glock hot, crock pot on the block with a chef 
 Out of bounds on the grounds with a hole in your chest 
 Invest in back in feedback, gorilla the west 
 Take a whiff of me, spliff, till it fill up my chest 
 Convertible with the Cadillac, mackin' the mack 
 With some Roscoe's Chicken in my lap, imagine that 
 I'm groovin' down Sunset Boulevard 
 No harm, no foul, no body guard 
 Yo, stop right there man 
 You don't know what you're doin' man 
 Chill, chill, let them handle that man for real 
 (Raekwon) 
 Chill yo, the movie is scary 
 Take off the sheep skin shotty 
 Nigga make a move, and don't dare me 
 I'm blessed with these million dollar hands, I'm like poker 
 Niggas screw they motherfuckin' face, so what? 
 Guns are collected, flips perfected 
 Boats flying in, every brake's inspected 
 The clique's connected, everybody wrist and neck lit 
 Two shots of Cisco, let's slip 
 Post like Scarface and Sosa with my memosa 
 All that motion, see my billiongs posted and roastin' 
 See my villains most of them roastin' 
 Freshmen chickens get close in 'em 
 Make one move, she buyin' me the Ghost in it 
 Pass the dutchie 
 You know what it do man 
 We in Wonderland huh 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Stealth but get loud like a space shuttle 
 Catch a case, a motherfuckers got a place for you 
 And it's 100 brothers like you that's cold with the Typhoo 
 Slang and things and buck 50 with the jinzu 
 Draw that line, flip that dime, spit that nine 
 Homie this Crip on mine 
 Thought you knew 
 We cold crushin' bum rush the chef, it's my nephew 
 The king of the west too, niggas to test you 
 Let your next move be your best move 
 Ja bless you 
 1,2 1,2 what you gone do when we come through?
