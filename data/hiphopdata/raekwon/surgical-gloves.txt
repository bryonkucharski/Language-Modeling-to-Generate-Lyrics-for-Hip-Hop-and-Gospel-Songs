Eight million stories, nigga 
 Take y'all niggas somewhere, man 
 Y'all niggas never heard niggas rhyme like this before, man 
 This ain't no Wizard of Oz shit neither, man 
 For real, man, aiyo 
 Surgical gloves, snubs in the grass with his blood 
 Homey hold that, the four black, we black down 
 Gold Jag', Ol' laughing yo, yo, what the fuck happened? 
 They clapped him and the scalp it flew that way 
 Yo why they capped him? It went through his lap 
 Snatched his Audemars Piguet, took his mango, get at 
 He painted it, slayed blocks, aiming it 
 Hit a child, this is foul, but he styled with his flamer flaming shit 
 Teddy with the red Range, supercharged Kangols 
 Rae and Ghost CD in his change, yo, Angel 
 Spanish kid lingo, all I know is where he hang though, kept it sideways, angle 
 Good brush, tough talk, keep it real, daddy, got them thangos 
 I respect on how the game goes, the same goes 
 Forget fresh niggas, test niggas, extra bless niggas, with them egos 
 We blow you out your peacoats 
 Haha, adios mios, we get them twelve a ki, yo 
 Keep it moving, slide off in the G.O.'s 
 Freeloaders, the D's over, your shit won't sell no more 
 Breeze over 
 Money, gear, drugs, guns, Goodyears 
 All my niggas sit, smelling the tears 
 Cookin snow white, it's just the poor life, never living off fear 
 We all millionaires, now where my shares? 
 (Money) You know the code, drug money, gear money, baby 
 (Money) You know we fold the stash holders, cash blowers, yeah 
 (Money) So when the D's come, we float and grab the boats, yeah 
 (Money) Spend off, I got my win off, have a potent year 
 X6's red, up in Albany with the dreds 
 Bags of black, fuck the feds 
 Papers in Aruba's, gold tuba from Bermuda 
 In my living room spreads, cameras action, got the calico cranked 
 Where the food at? Hood jewelry on, I gots to do that 
 Long chain hatchet flooded up, you knew that 
 Baby blue mack, stones on the nozzle stick 
 Bulletproof brocco's with the Jew bitches, all I got is two cracks 
 Gazelle lenses, clear rude wraps, bagging every ziplock 
 And my peoples sit around, cops split that 
 High potent white kit kats, we sell up in the hood 
 Going door to door, every floor, every get back 
 My gangsta shit, get gats, for every man, here go a gram 
 Meet me by my drop head and drop your lip back 
 Forty-seven quick claps, spray off on something 
 Spray on one of y'all man, the streets is mine, nigga 
 You know what we do, for real 
 Straight up, it's how we playing right now, man 
 'Cause the streets, man, streets is making y'all niggas see, man 
 But some of y'all is blind, for real
