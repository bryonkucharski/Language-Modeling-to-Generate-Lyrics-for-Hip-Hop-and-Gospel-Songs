Where is he? 
 Concentrating on the job 
 Don't disturb the Doctor 
 Yeah 
 Word up 
 Who said we ain't the definition of exclusive shit? 
 Real rap, you know? 
 Yeah, this is multi-expensive rap here brother 
 Word up 
 Time to recreate the power 
 You know what it is man 
 Nothing but gangsta shit baby 
 Let's go Doc I need that prescription 
 Ey yo (ey yo) 
 (Verse 1 Raekwon The Chef) 
 I grew up on the foul side 
 Nickel-bag valcyte 
 Purple tops, two for fives 
 I had seven grams 
 Outside with my eleven man's 
 On the corners with a pocket full of contrabands 
 Running up and down fire-escapes, narcs coming 
 Jump in the window let your Nikes fly, hide the flakes 
 Guess up in the hill it was real to me 
 What a nigga woulda did if you steal from me 
 All my life around drug niggas villains who want millions 
 Niggas with them hoodies on with teks in the building 
 Mad fiends, bags and green, Gillette razors, fly neighbors 
 All our blazers designer jeans 
 That's why we live (yup) 
 Niggas need shit in their crib 
 Go broke, you go and rope you a Vick 
 It's just full-time stragglers 
 Niggas try to take your place 
 And smile in your face 
 But still in all backstabbers 
 (Chorus Lyfe Jennings) 
 I'm just trying to get on 
 Leave a couple mil to my kids when I'm gone 
 And nigga that ain't cologne 
 It's the smell of this money 
 I'm just trying to get home 
 'Cause I don't know when my karma gonna catch up 
 I don't know when the toilet gonna back up 
 And put me in some shit that I can't get out of 
 (Verse 2 Raekwon The Chef) 
 Come on 
 Bags of money 
 Trying to stay rich and fly 
 Keep it cool, silks and dungarees 
 Krug glasses and food 
 Grilled salmon, trying to make a move 
 Those who knowing they be dapping they dudes 
 How it do blow a lot of crews stay in the cut 
 Pacing from here to LA and Hawaii and Cuba 
 Blue new oozie too serial numbers is braille 
 So when you rub against it feel on (?) 
 Now I'm with some special niggas, next level niggas 
 With rubber bezels who drive Exeleros with jewels 
 (?) Boots on, olive goose, calamari soups 
 And noodles that spell out "Y'all niggas the truth" 
 What it is baby boy, reclining in a big Benz lazyboy 
 Endsed up, lenses on, Chips Ahoy 
 Shipping triple, niggas try to stop the issue 
 And cock-block but can't stop the official 
 (Chorus Lyfe Jennings) 
 I'm just trying to get on 
 Leave a couple mil to my kids when I'm gone 
 And nigga that ain't cologne 
 It's the smell of this money 
 I'm just trying to get home 
 'Cause I don't know when my karma gonna catch up 
 I don't know when the toilet gonna bck up 
 And put me in some shit that I can't get out of
