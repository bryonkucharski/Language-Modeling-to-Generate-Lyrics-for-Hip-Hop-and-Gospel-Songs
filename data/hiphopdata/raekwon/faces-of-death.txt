Last time they saw this movie 
 It was on regular screens 
 We ain't had no HD 
 No Imax 
 Now we got 3D goggles to watch this shit 
 Popcorn extra buttery 
 Extra sauce, 2 on that 
 Okay 
 He just buckin' out in broad daylight 
 Started from play fights 
 Niggas slap box and then you stop like a break light 
 I rock a Rolex but never got my time straight 
 I can't see shit something like a blind date 
 Pyrex vision, hologram cocaine 
 And when I gas niggas I call it propane 
 I used to hustle with the peeps under the boxers 
 And my little pocket stash, allin top rockers 
 And weed up for my dude Made Enrique 
 He also uptown but he live out in BK 
 Used to say DK, Diablo, papo 
 Partners with Pablo, heroin, italiano 
 Flush the work, overseas gots the work 
 Yellow Lambo, used to let it off like Rambo 
 Sambo consignin, he's wheels need aligning 
 How the fuck you gonna go to war with a boss 
 With your paper in your right 
 And your crew hat's off 
 Smirnoff whackin shots, vacant lot parking lots 
 Sour with the scritorillo, nigga I don't care to be 
 Seat nigga like toilets, fuck it I'm a shit a bit 
 Ready or not, here I come 
 Red berry Siroc, red dots on em 
 Marvin Gaye, know you heard through the grape vine 
 That dope getting stepped on, great one 
 Everything you did I did every time 
 Let the fountains fly like the anytime 
 Man I never thought I'd really make it 
 You see me do some space on my pillow case 
 With them doors on, point the goal and 
 Your bitch gon' swallow, we with no head 
 Montana shit, I been on the first track 
 Getting all this head and I ain't learned yet 
 Pimpin' them hoes, 6 in the yacht 
 Dippin' the Rolls, your bitch in the back 
 Uh, word to pong, I'm clappin' off 
 Catch you in the 'ap fore you turn your burnies off the saw 
 You goin' in the back, straight off the back 
 Peoples actin' crazy, hit 'em with the mack 
 Pull out the Jag, cause that's what all they had 
 Up here in the streets you know the goons parasite 
 N.O.R.E. we deep in this bitch 
 SP rockin' in the streets in this bitch 
 Middle fingers up, you don't really give a fuck 
 Niggas is tryna hustle just to make a fuckin' buck 
 Just to make a fuckin' buck, just to make a fuckin' buck 
 Niggas let you down just to make a fuckin' buck 
 Aye, it's real out there, it's real out there 
 Them haters think you killed out there, killed out there 
 Man you a liar, set your house on fire 
 Ain't nothing man, I think you wear a wire 
 Hang him off the roof with a noose 
 Goddamn it and let the goons loose 
 Golden monk drunk, how they take pieces of gold? 
 Shave a nigga face, machete niggas quake 
 Indoors with whores, they soldiers 
 How at they go? We gon poke kill fly ride and roll 
 The most insane destroying grocers 
 With more back, it's scoliosis 
 Yo I'm runs in frontin', land best pull in shore 
 With the red clock on, no question 
 Build for the reserves, I just swerve laughin', I'm usually around birds 
 Not since once one strapped in 
 All at a time, mackin' a lap on my dime 
 I just advise niggas, stay on your grind 
 4-50 game, never nigga what 
 I'm shutted most better, we will sever your son 
 Out the slum with the vultures, dinosaur chains and roadsters 
 Don't come around, we approaches 
 See when I come through, I never fear 
 You got em 
 I'm like a sniper with a riffle 
 Even my hood get it bad 
 Look, deeper than them lost troubles and badge 
 I'm walkin' through a lane full of riches 
 You see all of these diamonds drippin' off it 
 And you get to pourin' wine in my glass 
 Havin' a seat and listen to science 
 Odometers sparkling, glisten off me 
 We ball until they call police and they tryna report me 
 We washin' all his brand like a nigga doing the laundry 
 See a nigga tryna chill while you niggas tryin' to force me 
 Bitches cleanin' my ratchets, I'm a get to blammin' 'em shortly 
 Where the fuck you tryna step up like you some kind of contendant 
 You's a bitch, reminding me of some kind of a sex offender 
 I'll burn you to a crisp, leaving nothing more than your digit 
 You hear the family bitch, I inherit the name defending 
 Nothing's surprising bout niggas like you up on a stretcher 
 And squeeze until they leak, it's all like applying the pressure, pause 
 You probably should went in higher you will protect the cause 
 Ban it from TV set, but a movie don't wreck the boss
