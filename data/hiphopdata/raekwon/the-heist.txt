(Raekwon) 
 Straight up nigga, I'm a money nigga man 
 You know what time it is wit me, yo 
 That's right 
 Take the track, cut the heads off, split it down the middle man 
 Take the bones out man for real 
 Yeah all apple pie yeah 
 Straight up, Flipmode BK king 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 It was the best heist since ice 
 Precise rituals 
 Skated outta Jacob's wit the Fruit Loop jewels 
 Holding a navy blue uzi 
 Krush Grooving waves off the atlas 
 Cooling, that's how we make movies 
 Basketball gun brawlers, bounce 
 Black down 'bill-a-head banks, Malibu colorful shanks 
 That's the way we live, Staten Island kid 
 Old dog in it, the thug vaccine wit no pork in it 
 Vivid imagination paper chasing 
 Dufflebag swollen, we holding 
 Drink chocolate milk before we roll in 
 It's like that y'all, we gangstas 
 Sticking all you Bay Ridge Benzes 
 I'm out to get erect, terrific shit be the diamond district 
 Tiffany's, pretty Valentine brick is on the second floor balcony 
 Gems is magnificent, diamonds is crying 
 "Busta Rhymes take me, never mind help!" 
 (Raekwon) 
 Hey yo caught 'em at the ice pavilion 
 Dressy, salad bar style Nestle 
 Four white niggas, covered in vest pieces 
 Think like a mob flick 
 Guessing like Patsy in the mask, piece bust 
 Got aggravated, slapped the glass piece 
 One nigga beaming, fagot ass 
 Lay on the floor ya fuck! 
 Tied his broken arm to his Hush Puppies 
 Wrapped around trauma, everything realer than fuck 
 Tajuana left my nigga niece live comma 
 Three young Italians, suited down personal style 
 I'm in valour white designing on the 'dallions 
 Felt like some crackers was in back of me 
 Spit on the clerk, pass the Harry Winston set 
 Ghost backing me 
 Bust a shot, motored 
 Four male in paper work Lord 
 We get together once more before we blow this 
 Murdered nobody 
 Left 'em all baseball'd down, brother 
 Three wicked ass 6's, Gucci colors 
 (Busta Rhymes) 
 Money! Drop dead on the floor 
 Nigga, pass the keys to the door 
 Pass me all the cash in the drawer 
 Or I promise you'll be payin' the price 
 Feeling like a nigga died twice 
 Execute the world's greatest diamond heist 
 Y'all niggas know we out to get this money! 
 See'mon money! [Repeat: x7] 
 Raekwon, Ghostface, Rocky Marce see'MON! 
 Let's get this money nigga 
 (Rocky Marciano) 
 Yeah we ?near the mind? out west 
 Somewhere in Africa 
 The Feds is after us, vest on my back 
 Whipping the Acuras, feel like a mac busting 
 A rug in Preston on percussion 
 I'll bust in your gate, nigga it's nothing 
 A hail storm, ice raining, mind containing 
 Info, nigga what you in for? Complaining 
 Sick bars deep in this language 
 Did I tell you how my day's spent? 
 Speaking through the face of Ronald Regan 
 Iceberg History, calligraphy 
 Colidescope colors, hollow-head shells and flaring gunmen 
 Hate to see me coming like gray skies on day of judgment 
 Makes you wonder where the love went 
 Hit a nigga, feed him to some buzzards 
 Put up numbers, plus I'm one to push his mug in 
 We duck in the safe, check what I'm hugging 
 Rocks the size of some shit, out in the congo 
 My arms full, let's get the fuck out, Busta I got you 
 (Busta Rhymes) 
 Hey yo we do great study on fossils and stones like archeologists 
 Gem-ologists, collect the most priceless ices anonymous 
 Canary stones yellow like a pumpkin 
 Dunking Donut precious size stones make me want to cut the safe open 
 Rae pass the blowtorch, Ghost brought the dynamite stick 
 Marciano brought a chisel wit an ice pick 
 Princess cuts, invisible settings 
 Planning the world's greatest diamond heist playin' a tune by Otis Redding 
 Icicle cones hang from the ceiling just like stalagmites 
 Time to throw on a skully and tying a rag tight 
 Throwing light went off and in the basket 
 Grabbed the necklace from off the satin pillow while the glass casket 
 Ice lay across the crushed burgandy velvet 
 Up in the diamond slide-tray 
 Gun in your face, slide it right away 
 Roundtable with Habib, Mirishnokof, and the rest of them Jewish niggas 
 We got them niggas drunk and talking foolish see 
 You know the way we straight manipulated the shit 
 We swindle them niggas for all their precious things before we skated and shit 
 Yeah, y'all niggas know we skated early 
 Disguised ourselves as the cidic Jews and even left my sideburns curly 
 Bounce to Mexico and spend some pesos 
 And bury the diamonds on an island your never heard 
 Like Turks in Keikos 
 Everytime we hit, we in and out quick 
 Don't be surprised if we behind supplying niggas all the platinum and shit 
 Money [Repeats] 
 Yeah, the world's greatest jewel heist 
 Thoroughly and successfully executed 
 By none other than Ghostface Killah, Raekwon the Chef 
 Rock Marciano and Busta Rhymes 
 A job well done fellas, very good piece of work
