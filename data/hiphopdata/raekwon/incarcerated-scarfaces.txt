Intro: (LP Version) 
 He looks determined without being ruthless 
 Something heroic in this man, there's a courage about him 
 Doesn't look like a killer 
 Comes across so calm, acts like he has a dream 
 Full of passion 
 You don't trust me, huh? 
 Well you know why 
 I do, we're not supposed to trust anyone in our profession anyway 
 Raekwon the Chef 
 Knock niggaz out the box all the time 
 Bitches on my motherfuckin records Pah 
 Big ones, yeah, big fuckers 
 Straight up, fuck your whole team 
 Yeah bust it 
 Yo, yo, fly G.I. niggaz 
 Now yo yo, whattup yo, time is runnin' out 
 It's for real though, let's connect politic - ditto 
 We could trade places, get lifted in the staircases 
 Word up, peace incarcerated scarfaces 
 Thug related style attract millions Fans 
 They understand my plan, who's the kid up in the green Land? 
 Me and the RZA connect, blow a fuse, you lose 
 Half-ass crews get demolished and bruised 
 Fake be frontin, hourglass heads niggaz be wantin 
 Shuttin down your slot; time for pumpin 
 Poisonous sting which thumps up and act chumps 
 Raise a heavy generator, but yo, guess who's the black Trump? 
 Dough be flowin by the hour's Wu, we got the collars, scholars 
 Word life, peace to power and my whole unit 
 Word up! Quick to set it, don't wet it 
 Real niggas lick shots, peace kinetic Kid 
 Now yo yo, whattup yo, time is runnin' out 
 It's for real though, let's connect politic - ditto 
 We could trade places, get lifted in the staircases 
 Word up, peace incarcerated scarfaces 
 Chef'll shine like marble, rhyme remarkable 
 Real niggaz raise up, spend your money, argue 
 But this time is for the uninvited 
 Go head and rhyme to it, big nigga mics is gettin' fired 
 Morphine chicks be burnin like chlorine 
 Niggaz recognize from here to Baltimore to Fort Greene 
 But hold up, Moet be tastin like throw-up 
 My mob roll up, dripped to death whips rolled up 
 Ya never had no wins, slidin in these dens wit Timbs 
 Wit Mac-10's and broke friends 
 Ya got guns, got guns too, what up son, do 
 You wanna battle for cash and see who Sun too? 
 I probably wax, tax, smack rap niggaz who fax 
 Niggaz lyrics is wack nigga 
 Can't stand unofficial, wet tissue, blank bustin' Scud missles 
 You rollin' like Trump, you get your meat lumped 
 For real, it's just slang rap democracy 
 Here's the policy, slide off the ring, plus the Wallabees 
 Check the status, soon to see me at Caesar's Palace eatin salads 
 We beatin' mics and the keys to Dallas 
 I move rhymes like retail, make sure shit sell 
 From where we at to my man's cell 
 From staircase to stage, minimun wage 
 But soon to get a article in RapPage 
 But all I need is my house, my gat, my Ac 
 Bank account fat - it's goin' down like that 
 And pardon the French but let me speak Italian 
 Black Stallion, dwellin on Shaolin 
 That means the island of Staten 
 And niggaz carry gats and mad police from Manhattan 
 Now yo yo, whattup yo, time is runnin' out 
 It's for real though, let's connect politic - ditto 
 We could trade places, get lifted in the staircases 
 Word up, peace incarcerated scarfaces 
 I do this for barber shop niggaz in the Plaza 
 Catchin asthma, Rae is stickin gun-flashers 
 Well-dressed, skatin through the projects wit big ones 
 Broke elevators, turn the lights out, stick one 
 Upstairs, switch like a chameleon, Hip Brazilians 
 Pass the cash or leave your children, leave the buildin 
 Niggas, yo they be foldin' like envelopes 
 Under pressure like Lou Farigno on coke 
 Yo, Africans denyin niggaz up in yellow cabs 
 Musty like funk, wavin they arms, the Arabs 
 Sit back, coolin like Kahlua's on rocks 
 On the crack spots, rubberband wrapped on my knots 
 You bitches who fuck dreds on Sudafeds 
 Pussy's hurtin', they did it for a yard for the Feds 
 Word up cousin, nigga, I seen it 
 Like a 27-inch Zenith - believe it 
 Now yo yo, whattup yo, time is runnin' out 
 It's for real though, let's connect politic - ditto 
 We could trade places, get lifted in the staircases 
 Word up, peace incarcerated scarfaces 
 Now yo yo, whattup yo, time is runnin' out 
 It's for real though, let's connect politic - ditto 
 ... Get lifted in the staircases 
 ... Peace incarcerated scarfaces 
 ... Time is runnin' out 
 ... Politic - ditto 
 ... Incarcerated scarfaces
