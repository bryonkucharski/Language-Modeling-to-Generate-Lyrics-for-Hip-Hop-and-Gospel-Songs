Did he have hands? 
 Did he have a face? 
 Yes 
 Then it wasn't us 
 (Raekwon) 
 Bernard Goetz Gazelle's on 
 .45 in the bag, mask a Bourdon 
 Sacks Willy jury is all really 
 Rich nigga's paying for the team 
 Sniff the eighth and feed Lily 
 Lily is a cocaine Willy 
 Who got mad connects in a small town in Philly 
 Octopus soul sister rock a puss 
 Ghost outside parked vertical 
 Yeah, the Jakes'll murder you 
 Four to five hundred bricks 
 Dicks come in with no tie on 
 That symbolizes the wire on 
 All Krylon heat my rings bling 500 feet away 
 Hit the church steeples in the D 
 Brand new shells on, a python, a Fisker 
 Twist from the Astons made for the listener 
 Or rather yeah, the driver, suicide rider 
 B bums and Wally's, me and Shallah's colleagues 
 4 in the morning [8x] 
 (Raekwon) 
 Blow hands, the stove is a roaster where bottles whip in motion 
 May cause 'drop him in the ocean' 
 Irish blood gangsters, the roulettes 
 Cooler moving through Texas, grandmother she Mex-ish, yup 
 Tablets, krills, bath salts, last call, get it 
 Drugs flying minutes like a fastball 
 Smash all, I will remain clean, the status calm 
 I do it for niggas who last long 
 Last Don's chill, Kings in the chair, cigars in the air 
 This the last part with snakes that'll break any man's arm 
 Which way the grass growin' 
 We've sown enough and now we're farmers 
 Who come through with lawn mowers and armor 
 4 in the morning [8x] 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Yeah, I used to move cracks, sort diesel and gats 
 Runnin' trains on them hood rat bitches up in the trap 
 We used to blow 'em out 
 Fiends comin' in hike with they seized bite 
 With residue stuck all on they pipe 
 4 in the mornin' when the gates start jumpin' 
 Dustheads lurkin' and the fiends start thumpin' 
 And it seems like the fiends, he own CREAM, so they jumpin' 
 Bean told Cream he stole green so he cut 'em 
 Ditch him Star, souflee'd one half of his cheekbone 
 Now he talkin' out the side of his mouth 
 But yo, peep homes, stuck 
 Fly dust, that's four finger nuggets 
 With plastic stuffed in the Kangol buckets 
 Dirty burners on, gloves and scanners 
 Smart mouth, Teymor bitches in the back gettin' sandwiched 
 After a dick suck accountant 
 In the wee hours, backing up mountains 
 4 in the morning 
 4 in the morning [8x]
