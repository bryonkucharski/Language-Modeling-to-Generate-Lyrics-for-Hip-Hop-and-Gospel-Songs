Murder you (Check your 30) 
 Murder you (Check your 30) 
 Murder you (Check your 30) 
 Bring the head, leave the body 
 So much bread in a nigga's shoebox 
 I might dead you and sleep in new lots 
 I drop a bag on one of you crab-ass nigga's so fast 
 I send two boxes out 
 Yeah, bring the head, leave the body 
 Leave his trainers in a nigga lobby 
 Take the fake chains off, send it to his colleagues 
 Laugh in his shit, pissin up crystal molly's 
 I rep drug dealers, hug killers 
 I ran with most of them 
 Half is in the ocean, nigga 
 So much gear, go get Oprah, nigga 
 So what my bitch a Oprah nigga, yo 
 Yeah, what color ice is all green, karma 
 Magazines stacked, black bomber 
 Been all through the world gettin' homage 
 Diss mines'? We gon' have a big problem 
 Murder you (Check your 30) 
 Murder you (Check your 30) 
 Murder you (Check your 30) 
 Bring the head, leave the body 
 If you wanna hit me, you couldn't 
 Bullet range, door wooden 
 Hop out, y'all nigga's is pudding 
 Why try to leave, the federation 
 This is all legislation 
 Will kill you right in front of your seed 
 Catch me in the trips 
 Over the stove, giving you tips 
 I'm fresh outta court, nigga, you hit 
 Four's on my wrist, it's business 
 Keeping 'em close 
 Like folding ya arms 
 Don't go against this 
 The worldwide brawlers, the legends of sevens 
 Yo, them the real shot callers 
 Who stay in the home always 
 Ballin' at 4 in the mornin' 
 Yo we all in, teach you how to score kin 
 My killers, all of us we all winning 
 Fresh designer shit, snatchin' papes 
 We on different scales, different weights 
 You just monkey nigga's, meet the apes 
 Strictly business, gorillas in 50 states 
 Murder you (Check your 30) 
 Murder you (Check your 30) 
 Murder you (Check your 30) 
 Bring the head, leave the body
