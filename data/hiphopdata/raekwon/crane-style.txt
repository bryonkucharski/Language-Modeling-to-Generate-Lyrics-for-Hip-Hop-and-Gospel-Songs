(Intro: Raekwon) 
 Come on, man, you a wild dude, Chef 
 Talk to them niggas, man, stop playing, man 
 For real, man 
 Raekwon: 
 Redskin leather, Indian sex 
 Pair of fresh Mocs on, lighting Lear on my flesh 
 Let my arm roll, fresh off the honor roll, platinum bottles of Cru' 
 All my niggas do what I got 'em for 
 Extra flashy grind, hit 'em with a crisp rhyme 
 Lines is nothing, blunt out, fuck him 
 All we know is jewelry and I mashed that, everybody excited 
 To see whatever bling on, smash that 
 Clever, more like a fox and ox together 
 Two stainless glocks, rocks and a feather 
 Yeah, I'm from the lead era, shoot at 
 Anything that move, and move out America 
 And all we ever want is needed, seen it 
 Like a young Filipino in Kuwait getting treated 
 Heavy horror armor, spike a bitch like her 
 Half a pound of good weed, then float through Gowanus 
 Brilliant master, sixteenth chapel in the Apple 
 Flooded up, Warridge wackos 
 Park Hillians getting hillions, that means millions 
 All on feet like Nigerian 
 Busta Rhymes: 
 Shallah, I got 'em 
 Heat-seeking missile spit, don't even try to hide, nigga 
 Sizzle through your skin bars, call me cyanide, bitch 
 Try me if you want, homey, violation's a no-no 
 I am the health hazard, skull and bone, poisonous logo 
 Unleash the dragon, massacre the scene 
 I'm spitting, burn a hole through the speaker, 
 And start melting the street up 
 Somebody please call the fire department 
 And I'm a strong believer, 
 Y'all know that I ain't the one to start with 
 Cause once the fuse is lit and we strike a match and the spark smell 
 My fangs bleed and we nam them up like ox tail 
 Y'all see what's happening, y'all know what the truth is 
 Somebody please ask Shallah Rae why he making me do this 
 Cause once I finish dudes, it's unfortunate for them yappers 
 Throw them in the trash, they ain't no recycling bin for rappers 
 I microphone control, it's the current dominant factor 
 The records been bodied, I personally request the pastor, gone
