(Raekwon) 
 Bubble Goose, smokin' bubble kush 
 The Uzis is navy blue, a couple coupes 
 Satan around, stackin' suckers, save the truce 
 Mansions before these niggas, we done, we deucin' 
 Crackin' fish in the Ritz Carlton, take a piss 
 69 floors up, sparklin' Cris' 
 Moneybags stacked in duvet sheets 
 Few strange freaks follow the Wraiths 
 Walk through the gates, nigga 
 Pyrex Cubano connection 
 New York Mexicans, they call us the team for smugglin' wet shit 
 The Al Pacinos of rap, yep, they planned it with me 
 Pass the baguette, gold Louis phone, hand it to me 
 Raised a million champs, this is our civilian's lamp 
 Furless sweats, stay in jets, kill a billion camps 
 Pussy niggas get strangled fast 
 Still I'm cool on the fast, rockin' the grill of glass 
 Desert boot on, countin' a million cash 
 This is all I ask for, love is fair war, let's build the masses 
 Sittin', boat sailin', scenic routes, catch the quotes 
 Young, armed and dangerous [?] couple posters 
 I'm like known in a couple coasts 
 Rae and Ghost, familiar with us? Wraiths and Ghosts 
 (Rick Ross) 
 I'm hearin' how these niggas plottin' 
 Madame sleepin' on Egyptian cotton 
 Miles Davis vinyl still spinnin' 
 I've been to Freaknik, I've been livin' 
 You see the Bentley and we smokin' in the parking lot 
 Contract killers so we rarely talk a lot 
 Guiseppes and my weapon when you see me steppin' 
 10th grade education with a MAC-11 
 The definition of a renaissance 
 Twice a day I change watches, chains and the charms 
 Tatted on my back, chest and my palms 
 Then it's me and Diddy, dice games at the Palms 
 Blew a mil' in cash just to let the bitches watch 
 Take her down to the lobby, get the bitch a watch 
 Tinted windows, smokin' with a screw face 
 Black hoodies on, bullies think it's Wu-Tang 
 Barry White blarin' in the white Benz 
 Runnin' like I had a curly perm back then 
 It's Rozay and I'm 40 up 
 Pink Belaire in a nigga's cup 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Ayo jumpin' out the shower, jewels on, heated up 
 Fluffy Polo towels in Melbourne, gettin' it 
 Hands is ashy, cash keep comin', dice hand like Lil Poo 
 Young god bowlin' with thunder 
 Bettin' bricks out at the Knicks came with Cubans from Biscayne 
 Burnin' the Castro cigars with a big flame 
 Godfather coats and hard bottoms 
 Everything down to cribs, hoes and gear, we got 'em 
 It's the lean team, Medellín chains 
 Shop niggas like fresh fruit, like old grand earth, can of green beans 
 We'll cut you and you and you, nigga 
 This is me, Rae and Rick; box-cutters on crews, nigga
