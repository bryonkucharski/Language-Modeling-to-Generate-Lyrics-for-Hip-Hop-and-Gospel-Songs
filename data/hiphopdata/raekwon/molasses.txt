(Intro: Raekwon) 
 Yo, legend, what's good, legend, what's going on? 
 (Yo, we gotta do the intro over and all that, right?) Ice H2O 
 (Ight, keep all that, keep all that) Keep our palace, nigga 
 Yeah, word up, yeah, yeah, yeah, turn me up, son 
 Yo, Ross, what up, my nigga? (Murderous shit) Aiyo, aiyo 
 (Verse 1: Raekwon) 
 Word to the gold panamaras, and to the wood grain in my labo 
 I go the extra mile, my flow scaffolds 
 Crew cuts, the older niggas, the same rumors, just the same goons 
 When niggas catch visions of killing capos 
 Palestinian armor, golden rocket launcher, my aunt 
 She copped it from me, bought it in Rwanda 
 See demons scheming, niggas get live in the Beacon 
 I'm 'shaw' to 'shank' shit up like Morgan Freeman 
 Pussy getting rapper, rich nigga, one-on-one rents niggas 
 And incidents, my fingerprints been tore up 
 We sell love slinging like Siemens, the snortable Beemers 
 They love calling niggas names out, you screaming 
 Feds try to tap us and plus clap us, niggas'll grab Bust' 
 Throw you in the rassle, yo, clap ups 
 Catch me at the Stephen King mansion, with four of my Branson niggas 
 With me, me and Britney, a dancer 
 Know your shit authentic by the way your hat fit on you, with it 
 I'm like the Blair Witch nigga in the rented 
 Curtains in the five-seven, chunky and short 
 Bagging dope up in the backseat, your packages walk 
 Holding my girl wedding ring, she Medellin 
 Name is Coretta King, live in Alpharetta and she never leave me 
 Flow freely this is all graffiti, the cloth I'm cut from 
 Is straight from a rich nigga genie 
 (Chorus x2: Raekwon) 
 Yo, Scarface gangstas, criminal niggas up in the trenches 
 Army coats on, playing the benches 
 Getting paper, sly, that's the motto, intelligent goons 
 Inside a hundred thousand dollar whip, follow 
 (Verse 2: Rick Ross) 
 The fucking Juan Don, yeah, Su Wu-Tang 
 Still gritty, leave the pretty to the females 
 The watch mother pearl weather seashells 
 Pick of the litter, have this nigga picking paper up 
 Twitter thug, I'm the townline strangler 
 Get 'em up, banging dangerous as angel dust 
 Cuban Linx smoking stink in the Brink's trunk 
 I run with killas who snort powder, extort cowards 
 Ankle monitors under garments, so fuck showers 
 I give a fuck what you talking 'bout 
 Mob meetings, we them only niggas walking out 
 Sparking purple once a nigga done spaghetti slurping 
 Fly away in my new, Scabetti, surfing 
 (Chorus x2: Raekwon) 
 Yo, Scarface gangstas, criminal niggas up in the trenches 
 Army coats on, playing the benches 
 Getting paper, sly, that's the motto, intelligent goons 
 Inside a hundred thousand dollar whip, follow 
 (Verse 3: Ghostface Killah) 
 Yo, we in the back roasting marshmallows, bottles of Cru' 
 The dialogue is the big chain niggas is rude 
 Law library scholars, potatoes over the thirty eights 
 With bald-heads, all live wires 
 Eleven homes, six trust funds, came home from doing a dime 
 We just left Un's, straight up 
 And we standing over the stoves, in denim Gibaud's 
 Bought a Dairy Queen in Queens right next to Lowe's 
 IMAX Theaters, Astoria Waldorf 
 Philip Drummer suite, pretty young thing sucking my balls off 
 Bubble baths, hash, zooted up, eyes closed 
 Silk drawers, fronting in my key lime pie Wall-o's 
 And I still got a half a key indeed, Frank Lucas shit 
 Hidden in coffins, flying over seas 
 And if you ever try to ruin my night 
 I'm a make sure my best pawn put like three in your kite 
 Shot caller, laying in big laws 
 Rock of Gibraltar, my pinky joint, killer like Orca 
 Daytime hawk, a nasty street author 
 Me, Rae and Rick, Uzi'd out in the Porsche's 
 Case we gotta Warner bro, like Malcolm-Jamal 
 I'm a Falcon, Seven Mike Vick with the ball 
 'Cause I can hut-one, hut-two, disrespect, I hunt you down 
 Ain't a muthafuckin' crew we can't run through 
 (Chorus x2: Raekwon) 
 Yo, Scarface gangstas, criminal niggas up in the trenches 
 Army coats on, playing the benches 
 Getting paper, sly, that's the motto, intelligent goons 
 Inside a hundred thousand dollar whip, follow 
 Army shit, nigga 
 Camouflage, guerrilla shit, nigga 
 You know what it is, man 
 Yo, Lex, talk, yeah 
 Where ya man at? Let's go 
 Stay together, my nigga
