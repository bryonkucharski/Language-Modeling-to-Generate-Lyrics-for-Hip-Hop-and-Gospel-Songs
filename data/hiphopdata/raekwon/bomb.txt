Slammin' 
 Drugs got me wakin' up in cold sweats 
 Sometimes I'm slightly off my rocker, but I'm on deck 
 Got 2 and a baby off my bitches student loan check 
 She hit my line to get that girl, I call it phone sex 
 Robbing like my problems ain't gon catch up to me later 
 Bitch I'm mobbing like OG Bobby Johnson, split your potato 
 At the table, cooking, shaving and touching base with them basers 
 Bet they try to make a play for the yay' as soon as they taste it 
 The amazin' black American Gangster, sinister, corner her 
 'Cause seeing this nigga shine been annoying me like a muthafucka 
 This busta owe me, now he act like he don't know me 
 Forty fo' my closest homie, kill cockaroaches like Tony 
 Got Montana money 
 You bought 100, dipped in fluid, yo, I had to smoke it 
 Pupils dilated like silver dollars, now we know-cking 
 Call it devilish how I do bitch 
 Fuck these niggas talking, I leave they thoughts on my shoestrings 
 What? 
 Rolling 
 Pockets all swollen 
 Set the record straight, that FNH is what I'm holding 
 A busta that we know got 15 'bows, bust it open 
 We came bandana'd up, divide it up, now what's the quotient? 
 A split with 4 niggas, since I'm a go getter 
 I think these suckers pussy, I'ma merk the whole litter 
 Told my girl to leave as soon as I hung up the phone with her 
 Man, I heard you rob the robbers, look Freddie a cold nigga 
 Got an ice maker for a heart, made nigga from the start 
 Life is like a movie, all I did was play my fuckin' part 
 Cheffing up the crack, the heroin, and the weed a la carte 
 I call it Fast Freddie's, I should own a fuckin' restaurant 
 'Cause back when I was 12 threw some bells on a scale and I got a pager 
 We broke them down and started selling nickels to the neighbors 
 Eventually the penitentiary gon' see me later 
 Kiss my momma, told her if I die, then it was part of nature 
 What? 
 28 days later we all getting fresh 
 Got the heart to die for something, flesh to flesh 
 The Lambo, got her outside, it's a stretch 
 My bitch half Mexican/Afghan, I'm blessed 
 From living tough times with rough lemons, a gorgeous watch 
 My team on a dreadful level, yo 
 Yeah, we still getting money right 
 Long as the sun come out, I'll hold these twenties tight 
 Getting fresh, just cooling, my bitch on my dick 
 Ba boom yo, you live with your moms, just get a grip 
 Clip in my pocket, a rocket 
 I think of the Dips, I need Juelz and Jims, with rough licks 
 Trips to Africa, shorty tear Saks up 
 I'm out in Bombay, rebels here actin' up 
 We real, all G, 7500 of us 
 Up in the Sprinter bus, fussin' "we need more heat"
