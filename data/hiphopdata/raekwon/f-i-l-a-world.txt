 Dressed in FILA, change in the beehive 
 7:30 nigga slick coupe with him, see ma? 
 I'm rich, my bitch, before and after, kept her well 
 Sit right there, enjoy the chapter 
 Bounce, 2 ounces get burnt 
 Thinkin' bread now, buy more lead, get the dread town 
 Let's smoke on the furlough king 
 Switch to Merlot, I know them niggas is bird, they swerve dope 
 Nobody gettin' it, whores is wicked with it 
 Little kids growin' up fast, teens is wickeded 
 No jobs, no checks, it's like rockin' an Olex 
 Rolex, her father is Cotex 
 Mother is so vexed, brothers is on X 
 Niggas is slummin' it, I'd rather see no necks 
 Dumb niggas, this the decade of bum niggas 
 It won't work, no matter how much bread you jerk 
 (2 Chainz) 
 Inhale it (x3) 
 Weed so loud, all my neighbors say they hear it 
 Roll up the strong, inhale it (x3) 
 Weed so loud, all my neighbors say they hear it

 I'm usually in the lawsuits frontin' 
 Comin' out Bank of America, big knot on me, I'm comfy 
 Roll the joints, jumpin' in joints, niggas with coins beat the point 
 And we want appointments, yo nigga, get some ointment 
 Stop playin', start prayin', I just might start sprayin' 
 Niggas is ass and all day with it 
 No style with no pals, niggas is so foul 
 It shows how I only fuck with real, them niggas know now 
 I slow down, don't wanna catch a charge and go down 
 I'm too large, drop a bag, use a marksman 
 Pause, said, "You don't want no parts of me, kid" 
 I'm just shootin' you real rap, so go wash with it 
 A legend with his hands up, suits is glammed up 
 I'm just bowlin' for millions out in Japan, what 
 Plannin' somethin', niggas ride around wearin' somethin' 
 Other than that or rap, I'd rather fade black

 Inhale it (x3) 
 Weed so loud, all my neighbors say they hear it 
 Roll up the strong, inhale it (x3) 
 Weed so loud, all my neighbors say they hear it

 These niggas is dead already, I use machetes to eat spaghetti 
 They really couldn't ride a mile on my Pirellis 
 Bags so heavy the damns collapsed 
 Conversate about me, that's a chain reaction 
 Pressure to press in past aggression 
 Hope your body guard got pain protection 
 One in the chamber, middle finger, no fornicate 
 So many bullets in the clip, it's 'bout to sufficate 
 My uncle was late, my aunt ain't show up 
 How you gon' tell an old man to grow up 
 It's like comparin' Earl to throw up 
 Same frame of mind but a different poster 
 I'm 'posed to be what I wanna be 
 Dream so big for the world to see 
 First class, fruits and tea 
 And usually the only black man is me 
 (2 Chainz) 
 Inhale it (x3) 
 Weed so loud, all my neighbors say they hear it 
 Roll up the strong, inhale it (x3) 
 Weed so loud, all my neighbors say they hear it
