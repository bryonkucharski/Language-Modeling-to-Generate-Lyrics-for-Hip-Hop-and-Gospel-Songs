Ricky Ross, Raekwon the chef 
 Thrill 5 M I A, yo 
 Y'all know what time it is, trilla, boss 
 When I'm in the crib, know what time it is 
 I'm trying to get a mill, so money I can feel 
 Fuck a bank account, boss, keep my money in bags 
 If you coming here funny, I'm gunning your ass 
 Nigga, take a look at me, Ross, tell me what's fucking funny 
 Bitch, I'm a top shotter, see all the macks, gunny 
 Now I'm the pacman, I keep the packs coming 
 And I got a whole lot, so when that shack coming, baby 
 I can hold mine or I can pitch back 
 Or I can run an option, get it popping, whip that 
 All my Cuban links, still rocking they Cuban Linx 
 And they ready to swim, give me the Cuban six 
 I got it orchestrated 'cause I'm a communist 
 Running for the charms, some left on the wrist 
 My nigga Raekwon, yeah, he the fucking chef 
 So what we cook in the kitchen, he taste the fucking best 
 Nigga, I'm a boss, you can catch me with the top knocked off 
 In the trap, getting blocks knocked off 
 'Cause nigga, I'm a boss and I'ma show these niggas I ain't gotta talk 
 I got a chauffeur, nigga, I ain't got to walk 
 'Cause nigga, I'm a boss, cross the line, pay the fine top cost 
 Lose your mind when the nine pop off 
 'Cause nigga, I'm a boss, I'm a boss, I'm a boss 
 'Cause nigga, I'm a boss, I'm a boss, I'm a boss 
 You know we rich, Rick, my vultures, they get dip, we posting 
 It's in motion when that blow come, we flip-flip 
 Can't take us nowhere, pa, too many spaceships 
 Lay in the open, new Nike's with glaciers 
 Love robbing niggas, cracking heads open 
 It's like tennis, pa, I'm like Venus with the legs smoking 
 Piping hot heroes, gun deleros, new Aston 
 Sky blue jammy, skating on zeros 
 Shorts on, tree lance, cable on, hang to my navel 
 Diamond down, smoking cheeba, Grey Goose 
 Dreaming bout lasagna, the beat watery 
 Half glass of Whiskey, fly light skin little shorty 
 All my bitches they bang, it's obvious, we be the gods 
 Rep me and my mobster sang 
 We monsters, rocket launchers, razor blades 
 With wands on, shoot up the telly, go bonkers 
 Nigga, I'm a boss, you can catch me with the top knocked off 
 In the trap, getting blocks knocked off 
 'Cause nigga, I'm a boss and I'ma show these niggas I ain't gotta talk 
 I got a chauffeur, nigga, I ain't got to walk 
 'Cause nigga, I'm a boss, cross the line, pay the fine top cost 
 Lose your mind when the nine pop off 
 'Cause nigga, I'm a boss, I'm a boss, I'm a boss 
 'Cause nigga, I'm a boss, I'm a boss, I'm a boss 
 Yo, I'm the money collector for that money I'll stretch ya 
 I flat line you with that gun that's up under my dresser 
 I be handling pies, goddamn it I'm fly 
 It's so high, that if I jump I'll land in the sky 
 You ain't pushing no weight, you a pussy, you fake 
 I be cooking that base, butter just look at they face 
 Light keep 'em coming back, the Don, keep 'em coming back 
 It's the boss and Rick Ross on the fucking track 
 Nigga, I'm a boss, you can catch me with the top knocked off 
 In the trap, getting blocks knocked off 
 'Cause nigga, I'm a boss and I'ma show these niggas I ain't gotta talk 
 I got a chauffeur, nigga, I ain't got to walk 
 'Cause nigga, I'm a boss, cross the line, pay the fine top cost 
 Lose your mind when the nine pop off 
 'Cause nigga, I'm a boss, I'm a boss, I'm a boss 
 'Cause nigga, I'm a boss, I'm a boss, I'm a boss
