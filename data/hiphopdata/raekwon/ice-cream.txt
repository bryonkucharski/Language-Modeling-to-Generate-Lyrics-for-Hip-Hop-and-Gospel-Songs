Hey mom, can I have some money? 
 The ice cream man is coming! 
 Watch these rap niggas get all up in your guts 
 French-vanilla, butter-pecan, chocolate-deluxe 
 Even caramel sundaes is gettin' touched 
 And scooped in my ice cream truck, Wu tears it up 
 (The ice cream man is coming!) 
 Yo honey-dips, summertime, fine Jheri drippin 
 See you on Pickens with a bunch of chickens how you're clickin' 
 I catch shootin' strong notes as we got close 
 She rocked rope, honey throat smellin' like Impulse 
 Your whole shell baby's wicked like Nimrod 
 Caught me like a fresh-water scrod, or may I not be God 
 Attitude is very rude Boo, crabby like seafood 
 It turns me on like Vassey and Lahrule 
 They call me Starky Love-hun, check the strategy 
 By any means, Shirley Temple cross was done by Billie Jean's 
 Black Misses America, your name is Erica, right true 
 Lazy eyeball, small piece, six shoe 
 Caramel complexion, breath smellin' like cinnamon 
 Excuse me hon, the Don mean no harm, turn around again 
 God damn, backyard's bangin' like a Benz-y 
 If I was jiggy, you'd be spotted like Spuds McKenzie 
 I'm high powered put Adina Howard to sleep 
 Yo pardon, that bitch been on my mind all week, but uh 
 Back to you Maybelline Queen let's make a team 
 You can have anything in this world except cream 
 So whatchu wanna do? Whatchu wanna do? 
 Let's go ahead and walk these dogs and represent Wu 
 Watch these rap niggas get all up in your guts 
 French-vanilla, butter-pecan, chocolate-deluxe 
 Even caramel sundaes is gettin' touched 
 And scooped in my ice cream truck, Wu tears it up 
 (The ice cream man is coming!) 
 Shaolin's finest, what up Boo, peace your highness 
 Yo I'm loungin', big dick style, y'all niggas is the flyest 
 Moves you're making too fly jewels are shaking 
 Not a rape patient, you're looking good fly colored Asian 
 Ghettoes, them is your hometown, we can go the whole round 
 After that, I'm shootin' downtown 
 I'm rockin' hats and you wig is all intact 
 Who's that queen bee chick, eyes curly black 
 Freaks be movin' in fly sneaks 
 Two finger rings and gold teeth, and ain't afraid to hold heat 
 So when I step in the square dear 
 You better have cream to share, Ricans, ven aqui yeah 
 Watch these rap niggas get all up in your guts 
 French-vanilla, butter-pecan, chocolate-deluxe 
 Even caramel sundaes is gettin' touched 
 And scooped in my ice cream truck, Wu tears it up 
 (The ice cream man is coming!) 
 Black chocolate girl wonder, shade brown like Thunder 
 Politic till your deficit step, gimme your number 
 Your sexy persuasive ta-ta's and thighs 
 Catch my eyes like highs I want your bodily surprise 
 Double dime some time, Ice Cream you got me fallin' out 
 Like a cripple, I love you like I love my dick size 
 Ooh baby I miss you, your sweet tender touches 
 Take pulls off the dutches, orgasm in my mindstate 
 Masturbate in your clutches, I want you for self 
 Like wealth, so play me closely 
 Bitches paranoia for the sting, who want the most of me 
 Only a hard dozen want to be callin' me cousin 
 Thirsty for my catalog, baby shoppin' spree you're lovin' 
 Call me if you want to get dug like the pockets 
 I jizm like a giant break brooms out of their sockets 
 Wu-Tang in the cut, for real niggas what? 
 It's the after party and bitches want to fuck 
 Watch these rap niggas get all up in your guts 
 French-vanilla, butter-pecan, chocolate-deluxe 
 Even caramel sundaes is gettin' touched 
 Scooped in the ice cream truck, Wu tears it up 
 Ice cold bitches melt down when my clutch 
 And what they titties sucked, ice cream 
 Yeah, your guts 
 French-vanilla, butter-pecan, chocolate-deluxe 
 Even caramel sundaes is gettin' touched 
 Scooped in the ice cream truck, Wu tears it up 
 Ice cold bitches melt down when my clutch 
 And what they titties sucked, ice cream 
 One love to my chocolate deluxes, keep your nails done 
 And your wigs tight, word up 
 One love to my butter-pecan Ricans for calling me papi 
 That's for real 
 One love to caramel sundaes, with the cherries on top 
 Yeah 
 And big up to my French vanillas 
 Parlez vous francais, mi amor, merci, oui oui, bon bons 
 And all that good stuff
