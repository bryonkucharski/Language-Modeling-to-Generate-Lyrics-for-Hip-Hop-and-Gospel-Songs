And in our line of work, we need all the help we can get 
 Tony Wind is the name, he works for a drug ring in Central America 
 Who wants to kill him? 
 No information, say yes or no 
 One point five million 
 All right, you get what you want -- money's no object 
 They're all clean, no serial numbers, untraceable 
 And there are explosive head bullets, in the clip 
 (Raekwon, Ghostface, (Method)) 
 Yo yo yo yo yo yo yo-yo, here come the cop man 
 Yo Starks come here, come here Sun 
 Come here for a minute! 
 Aiyyo aiyyo hold up hold up 
 Shit we gotta go to the store for more baking soda 
 Yo yo yo get your fuckin', yo this made of glass nig! 
 Get your big Adidas off my moms table man!

 (Tony Starks) 
 Universal frontier 
 (Original blood claat bad bwoys) 
 Chorus: Method Man 
 Who come to get you? None. They want guns! 
 I be the first to set off shit, last to run 
 Wu roll together as one 
 I call my brother Sun 'cause he shine like one 
 Verse One: Method Man, a.k.a. Johnny Blaze 
 Check it 
 Scriptures hit the body like sawed off shotties 
 Like my hair notty and my nosepiece snotty 
 Fuck a nigga hottie, that whole pussy probably 
 Burn like the deserts of Mogabi, for real 
 Ain't nothing fraudulent here, we pioneer 
 Commandeer a new frontier, this be the Wu yeah 
 36 Chambers of fear, huh, you lost it 
 Information leaking out your faucets, hmmmmm 
 Time to forfeit your crown and leave the ground 
 There's a new sheriff in town holdin' it down 
 It's the two holster, shit shot smoker 
 Wanted dead or alive, bounty on the poster 
 Wild in the West, a student of my culture 
 And life is the test, hold up 
 Let a nigga catch his breath, we still paying dues 
 And the last one is death, back to the essence 
 With that shit you stressing, this rap profession 
 Now peep Tical, the son of the Shaolin 
 Isle plus my style, Criminology pays 
 The last times and days, Johnny fuckin' Blaze 
 Verse Two: Raekwon the Chef, a.k.a. Lou Diamonds 
 This goes for niggaz who know 
 Wu will grow like llello, ley no, plus coolin in Barbados 
 Ricaans be givin' me much shit, the dutch shit 
 Stay cool papi, seize it with enough shit 
 Back at the lab a, crack's bagged up 
 Yo niggaz act up, what blow up the workers if they hafta 
 Senoritas, fuckin' up a storm buyin guards margaritas 
 Suckin his dick, up in the whip long 
 Designed for rhyme prime nigga jail time jiggas 
 Them niggaz up in Height figures bitin niggaz 
 Silks Wally-Wear finger rolled chain yeah 
 Jakes beware black rap millionaires 
 Rock hairs leather goose bears blowin' this year 
 One eight hundred gambino niggaz yeah 
 Meth: 
 Wu roll together as one 
 I call my brother Sun 'cause he shine like one 
 Verse Three: RZA, a.k.a. Bobby Steels 
 Solid gold crown is shinin 
 Solid gold, check it Sun yo 
 Solid gold crown be shinin and blindin like some diamonds 
 I be pioneering the style in the cloud with silver linings 
 Double breasted, bullet proof vested, well protected 
 The heart the rib cage the chest and solar plexus 
 Casting stones, cracking two-hundred and six bones 
 And watch yo' ass get blown to a sea of fire and brimstone 
 How dare you approach it with dim pones 
 The overfiend like noah bean green souls with a soldier mean 
 The grand exquisite imperial wizard oh is it 
 The Ryzarector come to pay your ass a visit 
 Local bio-chemical, universal giant, the black general 
 Lickin' shots to Davy Crockett on the bicentennial 
 Happen millennium two thousand microchips two shots of penicillin 
 Goes up your adrenalin son it's time for boutin 
 It's a mileage resemblin niggaz who like followin 
 Trapped inside your projects like a genie inside the bottle 
 Verse Four: Master Killer 
 God steppin forth upon holy down of the track 
 It's the sound that surrounds and hurts me like I'm under attack 
 So I decided to bite down on the mic 
 So the pain of the track won't deny the fact 
 That I'm the Master, for what lurks, is an expert 
 That hurts the individual who tries to visualize under 
 'Cause I strike, like thunder 
 Niggaz couldn't stand my heat, it's unbearable 
 My wisdom fucks up your respiratorial 
 Systems are fractured by the killa tactics 
 Style is ragged and thoughts are mad jagged 
 Enter the entity, my vicinity 
 Is three hundred and sixty degrees of humidity 
 Represent the school of hard knocks and glocks my 
 Clan is hoss and got mad moss for blocks so 
 Feel the force of impact from the iron side of 
 The gat as I attack the track 
 From the blind side of the pack, Starks pass the chrome 
 Watch a nigga get blown out his muthafuckin dome 
 Piece, deceased, laid to rest 
 Verse Five: Ghostface Killer, a.k.a. Tony Starks 
 Yo, aiyyo I got to serve them my way, move give me room 
 Holdin' up your saloon, clean sweep, like a broom 
 Full moons make me howl like a wolf outta breath 
 Sold only new vocal cords I heard Genius on Gef 
 So step back, to the lab at, high velocity 
 My teammate, enhance cells well like a pharmacy 
 Fuck horado pablos plan growas bravo 
 Goodfellas we know, best sellas become novels 
 The man rockin' head bands, silk scarves and jams 
 Early 80's british rock, playboys, mocks, and shams 
 The laser beam vocalist does well at symphonies 
 Bad days, watch me snatch ice right outta Tiffany's 
 Remember them kids that came off with 8 million 
 Robbed the Brinks and I labelled in royal pavillions 
 Them flower heads must have been stupid 
 Tell me how the fuck black niggaz get caught wit all that loot kid 
 That's jet money, undaground money 
 Submarines and rings too bad you fucked up dummies 
 Cosa cosa, come on...
