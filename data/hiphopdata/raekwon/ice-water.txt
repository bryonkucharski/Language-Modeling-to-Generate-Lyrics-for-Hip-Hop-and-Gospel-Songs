Intro: Ghostface Killer 
 Tommy Hil' rockin' ice niggaz 
 Tommy Hil' ice rockin' niggaz who fuck... 
 Mira, afrente 
 Take a one on one to this shit y'all (yeah) 
 Get your nostrils clear (yeah) 
 Come on, sniff your brains out 
 All my Al Capone, Al Pacino niggaz (yeah) 
 Who's down with drug smuggling 
 Cappadonna, Golden Arms 
 Verse One: Ghostface Killer 
 Yo, yo 
 Take out the rap kingpin, the black Jesus 
 I know a few niggaz sniff coke, it cause seizures 
 Peace to half-moon Caesars and all the bitches in the bleachers 
 Hot weather, sex on the beaches 
 Jury shopping out of the country, deluxe luxury, 
 People saying dem not change, look, truckle me 
 But what about the Wonder Woman bracelet 
 Two-oh point three diamond cut engraved rubies, kid I laced it 
 My sweet tooth gotta nigga throbbin, ready for robbin 
 But first hit Maria's, for a butter almond 
 The bionic microphone is stacked mechanic 
 Move like a bunch of Mexicans with bandanas 
 Son, it's on so we can just Maximillion 
 I got the spot sewn, so we can make a billion 
 The God's tropical, ladies call me black fruit punch 
 Rainbow, flavored niggas murder niggas for lunch 
 Peace to the Paris crew in the avenue and my nigga Jay Love 
 Who carries switch blades on the red roof 
 Verse Two: Cappadonna 
 Yo, the first branch, the third leaf, whoever want it got beef 
 I politic, show love, crush those who dare creep 
 Into my realm of sunshine I praise divine 
 Fine line between dawn of dumb, deaf and blind 
 He ain't mine, he shook like the faggots on daytime 
 Crossed over grain while we was bubblin moonshine 
 Sippin on the Moet, laid up, Rae-Gambino 
 Mastermind the plan, Tony Starks, Cappachino 
 Develop while your head be swellin up all for the nation 
 Blinded by the ice while I release the confrontation 
 Donna holy fat bads of weed, ravioli 
 Pasta, Bodyguard the Killa Bee songs like Kevin Costner 
 Infrared all inside your bumba rasta 
 Cappadonna pimped the derby like the mobster 
 Interlude: Ghostface 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Eight spaghetti lame brain ass niggaz 
 Quarters, nickels, and dimes bitch 
 Except for overtime nigga 
 Any ass money should be fine 
 'Cause I'm coming strong, reaking niggas backs 
 Keepin' shit real 
 If you haven't noticed this crazy ass rusty, ass nigga 
 Let me tell you this four times 
 Tony Starks, Raekwon the chef 
 Cappachino and Golden Arms 
 Is comin' through mad strong 
 From the isles of Shaolin 
 For all them faggot ass 
 Rusty ticket-head bitches too 
 Shump shump baby 
 Verse Three: Raekwon the Chef 
 Yo back in the days, bagging crack, scrapin plates 
 Flippin cakes to them heavy head niggaz hating Jakes 
 It be us, all the war's soldiers, hanging in halls getting over 
 City niggaz who for blood money rocking Rovers 
 Stay dipped, don't have no money in your pocket 
 In the streets while these people mark money in their Jeep 
 Crack bums watch your back for jumps 
 Caught before a fake twenty dollar bill, get 'em son, we ain't the one 
 Politickin, purse vickin, sick of these Dominicans 
 Eating good, had to shoot my way up out of Bennigans 
 That's life, to top it all off, beef for White 
 Pulling bleach out trying to throw it in my eyesight 
 Yo what the fuck was on yo mind?
