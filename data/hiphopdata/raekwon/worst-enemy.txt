(Liz Rodrigues) 
 I'm wrapped up [?] trying to break free 
 I'm my own worst enemy, me 
 They'll never let me by though, 'cause I'm always tryna beat 
 Beat my worst enemy, me 
 (Raekwon) 
 Ayo, a better platform for all to listen to me 
 We out in DC deep, ain't got no sleep 
 The ride bumpy, who jetted out the country to buy D 
 Came back, [?] ain't nothin' sweet 
 My dome is yellin', "Go home!" but I ain't through 
 So many years in my career, it's a long route 
 Thinkin' when [?] skinned his face on the plaster 
 We was dusted back then, I smoked the last of it 
 And jumped into the Acura, sleepin' at [?], what it do? 
 Stew, beef, chicken, where my boo? 
 Had a quarrel with a hood rockstar, I broke his arm off 
 'Cause he was pointin' his fingers at Ivanne's daughter 
 What's next? Dreads want a piece of my spot 
 This my crib, I pay here to live, fuck the pap

 Ridin' with the gun cocked, sweatin', musty tee on 
 Black Timb Bs, 10, 10 degrees [?] 
 Couple Ks, some had charms 
 I'm strictly Eagles, few suedes on 
 Next Friday I'm [?] 
 I gotta kill this nigga's head 
 He'll prolly do mine when nobody's there 
 Cause the only way to score, leave no witness 
 A thug on my shit list, pay him to slugs back 
 The slickest and remember that I built two graves 
 I wasn't stupid, I was ruthless 
 Check the bazooka crew, they bookoos 
 Broke the glass slammin' my rings down 
 That's doofus, don't mess up, you got the longest clip, use it 
 Yo you see 'em in the lobby, they right there 
 Headshots only, kill him, he right there
