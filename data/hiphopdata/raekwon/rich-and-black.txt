Sample: 
 And regardless to how much power you have 
 When God sends prophets and messengers 
 They don't care nothing about your power 
 Because they come from THE power 
 Nas: 
 Rare nigga, I'm a wonder, your best success is my worst blunder 
 Feds tapped the number 
 Jury Jacqueline Onassis could appreciate 
 Weed to alleviate the pain, Eddie Kane, Richard Pryor, pinky ring 
 Watch ya conduct nigga, full pardons for my niggaz that's livin' 
 You guessed it, models, y'all keep 'em if they anorexic 
 Love 'em but can't trust 'em 
 Hate 'em but won't bust 'em 
 Cake in the savings, spinning wisdom it's like a custom 
 Tats of Hieroglyphics, lipstick on the collar 
 I got more to lose than you do, but I'm a rider 
 When did the rules change? Y'all livin' trendy on pennies 
 Meetin' deadlines with ease, no gain 
 You fire, I'm butane, gave the Timbs ostrich belts 
 These are the times that I surprise myself 
 My niggaz lookin' like Black Crowes at packed shows 
 The don voice stay pristine like I'm still 17 
 Raekwon: 
 I'm rick, black, African, rockin' a golden mack 
 Trailing leather Gucci leggings on my back 
 Willied by some hoodlum in the trench 
 Rinse these niggaz, 86 gazelles, dicing their defense 
 Mike Tyson disciple, trifle with my pen, it's a rifle 
 16 ways to shoot you through your Chrysler duke 
 Exhalin' with niggaz the jails argue 
 Bring the best niggaz to the table, I'll sick 4 of my whales on you 
 Custom wooded speakers rock Elise's 
 Run from polices, dump on creatures, holidays with preachers 
 Stainless Steel watches ostrich turtlenecks, Here's the deal 
 If we can't come in, they can't have the field 
 Bones ya Sisco, murder instrumentals 
 Kanye porsche rap, how many horses live official? 
 I run with generals that flash Uzis in interviews 
 My shit is deep we fly swimming dude 
 Nas: 
 Verse 2 gotta be all murder just like the first verse 
 Timbs yellow like the hair on a Malibu surfer 
 Yellow like my Harry Winston glistenin' arm B 
 Yellow like New York City piss stained concrete 
 Raekwon: 
 That's right yo, who voted toastin' in the wind? 
 Las Vegas odors, what you know 
 Leave it right here, we go to the Lotus 
 Put a package on your head, be promoted 
 Keys in effect, paying these dumb fuckin' D's offa donuts 
 Sample: 
 I hate to see you acting like a slave 
 To get an advance here an advance there 
 Because somebody else controls your destiny. 
 Raekwon: 
 I'm rich, black, umbrella calico captain 
 Wes Craven with a blade and a black 
 From hood ornaments, junkies win awards in my tournaments 
 My shit is listed like informants pics 
 Ya know we order hits, planes fire, niggaz is sure to get ya 
 Whether in Costa Rica, Lisa she's sure to twist ya 
 Eatin chow lo mein with chopsticks, Glocks with aim 
 Watermelon chips, pop some pain 
 From all the riches niggaz forcing out they feelings kid 
 Whether in hallways or boats, now feel us kid 
 Out in Alaska in the Astons remember my passion 
 Hungry wolf who never eat in his castle 
 Bolivian connects wrestlers yeah 
 Chef ambidextrous, quick to back you in like the Lexus shit 
 Hunted by the FBI, we gracious 
 More demonstrations shit is tough 
 Milk it, carnation
