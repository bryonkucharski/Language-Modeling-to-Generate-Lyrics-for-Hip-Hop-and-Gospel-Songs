(French Montana) 
 My nigga Raekwon talkin', uh-huh 
 Everythin' you want you don't need 
 And don't believe everythin' you read 
 And only half what you see 
 (French Montana) 
 I said I won't, I don't need it, yeah 
 Don't believe everythin' you read, yeah 
 Only half what you see, yeah 
 Man, this shit is what it is, yeah, ooh 
 (French Montana) 
 It's "Hello", oh, Lord 
 When you're tryin' to bail out, who to call? 
 Your bitch turned down, this shit is love 
 Me and my niggas fill up, we goin' to war 
 We goin' to war (wall to wall) 
 My money's stacked up (wall to wall) 
 My shows' packed up (wall to wall) 
 Her ass stepped up (wall to wall) 
 Got my money up, we goin' to war 
 (French Montana) 
 Clear view, dark tints, hustle by the park bench 
 White top, blue tops, niggas I don't call friends 
 Till they called it love 
 Called my niggas, grabbed their hammers 
 'Bout to go to war 
 Prices on your head, I'm a spend it 
 Everythin' in that showroom, nigga, I was in it 
 On my son, I was in it, I was in it 
 Dirty money, ten chains, I be shinin' every minute 
 I'm shinin' every minute 
 Soft to the hard rock, Hard Rock Casino 
 Me and shorty watchin' Nino in the hardtop 
 I done counted ten mills when that ball dropped 
 Me and Chinx poppin' bottles out in Far Rock 
 (French Montana) 
 I said I won't, I don't need it, yeah 
 Don't believe everythin' you read, yeah 
 Only half what you see, yeah 
 Man, this shit is what it is, yeah, ooh 
 (French Montana) 
 It's "Hello", oh, Lord 
 When you're tryin' to bail out, who to call? 
 Your bitch turned down, this shit is love 
 Me and my niggas fill up, we goin' to war 
 We goin' to war (wall to wall) 
 My money's stacked up (wall to wall) 
 My shows' packed up (wall to wall) 
 Her ass stepped up (wall to wall) 
 Got my money up, we goin' to war 
 (Raekwon) 
 Frozen fishscale, you better go to Ishmael 
 Tiger-skin hammer, sittin' by the Benz grille 
 Knots of hundreds; it's lunch, kid, play fair 
 Say "yeah," feed your brother, be's a one, shit 
 Enough money to slum kids, kings with pillows 
 Leave your body, yo, under the dumpsters 
 Take money suitcases, bracelets, cake mix 
 Come out the hole, this is weight flicks 
 So much bread, we build lead houses 
 Run in the shed, see dead thousands 
 Faces, we call 'em big noses 
 Flashin' in the foreign shit 
 Grubbed up niggas is wasted 
 (French Montana) 
 I said I won't, I don't need it, yeah 
 Don't believe everythin' you read, yeah 
 Only half what you see, yeah 
 Man, this shit is what it is, yeah, ooh 
 (French Montana) 
 It's "Hello", oh, Lord 
 When you're tryin' to bail out, who to call? 
 Your bitch turned down, this shit is love 
 Me and my niggas fill up, we goin' to war 
 We goin' to war (wall to wall) 
 My money's stacked up (wall to wall) 
 My shows' packed up (wall to wall) 
 Her ass stepped up (wall to wall) 
 Got my money up, we goin' to war 
 (Busta Rhymes) 
 Yo, whip my feet up, gettin' manicures in a zap 
 And spectacular visuals 
 Niggas be camera-phonin' up my movement 
 Everythin' we do to sit and take precedents 
 While we go stackin' residuals 
 Niggas starvin' to know just how we do it 
 Absolutely be stayin' the money every night (Dracula) 
 Niggas, stay up in it like Jamaicans and stay in the maximum 
 Difficult to predict, I'm calculated like algebra 
 Cause the money traced back to them diamond mines out in Africa 
 We in the future with it though, closin' my eyes for pictures 
 Phone'd have me speak with holograms 
 When I'm buildin' with bitches 
 And then I bang 'em like body slammin', one-handin' 'em ishes 
 Like I was sellin' warheads and I'm baggage handlin' missiles 
 Fuck it, decided to blow an M just bein' silly 
 With a bob and a step and a charisma like I sit on a billi 
 And for the five percent with the science 
 And the ones that really get me 
 I got a lot to do with civilizin' and countin', I'm busy 
 (French Montana) 
 I said I won't, I don't need it, yeah 
 Don't believe everythin' you read, yeah 
 Only half what you see, yeah 
 Man, this shit is what it is, yeah, ooh 
 (French Montana) 
 It's "Hello", oh, Lord 
 When you're tryin' to bail out, who to call? 
 Your bitch turned down, this shit is love 
 Me and my niggas fill up, we goin' to war 
 We goin' to war (wall to wall) 
 My money's stacked up (wall to wall) 
 My shows' packed up (wall to wall) 
 Her ass stepped up (wall to wall) 
 Got my money up, we goin' to war 
 (Raekwon) 
 Salute, salute, yeah

 Word up, you know what it is, my nigga 
 Louis Rich right here, baby 
 Yeah, you know what this is, nigga
