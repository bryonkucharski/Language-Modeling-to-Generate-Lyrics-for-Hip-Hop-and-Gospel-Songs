 This is the wrong time - but I wish you were all mine 
 I ain't trying to wait, listen to fate 
 But what's a man to do? 
 Said I'm all confused and you ain't trying to choose 
 Whether I win or lose, baby 
 Yeah, it's all about you, all about you 
 It's all about you 
 Said it's all about you, all about you 
 Said it's all about you, all about you 
 Yeah, it's all about you, all about you 
 All about you

 It been about me, I'm a king from the rip 
 My own millionaire style, my swag on dip 
 Stay fresh in the freshest places 
 Flip papers, fly around, Bugattis and yachts 
 Holding knots, C.R.E.A.M relations 
 It's like hitting the lotto winning 
 More money, more problems you gotta be kidding 
 I'd rather sit up in the Bronx and parlay some shit up 
 I'm usually breaking down eights and slaying some sit-ups 
 Boo, it's tight times, let me hustle 
 'Cause everything you want, I'm near with all muscle 
 'Cause when I'm in the streets, we eating, more Ruffles 
 Then we can play the suits in Vegas, all duffles 
 'Cause you the queen, I'm the king, be a rider 
 A man with a game plan stressing, ain't a rider 
 So let me paint picture, stay crisp, we providers 
 We real, realer than real, word to mamas

 Kingpin chef in the town, keep it 100 
 Ice on his neck and his arms with more money 
 Jump into the 250 [?], getting blunted 
 Pockets carry more than a stack, we all frontin' 
 Rich black African, dons getting cheddar 
 Shorty knows better, let's blow, bring the Beretta 
 Showing off the vault, you walk, nigga, you're welcome 
 Or you can stay here and be rich with me and help 'em 
 I'm just crazy, fly slick intelligence 
 He play high, on the strips, and flip pelicans 
 My whole clique is in this bitch, 10 elephants 
 Who stay fresher than us? That's irrelevant 
 True, yeah, nothing but a G-thing 
 Whoa, yo, they be coming through, peep game 
 Boo, I know it's over baby, keep playing 
 Oops, I'm out of energy, street king
