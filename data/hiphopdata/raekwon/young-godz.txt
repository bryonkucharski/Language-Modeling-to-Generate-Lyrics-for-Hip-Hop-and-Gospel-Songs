 Older cats max with young godz who got the guns

 Out of town Big Willie niggaz best to run 
 Y'all the little y'all the youth coming up 
 Or get stung by the killer bee stinga from the slums 
 KnowhatI'msayin son? 
 Yo son 
 Of the young Shaolin Monks, chickenheads will get done 
 You the first man, you go first son 
 I'm Mobb Deep, in cherry Cherokees I forever be 
 On some thug shit, runnin' wild through New York City 
 Bustin' guns rockin' jew-els that shine like sun 
 Stapleton is where I'm from 
 And been down for years stayed on point like stairs (yeah, word up) 
 Cause the jealous motherfuckers want to end my career 
 I never feared, the ghetto is hell, but I learned ta 
 Keep my mouth shut and pack a nickel-plated burner 
 And squeeze, if I get front on my nine millimi 
 Will have my enemies, behind trees 
 Niggaz that think they live 'cause they puff a little lye 
 Pack a bullshit, twenty-five, nah don't think they'll kill us 
 Older cats mack, roll with young godz that got the guns 
 You right about that kid 
 Out of town Big Willie niggaz best to run 
 Now yo y'all just keep everything moving you know 
 Or get stung by the killer bee stinga from the slums 
 The beat is sounding like Star Trek 
 Of the young Shaolin Monks, taking heads, with the tongue 
 So yo, youknowhatI'msayin son? 
 Yo, deep in the ocean of the Atlantic, here comes the killa falcon 
 I meditate then swing with the force of mountains 
 Brain cells is able to be bi-debatable 
 When I think it's hazardous to your ozone layer 
 A premeditated killer plan so kill the Mayor, my silencer 
 Causes niggaz to hush, then I rush, like Manchus 
 Who guard jewels and collect, Cash Rules with heavy jewels 
 I live by name and cut veins 
 Burning bodies into flames 
 Between my anger, I lock down every chamber 
 Hillside strangler, a nigga with a mask like Lone Ranger 
 Rap poetic is injected into the brain athletic 
 Build off of rhymin' calisthenics 
 I'm determined, I raise a army like Hitler done Germans 
 And become the Allied commander, my enemies is catching on camera 
 They seek death, I begin to torture them (calm down kid take your time) 
 By giving butterfly stitches, bear witness 
 As I hang with Jehovah's Witnesses 
 Older cats max with young godz that got the guns 
 Out of town Big Willie niggaz best to run 
 Or get stung, by the killa bee stinga from the slums 
 From the young Shaolin Monks, taking heads with the tongue 
 Yo, yo, this is manslaughter, so what you want to do 
 Last year, you ran for the border with your crew 
 I flip, stacks, all the, time when I rhyme 
 Libra is my sign, and can't stand swine 
 When I dine, the automatic weapon 
 Got niggaz steppin', in the opposite direction 
 My jurisdiction, is off grounds to you clowns 
 My proposition, meaning you go round for round 
 Straight up and down, I broke the sound barrier 
 Scarier, than a tight skirt wrapped around a transvestite 
 The grammar, hype, nigga check your stacks 
 Or you'll be rhyming with a broke back 
 Niggaz talk about they rollin' deep up in here 
 The only way you roll is if you in a wheelchair 
 Older 
 Yo, y'all calm down man calm down calm down 
 Yeah, and yo 
 Now yo, youknowhatI'msayin? 
 I want to tell y'all 
 Y'all up under the restrictions of the Wu camp 
 Aiyyo Rae, you got Killa Sin 
 YouknowhatI'msayin? 
 Madman, Shyheim the Rugged Child 
 So just take your time and handle life as it comes 
 Motherfuckin' Rubbabandz, the young godz comin' through 
 Cause the real nigga gonna know what they gotta do 
 Showin' and provin' youknowhatI'msayin? Shaolin forever 
 Yo, may all the bullshit cease, increase the war fuck the peace 
 Make shit hot like rockin' tube socks at Jones Beach 
 N the summer, number one gunner run for cover 
 Keep 'em steppin' with more Lethal Weapons than Danny Gloves 
 I cock back, action packed raps and gats 
 Niggaz trade mats for prats people react, to RZA sharp tracks 
 Another day nother body dropped you better keep your shottie cocked 
 For actin' snotty Hobbes catch karate chops 
 Cause Wu-Tang live, forever and a day 
 You better pray for better ways to get away when my Beretta spray 
 We never play with commercialism 
 The hardcore rhythm give 'em more hell than an exorcism 
 My terrordome be a clever poem let it be known 
 I'm packin' chrome and rollin' phatter than eleven bones 
 My crew's sicker than that AIDS shit 
 While others get played quick, 'cause we be making hits through the grave sift 
 My right hand man, myself and the Clan 
 Gun and mic stands reverses help me see my first a hundred grand 
 And to my Physical one love power crazy real 
 For all them carbon copy niggaz lurkin' in the rap deal
