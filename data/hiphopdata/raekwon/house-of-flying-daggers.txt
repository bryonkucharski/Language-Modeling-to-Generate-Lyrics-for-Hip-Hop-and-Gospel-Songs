Intro Chinese sample 
 Inspectah Deck 
 Hehehehe, nobody is going to save you now 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yo, yo 
 Inspectah Deck 
 I pop off like a mobster boss 
 Angel hair with the lobster sauce, summertime can't top the scorch 
 Check my hot broad, I dropped the Porsche 
 FBI wanna watch the force, trying to lock my source 
 Where I'm from, hear the macs, techs, glocks and fours 
 Hide the safe, nigga, lock the doors 
 No respect for the cops and laws 
 In the land where your own blood brother still plot for yours 
 Seen things that'll drop your jaw 
 My soldiers got dropped in war, see the mural on the project wall? 
 Won't stop till I copped them all 
 Wanna block me? You gots to brawl, tray shots and all 
 'Cause I ain't on the clock for talk 
 The Spot Rusher, blow down the spot for sure 
 Still break off the block with raw, my stock is more 
 The General, watch your board 
 Raekwon: 
 Deep pockets with the eight on me, sleep with the safe in the wall 
 The cameras on with the make-up and all 
 Swap six 45's, twist reefer in the flicks, papi whoadie ride 
 Bolt his gun off, from know your horse, she lied 
 Fly criteria, bury me in Africa 
 With whips and spears, and rough diamonds out of Syria 
 A true don, only I could do wrong 
 Rock fitted hats, get crack money and drive a sick blue joint 
 Retard-less, I'mma blow regardless 
 Resume is straight up live, I shank niggas up for larger E's 
 And speak with the youth in the spot, eat the fresh fruit in the crop 
 All these hip hoppers eat cock 
 You can see me in the street or the yacht 
 I'd rather be promoting your block or buying fresh sneakers with gwops 
 Yo, I'm an ill dude, always been a real dude 
 Don't fuck around, I will spill on you and kill you in the field, boo 
 Chorus :GZA 
 Soldiers in the front, let the heat pump 
 Troops on the left, fight to the death 
 Fam on the right, infrared lights 
 Wolves in the back, ready to attack, for what 
 Ghostface Killah 
 Leather jackets on, rocked up rock stars 
 Treacherous bank robbers, the plan gold up, we pop guards 
 The team gotta eat, seeds is hungry, that's why we ain't scared 
 To dump on niggas, our guns is chunky 
 Usually we bust niggas down with bats, swell up they joints 
 Elbow, wrists, they shins get cracked 
 We still humiliate, brutalize, Ruger pop, pulverize 
 Still got gear in the closet, that's stupid live 
 From Benetton rugby skullies, Oshkosh conductor jumpers 
 The train hats fit me lovely 
 Rae job is to make sure the coke is fluffy 
 While I politic his birthday bash with Puffy 
 Bagged Nia soon as I linked up, the kid ain't inked up 
 I'm an old mummy, my gold weigh as much as King Tut (yeah, yeah) 
 Slippers, robes is minked up, under the doorag, bro (uh, yo, yo) 
 My three dimensional fade is clean cut 
 Method Man 
 Man, ya niggas ain't shit to us, still a pistol bust 
 Split your melon like I split the Dutch 
 Got a lot of piff to puff, and I ain't come for fisticuffs 
 Or for the cop that wanna clip the cuffs 
 Man, is Staten in this bitch or what, don't get it twisted, we 
 Twist it up and even mixed with dust 
 See these fans can't resist the rush, they Wu-Tang for life 
 Scarred for life, they can't forget the cuts 
 Got a whole line of classic joints, and while you at it 
 Pass the joint, let's push this music past the point 
 Of no return, till they crash and burn, down the ashes 
 Then placed inside Ol' Dirty Bastard's urn 
 When it's my time to go, for sure, ya nigga goes to war 
 What you think I brought these soldiers for? 
 To send shot like forget me not, at any nigga 
 Respect, bitch, that figure they gon' get me got 
 Chinese Sample 
 Hehe, your basic kung fu is no good 
 You can't move fast enough 
 And you don't have enough strength 
 And your body movements are like a string climb 
 It's too easy for me to trip you up 
 (Fighting) 
 Hehehe, how's it feel, huh? 
 It's no fair, I'm afraid my back is broken 
 Hahaha, you still got a lot to learn
