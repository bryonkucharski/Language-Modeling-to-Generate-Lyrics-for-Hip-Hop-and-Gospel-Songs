(Intro: Raekwon) 
 Yo 
 What up man 
 What's good 
 Gimme the joint man 
 Yeah, nigga hold this money right here 
 We already got it knocked out ya know 
 Don't stress it 
 We good 
 "Niggaz got mad coke inside a Luvs... Luvs Pamper box nigga" 
 Ya niggaz is stupid 
 Raekwon: 
 That nigga pussy doin' pig Latin 
 He can't come to the hood 
 Might kill him off top up in the Staten 
 Son think he better than niggaz 
 I think his rebels is resentful 
 Tried to kill him in his rental 
 He had an Idi Amin approach 
 Hittin the roach, had a hunger face 
 He drove his mom's 7 in the ocean 
 He's a wild cowboy slangin' heron 
 Who rock a dead arm 
 Knock a DEA agent out his Chevron 
 All of his Eli's machette'd up stainless 
 (Sample) 
 Never heard nothing, all you hear is the guns bangin' 
 Rockin' pastel blazers with a shorty from Iceland 
 Who old dad put 'em up on white sand 
 Starving to make a wack debut he came through the lobby 
 Three culture Devilles with him, a whitey 
 This pathetic, braggin' monkey face faggot deaded 
 Comin' through the stairs with blow in his mouth, desperate 
 Watchin' him lookin' stupid, son know we on foot patrol 
 Come through the hole, niggaz is swoopin' 
 700 shots, all leather gloves, 6 thugs 
 Two had a mask on, they took 'em off what 
 We got you now nigga knowin' you down 
 Niggaz is foul, this is trauma king, by any means baow 
 They pushed his face in, fell out his Saconies 
 Snatched his homeys, took his Glock 
 You gonna be my Tenderonies? 
 Lloyd Banks: 
 Metal exchanges, the hoods a gun range 
 Everybody's a target, depending on how you aim 
 Dice games and ice chains, pennants spellin' your name 
 OG's settin' the wrong example, tellin' the same 
 Look at Shorty Shit Stain, grew up to be a fuckin' mess 
 Before his clique came 
 He banged and never tucked his chest 
 Project full of them thangs he caught the gun connect 
 Ridin' round with A and Lou, Nino when they want respect 
 Son cold, Nino want to show 
 Everybody know they straight shippin' hood bitches to the bungalow 
 Pillow talking led to birds talking 
 Chattin' bout what happened and when and where they comin' back in 
 Champagne slackin' traffickin' while they travel 
 Word got back at old time friends and snakes rattled 
 Two different 'burbans but the one that dropped the birds got tailed 
 Information for the ones who light the steel got mill. 
 Pussy power made the plans sour 
 Apartment full of party powder outside a stakeout for hours 
 Click clacks from big gats and rags 
 Soon as the door squeaks they runnin' up on the grass 
 BANG FLASH shots right on path, broken glass 
 Comedy of laughs while they haul ass with the bags 
 Legends in my hood play back 
 Twin Benz's whippin' in black 
 And that was like the old Maybach
