(Sample: Winston Churchill) 
 Now we are the masters of our fate 
 That the task which has been set us is not above our strength 
 That it's pangs and toils are not beyond our endurance 
 As long as we have faith in our cause and an unconquerable will-power 
 Salvation will not be denied us 
 Salvation will not be denied us 
 Salvation will not be denied us 
 We are the masters of our fate 
 Long as we have faith, an unconquerable will-power 
 Salvation will not be denied us 
 (Verse 1: Raekwon) 
 The time has come, I've just begun, this is designer rum 
 My wallet got flowers on it, kill it cowards 
 From the land, the stolen land, where gold chains control a man 
 Three hundred holding hands, stolen grams 
 I play the phantom, waving, 
 Leave that nigga for dead, or should I save him 
 Spitting out phlegm, no, just grave them 
 I remember days, I used work for niggas, eat jerk with niggas 
 Buying whip, is laughing and joking, trying to flip 
 Clip is loyal, fly spoil on the block, display royal 
 Even though we go back to royals, black oils 
 Live as ever, can't tell me nothing, whatever 
 This thing of ours, is empowered by my niggas who pumping 
 Twenty four hours of slang motion, wave brush 
 Ya knew my hair was the ocean, running through the building 
 Just negation, some of the creeps 
 Knew me very well, knew he would sell, knew he was potent

 (Verse 2: Black Thought) 
 OK, bridges I burn some, lessons I learn some 
 Money, I spent some, lent some, earn some 
 My eyes tell it, tell her the hell I return from 
 Spark up an L from the homeys I haven't heard from 
 Burn when the herbs come, I'm living large 
 Never chilling on the curb, just a villain on the verge, son 
 My tenth shot is as efficient as the third one 
 Second one, first one, worse come to worse run 
 When I was pushed out the womb, the Earth spun 
 The only way to describe this is inertia 
 Some rappers think they can try me, who the first up? 
 I don't guarantee no survivors, niggas, surf's up 
 Yeah, soul on ice, courage is sacrifice 
 Hold on tight, and save your laughter for the afterlife 
 These chumps thinking they good, ain't even half as nice 
 Your fate'll be a one way ticket to paradise, what?

 Salvation will not be denied us 
 In the words of the Psalmist 
 "He shall not be afraid of evil tidings 
 His heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord."
