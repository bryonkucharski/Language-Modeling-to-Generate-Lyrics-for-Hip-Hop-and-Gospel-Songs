Another day, another dollar 
 I got mines, ain't got nothing to father 
 Fuck a role model, never had one to follow 
 Lot of cotton mouth rappers, I'm a hard one to swallow 
 Here's another hard one to goggle, fuck your life, that's the motto 
 I'm nice with mics, 'Cause D'Amato 
 Drug related, blunt guts all up in your condo 
 Hate a noisy woman, why you all up in my convo 
 Let me hold something, look at you killas, like you owe something 
 Stole something, give me my paper, 'fore I blow something 
 Right now, give me my fucking shit, chicka-blaow 
 I want it right now, give me my fucking shit, chicka-blaow 
 Shady niggas hiding the loot, you see my baby needs shoes 
 And the record label trynna recoup 
 I want it right now, give me my fucking shit, chicka-blaow 
 And I mean right now, give me my fucking shit, chicka-blaow 
 Gun battles, so many chains on the neck 
 Hands and feet, niggas say I'm Shaq 
 Sky blue, terry cloth, low pullover 
 Hit ten like a 2010 new Hova 
 Movies on, never ran it, call me a don 
 Been shitting everywhere, cause niggas can't stand it 
 Terminate faggots who violate us a square 
 Goon therapy, S.I., we don't fight fair 
 Beef? We can get it on, right here 
 And that includes y'all low niggas wearing tight gear 
 Sun God, and that's your target, aim right there 
 My money long and green like Buzz Lightyear 
 I'm all right here, the way I move the blow 
 Fuck a show, you would think it was an all white affair 
 Been fuego, more fire here, then you seen me 
 Getting money off the water like a pall bearer there 
 No Newports, Marlboro's here, go smoke that 
 The smoke in your face, bitch, I ain't never cared 
 Get shot down when the Ghost smell fear, let me hold something 
 Look in your face like you owe something 
 I'm playing for the 'bucks' like Hakeem Warrick 
 Nickel bag in the park, my team on it 
 They want it like that and the street, is dry as a well 
 Hell, that's why I sell crack on the beat 
 I ain't trynna just happen to eat, I'm a make a nigga dance 
 Even if I got to clap in the street 
 This is something like lock up, murder behind bars 
 A warrior, my story defined by my scars 
 Seven thirty verbal, my word work circle 
 You a jerk, fool, I burn you like your birds do
