(Chorus - Kobe) 
 Hey little mama, little mama, I got some of that Bon Jovi 
 You know me 
 Have you flying in the air like you living on the pent house 
 We on the corner serving that rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll 
 Posted on the corner with that rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll 
 (Verse 1 - Raekwon) 
 Willy Nelson nigga, you run flush, the crocodile hat 
 Cowboy rap, hammer game trustee 
 Diamonds on from Ghana, Boca Ratona, yeah 
 With the middle name Lex, pop my llama 
 Movies get made in HD, Mick and Jay they so three 
 I'm a Scarface to scrape me 
 There's nothing you could do to my real niggas 
 Not the ones I rest my head with, my sons'll milk a piranha 
 Two wheel scooters, the new Rugers 
 Floating through the Beverly summer 
 Counting ten with my shooter 
 All of these is high power, bard dealing style my nigga 
 Posted up, then fronting to Mr. Child 
 Titanium hustler, switch color 
 Most of them rich brothers'll hold they own 
 Fuck it, and switch numbers 
 Loved just the real shit, who killed shit? 
 Niggas is nothing, blow a blunt, repeal shit 
 (Bridge - Kobe) 
 Hey little mama, have you ever took a hit of Mick Jagger? 
 Yeah, better we'll blast you 
 Now take a hit of this rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll 
 It's some powerful shit 
 (Verse 2 - Ghostface Killah) 
 Everything platinum, even my baggage 
 You want a platinum rock? Then go see Ladin 
 He got the yellow hat, yellow Max Airs 
 Looking like me, with a yellow back, pretty long hair 
 Suck a dick like a rich stepping 
 Or Bobby Brown on speed dial, his ex girl stay on the check 
 I got that Mickey baby! 
 Little mama, I got the bomb, call me Tom Brady! 
 Move like a running back, 21 Tomlinson 
 Know how to push a pack, you should pay homage 
 Shit is too old, nigga feel like rhyming it 
 Get black, white, Mexicans 
 Make me fly like Donovan 
 Pop the champagne for the illest hustler in the game 
 I got the Pink Floyd, Ozzy all day 
 I ain't even mention my deals nigga 
 Because I don't want to have you freaked out over this real shit 
 (Verse 3 - Jim Jones) 
 Rockstar like the Red Hot Chili Peppers 
 I can't front because Roy Drop got me feeling extra 
 I drop the top so I can show style 
 I got the sours on Rolling Stone 
 I'm dropping shit on my mobile phone 
 I never slip because I keep a fully loaded chrome 
 And half my niggas even stay at that 
 Before we pour liquor for the 'grateful dead' 
 And where I'm from it's even Guns 'N' Roses 
 And fuck with me you need a bunch of roses 
 And Lord knows I keep the Led Zeppelin 
 A nigga front and then we bag wrestle 
 And you can tell them bitches feel at ease 
 We got that white girl, nigga Cheryl E 
 Diplomats, we the eagles 
 We finna be grated into Beetles
