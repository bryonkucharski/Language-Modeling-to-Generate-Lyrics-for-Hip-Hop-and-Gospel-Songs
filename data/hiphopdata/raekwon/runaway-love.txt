Visual visual JB 
 Yo 'Ye whattup 
 Raekwon 
 You got stacks like the international house of pancakes 
 All alone ready to phone me and your hand shakes 
 Palms is sweat it, don't regret 
 Never the walk miles for love I sit at starters deck 
 It just happens I was floating you seen it captain? 
 Blinked at me then I threw on my thinking cap 
 Taker, and then we can slide to Jamaica 
 Shopping for a year or two stop in Diego 
 It's obvious I'm gon sue your mommy is 
 We just friends so she can't Clyde Bonnie us 
 Fly walls down in the fly halls 
 Come to the master suite leave every piece in the master hall 
 All about money tied in a know stand over there 
 That's why I make it happen on blocks 
 Brazil cut sweater, Audi, leather 
 Playing the field tryna outslug Berretta 
 You see my baby over hit the road 
 Where she's going I swear nobody knows 
 I need to find her before another man does 
 I wouldn't want him to steal my love 
 I'm just tryin' to be cool, cool, cool (tryn'a be cool) 
 What would you expect me to do (oh oh oh, oh oh oh, yeah) 
 I'm just tryin' to find, find, find 
 That sweet love of mine 
 I'm runnin' outta time 
 Where is my runway love 
 Searching low and high 
 Know that I'm not givin' up 
 I give it all up for her 
 I'll never be enough 
 I won't stop until I find 
 My runaway love 
 Last name West and my teeth Diamonds 
 She said yo what's your occupation, crazy rhyming? 
 Listen to Wu Tang 
 Trying crazy suits on 
 Stuntin' in our high top Louie's 
 Shorts is the coogies 
 Open up the door when you take her to the movies 
 When you meet the parents you tell De Niro 
 Her boyfriend is zero she needs to cut the weirdo 
 Next show they gotta up the zeroes 
 Nobody rocking like this sixty years old 
 The hard johns and the Walleys something caught me 
 I'm telling you what Wu-Tang taught me 
 The young youth rocking the gold tooth 
 Pull up in a drop top old school bumping the cash rules 
 No question we the reason why the summers blazin' 
 You looking good fly color Asian 
 Ra I give it yo ya, no trivia 
 She used to roll with my G-unit like Olivia 
 Till she caught me getting numbers not her's 
 (Sweet runaway love) 
 Guess that's the day she became a runaway love 
 I'm runnin' outta time 
 Where is my runaway love 
 Searching low and high 
 Know that I'm not givin' up 
 I give it all up for her 
 I'll never be enough 
 I won't stop until I find 
 My runaway love 
 Why can't I find, the love of mine, 
 When you're standing in front of my face 
 Oh why (oh why), You must be mine 
 How did I let you get away 
 Leave it up to the most high sit in a ghost fly 
 Chillin' with two of my brothers we both live on deck 
 Grabbing 'em on set 
 This is how we roll independence she a go I'm gon go get 
 Take that queen assure to ya 
 We can live every month baby girl just call me up 
 Waking up mess in some cold sweats thinking of this the video tapes 
 Even the stress 
 My mind is a terrible thing to waste 
 No love lost I know I'm going crazy I can't floss 
 Me my lady left my homies 
 It's all baloney just like rocking an old pony 
 So when I chillin' I'm just lost no more feeling 
 I need my honey in my life get that film it 
 Take the time Rae Just and Ye shine 
 My runaway love give me mine come on 
 I'm runnin' outta time 
 Where is my runaway love 
 Searching low and high 
 Know that I'm not givin' up 
 I give it all up for her 
 I'll never be enough 
 I won't stop until I find 
 My runaway love 
 I'm runnin' outta time 
 Where is my runaway love 
 Searching low and high 
 Know that I'm not givin' up 
 I give it all up for her 
 I'll never be enough 
 I won't stop until I find 
 My runaway love
