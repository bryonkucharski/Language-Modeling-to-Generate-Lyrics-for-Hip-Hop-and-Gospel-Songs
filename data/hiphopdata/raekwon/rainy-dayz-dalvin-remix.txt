(Blue Raspberry) These rainy days... 
 (Raekwon) Doin' this for nineteen ninety-six 
 Revolution is a trick, be aware 
 Verse One: Raekwon 
 Yo, yo, yo 
 I run with rich rap cats who run corners 
 They run through alleys, navy blue Bally's at the grand finale 
 Still in all, currency catches the eye of the youth 
 On top, playin' on three corners of the roof 
 So we accept that, jettin at nights 
 Don't ever wet that, drop the G-pack how will I eat black 
 And brothers, flexin labels like cables 
 White Sables, pressin up, tryin' to make a debut 
 Hard times, when the God rhyme, I maim the minds 
 Because he playin' mines close 
 We ain't related 'cause he raided mine 
 They see me lampin up in 850's 
 With 360's, blowin' like 160 sellin fifties 
 Due to the wicked, dice should never lie 
 Now that's a damn lie, provin on standby, man why? 
 The game, I mentally tear down the brain 
 Half of us'll feel the pain, big boy, let it rain 
 I guess my whole team is marvelous 
 Street life novelist, let it rain dunn, swallow this 
 Word up, so you know 
 When I take you there you just add on to this (let it rain dunn, swallow this) 
 Chorus: Raekwon (singing) 
 You know how to love me 
 Makes me feel so good (let it rain let it rain) 
 You know how to -- you know how to love me *laughter* 
 Makes me feel so good -- Flex my voices right, it's on knowhatI'msayin? 
 Verse Two: Raekwon the Chef 
 Guess down, the crazy new appar' just for the new year 
 Wavy hair plus, we get much 'cause we on the air 
 Cristal whylin my medallion, stylin it's like city island 
 Relax kid, while shorty profilin 
 Until then, we got to bend with the wind 
 Plus build again, writin my friends sendin 'em linen tims 
 I'm tired of robberies, pornography 
 Throw a pair, Wally's on poach for live nigga pho-tography 
 Chorus: Raekwon (singin') 
 You know how to love me 
 Makes me feel so good 
 Verse Three: Ghostface Killer 
 Yo, yo 
 Check out the handshake fake niggaz rockin' the toupee 
 Frontin on me and Chef, yo it's dog day 
 Afternoon I'm blowin' up your weak platoon 
 Leave you helpless, screamin from all types of wounds 
 I be the expert, blowin' like a firework 
 Covertin concepts that will nerve-wreck in concert 
 'Cause I write, and blast and slash your whole level 
 I'm holy God I be challengin pros for gold medals 
 Whatever, still remain sturdy like a leather 
 On Friday's, get your fresh pay, from a better 
 Represent, my lifestyle is in like Flynn 
 Mili-tinted God shit is very masculine 
 Mad tuff, Razor bust stuff with nuff said 
 Ex-dust said, now puttin' heads to bed 
 Call me a legend, flexin with the style of old 
 Carryin loads of loot, mad rich buryin gold 
 Sabotage, thoughts of livin' large any day now 
 The land to satisfy the whole garage 
 Back to the morrow, soon to make a novel 
 Born to be, sellin like Marvel Comic books for my survival 
 Beware, I'm hittin like a snare from the Delphonics 
 Crushin niggaz I be blowin' like egg-onomics 
 Washed up, you're fuckin' with a daily error 
 No fat, niggaz be jettin when they face terror 
 Check it out y'all, all the fly chicks, yeah 
 Check it out yo, all the fly chicks, you know I dig your back out 
 Word up word up but check it out it's still china 
 Word up, one time y'all 
 (New York, New York that's the temple, knowhatI'msayin?) 
 (Georgia) Carolinas, Mexica 
 Mexico, Canada, word up 
 Baltimore, BA, plus Philly and Boston 
 Mississippi, and Chicago, no doubt no doubt 
 Word up, Michigan Michigan
