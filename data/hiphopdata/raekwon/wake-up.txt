(One) gun go off, showin' everything is lost 
 (Two) hold between me and you, these the rules, c'mon 
 (Three) yo, we gotta stand together to take cream'n 
 (Four) without me and you the crew just could never be 
 Imaginative mental, blood flyin' 
 The most hardest niggas cock they iron 
 Foul, live like a Lion 
 Listen to the streets and your gun go off 
 Sorta like a show off 
 Jungle way of livin', hittin' dro off 
 Lifestyle changes niggas see that 
 They gettin' anxious just to throw one in your ski hat 
 Watch your language, yeah, you fresher than a Million bucks 
 You got a new hustle, you hardly knew niggas would envy lust 
 They gettin' hungrier and niggas bust 
 They lit a bigger dutch 
 Fixin' them Calicos to dig your guts 
 Detectives roam 
 Niggas come home and got a bigger dome 
 Ready to zone on what a nigga own 
 Caught in the mischief 
 How can you live when it's a sickness 
 That sorrounds that projects and the trenches 
 Walkin' through the bushes at night 
 You gotta be sharp like a butcher knife 
 Subtly show up when the jooks is right 
 And everything will have a major like 
 Whether it's black or white 
 Nobody knows until they snatch your life 
 Wake up son, the season's just a thing the mind make up 
 It's only real kid, ha, wake up! 
 The meat market pardon me, the heat market 
 Chill, we got it on lock, the nigga got to sweet talkin' 
 I gotta eat and got the beast targeted 
 Relax, my Brothers on 'role, niggas got police barkin' 
 They want us killed, sieze the sargent 
 Blowin' each cartridge 
 We ill, realer in each market 
 Feel the leather jacket, sleek ostrich 
 Unleash the arsonist, just popped the wig off of each hostage 
 Make it real and make his niece watch it 
 Yokin' Grandmothers up, we kill until his peeps squash it 
 Verse is somethin' mean regardless 
 A green jar of harvest 
 Just smoke, niggas got the green Garcia's 
 A terrifying team of heartless 
 Move on the Narcs's 
 We only on it for extreme profits 
 And anyway we dream darkness 
 I saw it through the Jean Paul Gotier mint green gleam optics 
 So wake up Son, the season's just a thing the mind make up 
 It's only real kid, ha, wake up. 
 A message from Elijah's kids 
 My eyes opened, got wise on the biz 
 Start risin' my wig 
 Seen everything I saw before 
 Had dreams behind a wall 
 All I wanted was to balance my all 
 Make it through feedin' my kind 
 Readin' the lines 
 On how the dollar bill is shaped and designed 
 Taught from the Eighties 
 Talk, build, and protect all Babies 
 Strong shelters with strong Ladies 
 A nigga died, died amongst Daisies 
 He did it for the Babies 
 That's peace, feed 'em if they gettin' lazy.
