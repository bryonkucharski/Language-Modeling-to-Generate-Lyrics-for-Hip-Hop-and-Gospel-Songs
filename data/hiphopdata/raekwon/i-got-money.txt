(Raekwon) 
 Straight max, burgundy Lex, swing a few bats 
 I'm Gretzky, hockey mask on in the 'jects, yo 
 I'm eating like Hortons, Gorton's fisherman hat 
 A wristband flooded, Jew-jeweler selection 
 It's obvious I blow shit up 
 Keep gun smoking, yo, jump in a boat doin' a buck 
 Hundred sons bagging XK Jags 
 Brawler face, meatloaf your man up in the back of the wagon 
 Drugs equal money, money equals sunny days 
 Timbs, cut off shorts and gorgeous with a ton of haze 
 Bank book crook, yo, I'm looking 
 Brooklyn style, go 'head and juggle here, goonie's gon' book you 
 It's like a tunnel when it's hard to get in 
 You the target, the hardest niggas know when to win 
 We in the corners, all eaters, bottles of Seagrams 
 OG shit, now my niggas will peace you, what 
 I got the money that the banks can't hold 
 I got money, na na na na na 
 I got money, na na na na na 
 I got money, na na na na na 
 I got the money that the banks can't hold 
 I got money, na na na na na 
 I got money, na na na na na 
 I got money, na na na na na 
 (A$AP Rocky) 
 This ain't a bitch ass boom-bap 
 It's click-clack, move back 
 On 40th and Lennox where them killers and goons at 
 The Boogie Down Bronx is where my family moved at 
 I made it out the slums and I'll be damned if we move back 
 Where killers knew rap, and niggas get jewels snatched 
 My niggas on the runway with bandanas and doo-rags 
 Jiggy since the perm, Raf Simmons with 2 straps 
 I kick it with my niggas in the building and move packs 
 The money I be making kinda sacred, don't say it 
 Just make sure you save it, thank God that you made it 
 Taxes, pay it - the bullshit, save it 
 The blueprint, I laid it - the radio, they play it 
 So relay it, replay it then rate it but truth debate it 
 Relate it, best way to [?] it, but you too afraid to say it 
 They hatin', they claim we affiliate with Satan 
 But it's cool like ice, keep it skatin', amen 
 I got the money that the banks can't hold 
 I got money, na na na na na 
 I got money, na na na na na 
 I got money, na na na na na 
 I got the money that the banks can't hold 
 I got money, na na na na na 
 I got money, na na na na na 
 I got money, na na na na na 
 (Raekwon) 
 This how it's going down 
 You already know what we do man 
 Shit is classy, shit is real reluctant, real fly 
 The pursuit of perfection nigga 
 Chef, A$AP. Shout out the Mob nigga, ha ha 
 Yeah, Ice H20 
 The golden city, yeah nigga, ha ha 
 Yeah, do that shit, do that shit 
 Do that shit, do that shit, do it 
 Do that shit, do it 
 Do that shit 
 I got the money that the banks can't hold 
 I got money, na na na na na 
 I got money, na na na na na 
 I got money, na na na na na
