My life, day one when I was caught up in it young 
 Benetton sweaters, Kangols and guns 
 The candy shop is where it all popped 
 Sellin' ounces of oregano, free lunch, the spot 
 Thinkin' all better, can't wait to bag this block 
 'Cause when I get on, my ass is just rock 
 Do a few 1-2s and shop 
 I get whore who's runnin' through 5th Ave, a Glock 
 I love Polo Gear and top 
 A few Woolrich pieces, yeah the [?] was hot 
 Dreams and schemes to make a knot 
 I sat on the stove and wrote "C.R.E.A.M.," one blunt 2 o'clock 
 Gangsta hours if I'm not 
 I'm lyin', take a shot, I put it on my 40K rock 
 Shorty with an educated bop 
 With flavor for days, it's all praise, who amaze you a lot 
 x2 
 Front out of drug buildings under the street lights 
 Guns go off, we keep pipes 
 Every kid caught in the zone, let's hope he make it home 
 And sleep right, instead of churnin' the heat night 
 Ayo maxin' with the machine guns, new [?] 
 Tryna stay away from the jail gangs and letters 
 My time is now, bread box is startin' to pile 
 Homegirl got no style but I'ma lace her 
 Catch me in a Blazer with a P9 laser 
 Drunk get 25 thousand a razor 
 Meet me in the mess hall, you crazy, I'm out in Jamaica 
 Breakin' up black weed, chillin' with gangstas 
 Fuck around high, might die on vacation 
 Better have respect in the right place like Mike Mason 
 Everybody smooth when the cake flip 
 Niggas start snitchin' on the team whe they say shit 
 Get your face lit, it's so hard to make shit 
 Can't sit around jealous niggas, that's gay shit 
 That's why, yo I'm just around paid shit 
 No Minute Maid shit, no son this ain't a slave ship 
 x2 
 Front out of drug buildings under the street lights 
 Guns go off, we keep pipes 
 Every kid caught in the zone, let's hope he make it home 
 And sleep right, instead of churnin' the heat night
