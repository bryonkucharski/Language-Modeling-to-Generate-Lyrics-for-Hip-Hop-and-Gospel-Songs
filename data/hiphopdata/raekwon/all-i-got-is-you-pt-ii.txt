Straight up, c'mon Bub, I need you man 
 Yo, Straight up y'all 
 Yo Ghost I love you man 
 You know how we do this right here 
 We do this for our family 
 See you soon kid 
 (Verse One) 
 The greatest thing a kid could have 
 To chill with his family, sit back layin on his Dad 
 Props go out, next thing you know Pops roll out 
 Moms cussed him out, get the fuck out 
 Couldn't understand it, feelings turnin' to hard granite 
 Now she a one single parent 
 Growin' up on welfare, she might need healthcare 
 That made me feel no one else cares 
 Moms is a part of my life forever 
 Gettin' drunk that's her business guess that's stormy weather 
 Fish and grits, twelve o' clock midnight pissed 
 Stop cryin Ma take a kiss 
 Take care of ya brother and sis 
 Something happen to me I miss ya better be offic (official) 
 She meant that shit, every mouthful accurate 
 Took me to school be emaculate 
 Taught by the best, remember stress 
 A ghetto agenda that's how we rest 
 Don't let'em play with your emotions 
 Lotioning me, little money in my vest 
 Damn, Mom going through it 
 Still holding me through it 
 Sneaker money fucked up 
 Yo, Yeah when Granddaddy died 
 I know you didn't see me cry 
 Held it in, it hurted Ma alot 
 Remember, Bucs had me in a tux 
 Went to beef stake Charlie's had my first pay cut 
 Yeah, lovin' you always screamin on janitors in hallways 
 It's my son always 
 Caught me in the crib yo, smokin' 
 Sat me down heart broken, hopin the phase had me open yo 
 You like, hey yo, for real you like lovin' you for life it's only right 
 Strong yourself we make it 
 Weak minded you naked 
 The pain and hurt I can't take it 
 Plus my Uncle in jail 
 That's your brother go see him, he look forward to it like mail 
 You my ace, you the lady in the place 
 You ain't a waste, we just trapped inside a low-life place 
 Trust me I'm gonna work hard 
 Tatto my body, throw it on top where I got scars 
 See it son, start cryin 
 (Singing)
