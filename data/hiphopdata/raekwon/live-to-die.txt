Ayo gas station Sammy, rich nigga live in Miami 
 They killed him and lived with his family 
 He was drunk spazzin' on a young nigga with cash 
 They did the best to him, whooped his ass 
 Bloody out, his ear was ripped, they know he loved his music 
 They poked him twice, his gear was ripped 
 Ninja style, niggas whipped him with a Benz belt, broke his arm 
 Crushed his Audemars with whelps 
 On his face, they was slappin' him, fake ass rapper 
 Old ass gun, pussy get Tinactin 
 Medicine face, nigga, they opened his mouth 
 A few gold fell out, wheel him out 
 He thinkin' he a gangsta? Quit playin', listenin' to Sid and them 
 Because he sat up in bed to bid with 'em 
 Fishcakes, bubblegum shrimps in his Timbs 
 He had 12 and a half on, only wore 10 
 Niggas is lame, and I'm sayin' 
 All that hard, no damn frame, how you playin'? 
 Thought you bubble with the big Willies, flyin' in fast cars 
 And get busy, now he sittin' there lookin' dizzy 
 Don't look at Chef, nigga look at your rep 
 What dinosaur game you playin'? They playin' death 
 Tax man comin', you can feel it 
 Besides, hold the ratchets in both arms 
 They gave it to him, peel it

 Indian Femi from Toronto 
 Him and his horse, [?], two wild sopranos 
 Runnin' through ice, and niggas fall back 
 They bumped in the crunch, [?] 
 Used to wash them niggas up for chump change 
 Somethin' was strange, feds was listenin', ran out of the gun range 
 Son I feel vibes, not knowin' this was the time 
 To get away, but they rolled on alive 
 Black freeze out of the bushes, [?] 
 Big three pound, four of them were beams 
 When they rushed him they cuffed him, we cussed them 
 Yo what the fuck? You doin' life, lil' nigga, who the sucker, what? 
 Black was mad, he went for the cop's mag 
 They started [?], the shot rang, that's bad 
 Black fellow was [?], like 33 Ds 
 Let off 100 shots, went mad 
 x2 
 Kill niggas, let it die, live with the feelings
