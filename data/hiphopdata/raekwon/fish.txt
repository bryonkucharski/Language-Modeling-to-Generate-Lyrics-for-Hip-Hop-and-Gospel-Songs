These are the men who lead the crime families of America 
 I control 26,000 men. Except for dope, we operate in all aspects 
 Of organized crime. And if there's one thing I'm sure of 
 It's that drugs destroy your mind and destroy your home 
 In the end it'll only lead our country into ruin 
 We eat fish, toss salads and make rap ballads 
 The biochemical slanglord'll throw the Arabs 
 In the dope fiend, vocal chords switch laser beams 
 My triple sevens broke the slot machines out in Queens 
 Grey Poupon is Revlon rap, smack pawns, swing like batons 
 Most my niggas smoke like Hillshire Farms 
 Check the gummy sole, underneath my shoe lies the tap 
 That attract bow-legged bitches with wide horse gaps 
 In steel mills Iron he'll smoke the blow on duns 
 You run errands, Primatene Mist is afraid of my lungs 
 Turn my channel, it'll blow your whole bench off the panel 
 Like eighty roman candles that backfired then slammed you 
 Every day is like a video shoot, check this shit 
 I take it back to Playboy, stash guns in whips 
 Picture afro picks, shish kabobs and dashikis 
 Thousands civil marched, raised their fists in early sixties 
 Now check this one, you must have been stupid to miss this one 
 Donna shogun-ing flip a ton of fashion 
 Destination be the cash one, I step past one 
 Don't make me blast one, I'm cold like eskimo flow 
 Cappa villain stay chillin' take shots of penicillin 
 Clean out and let the steam out, she fiend to blow out 
 But I'm equipped with mad white, Morris The Rap got nine lives 
 I'll take a few hundred thousand dollar dives 
 And then I still never go down 
 Until the last round I shine 
 When RZA do his thing motherfucker, I'mma do mine 
 Now, where I come from cats be carrying, marrying drug money 
 Fuck up your wife, get four to life 
 Cream we handling, Midtown niggas scrambling 
 Move and examine the fly shit, plus quick to buy shit 
 Chef, yeah, you know the whole gods astral 
 Fidel Castro suits plus depositing cash rule 
 Big time, play it like Canadian wine 
 RZA's divine now, the sacredness of one's true mind 
 Now let's get colorful like money green 
 High roller coaster, Sosa, million dollar nigger roaster 
 Yeah God, be having my whole steez laced 
 Now let's rap a taste, connect dots, aim Glocks, train stop 
 Figaro fly jewelin', tri-color Cubans 
 Swerving we'll pow with Germans in Suburbans 
 Twenty-four niggas with vests on, my own restaurant 
 Dons sending my sons membership forms 
 And still getting this paper scraper 
 Fake gators from Jamaica, wizards be passing like Lakers 
 And it be coming from Lex Louis Rich Liberace 
 Fetus style and blocking goals like hockey
