 Verse One: Raekwon the Chef 
 Stand on the block Reebok gun cocked 
 Avalance rock get paid off mass murderous services 
 Chef break em, watch the alley cats bake em 
 Watch the alley cats bake em 
 Four-nine made em, Jah create 'em take em 
 Quick fast we reflect like the sky be blue true 
 Wu-Tang saga continue 
 Rap Myer Lansky, crash ya fantasy 
 Get high fellas, stand by, 'here's the plan, see?' 
 Sit back collectin' Tecs N checks and 
 Blowin' slow in a Montaro flexin 
 Beats break heavily word to INS bless me 
 Blow me like three bags of cess 
 For real from the Killa Hill locked and caged in 
 We're swarm representatives, reactin like paid men 
 Strive for why's, nine lives in lies 
 Max sell and enjoy the highs -- what 
 Chorus/Break: 
 [Raekwon the Chef] The treasure is the glaciers of ice 
 [Ghostface] Orginal man 
 [Raekwon/Ghost] Posess the power to hold G's guns and grams 
 [Ghostface] Caker baker 
 [Raekwon the Chef] Pull off a keystone caper 
 Point out the baddest bitch in the crowd 
 [Raekwon/Ghost] And I'm a scrape her 
 Verse Two: Master Killer 
 Proceed with caution as you enter the symphony 
 Degrees of pulse will increase intensely 
 Syndrome was caused by the deadly drums 
 But the battle was won by swords being swung 
 Slicing with a vocal 
 From the international vocalist 
 Ya style is too local 
 To fuck with this 
 All fits of antagonists 
 No assistance movin motionless 
 Mysterious swiftness 
 Thoughts roll down the shaft of the brain 
 Mental gives the signal to the physical 
 Whirlwind kicks and hits from every angle 
 Violent temperments 
 Uncountenance dented 
 Poison vintage wine rhymes I invented 
 Chumped by the drunken punches that punches the heart 
 Vital sparks from the arteries start 
 Verse Three: Ghostface Killer 
 The treasure is the glaciers of ice original man 
 Posess the power of hold G's guns and grams 
 Straight up and down it's all good 
 Peace to them check castin chain snatchin gun flashin 
 Niggaz in the hood bubblin good 
 Analyze stocks, we'll be buyin lion heads and cloths 
 To all my house bitches, Starks will be home soon 
 I'm on tour chill, catch you Ninety-Six in June 
 But until then my ten-man team be safe 
 Chill on the whips to settle this, we can all get laced 
 Take a boat cruise, sip daquiris and max swimmin pools 
 Fly jewels Wally shoes blow stacks relax kid 
 Black kids got a cravin for grapes until we get back 
 I'm packed leave the Mac that you're with 
 But whatever, I gotta hit other sides of the Earth 
 Spread Wu-ness, foolish, civilization's cursed 
 But luckily I'm born to be wild and aure-al 
 Move crowds collect twenty thou and then we out 
 Heavy convoys my crew keep pretty boys paranoid 
 Blow like a steroid pat Dan's they're Akyroid 
 My seeds growin' his seeds marry his seeds 
 That's how we keep Wu-Tang money all up in the family 
 Chorus [all done by Ghostface] 
 Outro: Ghostface 
 My seeds growin' his seeds marry his seeds 
 That's how we keep Wu-Tang money all up in the family 
 {It's been a long time... 
 Since Wu-Tang family came to shine...}
