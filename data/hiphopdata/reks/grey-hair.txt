I wanted to rock them three stripes, Timbs, and Nikes 
 Momma told me when I'm older I'll experience life 
 But now it's all grey hairs 
 It's all grey hairs 
 It's all grey hairs 
 It's all grey 
 (Verse One) 
 I pop bottles and read the good book 
 Skipped college, man 
 Watched Top Models 
 Cause soon they'll be hollering 
 We made travels like Gulliver 
 Used to be kings like Solomon 
 Then became slaves like Tubman and then 
 Government wanna us see us running like Harriet 
 To avoid the establishment 
 Of prison cell blocks 
 Little shorties come out of the womb, ready to sell rocks 
 Rock charms, Jesus Christ pendant covered in ice 
 I guess my only advice 
 Is watch, jewels, gems, come with a price 
 It's such an identity crisis 
 How we can cop new bank gear 
 Not care what the price is 
 Jesus hang from a cross and now he hang from your neck 
 Still no respect, don't know who Christ is 
 We are living in times of the most critical kind 
 Grey hairs got visible lines 
 I wanted to rock them three stripes, Timbs, and Nikes 
 Momma told me when I'm older I'll experience life 
 But now it's all grey hairs 
 It's all grey hairs 
 It's all grey hairs 
 It's all grey 
 (Verse Two) 
 Can you sense it that hopes is missing 
 That the focus isn't there any longer children 
 Being raised by a new age 
 Given a new craze 
 They listen, to the beat and nod 
 Disregard thoughts written 
 They walking dead around us pimping 
 And our mission is no longer to reach within 'em 
 Our mission should be now to decrease the tension 
 But instead we just give in to nature 
 Label haters 
 'Cause we don't let the radios make us different 
 Getting grey hairs from all of that anger building 
 I'd be lying if I said I ain't aging and sensing 
 A bit of change in my ageless wisdom 
 What are we to do now 
 For the patient victims 
 Who just wish music would return to its senses 
 That we at some point would respect our mission 
 And give back to rap, the greatest invention 
 I wanted to rock them three stripes, Timbs, and Nikes 
 Momma told me when I'm older I'll experience life 
 But now it's all grey hairs 
 It's all grey hairs 
 It's all grey hairs 
 It's all grey 
 (Verse Three) 
 Hip-hop influences raised me 
 Say, for instance, Jay-Z said the +Streets Is Watching+ 
 So I kept on driving, head bobbin' crazy 
 Older couple in the next car upset 
 They couldn't make me 
 Turn the volume down, my volume up 
 And I'm a ride 'round town 
 Blast that volume, WHAT?! 
 But these days, these kids really don't give fuck 
 Listening to Dip Set, now they sticking you up 
 Take every rhyme literal, YEP! 
 They more criminal, PLUS 
 It's more reality to kill for a buck 
 But how can I judge? 
 When it's a part of the beautiful music I love 
 They iPods full of G-Unit, the best thug 
 Next up, everybody in the cipher rhymin' 
 Out to Get Rich and Die Trying 
 Dark clouds keep us out of the grey 
 The sun rising, looking better today 
 So I say...
