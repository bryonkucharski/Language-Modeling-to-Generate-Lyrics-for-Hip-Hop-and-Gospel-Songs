Ayo I never banged, and through it all, never changed my name 
 They used to call me Young Blu, before the fame 
 Like my cousin Smurf, heard about a OG who used to run that turf 
 Then he got murked 
 Puttin' in work with the Blacks when the Browns was beefin' 
 I got my griefin' after school with the chicks grievin' 
 Like Blu, thank God that wasn't you, ayo 
 One week later, they got my homeboy too, ayo 
 Dang, my cousin used to tell me, "Boy watch for them colors." 
 Other than that, you be the illest mothafucka" 
 So I pushed to the streets, I pushed to the beach 
 End up pushin' more raps than I ever pushed trees 
 I had beats from the best 
 Just to make it known, I was a beast from the West 
 Tryna get put on with the Snoops and the Games 
 The Cubes and the Pacs 
 Next thing you know they bangin' Blu on the block 
 My nigga, bang! 
 When the times get hard in the streets, niggas bang 
 When them right bars sit up on the beat, niggas bang 
 When niggas sling cocaine all day to make change 
 Niggas bang, niggas bang, niggas bang-bang 
 Tryna tell ahk, "Watch where you walk", niggas bang 
 When that spark set fire to that heart, niggas bang 
 From the rollers to the lames, ain't a damn thing change 
 My niggas bang, niggas bang, bang-bang 
 Now I'm back up on the block, rap shit locked 
 Pocket full of money, no crack in my socks 
 Shouts to the homies in jail with no bail 
 And props to the homies that blow but don't sell 
 They be like "Oh well, more room for the real" 
 Popped a fake in the face for actin' like I can't tell 
 Yeah it feels all good in the hood, I know it ain't 
 Should be smellin' all good, but, I know it stank 
 Tell the homie hold the shape while I blow that dank 
 Roll the streets with that cannon like we rollin' tanks 
 Unh, gold plates ho, I know they gon' hate 
 Might as well get the gold plaques, and the platinum chains 
 See me when you see me, 'til then, kiss the genie 
 Spell G, me, you could never be me, believe me 
 Put your CD on smoke, fuck PDs and the hoes 
 And them niggs talkin' 'bout their shit bang when it don't 
 My nigga, bang 
 No stranger to the game, but you can't seem to relieve her 
 You'll see her, when the morning comes 
 When the times get hard in the streets, niggas bang 
 When them right bars sit up on the beat, niggas bang 
 When niggas sling cocaine all day to make change 
 Niggas bang, niggas bang, niggas bang-bang 
 Tryna tell ahk, "Watch where you walk", niggas bang 
 When that spark set fire to that heart, niggas bang 
 From the rollers to the lames, ain't a damn thing change 
 My niggas bang, niggas bang, bang-bang 
 Ayo, next thing you know, I'm in that county 
 With a whole bunch of real OG's surroundin' me 
 What you do when your name's Blu 
 And you run into a Crip, a Cholo, a Piru? 
 And everybody wanna know on the coast, what set you claim 
 All my life I had that name, but never banged 
 I'm from the Bridge, my folk from the 4th 
 East side to the dro, and all the way back home, let it be known 
 I got love for my block, love for my color 
 Love for my streets, and love for my brother 
 But a nigga put his hands on me, we catch fades 
 Fuck I look like? 30, gettin' jumped in a gang 
 And my peeps say, "How you keep peace these days 
 If you ain't got a piece by your reach these days?" 
 I say, my nigga, when you victim to the system 
 It don't matter what you do, they always fuckin' with you 
 So just bang 
 No stranger to the game, but you can't seem to relieve her 
 You'll see her, when the morning comes
