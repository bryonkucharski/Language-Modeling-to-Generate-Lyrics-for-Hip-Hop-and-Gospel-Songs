Yeah 
 See if you can relate to this one 
 Hope I'm not disturbing you 
 Because you look into thought right now 
 I don't mean to be rude 
 'Cause this is normally not my style 
 Can I take you out 
 I feel that if I don't ask chance will pass 
 And I'll never see your face again, 
 I'll never see your face again. No 
 You maybe thinking I am strange 
 Not every single day, no, beauty comes my way, so 
 Do you believe in love at first sight 
 Tell me does that book that your reading 
 Tell the story of your life 
 Do you believe in love at first sight 
 Should I walk on by, turn a blind eye 
 To love, love at first sight. 
 I could be the man for you 
 I can make all your dreams come true 
 Maybe I'm a fool 
 For saying I'm in love with you 
 You may be thinking I am strange not every single day, no 
 Beauty comes my way 
 Oh 
 DO you believe in love at first sight 
 Tell me does that book that you're reading 
 Tell the story of your life 
 Do you believe in love at first sight 
 Should I walk on by, turn a blind eye 
 To love, love at first sight. 
 You Say farewell 
 I'll say so long 
 Say goodbye 
 I'll say your wrong 
 Cause here in my arms you belong 
 Woo 
 Oh 
 Do you believe in love at first sight 
 Tell me does that book that you're reading 
 Tells the story of your life 
 Do you believe in love at first sight 
 Should I walk on by, turn a blind eye 
 To love, love at first sight. 
 Do you believe in love at first sight 
 Tell me does that book that you're reading 
 Tells the story of your life 
 Do you believe in love at first sight 
 Should I walk on by, turn a blind eye 
 To love, love at first sight. 
 To love, love at first sight.
