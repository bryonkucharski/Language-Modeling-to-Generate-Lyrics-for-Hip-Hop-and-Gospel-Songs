I got my cross-trainers on, motherfucker, I run shit 
 All I do is rap, make dough for the dumb shit 
 The return of that 808 trunk hit 
 Cash in my palm, I'mma pass the baton, GO! 
 Cross trainers on my motherfuckin' feet (go!) 
 Cross trainers on my motherfuckin' feet (go!) 
 Cross trainers on my motherfuckin' feet 
 Cash in my palm, I'mma pass the baton 
 You be on that fuck shit, I'm tryin' to make bucks quick 
 Don't talk to me if money ain't the subject 
 93's laced up, we about to run shit 
 Mibbs right beside me, BeYoung got the blunt lit 
 Shawn on the cut, Swiff D on the drum kits 
 Standin' on your table with a bottle and a drunk bitch 
 Fallin' all over spillin' drinks, tryin' to tongue kiss 
 Money over hoes, so you know I ain't the one, Miss 
 Take her home, make her moan, and when I get done: (Switch!) 
 Pass her off like a basketball 
 Stay with dimes, I'm like Nash to y'all 
 My living room look like a casting call 
 Don't be bringing hoes where (?) are 
 A sweet talkin' nigga, ask your mom 
 My nigga, that's your squad? 
 We treat line-ups like that's Lebron 
 Push backwards like the bush whackers 
 We ain't just kush rappers - we max it out like Foot Action 
 Nigga hand over fist, bring some cash in this bitch 
 Y'all niggas picture near puttin' swag in your spliffs 
 My niggas cop the 7 just to laugh at the 6 
 Like "nigga, do you know how much ass I'mma get?" 
 Wrote a plan out, let's dip, we can market and sing 
 Put that cash in a stash, save that part for the rent 
 Only way niggas swingin' is to target the fence 
 That's why everything we're singing hit the target like Prince, man 
 I'm talkin' vanity and "Can it be?"'s 
 Stickin' to the strategy, how simple can it be? 
 Niggas comin' home we gon' put them on the salary 
 Niggas think they cold till we push our shit to Calgary 
 Yeah, you're who-blah and your shoe rot 
 You're too shy to be Rah Rah, your due ska 
 You're new job from Calgary to the new spot 
 Threw that 2pac on, but couldn't ride like we used 'ta 
 Used up, you're new guy's shoe size 
 Drew ties, never move pies move lines 
 She do lines why we shoot rhymes, shoo fly 
 Don't bother the father, just let me do mine 
 It's notorious, peep it 
 Y'all niggas is Victoria's Secret 
 Soft as Mom's lingerie 
 It's a man's world boy, put the pom-poms away 
 It's only right we got our palms on LA 
 'Cause if Pac was alive, you'd get bombed on today 
 Bombs bombs away, like 'Bron 'Bron and Wade 
 We been had next, now it's our time to play, nigga 
 Your false prophets will never jump in my pockets 
 You're poppin' your gums and I'm poppin' your optics 
 Optimus Prime when I'm done 
 And the topic of music is me 
 And the logic is usually 
 You should stop in and grab a degree 
 In the science of how to emcee 
 And I'm watchin' the critic critique 
 When I'm climbing the valleys and peaks 
 And aligning myself 
 While I'm riding Orion's belt 
 In the street and defiling this beat 
 As a dead bitch that lay at my feet 
 This is King shit
