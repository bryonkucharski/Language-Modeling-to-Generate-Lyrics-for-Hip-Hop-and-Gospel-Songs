Ayo relax soul, and rap dope 
 Surpassed hope I was young, survived life 
 Lightskin ridin' with Co$$, making runs making funds 
 Snatch you off the mic if you wasn't nice 
 This is rap, I script the ridiculous 
 You could kiss me once, reciting Biggie get that nigga hung 
 Cuban links cost too much, I broke a brick 
 Fuck you think slum, 83' N.W.A. TJ Beast 
 My rap like, bring a nigga back like AZ 
 Life is a bitch that never raised me 
 I'm from the 80's you could picture me crazy 
 Kinda gravy with that wavy flow 
 I need that Caddy or Mercedes so your lady know 
 That I'm from cali y'all 
 Page me after 8 and we'll be straight 
 Bombay on the breaks and it's a day 
 Rap Dope 
 It's like, yeah 
 She shined all the time 
 Put the Piru on my mind 
 Pardon me, for my love I'm doing fine 
 I'm sure you looking good, pushing good 
 Wassup with that, watchu' talking? 
 You knew I would, what the deal witchu' doll? 
 I see you lookin' all delectable, it's quite huxtable 
 Of you to get involved 
 No more pushing the button when the stick up kid is buttoned up in that button up 
 Hope I ain't stuck up 
 Pardon my mouth but I don't wanna sock my watch in your mouth 
 I grew up with the fuzz huggin my [?] 
 [?] Autobot, Robocop, doughnuts, ice cream trucks, Parliament thump 
 Fresh Prince with the comic, one pant leg doing the LL 
 It never failed, running hoes in my penny 
 Smashing left over, stolen from Denny's, rolling from fifties 
 Folding up 50's, posing with the whole shit, sewn up with me 
 On the low for the city though 
 Rap Dope 
 Straight up 
 Destined to do it 
 Blessing the presents with the presence 
 A steadier message, who is you foolin'? 
 Calvin Coolin' with that Doolittle soundtrack 
 I rep the squad, Def Jam CDs in my napsack 
 Raekwon, Pooh Bear, leaning on my low life 
 No life is no joke, the microphone fiends on the mic 
 Saw Willams was silly, I never met him, a pity really 
 Even still though, I honor the professor, none the lesser 
 I play the movie, not the director, it's never better 
 Some niggas need to keep they shit together like you pee MD 
 [?] Is etc, the plethora, miles ahead of ya 
 I tell 'em smile forever but you'll never last 
 I shot the best dressed in class 'cause he made me wear the best I had 
 I'm never mad though, relax soul, back roll 
 The teacher asked how I get that much cash flow 
 Rap Dope, nigga
