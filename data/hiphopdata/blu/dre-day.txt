World Class 
 Since Wreckin' Cru 
 Cause my resume say "Wreckin' Crews" 
 Cut all my records like the best to do it 
 Destined to 
 Dress for the music so I could step to it 
 Ya, no one does it better as I step to her 
 Lex Lugers through your smoke and mirrors I appear miraculous 
 Emotions clear, my devotion matters 
 I clap rappers like awards-show writers 
 What's the doors of your Viper to the thoughts of a Christler 
 Opportunity knocks on the window of my Limo and offendin' 
 Trying to give advice how I could get on 
 Nigga, you couldn't picture the soundscapes I spit on 
 I'll do it for you 
 Aluminum foil for sitcoms 
 Have rap wrapped like Reynolds 
 For rentals and continentals 
 On Centinela posted like a Sentinel with seven yellers 
 Kiss Ladera on my way to work 
 Skip church 
 Twisted up the earth in a new shirt 
 Ya, Dre day 
 Dre day 
 Dre day 
 Uh, and did I mention chronic? 
 Was sick, went through Bubonics 
 If you through with knowledge 
 No comment 
 The Lakers beat the Supersonics 
 Straight Ebonics 
 If you want to call it alcoholic 
 Found my wallet 
 Next thing you know I'm found on Slauson 
 Talking all them prices down before I take a shot of Sunset 
 We couldn't crush, we wasn't one yet 
 If the ones wasn't huggin' my block, cuffin' my knots 
 I could pull out my charriot, stop and just ride 
 Uh, for all the bitches and the hoes and tricks 
 Ya, we brought it back so you don't forget 
 Dre day 
 Uh, Dre day
