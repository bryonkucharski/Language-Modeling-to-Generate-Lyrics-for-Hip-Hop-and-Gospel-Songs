88 carats on my gold face, shining like the golden state 
 Ridin' all day and shit, banging for my whole race 
 All black, no blanks 
 Spacings on my ball cap, playin' like we all stacked 
 Aces, new money all black faces 
 Tell them bummy niggas fall back 
 Bases, play never broke, we gon forever blow 
 Blue weed, blue money, Blu do it better for 
 Hoes on my level know I shine like a bezzle bro, bro 
 Treasure will forever glow 
 Them specials be especially special to 
 She knew it, she tried to hold me back but she blew it 
 My partner bought an old school Buick and let me cruise it 
 Was sittin' in the liquor store wonderin what the fuck was I doin' 
 And thank God it was music nigga, then I'm home 
 Gonna take a miracle 
 Cause by now I know I need you so 
 Hope that you can catch me when I fall 
 I know that you can catch me 
 Catch me when I fall 
 Good golly, hood got me got me started on that [?] 
 Bliddy in the memory from last night, dizzy yo 
 80 shots of Henny, took an eight of my memory on my cellphone 
 Telling this chick, she could forget me 
 I was so stoned, taking this ho home, no phone 
 Hand signalling niggas, like I don't roam 
 Playing that postpone on 'em for the fifth 
 Niggas played Soul Provider 60 times in the whip 
 I'm like homes ain't never sold dope, He ain't never seen crack 
 He ain't never had to tote, what he think that he G for? 
 Them niggas need PO's to be dope, please folk 
 Ya got the game crushed you need dough 
 Live from the 53-0, from out the weed smoke and henny we pour 
 I emerge for all my people who ain't never seen the world like me 
 Still ain't forgot where I'm from, but now we back like the Prodigal son, I'm home 
 Gonna take a miracle 
 Cause by now I know I need you so 
 Hope that you can catch me when I fall 
 I know that you can catch me 
 Catch me when I fall 
 I stay paid every first of the month 
 Dropping 100 on them meals for the times we couldn't pay for a lunch 
 We live the life niggas couldn't live once, twisting up, getting drunk 
 Pushing the young, pushing my lungs to the fullest extent 
 With the goodest intent, till the hood is content 
 I only put it on the hood 'cause I'm bent 
 She came out the bar pushing a bent, I came out the bar pushing a pent 
 But go together like pepper and mint, Christian but she never made it to lent 
 My money made a denim, still I never knew what made lint, it make sense right? 
 Now make dollars till you get your shit polished like a new whip 
 Models on the tip like [?] on the fence or impalas on the strip 
 Had the keys to the city since a kid my nig, I'm home 
 Gonna take a miracle 
 Cause by now I know I need you so 
 Hope that you can catch me when I fall 
 I know that you can catch me 
 Catch me when I fall
