One minute loving life now all we do is fuss and fight 
 You fucking right I'm fucking pissed, I'm fucking right 
 You fucking his right? You fucking right? 
 Next thing you know she gone, that's how you know she wrong 
 Months ago she wouldn't sleep alone 
 Now she don't even speak on phones 
 To me it means that she's in peace, but uh to each is own 
 Treat her like meat and bones, kisses and reads her poems 
 Looking to clean her loans, why you clinging on? 
 Used to think that home is where heartbeat is 
 It's never where the artist is 
 So she teases, teaches the old dog new tricks 
 Kathie Lee and Regis Co-sign a new whip 
 Happy just to be with Classy as a drink 
 Ink pen separation, been a minute since 
 I kicked some new shit Pink lips to patience?
