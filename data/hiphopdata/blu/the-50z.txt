Uh 
 The light-skin with the nice trim 
 400 spokes riding the stroll by the white folks 
 The rare bones get the bare Jones 
 If it's the caddy, it's gotta be Weston, when he head home 
 Young Burgundy with the purple leaf 
 Purposely serve the streets 
 Murk the beat, when the verse complete 
 Turkish leaves, when I work for cheap 
 Burn my AC up, foreign chick, forgot who Jay Z was 
 Ladies love 'em like he cool James 
 Big body, when I role through the hood, I use 2 lanes 
 Showed her a few things, before we do things 
 Cause there's is rules to the games, with Blu Haines 
 Yup, shoe string for the victims 
 The 50z, The 50z, The 50z, The 50z, The 50z, The 50z crush! 
 Uh the high yella, with the acapella 
 She say it ain't about the cheese 
 It's the way we chop the mozzarella 
 Old school with the gold juice, the gold tooth 
 I never had the rope, and the bowl shoes 
 No love for the home of thugs 
 Cause it ain't a what she do 
 It's the shit you tell her don't do 
 Be L, get the females 
 The models just to nosel [?] 
 They call me lucky like a silver dollar 
 Silver collar poppin', till I'm pealing piles with my partners 
 The veals hopping 
 Young Slausen, with the chill flossing 
 What are soldiers be bossin' 
 'Cause we don't listen to the drill sergeants 
 Marching through the 50z 
 The 50z, The 50z, The 50z, The 50z, The 50z, The 50z crush! 
 Yup, the Philly cap with the Philly rap 
 Blow the biddy, through the diddy, through the city till they give me that 
 Young royal, got the ones for you 
 At the titty bar, trying to make stars out these silly broads 
 Lexus' for exes, the Escalades for escapades 
 L.A. is the set we aim 
 I got the pass from the Mexicans 
 Just so I could flag through the Aves, for them green bag blesses 
 You could see the whole city from the hilltops 
 Take 'em down to the coast to get your wheels washed 
 And we still bang parliament 
 Hit the store by the park, when I'm parched for them parliaments 
 Park the bands off Arlington 
 Spark the flint, right before I told her what part we in 
 Pardon me, we in the 
 The 50z, The 50z, The 50z, The 50z, The 50z, The 50z crush!
