Hi Nanni, it's your granddaughter Riani 
 I love you and I miss you 
 Hi Nanni, this is your granddaughter Shadaria 
 Love you and I miss you, see when I get there 
 Hi Mom this is your daughter Teela 
 I love you and I miss you 
 God bless you 
 I hope the scribe finds ya soul, good Mom I love you 
 Miss you, and I know I speak for the whole hood 
 Ain't nothin' changed still shed tears 
 I can believe I've been mournin' your death 
 Goin' on close to six years 
 I think about that heavenly day 
 As I meditate in section fifty three row seventy eight 
 I'm obsessed to see you but I know it's a process 
 So until then miss, God bless 
 Seems just like yesterday when I saw ya hope 
 I made it crystal clear how I truly adore ya 
 I couldn't help it the other day I broke down 
 To my lawyer WGY, I tattooed my right arm for ya 
 He could understand all the time that was given 
 He couldn't understand the pain his mother's still livin' 
 He couldn't understand all the love that you gave to thee 
 Sacrifices that you made for me while I'm singin' 
 Mama, your love lives inside of us 
 And we'll be livin' inside your love 
 And I know you forever 
 Will be watchin' from heaven above 
 Some times it gets rough for us 
 Livin' without you here 
 But I know we'll together again 
 Livin' inside of your love, yeah, yeah 
 I remember all throughout the mall we used to walk about 
 The house down in Maryland that you used to talk about 
 One day I'ma make in mind my only object 
 To give you a better life and take you out of the project 
 Because you deserve better than pissy elevators 
 Stray shots from haters and roaches by the insinuators 
 Those nosy neighbors made you wanna run away 
 Main reason why I could never put my gun away 
 Still could see the pain as soon as you busted in crushed within 
 Found out your baby boy was hustlin' 
 I still quiver as the doctor delivered news that made me shiver 
 Said the cancer spread through ya liver 
 The next day I cried hopin' but I knew you was leavin' 
 When I saw you with your eyes open but wasn't breathin' 
 Could you imagine takin' your mother's hand 
 In a body that's colder than any winter ever known to man? 
 Mama your love lives inside of us 
 And we'll be livin' inside your love 
 And I know you forever 
 Will be watchin' from heaven above 
 Some times it gets rough for us 
 Livin' without you here 
 But I know we'll together again 
 Livin' inside of your love, yeah, yeah 
 I draw strength from her death, go to live for her breath 
 When I'm wrong drop to my knees and repent till I'm fresh 
 September Sixth music represent to my best 
 Stay focused and play the hesitant to the left 
 Conversations with God, now it's not quite the stress 
 Gave me the reassurance that my life was blessed 
 Because I've been in the tight spot 
 That's with enough pain for ten Annie's 
 That's why I write hot and win Grammies 
 Courageous enough to throw my chest to a block 
 Fortunate enough to throw a Lex to my pops 
 I got so much love I can rest on my block 
 Break day and fall asleep on the bench with my watch 
 Player hated eternally but I can't be stopped 
 God, Moms and me gotta reach the top 
 Conceal my staff, cowards wanna squeal, I laugh 
 You will never know how real till you feel my wrath 
 Feel my wrath, feel my wrath 
 Mama your love lives inside of us 
 And we'll be livin' inside your love 
 And I know you forever 
 Will be watchin' from heaven above 
 Some times it gets rough for us 
 Livin' without you here 
 But I know we'll together again 
 Livin' inside of your love, yeah, yeah 
 Mama your love lives inside of us 
 And we'll be livin' inside your love 
 And I know you forever 
 Will be watchin' from heaven above 
 Some times it gets rough for us 
 Livin' without you here 
 But I know we'll together again 
 Livin' inside of your love, yeah, yeah 
 Yo hold on, hold on, let's take a minute to reflect 
 On the whole thing you know I'm goin' on six years 
 Without my moms and that's a livin' hell 
 You know that's a part of ya life that you'll never get back 
 You know when she died, a part of me died 
 You know that's a pain that nobody needs to go through 
 Yo we all gotta do it but while she's still here 
 Appreciate your mother and love your mother, ya heard me 
 I need y'all to feel me on this one, yo I'm out, one love
