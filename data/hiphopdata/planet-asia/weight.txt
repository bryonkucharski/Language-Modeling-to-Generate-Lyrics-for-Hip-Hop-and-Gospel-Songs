Life... 
 Uh... 
 And it don't stop... yeah 
 What's up world? 
 Dealin' wit deep shit 
 Inside, I can't hide 
 It's what I sleep with 
 I took it upon myself to show my other side 
 I send this record to the youth 
 Victimized to abuse 
 Can't understand it more than those cats whose 
 -Unwise decisions causes war 
 Internal, external 
 I broadcast this journal 
 -For all who walk around deceased 
 We breathe the air yet in the mind still we can't find peace 
 There's never peace, it's always war 
 Feelin' sorry for what?! 
 Presidents and politics before the planet destructs 
 All mapped out, 
 Sketched out 
 -Written in Revelation 
 To the final destination 
 Heaven on earth is just a mental speculation 
 His death could be the message of the whole tropical 
 His life was so powerful 
 Nothing on earth is more valuable 
 -Than what you become 
 So get your thinking out the box before you're restin in one 
 And be free 
 -No matter the case 
 Or on the contrary, 
 My vision's a diary 
 No one but God can take it from me 
 So even if I'm on the 'undee' 
 -Makin' bad decisions 
 At least I' got a chance to make a transition 
 -From USA 
 Manipulators of the world we know today 
 It's all bad, but lemme tell you what you wanna know 
 Yo... y'all need to wake up 
 I got weight on ma shoulders that I gotta push 
 I feel the hatin' it done affected a lot of us 
 It's all bad, and I' even been the one there before 
 But yo 
 Lemme tell you what you wanna know [x2] 
 Ma grandmother always told me, 
 "Jason, beware of your surroundings 
 ...Your friends you're counting on 
 -Could also be your drowning." 
 She said, life is journey N we all on ships 
 So get your ownerships 
 -Before you end up under the ocean of wasted talent 
 Where the could-have, should-have people sit and mope 
 My ambition reflects success; to my old folks 
 -Just keep ya head up 
 It's got to get better 
 -Because it's written 
 I know sometimes it seems the negativity won't let up 
 With the natural disasters and plagues 
 Prostitution and AIDS 
 Guns, grenades 
 -Man made 
 These are the last days' norm 
 Starving children have no homes 
 While the entertainers watch 
 With all the millions being made, it should be owned 
 That's why I emcee only to open 
 Though this paganism 
 I blame it on the system 
 'Cause it's more than racism 
 Watching movies like the matrix 
 -It's only plain and simple why we livin' in 
 -A world of illusions where everybody praises dividends 
 But yo...(yo... yo... yo..) 
 Lemme tell you what you wanna know 
 I got ma mind focused 
 No more blind conversations, 
 For real 
 Let's build 
 They' building missiles 
 -To kill nations 
 Smiley faces 
 Quiet maces 
 Settin up plans for so-called aliens flyin in space-ships 
 Like while the upper force is tampered 
 As been my ancestors 
 Separated through the filth 
 -So just to only be strong 
 Before we get there, it won't be long 
 Striving for better days 
 -Placed to fuel for every hit song 
 As long as I strive 
 While I'm alive 
 I'll find my salvation 
 For conquering 
 All goals set to the side, 
 To raise a consciousness 
 With one cause and that's 
 -To be right 
 Like, towards the east the sky is blue 
 -And God's the color of night 
 So it ain't no need for war 
 -'Cause it was once one land 
 -When it began 
 So recognize the planet's headin for destruction 
 But yo... 
 Lemme tell you what you wanna know 
 Yo... 
 Black people... 
 Knowledge, wisdom, understanding... 
 Man, woman N child... 
 Food, clothin N shelter... 
 And it don't stop... 
 Yo... Lemme tell you what you wanna know.
