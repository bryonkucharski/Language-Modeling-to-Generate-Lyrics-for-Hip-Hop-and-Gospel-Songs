Since the first episode you didn't think that it would last 
 But this term it's Cali Agents for your sucka ass 
 Heirlooms to bust the ass I transform from mental ?depray? 
 You got a beeper but still you comin' up wit' lint 
 So I starts my mission 
 Leaves my residence wit' secret evidence of the United States' past president 
 We all a family so therefore we must fight because 
 We from the same blood, the Most High comin' back to claim us 
 Subconsciously, I crush my calm digi-tal-ly 
 Lyri-cal-ly wit' the shill of Israel over my physi-cal-ly 
 My ???? plot wit' seven virtues of mind 
 I lift off, like Mr. Spock cause the surface can get your shots 
 ????? I missed the spot, I bless hip hop, connect my dots 
 Plus make you respect my block, I bust off, like, hot pistols 
 Yo, Ras, what happened to them cats that said we was trash, 
 And said the road that we was taking to success wouldn't last? 
 Yo, no where to be found, these clowns 
 They bitch made, I'm the switchblade 
 Talkin' that shit, you get split 
 We double headed, never forget it, the non-dreaded 
 Let's spread it on the ground, minus the head and crown 
 First round, ridiculous sound gettin' down 
 Comin' to ya spot, runnin' you outta the town 
 Profound tag team, shatterin' hopes and dreams 
 Be on your insides, ready to rip the seams 
 Straight from the stich, some brothers can act bitch 
 Broke ass niggas pretendin' to be rich 
 Can't rhyme a damn lick, but still be on the mic 
 They don't want the beef, but still we gotta strike 
 So put the track on, I'm rippin' the Bat ???? 
 And call up your friends, I'll bring you the Bat Phone 
 Ain't no team better than As' and Rasco 
 We blood brothers here to enhance the cash flow, yo 
 What they goin' do when we blaze they spot? 
 Lookin' around for different ways they can stop 
 No gimmicky shit, it's just straight hip hop 
 We Blood Brothaz, takin' care of one another 
 Rasco and Planet Asia, ain't no breaking this bomb 
 We Blood Brothers till the finish wit' the faith in our palms 
 So anything that comes between me and this cat gettin' dough 
 It's life or death, fuck around and have yo' back on the flo' 
 You know the convo', and every since we Took It Back Home 
 We kept the trademark, leavin' emcees bookin' back home 
 Cali Agents took the bullets like this, there is no other 
 And that's all I got to say for see-A, we Blood Brothaz 
 Now wait a minute, let me put my ten cents in it 
 When you see Ras you better scream out lieutenant 
 Or captain, niggas be over reactin' 
 But we just ignore, go from shore to shore 
 When niggas test you, they got to test me, too 
 When God blessed you, he musta blessed me, too 
 We one in the same and ain't a damn thing changed 
 Stay outta the range before we bring y'all the pain 
 The ball and the chain that don't apply, that's why 
 You got stuck and got hung out to dry 
 Tried to be shy, but that shit don't fly 
 Sparkin' the jam like it's the Fourth of July 
 See, we got plans to travel throughout the land 
 Make plenty of grands while y'all sittin' in the stands 
 Cheerin' and shit, but I just ain't hearin' the shit 
 Talkin' the trash can get you ripped from the ass 
 You know that the Ras and Planet As' spit rays 
 We holdin' it down three-hundred sixty-five days 
 A million ways to get sprayed in the fade 
 I sharpen the blades, you on the blocks for the trade 
 Permanent shade under the dirt, last spurt 
 And what you gonna do when sellin' tapes don't work? 
 Get you a job, I know it seems real odd 
 We stickin' together like two peas in a pod, now
