(Mad Child) 
 About to drill ya with a killer combo 
 King Kong, Godzilla and Rambo 
 Marker author, ain't no bitch I'm down to die for 
 Rifle in your mouth, peace to Poco on a 14 year bid 
 For jackin' mad kids, respect all my gangsta's doin' bad shit 
 An' that's it, Mad Child does nitroglycerin and acid 
 Warlock, focused on witch craft 
 You're listening to classic plastic explosives 
 Forceful courses of action, 
 Internationally we ration out portions of passion, insane 
 'Cause mental gain, like rock cocaine to brain 
 Hard to kick habit, when addict 
 Leather face, the devil spits silver saliva 
 TransCanada highway robbery, drunk getaway driver 
 This here's a bad combination 
 Like Mad Child with an AK-47, a bottle of Jack and a home invasion 
 Make you knock, laughin' as you strapped to the mattress 
 A can of gasoline, a pack of matches, for the total package 
 Bitch 
 Break out your tape recorders, make sure you document this 
 Apocalypse, infinitely adjacent, we stylin' with aquaness 
 Unorthodox, knock shit, neon crushin' ask us 
 Just advance me, rushin' up the beat, an' pass me the blunt 
 Eh yo, I'm here to set it on you cats from the moment I entered 
 Moldin' the center on it, adventure, performin' the scripture 
 A mad child prevailin' like a swollen member, so remember me 
 As obesely, intelligence with diplomatic immunity 
 A trained killer that's trained to kill ya 
 I make the fronters have bad dreams like a mad scene 
 From a hardcore thriller, throwin' fits in your sleep 
 We got heat, mission complete is when the record sound crisp in the jeep 
 Some say I think ill, and tranquilize rappers like pills 
 Ink deals and rap underground where the street feels- blast 
 But the fact is you don't know the half, 
 Closin' the caskets on your sound an' takin' over with a total package 
 Bolted and welded, I know that you felt it 
 Scrap yard, iron arms, swingin' hectic 
 Imperial metric, superior complex 
 We make seriously powerful records 
 Battleaxe vengeance, attendance grows at every show 
 Doin' songs with Planet Asia, smashin' stereos 
 Hi-fidelity, pride in my energy 
 It's 3 the hard way, queens in Bombay 
 My regional army throws explosive parties 
 We've rose in the hierarchy 
 Hose in the fire escape, world wide 
 Connected by hands that wave 
 Double edged-sharp 
 Take part and start the flow of the colour red 
 Old man Prev, an omen, a legend 
 Beats are produced by my brothers in Venice 
 10 + 2 gauge, total package of razor blades
