(Planet Asia) 
 I be handlin my business when it comes to the wax 
 Steady conjurin the concepts for the conscience in tracks 
 I'm on a worldwide mission for my shit to get heard 
 Destinies I manifest 'cause my protection is words 
 (Planet Asia) 
 Yeah ha ha, the Secret Agent, Planet Asia 
 Melodically as I come into this like 
 Universal greetings 
 To all the lost pharoahs locked behind bars 
 And tons of pressure charged for hustlin 
 I face life scarred 
 As the world turns, I let the incense burn 
 Which ables me to invent chapters till I capture a nerve 
 The way of life, for the black man, woman, and child is math 
 Due to knowledge that the brain weighs out to seven-and-a-half ounces 
 Divine actions I carry out wit persistence 
 A father ain't a father till he furthers your existence 
 Infinite, I elevate boys to build and destroy 
 Infinite, I elevate girls from fools to precious jewels 
 My Asiatic secrets, the deepest kept 
 The architect of pages intellect of the great ?imotec? amazes 
 Hip hop scholars solve equations like calculus 
 Whether MC's bring light from the supreme alphabet, it's massive 
 You ain't a king unless you governin your own aspect 
 Measures is drastic, pleasure niggas is plastic 
 Patternizing, you bitin what you writin got my analyzing 
 You vandalizing like taggin over my pieces 
 It seems your style is no different from what the beast is 
 In alien form I storm thesis, telekinesis 
 Telepathically know where the streets is 
 Without a flaw from out the jaws of the sound boy 
 Layin down the laws of virtue 
 Full circle from the vocal to the mental 
 Hip hop essentials, niggas is givin' out the wrong info 
 (Planet Asia) 
 You can't deal wit that, Planet Asia 
 Planet Asia, word 
 Handlin Business, Secret Agent back again right 
 Nuttin but classical, cuts I create 
 For international crowds compact personas wit the spoken token 
 Of the language broken into fragments unseen 
 Release energies in the records so the mental can feed 
 Off what I read off, or in between the lines I drop a seed off 
 'Bout time you figure me, I'm like a tree for you breathe off 
 Fantastically, my raps is drastically drawn 
 Strictly for, the audacity of writin platinum songs 
 Compassionate, the humble conqueror, that's known for torture shit 
 I live the laboratory wit the gift to gab, it's fortunate 
 A dysfunction to be the founder of the gesture I chose 
 To be best of what I wish for 'cause my essence was torn 
 Into the lessons I toured, to make my expressions more stable 
 Now I'm fresher than ever wit the preception that's fatal 
 The royal highness wit the final approach 
 To the throne of life 
 >From birth I took the sword out of the stone 
 Sight of Asian Knights are within me 
 I'm way beyond trendy 
 Ideas never appear 'cause my tolerance is unfriendly 
 Wit the uncivilzed listeners, caught in a trance 
 Of the glamor rappin' MC's 
 Wit these degrees advance 
 I politic stats wit knowledge of the facts of the art 
 Snatchin hip hop from the light and bringin' it back to dark 
 Wit smarts I blueprint, so I can give a fuck about your two cent 
 Of speech, because to me you're just a student to teach 
 So just support heart, 'cause inspiration causes me to work hard 
 In the School of Hard Knocks, MC's be runnin' from report cards 
 Lingering fear, every time my single appear 
 Crews run and hide 'cause I provide a tingle in the air 
 Here's a masterpiece sketched out, my brainwaves stretched out across land 
 My vocal cords will bring the music's best out 
 I write my lyrics like I'm stressed out 
 Westbound sound, Fresno Cal, test the style and get X-ed out 
 (Planet Asia) 
 Yeah yeah, like like uh 
 S-Y-P, School Yard wit the Planet A, Planet Asia 
 Planet on the track, Potto Block weed in this 
 Trend Setters, what's up? 
 What... Fresno, yeah 
 A Fresno yeah, a Fresno, 93706
