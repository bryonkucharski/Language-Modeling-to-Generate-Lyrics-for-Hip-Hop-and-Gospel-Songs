Would I be better off laid in a six foot hole 
 A body rotting eyes closed with no conscious or a soul 
 Never knowing never feeling with no memories of being 
 Only ashes laid to ashes never loving never seeing 
 Just a corpse and of course there'd be no rising of the dead 
 No apocalypse of zombies and no cracking open heads 
 With no eating of the brains because I couldn't stand the pain 
 Pitch black nothin' zerod just a head stone and a name 
 I don't know where I'm gon go but when I get there they gon know 
 I'm wicked and I run the show and I'm wicked and I'm a juggalo 
 And I'm swingin' swingin' hatchets while I'm screamin psychopathic 
 And I'm wicked and I run the show and I'm wicked and I'm a juggalo 
 Would I be better off in flames and burnin for eternity 
 And should the evil that I'm doin' really be concernin me 
 And should I bite my tongue and never seen to walk a righteous path 
 Or will I feel the devils pitchfork stickin in my righteous ass 
 Wake up to the smells off flesh slowly burnin like a pinner 
 Listen to the screams of sinners roastin like a chicken dinner 
 Everyday in hell the temperature would be a fuckin' scorcher 
 And everyday in hell a new experience in human torcher. 
 When I die I don't know where I'm gonna be but I know it's a one way ticket 
 And when I die idk where I wanna be but I know that ill stay wicked 
 I don't know where I'm gon go but when I get there they gon know 
 I'm wicked and I run the show and I'm wicked and I'm a juggalo 
 And I'm swingin' swingin' hatchets while I'm screamin psychopathic 
 And I'm wicked and I run the show and I'm wicked and I'm a juggalo 
 Would I be better off with streets of gold a halo angels wings 
 Floatin like a bodom cloud just chillin' while a choir sings 
 And every single female big ol booty sportin double ds 
 Quick to take a dick and on command be blowin' like a breeze 
 Never beein broke or feelin' sick and liquor on tap 
 Pac and biggy droppin' by to ask me 'where the weed at?' 
 Call it shangri la or heaven I just hope they listenin 
 And even though that hell is callin pray for me they let me in 
 I don't know where I'm gon go but when I get there they gon know 
 I'm wicked and I run the show and I'm wicked and I'm a juggalo 
 And I'm swingin' swingin' hatchets while I'm screamin psychopathic 
 And I'm wicked and I run the show and I'm wicked and I'm a juggalo 
 And when I die idk where I wanna be but I know that ill stay wicked 
 I don't know where I'm gon go but when I get there they gon know 
 I'm wicked and I run the show and I'm wicked and I'm a juggalo 
 And I'm swingin' swingin' hatchets while I'm screamin psychopathic 
 And I'm wicked and I run the show and I'm wicked and I'm a juggalo 
 I'm wicked
