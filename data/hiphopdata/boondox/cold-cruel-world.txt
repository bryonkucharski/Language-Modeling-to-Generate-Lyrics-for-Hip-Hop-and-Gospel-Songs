(Intro: Random people talking) 
 I don't know what to do anymore 
 After I quit with medicine I became psycotic 
 I suffer from depression 
 Complete depression 
 Had it my whole life 
 I have had it so bad that uh... 
 I had anxiety 
 Been diagnosed with major depression 
 Lots of phobias, lots of fears 
 Anxiety, panic attacks 
 Manic depression before, I didn't think that 
 Depression could be so bad 
 Sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders 
 Everything around me closing in, it's starts to grow colder 
 It's like I'm sitting on death row and waitin' for conclusion 
 Shits real fucked up, my brains filled with much confusion 
 Do you know what it is to sit a 3am 
 With a gun pressed to your temple on your knees prayin' 
 Or in the bathroom, on the floor, a handfull of pills 
 Cause the fuckin' rent's due and you can't pay bills 
 Have you ever felt the cold grip of death in your heart 
 I'm talkin' rips right in your cavity and pulls it apart 
 Ten motherfuckin' seconds just from ending this shit 
 Flames rising from the ashes that your about to commit 
 Have you ever stopped your car somewhere far from everythin' 
 Sat a half an hour, just thinkin' of a better way 
 To put your soul to rest and set your mind at ease 
 Put the barrel in my mouth, I wanna sleep for all eternity 
 Dear cold cruel world why am I here? 
 I never asked to be alive 
 Everyday it's just a struggle even to survive 
 Dear please juse wipe away the tears 
 I'll be better off when I'm gone 
 In my own private Hell and left all alone 
 Somany reasons just to leave this fuckin' planet 
 Pressure gets to me so much, god damn, I just can't stand it 
 People hatin', credit problems, bitch be fuckin' my friends 
 A million reasons, circumstances for your soul to transend 
 Nobody like me, I'm a loser, parents wish I was dead 
 I'm overweight, can't get a date, I'll turn my walls to red 
 Unlock the door, turn up the music, flip the TV screen 
 I'll leave a bloody fuckin' mess off for my moms to clean 
 It's's to the point that I can't stand it, I can't even try to cope 
 And you don't know me, you can't help me, you can't offer me no hope 
 It's too late to try and stop it, I have lost the fuckin' war 
 I ain't gonna write no fuckin' letter, leave my answers on the floor 
 I'm a do it I swear, don't even think I'm lyin' 
 Nobody gone remember me, nobody gone be cryin' 
 All alone in my death like I was in life 
 Let me take my final breath, they can bury me tonight 
 Dear cold cruel world why am I here? 
 I never asked to be alive 
 Everyday it's just a struggle even to survive 
 Dear please juse wipe away the tears 
 I'll be better off when I'm gone 
 In my own private Hell and left all alone 
 You won't miss me when I'm gone 
 (Flames risin', flames risin') 
 I know you did me so wrong 
 (Flames risin') 
 (Chorus/Outro:) 
 Dear cold cruel world why am I here? 
 Flames risin', flames risin' 
 Dear please juse wipe away the tears 
 Flames risin', flames risin' 
 Dear cold cruel world why am I here? 
 (Just wipe away, just wipe away) 
 Flames risin', flames risin' 
 Dear please juse wipe away the tears 
 (Just wipe away, just wipe away) 
 Flames risin', flames risin' 
 Dear cold cruel world why am I here? 
 Flames risin', flames risin' 
 Dear please juse wipe away the tears 
 Flames risin', flames risin'
