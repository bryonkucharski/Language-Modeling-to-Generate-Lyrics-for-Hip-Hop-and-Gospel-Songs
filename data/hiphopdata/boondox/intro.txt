Pitch black was a night a black as could be 
 Pick it up went bam bam blim blim 
 Shut up... I said shut up! 
 The dead lay all around me We all together lay 
 You goan have ta keep that pretty little mouth quiet 
 Oh lord... Trouble done started 
 I said shut up bitch! 
 If you don't shut up Ill bleed you rite here 
 I will not forgive you! None of you will be forgiven! All of you shall feel his wrath! 
 Shut up! 
 The dead lay all around me We all together lay 
 All of you shall feel his wrath! 
 Hush up
