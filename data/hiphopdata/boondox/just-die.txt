 You don' fucked with the wrong one today 
 And you don't want it homie 
 Fuck what you're tryin' to say 
 Your whole existence phony 
 Talkin' so much shit you need'a mutherfuckin breathe mint 
 And when I hit you with that glock 
 You'll wonder where your breathe went 
 Always quick to take the dick up out'cha mouth to jack your jaw 
 Guess you're pissed ya baby bitch would take the time to jack me off 
 But nuttin like what she would be with you, du' 
 She swallowed it 
 Now you wanna give me attitude 
 Bitch, eat a hollowtip 
 Take your own advice and put the barrel in your own mouth 
 Kill your handicap and blow your mutherfuckin brains out 
 Do the world a favor, hoe, and try to fix a big mistake 
 Pull the trigger, send your soul to Hell for fuckin' Heaven's sake 
 Pull the heater on ya 
 Put a hole in your soul 
 Nine millimeter homie 
 Make your blood run cold

 See me on the streets and now you holla at me like we're brothers 
 Then you run your mouth 'cause you's a backstabbin mutherfucker 
 Hide behind computer screens with fake names and magazines 
 Boy, you need'a be a man and grow some nuts to step to me 
 Run upon you, hit'chu with that (one, two; one, two) 
 What'chu gonna do when I (come through, stun you) 
 Peel ya fuckin' cap with a nine millimeter 
 Better run mutherfucker every time that I see ya 
 If I see ya mutherfucker then I wouldn't wanna be ya 
 Hit'cha with them heatseekers 
 I fuckin' ?? I thought I saw a pussy cat 
 I pointed to ya when they askin where the pussy at 
 You cocksuckin-mutherfucker! 
 Check my fuckin' blood-pressure 
 Pop a couple pills and then I'm comin' to get'cha 
 Put a hole in your soul

 I'll pull a driveby on ya in a Coupe De Vile 
 And when I shot to kill, you know I shot with skill 
 And you don't ever see it comin' 
 Got the skills of a Sniper 
 Put the heat through your body, what'cha spill in your diaper 
 For real, you's a liar, like Pinocchio 
 And when you talk, it grows 
 But hoe, it ain't your nose 
 It's the rage in my soul, it's buildin like construction 
 There's a tax on your ass and I'ma make deductions 
 Take ya functions, put'cha in a new shipbag 
 Beg like a bitch and you ain't gonna do shit fag 
 Twelve gage, double barrel, pointed at your teeth 
 Tell your daddy buy a suite and make your momma buy a wreath, piece 
 Pull the heater on ya 
 Put a hole in your soul 
 Nine millimeter homie 
 Make your blood run cold 
 You diiiee 
 Gon' rest your eyes

 Gon' test the fire 
 Pull the heater on ya 
 Put a hole in your soul 
 Nine millimeter homie 
 Make your blood run cold 
 You diiiee 
 Gon' rest your eyes 
 You diiiee 
 Gon' test the fire
