 Tippin up another cupa 
 Sippin on down 
 12 gauge double barrel 
 Loaded full of buckshot 
 Brewin up that mountain dew 
 It boilin like a crockpot 
 Deep out in these southern woods and 
 Far away from ev'rything 
 Out amongest the tombstones 
 Cookin up that hurracain 
 Take a sip for testin then' 
 Pour a littlie on the ground 
 Soak up in that goregia clay 
 And now I'm waitin for the sound 
 150 year buried deep in the earths grip 
 Soon there gonna dancein 
 When that cool water hits there lips 
 Made from the mill 
 Out a feild cursed by whodo 
 Water from a well 
 Striaght outta hell 
 Cursed by vodoo 
 Stir it up cook it to the point that it evaporates 
 173 degrees born again 
 The dead awake

 100 galleons of that right good top stock 
 Ready for the shippin 
 In a heavy chevy small block 
 Foot to the floor 
 Ridin' mean like an out law 
 Duckin dogein road blocks 
 Like boxing with an south paw 
 These dark and dusty roads 
 Light up by the full moon 
 Comin' round the corner 
 Muffler soundin like a moonson 
 I got the devils mean as demons 
 Ridin' shotgun 
 Straped with a winchester 
 Case they have to pop one 
 We headin for the next county 
 On the southin trail 
 G man and revenue hot on me southern tail 
 Hang out the window 
 One blast with the buckshot 
 Need get 'em off my ass so that I don't get got 
 Wild liter??, sugar wiskey, stump pole, skull cracker, alley bourbon, city gin, wildcat, block and tackle 
 Its how we do it 
 How we get it to the next level 
 Have us huntin bitches down 
 With pick axe and shovel 
 Gone of that good shit 
 Hit ya like a mule kick 
 Pick a hater out the crowd 
 And hit 'em with a pool stick 
 Hulleonations seein shit 
 Got ya climbin trees 
 Passed out in a ditch 
 Like a bitch down on ya knees 
 Don't even give a fuck 
 When the spirts hit ya brain 
 Four shots is all ya need 
 Certified gone insane 
 Let's get it crackalackin 
 One more 'gain for the pimpin' 
 Take the jug 
 And turn it up chug it down 
 And start the sippin
