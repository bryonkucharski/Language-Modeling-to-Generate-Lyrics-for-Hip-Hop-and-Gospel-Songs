As the young man I find out that if you hurt somebody 
 Will lead you all, good guys do finish last 
 Am I crazy? Am I insane? 
 Hoodoo is my religion I believe in superstition 
 Come against me and I turn instantly to mortician 
 You need some more coninving? Killer like the son of sam 
 Gruesome with my old depiction twist you like I'm outer realm 
 Homicidle idle survival of the wickedest 
 Got my rival suicidal from how I kick this shit 
 Watch me flick the bic I'm about to light the gas 
 Then I'mma cut your hand off and use that bitch to wipe my ass 
 I'm vicious, my heart has no malice 
 Anti malicious and my trigger finger is so careless 
 From killin' bastards now all I do is swing the hatchet 
 All hail to prime minister definition of sinister 
 Detrimental to industry, breaking bad with my chemistry 
 Trying go out and info me, fuck with me, feel my energy 
 Wicked poetic symphony this is how killers meant to be 
 Boondox and Big Hoodoo no remorse and no symphaty 
 No symphaty, no remorse, cold blooded 
 Sick with it, this how we do 
 No soul, my hearts cold (everybody knows we) 
 Sick with it, this how we do 
 Am I crazy? Sick with it, this how we do 
 Am I insane? Sick with it, this how we do 
 The pain is constant and sharp 
 And this confession? It means nothing 
 The ring around sinking, coming clean like it used to 
 Permament reminder that I got couple screws loose 
 Same with the bathub, same stained hands 
 Drops on the counter top of insane man 
 Thoughts of the flashback, remembering the first time 
 That I realized I was evil of the worst kind 
 Covered toe to head in somebody else's life 
 And laughing when I lost it, lickin' plasma from a knife 
 Staring at the wind, chippin' down from a slow drip 
 Lips on the water fountain, startin' with a slow sip 
 And end it with the crazy mixed pleasure with your shame 
 A little bit of pain from the liquid that I drain 
 Why did I do it? Was it worth the affliction 
 And why did I let to it to become my addiction 
 The body in my conscious bearing out in the mud 
 A blood thristy killer with a real thrist for blood 
 No symphaty, no remorse, cold blooded 
 Sick with it, this how we do 
 No soul, my hearts cold (everybody knows we) 
 Sick with it, this how we do 
 Am I crazy? Sick with it, this how we do 
 Am I insane? Sick with it, this how we do 
 There is no me, only an entity 
 Something illusory 
 No symphaty, no remorse, cold blooded 
 Sick with it, this how we do 
 No soul, my hearts cold (everybody knows we) 
 Sick with it, this how we do 
 Am I crazy? Sick with it, this how we do 
 Am I insane? Sick with it, this how we do 
 No symphaty, no remorse, cold blooded 
 Sick with it, this how we do 
 No soul, my hearts cold (everybody knows we) 
 Sick with it, this how we do 
 Am I crazy? Sick with it, this how we do 
 Am I insane? Sick with it, this how we do
