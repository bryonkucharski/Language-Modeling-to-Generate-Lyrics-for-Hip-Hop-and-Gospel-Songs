Love me tender, love me true 
 Guess what she's goin' do to you 
 Flesh and steel she'll take your life 
 All because the love of my life is a knife 
 Love me tender, love me sweet 
 Cuts right down to the white meat 
 Flesh and steel she'll take your life 
 All because the love of my life is a knife 
 The only thing up on my mind is how to get this bitch undressed 
 She like a new toy straight up out the wrapper 
 Thinkin' 'bout the situation got the butterflies 
 I'm laughin' like a hyena and no she ain't shy neither 
 Everybody that she see will be dyin' when they meet her 
 With a long lean body baby built to perfection 
 Love lookin' at her 'cause I'm seein my reflection 
 Bringin' out the best of me always sittin' next to me 
 Just thinkin' about her in my hands its almost as close as sex to me 
 She keeps my heart beatin' like a high school drum 
 I can't wait till I get home from work so we can spend some time 
 She's lying there when I'm pullin back the cover 
 And its just only me and her but this can't work without another 
 So it's gonna be a late night my bitch is on a mission 
 Lookin' for the next victim about to make this proposition 
 Started off the night up at the tops and tails 
 Bitch be sittin' off the deck and so we hoppin rails 
 Cause my babygirl hot we gotta keep that low profile 
 And what we bout to do could be considered sick and so vile 
 Make a straight line up to the VIP 
 A stripper lady named Mercedes and my girl and me 
 She started dancin for the money lookin' so divine 
 And when my honey touched her skin it sent a shiver up her spine 
 Lookin' at me kinda crazy soundin slightly bold 
 Askin why the fuck my touch be so hard and cold 
 So I'm lookin' at her back but didn't open my mouth 
 Because I knew that it was time to turn this fuckin' whore out 
 Now I'm starin' at her titties feelin' something like a sinner 
 Almost didn't even know that's when my bitch just slid up in her 
 And now its something like a threesome and I'm suckin on her breasts 
 While my baby got her cummin 'cause she's fuckin' her to death 
 My girl the best 
 (Skit)
