Intoxication, filled with the medications 
 Sedation powder made from ?? 
 Put me in this fuckin' situation 
 My lungs are cold and feelin' like they explodin 
 I'm loaded, wrote it all down 
 I'm givin' you this invitation 
 To come and visit me, come into my mind 
 And sit a minute, join the spirits 
 To take the time to unwind and you'll find 
 The DNA ain't fallin' far from the tree 
 Come from a long line of the murderous kind 
 So don't be fuckin' with me 
 You wanna check the history 
 Just pull the newspaper clippin's 
 And find the trailer where it happened 
 I bet the blood is still drippin 
 And I'm sippin on Kerosene, and it's just to make me enabled 
 To let the world know that my family is more than unstable 
 And I might be the black sheep for the secrets that I'm tellin' 
 More than half my bloodline is layin dead on a felon 
 And I ain't sellin no lies, my last name is a curse 
 I'm hopin that I survive yeah, just to finish this verse 
 I see the hearse 
 Kerosene, go get the matches 
 Light this thing and burn the branches 
 End the pain and suffering 
 Burn it up and kill my family tree 
 From way back, I remember my father's expression 
 When the telephone ring at 3am you didn't have to stop and question 
 'Cause we knew that dark cloud was hangin' just like a noose 
 The only thing on our mind was death and who did he choose 
 The time my cousin ate a bullet and my other cousin followed 
 When they sister heard the news, that's when the Drano got swallowed 
 Seen my first closed-casket just before I could talk 
 And I almost met the same fate just before I could walk 
 I lost my aunt to a pistol with her husband on the other end 
 Nine years old and already noticed a trend 
 So many friends dead and buried 
 Many coffins been carried 
 On a first name basis with too many cemeteries 
 And I'm weary of my fate, scared for the ??kids, and me?? 
 Cursed like the Von Erichs, somethin' like the ??Kennedy's?? 
 Say a prayer for me, if you're down on a knee 
 And pray to God you ain't branches on my dyin' family tree 
 Kerosene, go get the matches 
 Light this thing and burn the branches 
 End the pain and suffering 
 Burn it up and kill my family tree 
 Chop, chop, chop it down 
 When a dead tree fall, does it make a sound 
 Chop, chop, chop it down 
 When a dead tree fall, does it make a sound 
 Chop, chop, chop it down 
 When a dead tree fall, does it make a sound 
 Chop, chop, chop it down 
 When a dead tree fall, does it make a sound 
 Kerosene, go get the matches 
 Light this thing and burn the branches 
 End the pain and suffering 
 Burn it up and kill my family tree
