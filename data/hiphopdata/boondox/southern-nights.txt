Southern nights are sippin on Henny 
 Southern nights are rolling up that good 
 Southern nights are hot sticky and muggy 
 Doublewide tucked in the woods 
 Southern nights are pitchforks and gravel 
 Southern nights are shooting cans of beer 
 Southern nights are chasing them donkies 
 Bitch why don't you and your girl get over here 
 The Southern moon exposes killers 
 The Southern moon is hot like fire 
 The Southern moon it knows our weakness 
 Trips you up like chicken wire 
 Southern nights are warm and sticky 
 Southern nights are swampy and loud 
 Southern nights are home to the Skarcrow 
 Posted up under the moon and proud 
 Won't you take me back to the dark so pitch black 
 Most can't see where we at it's where I'm happy 
 Southern nights are tipped back on SoCo 
 Southern nights are flippin off the PoPo 
 Southern nights are cruising in a big block 
 Foot to the floor quarter miles in a parking lot 
 Southern nights are hunting chickens with a spotlight 
 Southern nights are shooting at a stop sign 
 Southern nights are trolling in the pitch black 
 Out on the lake with a six pack laid back 
 The Southern air stings with mosquitos 
 The Southern air gets hard to breathe though 
 Shot gun blasts with crazies chasing 
 Won't you take me back to the dark so pitch black 
 Most can't see where we at it's where I'm happy 
 It's where I am one with this land I've become 
 Take me home take me back it's where I'm happy 
 Southern nights are going to the dope house 
 Southern nights are gotta take the short route 
 Southern nights are chasing that rabbit 
 Blows to the nose 'cause you know you gotta have it 
 Southern nights are your bitch giving you skins 
 Southern nights are your finger in her best friend 
 Southern nights are getting head on a dirt road 
 If she ain't down she can walk her ass home 
 The Southern mud will tap your luck 
 The Southern mud will trap you shut 
 The Southern mud will snatch you up 
 Some say that's why it's red like blood 
 Southern nights are drunk in the Waffle House 
 Southern nights are fucked up so we wild and loud 
 Southern nights are sun up when we get up 
 Take your ass to sleep 'cause we gotta do it all again 
 Won't you take me back to the dark so pitch black 
 Most can't see where we at it's where I'm happy 
 It's where I am one with this land I've become 
 Take me home take me back it's where I'm happy 
 Knee deep in the swamps far from any others it's where I'm happy 
 Underneath the trees where the green roof covers it's where I'm happy 
 Where it gets so dark you don't know if you're still alive it's where I'm Happy 
 Please let me die under dark southern skies it's where I'm happy
