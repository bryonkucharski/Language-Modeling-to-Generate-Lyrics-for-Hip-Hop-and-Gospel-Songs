We walk all alone 
 Always on our own 
 We walk all alone 
 Always on our own 
 I remember when life was a struggle 
 It ain't all roses now but back then it was double 
 I remember when 
 When I ain't have no pot 
 When you piss on the floor you stay pissed of a lot 
 I remember when I was searchin for answers 
 In the house of a dealer in the arms of a dancer 
 I remember when I thought I was finished 
 You been down this road then give me a witness 
 We walk all alone 
 Always on our own 
 Get lost on the way 
 And sometimes need 
 To find the way home 
 But we walk all alone 
 We walk all alone 
 Always on our own 
 Get lost on the way 
 And sometimes need 
 To find the way home 
 But we walk all alone 
 When you walk on your own and you ain't got crystal 
 The future yu sees at the end of a pistol 
 Lookin' for clues that end up in wronge places 
 So many troubles and so many faces 
 Got blood on my hands from some crocked decisions 
 Blood on my heart from some painful divisions 
 Askin myself if I would take it all back 
 No I wouldn't this is my path 
 We walk all alone 
 Always on our own 
 Get lost on the way 
 And sometimes need 
 To find the way home 
 But we walk all alone 
 We walk all alone 
 Always on our own 
 Get lost on the way 
 And sometimes need 
 To find the way home 
 But we walk all alone 
 I remember when I left you there cryin 
 You was down on the floor and looked like you was dyin' 
 I remember when I seen you out drinkin' 
 Surrounded by dudes it felt like I was sinkin 
 I remember when I pulled the foe-five 
 The safey was on and so you still alive 
 I remember when I was in holding stressin 
 But lucky as hell 'cause they ain't find the weapon 
 We walk all alone 
 Always on our own 
 Get lost on the way 
 And sometimes need 
 To find the way home 
 But we walk all alone 
 We walk all alone 
 Always on our own 
 Get lost on the way 
 And sometimes need 
 To find the way home 
 But we walk all alone 
 So now that I'm grown and I'm thinkin' bout shit 
 'Bout the life that I lived and the things I did 
 All the ones that are hurt 
 The ones who where there 
 All the people that fucked my and made me aware 
 You got to be strong to stand on your own 
 You goin' to do some wright and you goin' do some wrong 
 But when it's all over just lay there and laugh 
 You're dyin' alone but you stayed on the path 
 We walk all alone 
 Always on our own 
 Get lost on the way 
 And sometimes need 
 To find the way home 
 But we walk all alone 
 We walk all alone 
 Always on our own 
 Get lost on the way 
 And sometimes need 
 To find the way home 
 But we walk all alone
