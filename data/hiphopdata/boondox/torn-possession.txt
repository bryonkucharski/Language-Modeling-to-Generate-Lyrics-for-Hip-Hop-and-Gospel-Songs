I can hear (?) but I can't find a way 
 I can feel myself falling but I can't find my 
 Angels in my ear tellin' me don't 'let go' 
 Demons in my ear tellin' me to let go 
 When I'm fightin for my sould and the both want control 
 I'm surrounded by the dark become a stranger to the light 
 Put all my hopes into the fact that everything will be all right 
 But as I sit here crippled nervous in a state of shock 
 Times become my enemy I'm staring at a broken clock 
 And every hour on the hour some thing strange is taking place 
 Apparitions on the wall voices and my soul is raped 
 I can't explain it am I burnin' in that fire pit? 
 Has the devil come to claim what's his for all the times I needed shit? 
 I tried sleeping but still I could feel it creepin' 
 Call off the deakon bloods leakin right from the ceiling 
 I hear the rain fallin' tappin on my window sill 
 Shadows crawling babies crying make it all seem so surreal 
 And what's that tickin in my head 
 I know for sure that I ain't dead 
 If that's the case then why the fuck am I still sittin' in my bed 
 I'm tryna scream but no sounds so I'm reachin' for the fone 
 I need to call some one right now to tell me what's goin' on 
 Seven days and nights go by and I ain't seen the fuckin' sun 
 Layin here surrounded by a preist som crosses and a nun 
 Speakin' in a foreign language but I seem to understand 
 Crucifix is burnin flesh right when they placed it in my hand 
 Holy water feels like torture fallin' on my head 
 Demons whisper in my ear don't worry son your almost dead 
 Moms cryin daddies packin pictures flyin on the wall 
 I can hear my grandma talk in tongues some where down the hall 
 (Backwards talk) 
 Next thing I noticed I'm wakin' up I'm in an empty room 
 Some what unfamiliar was I sleepin' in an empty tomb 
 And then a light from up above 
 I heard a voice filled with love 
 A lady dressed all in while I didn't who she was 
 And I can't explain the calm 
 After the shock pain in my arm 
 All I know is I feel warm ad I don't care what's goin' on 
 (x2:) 
 Demons demons demons (backwards talk)
