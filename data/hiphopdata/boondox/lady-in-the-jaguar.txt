*Umm excuse me could you help me out?? Umm I lost the fuckin' freeway and I'm tryin' to find my way back. I guess I'm just a little bit lost.* 
 It was late one night in the 404. 
 I was gone off that water chillin' on the front porch. 
 I was leaned back laxin and puffin on some swag. 
 When a bitch came up in a tight ass jag. 
 She pulled right in the driveway bumpin clint black. 
 When she stepped out the ride I had to take a step back. 
 She had long blonde hair and a ass that wouldn't quit. 
 Titties fallin' all out because the shirt didn't fit. 
 Started walkin' up to me then she drops the keys. 
 Kneeled down to pick them up and all I saw was g-string. 
 Pussy lips hangin' out and it was the shit. 
 Now I'm sprung on this bitch in a SJ6.

 *Oh my god... Umm excuse me Umm I'm not from around here and Umm I was wondering if you could hook a bitch up with some of that you know that really good, good, booger sugar?* 
 It was jumpin' down town on a sat night. 
 I was wipin car windows on a corner street light. 
 She was parlay in a monte green jaguar. 
 She locked her doors now what you do that for? 
 I could see she had a dead fox chillin' on her shoulder. 
 Blonde highlighted hair her face a little older. 
 I knocked on her windshield and kissed the glass. 
 I think I prolly scared a dune out her ass. 
 But she peeled my wig back and offered me a ride. 
 Smiled at a juggalo and told me get inside. 
 I'm like hell yeah bitch you old rich freak. 
 I went to get in, She peeled off and ran over my feet.

 Oh shit who that rollin' down the block. 
 Another closet smoker lookin' for some rock. 
 And a jag pulled up and the window rolled down. 
 I'm lookin' for the infamous Shags The Clown. 
 I tried to say what up but before I had the chance. 
 I seen her camel toes tryin' to push through her pants. 
 So I said come here bitch she said what for? 
 She grabbed me by the pants and opened up the door. 
 She pulled out her titties said she likes kinky stuff. 
 And that if I wanted the neden I had to put on these handcuffs. 
 She cuffed me to the seat Hey Yo What the hell? 
 She said I'm takin' you in for jumpin' your bail.
