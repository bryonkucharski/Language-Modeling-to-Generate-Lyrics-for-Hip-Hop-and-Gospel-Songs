Straight out the crops 
 Straight out the crops 
 Straight out the crops 
 Straight out the stix 
 Straight out the stix 
 Straight out the stix 
 Straight out the stix 
 Straight out the crops 
 Straight out the crops 
 Straight out the crops 
 Straight out the stix 
 Straight out the stix 
 Straight out the stix 
 Straight out the stix 
 Who it be? The doc's comin' straight from the crops 
 I'm thinking switches for these bitches as dirtay as Woodstock 
 And when I chop, the shock goes straight up your vertabrate 
 They pickin' at yo bones, and at your watch just like a bird of prey 
 A sick son of a bitch call me the scarecrow 
 A face-painted doll, the Blair-witch with a foe foe 
 And I stay on the prow, my nose like a blood hound 
 Straight stalking muther fucker showing this how it goes down 
 This sight of blood it gets me higher than an astronaut 
 A backwoods monster shot gutted a master plot 
 To burn yo cities and murder all yo committees 
 Do? to Do? slangin lead never showin no pity 
 I bring the pain to ya brain though they callin me drama 
 Choking at ya neck, with a chain I think ya dead mama 
 It ain't da same since the sane went insane mama 
 Time to show these haters how to play da fucking game mama 
 Straight out the crops I won't stop ima POP! POP! POP!, until they all drop 
 Straight out the stix I won't quit, I know you feeling this shit, you must be feelin' this shit. Yeah! 
 I comin' straight out da stix, and all da shit dat I spit 
 It be as dirty as a gathering of 2006 
 And yeah I grip like a tee write the words of these pricks 
 Who all hatein throwin' away because they say I'm a hit 
 But I ain't apologizing, hell no I say fuck em 
 After sunning with a hatchet then these hoes ain't doin' nothin' 
 So just quit of all y'all frontin and then get down on yo knees 
 Pray to God dat I don't find you and then dislocate yo spleen 
 Cause you never wanna see me bitch jumping out of trees a shear 
 Wrap my hands around yo throat and send you up to Jesus bitch 
 Quick to see ya to ya maker, quicker than the undertaker 
 Put you through a shredder and then spread you on a hundred acres 
 Keep my name upon your mouth, keep yo ass upon da south 
 Ya mami ain't raise ya right, ima bout to show her how 
 Please don't make me fetch da steel, make this cap an extra pill 
 Pop you like a cherry mutha fucka never test my will 
 (Chorus x2 until song ends)
