She lies awake for days suffering in misery 
 No one to hold her close and give her what she really needs 
 Blood flows like a busted nose 
 Red fluid drains down and it stains your clothes 
 No rest no strength ain't been fed in days 
 Down in the cellar kept you locked away 
 My one true love and I said I adored you 
 Walks in the parks so I never ignored you 
 We held hands in the dark as the band played 
 Looked you in you eyes told you never to be afraid 
 I knew it wouldn't last but I wanted you forever 
 Had to find a way for us to stay together 
 That's when it happened and the thoughts came clear 
 A smile on my face as I whispered in your ear 
 Come walk with me come walk into the night 
 Sip champagne with me lay beside the candle light 
 I took her hand and the last word said 
 I made her mine forever with a blow to the head 
 She lies awake for days suffering in misery 
 No one to hold her close and give her what she really needs 
 I know I want to see here be with her all throught the night 
 And so I'm waiting for her last goodbye 
 It was a song walk her over my shoulder 
 Thinking about the moments and the things tat I told her 
 Throught the swamp through the fields 
 Past an old barn I never felt so alive my baby in my arms 
 I looked down at the ground I saw her blood drop 
 Had to get her back fast couldn't lose her on the trip 
 So many things that I needed us to do 
 I call it love others might call it taboo 
 But I don't give a fuck her happiness is all I need 
 Pleasure that she's looking for when I make her bleed 
 Down on her knees praying for the first injection 
 Loving is to suffer have her praying for the resurrection 
 At my doorstep sat her down let us in 
 Looked in her pretty face wiped the blood from her chin 
 Over the threshold I swept this girl right off her feet 
 The time is getting near for this fairytale to be complete 
 She lies awake for days suffering in misery 
 No one to hold her close or give her what she really needs 
 I know I want to see here be with her all throught the night 
 And so I'm waiting for her last goodbye 
 Down the stairs around the corner to her new home 
 Coming to her senses and she's knowing something's going up 
 Eyes glazed she looked at me as if to say 
 Tell me what you've done and please make this all go away 
 But no words no sound from her precious lips 
 She reached and touched me softly with her broken bloody fingertips 
 The tear fell reality was sinking in 
 In utter shock and disbelief at this unforgiven sin 
 The smell of death like a reminder echoes through the walls 
 Knowing that she sits all alone down those darkened halls 
 I want to hold her touch her lay beside her never leave 
 But the sadness on her face will never let it be 
 And so she sits and stares just waiting for her final breath 
 A mix of love and broken heart wishing for her death 
 And on this night I sit here waiting for the end 
 When I can walk those darkened halls and be with her again 
 She lies awake for days in misery 
 No one to hold her close or give her what she really needs 
 I know I want to see here be with her all throught the night 
 And so I'm waiting for her last goodbye
