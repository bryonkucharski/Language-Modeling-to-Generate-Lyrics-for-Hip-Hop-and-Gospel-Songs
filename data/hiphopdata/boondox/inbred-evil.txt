Godforsaken left to rot an orphaned bastard child 
 Mutated product born of incest left out in the wild 
 A bloody bastard lies abandoned still tied to the cord 
 Opens his eyes to see more darkness in an evil world 
 So much pain filled with hate it shapes his simple mind 
 Don't know how don't know why no sense of days no sense of time 
 All he knows is what he sees and that's the beast of fame 
 Rippin' flesh kill to survive embedded in his fuckin' brain 
 Raised by the woods provided goods enough for sure survival 
 No way to read but in his hands he totes a tattered bible 
 He doesn't have a name but in his soul's just pure conviction 
 He knows there's more like him and they gon' pay for his affliction 
 There ain't gon be no sequel 
 This here is inbred evil 
 Everybody must die 
 Everybody must die 
 Everybody must die 
 There ain't gon be no sequel 
 This here is inbred evil 
 Everybody must die 
 Everybody must die 
 Everybody must die 
 Like canopies all the trees provide the perfect cover 
 Hikers bikers campers steamed up windows from the youngest lovers 
 Unaware of the eyes that watch just waitin' patient 
 Licks his lips and grins excited droolin' heart is fuckin' racing 
 So many lost on these roads and trails that lead out here 
 Slaughtered ripped to pieces open stomachs like a baby deer 
 You see the fear on the faces like they starin' at hell 
 Flies and maggots feastin' on remains a putrid fuckin' smell 
 And in the distance yards away another shadow lights 
 Gutted like a fish up in the hidden shadows covered like 
 Another crime scene just like a couple hundred others 
 Naked left to day out in the open wait to be discovered 
 There ain't gon' be no sequel 
 This here is inbred evil 
 Everybody must die 
 Everybody must die 
 Everybody must die 
 There ain't gon' be no sequel 
 This here is inbred evil 
 Everybody must die 
 Everybody must die 
 Everybody must die 
 He's alone in the home his family left behind 
 On the couch his ma and pa are sittin' missin' eyes 
 Throughout the rooms and halls the story of a broken boy 
 Bodies line the walls in pairs each one they hold a broken toy 
 The smell that lingers every corner filled with pure disease 
 Entrails hung like Christmas lights they decorate the mantelpiece 
 A blackened gutted in the tub bubbles up like tar 
 The still remains mixed with brains pickled in a jar 
 Everywhere you look sickness fills this little shack 
 Fingers on the table placed as set up for a little snack 
 This is the product of a broken inbred situation 
 Proof that man is born evil been that way since our creation 
 There ain't gon' be no sequel 
 This here is inbred evil 
 Everybody must die 
 Everybody must die 
 Everybody must die 
 There ain't gon' be no sequel 
 This here is inbred evil 
 Everybody must die 
 Everybody must die 
 Everybody must die
