I'm fuckin' walkin' 
 I'm fuckin' walkin' out in the moon light 
 After midnight searching for you 
 Boondox: 
 Out After midnight searchin lerkin hurtin' howlin 
 At the fuckin' moon I watch the neighbors closing curtains turning 
 Out the porch lights and I don't even know why 
 On a stroll all alony like nobodies gonna die 
 I'm just looking for the answers to the questions that I'm asking 
 More lost then when I started darted 
 This means that time is passing barely grasping 
 To the moment and irrational thoughts 
 And this prescription in my pocket got me feeling distraught 
 Its just a matter of time I feel my brain is growing vacant 
 What the fuck is going on I'm like an old timers patient 
 And this situation it seems like déjà vu 
 I wish I had an explanation and I pray I knew 
 How I got to where I'm going what I'm trying to find 
 Looking for my sanity but I lost my fuckin' mind 
 No where to be found I think I need some fuckin' help 
 Walking after midnight and I'm searching for myself 
 I'm fucking walking (fucking walking) 
 Out in the moonlight (through the darkness) 
 After midnight (hay) 
 Searching for you (I'm trying to find you) 
 Violent J: 
 Right foot over left 
 Left foot over right 
 I let my dog out to piss in the middle of the night 
 In my backyard illuminated by the moonlight 
 Was a women in the haze and from the back she's looking tight 
 Worry not he don't bite but why are you in my yard miss 
 She waved me on to fallow and then ran into the darkness 
 All I had on were slippers still a gave a chase 
 Fallowing an angle and I have yet to see her face 
 With ease she passes through trees her gown blows in the breeze 
 I'm slapping though puddles and scratching up my knees 
 Please tell me your name and where the hell where headed 
 To the cemetery where the answers are imbedded on her tombstone 
 She's home 
 She stopped running 
 I finally caught up and was about to ask something 
 When she turned around a demon 
 A snake for a tongue 
 And it bite me food for the dead I've become 
 I'm fucking walking (fucking walking) 
 Out in the moonlight (through the darkness) 
 After midnight (hay) 
 Searching for you (I'm trying to find you) 
 Shaggy 2 Dope: 
 What's ding-a-linging nothing in my drawer 
 Chasing after that dragon but not the hara boy 
 Its big and shinny and dripping with blood 
 Why'd I do 
 Because I said that I could 
 Now my only problem I'm looking for that tool 
 When I hit him with it all I seen was dripping 'n' drool 
 But I put it somewhere 
 Where 
 We can all guess 
 The simple fact is I blacked out and slit her neck 
 Back to the problem at hand 
 Memories of motherfucker wit him looking for that murder weapon 
 If I had recollection I wouldn't have to sweat police 
 Now my drawers are open sweating trying to find this piece 
 I can't miss it if I see it wooden handle shinny edge 
 Shredding it every angle as if I jump off a league 
 Picking through the leaves digging through the dirt 
 Hiding every breath I'm talking I'm gonna make this shit work 
 I'm fucking walking (fucking walking) 
 Out in the moonlight (through the darkness) 
 After midnight (hay) 
 Searching for you (I'm trying to find you) 
 Repeats: 
 (Hay)
