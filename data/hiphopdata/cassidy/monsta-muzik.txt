Seriously no one can compare to me 
 Niggas scared of me 
 I'm still ill I'm gon' need therapy 'cause lyrically I'ma 
 And I'm hot it's not a conspiracy 
 My bars sick I could star in a horror flick I'ma 
 And all my bars hard as shit 
 I spit crack, if you hear me rap it's gonna be hard to quit 
 I'ma hustla ain't no drug hard to flip 
 But in the hood they drugs hard to get, my strip got that 
 You a target you ain't hard to hit 
 I'll get you smoked like a jar of piff, my clip full of 
 And the Ferrari I can hardly fit 
 I'm in a truck that's Ferrari quick, that bitch is a... 
 Spend more dollars get more horsepower 
 I stay with the haze but I got the kush and some more sour 
 Comin' in a couple more hours, why not? 
 I buy dutches by the 55 box, I'ma 
 And you could always come to my block 
 We always open like IHOP, we trap like 
 And I don't think these guys hot 
 They can't look me in the eyes like cyclops 
 That's why they not 
 And your john is on my jock 
 I got her panties wet you can't find a dry spot 
 She let me squirt it in her face like eye drops
