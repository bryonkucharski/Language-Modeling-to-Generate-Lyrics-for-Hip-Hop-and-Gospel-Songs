 Hey you know what you remind me of 
 The sun that shines above I think that I'm in 
 Love 'cause every time I look in your eyes 
 They be dumb bright like the sunlight 
 When I look in the sky and you always look fly, 
 You stay with a mean outfit 
 And got shoes that didn't even come out yet. 
 Always got your your nails done, always got yourself fixed 
 You da type of chick I can see me going out wit 
 And I ain't knockin' yo hustle but you should be 
 Somebody's wifey icey wit a rock on your knuckle 
 And we would look hot as a couple 
 'Cause you shaped so beautifully and 
 You almost as cute as me

 And undress yourself and after we have sex 
 Don't stress yourself 'cause I still respect you 
 If you respect yourself girl it's whatever I get da 
 Chedda when we get together it don't be no better 
 And you can see I'm throwin' it 'cause my arm 
 On chill it look like I spilled freon on it.

 To put a three story elevator in my yacht they goin' 
 Keep hatin' it boo, but keep holdin' me
