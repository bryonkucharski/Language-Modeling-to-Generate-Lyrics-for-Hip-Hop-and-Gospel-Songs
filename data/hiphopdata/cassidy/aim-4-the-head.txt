 Swizz Beats and The Game: 
 Swizz Beats: 
 Aim 4 the head 
 When you see 'em go get 'em nigga 
 Aim 4 the head 
 When you see 'em go get 'em nigga 
 Aim 4 the head 
 When you see 'em go get 'em nigga 
 The Game: 
 Cass let they ass know you ain't playin' wit' 'em 
 Swizz Beats: 
 Aim 4 the head 
 When you see 'em go get 'em nigga 
 Aim 4 the head 
 When you see 'em go get 'em nigga 
 Aim 4 the head 
 When you see 'em go get 'em nigga 
 Cassidy: 
 Game let them lames know you ain't playin' wit' 'em 
 The Game: 
 I got my slugs on 
 Gettin' my thug on 
 New Aero prim low Giovanni rims, oh 
 The Phantom got curtains you can't see through the tint so 
 Bought a 45 put the beer on the window 
 It's me and Swiggle for shizzle 
 V twizzle the pistols 
 Cock it back if you carry a missile 
 Then cross both of your arms nigga fold it back 
 If you missed Soulja Slim do da Nolia Clap 
 All recliner seats in the Rover back 
 Yeah it's me and Young Cass till HOV come back 
 You wanna see us both dead then load ya gat 
 We be da first niggaz to bring Pennyloafers back 
 Why niggaz wanna see my R-I-P 
 Empty the clip in a nigga before I D-I-E 
 Prayin' on my downfall like B-I-G 
 I be in da cockpit ride dirty like T-I-P 
 Po-po pull me over wanna see ID 
 Searchin' my shit, tryna find my 3 times 3 
 They don't know I got 4 times 4 in the back seat 
 With enough bodies on to get a nigga 5 times 5 
 Other niggaz snitch on 'em 
 Like if you got the Rover parked crooked in the front he might have bricks on 'em 
 I send the lamp back like a brotha in Rich Porter 
 When I bone you again you a buck 50 like 6 Quarters, yeah 
 Cassidy: 
 Shit real I know how baggin' a whole brick feel 
 Big deal hit da garage and switch wheels 
 My chicks real with the Ménage and tip drills 
 Gimmie a massage then show me how them lips feel 
 And I'ma grind 'cause I'm shinein' on the strip steel 
 And I grip steel, still keep the clips filled 
 Everything I spit real 
 Everything I spit ill 
 Everything I spit sick for real 
 Ain't shit switch 
 Ain't shit change 
 Like Rick James I'm rich bitch 
 Get change, big chain to wrist glist 
 I'm with Game I'ma make cake like biscuits 
 My album went gold in a month, that was a quick flip 
 Don't say shit bitch 
 'Cause niggaz with the lip get 
 Every one in the gun till it go click click 
 And I'ma switch clips and squeeze like toothpaste 
 Palm over my forearm so I could shoot straight 
 I'm 'bout to make it hard to eat like toothaches 
 My flow dope like I go in the booth and shoot base 
 Deuce deuce the 'scapes in the coupe grape 
 I ain't broke I got coke by the suitcase 
 My boots laced I got the base in them white keys 
 I'ma bout to cop the Convertible crib like Ice-T's 
 And dat ice on your sleeve dat's light cheese 
 I spend 100 Gs a year on white Tees 
 The Game: 
 If you wanna go to war then pop sumthin' 
 If you wanna go to war then pop sumthin' 
 If you wanna go to war then pop sumthin' 
 You can't afford a Swizz track nigga stop frontin'
