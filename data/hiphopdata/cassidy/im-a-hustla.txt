 Royalty checks come like once in a blue moon, 
 But I'm getting my dough from doing shows, 
 I made more dough on the grind than going gold, 
 That's why I stay fly I'm flogin' on hoes, 
 Flossin' so cool in a austin no shoes, 
 Just a rubberband on my wrist no jewels, 
 I ain't got to prove I'm rich, I'm no fool, 
 I know the rules and I got time for it, 
 But the nigga will shine when it's time for it, 
 And they will hate you deal with the real cake, 
 And they on the corner from morning till real late,

 To get paid you got saved don't be spending the change, 
 In 5th grade I was hustling my genesis games, 
 I was dumb young, selling chewing gum to my classmates, 
 On the cash chase, moving at a fast pace, 
 Never been a dummy, never did what the dummys do, 
 So I had to mil to burn before I turned twenty two, 
 More money more problems is true, 
 'Cause the more money I make the more problems for you, 
 Yeah I use dude voice, props to the boy sean, 
 He made it a hot line, I made it a hot song, 
 So stop drawn man you gotta respect it, 
 I'm the best swizz got it perfected, 
 Don't mess with C-A double S-I-D-Y, 
 'Cause I became the best when B-I-G died, 
 The kid do it big like P-U-N, 
 'Cause I'm nice like P-A-C with the P-E-N end 
 I'm a hustla, I'm a I'm a hustla homie, (yeah)
