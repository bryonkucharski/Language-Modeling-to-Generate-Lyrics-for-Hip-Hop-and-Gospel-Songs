Shake it I want to see you shake it 
 I ain't gon fake it I want to see you naked it 
 Girl you got figure make a nigga want to taste it 
 Lay your face on the pillow cases 
 And see if you can Take it 
 Yeah dis cat in the business 
 600 on the back of my benzes 
 It's nothin' 
 I lay back in my drop and get my roll on 
 I took my old jon back to the lot like take it 
 And my ****** be mind blown 
 Big face watch 5 different time zones 
 And they ain't rinestones 
 They a couple of thou 
 And this just one of my styles so take it 
 (Girl) 
 Daddy you know I want to shake it 
 The way I shake it make you want to break it 
 (Cassidy) 
 Ain't nothin' stop frontin what's poppin' boo 
 If you want it all you got to do is come take it 
 (Girl) 
 Daddy I know you gon make it 
 And when you make it you still gon take it 
 (Cassidy) 
 Stand up if you makin' somethin' 
 Stand up if you takin' somethin' OK? 
 Some niggas want to live this life but can't live it 
 I know what it's like to want it and can't get it 
 I know what it's like to be broke 
 That's why every time I get a good price on a ***** 
 Ima take it 
 Everything I write is a quote 
 And for that butta you be bitin the toast 
 I'm back on my grissel and my raps official 
 Any chance I get to clap my ***** man ima take it 
 You should ride for ya man and if worst come to worst 
 You should die for ya man 
 But if I run up and pull it and shoot at your man 
 Would you jump in front of the bullet and take it 
 If it ain't one thing damn it's anotha 
 Hand in hand I sold grams of butta 
 Man I was drug dealin' 'cause I love the feelin' of handin a couple grand 
 To my motha like take it 
 Look I'm off the chain 
 I get all the bitches all the brain 
 My sound goin' down in the hall of fame 
 And all y'all gon call the name CASSIDY 
 And ima take it flip it bounce it and switch it up 
 I take herbs by tha ounces and twist it up 
 Listen up wit the mic in my hand it's like I got ya life in my hands and 
 Ima take it 
 Take it!
