 Gotta put food on the table (You hustle!) 
 Gotta keep the family strong

 Check it, you can fear or respect it 
 I wanna thank HOV for clearin the record (aight) 
 If you don't like this song right here, then your ears infected 
 You need to get your hearing corrected 
 Stones clear in the necklace, I wear so much plat on my neck 
 It put bruises on the back of my neck, that's why cats is upset 
 But I told you I'ma shine when its time to 
 I put too much time and I been rhymin since nine too 
 I knew "I'm a Hustla" was a hit 
 Cause everything I ever got I had to hustle to get 
 Ain't nobody give me nothing for free 
 But I'd probably be dead or in jail if it wasn't for T 
 Gettin' booked is a bitch and catchin a slug, scary 
 I need to feed my seed, thanks for the love Mary 
 But seein me without the grams on the grind 
 Is like seein' Wesley Snipes in the tanning salon 
 I'm... the Hustla (the Hustla...) (yeah) 
 (Cassidy trynna make dudes do a hustla dance) 
 Do that dance, do that dance 
 If you a hustla then do that dance 
 Yeah, let's go 
 Do that dance, do that dance 
 If you a hustla then do that dance 
 Yeah, let's go 
 Do that dance, do that dance 
 It ain't a bunch of frontin' in here (yeah)

 Gotta hold my man down 
 We ain't playin' around 
 Got his back at all 
 If you a hustla then do that dance 
 Yeah, let's go
