The block pop so the strip full 
 Rocks, got a fist full 
 Ball pop shit, that hot shit I gotta click for 
 When I start sparking 
 It be barking like pit bulls 
 Matter fact rockwallas 
 When I let them shots holler 
 Chicks on my cock 
 I'm still on the block holla 
 It's Cops on the block 
 They still gone cop colla 
 I got god sense and that's why I got dollars 
 I was told the rules, 
 I'm old school like My pop father 
 I was showed the moves 
 Schooled by the older dudes 
 How to show improve 
 So I move like a solder move 
 Real militant, I'm I'll still killing it 
 Them real guys that's paralyzed and still peeling it 
 Yeah I'm still on my feet and my toes 
 Getting higher than the presidential suit at the nose 
 Getting higher than the nose bleed seats at my Shows 
 Fuck a maybach I play the back seats to the rows 
 Fuck a GT I pull up in a CLS 
 The butt soft like my female breast 
 Is it a b12 yes 
 I cop the uncoppable 
 Nigga you can't stop the unstoppable 
 Nigga I pop a shot through you niggas 
 And and I was like a pop for you niggas 
 I gave you a flow adopted you niggas 
 I did a lot 4 you niggas 
 And this the fucking thanks I get 
 You my son you should thank my dick 
 You take my shit, flip it around 
 And Now you think you sick 
 I guess you think you cass 
 But I think you trash 
 And I spank that ass 
 You ain't fucking with me 
 You wouldn't even rap like that if it wasn't 4 me 
 I been had my weight up 
 How you gone battle me 
 With a style that I made up 
 When I'm home it's envy 
 I'm feeling like the ball 
 When he was on the phone with 
 What the fuck is goin' on out hea 
 What the fuck is niggas doin' out hea 
 Niggas drawn out hea 
 Ya block hot, I put a drawn out thea 
 My block hot, Ya shit warm out there 
 So we gone out there 
 Set up shop and get it on out there 
 I'm on point like a thorn out here 
 Come to Philly I'm a don out here 
 Yeah you know I'm a boss dog 
 Live than st ives I've 
 It's lacrose dog 
 I floss dog, and I stay with my jewelz on 
 You prolly wouldn't see this much ice in a hell storm 
 It's nothing 2 flash, But fucking with cass 
 Would get you bucked or bumbed in tha ass 
 'Cause it's only a handful a rappers 
 That's touchinq the cash 
 And most of them getting fucked in they ass 
 It's snakes up in the grass 
 But cass gone blast when the beef is on 
 I walk w| the shells & I ain't got no adidas on 
 I squeeze the john even if the law watchen 
 I'm 2 hard the rap version of banard hoppkins
