You can hate me or love me 
 (Hate, hate me or love me) 
 You can hate me or love me 
 (Hate me or love me) 
 I'm grinding still making this money 
 I'm making this guap 
 No you ain't taking it from me 
 You ain't taking my spot 
 You can hate me or love me 
 (Hate, hate me or love me) 
 You can hate me or love me 
 (Hate me or love me) 
 I'm grinding still making this money 
 I'm making this cake 
 No you ain't taking it from me 
 You ain't taking my place 
 So you can hate me or love me 
 I'm still spending my clientele cheese 
 I ain't gotta sell keys 
 I'm a boss I own companies LLC's 
 I floss the ice on my cross could make hell freeze 
 My wheel cost a quarter mil my rims cost 12 g's 
 I had paper before I was selling LP's 
 That's why I get more head than the female weave 
 ?? Weed till I could bare leave the hell brief 
 Anytime you turn around I'm smoking I burn it down 
 I'm burning now what I steam green as Kermit now 
 I seen so much money my eyes like Eric Sermon's now 
 Life a bitch but shit I can't turn her down 
 I'm addicted to the biscuit can't put the burner down 
 I got Mount Erie Oaklane German town 
 Northwest and South Philly riding out with me 
 So I doubt you dudes wanna shoot it out with me 
 We Bad Boys getting Dirty Money without Diddy 
 I want more riches and more bitches the boy vicious 
 Everyday different gear every year my car switches 
 I just bought a house bout as large as a straw bridge is 
 Ridiculous, four floors big as a department store 
 Yours the size of the garage where I park my car 
 Cause you only sold a little rock like Arkansas 
 I mess with Aki's that'll spark at y'all 
 They'll catch a body then get back on they ?? and scream ?? 
 I ain't selfish y'all I'm more of a boss than y'all 
 I look better got more cheddar and got more heart than y'all 
 You from the projects but you ain't never walked the hall 
 Plus you wasn't in the streets you only hustle in your sleep 
 That's why they call it street dreams you niggas sweet 
 I ain't skip a beat I'm still spitting like I'm missing teeth 
 I'm so sick man I took it over with no permission 
 I'm getting money hate me or love me it's your decision 
 I really made it you really love it or really hate it 
 I'm sick a lunatic I need to be facilitated 
 You niggas gon' flop if you not affiliated 
 I'm a Philly native for real don't get humiliated 
 I make a brick sell fast as rock ?? 
 I spit fishscale when my fans ain't rehabilitated 
 All the songs I brung out got 'em strung out 
 You had your chance to shine but your time bout to run out
