Mr. Sandman's showing his beam. 
 When walks into the room, 
 Walls lean in to listen. 
 Surf out bank waves, 
 Click back and forth I go. 
 Headlights sipping bottles through a candle 
 Head like a steal trap 
 Wish I didn't 
 I didn't (6x) 
 I don't 
 Just want to be a footnote in someone else's happiness 
 Does your husband know the way 
 That the sun shine gleams from your wedding band 
 Does he know the way 
 Does he know the way 
 Of the crickets that would convince me to call it a night 
 I will never end up like him 
 Behind me back I already am 
 Keep a calendar this way you will always know 
 The last time you came through 
 Oh, Darling I know what you're going through 
 The last time you came through 
 Oh, Darling (3x) 
 Tempest in a tea cup, get unique 
 Peroxide Princess 
 Shine like shark teeth 
 It's a sign (5x) 
 What if you peaked early 
 Does your husband know the way 
 That the sun shine gleams from your wedding band 
 Does he know the way 
 Does he know the way 
 Of the crickets that would convince me to call it a night 
 Does he know the way to worship all night 
 Does your husband know the way 
 That the sun shine gleams from your wedding band 
 But I will never up end up like him 
 Behind my back I already am 
 Keep a calendar 
 This way you will always know 
 The last time you came through 
 Oh, Darling I know what you're going through 
 The last time you came through 
 Oh, Darling (3x) 
 Does your husband know? (3x) 
 Does he know? (3x) 
 But I will never up end up like him 
 Behind my back I already am 
 Keep a calendar 
 This way you will always know 
 The last time you came through 
 Oh, Darling I know what you're going through 
 The last time you came through 
 Oh, Darling I know what you're going through
