(I can feel it) 
 Music be flowing through my veins 
 (Oh I can feel it) 
 Music be flowing through my veins 
 The game change people, they don't love me the same 
 But music in my blood, I got love for the game (x2) 
 I've played the drugs scene, that's sold drugs to drug fiends 
 'Cause I love cream but music is in my blood stream 
 I'm heavy'O on the radio in the club scene 
 My fans don't understand what say no to drugs mean 
 Blood diamonds, bentley love like dove cream 
 I watch dirty money, but make sure the tub clean 
 Nigga my bars off the richter 
 Is the dude that rock a lotta jews like (Hitler) 
 If a nigga try stop me from getting richer 
 I spit them shots, and pop niggaz like ur sister 
 I clap it, me and the ratchett a bad mixture 
 When I hit ya your gonna need more than talinor lixor 
 I spit the chopper doc wont be able to fix ya, brother 
 Your mother, and all your babies will miss ya 
 I'm from philly, I ball but no I'm not a sixer 
 Barry not illegal either, I carry illegal heaters 
 You not about what you said you were 'bout, 
 My lifes a movie don't get edited out 
 And, you should watch who your wife let in the house 
 'Cause I ain't sleep with her but I slept with her mouth 
 I'm pathetic, hell-a-don, contastetics in her mouth 
 Skeet skeet, got onna dem teeth pregnant in her mouth 
 Niggaz complain 'bout the rap game 
 Cats in the game, ain't rapping the same, raps changed 
 They like Cas we need you to come back man 
 Raps so lame, you got that crack cocaine 
 My flow flames, caroesine and phutane, gasoline and propane 
 I ain't playin' no games 
 Back when I started to rap, I ain't had no change 
 I was committed with, stuck with it until the dough came 
 That's why I got love for this music 
 Not only did I write it I produced it 
 This Exclusive 
 Music be flowing through my veins 
 (I can feel it) 
 Music be flowing through my veins 
 The game change people don't love me the same 
 But music in my blood, I got love for the game (x3) 
 Music be flowing through my veins (x4)
