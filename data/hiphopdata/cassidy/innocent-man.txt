Did my time in a county jail just when 
 Just when things started goin' well 
 And I paid the price for the crimes I did 
 Wanna change my life, wanna raise my kids 
 I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man 
 Misunderstood, I'm misunderstood 
 I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man 
 Just from the hood, I'm just from the hood 
 I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man 
 Misunderstood, I'm misunderstood 
 I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man 
 Just from the hood but the man is good, understood? 
 I do the damn thing, bezel and the damn bling 
 Sling grams, spend 10 grand on a damn ring 
 I run Philly, I ain't tryin' to be the damn king 
 But the damn thing could get pulled like a hamstring 
 I used to hang with these niggas from my hood man 
 Yeah, I showed them the world, I took 'em out the hood man 
 Yeah, it cost some change but it's all good man 
 'Cause I got money to burn like backwoods man 
 And we was smokin', jokin' and poppin' bottles 
 Gettin' open, strokin', pokin' and poppin' models 
 I was hopin', that they could get paper with me 
 But when I started gettin' cake they started hatin' on me 
 They showed up to the crib that my mother was at 
 My son, my baby mother and my brother was at 
 And they was strapped, actin' tough and started bustin' they gat 
 To protect my family I started bustin' it back 
 I'm an innocent man 
 Misunderstood, I'm misunderstood 
 I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man 
 Just from the hood, I'm just from the hood 
 I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man 
 Misunderstood, I'm misunderstood 
 I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man 
 Just from the hood but the man is good, understood? 
 Jail vicious, it's hard to be patient and stay strong 
 When you get pictures of chicks half naked in they thongs 
 The anticipation be makin' the days long 
 I waited 'cause I just gotta make it like Trey Songz 
 My lawyers couldn't lose, they proved the D.A. wrong 
 I smiled at the trial, kept cool and stayed calm 
 I waved at my mom and swallowed my pride man 
 Them guys on the stand brought tears to my eyes man 
 The stuff they was discussin' was nothin' but lies man 
 They said I bust the chrome at homie that died man 
 I thought them lil' dudes was part of my squad man 
 'Til they started actin' up but they must've been high man 
 You see that I ain't shook from the look in my eyes man 
 But bein' booked was a blessin' in disguise man 
 I needed time to get my life organized man 
 So everythin' that happened was part of my God's plan, understand? 
 I'm an innocent man 
 Misunderstood, I'm misunderstood 
 I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man 
 Just from the hood, I'm just from the hood 
 I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man 
 Misunderstood, I'm misunderstood 
 I'm an innocent man, I'm a innocent man 
 Just from the hood but the man is good, understood? 
 Involuntary manslaughter, just parole 
 I spanked the murder like a bad ass 6 year old 
 I knew that I was gon' be rich since I was 6 years old 
 Now I'm the richest rapper under 26 years old 
 So it's on now, I'm home now, it's a celebration 
 I got my drink and my 2 step 'cause I'm elevatin' 
 I'm gettin' hella cake and with the number 1 record 
 But I'll still bust my gun if you come test it 
 Change the life that I, that I live 
 Got me livin' fine, livin' negative 
 Need to leave the game that is destroyin' me 
 So I pray to God that He has mercy 
 I'm an innocent man, I'm an innocent man 
 I'm an innocent man, I'm an innocent man 
 I'm an innocent man, I'm an innocent man 
 I'm an innocent man
