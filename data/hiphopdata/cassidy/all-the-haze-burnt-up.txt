I'm smokin' till 
 ALL the haze burnt up x8 
 Girl you know the hustler had to jump up on this track 
 Every track I jump on crack my fans got the monkey on they back 
 And I be poppin' bottles homie I be on that yeah 
 And I be poppin' model's hit the donkey from the back 
 And I be gettin' swallowed everynite after my shows 
 You would think I hit the lotto I be swaggin on these hoes 
 Cass be on his toes ima get cash till the casket close 
 And I been baggin hoes since a kid wit a nasty nose 
 I had nasty clothes since back in the day when rappers use to wear baggy clothes 
 I stay strapped in my ratchet hoes more shells then a bag of pistachios 
 My ratchet blows for snitches I have you sittin' in a box 
 I was sittin' in a kitchen whippin the pigeons in the pot 
 I be watchin everything and I be listenin alot 
 When I'm spittin' you be gettin' a description of the block 
 To start pitchin on the block you gotta get permission on the block 
 I school dudes then make 'em pay a tuition on the block 
 I got puss for sell if you sick I can fill yo prescription on the block 
 I got cake I be knockin' off weight like a dietition on the block 
 Get rid of pounds like a right sized smoothie use benjamins to wipe my booty 
 I'm wit a chick wit some nice sized boobies she love my raps so she love my movies 
 So she tronna seduce me she tronna give me some coochie 
 Dudes hate when she be showin cass love she get so wet we have sex in the bath tub 
 And yo I blow mad bud mad Kush mad sour I smoke alotta haze I always gotta blaze 
 And roll up a dutch every half hour 
 I'm smokin' till 
 ALL the haze burnt up x8
