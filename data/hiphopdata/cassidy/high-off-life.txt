Everyday everyday everyday everyday 
 Off the life 
 I get high 
 So high 
 That I can kiss the sky 
 Heads in the clouds 
 But I don't know why 
 But you can tell by the look in my eyes 
 Everyday everyday everyday everyday 
 Off the life 
 I get high 
 So high 
 That I can kiss the sky 
 Heads in the clouds 
 But I don't know why 
 But you can tell by the look in my eyes 
 You don't wanna party 
 When you're around me 
 I'm a drug dealer 
 And a killer like ... 
 I can't go upstate 
 I do time in a county 
 But the federal police surrounds me 
 I'm driving my JT Bentley 
 Put your baby mama ... Monica Lewensky 
 She've seen a president she'd jump in their ... 
 ... You can see she's on my dick evidently 
 She said oh no I'm not a hore but you can ... me 
 I'm like ... baby father ... like a century 
 He'd be drawing me like Leonardo DaVinci 
 I always drink until my glass's empty 
 Smoke too much weed that I got a bad memory 
 It's a lot of jealousy and envy 
 But it's all good 
 I got the neighborhood and my friends 
 You don't wanna test me 
 You can get snipe like ... 
 Shuts pop like Pepsi 
 You better respect me 
 I'll kick your ass like ... 
 Put you on ice like ... 
 Turn you into a ghost like ... 
 None of you folks gonna impress me 
 ... But it's sexy 
 Email attacks me 
 Call on my phone 
 They try to catch me 
 They blow me like dizzy 
 ... 
 They're addicted to my dick 
 So all the chicks stress me like 
 I'm vitamin acid
