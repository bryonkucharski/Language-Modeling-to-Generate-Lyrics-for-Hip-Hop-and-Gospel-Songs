To all my ladies think it's about time, 'cause there's just one thing that's on my mind 
 Your body, your body 
 To all my ladies looking so fine, there's just one thing that's on my mind 
 Your body, your body, I want you girl 
 Fresh I am, yes I am 
 Skinny jeans on, I wear them 
 I'm such a little kid get my high chair then 
 But look at my watch and what's under my chin 
 So icy, your girl like me 
 True blood but I told her don't bite me 
 Forget the club let me see what you liking 
 She said she wanna just do it like Nike 
 Well okay let me put it down, I turn into a freak when nobody's around 
 When you under the sheets I know what's going down, down, down 
 Yeah, and she'll want to leave me though she keep coming back, it must be the Louis bags and them hundred stacks 
 Or I make her cum fast like she running track, Magnum, Jimmy hat 
 To all my ladies think it's about time, 'cause there's just one thing that's on my mind 
 Your body, your body 
 To all my ladies looking so fine, there's just one thing that's on my mind 
 Your body, your body, I want you girl 
 B-R-E-E-Z-Y 
 Hell of a guy, I'm fly, higher than high, Dubai I go 
 Private jets, nevertheless I travel the globe 
 I'm ready to go but first let me call my PO 
 Aha, baby take my hand in 
 And we can do anything except land in 
 Love it when you give it to me speak it in Spanish 
 This week black girl, next week a Hispanic 
 Can't forget the white girls, that's right girls 
 Yeah the white girls 
 Hollywood price right bright light girls 
 And them hood hella drunk all night girls, that's what I like yeah 
 Oh you like cars? I got hot wheels 
 Haters mad, huh wonder how them cops feel 
 So let me cop a feel, aha right there 
 And we can disappear David Copperfield 
 To all my ladies think it's about time, 'cause there's just one thing that's on my mind 
 Your body, your body 
 To all my ladies looking so fine, there's just one thing that's on my mind 
 Your body, your body, I want you girl
