When you showing me all the ways to love 
 Damn it drives me crazy I can't get enough 
 So many befor never really sure but you showed me baby 
 What it really mean to give your heart to someone 
 Can't even lie that was something I've never done 
 Until you came along and made me better I don't have to look farther girl 
 Yes it true 
 I don't never need nothing if I got you 
 Just want to give me love (give it all to you) 
 Ill tell you this I promise I know you love it when 
 I promise I promise I promise i 
 I know you love it when 
 I promise I promise I promise I sex love 
 (Chris Brown) 
 Imma be your heart 
 You can read my mind 
 I don't understand it but I let it slide 
 Anything you want baby ill do it 
 I know what real love is and girl we gonna make some 
 I know that I'm gonna be that body leaving you wanting more 
 I'm sure 
 Girl don't worry we don't have to hurry and ill never go no where 
 What it really mean to give your heart to someone 
 Can't even lie that was something I've never done 
 Until you came along and made me better I don't have to look farther girl 
 Yes it true 
 I don't never need nothing if I got you 
 Just want to give me love (give it all to you) 
 Ill tell you this I promise I know you love it when 
 I promise I promise I promise i 
 I know you love it when 
 I promise I promise I promise I sex love 
 (Seven) 
 Finally found someone who appercites what I do 
 So many other miss out on love and they don't have a clue 
 Unbleive you wanted me 
 And I know I'm Sane right here laying with you (oh with you) 
 (Half of the Chorus) 
 I don't never need nothing if I got you 
 Just want to give me love (give it all to you) 
 Ill tell you this I promise I know you love it when 
 I promise I promise I promise i 
 I know you love it when 
 I promise I promise I promise I sex love
