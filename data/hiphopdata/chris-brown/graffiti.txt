I see you writin' on my wall, why you wanna do that (do that) 
 My name is tagged, you already see that (see that) 
 The media wanna paint it all black, and they do it right in my face 
 See I can't sit back, and let it all wash away (wash away) 
 I worked too hard, for it to be erased 
 Before you talk, Imma finish what I gotta say 
 Cause already put in time, with all of my grindin', all of my grindin' 
 You know I grind 
 Through all of this struggle, all of this struggle 
 Even though the pain, I still gon' have to hustle 
 Man, I had to feed my family, and at the same time keep my sanity 
 Oh no 
 Man I can't let you do it 
 Graffiti you tryna spray (spray) 
 Spray on me (me), graffiti you tryna spray (spray), 
 On my name (name) 
 Graffiti you tryna spray (spray), spray on me (me) 
 All the graffiti you tryna spray (spray), 
 On my name (name) 
 But it's already writtin on the wall 
 Can't cover it up, can't cover it up 
 But it's already written on the wall 
 Can't cover it up, can't cover it up 
 Who got award shows rockin' every time I hit the stage (time I hit the stage) 
 Even the haters went and bought a CD 
 But now my fans I'm an empty spray can 
 And I just can't paint a thing 
 Seem like the less I have the money, the less I have the problems 
 The more I got the money, the more I got the problems (hello) 
 Let me clear my throat, gotta make sure you hear me go 
 Cause already put in time, with all of my grindin', all of my grindin' 
 You know I grind 
 All of this struggle, all of this struggle 
 Even though the pain I still gon' have to hustle 
 Man I had to feed my family (ly), and at the same time keep my sanity 
 Oh no 
 Man I can't let you do it 
 Graffiti you tryna spray (spray) 
 Spray on me (me), graffiti you tryna spray (spray), 
 On my name (name) (on my name, on my name, on my name) 
 Graffiti you tryna spray (spray), spray on me (me) 
 All the graffiti you tryna spray (spray), 
 On my name (name) 
 'Cause it's already writtin on the wall 
 Can't cover it up, can't cover it up 
 'Cause it's already written on the wall 
 Can't cover it up, can't cover it up baby 
 Its already done ain't gonna paint no more 
 With all this pain that I've endured 
 I know, I was wrong for what I did 
 And I made some mistakes 'cause I'm human 
 I ain't gon feed into the negative 
 Imma keep grindin, oh yeah 
 On this graffiti, oh, oh, oh 
 Cause already put in time, with all of my grindin', all of my grindin' 
 You know I grind through 
 All of this struggle, all of this struggle 
 Even though the pain I still have to hustle 
 Man I had to feed my family, and at the same time keep my sanity Oh no 
 Man I can't let you do it, 
 Graffiti you tryna spray (spray) 
 Spray on me (me), graffiti you tryna spray (spray), 
 On my name (name) 
 Graffiti you tryna spray (spray), spray on me (me) 
 All the graffiti you tryna spray (spray), on my day (day) 
 Can't cover it up, can't cover it up 
 Can't cover it up can't cover it up
