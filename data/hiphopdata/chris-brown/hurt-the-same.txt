Sick and tired of the bullshit, you won't get another chance 
 Fucking lame niggas, I don't really understand 
 'Cause you know I'ma cash out, fuck the rubberbands 
 I bought you everything, peanut butter Benz 
 You was s'posed to be there when I got out of jail 
 But you'd rather hoe out with all of your friends 
 Going crazy, did my time, you ain't send me mail 
 Take it as I was tryna make you win, ain't had no bail 
 You supposed to be down for your nigga 
 Baby, we would, baby, who you with? Girl, you sipping 
 I was supposed to have your heart 
 But you just kept me in the dark painting pictures 
 I know you lying and you sneaking, I'm just stating facts 
 I'm just that dummy who believed you 'cause I loved your ass 
 Not the only nigga who been through that 
 But I'm the only nigga with receipts and popping tags 
 I was looking forward to us making love 
 And waking up for round two 
 But you ain't stayed long enough, it's fucking me up 
 Learning from them hoes that's around you 
 And now you up on games, no 
 You don't see me the same, no 
 The drugs, they can numb the pain 
 Popping bars, it's easy but, but I still hurt the same 
 Thinking 'bout these bitches when I'm rolling up 
 I'm just tryna vibe, wanna feel the love, two bitches like double dutch 
 Off that purple Actavis, I stay with that double cup 
 I just switched my style up, now she stuck like what the fuck 
 Started not to care, European real, bought a couple foreigns 
 Driving outta here, know that molly get me there 
 Just a couple sips, just 'fore I forget, don't remember shit 
 Get a lot of pussy, don't fuck with relationships 
 I'm on my mind now, on that crazy shit 
 On my brazy shit, don't wanna know who she be fucking with 
 She tryna break my heart, I know you loving it 
 You on some other shit and I'm on my own again 
 I was looking forward to us making love 
 And waking up for round two 
 But you ain't stayed long enough, it's fucking me up 
 Learning from them hoes that's around you 
 And now you up on games, no 
 You don't see me the same, no 
 The drugs, they can numb the pain 
 Popping bars, it's easy but, but I still hurt the same 
 I try to think away and navigate 
 But you steady throwing shade on my name 
 While I'm taking all the blame 
 We both messed up and going separate ways 
 You fuckin' them niggas, I'm fuckin' them bitches 
 All that silly shit won't make a difference 
 Know what it is, I'm the man in my city 
 He only look at your ass and them titties 
 You don't need makeup, you know that you pretty 
 You kinda crazy, you know that I get it 
 Half on a baby, you know that I did it 
 Guilty as charged, I ain't gonna be innocent 
 I'm tryna be limitless 
 I'm tryna fuck up all the Hennessy 
 You know I say fuck all my enemies 
 I know you on your independent shit 
 Quality over quantity 
 Bad bitch right in front of me 
 Can't lie, baby, honestly 
 'Cause that pussy remindin' me 
 And now you up on games, no 
 You don't see me the same, no 
 The drugs, they can numb the pain 
 Popping bars, it's easy but, but I still hurt the same 
 Up on games 
 You don't see me the same, no 
 Numb the pain, yeah 
 Bars, it's easy but, but I still hurt the same
