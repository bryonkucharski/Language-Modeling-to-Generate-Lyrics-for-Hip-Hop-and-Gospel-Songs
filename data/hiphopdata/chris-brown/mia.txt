What are you thinking? 
 I know you see 
 Your cell phone blinking 
 Backwards 
 And forward I'm pacing 
 Trying to figure out 
 Why you ain't calling me back 
 What does it all mean? 
 Maybe you're trying 
 To show me something 
 But you ain't 
 Gotta do it this way, no 
 Put yourself in my shoes 
 Tell me what would you do 
 She knows 
 I've been hitting her 
 On the phone 
 And I know 
 She's been gettin' it 
 Something's wrong 
 Could it be 
 That she's with the other dude 
 From her past 
 I know damn well that she ain't 
 Sittin' there laughin' 
 With her girlfriends 
 Lookin' at the number 
 Talking 'bout it's him again 
 I know 
 She better call pretty soon 
 I'm gonna send the boys 
 To find out 
 Just why she's been M.I.A 
 Is it a problem? 
 And if its really one 
 I'ma solve it 
 Don't know how 
 You handled other dudes 
 But I'm not them 
 Girl you runnin' around 
 Got 'em thinkin' 
 That I can't handle my thang 
 Ooh, are you crazy? 
 Did you really think you could play me? 
 I'm bout to show up on your doorstep 
 And you better answer when I knock 
 Knock, you better be by yourself 
 She knows 
 I've been hitting 
 Her on the phone 
 And I know 
 She's been gettin' it 
 Something's wrong 
 Could it be 
 That she's with the other dude 
 From her past 
 I know damn well that she ain't 
 Sittin' there laughin' 
 With her girlfriends 
 Lookin' at the number 
 Talking 'bout it's him again 
 I know she better call pretty soon 
 I'm gonna send the boys to find out 
 Just why she's been M.I.A 
 You can't run 
 (Cause the boys are gonna find ya, girl) 
 You can't hide 
 (Cause you know I'm right behind ya, girl) 
 If you tellin' the truth 
 Then why you actin' like you scared? 
 Over there 
 You can't run 
 (Cause them boys are gonna find ya, ooh) 
 You can't hide 
 (Cause you know I'm right behind ya, ooh) 
 If what you say is true 
 Then why you can't comin' back baby 
 Baby 
 She knows 
 I've been hitting 
 Her on the phone 
 And I know 
 She's been gettin' it 
 Something's wrong 
 Could it be that she's 
 With the other dude 
 From her past 
 I know damn well that she ain't 
 Sittin' there laughin' 
 With her girlfriends 
 Lookin' at the number 
 Talking 'bout it's him again
