 Chris Brown: 
 The name you know of 
 A little bit change now your boy done blown up 
 And I'm doing things that gets exposed 
 Stunting ain't a thing to me 
 And it's obvious it's plain to see 
 That you gone make us both 
 Get into some things

 Shi* they might even say 
 You should leave me alone 
 Don't be scared 
 You need to get like me 
 Stunting is a habit 
 Just gotta have it 
 Shawty can throw anything at me 
 I'm gonna bag it 
 When she sees the carrots 
 They real just like a rabbit 
 Can't no other boy 
 Do the things you like 
 He ain't your type 
 Change your life 
 But if you did your homework

 Drop top singing know Jones and Banner gonna roll

 Jim Jones: 
 They told me stuntin' was an artform (like Da Vinci) 
 Winter time no top but the car on (Lambourgini) 
 We don't park we leave the car on 
 The bad bitches gimme hard on

 My garage like horses in the stable (horsees) 
 Cars all pretty 
 Hard or more drippy like the Frankie better 
 It's banks stopped all betters 
 It's tank top in good weather 
 My niggas all wit it 
 Treat out whips like our bitches 
 We take the top off 
 And then we jump off in they guts 
 Just like we jump up in the sluts 
 They say we smoke good 
 Puff ferraris up in dope hoods 
 Because we so hood it's all good 
 Say stuntin' is a habit, so put it in the air
