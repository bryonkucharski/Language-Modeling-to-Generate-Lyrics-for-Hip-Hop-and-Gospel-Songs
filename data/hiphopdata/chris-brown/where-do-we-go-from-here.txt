 Me the skyss the limit, (the sky's the limit) 
 When there's footprints on the moon,(the moon) 
 I don't need a TV show to dance 
 With the stars. 
 Not me, I'm good (I'm good) 
 Half of the world don't lie, 
 (Don't lie) 
 Half of the world wanna be, 
 (Wanna be) 
 But people deny that pretty 
 Little thing they call Earth, 
 Needs me. 
 But the rest of the world 
 Wanna dance and make 
 Something from nothing, 
 Yeah, but so? (so?) 
 The rest of the world wanna 
 Either do good business, 
 Have glue without flow, 
 I'm here to show the world 
 That money don't buy happiness, 
 Believe me, I know.(I know) 
 But just one thing, 
 Wanna show the world, 
 I just wanna know.

 AKA Mr.Worldwide. 
 Don't be silly, 
 I've had it on longer, that's fo'sho 
 And I've already changed my city, 
 Now I'm on my way to change the globe, (globe) 
 I'm trying to inspire the world to show 
 What you did when you hustle in your work, 
 Show 'em what it is, 
 To put your life on the line 
 For the love of the grind, 
 Life is a rhyme with no reason, 
 And that's the rason I rhyme, 
 But once I show the globe, 
 I just wanna know.
