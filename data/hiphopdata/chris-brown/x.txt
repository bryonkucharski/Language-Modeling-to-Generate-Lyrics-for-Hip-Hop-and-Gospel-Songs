If you're only as good as the company you keep 
 Then I'mma blame you for what they say about me 
 (Free your mind, and let your conscience be free) 
 When I was by myself I was fast asleep 
 Since you came around I've been up for weeks 
 (Free your mind, and let your conscience be free) 
 Yi-yi-yikes I've been with the wrong crowd 
 I can make you a believer, if I turn the nonsense down 
 I keep my secrets in a safehouse, better if I don't speak 
 Devil's tryna tempt me, they just outline my shape out 
 Place me at the crime scene 
 I can see from this high up, you ain't got a heart girl 
 Privacy is for the cheater obviously you're deceiving 
 I know 
 I know just who you are 
 You put me on lay away 
 You just love to heart shop 
 I think that it's over 
 I think that it's over 
 I swear to god I'm moving on 
 I ain't go back no more, I ain't go back no more 
 I ain't go back no more, I ain't go back no more 
 (I ain't tripping of you you you you) 
 I ain't go back no more, I ain't go back no more 
 (I ain't tripping of you you you) 
 I ain't go back no more, I ain't go back no more 
 You just start a fight, I ain't fighting back I'm cool with it 
 I, simply came here to party 
 Why, would I trip off that bullshit, when I'm on that good shit 
 I swear to god I'm moving on 
 Substitute love for a better thing 
 I deal with my pain like a lonely child 
 I didn't build these walls for you to piss all on my past oh 
 Go ahead burn it down, I'mma build me another one 
 All these clouds... 
 I know 
 I know just who you are 
 You put me on lay away 
 You just love to heart shop 
 I think that it's over 
 I think that it's over 
 I swear to god I'm moving on 
 I ain't go back no more, I ain't go back no more 
 I ain't go back no more, I ain't go back no more 
 (I ain't tripping of you you you you) 
 I ain't go back no more, I ain't go back no more 
 (I ain't tripping of you you you) 
 I ain't go back no more, I ain't go back no more 
 You just start a fight, I ain't fighting back I'm cool with it 
 I, simply came here to party 
 Why, would I trip off that bullshit, when I'm on that good shit 
 I swear to god I'm moving on
