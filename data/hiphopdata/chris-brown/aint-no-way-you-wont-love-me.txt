Ay, can I talk to you for a minute? 
 You new around here? 
 Girl ain't no way, I won't let you down. 
 If you let me I will show you how, (I like what I see). 
 Ain't no way (ain't no way), 
 I'm gone let you down (let you down). 
 I know it's hard right now (hard right now), 
 To see (it's in me). 
 But I'm gone make you say you love me. 
 The way (girl the way), you look to me now (to me now). 
 We need to get down (let's get down), 
 You gone know what. 
 'Cause I'm gone you say you love me girl. 
 I ain't never fell for a girl like you (like you). 
 With jeans and a body that curves like you (like you). 
 I don't really care what they say, when it comes to a difference of age. 
 I can show you all the things I'll do. 
 Break your heart, never raise my voice. 
 Girl let down your guard. 
 I know it's alot to ask trust in me, but I can make a difference right now you'll see. 
 Shorty tell me why you tryna keep all the goodies from me? 
 Can't you see what you holding me, that does to me. 
 Everytime you walk pass, 
 Oh. 
 (Chorus: Repeat 1x) 
 For a minute can you just think about us two? 
 Swervin in my 645 SU, me leanin over the seat. 
 I'm passin you your own set of keys, showin you just how the teen got you. 
 Trust and believe these words, from me been said before. 
 Trickin ain't my M-O.But girl you represent everything, 
 That Chris is about so shawty please. 
 Shawty tell me why you tryna keep all the goodies from me? 
 Can't you see what you holding me, that does to me. 
 Everytime you walk pass, oh. 
 (Chorus: Repeat 1x) 
 For you girl, I'll buy you anything, 
 Just to have you close to me. 
 Cause you know ya lovin' is off the wall. 
 Can't nothin' come about, we'll take it slow. 
 I ain't like the ones' ya know. 
 I'm gonna make ya love me all night long. 
 (Chorus: Repeat 1x) 
 (Music fades out...)
