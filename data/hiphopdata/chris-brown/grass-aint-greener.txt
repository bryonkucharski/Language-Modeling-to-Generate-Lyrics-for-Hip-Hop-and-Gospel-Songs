You ain't the girl that you used to be 
 You say you're done, you're moving on 
 This ain't the world that it used to be 
 Looks like you've won, looks like you've won 
 Sick of leaving messages on your cell 
 A true lover, but when I'm not there 
 Girl, you had somebody that really cared 
 How you fuck it up, girl, it's not fair 
 You used to be the one to talk to on the side 
 Waiting for my love to break up 
 It's crazy how your ass can walk through every night 
 Acting like you been a player 
 That grass ain't greener on the other side 
 Oh, yeah 
 That grass ain't greener on the other side 
 Oh, yeah 
 Seems like ain't nothing cool about being real 
 No one's honest about what they feel 
 Take a hoe and try to treat her well 
 She'll be back up at the club again 
 I know what you want, but you're not gon' get it 
 'Less I know for sure that you're vibing with me 
 You do what you want with somebody else 
 I'm gone, baby 
 You used to be the one to talk to on the side 
 Waiting for my love to break up 
 It's crazy how your ass can walk through every night 
 Acting like you been a player 
 That grass ain't greener on the other side, I've been there 
 Oh yeah, I've been there 
 That grass ain't greener on the other side 
 Oh yeah 
 My homie said I need to stop it 
 My momma said bitches be watchin' you 
 They gon' put their hand all in your pocket 
 For the credit card that's in your wallet 
 Drinkin' liquor when we celebratin' 
 Calculatin' all my funds 
 Tryna get a nigga take the condom off 
 'Cause she want that tax every month, woo 
 I know what you want, but you're not gon' get it 
 Take my kindness for weakness when you act sadity 
 Keeping it 100 ain't your forté 
 You used to be 
 You used to be the one to talk to on the side 
 Waiting for my love to break up 
 It's crazy how your ass can walk through every night 
 Acting like you been a player 
 That grass ain't greener on the other side 
 Oh yeah 
 That grass ain't greener on the other side 
 Oh yeah
