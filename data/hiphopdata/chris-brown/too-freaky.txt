Lyrics: 
 I got that long money, 
 So is my dick, 
 Change my pamper homie 'cause I'm on that new shit, 
 My chains too big, 
 150 stacks, 
 And the yacht lookin' something like a crew ship, 
 I got that long money, 
 So is my dick, 
 Change my pamper homie 'cause I'm on that new shit, 
 I got that long money, 
 So is my dick, 
 Change my pamper homie 'cause I'm on that new shit, 
 My chains too big, 
 150 stacks, 
 And the yacht lookin' something like a crew ship, 
 Roll with me, 
 We could float away, 
 And we can hop in the jaccuzzi filled with Rosé 
 All that extra space, 
 Yeah it cost a grip 
 Stuntin on shawty, she a bad chick 
 I will take you down if you lemme do it, 
 Girl you can get all of me if you lemme do it, 
 Shawty when I do my thang, I ain't gon stop 
 Wanna hear my name when you on top, 
 'Cause you know I'm too freaky, too freaky, too freaky, 
 Girl I wanna work lemme do my job, 
 Call me Bang Bang 'cause I go so hard, 
 Girl you know I'm too freaky, too freaky, too freaky 
 Wait babe, won't you come over and play babe, 
 Bet you I can make that nanana scene, 
 Have you in the kitchen licking your plate clean, 
 All up on the counter, 
 Lady, have you had it good lately, 
 Imma give you what you need, right now 
 I will take you down if you lemme do it, 
 Girl you can get all of me if you lemme do it, 
 Shawty when I do my thang, I ain't gon stop 
 Wanna hear my name when you on top, 
 'Cause you know I'm too freaky, too freaky, too freaky, 
 Girl I wanna work lemme do my job, 
 Call me Bang Bang 'cause I go so hard, 
 Girl you know I'm too freaky, too freaky, too freaky 
 Shawty when I do my thang, I ain't gon stop 
 Wanna hear my name when you on top, 
 'Cause you know I'm too freaky, too freaky, too freaky, 
 Girl I wanna work lemme do my job, 
 Call me Bang Bang 'cause I go so hard, 
 Girl you know I'm too freaky, too freaky, too freaky
