I remember back in high school 
 Always been that nigga, been the nigga with the nice moves, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Never hung with the nice dudes 
 Hung out with them niggas, robbing niggas for they shoes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 All my niggas went to night school, dumb as fuck 
 Whippin' in the kitchen like a chemist, gettin' they money up 
 10, 20s, 50s and them 100s, yeah, yeah 
 I think I'm good for the summer, yeah, yeah 
 I just wanna let the top down and just ride 
 Feeling good, tryna live my life 
 I've been grindin' all year 
 Got the hammer right here, if a nigga try 
 I'm so for real, this time 
 Let your candy rain on me, babe 
 Don't fuck it up it's on me, babe 
 If you fuck it up it's all on me, babe 
 And let's slip and let's slide, oh yeah 
 And if we sip, we can't drive (yeah) 
 So you gon' have to stay over (yeah) 
 And wait out this hangover (yeah, yeah) 
 Wait out this hangover 
 Don't be embarrassed 
 And don't be scared to show that thing 
 I love what you wearing, don't know who made it 
 PYT, you that pretty young thing 
 Girl, I ain't no Casanova 
 But I'ma give you everything you want 
 But you just can't be 
 Another baby mama blowing up my phone, no, no 
 Baby girl, don't you do that, don't be nosy (no) 
 Don't be lookin' through my phone, lookin' for them hoes 'cause you know me (no) 
 Don't be acting boujee in the coach seats (woo) 
 Don't be a hater, throwin' them stones from the nose bleeds (what?) 
 You gotta live life, do it, do it (do it, do it) 
 Go and get a cheque, do it, do it (do it, do it) 
 All this hate I'm getting used to it (yeah, yeah) 
 We the leaders of the new school, it ain't shit that I can't do 
 I'm so for real, this time 
 Let your candy rain on me, babe (baby) 
 Don't fuck it up it's on me, babe (me, baby) 
 If you fuck it up it's all on me, babe (me, baby) 
 And let's slip and let's slide, oh yeah 
 And if we sip, we can't drive (yeah) 
 So you gon' have to stay over (yeah) 
 And wait out this hangover (yeah, yeah) 
 Wait out this hangover 
 You gotta stay over, oh wee, oh 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, don't leave (no) 
 'Cause it's a party after the party, you gon' see 
 She told me she ain't never fuck a nigga like me 
 I hit her from the back, pull up with the stick 
 Now she on the dick, pull out all her tracks 
 Cameras takin' pics, shit we lit 
 I'm so for real, this time 
 Let your candy rain on me, babe (on me, baby) 
 Don't fuck it up it's on me, babe (me, baby) 
 If you fuck it up it's all on me, babe (all on me, baby) 
 Baby, and let's slip and let's slide, oh yeah 
 And if we sip, we can't drive (yeah) 
 So you gon' have to stay over (yeah) 
 And wait out this hangover (yeah, yeah) 
 Wait out this hangover (ooh)
