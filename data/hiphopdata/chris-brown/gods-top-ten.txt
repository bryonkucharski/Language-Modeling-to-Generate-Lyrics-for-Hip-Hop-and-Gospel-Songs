Romance is gone, he's drifting with the stars 
 The lyric in his pocket, little girl in his heart 
 When you hear his songs on the radio I don't need to tell you what you already know 
 He's in God's top ten where heaven never ends 
 You saw the world and the world saw you on the stage 
 Wild, wild, wild, Colonial Boy 
 Roquefort le Pont 
 Your gypsy heart is free, pictures on the wall of your family 
 He's on God's top ten where heaven never ends 
 He's on God's top ten 
 Baby's got mama's eyes, she was always beautiful 
 When you hear his voice, feel his arms around you 
 You remember mama's smile and daddy's little girl 
 Bad weather, cold media storm 
 He's on God's top ten where heaven never ends 
 He's on God's top ten
