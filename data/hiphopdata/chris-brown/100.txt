Beats I be serving sex beefs... 
 Diamonds got so many cuts call my jeweler to surgeon 
 Ain't nobody fucking with me label me the virgin 
 I'm hot burning, like when you leave a perm in 
 Everywhere I go these hoes be digging in they purses for a shark 
 Because they tryin' get the autograph of person 
 Little bit of coke mix with a lot of bourbon 
 Got your boy leaning sorry if my words slurin 
 Swervin' in that DV9 on purpose 
 The roof disappear call it magic like Earvin Johnson 
 Get above my Johnson, know my rider dick Shawty this ain't magic mountain 
 I've been killing, killing every song that I been spitting on 
 And if I ain't spitting, better something that I written on 
 Can't even say it was a long road getting on 
 Only took a year and a half and now I'm shitting on 
 Get it how I live it, come faster than I could spend it 
 Money to the ceiling, bitch I'm in the building 
 I'm a giant in the woods to the minks (tell her) 
 Money talk so don't say nothing unless you talk business 
 A 100% (I go), A 100% (I go) 
 A 100% (I go), A 100% (I go) 
 A 100% (I go), A 100% (I go) 
 A 100% (I go), A 100% (I go) 
 I go 
 Let me count this money, 1 million, 2 million 
 Put this up for my new car, save that for my baby mama 
 And all you bums keep the change 
 Yeah, I got them bulletproof Ray-Bans so haters never in my head 
 Money hungry good for me, yeah I call it week bread 
 Ladies say I'm long show king yeah that's what she said 
 Crib like a castle so I'm fucking on that king spread 
 Haha 
 Big balling, fuck a loaf, and money turn me on 
 So I had to fuck it off, skinny ass niggers pockets looking so bulimic 
 And I'm never spill my drink, you can call me Tempur-Pedic 
 Allergic to the haters, addicted to the money 
 You watching while I'm laughing 'cause all of you niggers is funny 
 And they call me Action Jackson 'cause every day I'm stunting 
 And I'm writing hit songs like it's nothing 
 So nigger you bugging, fronting 
 What you think this is hoe? 
 Paparazzi trying to pop me everywhere that Chris go 
 Never been no sucker no lame mad nigger 
 And your flow is what a dam then a drain ass nigger 
 Get it how I live it, come faster than I could spend it 
 Money to the ceiling, bitch I'm in the building 
 I'm a giant in the woods to the minks (tell her) 
 Money talk so don't say nothing unless you talk business 
 A 100% (I go), A 100% (I go) 
 A 100% (I go), A 100% (I go) 
 A 100% (I go), A 100% (I go) 
 A 100% (I go), A 100% (I go) 
 I go
