Your place mid-night 
 When I come through 
 I ring ya doorbell twice 
 When I come through 
 I do the things you like like 
 Like I'm room service 
 And don't you take me 
 But every chick 
 Tryna take all your shit 
 'Cause I ain't even tryna 
 Get none of yo shit 
 Please I don't want none 
 Of your shit 
 Don't be start struck 
 When we go on under these covers 
 You can have have a bit 
 Of my hand cuffs 
 Man a boy just playin' along 
 I'll give it to you proper 
 Play nurse and you play doctor 
 Boy you know I got ya (hah) 
 I know what you like 
 You like the way I shine 
 I'm 10 times parta a dime 
 My golden girl 
 My golden girl 
 I've got my shit together 
 Even with a chick get a grip 
 With hips like this 
 My golden girl

 Freeze, 
 You ain't ever had a girl like me 
 If you think 
 That I'm lying test me, you'll see 
 That I'm good on that anger please

 You've been given none of my love to you 
 So don't be start struck 
 Don't be start struck 
 When we go on under these covers
