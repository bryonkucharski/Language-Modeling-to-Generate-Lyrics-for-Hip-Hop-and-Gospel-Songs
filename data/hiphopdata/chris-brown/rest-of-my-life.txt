Baby, love is gettin' cold, hold me 
 My heads down, soak sheet, many tears 
 Might have to go away tonight, 
 'Cause I gotta feelin' my days are numbered 
 This might be the day 
 I close my eyes for eternal sleep 
 No more wakin' up to Sunday morning now 
 Live to learn, learned a lot 
 Tonight I'm clocking out 
 This is my last kiss 
 My last wish 
 My last chance 
 My last dance 
 My last gift to give you 
 My love 
 It's the last time I'm holding you 
 Rest of my life with you tonight 
 Spendin rest of my life with you tonight 
 Spendin rest of my life with you tonight 
 Spendin rest of my life with you 
 My life with you 
 Chris Brown: 
 The walls are closin in yeah 
 Wonderin when I see you again 
 In your eye, you wonder why 
 So this time I won't be right back 
 But I'll be your shining star 
 A memory in your arms
