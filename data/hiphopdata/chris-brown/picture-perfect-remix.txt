 Low key

 Bright lights lookin' to flash like it's the police 
 She just put her drink on my pollo fleece 
 Speedin

 Came to the party with a bunch of orgies 
 Ladys wearin crown holders and a bunch on Coogi 
 Now they lookin' and the fellas know what I got 
 Can't nobody get her but me 
 Fliest thing in this spot 
 Prettiest thing that you ever seen 
 Hold up, wait, stop 
 Wanna take her picture, you ain't gonna get it for free 
 You got what it takes to get down 
 Lil mama way she work she breakin it to the ground 
 Strokin around her body hypnotics to the sound 
 Can nobody get her but me 
 Can't nobody get her but me
