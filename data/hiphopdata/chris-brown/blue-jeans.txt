This could be easy darling 
 You can be freaky, I'll be bad 
 This could be easy darling 
 If we just let go, know what we meant to do 
 Girl your bright green eyes and your pretty smile got me in the moment 
 I got your red lipstick all on my neck cause that what you wanting 
 Baby you're gold, you're all I want, silver chains make me belong 
 My mind is racing, two words, one thought 
 Take your high heels off, let's dance some more 
 Never felt like this before 
 I can feel it burn inside my head 
 Can't stop thinking 'bout how I'm gon' take your blue jeans off 
 This could be easy darling 
 You can be mommy, I'll be dad, ooh 
 This could be easy darling 
 If we just let go, girl I'm in love with you 
 Girl your bright green eyes and your pretty smile got me in the moment 
 I got your red lipstick all on my neck cause that what you wanting 
 Baby you're gold, you're all I want, silver chains make me belong 
 My mind is racing, two words, one thought 
 Take your high heels off, let's dance some more 
 Never felt like this before 
 I can feel it burn inside my head 
 Can't stop thinking 'bout how I'm gon' take your blue jeans off, take your blue jeans off 
 Take your blue jeans off 
 Take your blue jeans off 
 Take your blue jeans off 
 Take your blue jeans off 
 Girl your bright green eyes and your pretty smile got me in the moment 
 I got your red lipstick all on my neck cause that what you wanting 
 Baby you're gold, you're all I want, silver chains make me belong 
 Can't stop thinking 'bout how I'm gon' take your blue jeans off, take your blue jeans off 
 Take your blue jeans off 
 Take your blue jeans off 
 Take your blue jeans off
