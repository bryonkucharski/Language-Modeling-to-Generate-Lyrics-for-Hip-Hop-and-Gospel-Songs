Baby I don't like to say goodbye 
 So this is bye until next time, 
 I, I see you 
 Because I don't want to leave you (ooh) 
 I'll just kiss you one last time 
 To leave an imprint on your mind, 
 Girl - just for right now 
 Until we can hold out, 
 Remember, girl we can be miles apart, 
 And no matter where you are 
 You're always in my heart (heart) 
 Baby don't leave 
 Baby just stay right here, 
 Because I ain't going to waste your time 
 So you don't have to leave my sight, 
 You got me hoping 
 Don't leave 
 Baby just stay right here 
 Even if the world goes by 
 Still remember one last time 
 Together 
 I could cry a thousand tears, 
 But that wont keep you here 
 You said you were finished with this love, 
 So I said why are you giving up on us (on us) 
 I'll love you forever I promise, 
 But to me forever ain't that long 
 So baby don't you go, 
 Girl remember (remember) 
 Girl we can be miles apart, 
 And no matter where you are 
 You're always in my heart (my heart) 
 Baby don't leave, 
 Baby just stay right here (stay right here) 
 Because I ain't going to waste your time (no) 
 So you don't have to leave my sight, 
 You got me hoping (yeah) 
 Don't leave 
 Baby just stay right here (oh yeah) 
 Even if the world goes by (by) 
 Still remember one last time 
 Together
