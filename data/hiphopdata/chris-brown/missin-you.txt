(Verse 1: Chris Brown) 
 Layin here 
 All out of ideas 
 Ain't picked up the phone 
 In so damn long 
 I got the lights off 
 And I ain't sleep 'bout a week 
 You got a man in defeat 
 And that's the picture of me 
 The last time we spoke 
 I said goodbye 
 You had this look on your face 
 So many tears in your eyes 
 And I tried 
 To say it was for the best 
 But now I regret my choice 
 (Bridge: Jhonta Austin) 
 And if I had it to do all over 
 I would find me another way 
 To express what's on my mind 
 And try to find me the words I wanna say 
 And now I'm to hurt to love another 
 But I'm too proud to ask you back 
 I don't know if you'll ever get to hear this song 
 But I needed to tell you that 
 When I 
 When I first let you go I ain't know that it would hurt 
 But I miss you 
 I ain't never had it bad 
 But each day is gettin' worse 'cause I miss you 
 Baby 
 Sorry 
 The things I said and the things I did 
 If you want to hurry home 'cause I'm sittin' here alone 
 'Cause I miss you 
 (Verse 2:Jhonta Austin) 
 You had heart enough to handle me 
 But I kept my heart out of reach 
 Feeling strong enough to carry us 
 Still I violated every trust 
 Is it too late 
 I wonder to say I'm sorry 
 Too late 
 I wonder to bed your pardon 
 All I think about is how I messed it up 
 And all I think about is how I need ya love 
 (Bridge: Johnta Austin) 
 And if I had it to do all over 
 I would find me another way 
 To express what's on my mind 
 And try to find me the words I wanna say 
 And now I'm to hurt to love another 
 But I'm too proud to ask you back 
 I don't know if you'll ever get to hear this song 
 But I needed to tell you that 
 When I 
 When I first let you go I ain't know that it would hurt 
 But I miss you 
 I ain't never had it bad 
 But each day is gettin' worse 'cause I miss you 
 Baby 
 Sorry 
 The things I said and the things I did 
 If you want to hurry home 'cause I'm sittin' here alone 
 'Cause I miss you 
 (Chris Brown) 
 And If I can see you 
 I'll tell you that I'm sorry 
 I'll tell you that it's my fault 
 And I don't wanna be alone 
 And if I can hold you 
 I'll love you like I never did before 
 And then I would love you more 
 Never ever let you go 
 (Johnta Austin (Chris Brown) 
 I swear that if I had it to do all over (had it to do) 
 I would find me another way (find another way) 
 To express what's on my mind 
 And try to find me the words I wanna say 
 And now I'm to hurt to love another (too hurt to love) 
 But too damn proud to ask you back (too proud to ask you back) 
 I don't know if you'll ever get to hear this song 
 But I needed, I needed to tell you that 
 When I first let you go I ain't know that it would hurt 
 But I miss you 
 I ain't never had it bad 
 But each day is gettin' worse 'cause I miss you 
 Baby 
 Sorry 
 The things I said and the things I did 
 If you want to hurry home 'cause I'm sittin' here alone 
 'Cause I miss you
