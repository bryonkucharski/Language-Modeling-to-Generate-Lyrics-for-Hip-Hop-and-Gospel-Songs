Stay behind the Yellow Tape 
 Stay behind the Yellow Tape 
 Stay behind the Yellow Tape 
 Yeah, stay behind the Yellow Tape 
 Wait a second, wait a minute 
 Don't compare me to them other niggas 
 Desert Eagle, Smith and Wesson 
 I'm about to go to war, gon' pledge allegiance 
 Where the real friends at when you really need 'em? 
 When I was locked up in the county, I ain't even see 'em 
 I bought my own lane, lonely 
 What happen to the bitches in the party? 
 A 100 bottles that was every weekend 
 Bitches piled up in my crib like a Colosseum 
 After 3 A.M., you know we getting freaky 
 Hella one night stands, we just catching feelings 
 Tired of fake loving, fake Hollywood, ain't 'bout shit 
 Fake gang banging and they claiming to pop shit 
 Fake titties and cocaine up they nostrils, stop It, huh 
 So woo, a nigga, been about it 
 And if it's my time to go, I'm taking everybody 
 Don't care, my niggas, we shootin' anybody 
 And if it ain't your business, nigga, don't worry about it, oh 
 I hear 'em talking down on me, down on me 
 But where they at tonight? Got a 100 rounds on me 
 I think I had it up to here, my nigga, huh 
 You know your killers, they fear my niggas, huh 
 So what you tryna, tryna do, tryna, tryna do? 
 Dancing round the issue, bitch, you know you're running out of moves 
 I keep it real, my nigga, huh 
 This Richard Mille hella clear, cost a mil, my nigga 
 Yeah, give a fuck about how you feel, my nigga 
 Got the mic, life a horror movie, feel like thriller 
 Passive aggressive bitches always acting all timid 
 Won't help you make no money but I bet they'll help you spend it, ha 
 Had a meeting with the devil last week 
 Couldn't believe what he said to me, huh 
 "Here take this contract, signature please 
 You can have it all but you know your soul, I'ma keep" 
 Bad luck, bad luck, yeah, you know it come in threes 
 Battling my demons, I'm the only one who sees, ha 
 I've got the fire blazing, burning all the weed 
 I bet the hell ain't hotter than this fucking Hennessy, yeah 
 Two feet off the ground, whoa, whoa, like why am I living here? 
 Up and down, up and down, whoa, whoa, I think I might drown from my tears 
 I cry 'cause my fate is sold, too many tears, I'm thinking 'bout ending here 
 Wanna forget, Russian roulette with the pistol 
 Bang, bang, bang, yeah, that's all it take 
 Wahyo, wahyo, wahyo, wahyo, stand behind the yellow tape 
 Ay, bang, bang, bang, yeah, that's all it take 
 Wahyo, wahyo, wahyo, wahyo, stand behind the yellow tape, hey 
 Go bang, bang, bang, yeah, that's all it take 
 Don't shoot, don't shoot, stand behind the yellow tape 
 Don't shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot, don't 
 Stand behind the yellow tape 
 Wonder if God got a sense of humor 
 I hope you know that he can see all the shit you doing 
 Know I'm a sinner but I hope that he still listen to me 
 Temptation and fornication, you know I love the pussy 
 Misdirection with no connection, ain't no substance 
 She just wanna fuck, whatever happened to us love making? 
 You don't wanna be in the club when you an old lady 
 And I know I'm too fucked up to love my own lady 
 Ain't gon' lie, every nigga cheat, frontin' like they poppin' bottles 
 All these niggas cheap, me? I'm standing on my wallet 
 It don't mean I ain't lonely 
 In the Hills, all the way up, Uber X sittin' at the bottom 
 You know I ain't gotta flex, nigga, know I got it 
 Chain cost a quarter mil', me? That's a couple dollars 
 Sayin', "Fuck it", takin' pornstars to Benihanas 
 What's the point of rockin', rollin' without the gun powder? 
 Had a meeting with the devil last week 
 Couldn't believe what he said to me, huh 
 "Here take this contract, signature please 
 You can have it all but you know your soul, I'ma keep" 
 Bad luck, bad luck, yeah, you know it come in threes 
 Battling my demons, I'm the only one who sees, ha 
 I've got the fire blazing, burning all the weed 
 I bet the hell ain't hotter than this fucking Hennessy, yeah 
 Two feet off the ground, whoa, whoa, like why am I living here? 
 Up and down, up and down, whoa, whoa, I think I might drown from my tears 
 I cry 'cause my fate is sold, too many tears, I'm thinking 'bout ending here 
 Wanna forget, Russian roulette with the pistol 
 Bang, bang, bang, yeah, that's all it take 
 Wahyo, wahyo, wahyo, wahyo, stand behind the yellow tape 
 Ay, bang, bang, bang, yeah, that's all it take 
 Wahyo, wahyo, wahyo, wahyo, stand behind the yellow tape, hey 
 Go bang, bang, bang, yeah, that's all it take 
 Don't shoot, don't shoot, stand behind the yellow tape 
 Don't shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot, don't 
 Stand behind the yellow tape
