She look up from the book she was readin 
 With the prettiest smile that I ever saw 
 Curly hair down back 
 And the skin like cinnamon brown without a flaw 
 And then those eyes 
 Made my heart stop in my chest 
 And she said "Hi" 
 And it was hard to catch my breath 
 I said "Hey lil mama 
 I don't mean to bother at all, My name is Chris" (hello, hello) 
 And before she could answer, 
 I said "Listen to this: I think you're fineee" 
 And she cracked that smile again 
 Et's say goodbye to my homies and your friends 
 We can dip out alone (keep it movin) 
 Do something fun (& keep it movin) 
 Talk about life 
 About love 
 That's wats up 
 Keep it movin (oh) 
 Don't matter at all (all) where ever go (go) oh (oh) 
 Girl just come on let's keep it movin 
 So we exchange numbers 
 I told her I'll be at her crib by a quarter to six 
 We can go get a bite little lady, 
 Or chill at the mall and catch a flick 
 If that's all right (all right) 
 She said "As long I'm home by nine (nine) 
 Whatever we do is fine" 
 I can't believe (I can't believe that she's here with me, no) 
 And god oh me no (god oh me knows, how far we can go) 
 Then I hope this night will go my way (and we can do this everyday) 
 And if I'm cool and take my time, 
 I might just get a kiss goodnight 
 We can dip out alone (keep it movin) 
 Do something fun (& keep it movin) 
 Talk about life 
 About love 
 That's wats up 
 Keep it movin (oh) 
 Don't matter at all (all) where ever go (go) oh (oh) 
 Girl just come on let's keep it movin
