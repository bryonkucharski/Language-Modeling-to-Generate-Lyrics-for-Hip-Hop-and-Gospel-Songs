(Kevin McCall) 
 Even though you're fine as fuck 
 We're just making matters worse 
 Go from us kissin' to you burning my stuff 
 What you wanna break shit for 
 Did you buy this? no 
 Girl what the hell yo think this is? 
 I think you really need to stop this shit 
 'Cause I'm not gonna have it 
 It was fun while it lasted 
 What does it look ... 
 (Chorus - Chris Brown) 
 No, no 
 This ain't love, love no 
 Every night, fuss and fight, something ain't right 
 With us, girl 'cause we rushed this love 
 Neither one of us can blame the other 
 So maybe we should say goodbye 
 We can make this kiss the last kiss goodnight, tonight 
 So maybe we should say goodbye 
 Go our separate ways, hey, let's, call it quits 
 (Chris) 
 We gotta stop this thing between us 
 Girl you're 'bout to make me cuss you out 
 Kick you up out my house 
 Here's your clothes there's a door and go shawty 
 On your birthday now my shawty number 2 gon' be in 1st place 
 To the main chick 
 'Cause I'm not gon' have it 
 It was fun while it lasted 
 Girl you got to go 
 No, no 
 This ain't love, love no 
 Every night, fuss and fight, something ain't right 
 With us, girl 'cause we rushed this love 
 Neither one of us can blame the other 
 So maybe we should say goodbye 
 We can make this kiss the last kiss goodnight, tonight 
 So maybe we should say goodbye 
 Go our separate ways, hey, let's, call it quits
