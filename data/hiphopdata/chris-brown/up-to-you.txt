What the hell babe, 
 Damn I ain't never felt this way 
 Somebody, somebody, tell me 
 I don't have a clue what to do 
 When it comes to you 
 Baby, you're so beautiful 
 Every time I see you girl, it throw me off 
 It's so unusual 
 For me to be waiting 
 But I don't want to blow it girl, 
 But you should know this girl 
 I'm not gonna be the one to mess this up 
 'Cause I done effed up in love before, 
 I'ma be the one to take a back seat girl 
 We can take our time and 
 You can run this, Stay in, go out, 
 Anything you want girl, we can do 
 Girl are we going down, I don't know, 
 But from here now baby I'm gone leave that up to you, 
 I'ma leave it up to you 
 What the hell babe 
 Make me wanna jump out an airplane 
 The way it feels, I just can't explain 
 I don't wanna lose it, so I'm just gone stay out my own way 
 Baby, you're so incredible (you're so beautiful), 
 Every time I see you girl, it throw me off 
 It's some kind of special (unusual) 
 So I'm gone keep waiting 
 But I don't wanna blow it girl, 
 But you should know this girl... 
 I'm not gonna be the one to mess this up 
 'Cause I done effed up in love before, 
 I'ma be the one to take a back seat girl 
 We can take our time and 
 You can run this, Stay in, go out, 
 Anything you want girl, we can do 
 Girl are we going down, I don't know, 
 But from here now baby I'm gone leave that up to you, 
 (Breakdown) 
 I'm not tryna be a heart breaker, like I was before 
 (That was the old me) 
 I've made so many tears, I don't wanna make no, make no more 
 So give me your list, yes I'm checking things off 
 Ready to go to work, baby you can be boss 
 And I'm okay with it, ain't gone play with it 
 So baby girl, it's your call 
 I'm not gonna be the one to mess this up 
 'Cause I done effed up in love before, 
 I'ma be the one to take a back seat girl 
 We can take our time and 
 You can run this, Stay in, go out, 
 Anything you want girl, we can do 
 Girl are we going down, I don't know, 
 But from here now baby I'm gone leave that up to you, 
 Leave that up to you
