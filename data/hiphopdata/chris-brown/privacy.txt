I need your body in ways 
 That you don't understand, but I'm losing my patience 
 'Cause we've been going over and over again 
 Girl, I just wanna take you home and get right to it 
 Know I gotta kiss it, baby 
 Give it to me, lick it lick it inside and out 
 You know that I just wanna make love 
 Want you to scream and shout 
 And baby, when I'm deep in it now 
 I'ma slow it down, 'cause ain't no speed limit 
 When we're moving at the speed of sound 
 We gon' turn all the way up when the lights down 
 Why your pussy so damn good, miss lady? 
 Go and put that booty up, baby, one on one 
 You know I'ma go crazy when your legs in the air 
 You know your panties never getting in the way 
 You know I kinda like it, when you make me work for it 
 Ay you, gal, with all the tight up skirt 
 Get that ass in the bed, I'ma lock the door 
 Shake that ass like boom shakalacka, boom shakalacka (boom, boom) 
 We don't need nobody watching us (yikes!) 
 No eyes but your eyes 
 Ain't nobody here but you and me 
 Licking your private parts (Boom shakalacka, hahaha) 
 And I know you love your privacy 
 You don't need a shower, you already wet 
 Know that pussy power, telling me, I ain't ready yet 
 I say, "Fuck it," face my fears, baby 
 When I lick it, I put tears in it 
 Put my face in it, eat it like a dinner date 
 You know I love foreplay, 12 play, everything 
 Know my lovin' don't change 
 I don't really give a fuck what a hater say 
 'Cause you fine, baby 
 And it's alright 'cause you're all mine, baby, ooh, hoo 
 Girl, I'ma let you get crazy 
 Ay you, gal, with all the tight up skirt 
 Get that ass in the bed, I'ma lock the door 
 Shake that ass like boom shakalacka, boom shakalacka (boom, boom) 
 We don't need nobody watching us (yikes!) 
 No eyes but your eyes 
 Ain't nobody here but you and me 
 Licking your private parts (Boom shakalacka, hahaha) 
 And I know you love your privacy 
 Baby, I promise I won't tell nobody 
 Just long as you let me hit it like every night 
 I could give a fuck 'bout the club, 'cause that pussy tight 
 Do a split on it, drop it, baby, show you right 
 I'ma split your weave and you askin' me to stay the night 
 Whipped cream on your titties, then you suckin' on my dick with ice 
 Oh my God, oh my God, my bitch get me right 
 Ain't gotta pay for that pussy, my dick can change your life 
 I'm tired of missionary, wanna see you on your face 
 Put that ass up in the air, I'm lovin' how that pussy taste 
 Damn, on your side, on your side 
 Stop runnin' from this dick, I ain't 'bout to let you slide this time 
 Ay you, gal, with all the tight up skirt 
 Get that ass in the bed, I'ma lock the door 
 Shake that ass like boom shakalacka, boom shakalacka (boom, boom) 
 We don't need nobody watching us (yikes!) 
 No eyes but your eyes 
 Ain't nobody here but you and me 
 Licking your private parts (Boom shakalacka, hahaha) 
 And I know you love your privacy 
 Privacy 
 Boom shakalacka 
 Hahaha
