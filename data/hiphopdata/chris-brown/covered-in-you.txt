Oh, oh 
 Ooh, na na 
 Na na na, girl 
 Hold on to me tight, yeah 
 And if you feel any pressure, that's alright, alright 
 There's a leak in your Levi, it's on the verge of caving in 
 But I'm prepared if it breaks, baby, so whenever you feel it coming, don't fight 
 Yeah, never been scared to get wet 
 No umbrella, you can rain all night, oh whoa, whoa 
 And go ahead and drench me with your body 
 By the time you're finished 
 Baby, I'll be covered in you, yeah, yeah 
 Covered in you 
 Ooh, you know we'll be through 
 'Cause I'll be covered in you 
 Get yours and I'll get mine, yeah, yeah 
 You know I always hit your spots, baby, every time (time) 
 Oh yeah, feel it drip drop and your bottles turn to oceans, you know I won't stop till I feel it overflow (drip drop) 
 Tell me, tell me, baby, would you mind if I just jump right in there, take a dive? 
 Yeah, never been scared to get wet 
 No umbrella, you can rain all night, oh whoa, whoa 
 And go ahead and drench me with your body 
 By the time you're finished 
 I'll be covered in you, yeah, yeah 
 Covered in you 
 Ooh, you know we'll be through 
 'Cause I'll be covered in you 
 I ain't running, keep it coming 
 Till I'm covered, baby, covered in you 
 Ooh, you know we'll be through 
 Until I'll be covered in you 
 Covered in you, you 
 Wanna be covered, covered in you, you (yeah, yeah) 
 You, whoa, whoa, in your love, baby 
 Covered in you
