You got me doing 101 on the 101 
 Don't go nowhere baby, don't you run 
 You got me doing 101 on the 101 
 Got me speeding for your love 
 I been waiting for you all day 
 Stuck in traffic, tryna make it to my baby 
 I'm tryna go half on a baby 
 Just wear that sexy shit I like 
 And I will do you just right 
 Don't you worry, help is soon on the way 
 I'll kiss you up 
 I'll lick you up 
 I'll stick it up 
 I'll smack it up 
 I'll flip it up 
 I'll pick you up 
 I'll sex you up 
 I like it when your bottom up 
 Your top down, take you down 
 Won't fuck around 
 I'll hold you down 
 I'mma break it down 
 When I lay you down 
 Yeah
