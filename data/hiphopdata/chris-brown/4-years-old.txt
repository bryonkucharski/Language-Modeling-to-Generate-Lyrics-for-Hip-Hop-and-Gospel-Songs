I got money 
 Everything that I ever wanted 
 Never thought of what I might need, 
 Need, need 
 Ain't it funny, 
 How I spend my whole life running 
 Reaching for the sky high and coming down with nothing 
 Feels like I'm 4 years old all over again 
 'Cause I'm just running fast 
 Should be walking 
 Saying when I grow up 
 You gon' see 
 I'm gon' be comfortable and happy 
 I guess I was faking 
 Cause look at all the money I'm making 
 Still nothing can compare to the thought 
 Of love 
 But it's taking 
 Too much time to see that I'm wasting 
 Reaching for the sky high and coming down with nothing 
 It feels like I'm 4 years old all over again 
 'Cause I'm just running fast 
 Should be walking 
 Saying when I grow up 
 You gon' see 
 I'm gon' be comfortable and happy 
 I'm so alone, 
 I feel so alone, 
 So alone in this world 
 Got everything I want 
 It feels like I'm 4 years old all over again 
 'Cause I'm just running fast 
 Should be walking 
 Saying when I grow up 
 You gon' see 
 I'm gon' be comfortable and happy 
 Whoa
