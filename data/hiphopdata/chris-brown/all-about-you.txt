How'd did you get so young 
 I heard that you were born today 
 Heard that you came from 
 The sky and I just wanna say 
 Welcome, the world is glad you're here to stay 
 Have fun, it's time to give another day 
 Sometimes the fire can get in your way 
 But that ain't nothing 
 You can't blow away 
 So make a wish 
 I have one too 
 I wish that I could stay with you 
 Wish you knew 
 How much I want all your wishes to come true 
 It's all about you 
 It's all about you 
 Today, today 
 It's all about you 
 It's all about you 
 Today, today 
 Girl do you want 
 I swear I'll give you everything 
 Look I parked out front 
 Flowers, bags and wedding rings 
 Well done, the world is glad you're here to stay 
 Have fun, it's time to give another day 
 Sometimes the fire get in the way 
 But that ain't nothing 
 You can't blow away 
 So make a wish 
 I have one too 
 I wish I that could stay with you 
 Wish you knew 
 How much I want all your wishes to come true 
 It's all about you 
 It's all about you 
 Today, today 
 It's all about you 
 It's all about you 
 Today
