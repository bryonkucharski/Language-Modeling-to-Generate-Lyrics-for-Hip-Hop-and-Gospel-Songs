Girl, it just don't feel the same, wish I could go back in time 
 Seems like every time I say your name, I just wanna press rewind 
 You said you just want me bad, but I don't think that you ready, yeah 
 And I know that you want me to stay 
 You said if I love you I would, I would, I would, I would 
 If we look at how we live, it's no good 
 Babe, it's no good, no good, no good, no good 
 And you know, you know I'm right 
 'Cause we're just fucking, baby 
 This ain't loving, baby 
 We're just fucking, baby 
 But this ain't loving, baby 
 No, you want it 
 I ain't your man, girl, I'm only your friend 
 Wish that I could read your mind 'cause I don't know if you telling the truth 
 You can tell me every lie, tell me how do I believe you? 
 'Cause once we get to kissing, you gon' have me finished, and I'll feel something's missing 
 I say I'm cool fucking 'round with you 
 You said if I loved you I would, I would come back to you 
 If we look at how we live, it's no good 
 Babe, it's no good, no good, no good, no good 
 Girl, you know, you know I'm right 
 'Cause we're just fucking, baby 
 This ain't loving, baby 
 We're just fucking, baby 
 But this ain't loving, baby 
 No, you want it 
 I ain't your man, girl, I'm only your friend
