Baby I'll admit, I made a mistake 
 Don't know what I was thinking, what I had was so great 
 Tried it to my mind, went back to my heart, I know it ain't there 
 Sometimes I wannit all 
 Go head cuss me out 
 Girl I understand I will stay right here 
 And take it like a man 
 I really need you back, babe what I gotta do 
 Let me be honest, straight up tell the truth 
 I havent been the same since I left you, 
 I can't enjoy myself, even if I try too 
 I'm not happy, it ain't a laughing matter 
 And you don't understand my heart is Hallow 
 I didn't know Id end up like this 
 Said I didn't wanna, now I miss (you) 
 My heart is Hallow 
 And I don't care if the neighbors hear me loud, 
 Baby I'll scream it out, I didn't know what I was thinking bout 
 Hallow 
 Thought I wanted to spread my wings 
 But I'm empty trying to do my things, out in these streets 
 I wanna fly back (can I come back) home 
 Without your love it's Hallow 
 Girl 
 I will never be 
 The same no more 
 Promise I can do you better, sincerely yours 
 Many times, I didn't even try, and even when I told them lies, you stay wonderful girl 
 Can I least just get the chance to show you ah, that I'm not a little boy I won't make you cry 
 And it means now, All we need is time 
 We can get back to the way things were 
 I havent been the same since I left you, 
 I can't enjoy myself, even if I try too 
 I'm not happy, it ain't a laughing matter 
 And you don't understand my heart is Hallow 
 I didn't know Id end up like this 
 Said I didn't wanna, now I miss (you) 
 My heart is Hallow 
 And I don't care if the neighbors hear me loud, 
 Baby I'll scream it, I didn't know what I was thinking bout 
 Hallow 
 Thought I wanted to spread my wings 
 But I'm empty trying to do my things, out in these streets 
 I wanna fly back (can I come back) home 
 Without your love it's Hallow 
 Only so much I can take, this love is broken down 
 Come rescue me, I need your arms 
 Gently wrapped around 
 Say you need me, and don't let go 
 And just to put it simply, girl my heart is empty 
 My heart is Hallow 
 I didn't know Id end up like this 
 Said I didn't wanna, now I miss 
 My heart is Hallow 
 And I don't care if the neighbors hear me loud, 
 Baby I'll scream it, I didn't know what I was thinking bout 
 Hallow 
 Thought I wanted to spread my wings 
 But I'm empty trying to do my things, out in these streets 
 I wanna fly back (can I come back) home 
 Without your love it's Hallow
