Everybody see's it's you 
 I'm the one that lost the view 
 Everybody says we're through 
 I hope you haven't said it too 
 So where 
 Do we go from here? 
 With all this fear in our eyes 
 And where 
 Can love take us now? 
 We've been so far down 
 We can still touch the sky 
 If we crawl 
 Till we can walk again 
 Then we'll run 
 Until we're strong enough to jump 
 Then we'll fly 
 Until there is no end 
 So let's crawl, crawl, crawl 
 Back to love, Yeah 
 Back to love, Yeah 
 Why did I change the pace 
 Hearts were never meant to race 
 I always felt the need for space 
 But now I can't reach your face 
 So where 
 Are you standing now 
 Are you in the crowd of my faults 
 Love, can you see my hand? 
 I need one more chance 
 We can still have it all 
 If we crawl (if we crawl) 
 Till we can walk again 
 Then we'll run (then we'll run) 
 Until we're strong enough to jump 
 Then we'll fly 
 Until there is no end 
 So let's crawl, crawl, crawl 
 Back to love, yeah 
 Back to love, yeah 
 Everybody see's it's you 
 Well I never wanna lose that view 
 So we'll crawl (if we crawl) 
 Till we can walk again 
 Then we'll run 
 Until we're strong enough to jump 
 Then we'll fly 
 Until there is no end 
 So let's crawl, crawl, crawl 
 So we'll crawl (ooh) 
 Till we can walk again (till we can walk again) 
 Then we'll run (we'll run) 
 Until we're strong enough to jump (until we're strong enough to jump) 
 Then we'll fly (then we'll fly) 
 Until there is no end 
 So let's crawl, let's crawl, let's crawl 
 Back to love
