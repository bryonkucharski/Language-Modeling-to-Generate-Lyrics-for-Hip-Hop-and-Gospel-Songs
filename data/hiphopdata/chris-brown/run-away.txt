Oh, what a day 
 Them boys they wild, they run with the Ks 
 But them boys are blue they won't catch a case 
 Hands up, don't shoot, ain't nobody safe 
 And I'm just tryna love you 
 I'm tryna give my all to you (oh yeah) 
 Might fuck around and empty the safe 
 So come with me now, let's just run away 
 Run away-way, now (yeah, woo) 
 Way, woah, yeah 
 Way, come on 
 Run away 'cause nobody safe 
 'Cause no 'cause nobody safe 
 Pushin' up on me and I don't like it, like it 
 Who is your homie? I need his ID 
 I see them lights flashin' behind me 
 Thinking 'bout life and what do I need? 
 I see my life, sitting beside me 
 House with the lies, stuck with the IV, oh 
 But them boys in blue, they won't catch a case, no (case) 
 Hands up, don't shoot, ain't nobody safe, yeah 
 And I'm just tryna keep my cool, you're going too far 
 And I'm just tryna love you 
 I'm tryna give my all to you 
 Might fuck around and empty the safe 
 So come with me now, let's just run away 
 Run away-way, now 
 Way, woah, yeah 
 Way, come on 
 Run away 'cause nobody safe 
 'Cause no 'cause nobody safe 
 You got a glass heart 
 It's hard to reach you but if you'll see through 
 Skip to the sad part 
 Forgive but never forget who you are 
 'Cause your smile, it just reminds me 
 How I can never put chill behind me 
 Baby, you can ride shotgun 
 Or make love in the backseat 
 Make a difference, change my life and save me 
 Don't even know it 
 Make a difference, change my life and save me 
 Don't even know it 
 And I'm just tryna love you (love you) 
 I'm tryna give my all to you (oh yeah) 
 Might fuck around and empty the safe (empty the safe) 
 So come with me now, let's just run away (just run away) 
 Run away-way, now (now) 
 Way, woah, yeah 
 Way, come on 
 Run away 'cause nobody safe 
 'Cause no 'cause nobody safe (nobody safe)
