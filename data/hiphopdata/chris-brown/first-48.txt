Like a circus freak, all right, where that beat go? 
 Okay, leggo 
 Look, gon' make 'em clap, make 'em do that 
 And when this nigga rap, they be like "Who that?" 
 She in the party super wet, where the pool at? 
 I got a big head, so my hat adjust to two snaps 
 Money to the ceiling, tell me where my roof at 
 Your pants too tight, maybe you just too fat 
 Just a Cheeto with Doritos, yeah, I lay 'em like du-rags 
 Boy, I know why you mad, cause my chain stupid 
 And your girl leaning all on me 
 I'mma give her a couple of drinks, and then I put her ass to sleep 
 Bedtime, if she come she a freak 
 Then you read them headlines that she fucking with CB 
 What you mean? I'mma ball out 
 I'm driving space ships, I threw my cars out 
 What I call a garage, you call a house 
 Live in that hole in the wall, you are a mouse 
 They be like "Chris, you killing it" Soprano 
 Valet tryna steal my keys, nigga this ain't no piano 
 What you mean? I'm the president, but fuck a 'bout a panel? 
 They gonna have to change the channel, 'cause it's way too much to handle 
 Yep, haha all that bullshit, I ain't hearing it 
 'Cause I'm on point, like a pyramid 
 And I'm flushing you turds, killing shit 
 Only hear two words, nigga sick 
 Yeah, I'm the B-E-S-T-E-S-T 
 I'm in that Range, you in that low key 
 Off that super loud, the car smoking, but it's Friday 
 What up Smokey? 
 Damn, man all these cameras are bananas 
 And the waitress hate me, hope she don't spit in my sandwich 
 Yeah, y'all can't get at me like a mention 
 Indirectly, y'all respect me, because this boy in detention 
 But still I walk around too proud 
 Neighbors mad at me, 'cause I fuck too loud 
 You would think I was police, how I move crowds 
 Vagina, two up, two down 
 Team Breezy, yeah I'm repping it 
 We the shit boy, so don't step in it 
 I'm all about my stripes, like a veteran 
 And it's getting too late, I need to take my medicine 
 Okay okay, let me go 
 Nigga be shining, and oh soul glow 
 Boy, look at all these diamonds 
 And my chain so heavy, and my neck be whining 
 Can't see you, all I see is my shades 
 Girl, got her giddy giddy, Frankie Lymon 
 I make her cum like clockwork 
 What you call that? Perfect timing 
 They call me Hercules, just like a slave, she working me 
 Know she off that bonny, when she smoking and got them purple leaves 
 7-Eleven head, no hands when she slurping me 
 Then she swallowed my sword, like a circus freak
