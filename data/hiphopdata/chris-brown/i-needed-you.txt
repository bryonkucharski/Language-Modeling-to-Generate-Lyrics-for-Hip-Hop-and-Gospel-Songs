Told that I'm supposed to fail 
 I wouldn't amount to much of nothin'. 
 Yes I pray 
 There was days I wondered if you really loved me. 
 But baby you feel pain. 
 Mama was savin' a pair like runnin' away. 
 I couldn't take it. 
 So hinted and angry with all of the world. 
 I couldn't keep friends just wishin' you'd come back and see 
 My difficult times being an adolescent. 
 And like so many just like me without a shoulder to lean. 
 I needed you 
 When I needed a father figure. 
 I needed you 
 To stop me from makin' a wrong decision. 
 At seventeen, when the cold of the world had my back up against the wall. 
 I need, I needed you. 
 I need, I needed you.

 Mama had no financial help 
 And thoughts of breakin' the law came. 
 Seen her tryna hold down two jobs was tearin' up on me had a way (had a way). 
 All my friends was gettin' in it 
 It came time for me to get that dough. 
 Wrong or right I had to go for what I know.

 Lord I pray. Give me strength to forgive them and not all the I hate I got. Even though the pain of this was too heavy. Lord I pray. Show me all brothers growin' up without a father had a turn with a day adolescent to a legacy. Lord I pray.) 
 From the knowledge I ain't get 
 God, you gave me. 
 And temptation was callin' me, didn't know which way to go.
