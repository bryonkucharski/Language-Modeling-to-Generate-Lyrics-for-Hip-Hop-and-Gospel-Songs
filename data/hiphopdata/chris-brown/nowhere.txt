I wish I could forget you, wouldn't that be nice? 
 But I'm reminded of the wrongs we couldn't right 
 Girl, say your peace, girl, wish you'd a been right 
 I'm going left, I'm tryna pick me up, hey, girl it's like it is a chase, yeah 
 Oh girl, you've been giving me hell 
 You know, you said it yourself 
 That I would find no other love, now here I am 
 Baby, if I could get you, up out my head, maybe for a second now, oh whoa 
 Oh, I just can't get over you 
 Chasing my tail like a fool 
 You got me going right around, right around, right around (ooh, ooh) 
 Chasing down your love, oh, oh, around I'm going nowhere 
 Damn, too important to forget you and it's hard not to miss you 
 'Cause all I see is flashbacks in my bed, pillow cases, traces of your smell 
 This thing's going nowhere, you said you needed space but now the coast's clear 
 Oh, we could have had this so good, oh 
 Baby, you've been giving me hell 
 You know, you said it yourself (said it yourself) 
 That I would find no other love, now here I am (and now here I am) 
 Baby, if I could get you, up out my head, maybe for a second now, oh whoa (oh) 
 Oh, I just can't get over you (you, oh no no no) 
 Chasing my tail like a fool 
 Girl, you got me going right around, right around, right around (ooh, ooh) 
 Chasing down your love, oh, oh, around I'm going nowhere 
 Right around, right around 
 Chasing down your love, oh, oh, around I'm going nowhere 
 Baby, if I could get you, up out my head 
 Maybe for a second now, oh whoa 
 Oh, I just can't get over you (you) 
 Chasing my tail like a fool (fool) 
 Girl, you got me going right around, right around, right around (ooh, ooh) 
 Chasing down your love, oh, oh, around I'm going nowhere
