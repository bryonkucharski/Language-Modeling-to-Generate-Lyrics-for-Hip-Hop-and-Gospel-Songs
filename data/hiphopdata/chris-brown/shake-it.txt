(Verse 1: Chris Brown) 
 You see what I'm sittin' on 
 You should be sittin' on these right in front of the club 
 Shawty what you sippin' on 
 You see me gettin' grown 
 So baby just show me some love yeah 
 T-Pain: 
 I want a girl like you 
 I could tell that you lookin' for a dude like me 
 Can you smell what I'm cookin' 
 Let me know if you wanna' ride 
 Chris Brown: 
 'Cause I ain't got nobody on my passenger side 
 (Verse 2: Chris Brown) 
 Baby I'm just hittin' on ya 
 I want to get to know ya 
 I don't want to waste your time 
 And I'm gonna keep it real with ya 
 I want to do with ya 
 Even if it's for one night 
 T-Pain: 
 Man. I want a girl like you 
 I could tell that your lookin' for a dude like me 
 Can you smell what I'm cookin' 
 Chris Brown: 
 I came to have some fun 
 I'll be on the dancefloor whenever you done 
 (Chorus: Chris Brown) 
 Shawty you the one 
 I got to get ya 
 Got to get with ya 
 I can do this.(rite in front of you girl) 
 I got the plan.The beach with the sand 
 And you got the man.(rite in front of you girl) 
 When you move it to the left 
 Move it to the right.You make me say

 You got them super thighs

 Chris Brown: 
 Girl I got my city on lock.You messin with me you gonna end up at the top and it won't stop 
 Baby tell me what you want to see 
 T-Pain:

 Girl I see they hatin' on ya.Just keep on skatin on them 
 Nile alligators on your feet.

 Girl I'm a take you home.And let you go crazy on me 
 Chris Brown:
