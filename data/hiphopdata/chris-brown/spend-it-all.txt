Go 'head, do ya dance 
 I know you see all of this money in my hand 
 And if you keep doin' it for me 
 I'mma spend it all 
 Just got my check I'm bout to spend it on the whole club 
 Half of these niggas can't pay rent after it's ova 
 Two chicks me, hit bipolar 
 Jamaican-Indian chicks they totem pole up 
 The way you move ya body girl 
 Make me wanna feel ya body girl 
 Girl I know you want it, ain't no change for all these hundreds 
 I'm about to make it rain, they should change your name to stormy 
 Girl you know my dick's enormous 
 Girl I love your performance 
 She said she was from New Orleans 
 Tryna sting her like a hornet 
 Upgrade her, that's a bonus 
 Her booty that's what I'm bonin' 
 Go 'head, do ya dance 
 I know you see all of this money in my hand 
 And if you keep doin' it for me 
 I'mma spend it all 
 It's alright, it's okay 
 Girl just keep poppin' that booty in my face 
 And if you keep poppin' dat booty 
 I'mma spend it all 
 Leggo, my eyes shit 'cause her booty all in my face 
 I touch, no computer she in my space 
 Damn look at mami lose it watch her gyrate 
 Breezy up in this bitch like a vibrate 
 ?Tor, V.I.P. with 2 of them 
 Got 2 cheeks use your booty for the A.T.M. 
 Credit cards, take off your bra have a menage 
 Particular, vehicular, call me the sarge 
 Round booty from the A-Town 
 Pull her hair, can't see nothing from the waist down 
 For them dollars make her holler like "woah" 
 And my transactions got them Jacksons, Michael 
 You corny rappers can't be serious 
 'Cause deep down we know you pussy, period. 
 So now it's back to getting more hoes 
 You niggas lack delivery, Digiorno 
 Go 'head, do ya dance 
 I know you see all of this money in my hand 
 And if you keep doin' it for me 
 I'mma spend it all 
 It's alright, it's okay 
 Girl just keep poppin' that booty in my face 
 And if you keep poppin' dat booty 
 I'mma spend it all 
 I'm feeling myself, done had a couple drinks, I start to feeling myself 
 I start to dance up on ya feeling under your belt 
 I need a tipper, when I'm dancing you put the money on my thighs 
 Just watch me real low but I'mma need a lil more if I'mma take it all off 
 Need you to dig in your pocket it's deeper 
 You say you a spender, then put your money where your mouth is 
 Go 'head, do ya dance 
 I know you see all of this money in my hand 
 And if you keep doin' it for me 
 I'mma spend it all 
 It's alright, it's okay 
 Girl just keep poppin' that booty in my face 
 And if you keep poppin' dat booty 
 I'mma spend it all
