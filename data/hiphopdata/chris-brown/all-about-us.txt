It's kinda crazy I feel this way 
 Baby I'm sayin', the kinda man that I've come to now 
 To be out there playin' 
 But babe I got alot to say 
 I want you to listen 
 'Cause I've been a fool goin' crazy 
 Without you with me 
 (x2) 
 Girllll oh I oh I oh I 
 I've been stupid lately 
 Girl I apolagize, I owe you baby 
 Please don't bury me alive 
 'Cause it's kilin me inside 
 And I can't lie 
 Ggirlll 
 I'm afraid that your cheatin' 
 Must have been my love 
 Me neglectin your trust 
 As if it is enough, I messed up 
 I'm afraid, that your givin' up 
 I did too much my love 
 Right now it's all about us 
 All about us all about us 
 My love 
 It's kinda crazy about my babe 
 She was never complain 
 She was never fed up with me 
 But I kept on changin 
 One time had the nerve to say 
 She was lamein 
 She couldNT compare 
 Them other girls wouldn't care 
 To be with me 
 Girllll oh I oh I oh I 
 I've been stupid lately 
 Girl I apolagize, I owe you baby 
 Please don't burry me alive 
 'Cause it's killin' mee 
 And I can't lieee 
 I'm afraid
