Haha what's up ladies 
 How y'all doin' 
 Yeah I know what y'all need 
 All of y'all 
 And that's y'all gangsta boo right 
 Come on 
 Yeah Yeah 
 Oh no no 
 It was 6 o'clock on the dot 
 That's when I seen this cutie 
 She was chillin' at the spot 
 She was wit her girls 
 I was wit my boys 
 All of a sudden 
 I asked her to come over and say 
 "Wot up ma 
 How'd you like to get to know me? 
 I'm not shy 
 I'll do anything for you and 
 I'm that guy 
 Say I pick you up at eight 
 I promise I won't be late" 
 [Girl] 'Cause all I ever wanted was 
 Someone I could hold on to 
 Someone who would never break my heart in two 
 [Chris] can I be the one for you? 
 [Girl] lets sing out and let's see 
 Shorty wanna rider (gangsta boo) 
 I told her that I'd call her (it's true) 
 I'm not looking for the love but 
 I think that you're the one 
 So come on come on 
 Shorty want a baller (gangsta boo) 
 Someone who can spoil her (it's true) 
 I'm not looking for the love but 
 I think that you're the one 
 So come on, come on 
 I never met no one like you before 
 But I gotta take this chance 
 'Cause if I don't I'll never know 
 What this girl is really looking for 
 I may not have all the money (so who cares) 
 I may not have all the fancy cars (I'd still be there) 
 But what I have to give you baby 
 Is so much more
