Get fresh baby this is your song 
 Put your good shoes and your lipstick on 
 Get fresh baby this is your song 
 You said you want a freak, I'mma give you what you want 
 Whole lot of sex, whole lot of liquor 
 Whole lot of chicks, not a lot of niggas 
 Not my party, all about the bitches 
 Sexy model, ass like Alicia's 
 See my main chick, she got that good shit 
 And her gang vicious so I call her sid 
 Girl you better be careful 
 Bragging on a dick now your friends want a sample 
 Fuck a 69, its 696 
 I be the 9, both y'all the 6 
 You go both ways, get a load of this 
 Beat it so hard, now she gotta take a piss 
 Then you can't even walk in the morning 
 Go to work yawning, : 
 Man your girlfriends on it 
 Ain't no fun if you ain't sharing with the homies 
 I'll make you run and tell your friends

 Thong to the side, she feel it in her guts 
 Ass in the air, fucking up your weave 
 Pulling on your hair baby let me hear you scream 
 This white game mean, I make a bitch cry 
 I lick your lips to your tits to your thighs 
 Throw you on your side, I'm working out the kinks 
 You sweating out the sheets, girl you fucking with a freak 
 She told you I'm a beast? well, she ain't never lie 
 I can go on both of you at the same time 
 Taking that pussy, bitch this mine 
 Throw that shit back, put an arch in your spine 
 I never waste time but I ain't in a rush 
 Hit it like a champ, I beat the pussy up
