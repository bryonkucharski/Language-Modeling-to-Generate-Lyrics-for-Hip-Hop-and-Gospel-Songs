Getting lifted, feeling right 
 Double cup, dirty Sprite 
 Baddest bitch, you know she mine 
 But you know I don't love 'em, and you know I don't cuff 'em, no 
 On the West side tryna feel the breeze 
 On a mission tryna fuck with OHB 
 She say she fell in love with the G in me 
 And she loving, she loving 
 You know I got the homies parked right outside 
 I'm in the blood red Lambo, yeah the what up 5 
 Got the killers and the bitches that be ready to ride 
 'Cause they loving, they loving 
 Picture me rollin' 64 sitting on track 
 Picture me rollin' top down, switching lanes 
 Picture me rollin' from VA to LA 
 Picture me rollin', picture me rollin', aw yeah 
 Rolled my weed up for the night, I'm tryna smoke, aw yeah 
 See them cops, you know we like too far, whoa yeah 
 If you don't smoke girl, it's all right, and I ain't worred 'bout a damn thing 
 That's more for me so I don't mind, I don't mind, oh 
 On the West side tryna feel the breeze 
 On a mission tryna fuck with OHB 
 She say she fell in love with the G in me 
 And she loving, she loving 
 You know I got the homies parked right outside 
 I'm in the blood red Lambo, yeah the what up 5 
 Got the killers and the bitches that be ready to ride 
 'Cause they loving, they loving 
 Picture me rollin' 64 sitting on track 
 Picture me rollin' top down, switching lanes 
 Picture me rollin' from VA to LA 
 Picture me rollin', picture me rollin', aw yeah
