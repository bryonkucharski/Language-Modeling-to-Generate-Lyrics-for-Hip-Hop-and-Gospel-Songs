Broken again 
 I'm down on my knees ripped apart 
 But I see you out there 
 So I'm taking these chains off my heart 
 I'm listening close for you 
 Feeling my way out the dark 
 I'm on my way to you 
 And won't nothing keep me from you 
 So I'll just free run, 
 Till my feet start to lift off the ground 
 I will just free run, 
 Till I find myself right where you are, oh 
 Whoa, whoa, I'll free run to you 
 Whoa, whoa, free run to you 
 Life with you leaving, 
 Is like being locked upside down 
 I'm all out of reasons to let 
 All this hurt keep me bound 
 I'll listen close for you 
 I don't wanna miss the good parts 
 I'm on my way to you 
 And no one will keep me from you 
 So I'll just free run, 
 Till my feet start to lift off the ground 
 I will just free run, 
 Till I find myself right where you are, oh 
 Whoa, whoa, I'll free run to you 
 Whoa, whoa, free run to you 
 So I'll just free run, 
 Till my feet start to lift off the ground 
 I will just free run, 
 Till I find myself right by your side, oh 
 Whoa, whoa, I'll free run to you 
 Whoa, whoa, free run to you
