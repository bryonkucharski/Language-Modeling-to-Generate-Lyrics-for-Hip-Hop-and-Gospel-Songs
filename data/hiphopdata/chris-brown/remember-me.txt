(Hook: Chris Brown & (Tyga)) 
 Girl you know we got the time 
 Got that pussy on my mind 
 Later on, what are we doing? 
 I know you're ready, show that ass 
 Girl you looking so bad, getting horny watching you do it 
 Girl I wanna kiss it, while you kissin' your girlfriends 
 I wanna see a whole lot of licking, that's a memory 
 (Yeah, bet I make that pussy remember me) 
 (Verse 1: Chris Brown) 
 I be banging all on that beat 
 808, she got the bass when her booty shake 
 She got her friends with her and they a sight to see 
 All that ass, don't let it go to waste 
 All this Hennessy, the liquor, 'bout to penetrate 
 While I'm pushing Lamborghini's on the interstate 
 I long-dick her, I'ma go for hours 
 You minute-made like lemonade 
 I'm fresh as fuck in these Margielas 
 I skate past a nigga better than veterans 
 Bipolar cold, give me the medicine 
 My chain too bright, no Thomas Edison 
 When I pull it out, bitch nervous 
 Better ride this wave - bitch, surf it 
 Girl, you better keep them legs open 
 The only thing you close is these curtains 
 And she only got time for a nigga if I take her out to eat 
 A nigga really gotta motivate 
 Man, that's too much work for the pussy 
 I don't work for the pussy, nigga really don't communicate 
 I'd rather lick it like a dinner plate 
 I'd rather keep my money in a safe 
 Bitch, I ain't got time to play 
 I need it now, not a minute late 
 (Verse 2: Tyga) 
 Drive your head to a king, nigga 
 Dream house, my dream's bigger 
 Got a deck of cards if my heart switch up 
 Ace of spades, her eyes lit up 
 Diamonds glitter in my car, thriller 
 She pray for me, that's god willin' 
 I'm hard to break my boss prison 
 Her new name : Ass-Zilla 
 She love a nigga and that pussy tight 
 Come through, fuck you all night 
 Some foreplay, that's all right 
 But she rather do number 69 
 High notes, it's prime time 
 On a couch, hit it from behind 
 Hit you with that large stroke 
 Now she fiendin' for that good dope, yeah 
 That's my bae, she cook and clean and I got it made 
 Handcuff like she a slave, touch ya, let ya tongue taste 
 So high, no ceiling space 
 Numb to it, can't feel her face 
 Yeah, she numb to it, can't feel her face 
 (Verse 3: Chris Brown) 
 Blowing up my line on the cellular 
 She wanna lock a nigga down, on the regular 
 Talking crazy to me like she own the dick 
 But I don't trust her as far as I can throw the bitch 
 Momma told me to find a keeper 
 But I switch like designer sneakers 
 A girl with the finest features 
 Every nigga wanna talk to her 
 But I got her first, finders keepers 
 Violins in the back, is my theme music 
 Her ass on my mind, I dream booty 
 Any nigga tryna fuck my bitch 
 Then its off with his head, how kings do it 
 My rings ruby 
 Red bandana, I stay woopin' 
 Got too many cribs, I stay movin' 
 Three Lambos, I stay coupin' 
 Yeah, but you don't hear me though 
 Virginia to the Westside 
 My car foreign, the girl sit on the left side 
 Smokin' weed on the plane, that's the best high 
 She gotta sign the waiver 'fore I let her fly 
 It's helipads on the boat 
 Chilling in the South of France, Saint-Tropez, Nice, Monaco 
 But nothing compare to what's in my pants 
 Girl, stop playing!
