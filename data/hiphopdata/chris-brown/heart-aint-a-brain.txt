It's a 360 turn 
 Sittin' where we begin 
 Beginning like here's the end 
 Like kissing 
 And missing class 
 But we needed to learn 
 Was different 
 Than just some math 
 It's the big picture 
 We missed it 
 The figures just didn't add up 
 We said 
 Let's not leave on bad terms 
 In between 
 Them bad words 
 This could be love right? 
 Uh, huh 
 But are we gonna leave 
 When it's this good? 
 Damnit just cause 
 Seems this lovin's 
 All for nothing 
 Baby, you know 
 A heart ain't a brain 
 But I think 
 That I still love you (still love you) 
 A happy endin' 
 Makes you cry 
 'Cause it ends 
 When you don't want to (don't want to) 
 And it makes perfect sense 
 To end it like the start 
 How do I explain 
 This nonsense to my heart? 
 A heart ain't a brain 
 But I'm thinkin' 
 That I still love you 
 It's a fly twist 
 Just when you said 
 I got this 
 Right when the fight 
 Has stopped it 
 Seem my body felt wrong 
 Held on them nights 
 We held on 
 We can't let it go 
 But if we don't then 
 We will never know 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 My heart is achin' 
 Thinkin' 'bout all the love we wasted 
 Ooh, ooh, oh 
 My heart's impatient 
 Can't understand the time we're takin' 
 My heart can't have 
 My heart can't decide 
 But it's tellin' me it's right 
 And I know that 
 We should just call it quits 
 But I'm thinkin' that all of this 
 Gotta Change 
 'Cause my heart's goin' insane
