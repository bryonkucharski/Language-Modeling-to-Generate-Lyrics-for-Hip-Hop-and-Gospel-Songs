I was crazy when I said I didn't love you, 
 From the first time that I ever saw you, 
 The emotions running deep underneath my skin, 
 Sign anywhere for your love, where do we begin. 
 So lay me down 
 Tell me what I wanna hear 
 Take me down 
 There's nobody else I'd rather be with. 
 I wanna wake up in your arms, 
 I wanna wake up in your arms, 
 I wanna wake up in your arms, 
 I wanna wake up in your arms. 
 Ohohoh [x4] 
 If my heart is outa place move over, 
 I coulda told you how it hurts, coulda told ya. 
 And now I want you I can feel it in my heartbeat, 
 It's like a race like I'm running in a track meet. 
 So lay me down 
 Tell me what I wanna hear 
 Take me down 
 There's nobody else I'd rather be with. 
 I wanna wake up in your arms, 
 I wanna wake up in your arms, 
 I wanna wake up in your arms, 
 I wanna wake up in your arms. 
 Ohohoh [x4]
