Ooh woah 
 Tired of the conversations, questions 'bout me 
 Every time I leave the house, when I'm in or when I'm out 
 Girlfriend say I treat you foul but I don't know 
 At the end of the day, you know yourself 
 And I'm tired of the times when you run your mouth 
 Time's only running out, baby, you made me take a vow 
 Stop your whining, and sum it up, what are we now? 
 At the end of the day, you know yourself 
 Can't hear when you're talking loud 
 Oh, you do the most, this shit's getting old, we both said enough 
 Went through this moment once when, my GPS broke 
 Don't know where to go 
 Every time I'm lost and found 
 Yeah, this is not the lost and found 
 Whose time are you wasting now? 
 'Cause every time I'm lost and found, yeah 
 Oh, tell me who's losing out 
 'Cause you say it's the end and playing games again, I found (I found) 
 Playing games again, I found, yeah 
 Playing games again, I found yeah 
 Baby, you were the one that I could trust the most, used to think you were beautiful 
 'Til you would drink too many toasts, what would your mama say if 
 Girl, you're drunk out your mind, oh my God, get to praying 
 Taking brandy with the wine, rude awakening 
 Lord don't save her, she think she a big girl 
 Think she gon' draft all the players, think she gon' be ballin' yeah 
 But no, no, no, no, I done worked too hard for these cars and this cash no, no, no, no 
 Selling your soul, might as well be selling your ass, no, no, no, stop kidding, girl, you know yourself 
 Every time I'm lost and found 
 Yeah, this is not the lost and found 
 Whose time are you wasting now? 
 'Cause every time I'm lost and found, yeah 
 Oh, tell me who's losing out 
 'Cause you say it's the end and playing games again, I found 
 I don't know why you keep fuckin' with niggas 
 That really don't be in the streets 
 Always actin' hard like they murderers 
 Tell them niggas just run into me 
 This is not the lost and found, girl, you're out of bounds 
 It take a lot of money to make her booty bounce 
 If you takin' shots, better make it count 
 And girl, don't do nothing for free 
 I see that shawty want her money back 
 She fuckin' all over the internet 
 Dollars, where the money at? 
 Fuck around and run it up for a sack 
 Stealin' weed, I bought my duffle bag 
 Only the, birds, bring them all back 
 Baby girl, don't try and go there 
 You already know that 
 Every time I'm lost and found, yeah (oh, oh, oh, every time) 
 This is not the lost and found (yeah) 
 Whose time are you wasting now? (Whose time are you wasting time?) 
 'Cause every time I'm lost and found ('cause every time I'm lost and found) 
 Oh, up and down, back and fourth, all around 
 Oh, tell me who's really losing out, yeah (tell me who's really losing out) 
 'Cause you say it's the end and playing games again, I found 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Oh, yeah, this is not the lost and found 
 Whose time are you wasting now?
