I love when you pulling up in your jeep 
 Bumping all your beats 
 Js on 
 With your shades on 
 Just to bring me something to eat 
 You the man up in these streets 
 But when it comes to my heart 
 That don't mean a thing no oh 
 So I hop up in your ride 
 Ooh it's hot as hell outside 
 Got the top down 
 With the doors off 
 With your hand on my thigh 
 Drive slow ooh 
 Take your time 
 Every little thing you do got me feeling some type away (away) 
 When you gimme that thunder you make my summer rain 
 (Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh) [2x] 
 Everyday, everyday 
 (2x) 
 And it won't stop 
 Oh oh 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh 
 Yeah 
 With every single part of me 
 My love for you is constantly 
 Forever and ever on repeat, on repeat 
 And it won't stop 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh 
 I love when we pulling up to the beach 
 Sand down to my feet 
 Sun down 
 Nobody around 
 That's one hell of a scene 
 You rocking my body, (rock, rock the boat Aaliyah) 
 Don't it sound familiar? 
 'Cause it feels like ah ah aye aye 
 Looking up in space 
 It's just me and my ba-ae 
 And it feels so amazing 
 Oh oh 
 All night 
 Ooh ooh ooh 
 Every little thing you do got me feeling some type away (away) 
 When you gimme that thunder you make my summer rain 
 (Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh) [2x] 
 Everyday, everyday 
 (2x) 
 And it won't stop 
 Oh oh 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh 
 Yeah 
 With every single part of me 
 My love for you is constantly 
 Forever and ever on repeat 
 On repeat 
 And it won't stop 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh 
 Everyday, everyday 
 I can't breathe 
 You take my breath away from me 
 Here's my heart 
 You got the key 
 Put that on eternity 
 I love you till infinity 
 Infinity [4x] 
 My babe 
 My everything 
 And when I think about it 
 Don't be making me wait baby 
 It won't ever stop 
 My heart won't skip a beat baby 
 And it'll keep going on [5x] 
 (2x) 
 And it won't stop 
 Oh oh 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh 
 Yeah 
 With every single part of me 
 My love for you is constantly 
 Forever and ever on repeat 
 On repeat 
 And it won't stop 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh
