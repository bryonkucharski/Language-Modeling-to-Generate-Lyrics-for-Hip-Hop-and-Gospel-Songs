Stop, where am I? 
 Shock, I can't cry 
 Pop, I need some space 
 No, this isn't me 
 Go, please let me breathe 
 I'll be back sooner than you know 
 I need this space 
 Just like you need it 
 I need this time 
 Time to clear up my mind 
 Wait, did you hear that? 
 Hear my heart beat 
 I need this feeling 
 Whoa yeah, I really need this 
 Well, I've been blind 
 I hope I'll be fine 
 Don't call me back, no 
 Yes, I see light 
 Now, it's so bright 
 Call my name, I'll be there soon 
 I need this space 
 Just like you need it 
 I need this time 
 Time to clear up my mind 
 Wait, did you hear that? 
 Hear my heart beat 
 I need this feeling 
 Wait, did you hear that? 
 Hear my heart beat 
 I need this feeling 
 Whoa yeah, I really need this 
 I need this, I need this 
 Really need, whoa 
 You know it's not personal 
 Sorry if I'm hurting you 
 Please don't give up on me now 
 I needed this time alone 
 To know I could come back home 
 To breathe, breathe, breathe 
 I need this space 
 Just like you need it 
 I need this time 
 Time to clear up my mind 
 Wait, did you hear that? 
 Hear my heart beat 
 I need this feeling 
 Wait, did you hear that? 
 Hear my heart beat 
 I need this feeling 
 I really need this 
 I need this, I need this 
 Whoa, whoa, yeah, oh 
 I really need 
 Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, I need 
 Really, really need 
 I need, I need this, need this, need this 
 I really need this
