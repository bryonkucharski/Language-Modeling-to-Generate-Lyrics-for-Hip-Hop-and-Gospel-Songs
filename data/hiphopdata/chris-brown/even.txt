Ooh, yeah 
 Do you remember the time when we fell in love? 
 'Cause I remember the night when you had enough of me creeping, oh 
 You packed up your bags and said you were leaving 
 You found a new man and said we were even now 
 Even now 
 It's funny how everything seems to even out 
 Even now 
 I wish you could put it behind you 
 Wish you would put up your blinders 
 Wish you would stop listening to you friends 
 And come to where no one would find us 
 Wish you would just keep your focus on me 
 So I can give you a reminder 
 That I can be who I'm supposed to 
 I can do better, I know you remember 
 Every single night, we were living life in love 
 Every single time, I was doing right, enough 
 To keep you around, now look at where I end up 
 Look where I end up 
 Remember the time when we fell in love? 
 'Cause I remember the night when you had enough of my creeping, oh 
 Baby, it was only for a season, maybe 
 And it ain't really had nothing to do with you, it was all really me (no, yeah) 
 'Cause I was tryna see the world like a dog on a leash (world, leash) 
 And you was tryna hold me back, I ain't wanna let you go, I held on now (yeah) 
 I let you go and I knew I should have never let you go ahead of it 
 You remember every single night, we were living life in love 
 Every single time, I was doing right, enough 
 To keep you around, now look at where I end up 
 Look where I end up 
 Remember the time when we fell in love? 
 'Cause I remember the night, I know you had enough of my creeping 
 Baby, it was only for a season, maybe 
 Keep going round, round in circles (keep going round, round in circles) 
 Hoping you understand my circumstance (hoping you understand my circumstance) 
 Lord knows I never meant to hurt you (Lord knows I never meant to hurt you) 
 Is it because I'm a dog now? 
 Wish I knew then what I know now 
 I'm not the same when I go out 
 I just keep it on the low now 
 Is it because I'm a dog now? 
 I'm not the same when I go out 
 Wish I knew then what I know now 
 I just keep it on the low now 
 Don't you remember the time when we fell in love? 
 'Cause I remember the night, I know you had enough of my creeping 
 Baby, it was only for a season, maybe 
 Keep going round, round in circles 
 Round in circles 
 Keep, keep, keep going round, round in circles 
 Round in circles
