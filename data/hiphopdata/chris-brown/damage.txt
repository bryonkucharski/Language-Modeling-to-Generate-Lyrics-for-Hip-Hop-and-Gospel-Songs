Damage... 
 You know... 
 Sometimes you don't realize what you've done, until you've seen the damage... 
 And I looked at the damage... 
 Whoa... yeah... yeah... Whoa... yeah ... 
 Look at the damage... 
 3 AM when my phone ring, beggin' me to come by, I was right around the corner... 
 I know I could've said no but I ain't stop, told me "come in, the doors unlocked for you". 
 My intuition, I should, have listened to it, 
 My girl, yo, she'd be pissed if she knew about this visit... 
 She had a tank top on, I took her tank top off, but should've stopped, STOP!.. [sigh] 
 But she ain't let me, kissed me soft and gently... she tempt me. 
 Right then I stopped thinkin' consequences... 
 Guess I must have lost my mind for a minute. listen. 
 Girl you know that I love. 
 Girl I love you. 
 With her that was lust... 
 Shouldn't have happened 
 I know I messed up... 
 One phone call started this whole thing now... 
 Look at the damage... damage... 
 Look at the damage... 
 Damage... damage that I caused you. 
 I know I broke your heart, 'cause I did you wrong. 
 Look at the damage, look at the damage that I caused... 
 The dumbest decision that I made that I ain't proud of, a few hours that meant absolutely nothing cost me your love... 
 I gotta live with regret, deserve to get what you give, now you won't listen to nothing that I'm saying. 
 Rode passed your house for hours, just to feel close to ya... 
 No cards, no gifts, no flowers, could get me back with chu'... 
 Your kiss, your touch, girl you know I'm missin' 
 But you got my heart inside a prison, listen. 
 Girl you know that I love. 
 Girl I love you. 
 With her that was lust... 
 Shouldn't have happened 
 I know I messed up... 
 One phone call started this whole thing now... 
 Look at the damage... damage... 
 Look at the damage... 
 I was trippin', I was dippin', with these women, in these streets. 
 Lost my girl, lost out there. 
 Wish I could take it back. 
 I was trippin', I was dippin', with these women, in these streets. 
 Wish I could, take that back... 
 Girl you know that I love. 
 Girl I love you. 
 With her that was lust... 
 Shouldn't have happened 
 I know I messed up... 
 One phone call started this whole thing now... 
 Look at the damage... damage... 
 Look at the damage...
