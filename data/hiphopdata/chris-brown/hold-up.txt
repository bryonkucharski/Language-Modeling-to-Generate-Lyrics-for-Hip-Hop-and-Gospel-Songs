This sounds like an elevator music 
 Chris Brown 
 Big Boi 
 Yeah 
 (Big Boi Rap) 
 Hook, line, and sinker 
 I knew she was mine the day I seen her 
 Got a big mouth bass 
 On the line 
 It's time for me to retrieve her 
 And go git her like a wild receiver 
 But we don't play no ball 
 See when it comes to you babygirl, 
 B.B. don't play at all 
 Verse 1 (Chris Brown): 
 On the real we need to nip this in the bud 
 'Cause we kept it real with everyone 
 So tell me why they hating (everybody's hating) 
 It feels like they just waiting (for us to grow apart) 
 Yeah 
 It's just hard for me to do 
 But baby if I'm your man 
 I guess I gotta be your man 
 These men just gotta understand 
 Little girl, with curves and hips, luscious lips 
 Girl I can't front now 
 I'm nervous 
 I'm like hold up 
 Wait, wait a minute 
 I'm genuine with it 
 I ain't tryna put no pimping in it 
 I'm like hold up 
 Can I talk to her? 
 Hold up 
 Can I take her out? 
 Hold up, uh 
 That's why I gotta tell you 
 Verse 2 (Chris Brown): 
 Now a days is so crazy 
 Out here 
 You'd wanna be cutting me 
 If your daughter struts with me 
 Lucky me, and you'd be lucky too 
 No entourage, no crew 
 Just me riding with my boo 
 I got her 
 But don't think I'm replacing you 
 Girl know you know what I do 
 And I know you made your mind up 
 It'll take days and days and decades to find another 
 Dude, that's gonna walk in my shoes 
 And girl keep it one with you 
 As long if you do the usual 
 Now baby please 
 Hang up the phone 
 'Cause I'm talking to your father 
 Mrs Jones, Mr Jones 
 I've been talking to your daughter 
 And she likes me 
 She told me she likes me 
 And I really like her 
 She's gonna be my wife 
 I say, baby, please 
 Hang up the phone 
 'Cause I'm talking to your father 
 Mrs Jones, Mr Jones 
 I've been talking to your daughter 
 And she likes me 
 He told me she likes me 
 And I really like her 
 She's gonna be my wife 
 (Big Boi Rap) 
 Now is the time for me to come clean 
 Now is the time for us to turn that yellow light to green light 
 And proceed us together, be more better like lemon pepper on your wings 
 And you'll never find another fellow that's better than your king 
 Know what I mean, know what I'm saying, know what I'm talking about, girl who is playing? 
 But we can't have no picket fence 'cause we got acres and acres of land 
 The haters are taking it mad 
 That we can handle these fakers with class 
 Mannerisms on that C.O. five and a half on they ass 
 Girl, bye, give it a try, give your boy a chance 
 Ever since you landed in my space it seems like I'm yours again 
 My top friend, drop them 
 We don't need no audience 
 Pop them 
 Put old Google on a boss back 
 I'm like hold up 
 Wait, wait a minute 
 I'm genuine with it 
 I ain't tryna put no pimping in it 
 I'm like hold up 
 Can I talk to her? 
 Hold up 
 Can I take her out? 
 Hold up, uh 
 That's why I gotta tell you 
 Baby, please 
 And she likes me 
 And I really like her 
 Baby, please 
 She's gonna be my wife 
 Baby, please
