Baby tonight it's gonna get nasty 
 I want you at the tip of my tongue, all down your body, no 
 My face is your pony ooh, and I want you to ride it 
 So I can drink your rivers down, you quench my thirst babe, no 
 I'm taking your lace panties off you, gripping your thighs, oh no 
 It's gon' be the greatest sex you ever had in your life 
 Tell me who gon' love you like me? Nobody 
 Who gon' touch you like me? Nobody baby 
 Who's gonna fuck you like Breezy? Nobody 
 Nobody yeah, say oh, you make me say oh 
 Climb up on my mountain, oh till I reach your valley 
 Damn your walls they fit like a glove, till you rain on me, yeah 
 Sending us in slow grind, feels so good I make her wanna cry 
 I'm a grab your waist and pick that ass up and make you lose control

 'Cause I hang with them killers that really be shooting 
 You don't answer my call, I'm a hop out them bushes 
 And I creep to your window like "Fuck is you doing?" 
 I'm feeling like a stalker, girl you know I'm crazy, that pussy amazing 
 I dive in your waters, let me get you till the morning 
 I say you be popping your pussy, you tell me you innocent 
 I know when I see friends with benefits 
 You know my Cartier friends got limo tints 
 But I can see through the attitude and silly shit 
 Girl no don't do that no more, took her out the car, right on the hood 
 We was fucking like animals, yeah 
 Tell me who gon' love you like me? Nobody 
 Who gon' touch you like me? Nobody baby 
 Who's gonna fuck you like Breezy? Nobody 
 Nobody yeah, say oh, you make me say oh
