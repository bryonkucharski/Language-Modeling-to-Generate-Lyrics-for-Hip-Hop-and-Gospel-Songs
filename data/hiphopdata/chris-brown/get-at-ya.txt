Where you going, slow it 
 Don't act like you don't see me 
 I'm glowing, show me 
 What you look like in the morning 
 Tone it on it, floating on 25s 
 I wouldn't be fly if I threw some D's on it 
 When I step to the floor I'm fresh low key 
 When I step through the door all eyes on me 
 Wanna be a star get on TV 
 It's bout to jump off in my car so come with me 
 (Oh baby) 
 Hey girl I love what you do (yeah) 
 The way ya making it move 
 I'm tryna give it to you (oh) 
 Said girl tryna get at ya (tryna)

 And I'm tryna get at ya

 Said girl tryna get at ya (tryna) 
 Tryna get at ya (hey hey hey hey)

 Girl I'm slowly approaching 
 Dodging those misdemeanors 
 They on it, (on it) want it (want it) 
 I know they waiting on me 
 To run it, run it 
 You gotta show me 
 If you with it be a bad girl 
 When I step to the floor I'm fresh low key (low key) 
 When I step through the door all eyes on me (on me) 
 Wanna be a star get on TV 
 It's bout to jump off in my car so come with me (hey girl)
