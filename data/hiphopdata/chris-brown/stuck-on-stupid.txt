Am I crazy? Am I foolish? 
 Just a little too into you 
 That's for sure 
 (Ooh babe) 
 But your beauty, 
 That is in me 
 Makes me forget about your faults 
 You do no wrong 
 Ooh whoa ooh oh hoh oh 
 They say everybody plays the fool sometimes 
 And if I got to, 
 I don't mind 
 I'll be the best damn fool for you, 
 No lie 
 And girl I lose it every time 
 There's something about you, baby 
 And I swear that it drives me crazy 
 I'm stuck on you baby, 
 Stuck on you baby 
 And I might need help, 
 'Cause I can't think of nothing else 
 You got me stuck on stupid, 
 Stuck on stupid for you 
 Look what you do to me 
 It's confusing, 
 How you do it 
 It's like you take my heart and glue it to your soul, 
 Yeah baby 
 And I'll do anything for you, 
 Ooh you know that much it's true 
 Girl I'm so in love, 
 I'm stupid 
 They say everybody plays the fool sometimes 
 And if I got to, 
 I don't mind 
 I'll be the best damn fool for you, 
 No lie 
 And girl I lose it every time 
 There's something about you, baby 
 And I swear that it drives me crazy 
 I'm stuck on you baby, 
 Stuck on you baby 
 And I might need help, 
 'Cause I can't think of nothing else 
 You got me stuck on stupid, 
 Stuck on stupid for you 
 Ooh ooh ooh 
 Look what you do to me 
 If you told me to go rock climbing 
 To prove my love to you 
 You know I would've died trying 
 Got everything to lose 
 I'm gon' try to play it cool 
 The stupid things I do, 
 I do it for you 
 There's something about you, baby 
 And I swear that it drives me crazy 
 I'm stuck on you baby, 
 Stuck on you baby 
 And I might need help, 
 'Cause I can't think of nothing else 
 You got me stuck on stupid, 
 Stuck on stupid for you 
 Look what you do to me
