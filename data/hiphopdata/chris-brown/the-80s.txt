When the sun goes down 
 Record reblown, the horizon comes to life 
 Blue electric eye 
 The feeling that haunts me keeps me up at night 
 Do you know where do we go 
 When we're both stuck in the cold? 
 City lights, they wait in the dark 
 So if the feeling's nice, we'll never say goodbye 
 We'll just replay the 80s, go to a place where we can hide 
 Only your love can save me 
 I'm lost in a world of yellow skies, your paradise, paradise 
 When the rain falls down 
 Watch me clean, baptized up in your love, ay 
 Many dreams are found 
 Pulling me deeper, deeper to the light so 
 Do you know where do we go 
 When we're both stuck in the cold? 
 City lights, they wait in the dark 
 So if the feeling's nice, we'll never say goodbye 
 We'll just replay the 80s, go to a place where we can hide 
 Only your love can save me 
 I'm lost in a world of yellow skies, your paradise, paradise 
 This is nostalgic 
 This is our journey so don't stop believing 
 And you know that I got this 
 Constantly playing, oh let me going back in time 
 So if the feeling's nice, we'll never say goodbye 
 We'll just replay the 80s, go to a place where we can hide 
 Only your love can save me 
 I'm lost in a world of yellow skies, your paradise, paradise 
 So if the feeling's nice, we'll never say goodbye 
 We'll just replay the 80s, go to a place where we can hide 
 Only your love can save me 
 I'm lost in a world of yellow skies, your paradise, paradise 
 Back to the 80s, when music was your life 
 We can have the greatest time 
 Back to the 80s, the perfect time 
 We're back in time
