*Coughs* 
 Yeah, love 
 You don't know how I feel 
 Since you've been gone 
 Easy fall, I should've let go 
 'Cause everybody knows about you 
 Everybody knows about you 
 Everybody knows about you 
 Everybody knows about you 
 And they shouldn't fucking know about you 
 You ain't used to know about nothing (oh no) 
 You were just a girl from the subs (subs) 
 You was with the three plate threeway (three) 
 How you 'posed to know 'bout love? (Love) 
 Hoes on hoes every day (every day) 
 How you think I slipped up? (Slipped) 
 All this he say, she say (he, he, he) 
 Damn it, I had enough 
 Put you in the crib, that wasn't enough 
 Let you hit the mall and run that shit up 
 I'm the first one to put you in a foreign 
 Before me, you wasn't important 
 Now you actin' like you earned it 
 Go and smile for the camera 
 I hope that all this shit was worth it 
 I hope that all this shit was worth it, yeah 
 You don't know how I feel (you don't know) 
 Since you've been gone (you've been gone) 
 Easy fall, I should've let go (I should've let go) 
 'Cause everybody knows about you (knows about you) 
 Everybody knows about you 
 Everybody knows about you 
 Everybody knows about you 
 And they shouldn't fucking know about you 
 Got a nigga stuck on stupid 
 I'm thinking I really might lose it 
 Walking away, it ain't easy 
 Leaving you is like leaving my music 
 Your homegirl's in my business 
 They're the same ones liking my pictures 
 Telling you to leave, you can do better 
 But they ain't got no niggas 
 Put you in the crib, that wasn't enough 
 Let you hit the mall and run that shit up 
 I'm the first one to put you in a foreign 
 Before me, you wasn't important 
 Now you actin' like you earned it 
 Go and smile for the camera 
 I hope that all this shit was worth it 
 I hope that all this shit was worth it, yeah 
 You don't know how I feel (you don't know) 
 Since you've been gone (you've been gone) 
 Easy fall, I should've let go (I should've let go) 
 'Cause everybody knows about you (knows about you) 
 Everybody knows about you 
 Everybody knows about you 
 Everybody knows about you 
 And they shouldn't fucking know about you
