When you cuss me out, you don't mean that shit 
 I keep her looking good, my bitch clean as shit 
 Baby girl, I love you, I mean that shit 
 From the bottom of my heart, see me bleeding tears 
 You the type to take my charge, show up at my case 
 When she drive my car, she see the stars in the Wraith 
 She be out of line but she know her place 
 In the morning look at her face 'cause I don't fuck with makeup 
 And you know I love you 
 No matter, I'm right here waiting for you 
 It ain't 'bout the money, it ain't about the fame 
 It ain't 'bout the chase and it ain't about the games 
 You play hard to get 
 Baby, I just need you like you need me 
 Falling head over heels for you is easy 
 Ooh, I love your name, I hope you feel the same 
 She said she wanna chill, well come over later (yeah) 
 Don't worry about us, send the driver to come get you, baby 
 No, you don't wanna be lonely, do me a favor (yeah) 
 When we making love, you better put it all on me, on me 
 Put it on me every single time, on me 
 That pussy mine, yeah (you better put it all on me) 
 Put it on me every single time, on me 
 That pussy mine (you better put it all on me) 
 Look at my neck, cashin' the check 
 She fly to seein' me, hop on the jet 
 Now she on the west, yeah, that's my baby 
 Pussy makin' me crazy, yeah, the pussy the best 
 I love the way that she moan 
 And when she get excited when I go down low 
 And I just might dive in, that pussy is flowing 
 And I ain't scared to down in it if the water is yours 
 She said she wanna chill, well come over later (yeah) 
 Don't worry about us, send the driver to come get you, baby 
 No, you don't wanna be lonely, do me a favor (yeah) 
 When we making love, you better put it all on me, on me 
 Put it on me every single time, on me 
 That pussy mine, yeah (you better put it all on me) 
 Put it on me every single time, on me 
 That pussy mine (you better put it all on me) 
 She said she wanna chill, well come over later (yeah) 
 Don't worry about us, send the driver to come get you, baby 
 No, you don't wanna be lonely, do me a favor (yeah) 
 When we making love, you better put it all on me, on me 
 Put it on me every single time, on me 
 That pussy mine, yeah (you better put it all on me) 
 Put it on me every single time, on me 
 That pussy mine (you better put it all on me)
