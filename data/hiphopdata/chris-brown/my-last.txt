Hands up in the air 
 I just want the 
 I just want the baddest bitch in the world 
 Right here on my lap 
 And I'mma hit this drink up like it's my last 
 I'mma I'mma hit this night up like it's my last 
 I'mma I'mma hit this ass up like it's my last 
 Swear I'mma, swear I'mma do it like 
 Like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all 
 Like I like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all 
 Okay, now where that alcohol 
 You ain't even got to ask 
 'Cause I'mma drink it all like, like it's my last 
 She a seven in the face, but a ten in the ass 
 She even look better by the end of my glass 
 See I just walked in fresher than the shirts off in this mu'fucka' 
 Ima need a baddest broad to twirk off in this motherfucka' 
 I'mma go hard till it hurts off in this motherfucka' 
 I'mma ball so you gotta work off in this motherfucka' 
 The work, and I can get you anything you want 
 I could, I could, I could put you on 
 See you look like Beyonce so do it like Beyon 
 Do it like Beyonce and put it on Sean 
 Grind hard but a got a lot to show for it 
 Always had drive like I had to chauffeur it 
 My team's so true we should get a camera crew 
 To follow us around and make a show for us 
 And I'mma hit this drink up like it's my last 
 I'mma I'mma hit this night up like it's my last 
 I'mma I'mma hit this ass up like it's my last 
 Swear I'mma, swear I'mma do it like 
 Like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all 
 Like I like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all 
 Now, I'mma fill this glass up like it's my last 
 I'mma I'mma blow this bag up like it's my last 
 I'mma spend this cash up like it's my last 
 And I'mma make it last, like it's my last 
 And I'm gone, can't remember where I am 
 But she forget about her man when they tell her who I am 
 And they introduce my fan 
 Now she all up in space 
 All all up in my face like you remember who I am 
 Since I signed to Kan', I'm Louie Vuitton Sean 
 Up in Benny Han Han eating all the wontons 
 Rose rose over a little Chandon 
 Put her hands down my pants now she rocking Sean John 
 Man I just ended up on everybody guest list 
 I'm just doing better than what erry'one projected 
 Knew that I'd be here so if you asked me how I feel 
 I'mma just tell you, its everything that I expected Bitch 
 Hands up in the air 
 (One time for the West side, let me see them hands) 
 Hands up in the air 
 (Two times if you love Good Music) 
 Hands up in the air 
 (And three times for the baddest chick in the world 
 Who got her hands up in the air) 
 Hands up in the air 
 And I'mma hit this drink up like it's my last 
 I'mma I'mma hit this night up like it's my last 
 I'mma I'mma hit this ass up like it's my last 
 Swear I'mma, swear I'mma do it like 
 Like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all 
 Like I like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all 
 Big ass bottles, 
 Big ice buckets 
 I work too hard to be ballin' on a budget 
 Me and my people do it big out in public cause 
 'Cause if you don't do it big, bitch you ain't doing nothing 
 And I'mma hit this drink up like it's my last 
 I'mma I'mma hit this night up like it's my last 
 I'mma I'mma hit this ass up like it's my last (boi) 
 Swear I'mma, swear I'mma do it like 
 Like I like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all 
 Like I like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all 
 All all all all, all all all all 
 Like I like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all
