Had an epiphany, and this what it seems 
 These smoking mirrors don't wanna believe 
 For far too long they've been plottin on me 
 The stories unfolding now, it's a conspiracy 
 Starting to feel like a deja vu 
 I remember being here, must be a glitch in the matrix 
 Look around they all got the same face on 
 I'm standing by the phone someone call me 
 Bring me to life, show me how to live 
 'Cause I lose control, feeling like Neo 
 In the matrix, I just wanna live 
 I just wanna live oh whoa 
 I took a red and a blue pill, now I 
 Can't decide what's make believe or real 
 Am I awake or am I still asleep? 
 It's killing me, 
 Until the oracle I wanted to know 
 What I was supposed to do, she said I see on my own 
 And the craziest thing is that you already know 
 How to decipher the signs on the side of the road oh whoa 
 Starting to feel like a deja vu 
 I remember being here, must be a glitch in the matrix 
 Look around they all got the same face on 
 I'm standing by the phone someone call me 
 Bring me to life, show me how to live 
 'Cause I lose control, feeling like Neo 
 In the matrix, I just wanna live 
 I just wanna live oh whoa 
 I took a red and a blue pill, now I can't decide what's make believe or real 
 Am I awake or am I still asleep? 
 It's killing me 
 I need you, you gotta help me 
 I'm part human, part android 
 I need your power so you can't judge me 
 Judge me, oh whoa stuck in the matrix 
 Oh bring me to life 
 Bring me to life, show me how to live 
 'Cause I lose control, feeling like Neo 
 In the matrix, I just wanna live 
 I just wanna live oh whoa
