Sweetheart, 
 When the sunlight's on your face, now. 
 Hope that fate can have it's way today 
 Sweetheart, 
 It's like I'm drifting on a star 
 Know you're in a rush and my love's on the way, ay, ay. 
 And I love that you are everything I want 
 And if you need anything from me 
 You can just ask me! 
 'Cause your touch does something to me, baby 
 'Cause you're my greatest gift, 
 I seal it with a kiss 
 And I just wanna tell you that you are sweetheart, is what you are 
 I said a sweetheart is what you are (you are wonderful) 
 Sweetheart is what you are 
 Sweetheart! 
 Sweetheart! 
 If I could take all 
 The girls around the world 
 And put 'em in a room, oh ah. 
 None of them could compare to you. 
 And I put together all the pieces 
 The only thing that's missing 
 Is you, yeah, is you, yeah 
 And I love that you are everything I want 
 And if you need anything from me 
 You can just ask me! 
 'Cause your touch does something to me, baby 
 'Cause you're my greatest gift, 
 I seal it with a kiss 
 And I just wanna tell you that you are sweetheart, is what you are 
 I said a sweetheart is what you are (you are wonderful) 
 Sweetheart is what you are (Oh-na-na) (Oh-na-na) 
 Sweetheart! 
 Sweetheart! 
 Band in your hair, 
 With the scent of your perfume, girl 
 Nothing compares 
 To you, to you babe! 
 And I'm in paradise 
 You look so good in my eyes! 
 And I have her eyes right in front of me 
 You not, you not 
 But you are the real thing 
 Hands up 
 For your love 
 If you really really love somebody 
 Hands up 
 For your love 
 If you really really love somebody 
 I said put hands up, for your love 
 If you really really love somebody 
 Now I can see there's more to what you are 
 Baby, you are sweetheart, is what you are 
 I said a sweetheart is what you are (you are wonderful) 
 Sweetheart is what you are 
 Sweetheart! 
 Sweetheart! 
 Band in your hair 
 With the scent of your perfume, girl 
 Nothing compares 
 To you, to you! 
 And I'm in paradise 
 You look so good in my eyes! 
 And I have her eyes right in front of me 
 You are the real thing!
