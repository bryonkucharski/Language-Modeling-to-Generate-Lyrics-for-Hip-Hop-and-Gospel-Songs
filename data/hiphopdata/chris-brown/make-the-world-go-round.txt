Lace in Macy's don't have it 
 A hatred addict 
 I need faces mad with frowns 
 When I'm around 
 Or I'm wasting the fabric 
 I don't feel greater 
 To my plush pieces 
 'Cause you to suck your teeth 
 So mean-mugging on my clean-thugging 
 Mean nothing 
 Women dream I'm your husband 
 I'm Alex Pushkin 
 The black poetry-writing Russian 
 Ice disgusting 
 I started bling 
 How could you question my direction 
 Or my time for collection 
 Gangstas two-steppin' 
 You hate me 
 Should thank me 
 But lately 
 I burned so much trees 
 I keep environmentalists angry 
 I'm a rare dude, I'm a wonder 
 Your best success is my worst blunder 
 Y'all living trendy on pennies 
 I cop plenty Fendi 
 Vivienne Westwood, I'm good 
 Get the whole Trump Tower top floor for the hood 
 Dre and Cool, we riding heavy 
 And why to Miami? 'Cause ... 
 (We make the world go round) 
 Now let's toast to the hustlers 
 (We make the world go round) 
 Tell the hustlers, toast to the gangstas. 
 (We make the world go round) 
 Tell the gangstas, toast to the ballers 
 (We make the world go round) 
 And tell the ballers pour glass for all us. 
 (We make the world go round) 
 I see you haters on the floor jockin' my swag 
 I'm popping Ralph Lauren tags 
 I'm pouring champagne inside a polo glass 
 Model bitches rollin' grass 
 Escabon folding cash 
 Toasting wit my entourage 
 Went for Robin Armitage 
 To all my stars 
 Red carpet to the Larmitage 
 We throwin' red dice 
 At the Mirage 
 I pull that red Lamborghini 
 Or twenties out my garage 
 Instead of shopping South Beach like and Terror Squad 
 We the Best! big pippin 
 Top down chrome spinnin 
 Top Gun Tom Cruise 
 Tucked inside my Gucci linen 
 Nope 
 Jess Romo you tryin' a shine 
 Up on with the nine 
 On your jersey for promo 
 Jessica Simpson that's so-so 
 Nick warner's (baby back) 
 Wit that lo so. 
 Devil white 
 5-0 they catch me at the pro bowl on the field diamonds 
 Choking the jockey on my polo 
 CB let 'em know though 
 We make the world go round From my town to your town 
 We on top no stopping us now 
 We got patron to ballers two steppin 
 Ladies on the float and all in two steppin 
 From Malay to Harlem two stepping (echo) 
 So I' stop 'cause we made it where the ladies are 
 We start with Bellini's and end with Patron shots 
 H. Lorenzo belt buckle from Chrome Heart 
 A-life tag popper 
 It'd be sad not to walk out the store with bags 
 Worth a 100 cash, shopping 
 Balance only would have to 
 Have to swell you up 
 Before a pea snaps as you wet a vanilla dutch 
 Mets cap, that's Queens, I'm a vet 
 Bet that, 300 carats the average up on the neck, black 
 Paid the cost, be the boss, Black Caesar floss 
 Weekends at the Venetian, pull up in that black Porsche 
 Top down, new fashion 
 Seeing me is like seeing through the lens of Helmut Newton's camera 
 Light flashing, 
 And I'm laughin' 
 My plaque's from album sales 
 Y'all is ringtone platinum 
 But .99 cents adds up 
 I don't hate 'em, I congratulate 'em 
 The new young Prince with young Mike Jackson on the same track, what! 
 Now let's toast to the hustlers
