Let me start off by saying 
 Baby don't go both ways 
 She don't mind flirting and playing 
 At least that's what she say 
 Got off in the spot 
 And I'm tripping 
 She knows baby girl's first name 
 Could it be something I'm missing 
 Or am I just part of the game 
 Whoa whoa 
 She getting more change than the players 
 Whoa whoa 
 She putting fingers up to the haters 
 Whoa whoa 
 Way she do it it look so good 
 Like I said she don't go both ways 
 But this is making me wish she would 
 My girl like them girls 
 It's all right it's okay 
 My girl like them girls 
 It's all right it's okay 
 So I let her let her do her thing 
 I even let her make it rain 
 My girl like them girls 
 She like them girls 
 Oh yeah 
 Didn't know that she liked them girls 
 Didn't know she... 
 Number one fantasy on my list 
 I even did it once in my dream 
 Ooh that damn Minaj 
 Could it really be happening 
 Baby how you gon' tease me 
 Tucking dollars all between your thighs 
 Ooh that girl got it 
 You should make an exception tonight 
 Whoa whoa 
 She getting more change than the players 
 Whoa whoa 
 She putting fingers up to the haters 
 Whoa whoa 
 Way she do it it look so good 
 Like I said she don't go both ways 
 But this is making me wish she would 
 Yeah... 
 My girl like them girls 
 It's all right it's okay 
 My girl like them girls 
 It's all right it's okay 
 So I let her let her do her thing 
 I even let her make it rain 
 My girl like them girls 
 She like them girls 
 Oh yeah 
 Didn't know that she liked them girls 
 Didn't know she... 
 She liked the one with the tattooed thighs 
 I think they call her Sunshine 
 And if she wanna cross the light 
 I don't care 
 'Cause ain't nobody gotta know 
 And we can keep it on the low 
 And if you wanna take her home 
 We can share...
