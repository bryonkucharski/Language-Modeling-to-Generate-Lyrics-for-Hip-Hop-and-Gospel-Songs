You look, so good

 Women like you steal my control 
 Scene of the crime 
 My spot is next door 
 Come on (girl) 
 Girl don't (girl don't) be scared (be scared) 
 Now baby 
 Help me, help me, help me 
 I want you to help me help me help me 
 I can't stop myself 
 You have been lovely 
 I wanna have you screaming 
 Love you roughly 
 I need a little bit of help 
 Keep raising the body count 
 When ever I take 'em out 
 I end up taking 'em down 
 Can you help me, help me, help me? 
 Shoot me or something 
 Help me, help me, help me 
 Do me or something
