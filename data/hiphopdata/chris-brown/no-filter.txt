I swear I got no filter, no filter 
 I swear I got no filter, no filter 
 This juice got me loose, ain't no use in holding 
 Tell me something on your mind 
 Slurring words, it's got a mind of its own 
 When I'm on one, when I'm on one, I'm really on one, I'm really on one 
 I got a limo round my waist, put that milkshake in my face 
 Girl we fuck the night away 
 Lick your lips, girl that's my taste 
 When I'm on one, when I'm on one, I'm really on one, I'm really on one 
 When I see that ooh I just might 
 Why is it so wrong if it feels right? 
 I swear I got no filter, no filter 
 I swear I got no filter, no filter 
 I'm out of fucks to give 
 I got no filter, no filer 
 I'm out of fucks to give 
 Put you on now with no filter 
 You know I don't give a fuck, ha 
 King bed in my room tell me cause it can improve 
 Let me get you slip and sliding 
 Skinny dipping, scuba wilding 
 When I'm on one, when I'm on one, I'm really on one, I'm really on one 
 I see that donk, tasty romp 
 And it make me wanna hump 
 All night, all night, I just gotta go all night 
 When I'm on one yeah, dripping on one, I'm really on one, I'm really on one 
 When I see that ooh I just might 
 Why is it so wrong if it feels right? 
 I swear I got no filter, no filter 
 I swear I got no filter, no filter 
 I'm out of fucks to give 
 I got no filter, no filer 
 I'm out of fucks to give 
 Put you on now with no filter 
 Juice got me loose, ain't no use in holding 
 Juice got me loose, but I gotta go all night 
 When I'm on one, when I'm on one 
 When I'm on one, when I'm on one 
 When I see that ooh I just might 
 Why is it so wrong if it feels right? 
 I swear I got no filter, I wanna eat that pussy, no filter 
 I swear I got no filter, no filter 
 I'm out of fucks to give 
 I got no filter, no filer 
 I'm out of fucks to give 
 Put you on now with no filter 
 Ooh I just might 
 Why is it so wrong if it feels right? 
 Lick your lips, girl that's my taste 
 When I'm on one
