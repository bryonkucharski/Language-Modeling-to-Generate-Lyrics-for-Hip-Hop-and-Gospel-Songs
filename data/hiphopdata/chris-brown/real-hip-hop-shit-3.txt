Leather jacket, relaxing 
 The movie scenes I'm acting 
 These rappers practice 
 I'm at the plate, enough to bat bitch 
 Fully smoking locomotive, nigga, fuck an adlib 
 In the club celebrating 'cause I'm self promoted 
 Is it a fire? Cause the crowd smoking! 
 Big Will, she off a pill... rollin' 
 You know a country nigga hungry 
 Waffle house? Open! 
 But they too broke to pay their bills 
 So they're freeloading 
 But it's cool, sit down 
 You know that nigga rich? 
 Girl his name... Chris Brown 
 His chain's so ugly that it makes a bitch frown 
 I'm serving all these niggas 
 But who ordered hash browns? 
 Nigga, I be like... yeah I got the check 
 And I just paid your bills, so... yes 
 I want some sex 
 Hah! But first, can I kiss your neck? 
 And I'mma work you out 
 So you ain't gotta stretch 
 Hold up! Let me slow up 
 Impregnate your beat, I make that bitch blow up 
 I eat all I can eat 
 Until a nigga throw up 
 I tell that DJ "ay! Pull up, pull up" 
 Man, I'm so sick of these lame motherfuckas 
 A nigga's still shitting on the game, motherfucka 
 Old niggas as the world change, muthafuckas 
 Y'all niggas still being the same muthafucka? 
 Who else, dawg? 
 Look, let me go in, then I count more ends 
 My tints 11, and your friends in my Benz 
 The engine on that Viper 220 
 And it's green in the trunk, but that's new money 
 Watch... Frank Mueller, my Ruger 
 Cut that shit - fire. I just shot my jeweler! 
 Another hundred racks just to make my chain a cooler 
 Off that Four Loco, out of my medulla 
 Wow! I be seeing dead people 
 Dead prezzies my besties 
 Nigga, we are not equal 
 How you get the big picture 
 Looking from a peephole? 
 My real niggas in the back, but 
 "He ain't talking to me tho!" 
 I know you mad 'cause I afford it 
 TMZ, I'm wiping my ass, so stop recording 
 Supposedly a singer, can't do hip-hop 
 But I just killed this shit, so let the 
 Shit rock
