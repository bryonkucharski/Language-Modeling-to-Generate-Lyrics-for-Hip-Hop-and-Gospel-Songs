Look, in the summer 6-0 
 A little margarita blend 
 So I slip slow 
 The type of nigga I am kind of skitzo 
 Never out of my element I let the fifth go 
 Shots in the club panic at the disco 
 She of that M D M A that's from Frisco 
 Hella chips call me mister Nabisco 
 Is that your bitch 'cause she 
 Won't let my go wrist go 
 My techniques is just sex freaks 
 Skinny dip with hot model bitches and lesbies 
 I'm a put my tongue on they soul like a SB 
 But they don't know they scum to my soul they're just sexy 
 I'm a play dumb play that role in the 
 SV is ridiculous 
 And can I get a girl with real ass and tits 
 Most respect in the world to my 
 Real niggas 'cause, all them fake niggas make me 
 Wanna kill niggas, I stand alone fuck that gang bang shit! 
 They Nintendo blowing niggas 
 'Cause this game ain't shit 
 Is relevant that I am better than these 'veterans' 
 They are sleeping on me like I been 
 Given them sedatives 
 Sometimes I wish I had better 
 Friends and better peers 
 'Cause I know when it to the ends they disappear... 
 Damn! Where they go? Where they go? Where they go? 
 Uh-See I'm doper than that shit 
 Pookie was on in new jack city 
 This is why I'm getting rich 
 Without trying 
 I ain't like fifty 
 'Cause what's good being rich if your dying 
 That shit is silly! 
 Call the the chain TLC all the ice make you chilly 
 I'm a pimp so you know I'm snatching your broad 
 I'm a a real star, you're Patrick from SpongeBob 
 And in my city to the streets I'm Freeway Ricky 
 'Cause I keep the streets flooded with that crack music 
 I be selling CDs like them niggas push kilos 
 But I don't push weight unless there's plates 
 In the weight room 
 Why you think I'm BUF? Blowin' Up Fast 
 Call me left hook 'cause I be heavy on the gas 
 You would think I was a Spartan, 300 on the dash 
 Either that or a martian in a space aircraft 
 'Cause when you see that whip that I have, you be like "What the fuck was that?! "
