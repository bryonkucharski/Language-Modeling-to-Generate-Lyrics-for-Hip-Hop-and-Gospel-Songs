 Loving you like I do, someone that's there for you 
 Don't judge ya 'cause I know we only human 
 I must be stupid babe, letting you slip away

 If you show me all your flaws, I'll show you mine 
 I'll claim your baggage, you no longer need to hide

 I wish that you could see you like I see you 
 It's like that you're no good, you're just misunderstood

 Them boys ain't like this man, can't love you like I can
