 Baby I gotta have you girl 
 Lemme get it when I get it if I get it I'ma kill it 
 Baby when you get it we be rolling on the floor like 
 Baby you so gifted when you kissing on my lips 
 Then when we switchin the position you ain't ever gotta slow down 
 I can be the, be the lover of ya life 
 I just wanna be under the covers for the night, 
 Take a look around, put your hands in the air like the ceilings falling down 
 Take a chance with me, girl you know that I won't do you no harm 
 Oh my love, you got my heart, heart, heart
