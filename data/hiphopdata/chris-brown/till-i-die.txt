(Chris Brown) 
 Yo, this Virginia 
 Straight from the country, right there wit' my kinfolk 
 Golds in my mouth and they put 26's on Benzo's 
 Dirt roads, back woods 
 They got weed but I've been dope 
 Ratchet, nigga we act hood 
 But I'm getting money with these white folk 
 Sippin' and I'm faded, super medicated 
 Said she wanna check the pole 
 I said "Okay Sarah Palin," so I lay down and lay in 
 A nigga gon' be faded, all the way to the AM yeah 
 (Big Sean) 
 More drink, pour it up 
 More weed, roll it up 
 Whoa there hoe, you know what's up 
 Quit hoggin' the blunt bitch, slow down 
 Pimps up, hoes down 
 Ass up, nose down 
 Damn, bitch I do it 
 And this the life we chose 
 Workin' all night 
 Swear I'm never going broke 
 And imma do this till I die 
 And I ain't talking shit just 'cause I'm, just 'cause I'm... 
 (I'm high) 
 Oh God, oh God 
 Okay, wow, bow 
 Look at me now, chief like an Indian 
 Talkin' in clouds, I'm high as a bitch 
 I'm talking to clouds 
 Off tree every night like I roam with the owls 
 I super soak that hoe, show 'em no love just throw 'em a towel 
 Still rocking Louis Vuitton condom, 'cause I'm so fucking in style, wow 
 New crib, crash that, Drove here, cab back 
 Now knock that pussy out, yeah that's just a little catnap 
 Hold up, hold up whoa 
 Don't be smoking my shit, I be smoking that fire 
 And she be smoking my dick 
 More drink, pour it up 
 More weed, roll it up 
 Whoa there hoe, you know what's up 
 Quit hoggin' the blunt bitch, slow down 
 Pimps up, hoes down 
 Ass up, nose down 
 Damn bitch I do it 
 And this the life we chose 
 Workin' all night 
 Swear I'm never going broke 
 And imma do this till I die 
 And I ain't talking shit just 'cause I'm, just 'cause I'm... 
 (I'm high) 
 (Wiz Khalifa) 
 Smoking, choking, always rollin' something 
 I don't need a key to start my car 
 Bitch I just push a button and theater showing 
 Got a half a mill and spent it like it's nothing 
 Money flowing, never sober 
 Smoking till I got concussions, no discussions 
 Man I got a condo and got a big crib 
 Pounds all over my kitchen is 
 If I ain't on the road gettin' it 
 Then I'm in the hood where my niggas live 
 Did a tour, sold it out, just bought a pound 'bout to finish it 
 Now all my pasta got shrimp in it 
 You talk about it and I'm living it 
 Fucking little bitch 
 (Big Sean) 
 More drink, pour it up 
 More weed, roll it up 
 Whoa there hoe, you know what's up 
 Quit hoggin' the blunt bitch, slow down 
 Pimps up, hoes down 
 Ass up, nose down 
 Damn bitch I do it 
 And this the live we chose 
 Workin' all night 
 Swear I'm never going broke 
 And imma do this till I die 
 And I ain't talking shit just 'cause I'm, just 'cause I'm... 
 (I'm high) 
 (Chris Brown) 
 Real nigga never frontin' 
 'Cause when you got it all 
 Everybody want somethin' 
 Middle finger in the air no fist pump 
 And me, Sean and Wiz got this bitch jumping 
 Ah! Finally got this bitch jumping 
 Got this bitch jumpin' 
 Fly, that's me.
