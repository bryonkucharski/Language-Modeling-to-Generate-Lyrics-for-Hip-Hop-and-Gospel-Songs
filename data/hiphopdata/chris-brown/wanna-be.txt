[Sigh] Look. I know we've been friends for a while now. 
 But, I just feel like I can confess to you. 
 It's gonna be hard but. 
 All right here it goes... 
 Imagine that the pillow that you cried on was my chest, 
 And the tissue that you wiped your face with was my hand. 
 Girl, imagine: if you needed advise about some other guy, I'm the one that comes to mind. 
 Not tryna hear you tell nobody that I'm just a friend, 
 Just trying to make sure I'm that body that you call your man, 
 And anytime you need a shoulder -- it's yours, night or day, 
 But what I'm tryna say is, I wanna be... 
 The last number you call late at night (said I wanna be), 
 The first one that you dial when you open your eyes. 
 Wanna be the one you run to, 
 Wanna be the one that ain't gonna hurt you, 
 I wanna be yeah, I wanna be yeah... 
 Be the man making your girl jealous, 
 Be the guy shuttin' down all the fellas... 
 Whatever you need, girl, it's all on me: 
 Soldier, your friend or your lover, girl, 
 I wanna be... 
 Would it be cool? 
 Would you mind if I called you my boo, 
 What if the next whip you was pushin' was the one I bought for you? 
 Can I be the one that meets your pops and take your mama shoppin', be the only one they like? 
 Have you thought about it -- wait -- really thought about it? 
 Maybe you should take some time 
 Call your girls and talk about it, yeah. 
 'Cause I done already made up my mind, 
 Don't need no more time to know if I wanna be with you, 
 I wanna be... 
 Put me on your screen saver, all over your myspace and make me one of your top favorites, 
 That's where I wanna be... 
 The one you cryin' for (stand up for and fightin' for) 
 Wanna be your good, bad, love, hate girl... 
 (x2) 
 Cross my heart hoped to die, on everything that's good, 
 I'm gonna do you right, show you right, get this understood. 
 Girl I wanna be, I wanna be... [sigh] 
 I wanna be, I wanna be...
