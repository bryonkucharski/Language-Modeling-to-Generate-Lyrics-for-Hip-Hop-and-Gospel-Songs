(Chris Brown:) 
 Say she coming over late night with some bad bitches 
 Told her, "Baby have your whole team ready" 
 I done got so high on the Miley Cyrus 
 I just need some codeine just to relax 
 This the new vivy and millennium, wavy 
 We don't talk as much as we used to, lately 
 Send a text through forever, my lady 
 You done kept it true from the day that you met me 
 I don't want to get you to ruin your new relations 
 Showin' tough love, baby, how the streets made me 
 Bye bye, baby, goin' bye bye 
 Had her on the sidelines, now she goin' bye bye 
 Used to come through, hit it, pull off like a drive-by 
 Then she got that pool on her so I know her new guy 
 Nigga had to tie the knot, know that nigga tied the knot 
 I just had her put up in a penthouse like a jackpot 
 Same young niggas servin' junkies out the crack spot 
 Take some well known pussy, eat it 'til she pass out 
 Take the stripper, smoke some Keisha with her, then cash out 
 Still a doughboy so I'm walkin' with the bands out 
 Take the Dom Pérignon, told 'em gon' carry on 
 Keep the shit a trillion, and I wanna take the time to get to know you like I should've did my last one 
 For my new one, for my new one, for my new jump, baby gon' 
 Bye bye, baby, goin' bye bye 
 Had her on the sidelines, now she goin' bye bye 
 Used to come through, hit it, pull off like a drive-by 
 Then she got that pool on her so I know her new guy 
 Nigga had to tie the knot, know that nigga tied the knot 
 I just had her put up in a penthouse like a jackpot 
 Same young niggas servin' junkies out the crack spot 
 Take some well known pussy, eat it 'til she pass out 
 Take the stripper, smoke some Keisha with her, then crash out 
 (Future:) 
 You did it, you made me a better person 
 You did it, you did it 
 You made me a better person 
 You did it, you did it, you did it 
 Shawty comin' over late night with some bad bitches 
 Told baby, "Have the whole team ready" 
 Balled so hard last night 
 Baby called back, say she wanna have another replay 
 You enjoyed the moment that you should've spit your game 
 On the thing, man I should've, started hangin' 'round the gang 
 She the truest 
 Put her hands out and bomb, she the truest 
 Make me pull up with the funds, I'll do it 
 Support you once, and again I'll do it 
 You want that brand new Benz, I'll do it 
 You ain't ever got the time, what you doin'? 
 You ain't ever did complain when we do it 
 Now you actin' real strange when we do it 
 Want your girls on girls when we did it 
 You ain't ever put the world in our business 
 You see me, fall in love, I'm the realest 
 You see me give the game to you, had to read about it on the blogs 
 Accepted me like a jail call, baby gon' 
 Baby, goin' bye bye 
 Had her on the sidelines, now she goin' bye bye 
 Used to come through, hit it, pull off like a drive-by 
 Then she got that pool on her so I know her new guy 
 Nigga had to tie the knot, know that nigga tied the knot 
 I just had her put up in a penthouse like a jackpot 
 Same young niggas servin' junkies out the crack spot 
 Take some well known pussy, eat it 'til she pass out 
 Take the stripper, smoke some Keisha with her, then crash out 
 You did it 
 You made me a better person 
 You did it, you did it 
 You made me a better person 
 You did it, you did it, you did it
