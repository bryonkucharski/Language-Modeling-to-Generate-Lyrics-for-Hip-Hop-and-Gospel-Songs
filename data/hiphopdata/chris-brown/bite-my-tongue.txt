It's getting hard to bite my tongue 
 Making me feel so dumb 
 Can't explain it, feel so numb 
 So let me think about it, um, 'bout it, 'bout it 
 Ooh, ooh, I'm thinking how to say 
 Ooh, ooh, a million different ways 
 Ooh, ooh, I'm thinking how to say 
 Let's get up out this place, yeah 
 I promise I won't bite my tongue 
 Oh woah, ha 
 I promise I won't bite my tongue, hey, hey 
 Oh woah, hey, hey 
 Girl, I'm not tryna kiss and run 
 I shoot it off like a gun 
 Bang, bang, I would kill for you, I live for the thrill of you, mmm 
 And I'ma not tryna do you wrong 
 Ooh, ooh, I'm thinking how to say (ooh, ooh, to say, say, oh na na na na) 
 Ooh, ooh, a million different ways (ways) 
 Ooh, ooh, I'm thinking how to say (say, yeah) 
 Let's get up out this place, yeah 
 We can take it London to LA, hey, hey 
 I promise I won't bite my tongue, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey 
 Oh woah, hey, hey, oh woah, hey, hey, hey 
 Oh woah, oh woah 
 Ooh, ooh 
 Ooh, ooh 
 Girl, I would kill for you, I live for the thrill of you, mmm 
 And I'ma not tryna do you wrong 
 Baby, I promise not to bite my tongue 
 Ooh, woah, woah, oh na na na, yeah 
 Bite my tongue, on you, baby 
 And I'm not tryna do you wrong
