The world is always changing, you can see it every day 
 But in a tragic situation you just can't hide yourself away 
 So try a little kindness cause it sure can't be that hard 
 You're shining in the darkness when you open up your heart 
 Your love is all we need to bring us together 
 Don't leave it to me, nothing's for free, it comes down to us 
 Hungry babies on television, can you feel the shame? 
 We've got to keep on giving to one another, 'cause it's all gonna happen again 
 Why don't you try a little kindness cause it sure can't be that hard 
 Just think about what binds us and find a new place to start 
 Your love is all we need to bring us together 
 Don't leave it to me, nothing's for free, it comes down to us 
 Your love is all we need to bring us together 
 We're not indestructable, we're some kind of miracle 
 Happens every day
