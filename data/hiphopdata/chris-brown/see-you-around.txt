You love another man 
 My heart is broken in two 
 She wears a ring on the other hand 
 She's scared to tell me the truth, but 
 If you are leaving 
 I want you to know that 
 I should've loved you way more 
 Way more 
 So this is the end of us now 
 I'll see you around 
 I'll see you around 
 Around 
 You mean more to me than anything 
 And it ends cause you don't love me 
 No, no, no, no 
 So I just wanna see you happy 
 Now that you are comfortable 
 I think that I am losing my mind 
 It's crazy 'cause we were so inseparable 
 Guess things change with time 
 Do he kiss and wipe away your tears? 
 Does he tell you that there's nothing to fear? 
 If I had a wishing well 
 I would have you right here, so girl 
 If you are leaving 
 Baby I want you to know that 
 I should've loved you way more 
 Way more 
 So if this is the end of us now 
 I'll see you around 
 I'll see you around 
 Around 
 You mean more to me than anything 
 And it ends cause you don't love me 
 No, no, no, no 
 So I just wanna see you happy 
 I didn't listen 
 You been missing 
 He has your heart now 
 I'm missing your kisses 
 Want it again 
 Don't leave me down 
 Wish I could keep you, all to myself 
 I wanna work it out 
 But you moved on, I see it now 
 Oh, guess I'll see you around
