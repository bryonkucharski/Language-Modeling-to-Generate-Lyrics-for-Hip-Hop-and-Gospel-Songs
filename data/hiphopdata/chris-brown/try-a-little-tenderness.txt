O she may be weary 
 Them young girls, they do get weary 
 Wearin that same old shaggy dress 
 O, when she gets weary, try a little Tenderness 
 You know she's waiting, just anticipating 
 For the things she'll never posses 
 While she's there waiting 
 Try, o just a little, o just a little little little tenderness 
 That's what I said, a little tenderness 
 It's' All you gotta do 
 It's not, ha, ooh just sentimental, no 
 She has, she has, she has 
 Her griefs and cares 
 But the soft words spoke so gentle, yeah 
 And it makes it easier, easier 
 To bare 
 You won't regret it no 
 Them young girls, they don't forget it 
 Love is their own, their own, happiness 
 But it's all, it's all, so simple now 
 All you gotta do is try a little tenderness 
 Won't you show her won't her, won't you show her that you love her 
 You wanna squeeze her, don't tease her, neva leave her 
 You got want to want to just try a little tenderness 
 You gotta show her that you want it, now one above her now 
 Squeeze her, don't tease her, neva leave her 
 Hold her, grab her softly now 
 And try a little tenderness 
 You ota listen to me, don't leave 
 Don't cheat her now 
 Squeeze her, don't cheat her, neva leave her 
 Gotta show her na na na heey hey! 
 You got to know what to do, don't be a fool 
 You need to try this now 
 Just try a little tenderness 
 Take it from me you don't wanna let her leave 
 Squeeze her, don't tease, neva leave 
 You got to want to try, juss try, juss try, a little tenderness 
 Is there a witness in the building tonight 
 You gotta want to want to try, just try a little tenderness 
 Try a little tenderness 
 Squeeze her, don't tease her, neva leave her 
 Hold her, grab her softly now 
 Just Try a little...
