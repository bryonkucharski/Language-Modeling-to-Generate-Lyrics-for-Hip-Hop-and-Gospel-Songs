(Chris Brown) 
 Yellow model chick 
 Yellow bottle sipping 
 Yellow Lamborghini 
 Yellow top missing 
 Yeah yeah 
 That sh-t look like a toupee 
 I get what you get in 10 years, in two days 
 Ladies love me 
 I'm on my cool J 
 If you get what I get what would you say 
 She wax it all off, Mr Miyagi 
 And them suicide doors, Hari Kari 
 Look at me now, look at me now 
 Oh, I'm getting paper 
 Look at me now 
 Oh, look at me now 
 Yeah, fresh than a muthaf-cker 
 Lil n-gga bigger than gorilla 
 'Cause I'm killing every n-gga that 
 Try to be on my sh-t 
 Better cuff your chick if you with her 
 I can get her 
 And she accidentally slip fall on my dick 
 Ooops, I said on my dick 
 I ain't really mean to say on my d-ck 
 But since we talking about my dick 
 All of you haters say hi to it 
 I'm Done 
 (Twista) 
 Now let a track go past like this and Twista not fuck with it, y'all done lost your mind 
 I could hit you with the auto-matic-flow, I could do any rhythm and any pattern 
 That I wanna do the harder that it go, you could see blood spilling out from a body 
 Right in front of you, and imma get the dough, now the way I be shinin be havin' everybody lookin' at me 
 Fuckin' them up when I buck up I step up and ball... I do a murder when I'm trigger happy like 
 I got the intricate power to kill her for currency when I'm be anna but imma be making 'em holler 
 'Cause I'm a kedavers when I'm attackin the beat I'm a scholar 'cause I'm a personification of god, 
 So you better honor (what!?) Mr. immaculate now I'm breakin it, marble sack your lyricist 
 I'll be here forever, haters wanna hate on me because they wanna hear whatever 
 I could spit a rhythm to a bitch and get her pussy wetter, 
 Pimpin' on a bitch and tell her I could get her pussy cheddar 
 So I get the camera wanna go and make a movie 
 Me up in the back on top to get the booty, didn't wanna show her face even though she was a cutie 
 Nine millimeter and spillin millions of milliliters of life out a nigga if he talk shit 
 C.E.O step into my office, comin' with the awkward flow like I'm sick 
 Go get your momma to bring a thermometer, my temperatures hot 
 Come up with a flow that would kill a industry, and I could pick anything that I want off the lot 
 Never compatible 'cause I be intricate, when I be servin' you, when I be doin' it, at a place 
 I know they can't leave me, think Twista could kill 'em on a track wit busta breezy and weezy? Easy! 
 Look at me now, look at me now 
 Oh, I'm getting paper 
 Look at me now 
 Oh, look at me now 
 Yeah, fresh than a muthaf-cker 
 (Lil Wayne) 
 Man f-ck these bitch ass n-ggas how y'all doin'? 
 I'm Lil Tunechi, I'm a nuisance, I go stupid, I go dumb like the 3 stooges 
 I don't eat sushi, I'm the shit, no I'm pollution, no substitution 
 Got a bitch that play in movies in my jacuzzi, p-ssy juicy 
 I never gave a f-ck about a hater got money on my radar 
 Dress like a skater, got a big house, came with a elevator 
 You n-ggas ain't eatin, f-ck it, tell a waiter 
 Marley said shoot em, and I said ok, 
 If you wanted bullshit then I'm like olay, 
 I don't care what you say, so don't even speak 
 Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil 
 That's word to my flag, and my flag red 
 I'm out of my head, bitch I'm outta my mind from the bottom I climb 
 You ain't hotter at mine, nope, not on my time and I'm not even trying 
 What's poppin' Slime? nothin' five, and if they trippin' f-ck 'em five 
 I ain't got no time to shuck and jive, these n-ggas as sweet as pumpkin pie 
 Ciroc and sprite on a private flight 
 Bitch I'm enticing, guiding light, and my pockets white and my diamonds white 
 And my mommas nice and my daddy's dead 
 You faggots scared 'cause I'm too wild, been here for a while 
 I was like f-ck trial I puts it down 
 I'm so young money if you got eyes look at me now bitch 
 Look at me now, look at me now 
 Oh, I'm getting paper 
 Look at me now 
 Oh, look at me now 
 Yeah, fresh than a muthaf-cker
