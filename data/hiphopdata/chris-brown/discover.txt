This time she's really out my life, oh 
 I know I gotta get her back 
 Just need one night to hit it right 
 But I can't get her alone, no 
 Know she deserves to up and leave 
 If it was me I'd do the same 
 I see that girl, know that she hopes 
 So I'll be damned to let it go, damned to let it go 
 I discover, discover I love her 
 Oh, I gotta get her back, oh 
 I discover, discover that I love her 
 Oh, that would get her back 
 I'm guessing this is where it ends (You don't even pick up for a nigga) 
 I know she's calling all her friends (And they don't like me, fuck y'all bitches) 
 They probably tryna take her out (All up in the VIP so they can take a picture) 
 And tryna find her ass a man, shit, make a nigga mad 
 'Cause she know I'm hurting, she know that I'm hurting 
 Yeah she know I care, she know that I care 
 I can't understand, know I treat you bad 
 But you don't get me back like that, no, no 
 Oh, oh, I gotta get my baby, girl don't leave me 
 All this crazy shit that you been dealing with it, you probably hate me, hey 
 Cause baby if you cheated, I couldn't handle that 
 To know that another nigga is making you smile like 
 I discover, discover I love her 
 Oh, I gotta get her back, whoa yeah 
 I discover, discover that I love her 
 Oh, that would get her back 
 I can't breathe, yeah 
 Can't breathe, can't breathe, yeah 
 Girl let me breathe again, breathe again 
 Let me breathe again, oh 
 I can't breath, can't sleep 
 Can't dream, so weak, girl 
 Gotta get you back, gotta get you back 
 Can't think, oh gee 
 I discover, discover I love her 
 Oh, I gotta get her back, oh 
 I discover, discover that I love her 
 Oh, that would get her back 
 Get you back oh, get you back oh 
 Can't think girl, oh gee oh, gee oh
