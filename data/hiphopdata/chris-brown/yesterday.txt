(Chorus- Chris Brown) 
 Yesterday I fell in love 
 Today feels like my funeral 
 I just got hit by a bus 
 Shouldn've been so beautiful 
 Don't know why I gave my heart, gave my trust, gave everything 
 You think that if I had the chance 
 To do it over again 
 I'd do something different 
 Make better decisions 
 Save me from my ignorance 
 But I keep 
 Making the same mistakes before I 
 I see the danger but I go forward 
 I'm sitting here trying to keep my composure 
 Knowing inside I'm broken and tore up 
 She got me gone I'm on her like a drug 
 I try to go but end up wanting more 
 Stuck in my head vivid as a picture 
 I Wanna be clean but I can't get rid of her 
 (Diddy) 
 Uh 
 Give my all you take it from me (from me girl) 
 And don't even replace it for me (no) 
 I wish you just fake it for me (fake it) 
 I wish I can make you love me more 
 You can't tell I f-cks wit you I needed you (need you) 
 I thought that you understood that based on how I treated you (treated you) 
 I don't pay attention to the rumors that you feed into 
 Know you're missing something I wish I was what completed you 
 Yesterday I fell in love 
 Today feels like my funeral 
 I just got hit by a bus 
 Shouldn've been so beautiful 
 Don't know why I gave my heart, gave my trust, gave everything 
 You think that if I had the chance 
 To do it over again 
 I'd do something different 
 Make better decisions 
 Save me from my ignorance 
 But I keep 
 Making the same mistakes before I 
 I see the danger but I go forward 
 I'm sitting here trying to keep my composure 
 Knowing inside I'm broken and tore up 
 She got me gone I'm on her like a drug 
 I try to go but end up wanting more 
 Stuck in my head vivid as a picture 
 I Wanna be clean but I can't get rid of her 
 I feel like a killer hit me (hit me) 
 The weapon was concealed initially (oh) 
 But I felt so much pain from it (pain) 
 You deserved to feel it with me more (more) 
 I feel like I beg wit you I plead wit you (plead wit you) 
 I don't comprehend how you can't love when it's so easy to (easy to oh) 
 I thought you could do it I believed in the naive in you (oh) 
 I just need to breathe baby now I got the freedom to (oh no) 
 (Chris Brown) 
 She's like a drug 
 And I don't think I can get rid of her 
 'Cause she got me in this curse 
 And it dawned on me I can't do nothing with her 
 This woman's worth 
 I Can't find my way out 
 And it hurts 
 I tried but she won't let me go 
 Oh, Oh, oh, oh, oh she won't let me go 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 She wont let me go (x2)
