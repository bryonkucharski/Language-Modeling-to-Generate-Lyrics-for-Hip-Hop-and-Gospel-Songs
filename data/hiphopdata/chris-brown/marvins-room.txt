(Verse 1: Chris Brown) 
 He's saying he's your best friend 
 And he's always the one in your ear 
 I know that he been waiting 
 To get my ass up out of here 
 It's been a couple months now 
 Baby I am not surprised 
 But I'm a real nigga 
 Girl, how you gon take his side 
 I bet if I lick that spot then you won't act like that 
 I miss giving you them backshots, girl you remember that 
 Baby and I'd be damned if I let him take my place 
 Don't listen to what that nigga say 
 'Cause he's just saying you could do better 
 And baby all I'm saying is he sound like a hater 
 And baby he could just fuck off and do us a favor 
 Mind your business, nigga stop being a hater 
 (Bridge: Seven) 
 Here we go, why these niggas keep hating for 
 Guess that's just the way it goes 
 Uh oh, that's the way it goes, Uh oh, Uh oh 
 Uh oh, that's the way it goes 
 (Verse 2: Chris Brown) 
 Baby what the hell are you thinking 
 By the way you screamin' at me thinkin' you've been drinking 
 I know that nigga's on your line 
 But he can't get what's mine, yeah 
 Baby you need to show me what the hell I did wrong 
 I need you to hold me, right here in your arms 
 I'm kissing your heart and all your little body parts 
 Baby, baby 
 (Verse 3: Kevin McCall) 
 K Mac 
 See it's a reason why she still with me 
 And she ain't with you 
 She see the real in me, and the bitch in you 
 Yeah, she friends with you, but she sexing me 
 When she be textin you, she be next to me 
 Showin me how weak you is, it's embarrassing 
 I'm a real nigga so I guess you are a mannequin 
 Bad on the phone but in person you be panicking 
 I ain't even stressed, got a bag full of cannabis 
 I ain't with the bull so this ain't beef 
 You a weenie I bet you be lying on your meat 
 If real recognize real, who the fuck is you 
 She need a principal, not a substitute 
 (Outro: Kevin McCall and Chris Brown) 
 He's just saying you could do better (no, he can't) 
 Girl stop playing he could never 
 Be the one you need 'cause you're the one for me girl 
 I know how to please you right 
 He's just saying you could do better 
 Girl stop playing you know he could never 
 Be the one you need 'cause you're the one for me, yeah 
 But I'm a real nigga
