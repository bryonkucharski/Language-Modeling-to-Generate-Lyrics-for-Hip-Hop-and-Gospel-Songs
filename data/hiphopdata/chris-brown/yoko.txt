Bust a couple bands 
 Blow a 100 fast 
 I just made a hundred off of 50 pay 
 Where them bad Asian bitches holdin' down my city at? 
 Where them girls from the A with that pretty face? 
 Round thing, yeah I'm on that loud thang 
 Pop another bottle, shooting corks at the crowd: dang! 
 Yeah, I'm a stunna, nah, I ain't Baby tho 
 Young dude with the lazy flow 
 Watch all these ladies go 
 Crazy when I pull up right beside em 
 I do a buck 30, I'm just into flying 
 I smell like dirty money, plus this cookie that I'm lighting 
 Bucket's full of ice and bottles on fire inside em 
 Call 'em Yoko Ono 
 Only ride solo 
 Mission for the dolo 
 One look in her eyes, she'll eat you alive 
 She's a man eater, ski mask diva 
 She might up 'n' leave you, but you can never leave her 
 You ain't never had someone, you can never keep her 
 Tricking on the next man, he can't have her either... 
 I Call her Yoko Ono 
 Look, got a boatload of them Asian hoes 
 On vacation steady bakin' with Jamaican hoes 
 I got cash boy, I don't care what you makin' ho 
 50 thousand on my wrist: I'm feedin' Eskimos 
 Damn! Put VA on this shit 
 Buy 100 fuckin' bottles, let 'em spray in this bitch 
 My money flow real long, I do relays in this bitch 
 And you know I kill songs, it's Burner, CB and Wiz 
 All righty now, ha, look at me, rose, I'm on nigga 
 15 grand on a what, That's just my phone, nigga 
 Northern California, where blunts look like cones, nigga 
 Two up, two down, make that switch, yeah 
 Call 'em Yoko Ono 
 Only ride solo 
 Mission for the dolo 
 One look in her eyes, she'll eat you alive 
 She's a man eater, ski mask diva 
 She might leave you, but you can never leave her 
 You ain't never had someone, you can never keep her 
 Tricking on the next man, he can't have her either... 
 Call her Yoko Ono 
 Shades on, Polo white T 
 Me leaving here alone? That's unlikely 
 Not a stoner bitch, but she like me 
 Tryna get that final cut like Spike Lee 
 I jack them hoes, direct them hoes 
 Take 'em home and let them hoes go live out their fantasies 
 They're popping pills, I'm rolling weed 
 Even got a couple bad bitches overseas 
 Out the back, as ain't no tags when I'm shopping 
 And my bad filled with options so don't ask what it cost 
 I'm in a Maserati coupe going so fast that I lost 'em 
 And my bitch got so much swag that these bad bitches on us 
 Ah! Killing y'all, pow! (dag) get a a coffin
