spoken: 
 Check this out girl 
 I know you sitting back saying to yourself 
 "I know he ain't trying to holla!" 
 Naw 
 (Laughs) 
 But there's something I got to tell you 
 Oh yeah, Oh yeah 
 You ain't got to do it though 
 And I just want you to sit back and listen 
 While I sing this song to you 
 Check me 
 Listen 
 It's not the hardest thing for me to say 
 Without cracking a smile 
 It's something that we both really feel inside 
 But never talked about 
 They call in love 
 Oh yes they do 
 A dangerous thing, when you're part of the game 
 So girl I feel you when you get emotional 
 And don't want to let me go 
 But there's something I got to tell you 
 I don't mean to cut you off but the question is: 
 So when you gone be my girl? (When you gone be my girl?) 
 I want to know 
 When it comes to loving, (why) you change the subject (you should know) 
 And girl you know that I'm the man (you want) 
 Oh yes I am 
 Girl what's really good with you? 
 (So when you gone be my girl?) When you gone be my girl 
 All this breaking up, is getting old now 
 So baby tell me where I stand 
 I know 
 You probably saying to yourself this brotha tripping but 
 This stuff is real 
 But ain't true men that felt love will have the nerve to step up 
 And tell that baby what's up 
 To let her know he's really impressed 
 Now getting straight to the bottom line 
 You're the type of kind of girl a gangsta needs by his side 
 So when you get emotional 
 I won't let you go 
 There's something I got to tell you 
 I don't mean to cut you off but the question is: 
 So when you gone be my girl? (When you gone be my girl?) 
 I want to know 
 When it comes to loving, (why) you change the subject (you should know) 
 And girl you know that I'm the man (you want) 
 Oh yes I am 
 Girl what's really good with you? 
 (So when you gone be my girl?) 
 All this playing up, is getting old now 
 So baby tell me where I stand 
 Tell me girl 
 (I don't mean to be rude but I got to know) 
 So when you gone be my girl? (When you gone be my girl?) 
 I want to know 
 When it comes to loving, (why) you change the subject 
 And girl you know that I'm he man you want (I am the man you need) 
 So baby what's really good with you? 
 So when you gone be my girl? 
 All this breaking up, is getting old now 
 Baby tell me where I stand
