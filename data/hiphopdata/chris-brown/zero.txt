I thought we were great 
 You took your love back and ran us off track 
 I counted all the days, 
 'Til you would come back, how stupid was that? 
 Now you're missing what we used to have 
 Guess the vodka brought the feeling back 
 I was caught up in the aftermath 
 But now, if you really want to know 
 Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero 
 Gave a hundred percent but all I got from you, zero, zero 
 I thought you were the one, then you turned around 
 Found somebody better, like I never met ya 
 Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero 
 (Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero) 
 That's how many fucks I give 
 Wake up with a dime 
 Get up to no good better than you could 
 Go out, free our minds 
 Like you never would, never understood 
 Now you're missing what we used to have 
 You been creeping round my Instagram 
 I was caught up in the aftermath 
 But now, if you really wanna know 
 Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero 
 Gave a hundred percent but all I got from you, zero, zero 
 I thought you were the one, then you turned around 
 Found somebody better, like I never met ya 
 Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero 
 (Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero) 
 That's how many fucks I give 
 Broke back then but a nigga rich now 
 Got dollars, got euros, got yen, I got pounds 
 Zeros, zeros 
 Calling me up cause your bank check bounced 
 My new chick one hundred 
 And she got her own dinero, zero 
 You think I'm thinking about your ass? 
 Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero 
 Gave a hundred percent but all I got from you, zero, zero 
 I thought you were the one, then you turned around 
 Found somebody better, like I never met ya 
 Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero 
 (Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero) 
 That's how many fucks I give, 
 (Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero) 
 That's how many fucks I give
