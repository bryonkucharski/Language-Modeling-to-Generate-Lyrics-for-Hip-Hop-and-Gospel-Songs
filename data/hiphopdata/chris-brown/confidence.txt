Yeah, oh 
 Yeah 
 Tell me what you feeling 
 Wanna know what's on your mind 
 I know we ain't committed 
 But we do this all the time, oh 
 Please don't tell nobody 'bout this affair 
 Baby, go and dirty whine it out, thank you, baby 
 We might not make it to the room, from right here 
 I love it when you tell me what to do, like sit right there 
 Yeah, I need that, Fifty Shades, ooh 
 Tie your hands properly, I'm loving it 
 It's your confidence, oh woah 
 Your confidence, oh woah

 And girl, I wish you made your decision 
 Girl, go ahead and make up your mind 
 Got me all out here feinin' 
 Please don't tell nobody 'bout this affair 
 Baby, go and dirty whine it out, thank you, baby 
 We might not make it to the room, from right here 
 I love it when you tell me what to do, like sit right there 
 It's your confidence, oh woah 
 Your confidence, confidence, confidence
