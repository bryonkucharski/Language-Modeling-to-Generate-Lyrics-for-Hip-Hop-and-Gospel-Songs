Africa is my descent 
 And here I am far from home 
 I dwell within a land that is meant 
 For many men not my tone, yeah 
 The blood of God is my defense 
 Let it drop down to my seed 
 Showers to your innocence 
 To protect you for all eternity 
 And with this wood I beat this drum 
 And we won't see defeat 
 From kings to queens 
 Becomes a prince 
 Knowledge and wisdom 
 Is understanding what we need 
 (And this day will come) 
 Ever since the day you came 
 My whole world began to change 
 I knew then to dedicate my life 
 For your own 
 (And this day will come) 
 Everyday I see you grow 
 And remember what you already know 
 I receive, I receive the love 
 That radiates from your glow 
 From which you came was love 
 And that's how it all should be 
 You and my soul are I 
 Through all the time and history, yeah 
 (And past) 
 Thank you, thank you
