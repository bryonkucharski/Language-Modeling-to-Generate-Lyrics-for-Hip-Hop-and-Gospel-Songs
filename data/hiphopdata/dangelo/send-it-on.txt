 Send it up 
 Send it through 
 Send it right back 2 U 
 Your inner view to me is 
 Something that I do desire 
 Struggling 2 see a new something that I fantasize 
 So I'm sending 
 U can't disguise your emotions 
 U know that I see in your eyes 
 U soul's, your soul's somethin' that I feel inside 
 Run, run, run, run if I run Lord only knows how far that I 
 And I will fall behind 
 Gotta find a better place, gotta find a better space 
 So that I, so my life may be the reason why 
 Hold on be strong, 4 your own 
 Move on b4 long, you'll get home 
 If your feeling insecure 
 U can be sure, Even if it take forever and a day for me 2 do 
 I gotta send it on 2 U 
 Tell me what will I do 
 Send it right back 2 U
