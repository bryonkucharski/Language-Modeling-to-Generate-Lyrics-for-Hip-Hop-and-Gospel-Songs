One, two, three, four... 
 She done worked a root. 
 Done worked a root that will not be reversed 
 Then I go on, go on my role in her play with no rehearsal 
 Said, I left my mojo 
 Left my mojo in my favorite suit...(yes I did, yeah) 
 She left a stain, left a dirty stain in my heart, I can't refute. 
 She done worked a root! 
 In the name of love and war took my shield and sword 
 From the pit of the bottom, that knows no floor 
 Like the rain to the dirt, from the vine to the wine. 
 From the Alpha to creation, to the end of all time. 
 Said I went, Said I went, Said I went to the doctor. 
 The man told me there ain't nothin' wrong with me 
 But I beg to differ, I been feelin' this pain for much too long 
 I feel like my soul is empty 
 My blood is cold and I can't feel my legs 
 I need someone to hold me. 
 Bring me back to life b4 I'm dead. 
 She done worked a root... root... rooooot. 
 Adlibs 
 I feel my soul is empty 
 My blood is cold and I can't feel my legs, 
 I need someone to hold me 
 Bring me back to life before' I'm dead... 
 She done worked a Root.
