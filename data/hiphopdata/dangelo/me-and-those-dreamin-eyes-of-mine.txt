When I first saw you baby, I wanted to die 
 Me and those dreaming eyes of mine, started to cry 
 Then I'd dream, wishing my fantasy 
 Would soon become a reality 
 'Cause every time I see you baby, all I do is sigh 
 'Cause you're the most precious thing 
 That my dreaming eyes has ever seen 
 So I'll continue to dream 
 Me and those dreaming eyes of mine 
 Is it just that you're the finest little thing 
 That I ever saw, or is my imagination running too far 
 Or is it that my eyes are telling me something you could never see 
 Something like me being with you, or you being with me 
 Ooh we baby, you've redefined my vision of love it seems 
 Your love be the cherry in my chocolate covered dreams 
 So it seems, my oh my 
 Me and those dreaming eyes of mine 
 Oh my goodness, here she comes, switching that ass 
 I wondered if the men in her past have treated he bad 
 But if I had the chance, I'd treat her like a queen 
 Just like I do in all my dreams 
 If you only knew how many times that I think of you 
 I'm quite sure that you would find, I'm going out of my mind 
 My oh my, me and those dreaming eyes of mine 
 Is it just that you're the finest little thing 
 That I ever saw, or is my imagination running too far 
 Or is it that my eyes are telling me something you could never see 
 Something like me being with you, or you being with me 
 Ooh we baby, you've redefined my vision of love it seems 
 Your love be the cherry in my chocolate covered dreams 
 So it seems, my oh my 
 Me and those dreaming eyes of mine 
 Is it just that you're the finest little thing 
 That I ever saw, or is my imagination running too far 
 Or is it that my eyes are telling me something you could never see 
 Something like me being with you, or you being with me 
 Ooh we baby, you've redefined my vision of love it seems 
 Your love be the cherry in my chocolate covered dreams 
 So it seems, my oh my 
 Me and those dreaming eyes of mine 
 Oh, my eyes 
 My eyes
