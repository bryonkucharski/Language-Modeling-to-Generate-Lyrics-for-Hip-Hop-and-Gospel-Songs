1st verse 
 How do you retain your cool, 
 Seems you love breaks all the rules, 
 You may think that I'm a pro, 
 But I can never seem to keep my control. 
 How can you stand to take things so slow. 
 Look at you, You're so smooth, 
 When I'm around you, I can't keep my cool 
 Repeat 1 time 
 2nd verse 
 I'm so used to getting what I want 
 When I want it, and where I want it. 
 But in your field I"m inexperienced, 
 So inexperienced, Baby I'm delirious 
 Look at you, You're so smooth. 
 When I'm around you, I can't keep my cool 
 Repeat 2 times 
 I can't keep my cool 
 When you're around, I won't be the fool 
 You may that I don't know 
 But all the things I want are in my control
