Uuuuuh, Yeah Uuuuuh 
 You want my love and you can't deny 
 You know it's good, but you try to hide 
 You turn down love like it's really bad 
 You can't give what you never had 
 Well bless your soul, you can fool a few (hey ai) 
 But, I know the truth and so do you 
 You can't hide love, 
 But I betcha (uuuh) betcha (betcha) 
 You can't hide longer 
 Well I betcha (well I betcha) 
 You can't hide feeling inside 
 You can't pretend there's nothing there 
 Girl, I look in your eyes, I see you care 
 So why not stop trying to run and hide 
 You won't find out, if you never try 
 You can't hide love, 
 But I betcha (uuh) betcha (betcha) 
 You want my love well I betcha (well I betcha) 
 You can't hide feeling inside 
 Can you found the time for kissin' 
 Can you find the time to listen 
 Life found the time to bug you 
 Can you find the time for blessing (heey aaaiii) 
 Ah ahhhha aaahaaaaaah
