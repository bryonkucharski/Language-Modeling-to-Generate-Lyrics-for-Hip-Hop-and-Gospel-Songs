Said I gota jonz in my bonz 
 I said this feeling that I got 
 Won't leave me 'lone 
 Said I got a jonz in bonz 
 I said this feelin' I got 
 Goes long and strong 
 All my natural life I've been waiting 
 I've been holding on 
 To everything that belongs to me 
 Fooled, misied by every single possibility 
 What I wouldn't give to be 
 Next to the things that where meant fo me 
 Uh ooh 
 On and on, on and on, on and on, on, on, 
 Baby, shoo do doo da do 
 Ad lib out
