 Today I played it safe, cards are in my favor 
 Can't you leave 2 much 2 chance, 
 Woke up with time to waver 
 Yesterday was crazy, 
 Mysteries I know now, now I know, 
 The ins and outs of things from day 2 day 
 That's how it goes 
 Don't get confused about it, 
 Just try to do your thang 
 Cause in the end gotta know just how to play the game 
 I search for answers often, 
 I paid the price for many 
 Still long for happiness 
 Not promised to the plenty 
 I've gotta go on 
 Good days, bad days, halfway days 
 Good times, bad times, halfway times 
 Good days, bad days, halfway days 
 But I'm still looking for a greatdayndamornin' 
 Today might be the day, I get it in the pocket 
 Lord knows if there's an angle, gotta try 2 find it 
 Gotta get over, before the sun comes up 
 Just in case of an emergency, gotta tighten up
