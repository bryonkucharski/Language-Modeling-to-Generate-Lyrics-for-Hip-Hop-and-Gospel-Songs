Stay chuggin' on the 40 ounce, brain cells fried 
 Like a clam strip, all day get high 
 Neverending Story, Falcor stay fly 
 Mom's a math teacher, so I gotta multiply 
 Not a mathematician myself so I ride, In my 98 Altima parked outside 
 Hustlin' mixtapes, I'm tryna get by, double U E double B follow with a Y 
 Motha fucka that's me and I be so cool 
 To be on my level your gonna need a step stool 
 Always been a troublemaker gotta break rules 
 Breakin' every law until they kick me out of school 
 So amped up, you think I'm chuggin jet fuel 
 Chasin' a bottle of moon shine with an O'Doules 
 Since O'Doule rules, let me pull a Billy Madison 
 And have 'em slippin' on banana peels if they challenge him 
 I"m bafflin' any competitor with what I'm rappin' and 
 The futures lookin' bright I think I'm starin' at a halogen 
 Born in '88, I got it tatted on my abdomen 
 Product of the 90s, everyday practicin' 
 Then it started happenin', turned into a beast 
 Full bred pit with a little Maltese 
 Woof, slaughter any track I see 
 You've now been warned, you'd better hide your beats 
 I'mma never give a fuck about you 
 I'm just doing what I do 
 Murder any beat I put my mind too 
 Thought you knew that's what I do 
 Rappin' on the mike till my face turns blue 
 Through and through that's what I do 
 That's what I do 
 Stop sleepin' over there, man pass the blunt 
 L ride around town and be back for lunch 
 Got a full plate of beats and some Captain Crunch 
 Mean on the mic, only lost a battle once 
 Everybody else, murked em, cooked it up, served em 
 Pen in hand, I got the dexterity of a surgeon 
 Freestyles burn em, written rhymes flawless 
 Like the names of every Mutant Ninja Turtle, I'm an artist 
 Bitch, nobody stoppin' what I'm sayin' 
 Lyrical display gone shock 'em like Raiden 
 Everyday ragin', show me where the party's at 
 Where the bitches where the broads where the hotties at? 
 Where the liquor where the bud, where the Molly at? 
 Where the stage? I'm bouta give the crowd a heart attack 
 Life's short so you know I gotta live it up 
 Brim low, dutch rolled, I'ma never give a fuck 
 I'mma never give a fuck about you 
 I'm just doing what I do 
 Murder any beat I put my mind too 
 Thought you knew that's what I do 
 Rappin' on the mike till my face turns blue 
 Through and through that's what I do 
 That's what I do 
 All I got's my word and my balls just a nerd with a cause 
 Livin' life like a video game, so press pause 
 Double tap X with a shot to the brain 
 Backback square, catch em' with the scorpion chain 
 So get over here bitch, I'll kick em' like Liu Kang 
 And fatality anybody who shits on my name 
 It's that tatted up tyrant, heatin' up the climate 
 Pissin' on these haters like puppies on fire hydrants 
 It's that motherfuckin' Optimus Rhyme 
 Full bottle of pills, blunted with a bottle of wine 
 Fully transform bout to take over the game soon 
 Ain't no mothafucka I'm afraid to bring the flame to 
 Got 'em rotisserie while I be smokin' piffery 
 Makin' words connect like letters written in calligraphy 
 Not a person here steppin' in my shoes 
 Cause see Webbys back, and this is what I do 
 I'mma never give a fuck about you 
 I'm just doing what I do 
 Murder any beat I put my mind too 
 Thought you knew that's what I do 
 Rappin' on the mike till my face turns blue 
 Through and through that's what I do 
 That's what I do
