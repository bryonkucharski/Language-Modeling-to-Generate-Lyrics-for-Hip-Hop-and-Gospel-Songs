I've been stuck underground, but now it's my time 
 Time to take flight, right in to the skyline 
 Off to beautiful women sippin' on fine wine 
 Up at the stadium where the lights lime 
 And I'm, movin' way past sound check 
 Still lookin' for a life that I ain't found yet 
 Round trip on a magical school bus 
 Before we touch down, shit they already knew us 
 Made it from the bottom to professionally rappin' 
 While they were tellin' me that it was never gonna happen 
 Now it's funny to see the haters' reactions 
 'Cause they ain't sayin' a word, Charlie Chaplin 
 I'm back in this bitch relaxin' 
 Put in the groundwork now it's time to cash in 
 Heh, and everybody knows I earned that 
 Headed to the skyline, feet up, first class 
 Yeah! 
 I don't know about you but I know one thing 
 I ain't gonna wait around here to make it 
 Anybody with a dream got to feel the same 
 If it ain't given to me then I'ma take it 
 So let me just 
 Fly fly, fly fly 
 'Cause they tellin' me it's my time 
 Fly fly, fly fly 
 And disappear into the skyline 
 Spit the toughest shit, who touchin' this? 
 Always chillin' with a bird, Snuffaluffagus 
 And I'm lovin' it, no Mickey D's 
 Just Colt 45 and some piffy trees 
 Jeeze, got my boardin' pass ready 
 I'm headin' to the top, they ain't gettin' past Webby 
 Yeah, been on the grind since 8th grade 
 Went from gettin' no girls to bangin' Playmates 
 Heh, what up Ms. November? 
 My flight's taking off, got my shit together 
 Ready for whatever, do it better than before 
 I'm the reason my competitors are headin' for the door 
 'Cause I'm deadly and I'm raw with the mic tonight 
 Got the cameras all flashin' like a lightning' strike 
 Heh, I'm on another altitude 
 And they ain't ready for the shit that I'm about to do 
 I don't know about you but I know one thing 
 I ain't gonna wait around here to make it 
 Anybody with a dream got to feel the same 
 If it ain't given to me then I'ma take it 
 So let me just 
 Fly fly, fly fly 
 'Cause they tellin' me it's my time 
 Fly fly, fly fly 
 And disappear into the skyline 
 If you got a dream you should follow it 
 Cause not everybody's capable of keepin' straight A's for a scholarship 
 As a kid no one could figure me out 
 So I would like to thank Hofstra for kickin' me out 
 And look at me now, I'm doin' pretty well for my age 
 Considerin' two years ago I was makin' minimum wage 
 Heh, and now we doin' okay, Skyline-flow, up, up and away 
 Heh, and I ain't lookin' for a handout 
 Shit I got the fans now, mothafuckers stand down 
 Live my life to a whole new beat 
 Finally standin' on my own two feet 
 Cause it got that tough, been kicked while I was down 
 But I never gave in, and I got back up 
 Yup, gettin' close, well I better be 
 But all I see is the skyline ahead of me 
 I don't know about you but I know one thing 
 I ain't gonna wait around here to make it 
 Anybody with a dream got to feel the same 
 If it ain't given to me then I'ma take it 
 So let me just 
 Fly fly, fly fly 
 'Cause they tellin' me it's my time 
 Fly fly, fly fly 
 And disappear into the skyline
