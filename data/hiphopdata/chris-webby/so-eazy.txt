I came to pass the blunt around (blunt around) 
 I fuck around (fuck around) 
 Pour up a full cup and chug it down 
 Homie that was yesterday (yesterday), so they wonder how (wonder how) 
 I can do this every single time I come around 
 But it's so eazy when you're W-E-B-B-Y 
 Eazy when you're W-E-B-B-Y 
 Eazy when you're W-E-B-B-Y 
 Eazy when you're W-E-B-B-Y 
 Yeah I'm puffing loud, got me buzzing now 
 I'm just trying to do some shit that makes my mother proud 
 Live from the underground, met with all the labels 
 And they said I could make a million dollars if I dumbed it down 
 But I said "fuck that!" I'ma do it Web's way 
 'Cause I'm fucking dope, well at least that's what my friends say 
 Lyrically a sensei, muy caliente, comprende? 
 Thursday to Wednesday I be so crazy 
 It's not what I try for but it's my business 
 Homie you should mind yours 
 I couldn't lose my mind more 
 Jumping out the window on the 9th floor 
 Now they're saying they gotta send me to the psych ward 
 Straightjacketed, a battle it ain't happenin' 
 That be like seeing Drake and Rampage in a cage match 
 And I've been put up on this planet to ramble and raise havoc 
 With a bottle and an eighth a day habit 
 Y-O-U-N-G veteran, every time I'm stepping in 
 Cold as the toes of a penguin 
 Bad to my skeleton, bad to the bone as I've ever been 
 Feet up on the throne that I've settled in 
 Running off of adrenaline and unprescribed medicine 
 Lighting up an L again and hit it till my head'll spin 
 Started with a crumpled up Lincoln and now it's Benjamins 
 Used to be a loser but now the world is watching Webby win 
 It's so easy, veni, vidi, vici 
 Young Houdini, rabbit in my three piece 
 Used to be on YouTube, now I'm up on TV 
 Everybody spell it out, it's W-E-B 
 Add another B-Y, you're about to see why 
 I'm a giant, start my sentences with "fee-fi" 
 Fo fum, go dumb, putting work in 
 So it's time you met the man behind the curtain 
 Killin' this game since it ain't love us 
 I do it so easy, it ain't nothing, I tell 'em it ain't nothing 
 I see you dropped your new shit but it ain't buzzin' 
 I'm killing this game since it ain't love us 
 I do it so easy, it ain't nothing 
 I tell 'em it ain't nothing, I tell 'em it ain't nothing
