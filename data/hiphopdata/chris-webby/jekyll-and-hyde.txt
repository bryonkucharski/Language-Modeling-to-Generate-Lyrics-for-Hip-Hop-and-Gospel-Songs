Which ever way the wind blows 
 I'ma keep my brim low 
 With these glasses that can shelter my eyes 
 Feeling like a Sckitzo 
 From the life I live yo 
 Now I'm caught between both Jekyll and Hyde 
 Jekyll and Hyde 
 Which ever way the wind blows 
 They gon' ask me why I change and where did Chris go 
 A stoned soul away from fame, rocked up in this glass house 
 With the fucking world watching every movement through the windows 
 It's a cold world and it predicts snow 
 Got me stressed out, sitting with spliff rolled 
 Thinking back to when I started as a kid yo 
 Blind to the biz, all I knew was how to spit flows 
 Young teen so damn naive, learning jedi mind tricks with immortal technique 
 Eminem's LP with some F.A.D X to the Z Snoopy D.O double G, D.R.E 
 Skipping church, staying home to alone to scribble down a written verse 
 Dreaming that one day making music be what I did for work 
 I follow through with that, but always seem to hit reverse 
 Like maybe I'm scared of being famous 'cause it's a gifted curse 
 No time to be an introvert, 'cause now I gotta be in front 
 Of the camera every fucking where that it follows me 
 Ain't no alone time, just studio time 
 Haven't seen my family in weeks, there ain't no time 
 When the tours booked, then its road time 
 Sound check, hotel, then it's show time 
 Mr.Hyde I thought you checked in playing second fiddle 
 Now I'm stuck in the middle 
 Which ever way the wind blows 
 I'ma keep my brim low 
 With these glasses that can shelter my eyes 
 Feeling like a Sckitzo 
 From the life I live yo 
 Now I'm caught between both Jekyll and Hyde 
 Jekyll and Hyde 
 Jekyll and Hyde 
 Forced to be two people, got me losing my mind 
 Jekyll and Hyde 
 Jekyll and Hyde 
 Just tryna' find my way and taking you for the ride 
 Jekyll and Hyde 
 I'm stuck as two people, there's the man behind the mic and the person that I am off stage in real life 
 The person with the stress that eats away at him at night, drives him crazy, every step along the way has been a fight 
 With any love, I'm always getting hate, and how would you like having strangers talking shit about you every day 
 But I brush it off, wont go get it straight, but that negative energy still affects my day. 
 I'm just trying to make a hard earned living dude, 'cause of what I do, these people see me from a different view 
 Sick of all these stupid questions in my interviews, like the mother fucking color of my skin is news 
 Sick of people thinking that I'm on some gimmick shit, sick of all the comparisons that they hit me with 
 Like every other white kid spit no different right? fuck that, my brain waves are limitless 
 I'm just a kid tryna' sing his song and by chance other people started singing along 
 I feel like an old soul in a young man's game, but I'm living hip hop and the love ain't changed 
 Put my life in it when I wrote them tracks, but every piece of me I give you, I don't get back 
 Now I'm feeling like an unfinished puzzle, bartender gonna pour me a double. Yeah 
 Ever way the wind blows 
 I'ma keep my brim low 
 With these glasses that can shelter my eyes 
 Feeling like a Sckitzo 
 From the life I live yo 
 Now I'm caught between both Jekyll and Hyde 
 Jekyll and Hyde 
 Jekyll and Hyde 
 Forced to be two people, got me losing my mind 
 Jekyll and Hyde 
 Jekyll and Hyde 
 Just tryna' find my way and taking you for the ride 
 Jekyll and Hyde
