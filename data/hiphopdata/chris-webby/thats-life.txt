See life's a crazy thing man 
 Sometimes you're up, sometimes you're down 
 At least we alive 
 They tellin' me, tellin' me, tellin' me, "Life is amazin'" 
 Then why am I runnin' from all of my problems in bottles of Jameson? 
 I'm stuck in this cycle of self-medication 
 Not only me, it's probably you 
 We all got our vices, gettin' us through 
 For all the shit life will leave at our shoes 
 On the door step like the daily news 
 But what can we do? Just buckle the fuck up, and get to enjoyin' the ride 
 At least we alive, even when everything seems like it sucks, just keep that in mind 
 I know, know, know, that ain't no one keepin' me down 
 Just tryin' to stay with them positive vibes until I'm six feet in the ground 
 I don't even need me a casket, just take all my cremated ashes 
 Throw 'em up high, and let the wind take 'em wherever it pleases whenever it passes 
 But until that day I'ma keep my head high, live life my way 
 Through all the frustration, all of the pain, all that you really could say is, "That's life" 
 They tellin' me, tellin' me, tellin' me, "Look on the bright side" 
 But that silver linin' ain't easy to see when I'm sittin' and watchin' the time fly 
 So if you feelin' likewise, just follow me, follow me, follow me down 
 Shit I don't know where the fuck that I'm goin' but nobody's stoppin' me now 
 Whether or not I'm the popular sound 
 The radio station on public opinions 
 Nothin' to me, I'm not stuck in my feelings 
 Fuck how they feelin', I grinded for years and got peanuts compared to these others with millions 
 But uh, I'm not complainin' man 
 The thing about problems, dude, we get caught up in 
 Forget that everyone else has got 'em too 
 These dark circles, sittin' under my eyes 
 I spark purple, 'cause I'm stuck in this bind 
 I'm star searchin', but there's nothin' to find 
 So when they ask me if it's worth it, I just tell 'em, "That's life" 
 That's life man 
 Fuck it, at least we livin', right?
