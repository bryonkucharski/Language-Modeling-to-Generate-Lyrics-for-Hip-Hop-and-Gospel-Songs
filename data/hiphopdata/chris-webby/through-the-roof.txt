Yeah 
 We goin' through the mother fuckin' roof 
 You know what I mean? 
 I'm through the roof 
 I'm through the roof 
 So through the roof that I can't get no higher than I am 
 So through the roof that I can't get no higher than I am 
 So through the roof that I can't get no higher than I am 
 So through the roof that I can't get no higher than I am 
 I'm through the roof like St. Nicholas 
 But I don't got no Christmas gifts I'm only here to spit this shit 
 Beam me up Scotty, My feet are liftin' quick 
 Speed over infinite, leavin' the solar system bitch 
 I'm out in the mysterious beyond 
 With a fat booty blonde and a jaar of marijuana 
 Sauna, flow so hot, so hot my whole life is like a slow-mo shot 
 Passin' mars craters, and waivin' to Darth Vader 
 The sky is not the limit, bitch I'm building starscrapers 
 Got the cigar paper, put the weed in it 
 Hittin' warp drive, and passin' the speed limits 
 Reppin' 203 they know these digits 
 Tatted on my ribs so CT with it 
 Skinny as a motherfucker still I rep the Huskies 
 I'm through the roof now bitch no one's above me 
 I'm through the roof 
 I'm through the roof 
 So through the roof that I can't get no higher than I am 
 So through the roof that I can't get no higher than I am 
 So through the roof that I can't get no higher than I am 
 So through the roof that I can't get no higher than I am 
 I've been through the roof, Now I'm through the Stratosphere 
 Millennium falcon, hyper drive and I'm outta here 
 Got my light saber in hand 
 Been on the grind since before diddy decided he was making a band 
 Now I'm here shakin' hands with fans, and it's about time 
 Defying gravity smokin' bogies on cloud nine, high 
 That's how I've always gotta be 
 Fuckin' human oddity, always burning it down properly 
 So bring the pot to me, and Webby's gonna roll it up 
 Piss tag shit, take a week for me to sober up 
 Ain't no need for spellin' it out 
 I'm through the roof like a fuckin' tree fell in your house, bitch 
 I'm through the roof 
 I'm through the roof 
 So through the roof that I can't get no higher than I am 
 So through the roof that I can't get no higher than I am 
 So through the roof that I can't get no higher than I am 
 So through the roof that I can't get no higher than I am 
 That I can't get no higher than I am 
 That I can't get no higher than I am 
 That I can't get no higher than I am 
 That I can't get no higher than I am 
 I can't get no higher than I am 
 Captain Fire up, always got a lighter in my hand 
 Carry so much tree that my pockets turn green 
 On some Tom Hanks shit, Apollo 13 
 Cleaner than the cut on school picture day 
 They tryna to step to C-Webb, cool pick a day 
 I'll be there to show you up, keep my jaw loaded up 
 Roll it up, blow a dutch 
 Spit it hella dope, putty always smell of smoke 
 They can't even see me with a telescope 
 Think your umbrella broke, I make it rain bitch 
 Ask El Roca he'll tell you the same shit 
 It's that crazy motherfucker from YouTube 
 Tryna see how many cells in my brain I could lose dude 
 My minds out to sea, on a booze cruise 
 I'm through the floor boards, I'm through the roof too 
 I'm through the roof 
 I'm through the roof 
 So through the roof that I can't get no higher than I am 
 So through the roof that I can't get no higher than I am 
 So through the roof that I can't get no higher than I am 
 So through the roof that I can't get no higher than I am 
 That I can't get no higher than I am 
 That I can't get no higher than I am 
 That I can't get no higher than I am 
 That I can't get no higher than I am
