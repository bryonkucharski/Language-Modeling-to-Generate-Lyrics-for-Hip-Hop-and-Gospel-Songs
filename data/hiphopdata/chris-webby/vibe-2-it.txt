Just vibe to it, watch how I do it 
 Rolling windows down, and then ride to it 
 Dealing with the seat back, and recline to it 
 Just turn the volume high, and then vibe to it 
 Now vibe to it, watch how I do it 
 Turn it up, and party the whole night to it 
 Throw some weed in the bong, and get high to it 
 Just turn the volume high and then vibe to it 
 I keeps a bunch of different colored hoes, yo I miss match 
 Homies outside of my clique that carry click-clack 
 Got 'em sayin' I'm the truth 'cause I spit facts 
 So these niggas really can't see me like it's pitch black 
 Nigga, this that, oh you runnin' shit? I missed that 
 The tables turned, now you wonder where your bitch at 
 They like, "Sap, we know you do it, don't overdo it" 
 'Cause I'm bringin' way too much liquor to the kick back 
 Hoes love me like Denzel with no five 
 I trust no ho, doin' well with no job 
 That weak shit you makin' requires a slow nod 
 You beggin' for spares, niggas get played with no prob 
 Just because they know I'm, dope with no cosign 
 Screamin', "Sap it's yo time, turn this into show time" 
 But step back and let me do just that 
 I'm getting' off like I do just rap, so turn it up and just 
 Vibe to it, watch how I do it 
 Rolling windows down, and then ride to it 
 Dealing with the seat back, and recline to it 
 Just turn the volume high, and then vibe to it 
 Now vibe to it, watch how I do it 
 Turn it up, and party the whole night to it 
 Throw some weed in the bong, and get high to it 
 Just turn the volume high and then vibe to it 
 See the white boy back up in this bitch, and now I'm 2.0 
 And ain't nobody makin' all the fuckin' noise that I be 
 Drive real slow with them seats down low 
 Rims shinin' like the leaves on poison ivy 
 Smoke is all up in my vehicle so, you know I be gettin' bent like origami 
 But this life of mine is like Life of Pi 
 Yeah, I gotta hang tough when the water choppy 
 Vibe to it, I'm the vibrator, 'bout to blow so big I'ma leave behind craters 
 Tell 'em, "Hi hater" 
 If you like it or not, my song's stuck in your head like I wrote 'em on fly paper 
 Ain't no time taken stressed out 
 We turnin' up until your head bounce 
 And burn another from my fresh ounce 
 Vibe right and I'm takin' it slow, doin' me the only way that I know 
 So everybody go and 
 Vibe to it, watch how I do it 
 Rolling windows down, and then ride to it 
 Dealing with the seat back, and recline to it 
 Just turn the volume high, and then vibe to it 
 Now vibe to it, watch how I do it 
 Turn it up, and party the whole night to it 
 Throw some weed in the bong, and get high to it 
 Just turn the volume high and then vibe to it 
 Vibe to it 
 Vibe to it 
 Vibe to it 
 Vibe to it 
 Vibe to it
