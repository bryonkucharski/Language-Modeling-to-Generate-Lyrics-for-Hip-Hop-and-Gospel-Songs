Yeah, all you motherfuckers 
 Turn it up let it (bounce) 
 In the trunk let it (bounce) 
 Throw 'em up let it (bounce) 
 Yeah bitch, this is what we do when we verbally turn 'em out 
 With the speakers to the maximum, baby just let it bounce 
 Now, in a crowd let it, (bounce) turn it loud let it (bounce) 
 Blow 'em out let it (bounce) 
 Yeah bitch, this is what we do when I show 'em what I'm about 
 With the speakers to the maximum baby just let it bounce 
 It's that evil rap nemesis, puttin' together sentences 
 Faster than that hedgehog runnin' on Sega Genesis 
 Higher than the hooves of Pegasus, and let the pencil hit 
 The paper harder than a bus, Jerome Bettis it 
 Let it be said a bit with the excellent rhetoric 
 My vernacular's spectacular, step to me and I'll settle it 
 If mastery of language was the goal, then I'm ahead of it 
 You can't connect the checks that I'm cuttin' down in Connecticut 
 My flow is art, rib cage, got a soldier's heart 
 Verbally a double barrell shotty, leave you blown apart 
 I'm such an animal they kicked me off of Noah's Ark 
 'Cause they keep on comin' up shorter than Napoleon Bonaparte 
 Me? I'm a tall dude, never let you fall through 
 Hard as granite dammit, these bitches softer than dog food 
 Shoot 'em up, R2, drop so many bars you 
 Haters quit your job, cause there's nothin' to argue 
 Now let it 
 Yeah, all you motherfuckers 
 Turn it up let it (bounce) 
 In the trunk let it (bounce) 
 Throw 'em up let it (bounce) 
 Yeah bitch, this is what we do when we verbally turn 'em out 
 With the speakers to the maximum, baby just let it bounce 
 Now, in a crowd let it, (bounce) turn it loud let it (bounce) 
 Blow 'em out let it (bounce) 
 Yeah bitch, this is what we do when I show 'em what I'm about 
 With the speakers to the maximum baby just let it bounce 
 White boy rap sergeant, buzz bigger than Cartman 
 Mentally a menace, my brain's the size of a Martian's 
 Used to be broke as fuck at the mall lookin' for bargains 
 Now I got a gold card, cha ching, charge em' 
 Started off small now I do it for the masses 
 Spit it greater, incinerate em, burn 'em to ashes 
 Now these new college kids think that they can match it 
 Bitch I drop classics, all you droppin' is classes 
 Who needs Hofstra? Hip-Hops my donna school 
 Hotter than my mamas macaroni with some gaba gruel 
 Yeah I'm cocky as fuck, just bein' honest fool 
 Being modest isn't in a single molecule 
 In my whole body, who's touchin' me nobody 
 Now I'm up on iTunes takin' yo money 
 Give a shit my nose runny 'cause I spit it so sick 
 Now bounce turn it up in the whip, cause you know we gonna 
 Yeah, all you motherfuckers 
 Turn it up let it (bounce) 
 In the trunk let it (bounce) 
 Throw 'em up let it (bounce) 
 Yeah bitch, this is what we do when we verbally turn 'em out 
 With the speakers to the maximum, baby just let it bounce 
 Now, in a crowd let it, (bounce) turn it loud let it (bounce) 
 Blow 'em out let it (bounce) 
 Yeah bitch, this is what we do when I show 'em what I'm about 
 With the speakers to the maximum baby just let it bounce 
 I'm that dude with a 40 while everybody sippin' Rozay 
 No filter on my mouth, not a thing I won't say 
 Check the clocks like Coldplay, know what time it is 
 And my future still looking good like Marisa Tomei 
 Huh, beatin' me? no way, bitch you better ease up 
 Who needs a label? only thing I'm signin' is a prenup 
 I'm a beast why would I compete with these chumps 
 I'm an 8 ball, they only equal the key bump 
 Keep my bars hot, rappin' in the car lots 
 Private school trainin' at the school of hard knocks 
 They pop the hard rock, I'm makin' your jaw drop 
 So high, I'm up in the sky with Star Fox 
 Hip-Hop veteran, rockin' a weightless Letterman 
 Bad to the bone you can check my damn skeleton 
 Webby ready as ever you better let me in 
 Come on bounce let me tell em' again 
 So just 
 Yeah, all you motherfuckers 
 Turn it up let it (bounce) 
 In the trunk let it (bounce) 
 Throw 'em up let it (bounce) 
 Yeah bitch, this is what we do when we verbally turn 'em out 
 With the speakers to the maximum, baby just let it bounce 
 Now, in a crowd let it, (bounce) turn it loud let it (bounce)
