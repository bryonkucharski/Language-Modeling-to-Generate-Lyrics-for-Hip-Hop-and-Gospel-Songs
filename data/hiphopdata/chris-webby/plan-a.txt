Ay, ay ay 
 This is my inner struggle 
 Fighting through the game with every hit they cue the thunder 
 Ay, ay, ay 
 Feet don't fail me now 
 Every step I take, I hear "don't give up now" 
 Ay, ay, ay 
 Would you believe what I've been through 
 Sometimes I wonder what I get into 
 Ay, ay, ay 
 And so we always say 
 Fuck a plan B, everyday we gon' go for plan A 
 The mind plays tricks on a young artist 
 Like why they going the furthest but I'm working the hardest 
 Bombarded with comments by fans 
 Like "you the man but how come you still live in an apartment?" 
 Dirty carpet 
 Regardless the mic's on 
 Write songs to find my way through the darkness 
 I promise you don't want to start shit 
 Looking like I barely started but these rhymes ready for harvest 
 Office job wasn't meant for me 
 I'm meant to be on stage and the kids will scream 
 Rip the beat 
 Lyrics don't let me get to sleep 
 I partner and forget what I did achieve 
 History repeats itself 
 And I'll repeat myself 
 Until the day they fucking get it 
 I committed to spittin' everything I've ever written 
 It's worth a listen and sittin' 
 And that's the reason I'm trippin' 
 Not to mention I ain't never had a plan B 
 Family I got to support, don't want them in the damn streets 
 They're supportive 'cause they knowin' what I can be 
 A lot of goals but it's feeling like I can't reach 
 Can't speak on a lot of things 
 I'm hoping that they all work out 
 Until then I'm just chillin' with a pen 
 Droppin' songs every week and look how it all turns out 
 I was feeling burnt out 
 Now I'm feeling like it's go time 
 Give me the mic, boy, it's showtime 
 I did it on my own, no cosign 
 Cause other niggas, they got no rhymes 
 They wanna battle, then it's war crimes 
 I'll never be trapped in a box 
 Nigga watch when it drops 
 I'm-a get it on my own time 
 Ay, ay ay 
 This is my inner struggle 
 Fighting through the game with every hit they cue the thunder 
 Ay, ay, ay 
 Feet don't fail me now 
 Every step I take, I hear "don't give up now" 
 Ay, ay, ay 
 Would you believe what I've been through 
 Sometimes I wonder what I get into 
 Ay, ay, ay 
 And so we always say 
 Fuck a plan B, everyday we gon' go for plan A 
 Fuck plan B unless I came in it, bitch 
 Felt suicidal like I want a vein to be split 
 Want to quit 
 Couldn't tolerate the pain, it's a risk 
 Wife gon' bitch 'cause I ain't made shit 
 This the third job I done lost 
 I want to sleep the pain off, I need a Tylenol PM 
 I ran out of reasons for breathing 
 I'm fucked up 
 Can't let all the bullshit defeat him 
 Yeah, I'm still writing in my notepad 
 Holding on, damn, I ain't made no stacks 
 My kid can't eat those raps 
 I need a moment like Kodak 
 If I had a time machine I'd go back 
 Nigga just won't piece those on the [?] 
 Girl think I'm out here fucking these whores 
 I'm out here grinding 
 Damn bitch, you ain't know that 
 Plan A, fucking up the alphabet 
 I'm-a make it to the world, Jarren up next 
 I've done been through enough stress 
 Dead broke, fucked up, and upset 
 It's a must that I progress 
 Tryin' to cope with the bullshit I blow sess 
 The other day I was hopeless 
 Now I'm 'bout to go hard till my soul rests 
 Chasing my dream till I catch it 
 Been running so long that a nigga near breathless 
 Death to them haters, I put forth the effort 
 I kill all the doubt, now you niggas respect us 
 I'm 'bout to make billions flood out my wrists 
 Go hard till we die, we gon' fuck up this bitch 
 To you niggas that said I would never be shit: 
 Look at us now, you can go suck a dick 
 Ay, ay ay 
 This is my inner struggle 
 Fighting through the game with every hit they cue the thunder 
 Ay, ay, ay 
 Feet don't fail me now 
 Every step I take, I hear "don't give up now" 
 Ay, ay, ay 
 Would you believe what I've been through 
 Sometimes I wonder what I get into 
 Ay, ay, ay 
 And so we always say 
 Fuck a plan B, everyday we gon' go for plan A 
 Head's spinnin' like a fan blade 
 Give a fuck what I can or I can't say 
 Cause my end game looking so bright 
 That these people got to cover the microphone up with a damn lamp shade 
 Get a band-aid 
 'Cause I'm hurting you 
 Better learn not to take it personal 
 Shit, I paid my dues 
 Earned my stripes 
 Back up before I murder you 
 Not with a gun though 
 Just with these flows that I bust, yo 
 Better run home 
 I'm a god damn monster 
 Coming out when the sun's low 
 Let me keep it one-hundo 
 I've been out here grinding 
 No cosign but I kept on climbing 
 Did it on my own from text to freestyling 
 Shows to merchandise, still I'm writin' 
 'Bout to get it all wrapped up 
 Had enough of never having my cash up 
 So I followed plan A, no backup 
 Now I got the momentum of 20 mack trucks 
 Going downhill 
 And it's finally getting recognized and that feels 
 So damn good 
 'Cause I never sold out 
 Every step I just kept shit real 
 And really what more can you ask 
 Even if I'm not your musical preference 
 You gotta respect that 
 So just watch me as I live my dream 
 Pull up a seat and relax 
 Enjoy the show and watch me go 
 'Bout to give the whole game a smash
