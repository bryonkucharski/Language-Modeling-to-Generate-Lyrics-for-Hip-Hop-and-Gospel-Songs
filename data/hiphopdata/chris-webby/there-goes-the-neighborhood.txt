See I been grindin' for a long time man 
 But I'm here now--there goes the neighborhood I guess 
 You see I'm here to save the day with this music 
 Grindin' till the point I think I'm really going to lose it 
 But I won't lose nothing! They tryna step to me but shit 
 You think you could do better with it homie, then go and do somethin'! 
 Uh! They tryna tell me I'm crazy, but shit I'm crazy good 
 Step into your city they saying, "There goes the neighborhood" 
 For Sale signs go up soon as I show up 
 They building bomb shelters 'cause they know I'm gonna blow up 
 Uh! Bright future they say I'm a ticking time-bomb 
 Until I'm up on MTV waving, saying, "Hi Mom" 
 Grab your video cameras and get your Nikons 
 Making history from the second they flip the lights on 
 I made it off being business savvy and street smart 
 Who needs a co-sign? I let them beats talk 
 I don't need another rapper lendin' help 
 Tellin' listeners I'm dope as shit, I'll tell 'em that myself 
 I'm just playing what I'm dealt 
 Shit it's been a long road but I got a lot under my belt 
 And I've felt, at times, it was a lost cause 
 But I always got back up on my paws dawg 
 So I know I'm gonna make it in the long haul 
 Shit, it's now or never homie! I cannot starve 
 So I'm gonna reach up for the stars and I'll pray for the best 
 And that's how it's gonna be until the day of my death. Word 
 Just play and tune into this music 
 Have no fear I'll save the day with this music 
 My city on my back and I'mma take it 
 Wherever I go, wherever I go 
 Wherever I go, wherever I go 
 Say hello to the new guy in town 
 "There goes the neighborhood" is what they say 
 Twelve years in the making, far from immediate 
 But it's now to sink my teeth in it, I'm on my beastly shit 
 'Cause I'm sick as fuck, you don't believe me bitch? 
 Then go ahead and spit that semen on a petri dish 
 You need sterilizer just to give me dap 
 Unless you want your immune system attacked, real rap 
 I'm not doing no duggie 
 These fuckin' idiots should drop the swag and take notes 
 'Cause they could learn something from me 
 This is all I do man, murder instrumentals 
 With this fire off the top like Sweet Tooth in Twisted Metal 
 Spittin' rebel with a cause, deadly with the bars 
 Underdog since day one, wasn't expecting your applause 
 I respect your damn opinion if you don't like my music 
 But if you don't repect my hustle, then you ain't paying attention 
 I pay so many fucken dues my wallets empty 
 Ain't a person here stoppin' Webby. Motherfucker 
 Just play and tune into this music 
 Have no fear I'll save the day with this music 
 My city on my back and I'mma take it 
 Wherever I go, wherever I go 
 Wherever I go, wherever I go 
 Say hello to the new guy in town 
 "There goes the neighborhood" is what they say 
 Fuckin' animal, Webby's the Serengeti type 
 They whippin Lambos but I made it on a peddled bike 
 Not even Gatorade replenishes electrolytes 
 I burn growin' up from the fucken second I get the mic 
 I'm the grittiest, grimiest, and the wittiest 
 Jack the Ripper to the beats I'm gettin' busy with 
 And half these rapper idiots aren't even literate 
 I'm battle tested and ready, Webby a young Odysseus 
 Fire in my eyes and a hunger for success 
 I'm huntin' for the title while they huntin' for check 
 Wondering what's next but I'm going in fist swingin' 
 Till your ears ringin' they don't expect what this kid's bringin' 
 So if you didn't notice, so homie just don't provoke it 
 I got my state on my shoulders till I'm getting scoliosis, never gonna stop 
 My life's like the script of Verticle Limit motherfucker, I'm getting to the top! 
 Just play and tune into this music 
 Have no fear I'll save the day with this music 
 My city on my back and I'mma take it 
 Wherever I go, wherever I go 
 Wherever I go, wherever I go 
 Say hello to the new guy in town 
 "There goes the neighborhood" is what they say
