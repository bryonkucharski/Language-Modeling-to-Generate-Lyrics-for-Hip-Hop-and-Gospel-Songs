I started in the game on the grind and I still am 
 All of it off a sweat on my back without a deal man 
 Spit it real, and treat 'em like protected areas in Alaska 
 'Cause they about to know the drill man 
 So fuckin' illy that I got to pop a pill again 
 Adderall XR 20 or 30 milligrams 
 Gotta stay focused in the land of opportunity 
 Prepared for any twist and turn that anybody threw at me 
 Grew to be a beast learned it all up in the cypher 
 All off the top slaughtered 90% of you writers 
 Regardless of my fuckin' heritage and nationality 
 I grew up decapitating anybody who battled me 
 Rappin' rapidly ain't nobody be lappin' me 
 Jackie Joyner-Kersee 26 paces in back of me 
 An alcoholic but fuck it homie I'd rather be 
 Liquored up not givin' a fuck and livin' lavishly 
 On the go hard diet I burn calories 
 Setting fire to mics till the melted plastic and ash you see 
 I've lost my marbles somebody should straight jacket me 
 Latch it and throw the key in the deepest part of the blackest sea 
 Toss me on an island like fuckin' Survivor casted me 
 And still I'll make it back and make every hater a casualty 
 Running Connecticut shouts to my homie Apathy 
 And shouts to everyone who supported me on my path to be 
 Successful in one way or an other cause grammatically 
 They know no one could fuck with my metaphorical masterpiece 
 Got the fuckin' Grim Reaper coming after me 
 The good die young someone show me where the casket be 
 I keep on moving forward 
 With my head held high 
 I do this shit forever or at least until I die 
 Ain't no use in stopping 
 I got nothing left to hide 
 I do this shit forever 
 You couldn't stop me if you tried 
 Nobody fuckin' with my flow man 
 Modern day Conan, swords swingin' in both hands 
 Hip-Hop is all I know man 
 Bang bitches to Chronic 2001 motherfuckin' Slow Jam 
 Keep grindin' till the day that Webby holds the belt 
 Make my haters sit the fuck down, Franky Roosevelt 
 With that polio flow homie I'm dope as hell 
 Captain of my movement and I'm treatin' all of my soldiers well 
 My fans know I won't give rhymin' a rest 
 And I mean that, from the left side of my chest 
 I got heart, so all you motherfuckers step your game up 
 Me with a microphone is like Bob Ross with a paint brush 
 All you lame fucks gettin' pummeled from the waist up 
 I don't need a cheap shot to leave your raps laid up 
 Shane Mosley with punches fuckin' your face up 
 Eatin' at roofs Chris now let me raise the stakes up 
 I keep on moving forward 
 With my head held high 
 I do this shit forever or at least until I die 
 Ain't no use in stopping 
 I got nothing left to hide 
 I do this shit forever 
 You couldn't stop me if you tried 
 I keep on moving forward 
 With my head held high 
 I do this shit forever or at least until I die 
 Ain't no use in stopping 
 I got nothing left to hide 
 I do this shit forever 
 You couldn't stop me if you tried
