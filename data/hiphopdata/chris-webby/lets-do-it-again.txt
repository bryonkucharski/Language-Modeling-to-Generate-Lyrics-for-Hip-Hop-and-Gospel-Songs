I've had some of my best times chillin' at the bar yo 
 Doing stupid shit, that I won't remember tomorrow 
 Waking up confused, still wearing my shoes 
 Thinking back like Yoo What the fuck did I do?! 
 Nights like this started with a pre-game 
 Give me an auxiliary chord, now I'm the DJ 
 Playing what I wanna hear, none of the Pop shit 
 Give me the Big L, Wu Tang and Pac shit 
 Drinking till I'm buzzing like my phone's on vibrate 
 Taking another shot just to clear my mind state 
 Now I'm feeling good, never any less 
 So I'd like to welcome you to Project X 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 All you need is that 5 dollars for a cup and you can party till the sun comes up 
 12am: On the way to the house 
 5am: We'll be kicking y'all out 
 6am: We'll be falling asleep 
 By 10pm It's on me to do it again 
 Let's do it again 
 Let's do it again 
 Let's do it, Let's do it, Let's do it again 
 Let's do it again 
 Let's do it again 
 Let's do it, Let's do it, Let's do it again 
 And I don't wanna push my luck 
 'Cause I'm already so drunk 
 I just threw my dinner up (But fuck it) 
 I've been trained to be a weekend warrior 
 So the puke and rally move is in my wheelhouse, of course sir 
 Living on the border 
 There is no other option 
 Even if the memories we make are all forgotten 
 I'll be sipping my concoction 
 I'm mid twenties, drinking like I'm 18 back in high school 
 Is that a problem? 
 Na man, this is not a race 
 Imma have my fun now 
 And mature at my own pace 
 Cause for years I've been living this exact same way 
 I'm like Bill Murray in Groundhogs' day 
 12am: On the way to the house 
 5am: We'll be kicking y'all out 
 6am: We'll be falling asleep 
 By 10pm It's on me to do it again 
 Let's do it again 
 Let's do it again 
 Let's do it, Let's do it, Let's do it again 
 Let's do it again 
 Let's do it again 
 Let's do it, Let's do it, Let's do it again 
 It's getting late now, late as the night can 
 Girl under my left arm, bottle in my right hand 
 Everybody's drunk now, most of them are passed out 
 Reach into my back pocket and pull a bag out 
 Then finally the herb come around 
 Blunt ride back and burn the fuck down 
 Getting so high, that my contacts dry 
 Put the visine in my eyes 
 So go and live your lives, we'll only get to do it once 
 Have some fun with it yo 
 Everybody losing up, go and do some stupid stuff 
 Isn't that what's life about? 
 Man I'm having fun and if you're not, then you should try it out 
 12am: On the way to the house 
 5am: We'll be kicking y'all out 
 6am: We'll be falling asleep 
 By 10pm It's on me to do it again 
 Let's do it again 
 Let's do it again 
 Let's do it, Let's do it, Let's do it again 
 Let's do it again 
 Let's do it again 
 Let's do it, Let's do it, Let's do it again 
 12am: On the way to the house 
 5am: We'll be kicking y'all out 
 6am: We'll be falling asleep 
 By 10pm It's on me to do it again 
 Let's do it again 
 Let's do it again 
 Let's do it, Let's do it, Let's do it again 
 Let's do it again 
 Let's do it again 
 Let's do it, Let's do it, Let's do it again
