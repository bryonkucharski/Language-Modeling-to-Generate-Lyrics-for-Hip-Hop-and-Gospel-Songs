BarsTaLoan:] 
 Flying in the car, looking like a star, just like a galaxy 
 Go so hard like a callus be, uh 
 Burning more things than calories 
 [KID:] I see you homie, I see you. Working, huh?

 [BarsTaLoan:] What the fuck is that? 
 (Freestyle: Chris Webby) 
 Yo, it's Chris Webby 
 At this party and shit, motherfucker wants me to rap 
 I'm about to open an abortion clinic right next to your local church 
 And go to narcotics anonymous hustling coke and percs 
 I'm just trying to piss you off, I really hope it works 
 Go berzerk, I got a dirty mouth, I'll never hold a curse 
 Jerking off until my motherfucking shoulder hurts 
 Even if she vegan she gon swallow when my boner squirts 
 Help an older lady across the road, "hey can I hold your purse?" 
 Then kick her in front of a moving bus, "oh no, she's hurt!" 
 Shit I'm pretty sure she's dead but you can check yourself 
 While I run her wallet and spend all the money at Taco Bell 
 Anyone this deranged should surely be locked in jail 
 I'm on the grind but off the rails like an Eric Koston fail 
 I hit it rapid fire, try to pull out of a vaginal cavity 
 But busted while I was half inside her 
 Then I woke up in the morning and had a reminder 
 That she's getting plan B for breakfast with an apple cider 
 Someone pass the lighter, I need some weed to breathe in 
 He's a demon, dirty mind, sneaky heathen 
 I don't need a reason 
 I'm creeping up like sex offenders with binoculars on a beach in bikini season 
 You won't see me leaving, I'm running through that 
 Stomp you to death then throw my Nike's back on the shoe rack 
 Huh I'ma do that, why bother tryna bleach the blood stains out? 
 Somebody told me orange is the new black 
 So I scrub my white T till it turns the color copper 
 And use some Tide detergent and throw it up in the washer 
 I swear that I'm crazy though, shit you can ask my doctor 
 Psych, I'm off my rocker like an active grandfather, motherfucker 
 [WEBBY:] Your turn, bro 
 [BarsTaLoan:] I actually gotta save my voice for my open mic tomorrow, bro 
 [KID:] Oh man, get this coward out of here please. Please get this coward out of here... 
 [WEBBY:] Oh yeah? That's cool bro. Seriously. (to party) Who wants to get back to drinking?!?!
