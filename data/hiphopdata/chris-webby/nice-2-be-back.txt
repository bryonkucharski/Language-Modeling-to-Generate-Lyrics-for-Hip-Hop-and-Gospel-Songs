Hello, in a muscle car murdered out 
 With a purple ounce, that motherfucker that you heard about 
 Spread around the internet because of word of mouth 
 Cannonballed off the deep end and swam further out 
 Tryna stack absurd amounts with a purdy spouse 
 Put one in the air like Super Smash pulling Kirby out 
 Jury's out? Fuck it, I don't care I'ma vent 
 And get fucking intense like Native American sex 
 Fuck the money, when I started I was there for respect 
 That's why I'm still in Connecticut where my chariot rest 
 I'm on the edge, do y'all dare me to step? 
 Will y'all just find another rapper to rep and even care if I left? 
 Watched too many people run with my formula and get famous 
 Now all of 'em fucking famous and boy I'm just fucking waiting 
 Put my life up on the line for the glory that I've been chasing 
 Recording down in my basement, money poor but I was patient 
 Now I'm hustling and moving up, kid's super tough 
 I ain't popping? I tell 'em soon enough 
 I kept my circle tight, it never loosened up 
 And cut the snakes out like Medusa up at Super Cuts 
 It's my job to get up on mics and say wild shit 
 Never once did I suggest that you should try it 
 Shut your trap, I'ma need a little silence 
 Let me do my job, is that all right bitch? 
 Hello, it's so good to see you, it's so nice to be back 
 Gather up ladies and gentlemen, just vibe to the track 
 Grab a seat, dim the lights while I'm reciting this rap 
 Best in the burbs, let's remind 'em why my title is that 
 It's good to see you, it's so nice to be back! 
 I remember being lost and hopeless in my parent's attic 
 Feeling claustrophobic, but I never lost my focus 
 I'm back, hurting from a mix of mild scoliosis 
 And the weight of carrying the fucking state up on my shoulders 
 I'm on a marathon ahead of you, dude 
 They sucking wind, turning bluer than a jeopardy clue 
 The jealous ones developing resentment for the crew 
 Without knowing what I've been through 
 So come and step in these shoes 
 So what I didn't sell crack and had a stabler home life? 
 Middle class white, they been hating my whole life 
 But they saw me grow up just like Raven Symone, right? 
 Scrawny little punk, to the Razor Ramon type 
 Independent and continually making fans 
 Turned down a lot of deals, and chose to make a stand 
 Fuck selling out, homie that ain't the plan 
 Why push the envelope? I'm tackling the mail man 
 So here I am as I'm rambling, pants sagging 
 And ransacking the game, no receipt for the transaction 
 And they hopping right on to the band wagon 
 With this puff the magic dragon stuffed into a gram bag and 
 Attacking these beats thoroughly, in my prime currently 
 Only way to get me to shut my mouth is to murder me 
 Sure to be a legend, impressing with every story told 
 Go balls to the wall like I'm fucking y'all through a glory hole 
 My destiny is still an open book, just haven't had my moment 
 I'm still underrated and overlooked 
 But fuck it yo I feel terrific 
 We've already made it further than anybody predicted 
 Tapes on tapes with a handful of crazy tours 
 Led here, this the moment we been waiting for 
 To my fans, I'm extending my gratitude 
 Chemically Imbalanced, enjoy the fucking album dude
