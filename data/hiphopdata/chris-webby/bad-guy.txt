I'm the Hip-Hop antichrist, they'll regret it if they hand me mics 
 Jack The Ripper, huntin' bitches down by candle light 
 Changing the standard of nice, brandish a knife 
 I'm what's crackin' like I'm tightenin' ya hand in a vice 
 Huh! My flow nasty, get a Tampax 
 So many bars you would think I was flippin' Xanax 
 Fuck caterin' the bitches when I spit yo 
 Go and listen to Drizzy you dumb bimbo 
 This is real rappin' Webby flow it with a passion 
 Get these letters in my brain and cause a chemical reaction 
 Droppin' vowels and consonants, powerfully rockin' it 
 With enough force to level a continent 
 What I'm droppin' is the right way, I got em' guessin' what I might say 
 Go bananas like Johnny Drama and Andrew Dice Clay 
 Since the 9th grade Webby's been a psychopath 
 Headphones on in detention when I was writin' raps 
 Queue the lightnin' crash, queue the smoke machines 
 A factor you should fear, even Joe Rogan screams 
 Dopamine and adrenaline till I'm hemorrhagin' 
 The fuckin' villain's back in this bitch, you better remember him 
 Say good night to the bad guy 
 No fuckin' around, don't got to ask why 
 I'll be here until they bury me and that's why 
 They know to run when they see me 
 I'm the motherfucka haunting your dreams 
 I'm the motherfuckin' bad guy 
 No fuckin' around, don't got to ask why 
 I'll be here until they bury me and that's why 
 They no to run when they see me 
 I'm they motherfucka haunting your dreams 
 You can catch me where the wild things be at 
 Hit em' so quick they can't react, even an Atheist would believe that 
 Fuck shootin' guns, I fire cannon balls 
 With the physical strength of a Neanderthal 
 Roar! I'm a Tyrannosaurus Rex 
 Start by beatin' up the verses and I'll slam the chorus next 
 Got a standard for success and for me it's bein' the best 
 The games like a bench presser, let me get it off my chest 
 I'm a vet, but I ain't checkin' on the healthiness of any K-9s 
 I'm giving you the news bitch, NBC dateline 
 Hear me through the grapevine, murderin' tracks 
 Leave you layin' in the bed where they do surgeries at 
 I been the hottest dude under the sun 
 Beatin' me? You got a better chance fuckin' a nun 
 Fuck it I'm done, got my competition on the run 
 Won't be happy till I'm number one, deadly with the tongue 
 Rap bandito doing' coke by the kilo 
 The mad super villain is back, Magneto 
 So bow down to me or get eaten like sushi 
 So fuck you and have a great day, Yours truly 
 Say good night to the bad guy 
 No fuckin' around, don't got to ask why 
 I'll be here until they bury me and that's why 
 They know to run when they see me 
 I'm the motherfucka haunting your dreams 
 I'm the motherfuckin' bad guy 
 No fuckin' around, don't got to ask why 
 I'll be here until they bury me and that's why 
 They no to run when they see me 
 I'm they motherfucka haunting your dreams
