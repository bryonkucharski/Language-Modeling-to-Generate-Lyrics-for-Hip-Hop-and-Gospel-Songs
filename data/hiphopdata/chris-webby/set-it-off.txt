Yeah I'm about to set if off 
 Yeah I'm about to set if off 
 Yeah I'm about to set if off 
 Yeah I'm about to set if off 
 Untame on the mic, the dangerous type 
 And this is real life, it ain't just the way that I write 
 We can pour a drink, roll that mary jane up and light 
 So baby come to Webby's world, I'll make you famous tonight 
 Place your bets y'all gon' pay it in full 
 Never graduated from school but I made it this cool 
 Now I'm here motherfucker, ain't no April fools 
 Right to the top like I'm defying gravitational pull 
 'Cause I started young but I'm older now 
 Learned a lot up in the game, got a doper sound 
 Travelling around the world, getting cultured now 
 But still rolling with my dogs when I'm homeward bound 
 When I see Sap at the back of the weed spot 
 We gon get so fucking high that we pass it to Ewok 
 Then we turn it up so loud that the back of your seat rocks 
 From the very second that the beat drops 
 I'm about to set it off, yo, ready, set, go 
 If you tryna get it cracking let me know! 
 I'm about to set it off, whoa, bitches getting low 
 They be sweating when I be walking through the door 
 I'm about to set it off 
 Stay writing while rhyming and stage diving 
 All in, going so hard I could break diamonds 
 I been patiently waiting but learned that it takes time 
 And now I got the same look in my eye as a caged lion 
 I been on my hustle why the fuck you think I'm doing this? 
 Book of rhymes thicker than a Tarantino movie script 
 Rolling up a doobie and we jumping in the Uber whip 
 Until the driver take me to the top, I'm bout to do this shit 
 So animated, call me Bugs Bunny 
 Since I used to battle cats for they lunch money 
 Always had the same clothes, looking duck funny 
 Straight dummy but Webby was never dumb, buddy 
 I knew I'd have my moment, so let me soak it in 
 With your chick and, uh, some of her closest friends 
 'Cause they know it now if they didn't know it then 
 Now it's time to let the show begin! 
 I'm about to set it off, yo, ready, set, go 
 If you tryna get it cracking let me know! 
 I'm about to set it off, whoa, bitches getting low 
 They be sweating when I be walking through the door 
 I'm about to set it off 
 Yeah I'm about to set if off 
 Yeah I'm about to set if off 
 Yeah I'm about to set if off 
 Yeah I'm about to set if off
