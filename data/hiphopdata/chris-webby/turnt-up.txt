 C Web in the booth and I speak it real 
 Got another beat to kill 
 And I be roasting motherfuckers 
 Rest In Peace Patrice O'Neil 
 Roll up another blunt 
 Now how that Diesel feel? 
 Got me swerving man 
 Who the fuck gave me the wheel? 
 Who the fuck gave me these pills? 
 Now I'm off in another dimension 
 In need of an intervention 
 Cause these drugs are too fucking expensive 
 But I'm feeling terrific dude 
 Banging these broads with no fucking protection 
 Yeah, what were you saying babe? 
 I wasn't paying any fucking attention 
 Rumbling engine, rolling up in my Camaro and cruise 
 Living it like a pirate man 
 Always got me a barrel of booze 
 Skipping the food 
 Go right for the tiramisu 
 Sippin' and rippin' the bubbler 
 Puffing until I can barely move 
 Lay back and then stare at the moon, ooh 
 Bippidy bobbidy boo 
 Webby be rippin' it properly too 
 Hipping and hopping and rambling shit 
 Cause these pills I've been popping have got me confused 
 Screwed up, burn it down 
 Light it up, pass it around 
 I'm a bad boy bitch 
 You didn't know? You know it now 
 We just doin' what we doin', and we'll never give a fuck 
 Put some liquor in my bottle and some ganja rolled up 
 We just livin' like whatever and we'll never have enough 
 Bout to get this motherfucker turned up (turned up) 
 Like nah nah nah 
 Nah nah nah, nah nah nah 
 Nah nah nah 
 Nah nah nah, nah nah nah

 I'm not the one you want a problem with 
 Positive, you better follow it 
 Swear I'm ready for whatever standing in front of my mirror 
 Supporting my confidence 
 A little weed, you could throw it on top of this 
 We get it poppin', yo bitch gettin' topless 
 Now that you know, niggas adopting the flow 
 Niggas can't stop this shit 
 The problem is we won't acknowledge it 
 But me and Webby (I wanna get that) 
 If that nigga wanna get mad, sit up and get up 
 And fuck that (get that) 
 Now I'm playing like a kid on the black top 
 Got the juice with a flat top 
 You got a flat face 
 Bad boy, it's a bad day 
 Look at me sideways, and I'mma hit you with a uppercut 
 Too cold, better bundle up 
 Huddle up 'cause we comin' up 
 Turnt up, finna fuck it up 
 I guarantee that the crowd go crazy 
 When I hit the stage, you could bet a hunnit bucks 
 Boy we out here grindin' 
 Smoking the finest, getting the highest 
 Getting the mommas, you know when I'm coming 
 Just smell for the ganja 
 Vegas; soldierz, takin' over 
 Traveling and taking shots 
 Tattoo shops, don't forget the place to rock 
 I need a nasty girl to taste the cock 
 In the office, running all over these niggas 
 Like bitches, you niggas is softer than niggas 
 That just got to prison, this Project X shit is real 
 Somebody pass the god damn liquor 
 We just doin' what we doin', and we'll never give a fuck 
 Put some liquor in my bottle and some ganja rolled up 
 We just livin' like whatever and we'll never have enough 
 Bout to get this motherfucker turned up (turned up)

 That rap phenomenon 
 Inked up, looking like Comic Con, Rasta mon 
 H.A.M. on the mic, no Ramadan 
 Go on and on, and leave with a soccer mom 
 'Cause I kill that beat 
 Roll one up in that Swisher Sweet 
 Sticky green, sticky green 
 With orange hairs, like Pete and Pete 
 Flowing double time when I freak the beat 
 Holding up mine when I hit the street 
 Burn so much, I be high for weeks 
 Spit it so dirty, I need new sheets 
 My grinder's full, and I ain't talkin' turkey, cheese 
 I'm talking AK47, Purple Kush and Sour D 
 Put it in the bowl, I'll get a dutchie rolled 
 Sprinkle some keef on it, and then away we go 
 Get in the flow, lighting up heady to dro 
 Partying on, got that confetti to throw 
 Killing the spot from the moment 
 That Webby'll step in the door 
 Hit some shit, got my pencil gripped 
 Instrumental ripped, living life 
 Above the law, and way under the influence 
 Getting mine while the price high 
 What can I say? I'm pretty fly for a white guy 
 We just doin' what we doin', and we'll never give a fuck 
 Put some liquor in my bottle and some ganja rolled up 
 We just livin' like whatever and we'll never have enough 
 Bout to get this motherfucker turned up (turned up)
