You let me violate you 
 You let me desecrate you 
 You let me penetrate you 
 You let me complicate you 
 Help me 
 I broke apart my insides 
 Help me 
 I've got no soul to sell 
 Help me. 
 The only thing that works for me 
 Help me get away from myself 
 I want to fuck you like an animal 
 I want to feel you from the inside 
 I want to fuck you like an animal 
 My whole existence is flawed 
 You get me closer to God 
 You can have my isolation 
 You can have the hate that it brings 
 You can have my absence of faith 
 You can have my everything 
 Help me 
 Tear down my reason 
 Help me 
 It's your sex I can smell 
 Help me 
 You make me perfect 
 Help me become somebody else 
 Through every forest 
 Above the trees 
 Within my stomach 
 Scraped off my knees 
 I drink the honey inside your hive 
 You are the reason I stay alive
