I feel the warmth of morning light 
 But I'm still cold inside 
 The touch can't take the loneliness away 
 With you sleepin' in my arms 
 Wanna keep you safe from harm 
 But I can't protect our love from what my heart has to say 
 Though you still look the other way 
 I can't go on pretending one more day 
 Forgive me 
 'Cause I never meant to hurt you 
 I always believed in love 
 And I only wish that was enough 
 Forgive me 
 'Cause I didn't wanna say it 
 But I can't live a lie 
 Though it breaks my heart to say goodbye 
 As a tear falls from your eye 
 You keep asking why 
 Though I know you've held the answer deep inside 
 You say isn't this worth fighting for 
 But I can't fight with you at all 
 Time has changed us both 
 And I can't be the man you want anymore 
 I just can't look the other way 
 Why would you keep pretending another day 
 And thought we still have so much love 
 We couldn't help but grow apart 
 And there's no way for us to turn back from where we are 
 So when we walk away 
 I'm gonna pray 
 That one day you will see 
 Forgive me 
 'Cause I never meant to hurt you 
 I always believed in love 
 And I only wish that was enough 
 Forgive me 
 'Cause I didn't wanna say it 
 But I can't live a lie 
 Though it breaks my heart to say goodbye 
 Forgive me 
 'Cause I never meant to hurt you 
 I always believed in love 
 And I only wish that was enough 
 Forgive me 
 'Cause I didn't wanna say it 
 But I can't live a lie 
 Though it breaks my heart to say goodbye
