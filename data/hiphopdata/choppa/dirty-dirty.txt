Chorus (repeat 2) 
 If you ride on 20 inch dubs (you dirty dirty) 
 If your baby momma taken a cup (you dirty dirty) 
 If you showin' gold teeth when you talk (you dirty dirty) 
 Say what?(you dirty dirty) say what?(you dirty dirty) 
 Now I'm a dirty old south boy 
 And you can tell by the way I spit it out my mouth boy 
 I'm gumbo funk hot and spicy with a clout boy 
 A west bank representin' is what I'm bout boy I'm bout boy 
 You can catch me ridin' down on your block on dub deuces 
 Right through that magnolias where they love 
 Now I'm a dirty old south boy 
 And I know you know that I bought it from the bootleggers I bought it from the store 
 I'm dirty like the look on ya face when you see I'm ponked 
 It's a low down dirty shame 
 Yal shouldn't of ever let lil Choppa step up in the game 
 'Cause I'mma flip it 
 Why all you niggas that's runnin' them same bitches that you fucked last year 
 Got them hoes on ice like them bitches were beer 
 Gettin' mad 'cause it's niggas like me she will serve me 
 Hatin' on choppa style now you know that's dirty 
 New Orleans what's up? Represent your dirty dirty 
 ATL what's up? Represent your dirty dirty 
 Houston, Texas what's up? Represent your dirty dirty 
 Mississippi what's up? Represent your dirty dirty 
 Down south what's up? Represent your dirty dirty 
 Midwest what's up? Represent your dirty dirty 
 Up north what's up? Represent your dirty dirty 
 Eastside what's up? Represent your dirty dirty
