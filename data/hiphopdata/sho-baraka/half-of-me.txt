Half of me just walked away 
 And the other half is trying not to stay 
 Help me see the hope that's past the rain 
 Restore the joy within me and 
 Speak to me through the pain 
 This kind of news would make a grown man cry 
 The kind of man who knows the answers but he still asks why 
 Why are you down cast oh my soul 
 My team expects so much from me, I can't let them know 
 That I'm not finding joy and my faith's dying slow 
 I gotta go on preaching I gotta go on with the show 
 Gotta grace the stage, I gotta make the crowd say oh 
 Only problem is I'm not believing in the words I flow 
 So I look to sky I know the hour has come 
 Please remove this thorn from me 'cause my soul feels numb 
 I got these liars in my head asking where my faiths gone 
 I don't feel happy and I don't even care to fake for them 
 They think me showing pain is the denial of Christ 
 Because my tears up in my food all day and night 
 Half of me hopes in the Lord and knows I'll praise again 
 The other half wants an excuse to wallow in my sin 
 They say count it all joy, I got questions about how 
 There's answers after death but I need answers right now 
 I know this to shall pass, whether slow or fast 
 Loosen my grip on the world and for you I grasp (2x) 
 He feels he fled temptation to long, so He's tried of fighting 
 He no longer finds his marriage exciting 
 She's drowning in depression in the rain 
 She can't maintain, Lord can you help her ease the pain 
 A father gets news that his newborn son has complications 
 He has no idea what he's faced with 
 He thinks no prom, no college, no athletic fun 
 No matter his disabilities I'm not ashamed of my son 
 Lord I pray with all my heart that when his life on earth is done 
 He'll understand that you and the son are one 
 One families prays together for financial needs 
 Father feels inadequate 'cause he ain't worked in weeks 
 He been laid off he may loose his car and home 
 He thinks what good is a man who can't provide for his own 
 He sees the pain in wife and children's eyes 
 Contemplating suicide 'cause dead men don't cry 
 Lord give him eyes to see past the pain 
 That his value in life, shouldn't come with things 
 I know this to shall pass, whether slow or fast 
 They are losing their grip I hope for you they grasp (2x) 
 I won't let this current pain master me 
 What is pain actually 
 Lets not address it causally but I don't want to fear pain 
 Lets count it all joy its is gain 
 Dear life is in my palms and I'm holding on 
 Strength is an illusion right along with this calm that I'm on and I'm feeling far gone- 
 Cause half of me is hoping that my eyes won't open in morn' 
 Sorrow is my tongue hear my moans 
 I'm eager for redemption but I know 
 There's more than meets the eye to the thorns in my side 
 So I cry refusing all the lies 
 Pain is my ally when aligned to who you are 
 There's more to my scars so I know there's more to yours 
 I'm resting in your arms 
 I'm resting in the your wrists 
 I'm pressing with a limp pain is purposed through your gift 
 I'm strengthening my grip may this faith in you persist 
 And when this half insists I pray you breathe in me lament 
 Amazing is your grace cause while I'm holding you it seems 
 The truth of the matter is your really holding me
