Iiiiiiiii 
 Just wanna make you famous 
 Just wanna make you famous 
 I, I, I began to reach for the stars 
 Then I saw a star who reached for the cross 
 Then I saw the crowd they were screaming at the screen 
 Like crucify the King yeah, the man in between 
 Crushed bones, blood dripping off his face 
 Framed on wood now that's a picture of grace 
 But the sequel comes a couple days later 
 We saw the father strike the son something like darth vader 
 Looking for a stunt man who can conquer the fall 
 Must take hits and must have no flaws 
 Did his work and time in a coffin then split 
 I guess that's what you call a real box office hit 
 Praise God it was Jesus and 12 on the Scene 
 That would makes his life pg-13 
 Yeah I get choked up see it 
 But go buy the book you'll understand when you read it 
 No glitter no glam but my team still shines bright 
 Where ever you catch us I hope we flashing the light 
 Bearing our crosses just to get our passions right 
 Jim Caviziel on 'em we want to act like Christ 
 With every act I want to make 'em known 
 For Every crack of with whip for every punch that was thrown 
 Our Street team is punching the clock 
 Whether you on Wall Str. or you're hitting the block 
 On the backstreets building with the fam 
 But we All 'n' sync looking like a boy band 
 He's the man plus a hard act to follow 
 Only way to heaven he's a one way model 
 The creator of the stars took the low road 
 Could have been a king could have been a Pharaoh 
 Yeah he did it make us blameless 
 So now my only job is to make him famous
