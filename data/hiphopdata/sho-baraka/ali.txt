I'm tryin' to be great and I'm on my way 
 Way up, way up, way up 
 It's never too late and I'm on my way 
 (I'ma leave my mark, ready set go 
 Ready set go, ready set go) 
 Hello greatness I'm here to greet you 
 False humility and doubt had me scared to meet you 
 Fear had me I couldn't sleep I lay awake 
 Felt like I had to put my dreams up on layaway 
 That's the thoughts of a kid living on welfare 
 Section 8 monthly food stamps government healthcare 
 Depressed hopin' the do'hood would suck less 
 From our house we had a poor view of success 
 Let it be told all that glitters ain't gold 
 Life is a slam dunk when you livin' with low goals 
 Pick and roll with a number of great friends 
 Some want you to be great but not greater than them 
 Never lust for the top, love it's a long fall 
 Climbed the ladder of success on the wrong wall 
 It's by working faith, it's the Lord's grace 
 Mediocre is contagious, give me some space, space 
 I'm tryin' to be great and I'm on my way 
 Way up, way up, way up 
 It's never too late and I'm on my way 
 Way up, way up, way up 
 (I'ma leave my mark, ready set go 
 Ready set go, ready set go) 
 Ha, I'm like hold up can I dream? 
 Everybody's dreaming but not me 
 Imago Dei His masterpiece is so vivid 
 You know the architect homeboy we in the buildin' 
 No ceiling prayers tear the roof off 
 Talk to God via text you got a new call 
 Fans will exalt ya, haters wanna stone ya 
 Man will always fail ya keep ya eyes on Jehovah 
 I'm sayin' great I'm trying to push my brothers 
 Talented tenth, that service for the good of others 
 Some know a lot, say a lot with no application 
 Success is mistress, his procrastination 
 Greatness is like Bach on the keys, Ali in the ring 
 Like King havin' a dream 
 Huh, it's like Mueller on his knees, Tolstoy with a pen 
 A Messiah without sin 
 Hello faith, goodbye doubt 
 I met greatness on my way out 
 Never give up, never give up, never give up 
 Hello faith, goodbye doubt 
 I met greatness on my way out 
 Never give up, never give up, never give up 
 I'm tryin' to be great and I'm on my way 
 Way up, way up, way up 
 It's never too late and I found my way 
 (I'ma leave my mark, ready set go 
 Ready set go, ready set go) 
 I'm tryin' to be great and I'm on my way 
 Way up, way up, way up 
 It's never too late, I know I'll be great
