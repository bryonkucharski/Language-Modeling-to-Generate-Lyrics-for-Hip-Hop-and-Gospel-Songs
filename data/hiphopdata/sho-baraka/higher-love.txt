I'm In love, I'm in Love 
 With a Higher Love, Higher Love 
 You've been aching for a while here is something to make you smile 
 We repping him proud as the worlds looking around for a (Higher Love 3x) 
 I'm in love with the captain of the ship 
 When the waves get to rockin' the boat 
 We walk on water like he taught us to float 
 I got the scriptures to quote and when it seems like your boy can't cope 
 We got a team tight like three strand rope it ain't easily broke 
 The mountain in front may seem un-climbable 
 But after his work on the cross it would seem irresponsible 
 If we threw in the towel because of life's small obstacles 
 Yeah we know a GOD who makes the unlikely possible 
 His phenomenal love and holiness ain't optional 
 So the world looks at us like were so illogical 
 Keep our face in the word to be a godly influence 
 If you really want to know here's the reason why I do this 
 He vacated heaven to take the form of a man 
 If you love the LORD then throw up you hands and sing it with me (I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love) 
 I'm in love with the Lion of Judah 
 Not myself, Mohammed, Krishna or Buddha 
 He got a saving word it's like a computer 
 Now I excel 'cause my idea of love came in the form of a bottle or the form of a model, or the thugs that I followed 
 But now I walk in the spirit, I exalt him with lyrics, it's the music of life I pray that you hear it 
 I got a listeners ear, it ain't nothing but worshippers here 
 We walk the valley of death with nothing to fear 
 We got the love of GOD ain't nothing but love for my squad 
 Its real community it ain't a facade. 
 Actions reflecting his grace, stay humble when we're seeking his face 
 You may hear this when you step in the place 
 I've been burned by the world and it showed not sympathy 
 I would give my all and it stripped my of my dignity 
 Stripped my of reason, my morals and my temper 
 Stripped me of everything I was in love with a stripper 
 But I love my physician he's a true life giver 
 I was dying but the doctor gave me his liver 
 In the form of his son with is arms spread wide 
 Ready to receive any boy, girl lady or guy 
 No matter their age I find more people try 
 To find real love in some girl or guy 
 But love is sacrificial, love is an action 
 Love ain't fleeting love is everlasting 
 Love our enemy, love our neighbor 
 Love to imitate Christ 'cause hes our savior 
 It cast out all fear 'cause love is our job 
 Love is eternal, love is our God
