What I look like caring if the world don't feel us 
 I serve a God who died harder than Bruce Willis 
 Man's born sick and he just gets ill'er 
 In our optimistic prime he could transform a killer 
 He could transform a dealer, ask Json 
 We were all born sinners, ask my mom 
 My nature's no better than Judas and that's the truth 
 Without the spirit I'm a arrogant adulterous dude 
 So I keep accountability until I get old 
 Tedashii said, "Bring the heat 'cause the world's so cold" 
 I gotta live 100 so my feet don't slip 
 I gotta live like Jacob more holy less hip 
 By His grace, Sho Baraka gon' spit the real 
 Been doing that Reach life before I got the deal 
 Called to make mini-me's till the day that I die 
 So on my tombstone say, "he didn't die, he multiply" 
 I gotta keep it (100) 
 My men keep it (100) 
 My ladies keep it (100) 
 We gotta keep it (100) 
 Back in the year of the 2 triple 0 
 This random thug tried to strong arm the Sho 
 Me and my boys on the corner just sharing our faith 
 This cat staring at us like he got something to say 
 He began to size us up acting tough talking loud 
 I tried to ignore him but this fool attracted a crowd 
 I expected some resistance but this ain't what I wanted 
 I had 99 problems this made 100 
 He looked me in the face and said if you love that Christ, 
 You'll have no problem with me sending you to see him tonight 
 I'm thinking option number one is we can turn the other cheek 
 Number 2 is we can stomp his loud mouth in the street 
 But that's what they want to see us fail when they test us, 
 Talk a good game but then crack under pressure 
 So I prayed to GOD, if I have to take this L 
 I hope out of this you would get your glory as well 
 So this cat stared at us for a second or two 
 Jumped at us and smirked like I'm playing with you 
 I have to represent the Lord even though they were stuntin 
 No matter what they do we gotta keep it 100 
 I gotta keep it (100) 
 My men keep it (100) 
 My ladies keep it (100) 
 We gotta keep it (100) 
 They move their lips but their words mean nothing 
 They think God got their back but them boys just frontin 
 They talk loud but we can drown out the sickest boys 
 We like Chicago, willing to make the ill'er noise 
 They want toys, fame, wealth, and health 
 Everything good without being good themselves 
 They want things but it's Jesus they better get 
 'Cause hell's their life sentence like a subject and a predicate 
 Sometimes I see the wicked and I lust for their things 
 But then I see the Lord and I trust in the King 
 Hung on the cross for hours while still in his prime 
 We don't call him heir for nothing, he showed us hang time 
 He is holy, He is perfect, He is God 
 God is like three in one, it's so odd 
 Because of all this your boy gotta keep running 
 99 wont do it gotta keep it 100 
 I gotta keep it (100) 
 My men keep it (100) 
 My ladies keep it (100) 
 We gotta keep it (100)
