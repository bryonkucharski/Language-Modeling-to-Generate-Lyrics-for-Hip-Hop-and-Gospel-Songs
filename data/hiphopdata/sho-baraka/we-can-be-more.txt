(Intro - J.R.) 
 We can be more, lady we can be more 
 We can be more, lady we can be more 
 (Verse 1 - Sho Baraka) 
 Yeah you stepped in, God healed my heartache 
 And this is way past lust, no prom date 
 And we can be a sweet aroma, Scrangie 
 And they can call us outcast, Andre 
 Told my boys yeah catch me I'm fallin' 
 You are on my team even when I ain't ballin' 
 You are patient with your boy in the worst case 
 I was like 9/11, the worst date 
 You been runnin' through my mind, first place 
 Those other girls they weak like Thursday 
 This is gentlemen's music, boys to men 
 I'm done with that player's life, born again 
 We'll be joined in body and soul 
 Heart and mind, money and time 
 If she's chocolate or vanilla or you're buttersctoch crème 
 She the only one for you, she should make you wanna sing 
 (Chorus - J.R.) 
 Girl you know you got my heart 
 And you know I love you so much 
 This is more than lust 
 You and I can become us 
 We've known each other for a while 
 And I know you say we just friends, but 
 We can be more, lady we can be more 
 We can be more, lady we can be more 
 (Verse 2 - Sho Baraka) 
 You got me feelin' like a 6th grader, that's fo' sho' 
 Do you wanna be my wife? Check yes or no 
 It's hard to stay pure in this dirty world 
 Everybody wants them a little dirty girl 
 They consult the pigs for a quick referral 
 They lookin' for the shells when they have a pearl 
 You can be Coretta, I can be your king 
 We can get together, we can have a dream 
 I could be the Rev, you could be Justine 
 We can walk this way or we can run as a team 
 And you ain't gotta wonder in your mind 
 God's on our side, I see the ribbon in the sky 
 Huh, now tell them jokers bye-bye 
 You've found real love, Mary J. Blige 
 If you know love is more than a ring 
 Grab your lady by the hand, this'll make you wanna sing 
 (Verse 3 - Sho Baraka) 
 A lifelong fight, that's what marriage is 
 Make love, not war like a terrorist 
 My playboy past is so embarrasin' 
 But your love got me goin' crazy, call a therapist 
 Yeah, girl you know it's a problem when 
 You got me feelin' lines from the Songs of Solomon 
 Yeah, you got a classy appeal 
 But you're also so fine, I just gotta keep it real 
 I know beauty is alive 
 Peacocks may try, they don't know you fly 
 Yeah, now go ahead and touch the sky 
 And bring my heart back when it's time to swing by 
 (Outro - Sho Baraka & J.R.) 
 Clap, you make a brother wanna sing 
 Step, you make a brother wanna sing 
 We can be more, lady we can be more 
 We can be more, lady we can be more 
 Yeah, now look that lady in the eye 
 Yeah, now look that lady in the eye 
 Tell her we can be more, lady we can be more 
 We can be more, lady we can be more
