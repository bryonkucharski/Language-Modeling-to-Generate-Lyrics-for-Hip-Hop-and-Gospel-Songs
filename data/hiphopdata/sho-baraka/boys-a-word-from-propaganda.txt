OK so, apparently for centuries, we've all had it backwards 
 And to admit it would be career suicide, these may just be my last words 
 Rapping prior records earns far more respect than degrees do 
 And now, the marks of manhood is how well you fail as one Boys! 
 Maybe you got time to waste 
 Posted up like a teen drinking beer by the case 
 In which case, it ain't an issue, I ain't so judgmental 
 It really ain't my biz, it's just now where I is Boys! 
 Jobless, tasteless, laziness, fatherless, but why should young care when 
 50 promise mommas if you have a baby by him you could be a millionaire 
 Toss your toys in the air Boys! 
 Go on and drown your sorrows in greed 
 And scheme to get rich to hide your insecurities Boys! 
 I ain't got time to explain how dumb makin' it rain is 
 Your rent's due homie and of course that child support, young 
 I'm a man, I refuse, I won't stop 
 My unborn sons won't rep a cell block 
 And when the options of aspiration is some combination of 
 Criminal or athlete, actor or rapper Boys! 
 I know saying this might be alarming but 
 No king is saved by the strength of his army Boys! 
 Them is God's words Boys! 
 And when you become a man, you put away childish things 
 If only you knew what man means Boys! 
 Silly Boys!
