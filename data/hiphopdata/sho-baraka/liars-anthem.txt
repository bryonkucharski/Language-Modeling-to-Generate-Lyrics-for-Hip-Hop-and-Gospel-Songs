 I step outta the front door 
 Music is inflating my ego 
 It's hard to just let go 
 Beats bangin' thoughts in my torso 
 The streets then repeat it like echoes 
 The picture that's painted, 
 It makes me wanna live life dangerous 
 It makes me wanna be rich and famous 
 I know it ain't righteous 
 But they make it look so enticing 
 It attacks my ears like it's Tyson, 
 Takes a bite of my conscience 
 Watch me bob my head to some nonsense 
 Rob, steal, kill, and speak bondage 
 I could be truthful, I used to be silent 
 But its got your boy straight fillin' with violence 
 I'm using the ladies, I used to respect them 
 And now your boy say anything just to sex them 
 I used to modest, I used to be honest 
 Now I do anything to get those dollars 
 'Cause I love...

 Record execs make a killin', 
 "Yeah we could pay you in millions" 
 Cash to the ceiling, don't trust your conviction or feelin' 
 You'll be just misleading some children 
 Their parents will blame you 
 You communicate what you've been through 
 They don't understand you're a black dude 
 And one that does rap too 
 They just complain and they hassle 
 They would do it too if they had to 
 You just make paper, we don't need to know where it came from 
 You didn't make the rope which they hang from 
 Cocaine and that handgun, everyone there saw 'em the same bruh 
 But this is the country of freedom 
 You can have women, you can have diamonds 
 This is what sells, greed, sex, drugs, and violence 
 Package these items, for people to buy them 
 And one day you would be an executive giant 
 Produce and sell...

 Pimpin', pimpin', pimpin', murder, murder, sell drugs (Paul) 
 Who's at fault for ignoring Paul shootin' right for them Jordans 
 'Cause Nike extortin' the loyalty of poor man's emotions 
 Without them they feel less important 
 And how about athletes, they come from the same back-streets 
 And they could make them shoes a lot more cheap 
 And how about rappers, they boast about evil 
 They say the same stuff they got copied from Kinko's 
 And what are the wealthy, that keep on complainin' 
 They ask for legislation and they think that will change men 
 And how about churches, they become obsolete 
 They call more meetings just to talk about outreach 
 And have more workshops, and hear more men speak 
 And just repeat all the deep thoughts a dead man inked 
 Who's without blame here, I guess we're all guilty 
 In the core of man's heart, yeah were all filthy 
 Man has no standards, he thinks he has answers 
 We all got disease and it's much worse than cancer 
 He speaks with the father, he wants your allegiance 
 He plays God's role, yeah it's like we don't need him 
 But he hates...
