The eyes of man are never satisfied 
 I want it I want it I gotta have it gotta have it 
 I'm just talking right now 'cause I like to hear myself talk 
 That's part of my issue 
 I know and I admit it 
 What's yours? 
 Yeah. Ok. This is bad, something close tragic 
 I'm trying to beat it just like Michael Jackson 
 My flesh seeks for satisfaction 
 Spirit reigns, titans start clashing 
 I got people thinking I'm confused 
 But I'm not, well maybe a little what am I to do 
 It takes years- for man to build a name 
 One selfish moment-turns it all to shame 
 I work hard- just for them to envy me 
 But in the end I'm not who I pretend to be 
 Lord help, this could be the end of me 
 What do I do when I sleeping with the enemy 
 Yeah he's slick he's smooth 
 I don't really trust him with ladies in the room 
 He's selfish he's scarred so many lives 
 Look in his eyes, can't wait for his demise 
 You're a lie, you're a jerk, you're a creep 
 So prideful, arrogant and weak 
 Lord help this might be the end of me 
 What do I do when I'm sleeping with the enemy 
 I run from, run from (Me myself and I) 
 I love some, love some (Me myself and I) 
 Run from, run from (Me myself and I) 
 Run from, run from (Me myself and I) 
 Run from, run from (Me myself and I) 
 I can't run I can't hide 
 I try to kill him he won't die 
 I've studied too much of what the vultures do 
 Trying not to reproduce what the culture do 
 I'm a grown man I ain't gotta prove I'M COOL 
 But first what's the price of those louis shoes 
 That would look so nice with some glowing jewels 
 Hold up do you see what I be going through 
 Yeah he gives manna for the day 
 Contentment on my face, but then I see my neighbors plates 
 He got a new job, and a new crib 
 Candy painted, cool whip 
 Say homie, I don't need it 'cause my friends bought it 
 No, I'll take it if my friends got it 
 I know its sad, death by fashion 
 Makes sure its brand name when you toe tag him 
 Oh my situation is deep 
 Always trying to create a person I can't be 
 We go in debt just to buy 
 Stuff to impress people that we don't like 
 I'm at war now, But I mma go home 
 Until he touch down we have some field goals 
 I gotta clique I gotta team 
 Share my weakness, that authentic thing 
 Know the Lords grace not my own might 
 Man can't have everything in man's sight 
 I know Sho and his tendencies 
 That joker just might be the end of me
