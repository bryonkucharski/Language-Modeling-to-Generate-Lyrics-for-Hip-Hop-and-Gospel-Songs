(Chorus - Quiana Fields) 
 Holy 
 Holy 
 Holy 
 Holy 
 Holy is the Lord 
 (Verse 1 - Sho Baraka) 
 Cast down my crown to worship you in spirit and truth 
 As I see you on the throne I see your train fills the roof 
 I'm on bended knees, hands extended, closed eyes 
 Holy holy holy is Lord the Most High 
 Woe is me, I'm a man with unclean lips 
 And I live amongst a people who's on the same trip 
 Then a seraph flew to me with coal in his hands 
 He touched me on my lip, said I was a brand new man 
 As the foundation shook, he's askin' "Who shall I send?" 
 I said "send me Lord, I'll commit to faithful men" 
 Sometimes Lord, I feel like I don't give you enough 
 To count a pure joy to persevere when times get tough 
 So I keep a heart's devotion that's fixed on you 
 I keep my eyes on the cross so I can have the right view 
 I'm in awe of you, how you measured the earth with your hand 
 And yet still you wanna be friends with such an unclean man 
 So like John I fall prostrate on this island of life 
 I worship you, recognizing you are power and might 
 Glory and light, eternal in sight, blameless and right 
 Creator of life, thief in the night, Jesus the Christ 
 (Verse 2 - Sho Baraka) 
 You gave us a tongue, we use it for lies 
 You gave us a heart, we fill it with pride 
 You gave us our minds, we use it for lust 
 You made us for one, we're doin' too much 
 Satan's plan was to bring a schism, to bring division 
 Between God and us, we want the Lord's position 
 We hate the architect, we want what you drew up 
 You give us enough, we want something newer 
 Despite Adam, you created a plan 
 To bring the holiest of kings through the lineage of man 
 The flood came just to judge wicked hearts 
 And there's a second flood and Jesus is the Ark 
 You can wait around and you can bore now 
 But when his rain comes down, the world will drown 
 You're perfect, you're just, you're love and you're great 
 You're holy, what a peace it is to know that God chose me 
 (Verse 3 - Sho Baraka) 
 The sun suspends in the air, I can feel your winds everywhere 
 You care till the grains of my hair 
 Divine works all around me, I can't get past the evidence 
 The fact that you're invisible to me is irrelevant 
 I know he's heaven sent straight to the virgin birth 
 Gave me a second chance even after man's curse 
 A third, a fourth, a fifth and a sixth 
 You wore my crown of thorns, you took my licks 
 As they spit in your face, off the cross a sinner you embraced 
 Now I understand what's the meaning of grace 
 I war against the flesh, can't wait till the day that you come 
 'Cause every day I'm rewriting Psalm 51 
 From the weak to the dumb, you make us shine like pearls 
 Got a new engagement, broke up with that girl named World 
 The relationship wasn't fruitful, we were Satan's pupils 
 He told us you was an unfair God, we believed those lies 
 We know the truth now, you've been fair since creation 
 Man fell and then you gave man emancipation 
 I know the saying "one sin can make man fall" 
 But with one drop of blood you can save us all 
 I'm a living sacrifice, I lay my life up on the altar 
 And pray to have faith to not forsake you as a martyr 
 I have a desire, that's to know you more 
 I have no choice to live holy, 'cause I see the Lord 
 (Hook - Quiana Fields) 
 He's holy, he's holy, he's holy, he's holy 
 He's holy, he's holy, he's holy, he's holy 
 I see the Lord, I see the Lord
