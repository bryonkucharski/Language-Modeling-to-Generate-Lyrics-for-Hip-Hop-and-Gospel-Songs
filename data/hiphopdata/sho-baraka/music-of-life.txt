 Okay ... 
 Let's go! 
 Oh ... 
 Oh ... 
 Oh ... 
 Oh ... 
 If you love this music of life, get your hands up 
 He's holy and perfect, so get your hands up 
 He's sovereign and majestic, so get your hands up 
 Get your hands up 
 Get your hands up 
 Before we couldn't sing that music of life 
 Now all we play is that music of Christ 
 Called and redeemed, get your hands up 
 Love God, love your brother He commands us 
 We live by a different beat, check the new sound 
 We walk in the spirit it's like a ghost town 
 We exalt a holy God who uses earth as a thrown 
 If His thrown is a chair then a chair is my home 
 My sound track of life went from blues into worship 
 It's a daily sacrifice, yeah ya' boy knows his purpose 
 Never saw a beautiful death until I saw the cross 
 Saw the nails hit my sins, hit the law, hit my flaws 
 How could the banging of nails make music of life 
 And the rolling of a stone echo power of Christ 
 It's not the kind of music that make the kids jump, but it is the kind of that makes heart thump. 
 Okay ... 
 Okay ... 
 Okay ... 
 Let's go! 
 Oh ... 
 Oh ... 
 Oh ... 
 Oh ... 
 If you love this music of life, get your hands up 
 He's holy and perfect, so get your hands up 
 He's sovereign and majestic, so get your hands up 
 Get your hands up 
 Get your hands up 
 It's the music that makes a stressed man cope, 
 Makes a suicidal cat want to drop that rope 
 Makes the hood drug dealer want to quit that dope 
 It's faith in Christ that brings man hope 
 Ever since the fall it ain't been much to sing about 
 We were born in life's grave but Christ has dug us out 
 So I shout I sing I keep His banner raised 
 116 on my heart, this boy is unashamed 
 Of the ancient of days a God who's unchanged 
 I carry my bed to show the world I was lame 
 I will not go back to which from I came 
 It's like a free man who wants to be a slave 
 I believe in His holiness, authority and might 
 Now that I'm sealed with the spirit a deposit of life 
 If you're free from the bondage get your hands up 
 Sick of low living, He turned our lives up 
 Okay ... 
 Okay ... 
 Okay ... 
 Let's go! 
 Oh ... 
 Oh ... 
 Oh ... 
 Oh ... 
 If you love this music of life, get your hands up 
 He's holy and perfect, so get your hands up 
 He's sovereign and majestic, so get your hands up 
 Get your hands up 
 Get your hands up 
 It's the music of life that makes kings bow down 
 Makes the lowly up rise, open the blind man's eyes 
 His eye is on the sparrow; I walk the straight and narrow 
 'Cause He is known to break the will of stubborn mules like Pharaoh 
 You can travel many cities, even nations over seas 
 Hearing stories of a Sheppard who gave His life for His sheep 
 And how he prepared a home after death for His peeps 
 Because He defeated death with a three day sleep 
 And now we write music to make the King blush 
 We got a crush on God, He choose not to crush us 
 But man's great tension is to steal God's fame 
 But He's had it since the sixth day ain't gon' change 
 The clouds are His high hats, the mountains are His keys 
 Thunder is the clap, you can hear the wind sing 
 If you find pleasure in the Lord, then get your hands up 
 He makes beautiful music I'm just a fan of... 
 Okay ... 
 Okay ... 
 Okay ... 
 Let's go! 
 Oh ... 
 Oh ... 
 Oh ... 
 Oh ... 
 If you love this music of life, get your hands up 
 He's holy and perfect, so get your hands up 
 He's sovereign and majestic, so get your hands up 
 Get your hands up 
 Get your hands up
