It's my life, ain't no way I can change at all even if I tried 
 That why I try, to go and tear the wall down let you all get a peak inside 
 But once you inside, I guarantee you won't like everything that you'll find 
 But what you'll find, is the grace of the LORD, 'cause His hands all over my life 
 It's my life 
 Nice aim, they taught us to aim for nothing 
 And look, we hit it dead on the button 
 The story of my life, if you flip through the chapters 
 Born in the maple leaf now I'm in Atlanta 
 Lived close to Hollywood, raised in the drama 
 God blessed my mama so she named me Baraka 
 Parents did the splits, so I split socially 
 I love moms but when pops left he took the most of me 
 I hated the mirror 'cause I struggled with my race 
 Everyday I would wish I was white, I'm such a disgrace 
 I had identity struggles that was no secret 
 I was lucky if my closest friends could speak English 
 So to fight that feeling I made the decision 
 I can hate my face or hate the opposition 
 I'm hanging with the militant, reading buffalo Soldiers 
 My friends in their room hanging Word up posters 
 This is my attempt to pull back the curtains 
 This is showing you the life of a young man hurting 
 2nd Chapter of my life, I see things different 
 Acting like Malcolm X got my boys tripping 
 I get silent treatments so I start to listening 
 The root of the issue I just want some significance 
 If that means thugging, I'll listen to pac 
 Smoke a little weed getting drunk on the Block 
 Doing petty crimes running from the Cops 
 Knowing pops would kill me if I ever got caught 
 My man got shot days later he's dead 
 Its running through my head we all allergic to lead 
 I'll never ever forget what my oldest brother said 
 You can be a dreamer but don't live in your bed 
 So I left that life and I went to college 
 My God became, money, sex, status and knowledge 
 And if I didn't get I'd go insane 
 I guess that's the result of a life with bad aim 
 They want a third chapter, sit back and listen 
 Like Matt Damon I was born for this mission 
 I heard a crazy message about the world's hero 
 And how it was a righteous kill, Robert Deniro 
 And how he got punished when he did zero 
 Just to bring a cure to some sin sick people 
 Did some research found none equal 
 Perfection wrapped in flesh to dead evil 
 I guess my biggest issues I thought I was a Christian 
 But now I have a passion for Christ Mel Gibson 
 I asked my man if he knew his way to heaven 
 He said sure they open doors around seven 
 And closes at 3 so go get your blessings 
 I guess it's my fault for assuming his understanding 
 He knows what he needs he's scared to explore why 
 Eternity's on his heart Christ hit the bullseye
