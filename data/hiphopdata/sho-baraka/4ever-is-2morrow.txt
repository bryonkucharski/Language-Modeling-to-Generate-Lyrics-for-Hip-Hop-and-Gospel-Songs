My heart has caused me so many losses I never really thought it through 
 We live a lie think we never die, but tomorrow catches up with you 
 Forever, we shouldn't waste our time together 
 So many people want forever 
 We would do dirt just because of peer pressure 
 Two knuckle heads and we ran the streets together 
 Just to impress the homies we would do whatever 
 Now you're locked up and it feels like (forever) 
 Some reason I feel like it's my fault 
 You found out I found faith, I found out you got caught 
 You serving time, I'm serving with time 
 You guilty of crime, I'm guilty of crime, against the divine 
 We thought we would forever do dirt 
 The un-quenching of man's thirst, forever is man's curse 
 Now we see the consequences and they hurt 
 An easy way to ruin lives when you put self-first 
 There is always freedom behind bars 
 We roam freely but we don't recognize ours 
 Forever is tomorrow 
 There is hope for your worries and rest of your sorrows 
 Yeah Lady you are mine 
 It's you and I until the end of time, (That's a mac line) 
 This covenant don't mean much to most 
 They get a little spooked then their ghost, (what a joke) 
 Hey this is more than a rhyme; I've been called to provide 
 Even if I'm the last of my kind (clever) 
 Yes I know there's more; we're on one accord 
 We will please the Lord, (whom we stand before) 
 It's more than opening Doors, real service is more 
 This is even through rich and through poor 
 Some don't think about the vows their taking 
 Oath before God and the promise their making 
 These other jokers they don't see a queen 
 I guess it's hard when they don't see a King, (know what I mean) 
 This can't be Hollywood romance 
 If that's an indication of love, then we won't last 
 That's a system that's built against us 
 They sale lust and they're just here to tempt us 
 I am physic I can predict the weather 
 The storms may come but the sun shines forever 
 What's this all about forever is Tomorrow 
 Well life is short and our time is borrowed 
 And the lender wants his payment 
 And its impossible for us to make arrangements, (were so endangered) 
 Let me introduce you to a stranger 
 Who can pay your debt and turn God's anger (born in a manger) 
 He's the path to forever, He's the standard and measure 
 He brings God and man together, (clever) 
 When man wants his own way, and evil is ok, 
 When he knows he should go right and goes left 
 Somebody's gotta pay for those who disobey 
 Sacrifice was the only way, He took death 
 I'm talking about Christ the Son, the righteous one 
 The only way tomorrow will come 
 I'm speaking of life eternal, life that's borrowed 
 He's more than a good man with morals 
 He's the reason we move and breath 
 You know peace when you know the king, (God intervened) 
 I know you're thinking these Christians do to much 
 We can't do enough in lieu of what he's done for us
