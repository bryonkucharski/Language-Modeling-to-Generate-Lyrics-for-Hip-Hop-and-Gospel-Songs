 And I don't wanna play by the book, no rules

 Ain't you s'posed to eat it too? 
 Ain't that what you s'posed to do? 
 Ain't I s'posed to eat it too?

 Lay your body down all over my plate 
 Once I blow the candles out, put it in my face 
 So tell me you gon' serve it up nice 
 The customer's always right, baby
