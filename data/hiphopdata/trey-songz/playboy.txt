Don't know why I'm still 
 Still kissing girls that I don't love 
 Still stumbling out of these clubs 
 Still, I'm just so hard to trust 
 Don't know why I'm still a playboy (still) 
 Still running 'round tryin' to lay up 
 Still fucking but I wanna make love, I really want to 
 Don't know why I'm still a playboy 
 Too many nights to remember 
 So many girls, I can't count 
 Can't keep track of these adventures 
 What has become of me now? 
 I thought each one was special 
 Oh, who am I kidding? 
 Why do the things feel so good? 
 That I so forbidden, okay 
 That's enough of child's play 
 I think it's time to settle down 
 But the game won't let me out 
 Don't know why I'm still 
 Still kissing girls that I don't love 
 Still stumbling out of these clubs 
 Still, I'm just so hard to trust 
 Don't know why I'm still a playboy (still) 
 Still running 'round tryin' to lay up 
 Still fucking but I wanna make love, I really want to 
 Don't know why I'm still a playboy 
 I'm feeling all kinds of pressure 
 My momma wants another grandchild 
 Can't say I'm not making the effort 
 But these women keep calling me out 
 I guess I'm losing this battle 
 Oh, I'd be trippin' 
 Why do things that feel so good? 
 Put me in this position, okay 
 That's enough of child's play 
 I think it's time to settle down (settle down) 
 But the game won't let me out 
 Don't know why I'm still (I'm still) 
 Still kissing girls that I don't love 
 Still stumbling out of these clubs 
 Still, I'm just so hard to trust 
 Don't know why I'm still a playboy (still) 
 Still running 'round tryin' to lay up (lay up) 
 Still fucking but I wanna make love, I really want to 
 Don't know why I'm still a playboy 
 Hoes down way too many times in the deal 
 Gave me away too many times, I done seen it 
 I just hope that I ain't too late 
 I just hope that I ain't seal my fate 
 Oh baby, can I, can I pick it up? 
 Can I get back the love? 
 I really want to change my life 
 Girl, there's nothing that I want more now 
 But the game won't let me out 
 Don't know why I'm still 
 Still kissing girls that I don't love 
 Still stumbling out of these clubs 
 Still, I'm just so hard to trust 
 Don't know why I'm still a playboy (still) 
 Still running 'round tryin' to lay up (lay up) 
 Still fucking but I wanna make love, I really want to
