(Verse One) 
 It's so unsual to me 
 How I can see 
 That thang you got 
 From the the back 
 To the front 
 It's so beautilful to me 
 Girl you see 
 This dream I got 
 You'd be walking all through it 
 The way you do it 
 Shawty I want you so so bad 
 You running through my mind 
 All I see ur behind yeah 
 Shawty I want you so so bad 
 You running through my mind 
 All I see ur behind yeah 
 (Verse Two) 
 And all I see 
 Is you on top of me 
 Watching you ride 
 Looking to my eyes 
 All I need is to be inside 
 I'll be sliding in the front 
 Going to the behind 
 Shawty I want you so so bad 
 You running through my mind 
 All I see ur behind yeah 
 Shawty I want you so so bad 
 You running through my mind 
 All I see ur behind yeah 
 (Verse Three - Birdman) 
 Aye that girl so big 
 Aye that girl so phat 
 Aye the girl so big 
 Aye that girl so phat 
 Why is your back bone bigger that the usual 
 Little mama why you so phat 
 How long did it take that thang to grow 
 I'd love to hit that front the back 
 Me and my cut cuts 
 You and your gut guts 
 Rub on your butt butt 
 Diggin' your gut guts 
 And you already-dy 
 Put some pounds on the d d

 You running through my mind 
 All I see ur behind yeah

 You running through my mind
