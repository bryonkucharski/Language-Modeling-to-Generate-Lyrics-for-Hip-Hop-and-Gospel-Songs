(C'mon) I like a long hair redbone thick, with them legs long (YUP), 
 Shawty head strong, blow me till her head gone 
 Shawty scream loud, shawty gone moan 
 Call that music to my ears, headphone 
 After we get it in, you can head home 
 Then I'm a get your friend, in my bedroom, 
 I often fantasize I could get all you in a ride, 
 Get so much pussy I bet you I can guess yo panty size, 
 August 4th, is you ready for me girl, 
 I fuck you better than dem niggas in your world, 
 Lick that kitty cat until she purrs meow, 
 Beat it up so bad you wanna curse me out, 
 If you top modeling, if ya twitter following 
 If you in a whip, who give a shit what kinda car you in 
 Every girl I just want your bodies, let me borrow them 
 Treat 'em like they need it, I'll massage, touch and fondle them 
 Paint your body naked on my wall and when you modeling 
 You bust it wide open like you always had it bottled in 
 Drizzy told G to throw his feet up on the ottoman 
 I'm starving, so I'm eating all the singers I go harder then 
 Pause, then I start again 
 Fall coming hard again 
 I just killed the summer and the shit ain't really started yet 
 All of my regards are in 
 I kill and send a card to them 
 Fuck what niggas think I hit the bank and start depositing 
 I tried to told them I'm a problem 
 You should bend ha over not the under 
 Tho the odds have been in favor of these ugh niggas 
 You know they love trigga 
 Finger fuckin' make 'em bust 
 Get it, they love trigga 
 You can catch me with the finest 
 Some age like my wine is or short like my time is 
 Let me tell you what a dime is 
 She make me, wanna tear it apart and eat it up like she was prime ribs 
 She knows just how to grind it 
 Make them boys lose it and I know just how to find it 
 Cupid said I'm stupid 'cause I show you where my mind is 
 Heads up, shawty lift your legs up 
 Oh, Oh I'm nasty, I'm nasty 
 Don't you be appalled shawty I got what your ass need? 
 Just kiddin I ain't tryna be inconsiderate 
 But next time you bring your girls with you, consider this
