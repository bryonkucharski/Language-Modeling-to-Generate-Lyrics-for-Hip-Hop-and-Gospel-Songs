 I ain't feeling my best (no) 
 All they want is my sex 
 I got the best out 
 (I got the best) 
 I'll do some things you won't believe 
 So many weaves, I didn't sweat out 
 Think I might've found love one time 
 Think I might've found love few times 
 Yeah, probably (ooh probably) 
 Think I had a good girl one time 
 Think I had a good girl few times 
 I'm sorry 
 Why oh, why am I in my bed I lie 
 All in my bed alone, my eyes open wide 
 I wonder which one of y'all finna come up 
 Do it sun down till the sun up 
 And she won't tell me no 
 Yes, she gon' come running 
 I keep girls on hold, I'm not being funny 
 But tonight I'm on a different time 
 Want something I've been trying to find 
 Maybe something I done left behind 
 Baby, fronting but it once was mine 
 All the times you were disappointed 
 All the girls 'cause I'm always lonely 
 I'ma miss you, yeah, that's what she told me 
 Now I'm wishing she would pull up on me

 Pull up on me, now I'm wishing she would pull up on me
