When the days are done 
 When you and I would take the world on 
 Yeah, to the place where no one knows of 
 Now I can't stop thinking about you 
 I'm a ghost looking for you 
 It hurts but it's true 
 That I will never ever see you again 
 And I'll never ever hold you again 
 In my arms, never ever again, 
 And I will never ever feel you again 
 But I will always love you the same 
 My girl never ever again 
 I wish we had a little more luck in love 
 Now you are long gone 
 But I still got your birthday card 
 Yeah, put a stamp on her address 
 Oh now I can't stop dreaming 'bout you 
 I'm a lost star without you 
 It hurts but it's true 
 That I will never ever see you again 
 And I'll never ever hold you again 
 In my arms, never ever again, 
 And I will never ever feel you again 
 But I will always love you the same 
 My girl never ever again 
 I wish we had a little more luck in love 
 Suddenly it takes me all along 
 To the point where it breaks my heart 
 Such a major love, never gonna touch again 
 I will never ever see you again 
 And I'll never ever hold you again 
 In my arms, never ever again, 
 I wish we had a little more to look in love 
 Never ever again 
 Never ever again 
 Never again
