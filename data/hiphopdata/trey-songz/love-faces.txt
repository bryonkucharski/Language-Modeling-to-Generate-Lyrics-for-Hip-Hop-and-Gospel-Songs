When I met you woman 
 I couldn't help but notice a face so beautiful 
 Now imagine, the faces you'd make if we ever made love 
 (Oh, oh, oh, oh) 
 Pulled up in the drop top Benz 
 Hit the horn two times and you walked outside (mmmhmm) 
 Dress keep hugging them thighs 
 And the only thing inside my mind is (mmmhmmm) 
 I want you 
 Yes I do, and if there's anything you suggest I do 
 Then tell me 
 Now we all in the crib on my sofa 
 Girl I'm so glad you came over 
 I wanna tell you 'come closer' 
 But I don't know if you feel, like I feel 
 Tell me girl 
 Don't it feel good when I touch on it 
 Wouldn't it be nice if all night I was in you 
 Come kiss me, come with me 
 Down the hall to my bedroom 
 Tonight we'll be 
 Making love faces, making love faces 
 Shadows on the wall while the candles burnin' 
 Messin' up the bed while you sweatin' out your perm and 
 Making love faces, making love faces 
 My hands rubbin' on your skin 
 Let's go hard don't hold it in 
 Girl let me wrap my hands around you 
 So happy every since I found you 
 Just like a kid who found some candy 
 Let me feel and find your panties 
 Take 'em off take 'em off 
 Take 'em off please 
 Oh down on my knees 
 You're right in front of me 
 Don't have to pay for my attention 
 Can you hear me is you listenin? 
 Tell me girl 
 Don't it feel good when I touch on it 
 Wouldn't it be nice if all night I was in you 
 Come kiss me, come with me 
 Down the hall to my bedroom 
 Tonight we'll be 
 Making love faces, making love faces 
 Shadows on the wall while the candles burnin' 
 Messin' up the bed while you sweatin' out your perm and 
 Making love faces, making love faces 
 My hands rubbin' on your skin 
 Let's go hard don't hold it in 
 The way you bite your lip 
 Is that your way of tellin' me you like it? 
 Mmhmm, if I'm the best you ever had girl in your life 
 Say mmhmm, and when your eyes roll back in your head 
 Shakin' your legs 
 Mmhmm, mmhmm, that's what she said 
 Making love faces, making love faces 
 Shadows on the wall while the candles burnin' 
 Messin' up the bed while you sweatin' out your perm and 
 Making love faces, making love faces 
 My hands rubbin' on your skin 
 Let's go hard don't hold it in, love faces
