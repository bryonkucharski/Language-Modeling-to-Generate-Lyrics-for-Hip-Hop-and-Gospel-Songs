What's happenin' homie dis the one Plies man hey pain tell 'em 
 Bout your shawty and I tell them bout mine 
 Even though I'm not your man, you not my girl 
 I'ma call you my shawty 
 'Cause I can't stand to see you treated bad 
 I beat his ass for my shawty 
 And we ain't did nothin' that we ain't supposed to do 
 'Cause you my shawty 
 Baby girl you know I be home, keep me on the ring tone shawty 
 Sing it to me girl 
 Soon as I seen her, shit told her I'd pay for it 
 Lil mama the baddest thing 'round here and she already know it 
 I pointed at the donk and told her this supposed to be yours 
 Showed her a couple stacks and told her I'd let her blow it 
 The hottest nigga in the city baby you can't ignore it 
 I showed her I was a real nigga and she went for it 
 First time I [called ?] her shit, she ain't even know how to throw it back 
 Now she an animal, I got her sex game right 
 I taught her how to talk to me while she take pipe 
 And opened her up and showed her what a real nigga like 
 I told her I don't usually do this, I don't fuck on the first night 
 'Cause after I beat ya baby I'm liable to fuck up ya whole life 
 I gotta train her, now she suck me with ice 
 I call her my lil bustie baby 'cause she keep it tight 
 Whenever I tell her to bust, ain't gotta tell her twice 
 Whenever I wanna get off she know how to get me right 
 Whoa w-w-whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa 
 Whoa w-w-whoa shawty 
 Whoa w-w-whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa 
 Whoa w-w-whoa shawty 
 I love to show her off, cause all the dope boys want her 
 Know why they wanna beat [badly ?], look at all that ass on her 
 Look how that pussy sit up in them shorts, you gotta want her 
 Love when she act like she bo-legged and bend the [corner ?] 
 She proud to be fuckin' me, 'cause I'm stuntin on 'em 
 It feel good to be fuckin' a real nigga don't'uh 
 Ain't called her in two days, gotta let her mind wonder 
 But when she miss me, she call to tell me to jump on her 
 That's why I don't mind breakin her off, 'cause she ain't with the drama 
 If you done ripped her before, you know how to cuff lil mama 
 You know she gotta be somethin', 'cause I done beat [her under ?] 
 [?] Snatchin [?], I'm tellin' ya, I promise 
 I exposed her to real, and now she hate lame 
 Member she used to run from me, now she like pain 
 She call me sometimes just to ask is it her thing 
 Ever since I ran up in shawty she ain't been the same 
 Whoa w-w-whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa 
 Whoa w-w-whoa shawty 
 Whoa w-w-whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa 
 Whoa w-w-whoa shawty
