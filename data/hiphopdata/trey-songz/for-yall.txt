I put my mind and my time all up in this shit 
 I sacrifice the whole life I'm not witnessing 
 They ask me why I do it... 
 I tell'em that I do it tell'em that I do it for y'all 
 ...For y'all for y'all... 
 If life is a game I guess everybody watching my... 
 Swell days when its well played... Dwayne wade I guess kev is my L.J 
 Soaring super high when the L blase... 
 But as the jay fades way I'm victim to expectance 
 Never knowing what they will expect of me or what they gone suggest I be... 
 I probably fall short media of all sorts 
 Break a nigga balls then they piss a nigga off 
 Going through liquor withdraws tell the women in my life I couldn't catch 'em if they fall 
 Cause attention is expensive and the cost will leave your heart broke 
 Heavy is the pressure she just want to take it off though... 
 I'm I know winning but its still a steady lost think back to those days when it was just me and my dogs a Petersburg nigga with dreams of being a boss... and being me wasn't difficult at all... 
 I put my mind and my time all up in this shit 
 I sacrifice the whole life I'm not witnessing 
 They ask me why I do it... 
 I tell'em that I do it tell'em that I do it for y'all 
 ...For y'all for y'all... 
 If home is where the heart is 
 Tell me why I'm losing my mind inside of this suite that bigger than your apartment 
 Victim of circumstances sometimes standing in the sunshine camera flashing dumb times 
 Made now I'm famous now everybody know my name 
 But where goes old Tremaine seems as if he's fading now 
 Why do we get famous just to wish to turn the famous down 
 Normal seas in life are something very far away and close to vacant 
 Now but the currency I'm making now brick flips can get a whole shipment then picth 'em in 
 The dealers in your town break it down sell it out 
 And the numbers are a slumber compared to what's in my bank account 
 I put your bread to bed go head rest boo why you think I said I wanna be successful 
 'Cause I did and I'm is and I want that... 
 But still the life I had before this I want back... 
 I put my mind and my time all up in this shit 
 I sacrifice the whole life I'm not witnessing 
 They ask me why I do it... 
 I tell'em that I do it tell'em that I do it for y'all 
 ...For y'all for y'all... 
 Now that my dreams have become my reality 
 I surely see that everything that glitters ain't gold 
 I'm only human and we breath the same air heavy as the load I bare 
 My family and fans just understand that a nigga really do for y'all 
 That's why a nigga do it I said that's why a nigga do it ugh 
 Don't you know I do it (I do it) said don't you know I do it (I do it) 
 Don't you know I [x2] 
 Don't you know I do it 
 I put my mind and my time all up in this shit 
 I sacrifice the whole life I'm not witnessing 
 They ask me why I do it 
 I tell'em that I do it I tell'em that I do it for y'all 
 For y'all [x5]
