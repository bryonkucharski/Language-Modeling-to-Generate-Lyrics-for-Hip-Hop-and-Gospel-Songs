She said that she didn't wanna be loved 
 I said, "Why the hell are you here?" 
 She said tonight she don't wanna be touched 
 And if that's the truth, why you so near? 
 Oh no 
 She kissing on me, she tugging on me 
 Oh, she want it 
 This girl is bad, bad, bad 
 She lovin' it 
 I know she say that she don't but she do 
 She lovin' it 
 She let go and her body get loose 
 She lovin' it 
 Oh, you should see the way that she moves 
 She lovin' it 
 She lovin' it 
 She said she love it when I get her off 
 She said that she don't wanna be fucked 
 I said, "Why the hell are you sleeping naked?" 
 She told me she ain't ready, oh no 
 But that shy girl, she kinda overrated, uh, ooh na na 
 She kissing on me, she tugging on me 
 Oh, she want it

 She said she love it when I get her off 
 And even though she said she don't

 And even though those beautiful lips are telling me lies
