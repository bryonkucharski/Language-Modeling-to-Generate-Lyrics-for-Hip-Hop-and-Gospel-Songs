I can't really explain what it is she does 
 But um, whatever it is 
 It's um, simply, simply amazing 
 Her head is on my chest, sun comes rolling in 
 We're lost in these covers, and all I feel is skin 
 I slowly kiss your face, beautiful in every way, you are (you are) 
 See I'm a man that don't believe in much 
 But I'll be damned, if I don't believe in us 
 And how we play a fight up in the bathroom 
 Next thing I know I'm making love to you 
 Girl, promise me you'll never change 
 She ain't perfect, but she's worth it 
 Every breath I breathe, for the life of me 
 And I know I might not deserve it 
 But she loves me, and it's simply amazing (you are), 
 Simply amazing (you are), simply amazing (you are) 
 And she loves me, and it's simply amazing, amaze-amazing 
 The girl's a work of art, and I can't help but stare 
 With a smile like the sunset, and the ocean is her hair 
 Ooh what she do ain't fair ooh 
 She know me better, than I know myself, mhmmm 
 See I'm a man, that don't believe in much 
 But I'll be damned if I don't believe in us 
 Like when I said I loved you for the first time 
 And the tears dropped from your eyes 
 Girl, don't you ever change 
 'Cause she ain't perfect, but she's worth it 
 Every breath I breathe for the life of me 
 And I know I might not deserve it 
 But she loves me, and it's simply amazing (you are) 
 Simply amazing (you are), simply amazing (you are) 
 And she loves me 
 There is nothing, in this world 
 That can keep me away from you 
 And there's nobody who could ever compare to you 
 Ooh 
 She ain't perfect (no she ain't), but she's worth it (she is) 
 Every breath I breathe, for the life of me 
 And I know I might not deserve it 
 But she loves me and it's simply amazing (you are) 
 Simply amazing (you are), simply amazing (you are) 
 And she loves me, and it's simply amazing
