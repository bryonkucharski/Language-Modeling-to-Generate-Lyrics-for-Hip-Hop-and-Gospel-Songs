Baby I'mma be straight up 
 Don't waste no time 
 I know you ain't my, you ain't my baby 
 Do you think about us 
 Do I cross your mind anytime 
 I know that you, you're taken 
 It'll never change 
 'Cause it's always been that way 
 But you know that you 
 Can't fake it 
 He can't give you what I got here right now 
 Girl I know what you want 
 No phones, we ain't even gotta talk 
 Next time that he leave you all alone 
 I'm gon' come through, replace him 
 I'm gonna watch you 
 Get naked 
 I'm gonna tell you 
 Girl take it 
 Next time that he leave you all alone 
 I'll give you all the love he denied 
 I'm about to take his spot 
 Let your man know that 
 Mr. Steal Your Girl is back 
 So let your man know that 
 Mr. Steal Your Girl is back, back 
 Baby let me tell you what's up 
 I don't trust that n****, f*** that n**** 
 Stop bringing him up 
 Baby, I ain't never gave no f***s 
 One f***'s too much, unless you're talking about us 
 I know that you, you're taken 
 It'll never change 
 'Cause it's always been that way 
 But you know that you 
 Can't fake it 
 He can't give you what I got here right now 
 Girl I know what you want 
 No phones, we ain't even gotta talk 
 Next time that he leave you all alone 
 I'm gon' come through, replace him 
 I'm gonna watch you 
 Get naked 
 I'm gonna tell you 
 Girl take it 
 Next time that he leave you all alone 
 I'll give you all the love he denied 
 I'm about to take his spot 
 Let your man know that
