 (Scarface)

 Tck! I'm a call you back 
 Girl you know... (Awww!) 
 Girl you know I-iii-iiiih 
 Girl you know I-iii-iiiih love you (Awww baby!) 
 Trey Songz: 
 You can't be my girlfriend... 
 Can you see that your just caught in my whirlwind 
 (Scarface Verse 1) 
 I think if Adam would of had another squeeze he might 
 Not have ate those fruits from the leaves of light 
 Far as Eve, we could have been the more deceiving wife 
 Seeing the nigga had a weak spot and she was right 
 I just call it how I see it, she in love with him 
 And he in love too, and still be fucking all of them 
 Can you imagine you in lock with one breeze for life? 
 Waking up in the morning and laying down the night 
 With the same face looking at you all the time 
 Realizing now that happiness was hard to find 
 You wanna go out and try to find that smile and face 
 Plus she's always mad, and her sex ain't great 
 And she don't suck dick like she used to do 
 Force a nigga into trying to find him something new 
 And on the real, I done seen it when it went like this 
 But girl there's one thing happening that you can't forget 
 (Scarface Verse 2) 
 But you can never be my main boo, we can remain cool 
 But we can't be seen and for this I can blame you 
 Because you got more miles than a F-350 
 You been ran through, and I know for a fact you got history 
 But since we met, I've been hearing your name in certain circles 
 Pussy got a snap like a turtle 
 And you can catch a nigga on the late night 
 Coming out the club, half drunk off Remy and Sprite 
 You make a man out of your clit, that's how you handle the dick 
 It's unlike no other, she a bad motherfucker 
 But I'm too strong to let a hoe undercover 
 Make me look fucked up, because unlike those others 
 I done met a lot of freaky girls in my lifespan 
 So you can't get mad because I am not your man 
 Your under-standing was bad, it was not my plan 
 For you to fall in love with me, girl it's not like that 
 (Scarface Verse 3) 
 For me to say that, "I do, " would be a lie because I don't 
 Believe no woman is right for me so I won't 
 Try to talk myself into thinking she is 
 And if she leaves me for this, that's just one less bitch 
 And trust me, I tried to be a one woman man 
 But for every one woman, there's a man, home man 
 Saying, "Damn, I done spent six years in this shit 
 The first two was cool and then the bitch just flipped" 
 And then that's it, had to make some new plans 
 'Cause your brand new woman got a brand new man 
 And you're hurt all along, steady hitting her phone 
 But a bigger dick and longer bank roll, she gone 
 And if I ever say, "Maybe, " and you thought that I might 
 You consider, just imagine what my wife was like 
 And if you ain't love my kids like you loved your own 
 And me unconditionally when I was wrong, I was gone
