Got me tied down on the way to the beach 
 Four bad chicks in the middle of the street 
 Roll right up and they all hopped in 
 Now we in the sand having lunch on me 
 Tell the girl don't let your feet get wet 
 We about to grab some drinks and head to my condo 
 You can be my weekend guest 
 I'm in her head so I know we're bout to get started 
 One thing led to the next, now she got her hands all over my body 
 I ain't trying to stop and I know she with it 
 I can see it in her eyes she been down from the beginning 
 And she can't leave me alone 'cause I drive her body crazy 
 I done gave her a little taste now she wanna have my babies 
 Chilling in Miami and I met a little freak 
 Got three bad friends and they all on me 
 And me and baby girl been chilling all week 
 And all we do is fuck, drink, and sleep 
 Yes, all we do is fuck, drink, and sleep 
 All we do is fuck, drink, and sleep 
 Chilling in Miami and I met a little freak 
 And all we do is fuck, drink, and sleep 
 Now we on the balcony chilling 
 She loving the view and we smoke 
 I'm loving it too while I stroke 
 Got the stars looking down on us 
 Do it till the sunrise up 
 Beat, beat, beat, take a drink, go to sleep 
 She a freak, she can get it right up, get it right up 
 Man shorty like to energize up 
 She just wanna ride, she ain't never tired 
 She cooking naked, eggs and some bacon 
 After I eat that I treat that then eat that again, and again, and again 
 I ain't trying to stop and I know she with it 
 I can see it in her eyes she been down from the beginning 
 And she can't leave me alone 'cause I drive her body crazy 
 I don gave her a little taste now she wanna have my babies
