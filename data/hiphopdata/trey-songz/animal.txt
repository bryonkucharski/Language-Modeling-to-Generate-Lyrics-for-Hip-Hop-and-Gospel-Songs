I like it 
 I ain't gonna lie but baby, you get pretty wild, girl 
 When you take it off, take it off 
 When days turn to night, that's when you show your other side 
 With all those freaky thoughts, freaky thoughts 
 You bring out the animal 
 Girl, you know I'm on my way now 
 Girl, you know I'm on my way, my way to you 
 I'ma bring my anaconda 
 Gonna get to, get to your forbidden fruit 
 Turn the bed into a jungle 
 I'm Tarzan, you be my Jane up in this room 
 Girl, you know I'm finna hunt ya, yeah 
 You the one I'm preyin' on 
 I'm a boss, I'm a boss, I'm the leader of the pack 
 Boomerang, boomerang, baby, gon' and throw it back 
 Do your thang, do your thang, girl, you dunno how to act 
 I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'ma eat that pussy cat 
 I ain't gonna lie but baby, you get pretty wild, girl 
 When you take it off, take it off 
 When days turn to night, that's when you show your other side 
 With all those freaky thoughts, freaky thoughts 
 You bring out the animal 
 Animal, uh huh, yeah 
 Animal 
 This that ghetto Kama Sutra 
 Twist and bend and bend and twistin' all around 
 Treat you like you're in danger 
 And this the last time that I can take you down 
 That National Geographic (uh huh) 
 Document it and record it on a film 
 Anybody got a camera? Uh 
 Oh, you wanna experiment 
 I'm a boss, I'm a boss, I'm the leader of the pack 
 Boomerang, boomerang, baby, gon' and throw it back 
 Do your thing, do your thing, girl, you dunno how to act 
 I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'ma eat that pussy cat, ay 
 I ain't gonna lie but baby, you get pretty wild, girl 
 When you take it off, take it off 
 When days turn to night, that's when you show your other side 
 With all those freaky thoughts, freaky thoughts 
 You bring out the animal, whoa, yeah 
 Whoa, animal, whoa 
 You bring out the animal 
 I go ape up on the donkey (throw that ass) 
 I be throwin' this banana all around (sheesh) 
 Put my face up in the monkey (my mask) 
 No umbrella but the rain is pourin' down 
 Kill the kitty, no lion 
 Big mon, I'm a well up in your sea (for real) 
 Got your body flyin', oh 
 No you feelin' like a dove, give me love 
 I'm a boss, I'm a boss, I'm the leader of the pack 
 Boomerang, boomerang, baby, gon' and throw it back 
 Do your thing, do your thing, girl, you dunno how to act 
 I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'ma eat that pussy cat (go) 
 I ain't gonna lie but baby, you get pretty wild, girl 
 When you take it off, take it off 
 When days turn to night, that's when you show your other side 
 With all those freaky thoughts, yeah, freaky thoughts 
 You bring out the animal, whoa 
 Animal, whoa
