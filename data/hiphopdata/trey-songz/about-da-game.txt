It ain't about the rims on ma truck 
 Ain't about the ice on ma watch 
 Ain't about the coup on ma truck 
 Baby, it's about the game 
 Ride and low 
 (Ride and low) 
 Lay back in the seats and creep 
 That's just how I roll 
 With some fresh nice ones on ma feet 
 This is how we go 
 (This is how we go) 
 And I'm tryin' to find a chick who ain't about the duo 
 'Cause it ain't about that no more 
 It ain't about the rims on ma truck 
 Ain't about the ice on ma watch 
 Ain't about the coup on ma truck 
 Baby, it's about the game 
 It ain't about the shows that I f*** 
 Ain't about the duo or ma rocks 
 And am lyf that I live it don't stop 
 Baby, it's about the game 
 Look at me 
 (Look at me) 
 When you ask why I sit in the streets, that's who I be 
 Yo, I live for the duo for feelin' free 
 They are too many other dudes 
 You can choose that got this luxury 
 But without it all 
 (All the haters want to hate me) 
 But just nothin' 
 (But the ladies just want to luv me) 
 And they luv me for what I do 
 It ain't about the rims on ma truck 
 Ain't about the ice on ma watch 
 Ain't about the coup on ma truck 
 Baby, it's about the game 
 It ain't about the shows that I f*** 
 Ain't about the duo or ma rocks 
 And am lyf that I live it don't stop 
 Baby, it's about the game 
 Ride and low 
 (Ride and low) 
 Lay back in the seats and creep 
 That's just how I roll 
 With some fresh nice ones on ma feet 
 This is how we go 
 (This is how we go) 
 And I'm tryin' to find a chick who ain't about the duo 
 'Cause it ain't about that no more 
 It ain't about the rims on ma truck 
 Ain't about the ice on ma watch 
 Ain't about the coup on ma truck 
 Baby, it's about the game 
 It ain't about the shows that I f*** 
 Ain't about the duo or ma rocks 
 And am lyf that I live it don't stop 
 Baby, it's about the game
