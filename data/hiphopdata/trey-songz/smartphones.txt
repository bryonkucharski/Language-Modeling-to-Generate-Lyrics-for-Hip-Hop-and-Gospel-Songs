She picks up the phone 
 In my head I know I'm wrong 
 I just want to know what she's heard 
 I'm pacing back and forth 
 'Cause I know that I've been caught 
 Trying to think of the perfect words 
 So I can come to her and lie right to her face 
 I don't know what I'm gonna say 
 But I know that I'm gonna say 
 Whatever it takes 
 I'mma run to her and lie right to her face 
 I don't know what I'm gonna say 
 But I know that I'm gonna say 
 Whatever it takes 
 Time is not on our side 
 'Cause she's waving goodbye goodbye 
 'Cause she's waving goodbye goodbye 
 Smarts phones, dumb shit 
 She never knew I call so if she heard it all 
 I'm all out of luck tonight 
 I can say it was a joke but who am I kidding she ain't slow 
 Only way to make it right 
 Is if I come to her and lie right to her face 
 I don't know what I'm gonna say 
 But I know that I'm gonna say 
 Whatever it takes 
 I'mma run to her and lie right to her face 
 I don't know what I'm gonna say 
 But I know that I'm gonna say 
 Whatever it takes 
 Man I got to think of something 
 I'm about to lose it all 
 I swear that shit really didn't mean nothing 
 It all started with a pocket call 
 So I'mma run to her and lie right to her face 
 I don't know what I'm gonna say 
 But I know that I'm gonna say 
 Whatever it takes 
 I'mma run to her and lie right to her face 
 I don't know what I'm gonna say 
 But I know that I'm gonna say 
 Whatever it takes 
 Time is not on our side 
 'Cause she's waving goodbye goodbye 
 'Cause she's waving goodbye goodbye 
 Smarts phones, dumb shit
