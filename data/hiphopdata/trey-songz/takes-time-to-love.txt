A material girl in her own world can't even see the things she's missing 
 Right in the curve, a little girl wanting to grow up and be a star 
 Take a look around without looking down 
 All these things have blurred your vision 
 Material things don't amount to nothing 
 But I know how you feel 
 It's hard to see who's real 
 It takes time living in a world 
 When you don't know who to trust 
 Next time slow it down 
 And don't feel you don't have to rush 
 It'll be fine, it takes time, takes time to love 
 Know I'ma tell the truth when it comes to you my lady 
 And it's miracle you have found a conscience baby 
 I hadn't planned on leaving you can't even give a reason 
 Now I know the reason why, why 
 But I know how you feel 
 It's hard to see who's real 
 It takes time living in a world 
 When you don't know who to trust 
 Next time slow it down 
 And don't feel you don't have to rush 
 It'll be fine, it takes time, takes time to love 
 No, love ain't in the money, love ain't in the cars 
 Love ain't in the jewellery, love ain't in the Mars 
 Perfect place to start searchin' is your heart 
 Just have patience 
 It takes time living in a world 
 When you don't know who to trust 
 Next time slow it down 
 And don't feel you don't have to rush 
 It'll be fine, it takes time, takes time to love 
 It takes time to love 
 It takes time to love 
 It takes time to love
