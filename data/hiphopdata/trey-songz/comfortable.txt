Trey Songz/Comfortable 
 It's just entertainment 
 I'm not saying this to blame you I'm saying 
 I'm not saying this to play you I'm saying 
 It's all good when we making love 
 All I ask is don't take our love for granted 
 It's granted My love for you is real 
 If you don't love me somebody else will 
 Baby girl don't you eva oh no get to get to comfortable 
 Now ain't the bed comfy when you sleep 
 Don't your ass stay here for the free 
 It's the year of the g tho you know how I be tho 
 Kick your ass out them and then I'm fly like a free throw 
 Call me crazy like c lo 
 4 5 6 chicks waiting like c lo 
 Listening to them hoes 
 Get the boot like timbo 
 Be missing the green 
 Like a fein for the indo 
 Don't act all low like limbo 
 My pie your slice like kimbo 
 Leave me and you dumb 
 Then slow 
 Gimme back my shit like a rental 
 Get out my face like a hair that's ingrown 
 Lotta brains never took you for a bimbo 
 A lotta lames you was rolling with a pimp tho 
 And I let you ride like I ride instrumentals 
 So you was saying you gonna leave me 
 Well take your time be easy 
 Cause girl you could never play me 
 Even if you listening to a trey day CD 
 Before I eject your disc 
 Let me know you this 
 I'm a family guy truly 
 But I could give a fuck about the dog or stewy 
 I'm not saying this to make you upset 
 I'm not saying this to play you I'm saying 
 It's all good wanna break it off 
 All I ask when I'm taking off 
 That you handle it 
 Can you handle it 
 I don't need you for real 
 I know I loved you 
 But somebody else will 
 Baby girl Cause you must've got to comfortable 
 You know I got a lot a love for ya 
 Like I'm on drugs for you 
 So addicted but I know I can kick this 
 That's why I'm talking big shit 
 The way you lick them lips and ya hips would say 
 Nigga I know you gone miss this 
 But baby I wonder 
 How you gonna sleep without ya sleep number 69 
 Freaky time 
 You get it on the normal you and I were porno live 
 We got it in all night 
 And I tell you this 
 The way you talking all that mess 
 Make me wanna pull up that dress 
 Bend your ass over on the furniture 
 You think that you gonna leave wit 
 I all inside you secrets you say keep it 
 While I go deepest in ya river 
 Get to flowing better than that nigga jigga 
 Going all in and then it bend like tigga 
 Ya be on ya job getting hard like liquor 
 So what's up baby you gonna pack up 
 Or you gonna fall back what 
 You wanna do 
 I wanna do you right now 
 Baby make a move 
 I'm not saying this to make you upset 
 I'm not saying this to play you I'm saying 
 It's all good wanna break it off 
 All I ask when I'm taking off 
 That you handle it 
 Can you handle it 
 I don't need you for real 
 I know I loved you 
 Somebody else will 
 Baby girl cause you must've got to comfortable 
 Baby it's cool you were just a little bit out of line
