Good evening 
 I'd like to thank everybody for coming out 
 Hope your flights were safe 
 Feeling real breezey 
 (Verse One) 
 It's calling my body 
 It's calling my soul 
 It's calling my mind 
 So girl I gotta go 
 Baby it's the grind 
 Yes I had a good time 
 (Don't get me wrong) You were so good 
 And I really wish I could 
 Stay a little bit longer 
 Love you a little bit stronger 
 And go a little deeper 
 Baby with you 
 But since this thang is calling I 
 Gotta answer dry your eyes 
 Girl don't cry 
 'Cause your making it hard for me 
 'Cause I don't want to leave (Ooh girl) 
 But I gotta go right now 
 I'll be back to hold you down (I don't wanna) 
 I don't want to leave no 
 But girl I gotta go right now 
 But I'll be back before you know it 
 (Verse Two) 
 So hold that thought (that thought) 
 Don't you move 
 See I'm coming right back 
 Right back for you 
 Don't you change your position 
 Girl I'm on a mission 
 Baby trust I'll be missin' 
 Missin' you 
 'Cause I don't wanna leave 
 I don't want to leave (Leave, leave, leave you baby) 
 But I gotta go right now (But I gotta go though) 
 I'll be back to hold you down 
 I don't want to leave no no no 
 But girl I gotta go right now 
 But I'll be back before you know it 
 Streets be calling me 
 They be callling my name 
 And when they call I gotta go 
 So I'm letting you know 
 I won't be gone for long 
 And already I can't wait to come home to you 
 I don't want to leave (Oh girl) 
 But I gotta go right now 
 I'll be back to hold you down 
 I don't want to leave 
 But girl I gotta go right now 
 But I'll be back before you know it 
 I don't want to leave 
 But I gotta go right now 
 I'll be back to hold you down 
 I don't want to leave 
 But I gotta go right now 
 But I'll be back before you know it 
 (Speaking) 
 Break it down now ow 
 Naw I don't want to leave 
 But you know how it is when- 
 Whoa baby keep that on 
 Don't take it off 
 Keep in on 
 So I can take it off when I come back 
 Yeah fo' sho 
 I don't want to leave (Since this thang is calling I) 
 But I gotta go right now (Gotta answer dry your eyes) 
 I don't want to leave 
 But girl I gotta go right now 
 I'll be back before you know it
