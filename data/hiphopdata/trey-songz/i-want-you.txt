I ain't gon' say much 
 I'ma finish what's in my cup 
 And come over there with you 
 Sip a lil somethin' with you 
 I ain't even gonna lie 
 You're lookin' kinda hella fly 
 Like you belong up in my ride 
 'Cause baby tonight I... 
 Make yourself at home 
 Tonight you won't be alone 
 It's all about you girl 
 And me girl 
 You can take off tomorrow 
 Tonight we rollin' five star 
 It's all on you girl 
 What it do girl 
 Baby make a choice 
 You can hear it in my voice 
 I'm so sincere, listen here 
 I want you girl (Aye) 
 I want you girl (Aye) 
 I want you girl (Aye-aye) 
 Baby once we touch 
 You can never get enough 
 I got that good, so what's good 
 I want you girl (Aye)

 I know they say Trey wild 
 But don't you dig Trey's style 
 If it's you girl 
 It's all cool girl 
 Make yourself at home 
 Tonight you won't be alone 
 It's all about you girl 
 And me girl 
 You can take off tomorrow 
 Tonight we rollin' six star 
 It's all on you girl 
 What it do girl 
 Baby make a choice 
 You can hear it in my voice 
 I'm so sincere, listen here 
 I want you girl (Aye)

 It seems as though 
 Your resistance could be broke 
 But I promise I won't go unless you do 
 Don't be so cold 
 Let me keep you warm 
 Hold you through the night 
 You'll be satisfied 
 Baby make a choice 
 You can hear it in my voice 
 I'm so sincere, listen here 
 I want you girl (Aye)
