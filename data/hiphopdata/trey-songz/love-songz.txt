Talking: 
 I'm tryna put it into words 
 It's like... it's like 
 Check it out, right 
 My ol' lady, right 
 You know, my girl 
 Take something simple like eating soup 
 I crack, I crack the crackers up in the soup 
 I crack them up, you know what I mean 
 They're like... 
 She likes her crackers dissolved in the soup 
 (Hehe) she's so cute 
 She light up my life, mayne 
 She does, believe her 
 I ain't tryna say nothing you ain't tryna hear 
 Relax your mind, have no fear 
 'Cause I'm about to show you, yeah 
 Shawty got love 
 I got love 
 She's the only one I'm thinking of 
 Someone to hold close 
 See, it's a fear for finding a way, girl 
 I ain't tryna be alone, no way girl 
 See you're the destiny in me, babe 
 I don't need no one else, babe 
 See, it's the fear for finding a way, girl 
 I ain't tryna be in nobody else's world 
 I got a lot of love so I give it all to you 
 Won't you call this your love song 
 Not just a cut song 
 I'm a lean to the side 
 One hand up 
 One finger up, girl 
 This is my love 
 Call this your love song 
 Not just a cut song 
 So if you feel me then 
 Put your hands up, hands up 
 Girl, this is my love 
 I ain't tryna say nothing you ain't tryna hear 
 Relax your mind, have no fear 
 'Cause I'm about to show you, yeah 
 Shawty got love 
 I got love 
 She's the only one I'm thinking of 
 Someone to hold close 
 You told me 
 Keep your name off the press 
 So I gotta hold it in 
 Not say you the best 
 Yes, you're the opposite of stress 
 A whole lot more but you're damn showing nothing less 
 So tell me what's next 
 We headed to the crib just to have a little sex (make love) 
 Yes, there ain't no tests but your carats on your neck 
 Make your body feel timeless 
 It ain't nothing to it 
 Just like a door 
 Girl, you gotta walk through it, yeah 
 I'll show you I'm the truest 
 Girl To You, For Me 
 Won't you call this your love song 
 Not just a cut song 
 And I'm a lean to the side 
 One hand up 
 One finger up, girl
