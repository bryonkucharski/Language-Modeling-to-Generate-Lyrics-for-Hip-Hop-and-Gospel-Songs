I was born by the river in a little tent 
 And oh, just like the river I 
 I've been running ever since 
 It's been a long, long time coming 
 But I know a change's gonna come 
 Oh yes, it will 
 It's been too hard living 
 But I'm afraid to die 
 'Cause I don't know what's up there no, no 
 Beyond the sky 
 It's been a long, long time coming 
 But I know a change gonna come 
 Oh yes, it will 
 Then I go to my brother 
 I said brother, help me please 
 But he winds up knocking me down 
 I got to go to my knees 
 Oh, there's been times that I thought 
 I wouldn't last for long 
 But I think I'm able to carry on 
 It's been a long time coming 
 But I know a change gonna come 
 Keep it right there
