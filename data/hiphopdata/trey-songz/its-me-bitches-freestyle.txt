It's me bitches! 
 WOO! WOO! Come on! WOO! WOO! Showtime! 
 Chillin' in my Beemer, listenin to Ether 
 Bumping through your speakers, know I got the heaters 
 Rock and don't stop, I keeps it rocking don't stop (Stop) 
 I'm banging them beats you know I rock the hip hop 
 FREEZE! You know who it is! It's me bitches! 
 I, smoke good eat good, drink and fuck good 
 Comin' to the club stuntin like how you should 
 My shit on fire I don't need no gasolina 
 I'm comin' through your block with the new two seater 
 Ring the alarm man, call me the sandman 
 When I drop beats I'm the one man band man 
 Cash rules everything around me cream get the money, dollar dollar 
 Bills y'all fuck it! 
 FREEZE! You know who it is! It's me bitches! 
 Vida loco, flying through popo 
 See me in that four door, that bentley sporto 
 Benzo-lito - my Enzo-lito 
 You front, I'm a I'm a shoot that ass like a frito 
 Sniffin that yayo, trying to be Sosa 
 Trying to be tough when ya soft like choca 
 I ain't gotta shoot ya, I can just choke ya 
 If ya trying to make paper, I-I can just show ya 
 FREEZE! You know who it is! It's me bitches! 
 (Verse 4: Repeating the first verse) 
 Chillin' in my Beemer, listenin to Ether 
 Bumping through your speakers, know I got the heaters 
 Rock and don't stop, I keeps it rocking don't stop (Stop) 
 I'm banging them beats you know I rock the hip hop 
 FREEZE! You know who it is! It's me bitches!
