Hey, hey, we keeping it real, samba baby 
 If you need love I'm loving, if you need a thug I'm thugging, if you need a hustla,

 If you need a lil' dough we flipping got somewhere to go I'm whipping, 
 Be a love hustla whatever you need girl ima hold you down 
 Bun B da ima man amongst men my chain is white gold my steel is Tungsten 
 I'm made of tough skin you gon' respect me

 Wanna fly in G4's (4's) 
 Or sail the seas then your wish is my command 
 You can do what ya please (hey) 
 The lap of luxury is what you'll be laying in just respect 
 The playa and the game that hes playing in (for real)

 Cause even the king of trill needs himself a queen 
 See all that listening to them hoes in your ear gotta quit 
 I see they smile when I'm around when I leave 
 They talk shit they just mad 'cause I got you flipping jagos 
 Popping tags brand new clothes you can't tell by the tag 
 I don't mean to boast and brag but them hoes around you hating 
 They just waiting on you to slip so I could leave yo ass with nathan 
 Then when I do that they gon' back door and try to holla 
 Hoping I'm a do them like you and drop them off some dollas 
 But I ain't 'cause I can't afford to go back down that road 
 Id rather stay on my J-O and stack a bank roll
