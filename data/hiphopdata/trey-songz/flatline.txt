Every single day, girl, I wanna 
 Get away, If your love's, gonna 
 Come along, girl, when we together 
 I be feeling so strong, 
 But when we're apart, 
 I don't know where to start, 
 You've been nothing short of perfect, 
 Baby, I've been trynna make it worth it, 
 When you say, that you love me, 
 Girl, you make me feel invincible, 
 Baby, you know my love ain't gon' go no where, 
 And I know the only thing that's pumping through my veins, is you, 
 You know I'm only living for your love, 
 You see I hit the ground runnin', 
 Searchin' for your love, 
 And I'll never run from it, I promise, 
 I won't survive, without it, 
 I'll flatline, 
 'Cause girl my heart beats for you, 
 I won't survive (for you) 
 It beats for you (I won't survive) 
 (For you) Girl my heart beats for you, 
 I won't survive 
 And I will never run from it, I promise 
 It beats for you, 
 Oh, 
 My heart only beats for you, 
 Only for you, girl, oh 
 Eh, Eh, Eh, Girl 
 Just the thought of you leavin' 
 Makes me feel the pain, girl 
 And no medication can make it go away, girl, 
 My body's feeling cold, 
 My heart is feelin' froze, 
 Need your healin', here we go, 
 You know, my love ain't gon' go no where 
 So beautiful, hold me tight, don't ever let me go, 
 'Cause, you know I'm only livin' for your love,
