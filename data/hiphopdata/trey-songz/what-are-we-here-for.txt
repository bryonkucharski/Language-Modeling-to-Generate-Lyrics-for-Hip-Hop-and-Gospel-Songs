What are we doing alone? 
 Time standing still just waiting for this moment 
 What are we holding on for? 
 Hesitating, both our hearts are open 
 Why would you wanna leave? Don't you feel secure? 
 Rest assured, I got you covered 
 Got your back taken for 
 Go the distance, nothing shorter 
 What are we here for? 
 What are we here for? 
 What are we here for? 
 Let's be an example right now 
 We don't wanna regret this 
 What are we here for? 
 Don't say maybe later, then maybe turns too late, oh 
 What are we here for? 
 What are we doing alone staring up at the moon? 
 Know our night is waiting, oh yeah 
 Do you wanna go, or do you wanna stay? 
 I see you contemplating 
 Why take a chance and drop the ball? 
 We got the world in our hands 
 If we're touching the sky, why would we land? 
 So you don't have to question, no 
 What are we here for? 
 Oh, what are we here for? 
 Oh, can you let me know? 
 What are we here for? 
 Let's be an example right now 
 We don't wanna regret this 
 What are we here for? 
 Don't say maybe later, then maybe turns too late, oh 
 What are we here for? 
 What are we doing alone staring up at the moon? 
 Know our night is waiting, oh yeah 
 Do you wanna go, or do you wanna stay? 
 I see you contemplating 
 Oh, what are we here for? 
 Yeah, ooh, I-I-I, what are we here for? 
 I just wanna know 
 What are we here for? 
 What are we here for? 
 Let's be an example right now 
 We don't wanna regret this 
 What are we here for? 
 Don't say maybe later, then maybe turns too late, oh 
 What are we here for?
