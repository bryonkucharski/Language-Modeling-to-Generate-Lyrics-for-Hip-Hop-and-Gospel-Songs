Yeah oh la la la yeah oh to all my fans for you listen 
 Just charge it to my account 
 I hope I haven't gone over my limit 
 With interest rates so swift 
 No need to scream and shout 
 No doubt if women are from Venus now 
 I'll get to them somehow 
 All I want to do is please you 
 Please myself by living my life too 
 And all the stupid things I do 
 Have absolutely no reflection on How I feel about you 
 How I feel about 
 All the stupid things I do have absolutely no reflection on 
 How I feel about you 
 How I feel about you yeah 
 Oh yes I recall 
 Skipping on breakfast to play basketball 
 Then feeling two feet small 
 Sometimes you read like William Shakes 
 Your scent is sweet like Betty Crooker bakes 
 I'd love to have your cake and eat it to 
 All I want to do is please you 
 Please myself by living my life too 
 And all the stupid things I do 
 Have absolutely no reflection on How I feel about you 
 How I feel about 
 All the stupid things I do have absolutely no reflection on 
 How I feel about you 
 How I feel about you yeah 
 Oh oh yeah 
 And all the stupid things I do 
 Have absolutely no reflection on How I feel about you 
 How I feel about oh you never know 
 Oh how I feel about you 
 How I feel about you
