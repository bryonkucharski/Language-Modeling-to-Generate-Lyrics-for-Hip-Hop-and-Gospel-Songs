Ooh I'm about to dive in ooh ooh 
 I was thinking about taking a couple laps, I just wanna dive in 
 Yeah, dive in, yeah-eah 
 Splash, baby girl that's your water fall 
 Feel it coming down on me, so crazy 
 Yeah, girl I love the way your body talk 
 Come a little closer just like that 
 Keep on talking girl you got me 
 Wanting to go deeper then you'll ever know 
 Wanting to feel, the way you flow 
 Ooh you got that look up in your eyes 
 What we 'bout to do ain't no surprise 
 I'm about to dive in 
 Baby girl hold your breath 
 We about to get so wet 
 Swimming in your body, let me dive in 
 You know ain't no running 'round this pool 
 Going under just for you 
 Baby you, watch me stroke 
 Left stroke, right stroke 
 Back stroke, girl there ain't no running 'round this pool 
 Ooh I'm about to dive in 
 Baby girl hold your breath 
 We about to get so wet 
 Put me to the test girl when I dive 
 Drip, baby we don't need no towel 
 I'mma be the one who rub your body now 
 Won't drown ain't even coming up for air now 
 I just keep my head down (down, down) 
 Swim for days, I can doggy paddle all kind of ways 
 Girl you got me 
 Wanting to go deeper then you'll ever know 
 Wanting to feel, the way you flow 
 Ooh you got that look up in your eyes 
 What we 'bout to do ain't no surprise 
 I'm about to dive in 
 Baby girl hold your breath 
 We about to get so wet 
 Swimming in your body, let me dive in 
 You know ain't no running 'round this pool 
 Going under just for you 
 Baby you, watch me stroke 
 Left stroke, right stroke 
 Back stroke, girl there ain't no running 'round this pool 
 Ooh I'm about to dive in 
 Baby girl hold your breath 
 We about to get so wet 
 Put me to the test girl when I dive
