Know you imagined too 
 You and me getting back too 
 You and me been past due 
 Nothing else matters, let's talk about it the morning after 
 Girl, they won't know if we take off 
 All your friends in the bathroom drunk 
 I just can't let you walk off 
 Still got some pieces to my heart 
 So good to see you here 
 We both know it's been too long 
 Show me just how you feel 
 Before the song goes off 
 Back like we used to 
 This time I won't lose you 
 I still adore you 
 You always loyal 
 I'm gon' show you just how I feel 
 Before the song goes off 
 Who's making love to you? 
 Heard you was making oohs 
 Heard that he love you too 
 But that don't really matter, let's talk about it the morning after 
 You know I won't make you choose 
 But your friends talking to my crew 
 That leaves only me and you 
 Tell me what we have to lose 
 So good to see you here 
 We both know it's been too long 
 Show me just how you feel 
 Before the song goes off 
 Back like we used to 
 This time I won't lose you 
 I still adore you 
 You always loyal 
 I'm gon' show you just how I feel 
 Before the song goes off 
 So good to see you here 
 We both know it's been too long 
 Show me just how you feel 
 Before the song goes off 
 Hey baby, I just, I just don't know 
 It's like you complete me and I'm lost 
 The chances are I ran into you, like one in a billion 
 Tell me, would you please 
 I know you still love me, yeah 
 Tell me, baby girl, tell me 
 I know you care for me 
 It's so good to see you here 
 We both know it's been too long 
 Show me just how you feel 
 Before the song goes off 
 Back like we used to 
 This time I won't lose you 
 I still adore you 
 You always loyal 
 I'm gon' show you just how I feel 
 Before the song goes off 
 Who's making love to you? 
 Heard you was making oohs 
 But that don't really matter 
 Let's talk about it the morning after
