16th of June, nine 0-five, door bell rings 
 Man at the door says if I want to stay alive a bit longer 
 There's a few things I need you to know. 
 Three coming from a long line of travelling sales people on my mother's side 
 I wasn't gonna buy just anyone's cockatoo 
 So why would I invite a complete stranger into my home 
 Would you' 
 These days are better than that 
 These days are better than that 
 Every day I die again, and again I'm reborn 
 Every day I have to find the courage 
 To walk out into the street 
 With arms out 
 Got a love you can't defeat 
 Neither down or out 
 There's nothing you have that I need 
 I can Breathe 
 Breathe now 
 16th of June, Chinese stocks are going up 
 And I'm coming down with some new Asian virus 
 Ju Ju man, Ju Ju man 
 Doc says you're fine, or dying 
 Please 
 Nine 0-nine, St John Divine, on the line, my pulse is fine 
 But I'm running down the road like loose electricity 
 While the band in my head plays a striptease 
 The roar that lies on the other side of silence 
 The forest fire that is fear so deny it 
 Walk out into the street
