Don't make this hard for me 
 It's not about who's right or wrong, no 
 If it's how it's supposed to, really supposed to be 
 Then this love will carry on, girl 
 If we leave how we began 
 Then just know, that 
 I only want what's best for you 
 It's not what's good for me 
 It's not about what I want 
 But it's all about what you need 
 I want what's best for you 
 But I don't want you to leave 
 It's not about what I want 
 But it's all about what you need 
 I want what's best for you 
 'Cause you're the sweetest thing I know 
 If I said I loved you, really loved you so 
 Then I could let you go 
 Doesn't mean I'm giving up, no 
 So just know that 
 I only want what's best for you 
 It's not what's good for me 
 It's not about what I want 
 But it's all about what you need 
 I want what's best for you 
 But I don't want you to leave 
 It's not about what I want 
 But it's all about what you need 
 I want what's best for you 
 Don't matter how bad it feels 
 Don't matter how much it hurts 
 You deserve your worth 
 I only want what's best 
 I don't wanna tell no lies 
 I don't wanna make you cry 
 I only want what's best 
 I only want what's best for you 
 It's not what's good for me 
 It's not about what I want 
 But it's all about what you need 
 I want what's best for you 
 But I don't want you to leave 
 It's not about what I want 
 But it's all about what you need 
 I want what's best for you 
 It's not what's good for me 
 It's not about what I want 
 But it's all about what you need 
 I want what's best for you 
 But I don't want you to leave 
 It's not about what I want 
 But it's all about what you need 
 I want what's best for you
