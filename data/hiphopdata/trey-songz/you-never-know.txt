The day started off with six chicks callin 
 Runnin' off with game and then ballin 
 And no matter how trife they say you be 
 That's just how it go with the life you lead 
 Gotta keep it fresh so you cop what you wearin 
 (Fresh jeans, crisp tee this game is icy) 
 And now you gotta get a pair of timbs and that be just the time when she walks in 
 Ooh 
 You never know 
 One minute you could be in the middle of your best pimpin' 
 Ooh you never know 
 Next minute you could meet you a chick and you start fallin' 
 Guess you never know 
 When the game seem to change and you never be the same again 
 Ooh you never know 
 (You never know) 
 You never know 
 So now you try to shake this thing that you feelin' 
 But you can't cause her body got you feenin 
 No matter how many dimes you may have seen 
 Why is it that this one got what you need 
 So now you callin six times in a row 
 And you know its gettin' out of control 
 Cause now you walk around all day stressin and it started from the time she walks in 
 Guess you never know 
 You never know 
 One minute you could be in the middle of your best pimpin' 
 Ooh you never know 
 Next minute you could meet you a chick and you start fallin' 
 You never know 
 When the game seem to change and you never be the same again 
 Ooh you never know 
 (You never know) 
 You never know 
 Ooh oh ooh 
 Its funny when change come kickin in 
 And you look around and the pimp that you knew is vanishing 
 No 
 You never thought that this could be 
 Judging by the thangs you used to do 
 And now you done with games and fast talking 
 The moment that she walked in 
 You never know 
 One minute you could be in the middle of your best pimpin' 
 Ooh you never know 
 Next minute you could meet you a chick and you start fallin' 
 You never know 
 When the game seem to change and you never be the same again 
 Ooh you never know 
 (You never know) 
 You never know 
 (Trey repeats half of the bridge) 
 Like when you try to shoot game and your shot don't fall the same 
 Ooh ooh 
 You play your cards don't seem to work 
 And you get your feelings hurt 
 I said you never know
