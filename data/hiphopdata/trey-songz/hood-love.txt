Sometimes I don't get a chance to really tell you 
 But I promise you, my love will never fail you 
 Don't you get it? Right now, we're writing history 
 A thousand years from now, they'll talk about you and me 
 I know sometimes I go hard for no reason at all 
 Put your soul through the business and test the weight of your heart 
 'Cause when your back's on the wall and there's a shortage of friends 
 You know that I'm with you until the end 
 We got hood love 
 I be cussin', I be screamin' like it's over 
 Then I'm longin', then I'm fiening just to hold ya 
 'Cause that's how we do 
 You know that hood love is good love, that's me and you 
 How you feel love? When I'm with you, never quit you 
 Now that's real love, when you ain't here then I miss you 
 'Cause I still love the way that we do 
 You know that hood love is good love 
 That's me and you 
 Sometimes I think about leaving you 
 But when I think about what we've been through, yeah 
 I get a feeling like it could be the worst 
 'Cause I've given you my best and I don't mind it, that's fine 
 'Cause when you love somebody hard then you'll love that way for life 
 You got all of my heart and I'll never leave your side 
 I gave my word to love you all the way to the end 
 So no matter what I'll be right here 
 I'll be right here 'cause we got hood love 
 We got hood love 
 I be cussin', I be screamin' like it's over 
 Then I'm longin', then I'm fiening just to hold ya 
 'Cause that's how we do 
 You know that hood love is good love, that's me and you 
 How you feel love? When I'm with you, never quit you 
 Now that's real love, when you ain't here then I miss you 
 'Cause I still love the way that we do 
 You know that hood love is good love 
 That's me and you 
 Now I play tough but not for too long 
 You are someone I depend on 
 No matter how I act at times, I could never walk away 
 I thought about it plenty times, but no one could take your place 
 Well, if there ain't no you, then there ain't no me 
 And if there ain't no us, then I'd rather be 
 By myself 'cause no one else 
 Can know just what I need and really understand me 
 We got hood love 
 I be cussin', I be screamin' like it's over 
 Then I'm longin', then I'm fiening just to hold ya 
 'Cause that's how we do 
 You know that hood love is good love, that's me and you 
 How you feel love? When I'm with you, never quit you 
 Now that's real love, when you ain't here then I miss you 
 'Cause I still love the way that we do 
 You know that hood love is good love 
 That's me and you
