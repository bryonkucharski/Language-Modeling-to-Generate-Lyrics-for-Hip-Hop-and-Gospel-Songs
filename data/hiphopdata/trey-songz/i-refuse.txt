I mean you know I love you. 
 And, And I know you love me so... 
 I just, I don't see how you could let go so easily. 
 'Cause I refuse... 
 Tell me why it don't feel like we in love nomore. 
 I can't xplain how we got here 'cause I'm not sure. 
 Did somebody close the door? 
 I might've said some things I didn't mean and, 
 You probably did some crazy things to me but so what... 
 That's just us. 
 That ain't a good enough reason to give it up. 
 I can't, I won't... fall out of love. I ain't givin' up. 
 No chance, No way. 
 I refuse. 
 I'm never letting goooo. 
 I'll never grow olddd. 
 So if you ask if it's over baby, I refuseee. 
 Trying to figure out why we don't make time anymore. 
 And I hope it ain't no one else 'cause we don't touch anymore. 
 But it's no like before. 
 I know you get so sick and tired of me and... 
 But then again you make me wanna leave but so what. 
 That's just us. 
 Still ain't no reason to give it up. 
 I can't, I won't... fall out of love. I ain't givin' up. 
 No chance, No way. 
 I refuse. 
 I'm never letting goooo. 
 I'll never grow olddd. 
 So if you ask if it's over baby, I refuseee. 
 I'm gonna fight. I put that on my life. 
 If it don't work out I can't say I didn't try. 
 It won't be easy, but if you wit me... Promise we gon make it to the other side. 
 We don' put too much into this, to throw it all away. 
 Girl let's do whatever. 
 Swear it's gon' get better. 
 Got's to find a way. 
 Cause baby I CANNNTTTT
