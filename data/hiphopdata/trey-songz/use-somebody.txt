I've been roaming around 
 Always looking down at all I see 
 Painted faces, fill the places I can't reach 
 You know that I could use somebody 
 You know that I could use somebody 
 Someone like you 
 And all you know and how you speak 
 Girl, girl 'cause all I want is 
 Someone like you 
 Someone like you 
 And I've been looking around 
 Looking down at all I see
