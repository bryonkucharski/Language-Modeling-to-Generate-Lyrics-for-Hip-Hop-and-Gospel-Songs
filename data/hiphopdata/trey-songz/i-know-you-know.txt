(Trey Songz - singing) 
 Oh, Oh, Oh, Ooh, Oh, Oh 
 Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Oh, Oh 
 Put ya feet up in my shoes for a minute 
 Shawty peep the way I do how I'm living 
 You steadily trippin', say I'm trickin with the women 
 Girl don't make me get to trippin' everything is what I'm givin', I know 
 (Juvenile) 
 I know I'm comin' home to big fine after my day done 
 All concerned about how I'm feelin' and if I ate somethin' 
 You always hear the bullshit stories and never say nothin' 
 Cause all of 'em in search for a man that's why they stay sufferin 
 Though you may think I'm from this bitch to the next 
 A nigga be out here tryna get him a check, but I prefer cash 
 For me and you so don't even much get ya nerves bad 
 They want attention and they don't even deserve that 
 Girl you miss Juv-E what you think I don't care 
 What you think I'm bout to go sacrifice this shit for that there 
 They wanna catch the biggest fish in the sea-but he ain't swimmin 
 'Cause he satisfied and ain't lookin' forward to other women 
 (Chorus: Trey Songz) 
 I know, you know (I know, you know) 
 Just 'cause they shakin-don't mean I'm takin' 
 I know, you know (you know, yeah) 
 Just 'cause they holla-don't mean I follow 
 I know, you know (you know, baby) 
 Just 'cause they throw it-don't mean I'm catchin 
 I know, you know (you know) 
 No matter how long I'm gone-I'm always comin' home to you 
 (Juvenile) 
 You gotta believe me, you don't have to police me 
 I be up in the streets makin' sure that me and you eat see 
 Women try to tease me but I tell 'em be easy 
 My family needs me so I'm goin' where my seeds be 
 I can sign ya poster but I cannot intercourse ya 
 They really wanna solider that's why the bendin it over 
 Holla at big daddy I'm comin' home like I 'ppose ta 
 With a big ole bag of groceries and somethin' that we can smoke up 
 We don't need a passion cause me and you is what's happenin' 
 They thought we wasn't adaptin now everybody congratin 
 Forget all of that yappin as long as we keep interactin 
 And we keep on attractin to each other with a passion 
 (Juvenile) 
 When the big dog is in ya they gon'wanna bother a G 
 Wanna leave way at night and come tomorrow with me 
 Yup so they can put a nigga business all in the streets 
 Out here tellin' folks she gotta problem recordin for keeps 
 She got big (???) tryna get me to the place 
 Hopin I reconize her curve but I can't even relate 
 Now they be at the red light flashin me with they head lights 
 I know how to play it like tell 'em to get they head right 
 I'm not tryna touch her so you can keep ya lil'rubber 
 You too young for me why ya tryna get me in trouble 
 She know that I love her-look we was meant for each other 
 And she gon' act a fool when she with me under the cover 
 [Chorus] - repeat to end
