Now I've done had lots of relationships, 
 Ain't none of them ever added up to shit, 
 My folks they always told me what you wish, 
 Be careful cause that one thing you could get, 
 So I prayed to the Lord to send me love, 
 Send me something like an angel from up above, 
 But instead I got a chick who played on my heart, 
 She had me feeling good then tore me apart. 
 Love ain't supposed to feel this way, 
 Love ain't supposed to hurt or cause you pain, 
 Love ain't supposed to make me cry, 
 But now I'm trying to wipe my eyes. 
 Love ain't supposed to feel this way, 
 Love ain't supposed to hurt or cause you pain, 
 Love ain't supposed to make me cry, 
 But now I'm trying to wipe my eyes. 
 She was like the devil in disguise, 
 Spending time with me and thinking of other guys, 
 And even though I tried my best, 
 I can't describe the way she made me feel, 
 All over a girl, who never gave her all, 
 Never gave me much, when it came to love, 
 I don't know why I spent so much time, 
 On a love that wasn't mine, 
 And the pain is so unkind. 
 Now it ain't even worth my time, 
 Love ain't supposed to feel like I'm losing my mind, 
 I once was blind but now I see, 
 The girl was playing games she ain't the one for me, 
 I'm trying to told ya, 
 If you find a love, just don't close your eyes, you might go blind, 
 Got to keep it smart, give it all your heart, if you fall to far in love you'll find the hard way.
