 You gave him your love (your love) ooh 
 Showed him something that he never had before 
 But he didn't want your love (your love) no 
 So you started over and your on own 
 But that anit so bad, baby you're in luck 
 'Cause it so happens that I'm lookng for love 
 So why don't we take a little time 
 To see if its for real (to see if its right) 
 You don't need nobody tonight

 To pick you up and show you round 
 When ever we up baby it's my town

 Took off my sweats and put up the truck 
 Throw on my polo pull out the drive 
 Step in your heels put on a top 
 Get ready

 I take my time every minute to love you down 
 Give me your smile and forget how he made you frown 
 Take a chance girl I'm telling you 
 That I could be the one for you

 Be the only one your thinking of 
 Love is blind so you can't see
