DIDDY-DIRTY MONEY - Loving You No More lyrics 
 Send "Loving You No More" Ringtone to your Cell 
 Ft. Drake 
 (Dirty Money) 
 So hard to breathe this air that we call love, 
 Ain't nothing worse than the hurt we receive from love, 
 When you get hurt by the one you living for, 
 Pain can make you wanna love no more, 
 Loving you no more, 
 I just I can't I just can't be loving you no more, 
 I love you more than I love myself, 
 Loving you no more, 
 I just I can't I just can't be loving you no more, 
 I love you more than I love myself 
 Hurt with the heart that's bleeding slowly, 
 So many lonely sleepless nights, 
 I'm going through hell to convince you love me, 
 But never her approval no matter how I try, 
 The way you talk to me but still I say I love you, 
 I'm ashamed you can see it in my eyes, 
 Momma always told me to respect the woman, 
 But what am I to do when her parents do not try, 
 So many tears I cried, 
 But all for nothing I'm afraid to say, 
 Ooh 
 Loving you no more, 
 I just I can't I just can't be loving you no more, 
 I love you more than I love myself, 
 Loving you no more, 
 I just I can't I just can't be loving you no more, 
 I love you more than I love myself 
 I've been so dependent on your love for so long, 
 Punishment for me is trying to let go, 
 Give it from your heart is what you taught me, 
 Addiction to pain is what it got me, 
 My life, now its changed, 
 My life ain't the same as you are, 
 Heartbroken, to the point sometimes wanna end it, 
 If I can't have what mean most to me, 
 So many tears I cried, 
 But all for nothing I'm afraid to say, 
 Loving you no more, 
 I just I can't I just can't be loving you no more, 
 I love you more than I love myself, 
 Loving you no more, 
 I just I can't I just can't be loving you no more, 
 I love you more than I love myself 
 (Drake) 
 Uh, trying not to over think 
 Only 'cause I've drove and I done had a lot to drink 
 When I wanted it blue you said we got to paint it pink 
 And there's pieces of ya hair still sittin' in my sink 
 And you still got underwear that's sittin' in the dryer 
 How come every time that you're suspicious I'm a liar? 
 You stand out, I can hear you whistle in a choir 
 And that's the only reason you the Mrs. I admire 
 Damn. Tell me what I'm gone do 
 Since everything I'm trying to forget is all true 
 Me and all your main girls get along too 
 I would take my last dollar out and bet it on you 
 But ah, you see the same one I'm missing 
 Is basically the reason I became something different 
 And just that I remember me before 
 And if you could do the same baby then we'll be for sure 
 Loving you no more, 
 I just I can't I just can't be loving you no more, 
 I love you more than I love myself, 
 Loving you no more, 
 I just I can't I just can't be loving you no more, 
 I love you more than I love myself
