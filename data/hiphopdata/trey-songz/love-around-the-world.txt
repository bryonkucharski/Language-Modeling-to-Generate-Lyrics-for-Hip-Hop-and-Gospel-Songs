Baby girl I left a piece of my heart 
 In New York, in L.A 
 Baby 'cause I left a piece of my heart 
 In Paris, in London 
 I've made love 
 Love around the world, love around the world 
 Love around the world 
 I've made love 
 Love around the world, love around the world 
 One too many girls 
 I can't expect to get my heart, to get my mind 
 To get me soul, getting my everything 
 When I already gave it to her 
 I can't expect to get my heart, to get my mind 
 To get me soul, getting my everything 
 When I already gave it to her 
 No 
 Baby girl I left a piece of my heart

 Love around the world, love around the world 
 Love around the world

 Love around the world, love around the world 
 One too many girls 
 We're not touched down, take off at your seat 
 Checking the hotel, better be on you 
 We're like ooh ooh 
 She love me so 
 Get it up to me before I go 
 Girl I'm just letting you know 
 I've made love 
 Love around the world, love around the world 
 Love around the world 
 I've made love 
 Love around the world, love around the world
