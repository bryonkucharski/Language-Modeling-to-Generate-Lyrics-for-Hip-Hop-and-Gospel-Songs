Baby we were like flowers to water 
 No better yet coke to a snorter, we were like 
 Martin and Gina, never let nothing come between us, 
 See baby were like a dream, dream of a land far away, away, 
 Had to go and throw it all away, I hope it was worth it, 
 Through with the hurting, girl it's for certain... 
 Baby it's sad to say, I know that it was you that 
 Made me feel this way, never thought it'd be a day that I, 
 I don't love you anymore, baby it's a shame to see, that being without 
 You ain't a thing to me, never thought it'd come a day that I, I don't 
 Love you anymore 
 I never thought that tis would be, a one true fantasy, turned to a 
 Tragedy, but all in reality, it was you to be the cause of my doom, 
 Yeah, since that day I changed the game, thoughts of you done left 
 My brain, girl I just don't love you anymore, no 
 Baby it's sad to say, I know that it was you that 
 Made me feel this way, never thought it'd be a day that I, 
 I don't love you anymore, baby it's a shame to see, that being without 
 You ain't a thing to me, never thought it'd come a time that I, I don't 
 Love you anymore 
 See baby we were like a dream, when you threw it away 
 Oh yeah, huh and girl I just don't love you anymore, all I can say 
 Baby it's sad to say, I know that it was you that 
 Made me feel this way, never thought it'd be a day that I, 
 I don't love you anymore, baby it's a shame to see, that being without 
 You ain't a thing to me, never thought it'd come a time that I, I don't 
 Love you anymore
