 Girl I need your love it's like fresh air 
 Kick it with a young prince like Bel Air 
 It's as strong but you never do a farewell 
 They steal but they never keep in touch still 
 See you bad as hell and they know it 
 Fresh up out of the shower with that lotion 
 Bend it over, you might cause a commotion 
 Reminiscin how I'm swimming in your ocean

 Underwater with the stars and the mood right

 Hopin for the chance

 And it's all at demand
