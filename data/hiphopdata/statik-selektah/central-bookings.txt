The way things is looking I'ma see central booking 
 Eh yo Queens get the money 
 Ain't trying to see central booking, Oh shit 
 Dough boy in New York City 
 New York is still the same 
 Out there on the Queens Ave 
 Playing the mirrors like a diva 'cause I'm paranoid 
 And plus I'm smoking drugs, you're just a token thug 
 Fuck around your words will lay you in a woven rug 
 I'm Middle Eastern, Iron Sheik with the cobra clutch 
 We see the lights so I force them into chasing me 
 Early morning money like the people in the bakery 
 Fancy drapery, rep the family faithfully 
 Criminal minded, do it tastefully 
 Shorty catching cases, couple priors open 
 Serve fiends same shit Richard Pryor smokin' 
 My speech be concrete lying, defeat a web 
 And even if you were a basket couldn't see the bread 
 We want the Caesar salad table-side 
 The waiter toss it get the flavor right 
 The shorty with me got the piercing in the naval 
 Seven bitches with me and I'm 'bout to give 'em anal 
 Yes I love my freedom 'cause I'm able 
 The way things is looking I'ma see central booking 
 Eh yo Queens get the money 
 Ain't trying to see central booking, Oh shit 
 Dough boy in New York City 
 New York is still the same 
 Out there on the Queens Ave 
 Coming from Queens we get fly on different calibers 
 Heinous with the stainless, plus we Shameless like the Gallaghers 
 Black, e-b-I-t so we ain't looking at no calendars 
 Gliding like Islanders 
 Pistols equipped with silencers 
 Load 'em, point 'em at challengers, be triple beam balancers 
 I'm feeling claustrophobic with success surrounding us 
 And fuck a groupie 'cause we been have bitches hounding us 
 Way before this thing called rap came into play 
 I change my rugby's and the pussy I fuck like every day 
 Sex, money and yay, sip the Henessey for energy 
 We giants, dropping science, if you're smart pick up the chemistry 
 Repping for New York heavily, getting my money steadily 
 Meyhem Lauren and Bronsolinyo that's the recipe 
 Dun, it's destined we won, my legacy spun 
 A lot of people in the right direction, despite aggression 
 Divine prevention bag ounces by eye with perfection 
 The way things is looking I'ma see central booking 
 Eh yo Queens get the money 
 Ain't trying to see central booking, Oh shit 
 Dough boy in New York City 
 New York is still the same 
 Out there on the Queens Ave 
 They tried to bag me for the blunt, I had the bundle by the grundle 
 I'm running on the humble, acrobatic tumble 
 Oh shit, the floor exercise a perfect ten 
 Marisol, we make her swallow drugs then she birthing twins 
 Then fly no propeller, street bread my acapella 
 Vintage raps from out the cellar, Madagascar vanilla 
 Where color kicks match your buy work 
 And then we? 
 From Queens I was just in my teens, holdin' the ratchet 
 I slice the garlic with the razor, somewhere out in Asia 
 When it come to paper, family, everything is major 
 The North American elk behind the oven door 
 We're trying to find a common ground, is it love or war? 
 Remain extravagant we known to floss objects inanimate 
 Shining but never arrogant, from 40 Park to Feroget 
 Rocking the finest ? designers? 
 If it's not Ralph than it's some double G shit 
 Forever glow
