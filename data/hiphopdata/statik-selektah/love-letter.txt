Yo, I almost cried writing this shit yo 
 We met at college for the culinary arts 
 First time I saw that ass, boo, it swallowed up my heart, damn 
 Plus you were gorgeous, I played it cool though 
 Slipped me the number told me utilize it 
 Only thing I thought about was your pussy, how I'ma brutalize it 
 Size six in the sneakers, smoking reefer 
 Was the daily routine, gave her call one day 
 Told me meet you up at forty deuce, I didn't hesitate to say 'yes' 
 Threw on the sweatsuit, hopped in the Beamer 
 Top down, twenty below, she gave me butterflies 
 Had her father light complexion and her mother's eyes 
 Thunder thighs, I'm trying to make some babies with her 
 We grew closer, connected at the hip 
 She started flipping over little shit 
 Became a bigger problem, and she pregnant, what I'ma do? 
 I went the coward route, what a fucking jerk 
 I hated myself for years and thought I made up 
 All the pent up anger in a while, and tell me straight up 
 Do you love me? Then what's the next step? 
 It's either 'yes' or 'no' before you take your next breath 
 Remember the days you held me on your chest? 
 I listened to your heart, gentle kisses on your breast 
 You said I was your king, or was it just a show? 
 But we don't even talk, so I guess I'll never know 
 How does a love so strong just fall to pieces? 
 I believe in science and she believe in Jesus 
 Yo, what the fuck boo? I fucking lust you 
 And plus I loved you, bitch fuck you 
 I miss you so much, fucking bitch 
 I'll fucking kill you, but I love you 
 I just want to kiss you one more time
