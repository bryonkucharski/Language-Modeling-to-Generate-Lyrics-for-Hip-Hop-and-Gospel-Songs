Albanian style, rock leathers in the sand 
 I'll shoot my cousin for nothing, dominant man 
 Go visit fam with no problems, on some normal shit 
 Straight from Skopje, Macedonia, the floral lit 
 Licorice liquor, one cube, a touch of water 
 Watch it mix, turn white like the Duchess' daughter 
 I'm in the corner puffing Ganja with the musky odor 
 Destination back of your throat, cup of soda 
 Uh, this is Bam Bam Bigelow, Queens to Asbury Park connect, Figaro 
 My uniform Carhartt sweats and Gore-tex athletic horses on my chest and on my short sets 
 The Leslie Nielsen of the weed and the words 
 This is Action Bronsolinni, 33 and the 3rd, kid 
 Naked gun, the serial is scratched off 
 Armed like Rocket in his prime, blast off 
 On and on, push it through, we won 
 Never stop till the day we're there 
 On and on, push it through, we won 
 Never stop till the day we're there 
 Push your seat back, the Rickey Henderson of rap 
 Jets hat, underneath a little blubber lie the 6 pack 
 Summer time I cop the musket with the kick back 
 Then sit back, stand up, eyes low, hit that 
 This happens continuously throughout the night 
 Now my eyes are like diamonds, that's looking blue-ish in the light 
 Like a prism, shooting out hope, honor, and optimism 
 Never stop it till we're coastal on the aqua mission 
 Reach my hand in the water and grab a tuna 
 Silhouette you see reflection of light, right off the Mezzaluna 
 That's a half moon, wavy like my man's fade 
 The European carry-all, color, tan, suede 
 Handmade, hand blades, carve up your features, I'm a creature 
 Section 39, I'm in the bleachers 
 Fiends get washed up like turtles on the beaches 
 It's mating season make the verbal for your speakers 
 On and on, push it 'til, we won 
 Never stop till the day we're there 
 On and on, push it 'til, we won 
 Never stop till the day we're there 
 I'll prosciutto, legend, Phil Rizzuto 
 Marijuana like the pussy, I keep it crudo 
 That's raw, now I declare war 
 You in the women's league 
 I show you how a man score 
 Look at my beard and my body like a grizzly 
 I'm shoulder pressing 3 plates 
 Obama, EBT. I'm a G, supermarket sweepstakes 
 Still drinking vintage out the bottle with the cheese plate 
 The Derek Harper with the low Caesar, flow fever 
 More than likely digging in your ho's beaver 
 Drug smoke to my neck just like a turkey 
 Dough dirty, make your brother do a curtsy. no mercy, Van Buren cop Hershey 
 Square Tyson and I'm in the mountains eating rare bison 
 Clam chowder, you ain't fucking with this man-power 
 Straight from Queens, where we're known to make your plans sour 
 On and on, push it 'til, we won 
 Never stop till the day we're there 
 On and on, push it 'til, we won 
 Never stop till the day we're there 
 On and on, push it 'til, we won won 
 Never stop till the day we're there there, oh oh yeah oh 
 On and on, what you gonna do, while you're gone?
