Yeah 
 A 1-2 a 1-2 
 Here we go 
 Check it out 
 It was a crime to rhyme, so funny to some rappers 
 Spittin', tryna collect that bill, money and sums 
 Revolving a gun, them problems come 
 Call the party, someone's son 
 Damn you guys were both so young 
 Where I'm from you catch the whole case 
 Autopsy photos in your cell, seen his whole face 
 No you ain't got no day all because life's probay 
 Under one now, tryna catch that cold case 
 Shit got real, now you feelin' goofy 
 In the club hanging with Puki, listen Dooky 
 Life is spooky, that molly turn to cooky 
 Think you're Bruce Lee, find yourself and lose teeth, what's beef 
 Here today, gone today where I play 
 Yeah that song play Amazing Grace, yeah that's what I call a long day 
 Hey we go this, I pursue it 
 Get down with ODB, become an opportunist, word to the truest 
 Yeah, first you owe me now you don't know me 
 Yeah, fallacy, yeah the fake and phony 
 For a 6 kill a Joe, a nigga joke on it 
 Word to DZA, yeah my Harlem crowning 
 Yes, the daddy mac macaroni 
 On the Macintosh, medium lady matrimony 
 Funked on me, watch the world, I hose on it 
 And reflect on life lessons my granny told me 
 Totally toughed out, supposed to be on it 
 In the precinct yelling, telling the whole story 
 Yeah, raiders of the lost ark found glory 
 In the open territory to teleport me 
 Hah, taking notes to the testimony 
 Seein' Tony tote Tony Black California 
 Homie seen me, deed me and I see it counts 
 Have been withdrawn, nigga don't leave me out
