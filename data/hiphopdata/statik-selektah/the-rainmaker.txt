(Are you ready) 
 (Statik Selektah drop) 
 Changing my life man 
 As I sit here and smoke this fucking drugs to the neck 
 Just be pondering on that shit man 
 Expands the mind 
 Yeah 
 Yo 
 I free my mind, want to travel in time 
 To a place where the world moves slowly, I'm feeling lonely 
 No one to hold me, no one to console me 
 My drug use out of control, I hit the road 
 Leaving behind all the memories of yore 
 Not of drinking, but it had me sipping Hennessey for sure 
 My daily thoughts are 'what's the penalty for raw?' 
 When I should be making money singing records on a tour 
 But I'm stuck in a room, living with mommy 
 Telling bitches not to scream so loud, serving salami 
 I won't stop until I'm laying in Ferrari 
 Long removed from the days of playing Sega and Atari 
 Failure's not an option, success is imminent 
 Not trying to have my baby raised up in the tenement 
 Take a hit of haze, the vision right in front of you 
 Hard work 'til I'm set like the sun'll do 
 This green plant has infested my mind 
 Over years I've invested my time, not to mention paper 
 Now I'm looking for a comeback, a game breaker 
 Stomp the ground, do a dance, the rainmaker 
 This green plant has infested my mind 
 Over years I've invested my time, not to mention paper 
 Now I'm looking for a comeback, a game breaker 
 Stomp the ground, do a dance, the rainmaker 
 So now I'm smoking, and I'm stuck in a daze 
 Hear the music of the waves, silent stuck in a cave 
 Searching for daylight, I promise that I'll change 
 Before I see the grave, never that, fingers crossed 
 Every day it seems I'm talking to the wall more 
 Hallucinations, bugging, digging up the floorboards 
 Set me free to a life without anxiety 
 Every day I'm moving further from sobriety 
 No one helped me when my life was in a spiral 
 Now I'm something like a pyro, I'm on fire 
 'Lo attire, choking victims with a short wire 
 Situations for the money cause the dough dire 
 Kids are hungry and they need an education 
 But mommy needs a leather jacket, 47 bracelets 
 Facelift, don't forget about the basics 
 Don't ever trust a fucking fake bitch 
 Understand me? 
 This green plant has infested my mind

 This green plant has infested my mind 
 Over years I've invested my time, not to mention paper
