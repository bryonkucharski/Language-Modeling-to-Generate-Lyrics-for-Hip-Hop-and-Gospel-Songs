All these faking motherfuckers never true to they craft 
 My style it give you boost just like a shoe to that ass 
 Smoke the drug, got the the Krug and in the glass 
 Nice socks, switch foot, Asian hooker and she fluent in math 
 James Brown shoes, the H-town groove 
 Big body slide through it like the Greyhound move 
 Ain't no rocking me to sleep, baby, you ain't that smooth 
 You want a sucker and I ain't that dude 
 I'm 'bout the money 
 Know when you hear me always hit you with the raw rhythm 
 You look confused and out of focus; autism 
 Ain't no developmental problems on this, I kid 
 Just big whips and chicks with big lips and thick thighs 
 My people flip pies, and quick to flick knives 
 Take the laziest shorty and take a quick dive 
 Paint a struggle how my motherfucking clique rides 
 Quit babysitting hit this spliff before the shit dies, bitch 
 I'm looking crispy like a chicken cutlet 
 One wish is, get rich before I kick the bucket 
 Know that Bronson's eating supper 
 Hoping the gun don't jam like Smuckers 
 Weed inside the Mason jar, leaning like racing car 
 Papa Shango, the monster in your mother's bed 
 Blunt of regs, and some lead turn the gutter red 
 7-40 ? snitches, with butter left 
 11 dollars worth of bounty on your brothers head 
 You know the scent YSL and some good smoke 
 I'm on the top she on the bottom like footnote 
 Jet head cover my head 
 New Yorker born and raised, so I'm repping 'til I'm dead 
 Galaxy of Queens most diverse in the world 
 Live in my borough 
 Albanian father ran into my Jewish mother 
 Swept her feet probably laid her on the blueish cover 
 Now I'm here see me fresher than the newest summer 
 Fuck, faggot, pussy
