One of the few dogs that pulled through the Mike Vick fia 
 Yo my fault man, my fault 
 One of the few dogs that pulled through the Mike Vick fiasco 
 Heart of a lion with the strength, straight outta Glasgow 
 Pudzianowski, known to let the guns loose 
 Everybody smoking cigarettes in jump suits 
 Kosovo to the basement of your building 
 Terrible dentistry, gold in every filling 
 Cut 'em a deal bet they let you bring the crills in 
 No English, kill mad kitchen knives concealed in 
 The staircase is where we earn the degree 
 The lawsuits on the fine flesh feeding the fiend 
 Light Caesar-covered skull 
 Eyes are like the ocean blue 
 Stay fly, rock Elvis, that's emotional 
 Nice shirt, crazy hat, mean jacket 
 Orange drugs if you're reppin' for the team clappin' 
 With the capillaries, big gun, Tackleberry 
 Tell the preacher at the chapel get the casket ready 
 Two seven's hit the third one on the river 
 Chicken liver dinner have your Jewish mother sitting shiva 
 'Cause the kid was a putz 
 Hit the clutch, spin the tires 'til they smoke disappear into the dust, uh 
 Dive in the muff break the pussy like an Asian cookie 
 You the type to shave your face to make your anus bushy 
 Tie a knot in your shirt right by your stomach 
 You make me wanna vomit, steady getting blunted 
 The diesel sweet and sour, the blunt vanilla 
 Twist it to perfection, gentle hands, still a guerrilla 
 I'm at the villa, '97 D'elegance 
 The Pelican Brief, you rapping with irrelevance 
 Hard to kill, call me Mason Storm 
 Your basic elevate my skills to the type of shit that Gracie's on 
 Omaplata, guard your nose, Haloti Ngata 
 Total knocker, seldom sipping Stoli Vodka 
 Making maneuvers for myself out on a late night 
 The year been great right? Trying to get the plate right 
 'Cause I'm a hunter like a great white 
 And a performer, never stage fright 
 I'm outta Flushing, Queens 
 Shoot your gun if you love the smell of money 
 Love the taste of good weed, vintage in your tummy 
 Love a bitch with good puss diggin' in her bunny 
 Peace to gettin' money, peace to gettin' money 
 Yeah, Flushing, Queens, outdoorsmen shit 
 Yeah, Action Statik Selektah shit 
 Kill yourself now
