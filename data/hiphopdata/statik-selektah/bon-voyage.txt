Uh man, I just want to thank you 
 Ridin' on this muthafuckin' mission with us 
 From Queens to Boston, all around the muthafuckin' planet 
 As the ganja gets evaporated 
 Tellin' all these bitches beat me 'cause I'm activated 
 Rockin' '97 Maxes with the double bubble wrapped around the bottom 
 Old Gold twisted like the cap that's on the bottle 
 Mash on the throttle, swish, shoot expose the ankle 
 Swiss chocolate lay up in the bed like a blanket 
 Ready to smang it, smash it and bang it 
 No more fruit punch in the crib so I guess I'll have to Tang it 
 Young Bronson, blade runner, Rutger Hauer 
 Sticky fingers cause that's what I use to crush the sour 
 Suede shoe like the natives in the teepee 
 22's drop Z3, get off the peepee 
 Beep beep, twist the laser key, press the clutch 
 Shift into the gear, give it gas and then I hit the Dutch 
 My mind is diamond, have you feelin' like you sniffin' dust 
 We come in heavy so you better have your shit to bust, pussy!
