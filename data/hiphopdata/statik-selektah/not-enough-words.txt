Statik Selektah 
 Playing through the broken ankles, man 
 Never sit down, 'cause I'ma stand up 
 Yo book a ticket to the tropics 'cause I'm through with all the shit 
 That I'm living every day, in the mirror saying why me? 
 Hide my eyes 'cause I'm sickened with the image 
 Abusing marijuana, sipping vintage for the time being 
 My skills set is very serious, in fact 
 Spit a wild rap, carve a steak right off the cow's back 
 Throw it on the grill, I'm cooking in the stew 
 Same shit that's on the grill gave me leather for the boot 
 If they make me take the stand then I'm lying through my teeth though 
 Ask to swear to God but in that I don't believe though 
 My man Stevie Mo playing safety for Toledo 
 Hustle till my fingers staying cheesy like a cheeto 
 Shorty on the bed pleasuring my pee pee 
 Smart crew TCN, lyrical graffiti 
 Drug roll precise, like a hooker with the dice 
 Butcher with the knife, you get tooken for your life 
 So much to say it's so little time and shitty 
 Killer Queens the borough, New York be the city 
 Coming crazy out your mouth will get your split up like a philly 
 Running through the maze like I'm Willie, you gotta feel me 
 I'm moving forward cause nothing's gonna be the same 
 Eyes blurry from the smoke, I can't see the lane 
 Swerving heavy, bottle in my lap 
 I'm looking for a problem so I'm modeling the gat 
 Somebody save me, 'cause I don't wanna go to jail 
 I'd rather be up in the mansion for the Polo sale 
 But I'm here, stuck inside my thoughts 
 I'm tryna have a bag of money stuffed inside my shorts 
 My life is like a movie, Blizzard with the shottie 
 Hookah house or Rosie chilling in the lobby 
 Yes I'm living gnarly, the 40 ounce of Barley 
 Open up cigars and fill 'em with a bunch of Marley 
 Double cut porterhouse straight from Luger's 
 Ruger for intruders hand to hand made by the duelers 
 Ginger ale in Knick's glasses, your style is piss mothafucka 
 Time to flip the mattress, kick it swift as Cassius 
 My mind is stronger than Mariusz Pudzianows 
 Obvious to see I'm a star straight off the couch 
 You rapping with a blouse, you get slapped up side the mouth 
 By the Zangief look-a-like, Bronson always cooking right 
 Spray the vinegar to tighten up a yummy 
 Smoking got me squinting like the sky is high and sunny 
 Attachment on the nozzle make the iron fire funny 
 Never stop until my body diving in a pile of money 
 I'm moving forward cause nothing's gonna be the same 
 Eyes blurry from the smoke, I can't see the lane 
 Swerving heavy, bottle in my lap 
 I'm looking for a problem so I'm modeling the gat 
 Somebody save me, 'cause I don't wanna go to jail 
 I'd rather be up in the mansion for the Polo sale 
 But I'm here, stuck inside my thoughts 
 I'm tryna have a bag of money stuffed inside my shorts 
 I'm already smoking like a gunshot 
 You know the fuzzy light green, call it Dunlop, flow nun's twat 
 Many hours, one man standing, one spot 
 From the morning to the mothafuckin' sun drop 
 'Cause I'm one with the Earth, eyes red 
 Mothafucka I've been blunted since birth, age 9 
 Mom dukes kept the gun in the purse, next to the hair spray 
 Fuck tomorrow, money coming in the fast way 
 I'm moving forward cause nothing's gonna be the same 
 Eyes blurry from the smoke, I can't see the lane 
 Swerving heavy, bottle in my lap 
 I'm looking for a problem so I'm modeling the gat 
 Somebody save me, 'cause I don't wanna go to jail 
 I'd rather be up in the mansion for the Polo sale 
 But I'm here, stuck inside my thoughts 
 I'm tryna have a bag of money stuffed inside my shorts 
 (We never talk there was a time when there wasn't enough words to say)
