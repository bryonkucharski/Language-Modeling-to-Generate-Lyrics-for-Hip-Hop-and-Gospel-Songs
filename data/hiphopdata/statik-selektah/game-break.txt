If the game shakes me or breaks me, I hope that 
 It makes me a better man, take a better stance 
 Look 
 This song's dedicated to all the kind of Gs that seem mis-educated 
 A young Malcolm Red got up out of his prison bed 
 Said "I'ma leave a mark on this world when I'm dead" 
 X marks the spot 
 A lot of clowns get shot 
 But they living for nothing when he died for a lot 
 From the blocks to the prison 
 Many have risen and lead 
 But I can't get a job 'cause they be testing my peace 
 Man, I keep it real I got tired of calling in sick 
 Waiting for an A&R to come and find me in the sticks 
 Ain't had the money for school, so I applied for scholarships 
 From black and Indian roots, it's amazing what you get 
 Was I wonderfully crafted to piss and pay taxes 
 Made a reflective master and lay on the mad tricks, get up, get out 
 Get something man, cultivate a creation 
 Don't blame it on your lack of education 
 Go to church, go to school, Walk the earth, watch the news 
 Type a person that hates what he learns called a fool 
 Type a person that don't want to work called skinny 
 Type of person that learns and applies I call winning 
 You were wired to be hungry for more than what you currently are 
 But you spoiled your appetite on these mediocre bars 
 Mediocre stars is all they shooting for 
 It's a wonder why we rarely get far 
 She got Bette Davis eyes, Phyllis Diller grill 
 The game that she's name is such a killer ville! 
 Killed to be killed, you might end up in a dirt 
 With no guarantee to end up on a shirt 
 Made to work hard up until the coffin 
 So when you're hard at work, you don't get to see death's cousin often 
 But why rest? When the rest of the world is like yo 
 Grown man, you need to drop up some pearls! 
 Them legends from the ground up pulled me through school 
 Had me run up on stage and look 'em dead in they eyes 
 Known to do the same, school the newest to the games 
 So when they run up on stage they look 'em dead in they eye 
 Phone and I'm known as a vet. 
 We don't take kindly to some old school title around the neck 
 Challenge the game herself to a game of wealth 
 She laughed and gave me money, but I kept my fame on stealth 
 Quiet money still money and we talk tall 
 She got her face dolled up, white nose all on froze lines 
 The snow crawled up in the calm 
 They claim they dope, stay shot up in the arm 
 The B. Manilow be the handle though 
 They say that we made it 
 But the low part check it your dated 
 But if the game shakes me or breaks me 
 A better man, I will become till the day I will be done 
 Uh, it's too much ice grilling with eyes closed 
 It's too much ice work and fly clothes 
 We gotta get our priorities in order 
 Before we go and order another pair of Jordans 
 'Cause I got a daughter, she fine, she taken care of this time 
 Or is just another D minus you get for always lying 
 Can you go and put it behind us? 
 So what you trying to find? 
 I ain't trying to say I'm perfect, but I sure am trying 
 One thing about me, feel the music in my soul 
 Could have changed up, could have went the wrong road 
 Seen the door opened, could have seen the door closed 
 Could have seen the cup empty, but I've seen the cup full 
 Now that the tank full, man, where you wanna go? 
 I ain't gotta sell records for my heart to go, go 
 Learn that while you're young, save a lot of heart break 
 Drop jewels on your son, listen to what mom say 
 Son, first was the apostle second was the prophet 
 Third was the teacher, now they all watch him 
 Try to be peaceful, man I'm just trying to live 
 Cause Lord knows I had problems at my momma crib. 
 Life had me stuck, oh, making dollars there 
 But the dollars I was chasing, they was counterfeit 
 So bogus, living your life hopeless 
 Up against the ropes just trying to stay focused 
 While I'm on this Earth, I'mma try to progress 
 I know a lot of men that's rich, but they know less 
 But since I guaged being rich with health, god, fam 
 My friends and my fans, I'mma die a rich man!
