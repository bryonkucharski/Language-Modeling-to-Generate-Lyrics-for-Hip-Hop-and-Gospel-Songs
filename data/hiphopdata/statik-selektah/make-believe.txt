None of this is make believe 
 Said I'm a rich nigga and this is for you bitch niggas 
 Bitch, said fuck the world and everything, get it 
 And foreigns in the driveway and ain't a thing rented 
 I drain the main vein in the mouth of main bitches 
 And lame niggas, suck on pussies suspension 
 I proceed to slip and fall in and out of them drawers 
 Rendezvous with these groupie broads, now I'm dodging their calls 
 Bet you wish you could be a fly up on my project walls 
 Serving clarks till my mama died but started up with a ball, fa sho 
 The dope boy done graduated to the dope man 
 Got rich and flipped a rap career off 3 and a half grams 
 And ain't no nigga ever gave me shit 
 I paid the cost so fuck your boss, I work for FG, bitch 
 And it's the truth cause dick riding's at an all-time fucking high 
 So I stay solo, let this dolo blow my fucking mind 
 The razor blade major pay quick to break a fiend 
 Taking all fades, none of this shit is make believe 
 Bitch 
 I said none of this shit is make believe 
 None of this is make believe 
 I can show you it all, the biggest doubter I can make believe 
 Listen to the jewels I'm spitting 
 The street shit is in my genes, homie, it's my true religion 
 Y'all really bore me on tracks 
 Sounding really corny on wax 
 Fronting like you really went to war or combat 
 You ignoring all facts 
 They done put me in a cell like he stole your contacts 
 Rap niggas tell lies 
 Talk tough, but when the beef come, between their legs where their tail lies 
 ST do biz 
 Hold it down in any prison you sit us in, homie you're a citizen 
 Sold drugs like the pharmaceutic 
 The realest overall like a farmer suited 
 We the most official, we tote them pistols 
 And we got flows that's sick, too, come fuck with us 
 I said none of this shit is make believe 
 I take the trees, break the trees, shake the trees 
 Quarter pound, eighth of trees and (none of this is make believe) 
 I chased a cat down the block with a .38 special 
 He was speed walking, lucky he ain't see a coffin 
 I really put in work in them studios 
 Where them groupie hoes try and get loose and go out control 
 If I rack snuff? 
 You ? hectic gun? 
 I'm the muscle and the brain, seeing Russia on the plane is amazing 
 You should try to change your situation 
 Instagram scams and Twitter altercations 
 Facebook stalkers, y'all motherfuckas be hating 
 Detec's spying on me, shits get violent on me 
 Cliques stay wilding, homie, stick lanes piling rollies 
 This rap life is real life all the time, my friend 
 It's "Ology," I'm known for getting it in 
 Plus 
 I said none of this shit is make believe
