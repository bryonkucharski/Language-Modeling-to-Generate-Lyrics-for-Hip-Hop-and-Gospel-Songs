I got one lit and she say she with it 
 I grab the dutch and I split it 
 Legs open, nigga I hit it 
 Damn right, the bitch won't forget it 
 Wake up in the morning that bitch deaded 
 But you shameless 
 Rolling joints with your hoes trying fuck someone that's famous 
 But we know how the game is 
 Don't hate me I'm just a nigga that's playing 
 Don't mean to bring up old shit home girl but I'm just saying 
 You love the fast life 
 Got all that weed, got all that white 
 Got all that purp, got all that Sprite make you feel like 
 Someone important or somethin', bills past due 
 You here frontin' but she Louised up girl you stuntin' 
 She fresh to death 'cause we showing up 
 On my dick 'cause we blowing up 
 They notice us, same hoes that showing up 
 Get my ?jack and? then blow it up 
 Used to get rejected when I texted 
 Now these hoes is counting what I'm projected 
 Number one in the draft, counting cash, going hard 
 Fuck a cab bitch, I got you on a Metro card 
 "And would you please welcome to our stage" 
 It's like bitches get addicted to this dick 
 Too many ladies trying to have the baby off of this kid 
 I'm not kidding, tell by the way y'all wrap it up 
 Sometimes fact is fuck it, the notes until the glasses bust 
 While you acting tough you like a fucked up shellfish 
 Hard on the outside but you soft in the skeleton 
 Somebody gonna have to help him from the spanking, the belts thin 
 By then, I'll crack another nut, by the time the elephant 
 My L stem, my doobie's thick, yeah 
 She got a nice square but her bootie ain't shit 
 We exchange looks I already took 
 80 kush to honor roll when she showed me what she learned from books 
 Look, I don't play around with people's children 
 I could sell these niggas blanks 
 How they tell me they don't feel 'em? 
 Feel me? You supposed to 
 You must think you fly in that coach booth don't you? 
 Then come and let me coach you 
 Fuck old dude, he's old news, old in the shoes 
 And I'm old enough so tell me how old is you? 
 She said, "Old enough to know the rules" 
 After we screwed then we through, come here, let me show and prove 
 Trying to find the twelve jewels of life 
 Champagne nice, shots on moi, an eye sore I seen in plain sight 
 I'm too literal, cloud highest bidder 
 Waging wars in your area, we breaking sound barriers 
 Light bearer, how I'm supposed to feel on a million 
 Sacred geometry coming from the first millennium 
 For the millionth time I'm on the road to fame 
 How I'm supposed to be tame? 
 A black boy days of chronicles of 'caine 
 The old man's pain from a fast life of gain 
 One shot desert eagle man, I'm shooting for dreams 
 I got to make it my reality, better yet my salary 
 Them haters' response is "How sad are we?" 
 Thank you, thank you, far too kind 
 "Please welcome to our stage" 
 Can't describe the accuracy that I pack with me 
 Leave these half-MCs feeling like after I rhyme they stuck with half of me 
 Release the facts release with fast relief 
 These cats can't scratch the canal-deep lines 
 That make these word pronunciations flow like average seas 
 The average seeds could never see how to paddle me 
 Cause once I demonstrate the way to regulate, levels raise demographically 
 Gradually aim to graduate before my first grand estates 
 Cause once you eating steaks, iy seems like snakes gonna want to wrap a plate 
 So they know it's the steaks on my plates for being one favored 
 It's simple when you progress with the steps of an elevator 
 Then I elevate your mind state so when you state yours 
 Even a day tour could not keep up with how my state talk 
 "And will you please welcome to our stage" 
 The wild fuck 'em, duck 'em, never love 'em, I bust a nut for fun then 
 Now they frontin', say they stuntin' but never all for nothing 
 Like shorty why you bluffing? My heart cold when I rush in 
 So don't be making assumptions, I take pride in my crushing 
 Some chicks saying they want me, they show it when they taunt me 
 But if she hot as hell, I know they gone demote me 
 Never catching me slippin', I slip in between her thighs 
 And looking from a distance I bet you gone see me shine 
 They said if it wasn't for rapping you won't be here bragging 
 Fuck your feelings, they should happen, I been here forever macking 
 Disposing mad chicks, I grab their asses 
 Pass it to the Pro with the assets, just get yo' ass in 
 "And will you please welcome to our stage" 
 They represent, I gotta gift my rap presents, what's not to get? 
 It was reset but in this style, allow my head, I represent 
 Won't understand what the method is, remember this 
 Alexis sexting, sexing using estrogen 
 So let's listen, don't need a loss 
 Throwing that meat, don't catch a fit 
 The price I pay for your attention used for sublime messages 
 A sticky situation, you and I could make a mess of jizz 
 Then cha-ching, throw it around and we on the brink so 
 This magnum on me got me feeling like it's army 
 The sticky got me feeling clingy to a wallet, I'm thinking stop 
 I stuck up a Brinks truck, call my bank corrupt 
 Tell 'em they foul for trying to file for bankruptcy 
 Until they handcuff me, this music can't be released 
 It was a crime, they can't be freed 
 Killing it, this track's deceased 
 Rappers don't have to be in order to clash with beef 
 Not being greedy or need when they ask for the piece 
 Nah mean?
