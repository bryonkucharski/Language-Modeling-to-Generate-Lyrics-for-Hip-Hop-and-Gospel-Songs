Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Statik, uh 
 NYC the borough, Queens super lean 
 Cut the fat, lame niggas get the fuck away from me 
 I'm a five borough, keep it thorough, gutter MC 
 White ball, puerto rock, black all fuck with me 
 Get your brain right, you versus me, we're not the same type 
 Money over dumb shit, champagne, give me a light 
 Shoot the shit, smoke a spliff with your bwoy 
 I don't play that game you be playing with them boys 
 I'm a grown-ass man, hit the mag at your liver 
 Then smoke a couple bags for the fact you got hit up 
 Ride around bumping Kendrick Lamar, the homies 
 Looking for a great time, never mind y'all police-ass niggas 
 I keep my circle tight like a pinky ring 
 Niggas want my life 'cause I get major bank 
 The 3-5 get 'em, sic 'em Fido, bark bark 
 No sunshine I put 'em where it's dark 
 I keep my circle tight like a pinky ring 
 Niggas want my life 'cause I get major bank 
 The 3-5 get 'em, sic 'em Fido, bark bark 
 No sunshine I put 'em where it's dark 
 Lights out bitches, my Guinness Stout niggas 
 Rain on your Budweiser bullshit, my crew get 
 Hard like rock wilders, you know my style by now 
 Your bitch know she respect my dick 
 Young alien told me "P, get these niggas then" 
 Statik threw the beat on, I keep keeping on 
 Call me crazy as long as you call me like bab say 
 Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, Harlem, matinee 
 Early, niggas dozing on Long Isl' niggas 
 Staten Isl' niggas force us to pull figures 
 I ain't even really on it like that, until you try me 
 Never sleep on a nigga, quiet the irony 
 I bang on you so loud I put you with the crickets 
 I put you up under the dirt, who is you kidding? 
 This is violence in its purest form, catch a body rap 
 Baby I will body that, pussy cat 
 Scream at your friendly neighborhood bandana P, mami 
 I give you extended play, he showed you, but not me 
 I take you to another realm you ain't never been 
 This that private stock that don't like the heroin 
 I keep my circle tight like a pinky ring 
 Niggas want my life 'cause I get major bank 
 The 3-5 get 'em, sic 'em Fido, bark bark 
 No sunshine I put 'em where it's dark 
 I keep my circle tight like a pinky ring 
 Niggas want my life 'cause I get major bank 
 The 3-5 get 'em, sic 'em Fido, bark bark 
 No sunshine I put 'em where it's dark
