Respect the mustache, my people loves cash and puff the cut grass 
 Of spite, known to let a nut fly, right in your slut mask 
 Ring of fire full I step inside fishing to cut glass 
 Tongue poll shaking pillars, you're like a steak a sizzler 
 I'm like a lunch with no boo dip with the whole crew 
 'Cause false moves get your whole face smothered like soul food 
 Right by the waist I got the Pro Tool, it's simply logic 
 Produce this hard dick in seconds, make your bitch massage it 
 You're like a forty dollar holler from Guadalajara 
 Gushing to scamma motherfucker's ain't promised tomorrow 
 Badges of honor on the chest the flesh got wounds in it 
 Got inmates with assholes that got balloons in it 
 Versace blue jeans 98 the scent of me 
 Now the scent of me be primarily the scent of tree 
 Fucking feedback, play me feed back 
 Before I shoot you, shorty take the charge, Steve Nash 
 Don't interrupt me I'll silly putty you for the money 
 Red sauce, calamari you with the feeling's funny 
 I'm dealing twenties killing forties by the oz 
 My brain is scattered like I been swallowing OCs 
 Beantown to Queens, you hear the rounds and screams 
 Where they pat down your jeans, take your money and your trees 
 The diamond rocker devouring vodka shrimp and lobster 
 Pop you and turn you into pasta papa look in my cara 
 The flow's furious, so serious cold killers 
 Who rip shit, spit sick, and stole millions 
 Hit 'em with lead and then men'll run in your grandma house 
 Clear it out, steal everything in it but the couch 
 Term Brady and Action Sanchez 
 Stacks of fair bread, clap and peel wigs 
 The type of feeling I get when I write a rhyme 
 Is the violentest blood-infested killing of all time 
 I'm a beast
