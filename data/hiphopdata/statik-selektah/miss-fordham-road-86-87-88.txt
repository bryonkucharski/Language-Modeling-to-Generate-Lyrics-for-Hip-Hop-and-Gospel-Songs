Beauty Dior, Cherokee, Pinky 
 Roxy Reynolds bouncing on the steps, slinky 
 Give her something white and filled with cream, twinkie 
 Leave her blinded semen in her eyes, blinky 
 So it seems 
 Can't even believe I used that flow I'm outta Queens 
 Off the hooker strip boulevard of dreams 
 Runways are getting trains stealing credit cards and schemes 
 She was laying on the floor with honey mustard on her sleeves 
 I said get up then she got up, get up in this whip bitch 
 We bout to smoke this pot up plus I got some white 
 You could be the first to taste the product, just a little dirty 
 Had the body of a model, sent a message in a bottle 
 Tell my man set the bed up, he built a wooden room quick 
 Went to the tool shed, got on his hammer, nail, and screw shit 
 Now we livin' lavish eaten salmon on a cruise ship 
 Laying in a hammock getting hammered with a Jew bitch 
 We want no drama, come here mama 
 Dale y mamar (yo come here baby girl) 
 Please don't get so wild, keep the chrome cal 
 Te deja explotar (don't get bodied homie) 
 Eso te mata, cool it papa 
 Echate pa' tras (move back gimme space) 
 I'm up in my zone, hoes pass tha ron 
 Esto ta cabron (shit crazy) 
 Yo just roll my dutches, prep my outfit for the party 
 Spray my body with aromas, got the ladies actin' naughty 
 Fine fabric delegates my people far from celibate 
 Hardly delicate highly skilled with much intelligence 
 Walk in the place jacket hangin' past the calves 
 Play the shorts in every season corner schemes get turned to math on some 
 5 in the mornin' shit, she looking flyer than anyone on that bitch 
 Ocean high yeah I'm on that shit muthafucka ? when I'm on that shit 
 Pop pop tops of the Clicquot time to raise our glass up 
 Right out the bottle, with a model, with amazing asses 
 Wipe off the ashes, 16 flavors ? butter 
 Rose out the gutter, we stand around lenses shutter 
 Ladies grindin' all up on my dickie 
 'Cause we gorgeous we forage the forest 
 I'm destined for greatness we ballin' regardless 
 I'm heartless so baby tell me what you wanna do 
 (I wanna suck it till my mouth's filled with cum from you) 
 We want no drama, come here mama 
 Dale y mamar (yo come here baby girl) 
 Please don't get so wild, keep the chrome cal 
 Te deja explotar (don't get bodied homie) 
 Eso te mata, cool it papa 
 Echate pa' tras (move back gimme space) 
 I'm up in my zone, hoes pass tha ron 
 Esto ta cabron (shit crazy) 
 20 below the bitch seen walkin' the strip 
 With that pink gloss on her lip 
 And that big cross on her tits 
 And she frontin' like she religious but stay stalkin' a dick 
 Goin' right at the head like some steamed crawfish 'n' shit 
 She know up in the club for years fuck for bagels 
 Her face is weathered like the rain that fall in April 
 And in her pants she got a loaf of bread 
 You know the yeast she never go to bed 
 She rather dope or head 
 I just don't get it cause Mercedes was a honey 
 All the ballers wanna fuck her buy her mink and give her money 
 Her facials disappearin' and her nose is always runny 
 Dentistry is twisted like the grill that's on a monkey 
 Lower body skinny, upper body husky 
 Call 'em linebackers she's a character a junkie 
 Still, she pop it and the people throw the pennies 
 Plus I'm here to watch her give the team a bunch of hennies 'cause 
 We want no drama, come here mama 
 Dale y mamar (yo come here baby girl) 
 Please don't get so wild, keep the chrome cal 
 Te deja explotar (don't get bodied homie) 
 Eso te mata, cool it papa 
 Echate pa' tras (move back gimme space) 
 I'm up in my zone, hoes pass tha ron 
 Esto ta cabron (shit crazy)
