Time for some action 
 Yeah, but you don't hear me though 
 Come on, here we go 
 We put it down everywhere we go 
 So motherfucker come on cause its 
 Here's a toast to the fact 
 That I'm a man and I can stand alone 
 And all my suits are made by hand in Rome 
 Ricotta stuff that Cannellon' 
 I'm in the garden smoking roses 
 Don't live like Malone, I'm talkin' Moses 
 Part the ocean, spark the potion 
 Diamonds in the rough, we shine 'em up 
 Make a necklace, dive up in the muff 
 Then wash my dick, straight to breakfast 
 Hop up in the truck 
 Got more flavor than some Dr. Pepper 
 Hottest stepping struts 
 And the streets paved with concrete 
 I'm known to smoke the same shit that makes the lawn green 
 Gaze at the moon right off the shore, dream 
 But me no worry got a strong team 
 Just like my Knick's '94 team, we winnin' though 
 Go 80 layers on the Baklava, that's hand made by my nana 
 Peace to Antigona 
 The whole Shkup, Bill Clinton Boulevard 
 Since a youth Bronsolini known to put it on 
 Already mentioned with the people I respect up in the rap shit 
 Couple of months you probably see me with an actress 
 Getting my ass licked, while she driving never crashed it 
 Smoking on that shit fantastic 
 A little breezy off the coast as the sun sets 
 Gallop on beach on the horse 'cause we young vets 
 Limited edition, signature inscription 
 Certificate of authenticity, I'm on a mission 
 Queens representative, dismember your genitals 
 Now you got a pussy, fucking with the general 
 Bas Rutten, I'm ass bootin', I'm past shootin' 
 Display fast movements, know that cash rules 
 Drug clothes and I ain't talking 'bout a bento box 
 Penetrate your mind, spice it with the mental lox 
 Fundamental Soundgarden verbal Black Hole Sun 
 At the flicks getting sucked in the back row 
 Lungs filled, smokey like the pork shoulder 
 Lash out, one second in the fourth quarter 
 Triple penetrate, pussy meat I renovate 
 Fuck 'em like a dog and leave 'em twisted like my mental state 
 Off the deep end, snorkel in a river 
 I take it back to Walkman's and tape decks 
 In great neck, having great sex 
 I didn't even have a hair on my face yet 
 My feet were always classic though 
 Pinky up, classy flow 
 If you know me, you know never to pass me blow 
 Straight shitting on these songs so the grass can grow 
 Till we sitting in the garden, smoking 
 Listening to Marvin go 
 I treat the shit just like a title fight, you sparring 
 Soon a damn Ferrari, sex and models straight from Holland 
 Lamb encrusted fennel pollen 
 When I rhyme it's like the metal hollow 
 These other motherfuckers smell the flowers 
 Sissy
