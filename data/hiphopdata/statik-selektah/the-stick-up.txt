The tangible goods, that's all I'm interested in 
 Bronsolini and I'm better than the best of them 
 With the power invested in me, '93 on the vest with the ski 
 The watch spin perpetually, time for compensation 
 Babies need shoes, Bronson keep pounds of weed only three brews 
 Long jackets, curly hair like I'm Hebrew 
 Fabric with the green ink had been the root of evil 
 Gotta get it on the late night, sun rise 
 Ain't never trynna see the look of sorrow in my son's eyes 
 What about a refill of the ganja when the blunt dies 
 New Yorker Mangold see me playing on the front lines 
 Two sixty five eight, the beard gumbo 
 Three pointers in the park for a clean hundo 
 Cream Caddies, hookers in the back of it 
 Spectacular shit, the resume immaculate 
 Better have my money 
 Quit the bullshit, it's a stick up 
 Better have my money 
 Quit the bullshit, it's a stick up 
 Yo, vicious chowder 
 Asian bitches sniffin' powder 
 Bronsolene catch me creepin' at the sicko hour 
 992 is scripted on the balance 
 Got talent, but all we really love is valence 
 Laid in the palace like a sultan 
 Polo on my back cover the Carhartt king 
 And that's for certain, hung like a curtain 
 Pussies get the drapes 
 Motherfucker know you in the Planet of the Apes shit 
 Dusty bottles from a cellar in a foreign land 
 Dr. Lecter, digging in your sister's rectum 
 Sweetbreads and capers, Martusciello to evade the danger 
 But I really wanna taste the paper 
 Golden bars from the treasury, spit cleverly 
 I'll leave it neverly, lappin' in the Beverly 
 Deadly medley, mashing on the pedal, B 
 Light on my complexion but I'm heavy on the celery 
 Better have my money 
 Quit the bullshit, it's a stick up 
 Better have my money 
 Quit the bullshit, it's a stick up
