I smoke drugs as if it's cigarettes, Popping like a giga pet 
 See my silhouette, right behind me bitches pirouette 
 That's a dance move, it's origin is French 
 I'm chilling in the park with several warrants on the bench 
 Suspended license, Over four years, that's three cars after 
 'Cause I'm like a mush, everything is a disaster 
 Put 'em in the bathroom, cause that'll be the answer 
 Let 'em know I'm sick and every flow is like a cancer 
 Catch a rooster, cut his fucking nuts off 
 Serve 'em for a hundred dollars, sesame and plum sauce 
 Try to dip the bill, the Mexicans'll let the guns off 
 Or cut you with a pleasure similar to getting nuts off 
 Your whore told me that your putz soft 
 Plus she caught you in the basement with a tranny getting sucked off 
 Where's your morals? Your genitals are floral 
 Like it in the back just like a fucking epidural 
 Me, I'm like a caveman, raised from out the mountains 
 Oriental bathhouses, laying on the couches 
 Cop a rub-and-tug until I'm spraying like a fountain 
 Take a hundred out my pocket, lay it on the counter 
 Peace, arrivederci, bouncing towards the exit 
 Asian lady crying because I left her fucking legs split 
 Dookie blunt of regs till I'm pookie in the face 
 Queens, the kids a star like a Mookie on the bass 
 The flows water, like rafting on the Congo 
 Take a hit of drugs and I'm passing like I'm Rondo 
 Motherfuckers sweeter than when Omar kisses 'Naldo 
 Get it straight sick, so I simmer up the cuervo 
 De pollo, look in my eyes you know I'm royal 
 Hustle up some money like Sidney and Billy Hoyle 
 Puerto Rican shorty, features like she's Rosie 
 Titties like a motherfucking pocket full of posey 
 Uh, elevator, just take me to the top please 
 Rocking all white silk, whipping drop V's 
 Elevator, just take me to the top please 
 Rocking all white silk, whipping drop V's 
 Yeah, I wanna be rocking all white silk, on the beach 
 In the moonlight, with my Nubian queen 
 Yeah I said it, I love you 
 Obama copped me the sandwich, I dipped the cops like I'm Sanders 
 For minor work, get your momma murked, napkin covered designer shirts 
 'Cause we eating like some animals to say the least 
 Bronsolin' bust a nut right in your favorite niece 
 Smoke in my lungs when I'm driving on the FDR 
 Steering with my knees, and I'm rolling, almost wrecked the car 
 Squatting twelve plates, all I do is set the bar 
 Call your father, you're a doula coulda stacked the bar 
 Making dough, baking bread just like the French 
 Hustle until we're living right, sleeping on the benches 
 Swinging for the fences, helicopter chauffeur 
 Cyclops catch you with the lasers and the lenses 
 Arnold Palmer on the graphic in the beverage 
 Everything I do myself, I'm using that for leverage 
 About to rape the game till this motherfucker hemorrhage 
 Moat around the crib and garages full of Benzes 
 Uh, elevator, just take me to the top please 
 Rocking all white silk, whipping drop V's 
 Elevator, just take me to the top please 
 Rocking all white silk, whipping drop V's 
 Yo shouts to the Lord man 
 Get seared up like fucking salmon 
 Uh Bronsolino, Statik Selektah 
 Queens to Boston 
 Puss
