New York, New York 
 Big city of dreams 
 New York, New York 
 In the hood they love us 
 New York, New York 
 Big City 
 New York, New York 
 New York is still the same 
 The name's Troy Ave, I'm about my ones 
 If niggas want static, I select my guns 
 Got a ACP, that's for burgularing 
 And a .38 Speez, that's for murdering 
 ?, I'll take your life 
 But I'm giving out the raw at a takers price 
 I shake the dice with my freedom and yikes 
 Nightmare on fed street, I get the chills at night 
 Chinchilla on the ground, furthermore I'm around 
 All the bullshit at parties, Biggie don't make a sound 
 (Shh!) That's a moment of silence 
 Loud pack, loud gats, here go the violence 
 Just another day in the hood, what the fuck 
 I'm busy selling yay in the hood, getting bucks 
 Milwaukee on 'em, fuck that get New Yorkie on 'em 
 A little dog food, dope swag shawty on 'em 
 New York, New York 
 Big city of dreams 
 New York, New York 
 In the hood they love us 
 New York, New York 
 Big City 
 New York, New York 
 New York is still the same 
 I ain't have to ride a nigga coattails 
 I came up off a crack rock and coke sales 
 New York City, I'mma restore order 
 Cause most these rap niggas is suckas and whore orders? 
 Bunch of suckas for love, I put on the glove 
 And picked up the Snub, and started shooting, fuck is the love 
 It ain't none, cause most of these lame niggas is faggots 
 Bunch of my sons, I need to claim 'em on taxes 
 Since it been a war on drugs, it been a war on me 
 The pigs don't want me bringing bacon home apparently 
 I'm Dorner of the corners 
 Sending all the formers to the coroner 
 Counting drug money is euphoria 
 Started out selling nickels 
 Just to get a fistful 
 Now it's 600 every fiscal 
 Still distribute yay like Def Jam 
 And I still will shoot hoops through ya chest man 
 New York, New York 
 Big city of dreams 
 New York, New York 
 In the hood they love us 
 New York, New York 
 Big City 
 New York, New York 
 New York is still the same 
 I'm the epitome of everything that the city is 
 My team is official while you run with them idiots 
 Couple years back, wasn't taking it serious 
 Got my mind right, now the buzzing is furious 
 Attitude rude like a chick on her period 
 Red leather jacket, Eddie Murphy Delirious 
 Big names looking at me, niggas is curious 
 Don't trust a soul, mama raised me delirious 
 Found a good wifey, little baby the prettiest 
 The place where I'm from made me one of the grittiest 
 The hand we were dealt, it was one of the shittiest 
 I'm ill with the words nigga one of the wittiest, fuck with me 
 Get found slumped in the tub like Whitney 
 Africa spears hit you, the Black Britney would clap with me 
 Stand in front of the court and bring Shaq with me 
 Scrap with me, brought them Corleone contracts with me 
 New York, New York 
 Big city of dreams 
 New York, New York 
 In the hood they love us 
 New York, New York 
 Big City 
 New York, New York 
 New York is still the same 
 Cocaine champions, Kelly K companionship 
 Charismatic with my fabric, flowing like my hammer spit 
 Fully auto, raw blow, watches from Torno? 
 Everything's the same, it's not a game, just now we tour though 
 Double shine, overtime grind, we getting more dough 
 Still smack 'em in the face and choke 'em out to let a nigga know 
 I put my fucking hands around your neck just like a figaro 
 Hard body everything, bought the block a wedding ring 
 I'm in love with this lifestyle, entice wild 
 Fuck them, I'm living it right now, we might smile 
 But ain't shit comical, moving economical 
 Loyal to the man that's in the mirror 'cause I honor you 
 Thinking crazy, being on point, that's what the drama do 
 If I don't hit ya face then I'mma touch something abdominal 
 Nothing's accidental, execute and plan wins 
 Cause everyday I'm tryna get a new buck like tan Timbs
