Queens, New York 
 Flushing shit 
 (We back again) 
 That's right 
 Yo 
 Sour smoke out the nasal 
 The Pad Thai noodle topped off with basil 
 Sistine Chapel rapper, I'm here to blaze you 
 Pop off material, get laid up and sprayed up 
 Just like arterial 
 Clementine nine, dripping venereal 
 Linguine linguistics that left my verbal lesser saucy 
 Send a message, leave you sleeping next to headless horsey 
 Play the plaintiff, I'mma slide off to prior engagements 
 Let you die in the basement 
 Toast wine from the time of the ancient- 
 Turkish warriors, cobblestones in Macedonia 
 Albanians in Shkup, never living by the book 
 We fill the jails in France, Uzes and Italy 
 Never do dirt in our own land 
 That shit's forbidden, G 
 Hoxha singing from the top of the Xhamia 
 Pickled peppers at the picnic table 
 Feta cheese, perfect Flia 
 Straight outta Dukagjin 
 One of the illest places 
 No one's smiling 
 There's only drunken men with killer faces 
 I'm known for simmering the mean gravy 
 Gleam crazy, my mind's hazy 
 New York made me 
 The most official, to holster pistol 
 Trim the fat, scrape the gristle 
 Meyhem Lauren will make your family miss you 
 I'll gladly press the trigger button 
 If you press an issue 
 Whether it's beef or beats 
 I try to make a casket fit you 
 We'll fuck you up then fuck you up 
 And then come back to get you 
 And do that two more times 
 We call that shit a triple triple 
 My flow is typhoon rap, it's deeper than an ocean ripple 
 Our hollow tips will hit you 
 Leave you with an altered nipple 
 Slumped over saying "Lord, please have mercy" 
 Or play the G, now we made hot flames burst me 
 Queens veteran, dressed like tennis men 
 Back block medicine, slap chop venison 
 Knock, knock, let us in 
 My whole clique's equipped to shoot though 
 My army got more fucking arms than a can of pulpo 
 Brownsville's Jesus, white and blue Adidas 
 Got more knowledge than them Poor Righteous Teachers 
 Clarence Smith, Stan Smith, 13X's 
 Some will overstand but common men never receive the message 
 Concepts like I'm Frank Butcher 
 Neighborhood pusher, 62's through ya sub woofer 
 Unca nunca for the pitbulls with red noses 
 Wet bogies dipped in shit to stop bodies from decomposing 
 Cool, calm and collected 
 Keep my composure 
 All my business in black and white like negative exposures 
 Keep a Polaroid for the posers 
 A picture's worth a thousand words 
 So lock and load up 
 You don't know me from a hole in a commode, bruh 
 I am the shit, just ask your bitch 
 I bet she know, yup 
 It's St. Maffew 
 Truffles in that duffle 
 Princess in the catsuit 
 This is dope fiend rap 
 Have a nigga leaning sideways 
 Frankie Blue Eye shit 
 I do it my way 
 Legendary, scary, February Valentine murder 
 Ike Turner, gun butt with a nice burner 
 Bluey spot guzzler 
 Long Island Tea sipper 
 Mind of a killer 
 Trenchcoat Mafia nigga 
 Hollow point slinger 
 Smile while I'm flipping fingers 
 Angels and demons 
 Mellowed out, Stylistic singer 
 Corner store postup 
 Backstreet wanderer 
 Butter your toast up 
 Tight pussy conqueror 
 Smart aleck, talk back, type of nigga 
 Fuck you 
 Disrespect your mother, your brother 
 Father and son, too (everybody!) 
 Long live the music 'cause it's part of my blood 
 But how long can I stay breathing 
 Only God is my judge 
 Through the lights, cameras and action 
 Glammer, glitters and gold 
 Every legend repping my era 
 Carries part of my soul 
 (90's, nigga)
