Pussy rap, dental damn beaver trap 
 That thrill is gone, I'm here to bring the fever back 
 To the streets, pumping out the big whips 
 Torpedo rhymes strong enough to sink ships 
 Two tone grip, Brother Mouzone shit 
 Better move on bitch, or else it's on, trick 
 I'm en fuego, I ain't even in my zone yet 
 I spit the shit to make you're motherfuckin' dome sweat 
 Queens-bred, no Packer but a cheese head 
 Fat ass, fucking pussy until she's dead 
 Suede foot, looking like an Indian 
 Cuisine, straight from the Caribbean 
 Long jackets, made from an amphibian 
 Bag of money, split with my committee and 
 Break it down, vision on the dollars 
 Dipping the impalas, chilling with my scholars 
 Get it? 
 I am not illiterate 
 Not, not! 
 Not even a little bit! 
 Straight up, I make the music just for you! 
 Nothing, nothing like an idiot! 
 Get it? 
 I am not illiterate 
 Not, not! 
 Not even a little bit! 
 Straight up, I make the music just for you! 
 Nothing, nothing like an idiot! 
 Call me John Bon Journo, hopping out the Volvo 
 Ratchet on the leg, dipping from the po-po! 
 Since a youth I've been labeled as a loco 
 I sell it but I never laced the nasal with the coco 
 Urban hippie, muffle with the green thumbs 
 Seven grams a purple to my neck'll leave my feet numb 
 Scoop a bitch, Portuguese sweet buns 
 Serve a dick like an elephant that's three tons 
 Her pussy whistle like my father out the window 
 Remind us that it's dinner time I'm lighting up the Indo 
 And when I go inside I think I might just play Nintendo 
 Call a Shortie from the heights have her play with my colembo 
 Uh, just let me catch my little breath an shit you won't accept a kid 
 Cause your destiny is for deficit 
 Me, you see I spit like epileptic shit 
 That's two options; it's either you fear me or you respect the kid 
 Get it? 
 I am not illiterate 
 Not, not! 
 Not even a little bit! 
 Straight up, I make the music just for you! 
 Nothing, nothing like an idiot! 
 Get it? 
 I am not illiterate 
 Not, not! 
 Not even a little bit! 
 Straight up, I make the music just for you! 
 Nothing, nothing like an idiot! 
 Mind like Watson, Fluent in the nuance 
 Van Damme Bronson, Alligator shoe on 
 Spin kick to the dick I'm eating dim sum 
 Right up in the tea room 
 You don't want to rerun! 
 Moon struck, splatter your platoon up 
 Hard times, drugs out the balloon 
 Beauty like a butterfly, flying out cocoon 
 Urban love and central village right by the lagoon 
 Uh, that's my grandfather, add a little cream of tartar 
 Make the grams harder 
 Now your Shortie hold me tighter than the dance partner 
 Pull the viper out my pants on her 
 Honey hit the tune I'll let it dance on her 
 Like a gypsy, hookers in Poughkeepsie 
 7 homies with me everybody's smoking fifties 
 990 add 2 that's my shoes 
 Reflect light like sun shining in the hot noon! 
 Get it? 
 I am not illiterate 
 Not, not! 
 Not even a little bit! 
 Straight up, I make the music just for you! 
 Nothing, nothing like an idiot!
