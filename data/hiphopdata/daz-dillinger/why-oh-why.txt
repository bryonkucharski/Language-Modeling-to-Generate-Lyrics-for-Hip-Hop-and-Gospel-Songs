This nigga to give it all to me with the cut 
 Get the door 
 Yo what's up? What you need? 
 Hmm? Yeah 
 I'm out 
 Hop in the '6-3 Chevy, countin' boutin the heat 
 Scapin through the streets with my niggas bumpin' hellafied beats 
 See us, niggas play for keeps, kill the strong and the weak 
 From the Eastside of Long Beach, that's 2-1 Street 
 See we, live and die by the gun and the knife 
 And I, high as a kite, corrallin through the night 
 Ha ha, stackin' hundreds, we kept the drugs and hoes comin' (Come on) 
 Young gunnin', tortured, no need to be punished (Yeah) 
 All we have of the system is big cabbage 
 Lifestyles is lavish, livin' my life from Dallas 
 It was a challenge, livin' my life like a savage 
 To have or to not to have it or nobody can have it 
 Un-touch-able, inde-struct-able 
 Get in my way and we're dustin you 
 As a kid this the type of shit that we dreamed of 
 Money, cars, bitches and drugs 
 I prevail, the crack sales then got in jail 
 Couldn't post bail now my home is livin' in a cell 
 Thirty years with no parole as I grow old 
 You won't see me on the streets till I'm 60 years old 
 Why oh why, why oh why, why oh why 
 It's only for the money 
 Do we live in dangerous lives? 
 It's only for the money 
 It's just the gangsta life we live 
 Why oh why, why oh why, why oh why 
 It's only for the money 
 Do we live in dangerous lives? 
 It's only for the money 
 It's just the gangsta life we live 
 It's the A, Team, operation regime 
 Money and dreams got me hooked with schemes 
 From the Time Square walk to America's best 
 Long Beach is the spot, got a lot of respect 
 'Cause I'm a vet, regulate and never hesitate 
 I stay hungry so fill my plate 
 I'm just a young black nigga tryin' to flip an end 
 Five year probation, nigga fuck the pen 
 What up, Uncle Kev doin' eight upstate 
 I heard you're benchin ten plates, knockin' out inmates 
 It's just a way of life, nigga shootin' the dice 
 Now you hit all craps, now you payin' the price 
 Livin' the thuggish life 
 Why oh why, why oh why, why oh why 
 It's only for the money 
 Do we live in dangerous lives? 
 It's only for the money 
 It's just the gangsta life we live 
 Why oh why, why oh why, why oh why 
 It's only for the money 
 Do we live in dangerous lives? 
 It's only for the money 
 It's just the gangsta life we live, we live, we live 
 G, Dove, we, mob 
 Killin' all y'all, that is our job 
 And if you thought it was The Gang then you hit it on the knob 
 Slide and flip like cocoa bricks, takin' your 6 
 And leavin' it on the side of the freeway on bricks 
 Schitzomanic, automatic, schizophrenic, six 
 It's just a psychosomatic, original 
 Dogg Pound criminal, ya ever heard of me? 
 Kurupt, Young Gotti, motherfucker D-P 
 Why is life fucked up? Toe-up 
 Scrapin' from the flo' up to the ceilin', the fo's bust 
 For my children to grow 
 We live to let go, nigga 
 Why oh why, why oh why, why oh why 
 It's only for the money 
 Do we live in dangerous lives? 
 It's only for the money 
 It's just the gangsta life we live 
 Why oh why, why oh why, why oh why 
 It's only for the money 
 Do we live in dangerous lives? 
 It's only for the money 
 It's just the gangsta life we live 
 Why oh why, why oh why, why oh why 
 It's only for the money 
 Do we live in dangerous lives? 
 It's only for the money 
 It's just the gangsta life we live 
 Why oh why, why oh why, why oh why 
 It's only for the money 
 Do we live in dangerous lives? 
 It's only for the money 
 It's just the gangsta life we live, we live, we live
