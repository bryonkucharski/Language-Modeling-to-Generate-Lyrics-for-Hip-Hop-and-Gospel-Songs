I ain't got no time for no bitches 
 I gotta clock my dough clownin' 
 Hittin' switches in a green 6-4 
 With the drink in a on deck and the bombest indo 
 A car full of gas and nowhere to go 
 I gets a call on the phone "what's happenin'?" 
 Pimpin', chillin' with bitches drinking silver satin 
 Is them bitches on deck, on deck to the fullest 
 Gots that type of game and I'm know just to pull 'em 
 Now as I stroll and as I pass by 
 Maxin' with my doggs feelin' dandy and high 
 Is that looney motherfucker that they call kurupt 
 Ballin' out the house with some gin in his cup 
 Now I found myself blowin' out smoke 
 Bombed out looney and locced 
 Open up them doors let me see some of the hoes 
 It's kurupt and I'm liable to fuck three or four 
 I'm hittin' hoes like I'm hittin' licks 
 But I don't love that trick bitch 
 'Cause bitches gettin' niggas dick sick 
 I don't pay pay rent, my rent gets paid 
 I pimp hoes like silky train 
 On and on it goes 
 I thought these motherfuckers knew, but now you know 
 Puppy love, call it what you want, bitch 
 Puppy love, call it what you want, bitch 
 1975 I was just a young pup 
 Tryin' to learn to be a dogg 
 But in the process steadily gettin' fucked 
 I met this lil' sexie dame y'all before I knew 
 All the rules to the game 
 It ain't no need to lie 
 A lil' nigga like me got played, and if she left me 
 I thought I'd die 
 Y'all don't ask, I don't the reason why 
 Thought she was sent from the heavens above 
 Y'all it's just a bad taste of puppy love 
 Puppy love 
 Puppy love 
 Puppy love 
 Puppy love 
 Sometimes I sit and think of how I used to be 
 Before I got converted to a d-o-double g 
 I'd like to thank that girl 
 From way back in the days 
 'Cause if it weren't for you I wouldn't pimp this way
