MT, Benzino, Daz Dilly 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Hey, I'm back with a hit at this dumpster 
 Plus your speakers dump that real shit to blow out your twist 
 Pull out your heaters if you're cold, warm it up, get it up 
 My niggas and my bitches get your hands, get 'em up 
 I gets rough ride, get it raw like never before 
 Hard core explore, nigga to knock down your door 
 It seems you can't take no more, so stick 'em up 
 Now give it up to get your nigga's buck, what the fuck? 
 I struck a match, I tip my hat to the left 
 I get them niggas, with the laws of death, I got the rep 
 Motherfucker, my name is Daz, I'll whoop ass 
 Everyday, all day, I count big ass cash 
 It's just I keep on comin' with it, I know you're scared with it 
 It's Diggy Daz and Benzino back on a fuckin' mission 
 Oh no, nigga I'm back with another dose 
 And if you niggas don't know, I rock coast to coast 
 I hit you with that click-clack, in that pick-pack 
 Niggas wanna do that and they said that I did that 
 The D A to the Z and Mr. Dillinger willin' to fuck a priest 
 Now my niggas, you know who run the streets 
 Every time I come around to your club or the spot, we got it hot 
 All my niggas and bitches, why don't you yell it out? 
 (Daz) 
 And if you see me coast to coast 
 Don't act like you seen a ghost 
 Just scream it out 
 Benzino, temperature is risin' 
 I want you inside me, touchin' on my body 
 Boy, you got me burnin' and I can't hide this feeling 
 Extra hot and I'm waitin' for you 
 I'm steady livin' and shit, you see it's evident 
 I canary wearin' it, I'm not even not even hearin' 
 Ya meet her at the Meridian 
 Unforgettable experience, hit that 
 I'm killin' it, macked out, I'm swervin' it 
 Crapped out your nervousness stacks 
 I be deservin' them cats 
 I'm not concerned with them 
 Who do I never heard of ya act out? 
 I murder ya, blast out I'm burnin' ya 
 Niggas ain't that appalin' 
 And chicks I be importin' them 
 Fly that ass Zino, put you up in first class 
 She bring a coat for D A Z at the crib with L-T 
 Feelin' doggy-style, part three 
 Every time I come around to your club or the spot, we got it hot 
 All my niggas and bitches, why don't you yell it out? 
 (Daz) 
 And if you see me coast to coast 
 Don't act like you seen a ghost

 Boy, you got me burnin' and I can't hide this feeling 
 Extra hot and I'm waitin' for you 
 Click-clack, I'm bustin' 'em, hit stacks, I'm clutchin' 'em 
 This track, I'm crushin' 'em, back door, I'm rushin' it 
 Flip rhymes, complete with it, hit dimes, I'm sick with it 
 Grit nines, I'm spittin' it, ass hard, he feelin' it 
 Blast off, I'm pealin' it, drop-top, be wheelin' 
 And everybody be sayin' that "Benzino is the realest thing" 
 Now here we go again, let's get this dough again, fuck it 
 I fly to Logan and Zino rip up the show again 
 Chronic steady, smokin' it, the drama never provokin' it 
 Niggas already knowin' that Jacob, he keeps me glowin' 
 And East we keep it hustlin', South they keep it crunk 
 And West they keep it comin' and West they keep on gunnin' it 
 Every time I come around to your club or the spot, we got it hot 
 All my niggas and bitches, why don't you yell it out?

 And if you see me coast to coast
