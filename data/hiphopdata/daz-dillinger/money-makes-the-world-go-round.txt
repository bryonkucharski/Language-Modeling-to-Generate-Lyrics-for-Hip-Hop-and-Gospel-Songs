Money makes the world go round 
 Money makes me do all things I do 
 Hang with my homies smoke weed drink brew 
 Ride down Belford one deep and ? crew 
 And money makes the world go round 
 Money makes the world go round 
 Living in a mansion one day with my wife 
 Stack me up some papers these days one night 
 If wind stop blowing these days than my sight 
 Winds start blowing I'm paid trump tight 
 Got to have papers these days in my life 
 I got to have paper these days of my life 
 Money makes the world go round 
 Without a doubt 
 They all want to see about a clout 
 They don't know 
 Don't want to know or see what its about 
 We faced with danger do any thing for the paper 
 Scarred for life of the street mentality done made us 
 Watch out for the snakes and fakes 
 Out to take what's yours so prepare and beware 
 Money makes the world go round for some niggers 
 Money makes the world kill all niggers quicker 
 Its reala, the haps 
 The cheese, the scraps 
 The cheddar, whatever you call it it's all? 
 (Daz) 
 Some people gots to have it 
 Some really need it 
 A lot might even sacrifice their life to retrieve it 
 I see that money's good for me 
 Money's good to me 
 Money can't buy me love 
 But it can rent me some pussy 
 You get your hands on a little bit of it and before you know it 
 You go crazy without, do strange things for it 
 Although its made of paper, it don't grow on trees 
 Unless you coming up blowing weed, while you smoke on tweeds 
 You see money makes the world go round 
 Makes the price of living go up 
 Chances of living go down 
 You see money makes the world go round 
 If you ain't got it you nothing 
 But when you come up than they hound you 
 I take me a shit and try to gather my thoughts 
 But where the southwest be, that's why I sip on a quart 
 You see my mind is on a whole lot more than just rap 
 You see you got to be something, until this rap shit happen 
 It's been a long time since I got my hand on some cheese 
 It's been addictive, my daughter can't get what she needs 
 Shit is fucked up, you wonder why we rob and sell dope 
 I go days without eating, it ain't because I snort coke 
 Fool I'm broke, what's a good way to get paid these days 
 Flip burgers, or lay your ass down and get sprayed 
 Hey man I got to reason with ya 
 No, fuck trying to reason 
 I'm tired of struggling so now its hunting season 
 I hope you understand by now what I'm thinking 
 Get a bag of that dank, of the hemp and I'm steady drinking 
 Contemplating on what should I do 
 This nigga got G's, I'm talking about a hundred or two
