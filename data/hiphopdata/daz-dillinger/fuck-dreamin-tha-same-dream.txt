 Reality, reality... 
 (Daz - chorus 2x) 
 Fuck dreamin' the same dreams 
 Bein down for the same team 
 Wether it seems to be reality it's just a dream 
 Why, eye to eye, the colors that I wear is do or die 
 When I walk down the streets, will I meet evil in disguise 
 (Daz) 
 Now I'm dreamin' a new dream 
 Bein down with the Snoop team 
 Wether it seems to be reality, it's not a dream 
 And the colors I wear is do or die 
 If I git caught slippin will I meet evil up in disguise 
 So I pack a bigger strap, .32 round cap 
 With my mind tellin' me no or should I peel this cap back 
 'Cause these hater ass niggaz only out for my wealth 
 See I don't know what the future really holds for myself 
 And then I tell myself 
 "There's nowhere for me to turn" 
 When you fucked up so many times you bound to learn 
 It's reality and fatality that you and your boys y'all wanna smoke me up 
 Niggaz wanna battle me, ya soul is lost 
 Neva-eva to be found 
 When my friends be around when they rest me in the ground 
 We blast for the cash, bashin for green 
 Life ain't what it seems, niggaz full of horrible dreams 
 Dat Nigga Daz is on the mash again 
 Yeah, it's Dillinger with a fifth of Hen 
 Livin' in a world of sin 
 Will my composer ever be the same 
 Give it to you like it is, fuck playin' them games 
 I wanna fuck yo bitch 'cause I wanna bust a nut 
 But you silly ass bitches wanna get me caught up 
 But it's hard to survive in 2005 
 But I got 2005 ways just to let a nigga die 
 It's all about controversy 
 The same ass niggaz out to work me 
 It's the same bitch niggaz out to hurt me 
 My closest road dog said he won't switch sides 
 He said he'd represent it till the fuckin' day that he'd die 
 He know he lied 'cause niggaz who live wrong is bound to live a short life 
 When you perish ya go to hell for the shit you didn't do right 
 Will money be the rule of my destruction 
 Without the money I can't even seem to function 
 It shows me what money is capable of 
 Now my worstest enemies, I show 'em no love 
 Buy me some Hennesy, I need some Hennesy 
 From Long Beach to Atlanta, back to Tennessee 
 I'm not the age of being a man of eatin ham 
 Fuck stamps, 16 Compton g's in my hand 
 Let ya to the older niggaz who started this shit (Long Beeeeach!) 
 Now I got my own crew hoppin in respect (Dogg Poooound) 
 Like to cook it, blow it up, double and triple my profit 
 Now every dope dealer wanna cop it 
 Becuz I got the bomb and I ain't goin' back 
 So everybody draw down nigga draw out ya strap 
 (Daz - chorus 2x) 
 (Daz) 
 Yeah 
 Fuck dreamin' the same dreams 
 Waitin on the motherfucker to help you out ya bullshit all the time 
 Take your life to your own destiny 
 If you fucked up you did it on your own 
 Don't let another motherfucker fuck you up 
 Take time, think 
 Be about yourself 
 Yeah 
 Fuck dreamin' the same dreams
