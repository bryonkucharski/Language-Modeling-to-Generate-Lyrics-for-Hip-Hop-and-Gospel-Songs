(Daz Dillinger) 
 What the fuck y'all police stoppin' me fo 
 'Cause I'm black and I'm young 
 Nigga pushin crack and packin a gun 
 The mothafuckin police want to swap me constantly 
 25 to life is what the judge wanna offer me 
 And put me down and beat me down on the street 
 With that badge you ain't shit fuck a C-O-P 
 Uh 
 Young nigga got it bad 'cause I'm brown 
 Wanna complain about my loud ass sounds 
 Wanna give me a ticket 
 But you know what you can stick it 
 You crooked, you bitch ass, you punk ass biggot 
 Fuck the police 
 That's what a nigga yellin' out 
 When I'm up in them cells when I'm chilled out 
 Fuck justice 
 Fuck peace 
 Everywhere I go all my niggaz yellin' out 
 Fuck the police 
 Fuck 'em, fuck 'em 
 Fuck the police 
 Fuck the police!
