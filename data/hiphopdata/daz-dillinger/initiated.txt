(Feat. 2pac, Kurupt Tha Kingpin and Outlawz) 
 [Pac] Live in this muthafucker, Thug Pound Biotch 
 Kurupt, Daz, Makaveli, Idi, Kastro, Hussein 
 You know bitch the whole muthafuckin' clique. 
 We gon' hit yo' ass up. You know where we comin' from 
 Death Row BIOTCH <echoes> hahaha Ay yo Kurupt 
 You first to blast nigga and you know how we do it on 
 The Westside nigga <Ridin' ride on What we be?> 
 We ballers for real... 
 (Kurupt) 
 For real I got it bought you the blue steel 
 Cowards hit the panic button 
 Thinkin' that it was what it wadn't 
 Shit's hectic the bomb Vietnam rhyme Don 
 With the semi-auto fracture your torso to ya spine 
 The back cracker smack you with 
 My verbals and graphic grammar 
 My verbal murder strech from Alaska to Alabama 
 Get touched by my Arm and Hammer 
 All across the planet niggas crumble like granite 
 From Tahiti to the Mid-Atlantic 
 Probable cause to get hit shit 
 Niggas best get physically and mentally fit 
 Show ya hoe I ignore for real & I can tell 
 On the DL I got an Indecent Proposal for her (biotch) 
 Mashin' in a Ford Explorer hell hound host the horror 
 Escape from the Box Pandora somethin' for ya 
 Get rocked by my midnight Glock 
 Sniper through sound vocal rival to invade the block 
 Fuckin' bitch paid the price of a snitch the 
 ?Nicki Scarful? comin' through the bus death 
 Spreads through camps like ?Parvul? 
 Young Gotti Kurupt & C with the dope and the green weed 
 Indeed I'm out to get high and supply 
 What you need Mr. Postman 
 Comin' through with all the mail What you need? 
 I got for sale on the stairwell to Hell 
 <AY Get Yo Hand Out My Pocket Nigga!> 
 (Fatal Hussein) 
 I wake up sparkin' to get wild on the streets 
 Barkin' and playas drinkin' kegs till y'all niggas beg Martin 
 You labelled Paw nervous no I do this job dirty 
 Donna Karan New York call it Fatal Dogg New Jersey 
 Niggas ain't seen time I travel courts and dream crime 
 My room like the million dollar bill folded with green blinds 
 Chairs is a hundreds for shams I run that hole in quickies 
 Dollar bills is 'intendos the windows is folded fifties 
 Y'all old cops lost it drinkin' the scotch barfless 
 I don't like movies so I hit up the Box Office 
 You the softest I'm takin' ya honies they Telly pieces 
 Wearin' my fuckin' dick around they neck like Kelly leashes 
 My boys and me is poison we don't get along equal 
 Fight each other like brothers it's all good we strong people 
 More strain on the brain and the pain I deal with 
 Ill with nasty niggas my whole crew on some real shit 
 For real bitch the steel clique I bill with menaces 
 Ya number one nemesis paragraphical like Genesis 
 (Pac) 
 Stupid muthafuckas Outlaw Immortal Bitch 
 Dogg Pound Thug Life you know how we Fuckin' do this shit! 
 You stupid muthafuckas don't get me... 
 <Overlaps last line> 
 Now take a look inside my mind 
 That Pen' time made me rise but still I rise 
 Cause my Ambitionz Az A Ridah like land mines 
 Lyrics turn niggas into smithereens 
 Music so lethal turn coliseums to murder scenes 
 I'm Makaveli the Don is what they tell me 
 I'm armed I'm droppin' niggas like bombs 
 Get in that ass like a thong 
 Picture a felon in ya presence 
 Takin' bustas back to the Essence 
 Tellin' my people peep my lethal message 
 Visions of me gettin' money got me in mash mode 
 Murderous motives for niggas stoppin' my cash flow 
 You can't fight it nigga let go 
 Witness the sound made ya bitch ass 
 Bow down to Death Row 
 Mama these niggas got me fightin' these 3 Strikes 
 Showin' up in court fuck what you thought it's three nights 
 I put the game down first put my niggas up on it 
 Now we Amerikaz Most Wanted feel that 
 [Kastro] <overlaps last line> 
 Since my Only Fear of Death is Mama cryin' for help 
 And OG Daddy wanna ride when I know 
 He ain't got shit else since I'm his only soldier 
 Nobody else gonna roll for me & I know 
 Without the Row and Immortal Outlaw (Ay K) 
 I'll be forgotten for sho 
 Plus this Thug Life it got me livin' 
 Initiated playa hated without givin' a single fuck 
 Why they dangling baby all on my nuts 
 I be singling fingering bitches to fuck 
 (Pac) 
 Bitches is wild niggas is lame 
 I hung around with real niggas got exposed to the game 
 Muthafuckas actin' crazy bustin' me in the jaw 
 Initiated as an Outlaw hahahaha (yeah muthafucka) 
 (Daz) 
 Now a mission ain't a mission if nobody rides 
 And a mission ain't a mission if nobody dies 
 And a mission ain't complete if the enemy don't sleep 
 Enemies rest in peace deceased fuckin' with me 
 I got to 'complish a goal I'm out seekin' gold 
 Expose the strap gotta let off the cousin rough and raw 
 Never fell to my knees for shit 'cause I demand shit 
 With this Daz Dillinger drillin' ya for ya shit 
 On the streets for the sixth time in and out for the crime 
 I rates crimes add up in food stamp dollars and dimes 
 I'm slippin' slidin' fucked up nigga whuttup 
 In the cut flossin' like a muthafucka whuttup 
 Beside all being now tell me where ya comin' from 
 That ain't where I see thangs and nigga what's the outcome 
 (Idi Amin) 
 For so many days and so many ways we been duckin' strays 
 They delivers but still we some Bad Boy killers 
 Hold the scrillas I dump in you niggas' livers 
 Then watch ya body shiver and ya mama quiver 
 From the way you just got lit up 
 Hit up the Westside on my way out 
 Y'all whole crew should've knew it was on 
 From Makaveli's first day out now y'all gettin' played out 
 And laid out for public display on this day 
 Y'all niggas is historay cause the whole crew is bitch to me 
 Listen to me Idi How many of y'all can see me? 
 'Cause I'll tack that ass like A's attack DC 
 Believe me 'cause although now I'm just a young stolder 
 I'm soon to be a gun holder Initiate to the clique 
 With a left to my lip now the fight's over 
 <Gunshots till end>
