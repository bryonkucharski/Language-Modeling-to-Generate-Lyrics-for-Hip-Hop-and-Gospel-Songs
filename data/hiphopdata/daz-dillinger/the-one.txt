Yeah, this 'bout that one man 
 You know tha one 
 The one you been through most shit with 
 One you don't fuck around, who came back home to 
 She was down with me way before 
 For what I've been through the mostly that I can't let go 
 She know just what to say to get a rise outta me 
 She know just what to say to get the lies outta me 
 She's the one, it's so hard for me to leave her 
 The one, I really feel like I need her 
 The one, ain't nobody else like she 
 And she lovin' nigga just for me, I'm talkin' about the one 
 She was my lover, my best friend, just like the homie 
 The only one in the world I could say that truly know me 
 Anythin' I desire my boost, she made it happin' 
 The back bone of my gangsterism that keep me balanced 
 With the paper at the game, broken up with some name 
 No matter what she would treat me the same 
 But I was wrong, I started to singin' another song 
 But she was weak minded, so grinded our love was gone 
 Fusin' and fightin' 
 Every morning 'til the break of dawn 
 Materialistic bullshit 
 That's what this is based on 
 All night she love me when I eat it up 
 We kick real hard and if a nigga don't beat it up 
 I'm down for you, you down for me like Bonny and Clyde 
 She showed the gangsterism when it's time to rock 
 She yellin' who gotcha back? 
 Nigga who gotcha back? 
 Just weather like little mama 
 She gangsta and I like that 
 She was down with me way before 
 For what I've been through the mostly that I can't let go 
 She know just what to say to get a rise outta me 
 She know just what to say to get the lies outta me 
 She's the one, it's so hard for me to leave her 
 The one, I really feel like I need her 
 The one, ain't nobody else like she 
 And she lovin' nigga just for me, I'm talkin' about the one 
 She's just as wild as she get, callin' the police 
 Threaten to take away my kids 
 That scammed the shit, that won't keep none of us stable 
 Our character mind is like the devil and angel 
 Our attitude is messed up, me and the motherly 
 The ghetto relationships that you go through as lovers 
 The wrong choice to begin with 
 Slam it on usin' profanities, tryin' get me locked up quick 
 Pushin' and shove in', fightin' and fusin' 
 Well, we made up like that, with a lotta kissin' and fuckin' 
 She forgave me, I forgave you, it's back like we were 
 Now I understand the meanin' of her 
 She was down with me way before 
 For what I've been through the mostly that I can't let go 
 She know just what to say to get a rise outta me 
 She know just what to say to get the lies outta me 
 She's the one, it's so hard for me to leave her 
 The one, I really feel like I need her 
 The one, ain't nobody else like she 
 And she lovin' nigga just for me, I'm talkin' about the one 
 T L to the L B C 
 Rappin' for the hood, real B I G 
 Every city we go we see the same old hoes 
 You're already slow, I got the one at home 
 Ridin', lovin' and would've smoke we eat good 
 Gotta be the one from the same hood 
 You know, hey, you know I can't let it go 
 Gotta be the one 
 She was down with me way before 
 For what I've been through the mostly that I can't let go 
 She know just what to say to get a rise outta me 
 She know just what to say to get the lies outta me 
 She's the one, it's so hard for me to leave her 
 The one, I really feel like I need her 
 The one and ain't nobody else like she 
 And she lovin' nigga just for me, I'm talkin' about the one 
 She was down with me way before 
 For what I've been through the mostly that I can't let go 
 She know just what to say to get a rise outta me 
 She know just what to say to get the lies outta me 
 She's the one, it's so hard for me to leave her 
 The one, I really feel like I need her 
 The one and ain't nobody else like she 
 And she lovin' nigga just for me, I'm talkin' about the one
