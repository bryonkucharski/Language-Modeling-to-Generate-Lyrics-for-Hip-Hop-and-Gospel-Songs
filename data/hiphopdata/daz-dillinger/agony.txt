(Latoya Williams) 
 Ooh... 
 Hi, my name is Latoya Williams 
 And this is a story about; my man 
 You see ladies, I had this man about, two or three years ago 
 And boy did I love my man 
 But somethin' awful happened, mmm 
 And they took him away for awhile {*door slamming*} 
 Now I know some of you ladies out there know what I'm talkin' about 
 Here's my story... 
 I'm feelin' so lonely, lonely, lonely, lone 
 As I sit by the phone, mmm 
 Days are long, nights are cold 
 There's no one home, but me 
 What am I to do? - I find myself, 
 Callin you, over and over and over 
 Please, pleeease, come and rescue me 
 From all this pain, all this pain, and agony! Ooh! 
 (But all, I have is time without you) 
 And that's not good, oh no! 
 (It hurts, to know there's nothin' I can do) 
 If I could, but I gotta try (try) and do it! (do it) 
 'Cause your not here, and I'm so alone without you! (you) 
 So I'll do it (do it) 
 Sometimes! It hurts so much that I cry! (cry) 
 And I bawl (mmmmmmm) 
 'Cause my baby, my baby, my baby ain't home 
 Ooh no! 
 Ooh, oh-ho-ho 
 *More harmonizing* 
 My baby, my baby... 
 (But all, I have is time without you) 
 And that's not good, oh no no no! 
 (It hurts, to know there's nothin' I can do) 
 If I could, but I gotta try (try) and do it! (do it) 
 'Cause your not here, and I'm so alone without you! (you) 
 Sometimes! It hurts and then I cry! (cry) 
 And I bawl (mmmmmmm) 
 'Cause my baby, my baby, my baby ain't home 
 Oh! Ooh-ooh-ooh...
