 Mamamamamamamash for our dreams 
 Mamamash for our dreams 
 Mamamash for our dreams 
 They say I'm goin' out off my mind 
 Complete the potion, homicidal blindness 
 Gotta buck with a mission to violence 
 To please the silence 
 Hear the whispers of my fo'-five, 
 Disturbed from struggles, 
 The thuggest in us, it can never bound us 
 Who can I trust, don't give a fuck 
 I'm out to get the juice and take the bucks 
 Hit 'em up, with the (?) why they murder us 
 But when the tear drops, and the few you bleedin' 
 So and let go 
 And feel 
 Fuck the famous, all about the game and the deal 
 Cause it is me (?superextraflibberous dixtoted?) when my finger hits 
 The shit in every move I make 
 Legit with every cooler break 
 Concentration never broke and not a single word spoken 
 Until I greet 'em smokin', leave 'em chokin' 
 That's some wide open 
 Dear diary, 
 Forgive me Father I'm a don breed 
 Check me with Hail-Mary's 
 And pray that I won't crush my seed 
 Crush my bloody sequency, 
 Consume me with Hennesey 
 'Cause I'ma do this to death 
 Until my final breath, leave me 
 Who the fuck can stop me when I mash for our dreams 
 Me, Noble, Daz and Storm, mamash for our dreams 
 Al my gangbang niggaz better mash for our dreams 
 Who the fuck can stop me when I mamash for our dreams 
 Haha, all my niggaz in jail mash for our dreams 
 All my essays, why'all we mash for our dreams 
 Who the fuck can stop me when I mash for my dreams 
 Mash for your dreams, nigga mash for your dreams 
 Ah, Hell 
 Another killer see from the firm g's, 
 Mission to be the baddest Outlaw from the baby rattle 
 Looking in the shadows, mind over matter 
 Conditions to splatter 
 Enemies comin' for me in battle 
 I raise my hand and Outlaw, 
 No one before has took the torch 
 Now motherfuckers gonna feel my wrath in war 
 I got some itchy finger trippin' niggers ready for war (OUTLAWZ) 
 We even in the score, checking out your ranks and boats 
 Come back and feel the force 
 Reckon Outlawz, like we're yours 
 Are you a friend or fo' 
 Empty your mind reveal the truth mo' 
 On the mash for glory, never control 
 Forfill my prophet's final story 
 Get an eye for me, ride for me 
 Make 'em sorry and recognize who'll die for me 
 It ain't over till you breathin' in me 
 As a blblast for the dreams 
 Mamamamamamamamash for our dreams 
 Haha, mamash, mash, mash, mash for our dreams

 All my niggas they better mash for our dreams 
 Don't stop, don't quit better (mamash, mash, mash) mash for our dream 
 All my niggas in jail mash for our dreams (Mamamash for our dreams) 
 All my niggas who died mash for our dreams (Mamamash for our dreams) 
 Mash for our dreams 
 Peep the scene and whatever's goin' on around me 
 Brain kinda cloudy, smoked out with no cavi 
 Won't work, it's over here nigga (Over here nigga) 
 Make sure when you diss a motherfucker make it clear nigga 
 They sent me on O-you-T-LAW you 
 Style is straight garbage 
 Spittin' that nonsense 
 Rap packing on contact 
 Instantly, rhyme for rhyme 
 Who want to scrimmage me 
 Thicker tempt then me, 
 You're just a saggy as a Wallabee 
 And obviously I'm stiff and strict with it 
 Bitches ride dick and say: "Got a nigga sick with it" 
 Stick to the real shit 
 Flow slower than (?) 
 Vicinity mixed, if he can't 
 It only didn't rain clear 
 Jock the VN for Joe Clair 
 Original done clock with no fear 
 Shout out to be the eye 
 Put on necks yo by Idi Amin 
 For green, niggas shaking, it ain't never seen my whole team 
 Secret to war, Outlawz rush the floor 
 Kill the Kadafi, thug in peace 
 You get caught slippin', get blood in the streets (More 4x) 
 Even if you're packin' yours 
 Lost souls perform fo'-fo's 
 Why-O-you-N-G, N-O-be -L-E 
 Mash for new streets 
 Slugger, eat MC's like meatloaves (Ssssshhhhhttttt) 
 For that they want to blast and put a fast one in ya 
 Knowin' I puff, then walk around with Pac' acid in me 
 Get just as dirty as birth, 
 Or maybe ever worse son, 
 Stressed like niggas but no checks on the first 
 Mob dude told me it was gonna be days like this 
 The dude never told me how to get paid like this 
 I mash for my dreams 
 Who can stop me when I mash for our dreams 
 (Mamash, mash, mash, mash for our dreams) 
 All my new niggas alive better mash for our dreams 
 All my Outlaw niggas better mash for our dreams
