Forward and fiaca 
 Menacle and den gosaca. 
 Stop that train I want to get on 
 My baby she's leaving me now. 
 Did you hear that 
 Express yourself brother 
 Stop that train I want to get on 
 My baby she's leaving me now 
 And she really first got the train towards another guy 
 And I really can't believe she's gone and was telling a lie 
 Good God 
 And I tell you that the girl has really left I to cry 
 When she went bye bye 
 Good gracious 
 Stop that train I want to get on 
 Draw your brakes brother I just can't take it 
 'Cause the girl has really gone 
 Stop that train I want to get on 
 And the girl is gone for true 
 Goodness gracious 
 Skylarker 
 Play your guitar brother 
 'Cause this is indeed a sad song 
 She said she was going on the morning train 
 And all now I don't see she personal to talk to her again 
 That means she have a guy forward away with her 
 And I just can't take it no more 
 Stop that train. 
 See I express I-self. 
 Draw your brakes brother 
 'Cause you really taking my girl away from me 
 Stop that train, I want to get on 
 I can't even hold on to the back of the train
