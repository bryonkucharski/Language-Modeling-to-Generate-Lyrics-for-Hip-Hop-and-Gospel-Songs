What a surpriser, Open your eyes, A Woman advisor 
 The name of this entertainement is 'Women lose weight' 
 Our first years of marriage everything was just great 
 But after two kids And a weight gain factor 
 The fact is Now she's completely unattractive 
 Look fat chicks I don't mean to sound rude 
 I tell her nice hit the gym And don't eat so much food 
 But no Your shallow 
 You need to run the course of unconditionnal love and so forth 
 But how if desire's is not there That's just delayment 
 Divorce is, child support, alimony payments 
 My happiness I doubt discouraged 
 So hurry for an easier way out of this marriage 
 Meanwhile my secretary June well groomed 
 When you gonna leave your wife I tell her soon mommy soon, I assume 
 Or my destiny is blue Interestingly The only thing left for me to do is to kill her 
 What a surpriser, Open your eyes, A Woman advisor 
 I'm gonna have to kill her 
 Of course there's laws which enforces divorces 
 Send that ass right to the morgue miss 
 What a surpriser, Open your eyes, A Woman advisor

 Of course there's laws which enforces divorces 
 Send that ass right to the morgue miss 
 My plans against or shenanigans Kinda ran thin 
 Knowin' nothing about poisoning And I can't swim 
 Bad intentions pumping Might as well become numb 
 Cut her lungs or the obvious robbery gone wrong 
 But the catch is do I have the nerve to dispatch this 
 Who can I get to help me murder this fat chick 
 I guess I'll have to play a dude robbin 
 On Wednesday The day she usually goes food shopping 
 Anyway long story short hit the side of her Chrysler 
 And sent her clean over the divider 
 "You bastard" she said 
 As the wreck went tumblin down the hill I thought "she has to be dead" 
 Later on get a call (from a) Lieutenant O'Rourke 
 (Had me) leapin like a frog We need you at the morgue 
 So I selfishly pursue 
 "Boohoo" there was nothing else for me to do I had to kill her 
 What a surpriser, Open your eyes, A Woman advisor 
 C'mon y'all know I had to kill her 
 Of course there's laws which enforces divorces 
 Send that ass right to the morgue miss Kill her

 I had to kill her 
 Of course there's laws which enforces divorces

 So you mean to tell me officer you don't have no clue who did this hit and run 
 No sir we don't have no clues right now 
 This is terrible what am I gonna tell the kids? 
 Pull yourself together sir 
 I'm so broken up inside I just can't believe this 
 I understand, I understand 
 Catch the person who did this 
 We're gonna try sir Please 
 Screamin "who done took my heart" acting shakin up a lot 
 At the funeral though everyone was lookin' at me odd like I did it 
 Like I was the reason my mates slain murmuring 
 "I heard he was displeased with her weight gain" 
 While my secretary sort of a sexy blonde can't cook 
 All she does is order from restaurants 
 All of the sex you want I doubt could address, 
 Clothes not washed proper and house look a mess and 
 Talkin' to detectives that was waitin outside 
 How I took a long lunch break day the wife died 
 I darn near turned pale 
 And because of betrayal they indicted me, and gave me an impossible bail 
 Good fortune to anyone admiring the rawtent 
 Moral of the story is 
 Desire is important 
 So watch your weight It'll keep you mate smitten it's a given 
 Though looking back I realised I didn't have to kill her 
 What a surpriser Open your eyes, A Woman advisor 
 I didn't have to kill her 
 Of course there's laws which enforces divorces 
 Send that ass right to the morgue miss

 Well there you have it Keep thin trim Keep your marriage healthy Do you know what I mean?
