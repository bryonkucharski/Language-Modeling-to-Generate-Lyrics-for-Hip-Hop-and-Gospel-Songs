It's me at last, the Rickster, Def Jam's where I be 
 And most agree it's kinda amazing folks are born from where we pee at 
 Though I definitely fiend it, baby no way, chills, clever mean it being 
 Got to be careful (... be told), commercial ever seen it? 
 Want a few hot ropes, some ask am I cheatin', do I? Nope 
 Not a dope, love the mother, also loves me too I hope 
 So I dig her a lot and although shorty honey break a nigga 
 How you figure, bein' a big rap money makin' nigga 
 Cute as a button, he tell 'bout the time we picked for cotton 
 So it ain't forgotten, hope I don't spoil the nigga rotten 
 Also, don't discriminate white, he'll be quite bright, if taught him right 
 If not he like ask heavenly father, help me raise my shorty right 
 So when I come home with the coil, I say "yo shorty run to royal" 
 Seein' as I'm loyal and livin' on soil, it's best when you have someone to spoil 
 So any toy, he wants he gets, yo kids ain't worth it midst the toys 
 That they destroy, annoy, though me and his moms in middle of fits of joy and it's a boy 
 Pictured friends, milk and cookies, when you're done with the boys game 
 Toy plane, Ricky Jr.'ll be a bundle of joy's name 
 And furthermore teach birds and bees 
 So won't be a nerd and burst herds of, second and thirds of 
 And Dada better be the first words of 
 Just kiddin', son'll be (need) a one man girl, spend a lot on what he be wearin' 
 Best of care, best that money can buy is what he'll be wearin' 
 With these weathers around, protect him, they'll say in a cage I kept him 
 Though wage you kindergarten probably be another major step and 
 Lo and behold a star holdin', 'cause yo be loadin' trips and sowin' 
 You know and... throwin' a fancy home for him to grow in 
 "He's kinda pleasin' to raise"... so baby say. No thank you... ease in 
 Sneezin', now what do I do when he cry for no reason? 
 Though any toy, he want he get, yo kids it ain't worth it, midst the toys 
 That they destroy, annoy, though me and his moms in middle of fits of joy and it's a boy, yo 
 Baby mom, under wing, though if dress up, could string 
 Line of cuties, though cling, don't wanna mess up a good thing 
 You know how it is when guys that pay girls seem to hog us 
 Fiend and dog us, scheme for more guts 
 Goin' into labor date, 18 of August 
 It's that time tellin' friends, congratulate's yellin' 
 Gonna be six weeks premature, but thanks to God, he's doin' well 
 And givin' credit where it is due, while rap's achievin' let it 
 As for bills forget it, 'cause the way I rap, don't even sweat it 
 My own when me and my hon son, don't fuss, agree 
 Though son, I still kinda wish I coulda been there when he was born at 3:01 
 Bygones be gone, there's nowhere wrong and all 
 Your son's about and since I didn't and this being the first 
 You know I had to write a rap about the incident 
 And the rose is for the squeeze, I would've sent a few no women with the kin in it 
 Wish us luck world as we enter a new beginning 
 And like I said, any toy, I'm tryin' to tell ya that midst the toys 
 That they destroy, annoy, though me and his moms in middle of fits of joy and it's a boy
