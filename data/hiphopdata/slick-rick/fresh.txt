 From the north to the south to the east to the west

 Fresh, dressed like a million bucks 
 Still worn the Bally shoes and the fly green socks 
 We're fresh, dressed like a million bucks 
 Still worn the Bally sodadadadada socks 
 (Jd) 
 Come on, kids, Jermaine Dupri a wiz 
 Walkin' down the street, you kow mindin' my own biz

 Unless you want to take it in the cooler or sumpin' 
 [SR]<ah!> For real and that shit ain't a fact? 
 (Jd) 
 She said that she would meet me at my house around 10 
 Not to mention, a nice tender body

 When the tag team ya hearin' is untouchable, peasant? 
 Slick, Jermaine Dupri back as the fat trackers 
 We'll diarrhea up on your black ass 
 Babies jump out the carriage 
 Could even fix the Hillary and Clinton marriage 
 Charisma now felt 
 To the point where even I could make even lesbians melt 
 Models bookin' at me 
 Could even make her grandmother catch an orgasm lookin' at me (you know) 
 It's kinda outlandish, rastas even say 
 "What kind fine young man dis" 
 So don't put me to the test
