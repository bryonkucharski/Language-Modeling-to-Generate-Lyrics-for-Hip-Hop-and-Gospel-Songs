 (Slick Rick) 
 Is it a custom - to what? To provoke out a hostile apostle 
 And make him smack the coke out your nostril 
 BAP, the butter cat at gutter rappin' and I'm all man 
 Whatever gotta happen gotta happen 
 Boy don't make me put my grown man shoe in you 
 And I'm sorry father, for any wrongdoing doin' you 
 Cause dogs barkin and the girl sigh 
 Here to present myself as the sparkle of the world's eye 
 Picture I - where Spice Girls chick arrived 
 England, January 14th, six-five 
 While you scream out Brannyville 
 "You old ass rapper!" You got it, but can he still 
 Sever, in other words, rap more clever 
 Like no other younger rapper walkin' could ever? 
 Apparently I done this, on this 
 Stunned his behind - out the way of who reign 
 I run this 
 "Hurry up, run" * cut and scratched* 
 "Run, run, run, r-run" * scratched from Run-D.M.C.* 
 "Hurry up, run" * cut and scratched* 
 [Rick] Out the way of who reign, I RUN THIS 
 "Run... run, r-run" * scratched from Run-D.M.C.* 
 [Rick] Stop the world kid, bring it home Slick 
 "Run, r-run" 
 (Slick Rick) 
 Are, you, ready? "run" 
 The fact is, mack caught cable in an actress 
 And really is the black Clark Gable of the rap biz 
 Racists reactin, hastin for action 
 The motherfucker got exquisite taste for a black man 
 What you never know? All clothes come off a hoe 
 Ever see me with my jewels and toast from off of Mo'? 
 *Psssh* Past where handsome measures 
 Like the whole entire Rat Pack, AND some precious 
 And chartable, such a big spark I pull 
 Nuns even say "That motherfucker's remarkable!" 
 And aliens who came to earth gathering 
 "Great gosh the man has soul, we must have him" 
 Like a catastrophe, there isn't none after me 
 Liz will throw away her walker and run after me 
 Snatch crowns done this, on this 
 Stunned his behind - out the way of who reign 
 I run this 
 "Hurry up, run" * cut and scratched* 
 "Run, run, run, r-run" * scratched from Run-D.M.C.* 
 "Hurry up, run" * cut and scratched* 
 [Rick] Out the way of who reign, I RUN THIS 
 "Run, r-run" "as we go" "run, r-run" 
 "Run, r-run" "as we go" "run, r-run" 
 "Run, r-run" "as we go" "run, r-run" 
 "As we go a little something like this, HIT IT!" 
 (Slick Rick) 
 Up Hastings, crew down faced and lose 
 Either one way or the other, foundation choose 
 Although the prune I kick, I didn't come to wound a sick child 
 Hit a lost world, acting like a lunatic *blblblblbl* 
 Who provoke till a heard of smoke 
 Forced good men to pull out and start to murder folk 
 Tired of the basement placed in 
 Take responsibility for your action as a race then 
 Instead of put cheer in our bone, paperhood promote 
 Negativity, and fear in our own neighbourhood 
 Since royalty breed to be (uh-huh) 
 And I puts small seed where small seed need to be 
 Like an angel tend to fly as, mention I as 
 I didn't make the laws, but they make sense to my ass 
 While waitin for the world end, won this 
 Stunned his behind - out the way of who reign 
 I run this 
 [Rick] See what I mean kid? 
 "Hurry up, run" * cut and scratched* 
 [Rick] That patch-eyed motherfucker RUN THIS 
 "Run, run, run, r-run" * scratched from Run-D.M.C.* 
 "Hurry up, run" * cut and scratched* 
 [Rick] I RUN THIS 
 "Run, r-run" "run, r-run" 
 "Run, r-run" "run, r-run" 
 "Run, r-run" "run, r-run" 
 Are, you, ready?? "run" 
 [Rick] RUN THISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS 
 "Hurry up, run" * cut and scratched* 
 "Run, run, run, r-run" * scratched from Run-D.M.C.* 
 "Hurry up, run" * cut and scratched*
