Hey, how ya doin'? Sorry you can't get through 
 Why don't you leave your name and your number? 
 I will get back to you (ooh) 
 Ain't got no time for what you think can be described as love 
 I've cut your hold on me, you're missing me, I've had enough 
 It's been so long since you have treated me like I deserved 
 So long, baby, I'm gone 
 You can leave a message for me after the tone 
 You called, I missed it 
 You called, I missed it, 
 You called, and I missed it, 
 Never get back in, tired of listenin' 
 Hey, how ya doin'? Sorry you can't get through 
 Why don't you leave your name and your number? 
 I will get back to you 
 I'm through will wish the things with you and me could be so good 
 Time to wake up or no make-ups can't make me a fool 
 Too much history, now it comes down to one thing 
 So long, baby, I'm gone 
 You can leave a message for me after the tone (oh!) 
 You called, I missed it 
 You called, I missed it, 
 You called, and I missed it, 
 Never get back in, tired of listenin' 
 Hey, how ya doin'? Sorry you can't get through 
 Why don't you leave your name and your number (number)? 
 I will get back to you (will get back to you) 
 Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah 
 You called, I missed it 
 You called, I missed it 
 You called, and I missed it 
 Never get back in, tired of listenin' (no!) 
 Hey, how ya doin'? Sorry you can't get through

 Hey, how ya doin'? Sorry you can't get through (sorry you can't get through)
