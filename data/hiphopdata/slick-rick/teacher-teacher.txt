Well I've been a public figure for quite a long time 
 Known to the whole world for what (my style of rhyme) 
 But tonight let's talk about the ones who bite 
 Although they know they won't (never get it right) 
 Because they have no (class) and they have no (shame) 
 They'll bite another brother to boost their own (name) 
 Get paid correct on a one way gimmick 
 I'm happy for you lowlifes but 'member there's a limit - so say 
 Teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it 
 It looks kinda easy like there was nothing to it 
 But they don't understand that the master will be

 When I walk into a party cokesnorters laugh 
 As the girls be crazy coming for my mere autograph 
 And it seems that they aspiring my new style of rappin' 
 And brothers all around me out of vanity are snappin' 
 The girls say 'wow Rick you're so unique 
 Please tell us how you organize the words you speak' 
 But my will says chill and I go upon my way 
 'Cause class will be taught some other day - so say 
 Teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it 
 It looks kinda easy like there was nothing to it 
 But they don't understand that the ruler will be

 Well I remember one night when the world was dead quiet 
 And out of nowhere some boy starts a riot 
 He tore my clothes, I had to throw blows 
 A shotgun barrel was dead on my nose 
 I froze - it was Big Foot and the Toes 
 Yup, a bunch of small timers that be it on my shows 
 Surrounded the ruler with machetes too 
 They said um 'if you don't teach us how to rap you're through' 
 I said 'okay, now let me go, please' 
 I seen an officer - then the officer screamed 'freeze!' 
 He said 'Slick Rick you okay?' 
 I had to play it off, some girls were looking my way 
 So I smacked one in the face and told him 'I won't retire' 
 And many years from now I'll just be getting higher 
 For I am the master, set and done 
 My name is Ricky D and I'm the only one - so say 
 (...Ricky D) - (...Ricky D) 
 Now when I was a lad my style was bad 
 So I had to use what little bit of knowledge that I had 
 So I quote and I wrote till I was up to par 
 Some rhymes were (boo-hoo) and some rhymes were (hahahaa!) 
 I educate myself so I'm able to reach ya 
 Answering the call of teacher, teacher 
 Tell us how you do it, it's so easy for me 
 The creator of the style, emcee Ricky D 
 Now my only task is to warn all biters 
 Slimy sluts and fake rhyme writers 
 Don't try your luck and get the ruler annoyed 
 For when I'm through with you boy your whole world will be destroyed 
 So chill mister muscle or I'll come and hunt ya 
 If you are a girl I'll make no man want ya 
 So if you wanna rule and no bribes in the way 
 Pay attention to my syllables and come see me and say hey hey 
 Teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it 
 It looks so easy like there was nothing to it 
 But they don't understand the ruler will be 
 The creator of the style (Ricky D) 
 Teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it
