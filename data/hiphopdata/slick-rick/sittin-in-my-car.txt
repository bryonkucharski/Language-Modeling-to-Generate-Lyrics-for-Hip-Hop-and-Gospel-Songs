(Singing) 
 Something tells Rick he's a fool 
 To let girls treat me so cruel 
 But never-the-less, Rick said "You got me waiting" 
 Sitting in my car, waiting for yoooooooooou-ooh-ooh, lalalala 
 I got a girl, but I'm about to switch all that 
 Because my girl be trying to play me like the bitch all that 
 Shoot, clocked her daughter, for acting out of order 
 To impress a girl who to me knocked her out the water! 
 But because the kid swears love 
 Though when I see her friend it's like the shit wears off 
 I don't bother, while she want to kiss and then cuss and full of hate 
 Get her friend? Mission Impossible 
 Because she's the one the hon chose to boast to 
 The way that her and the bitch is so close to be a waste 
 So make music in my basement 
 Don't cut her off till I find a good replacement 
 One day I jumped in my Jeep, drove her to her friend's 
 House, cause the hon was sleeping over 
 My girl was acting fine, then the slime switched 
 Wanna diss, I said "It's over you waste of time BITCH" 
 Tried to kiss her friend, twice then a third 
 She said "Stop, Rick", but didn't tell her friend a word 
 I went to bed, here come my girl touching me intently 
 Snuck out early, girlfriend wasn't acting as friendly as before 
 Because she swore a nigga hit her 
 "Well if you ain't love her why'd you go back to bed with her?" 
 But I didn't, now the hon badgering 
 I don't know, maybe it's me, maybe I'm imagining the love affair 
 (Singing) 
 Got Rick sitting right here 
 Waiting for you my dear 
 Wondering if you're ever gonna show, you hoe 
 Another brother out for one thing, mistook him for 
 Steady relationship is what I'm really looking for 
 Sincerity, scoop the hon I done it 
 I said "Being straight up, it's you I really wanted" 
 Though she fucked niggas with money like MAD 
 I still found myself wanting the honey quite bad 
 Loyal to her friend, though she wanted wood 
 Then we did it, boy that pussy was good 
 "But what if shorty finds out?" 
 Never be too clever 
 "Rick, she has to know if we're to ever be together" 
 Chill, then we started to button the strap and 
 Then my girl woke up, we acted like ain't nothing happened 
 Later on, my girlfriend stormed in 
 "We going to the supper club, some kid's performing 
 Bye, see you later", 
 Her girlfriend hot, then stopped living, Rick decide to follow 
 I'm outside of the club sipping a beer through the best can 
 Both sluts were sliding numbers to the next man 
 Contradicting of words being together 
 My girl, too, I should've known, birds of a feather 
 Back in my Jeep, about 4:11 
 Popped another can, looked up to the heavens 
 I'm a good man, in fact I know that I am 
 And I deserve a lady love, that's why I'm wondering why I'm... 
 (Singing) 
 Sitting in my car, waiting for yoooooooooou-ooh-ooh, lalalala 
 Got Rick sitting right here 
 Waiting for you my dear 
 Wondering if you're ever gonna show, you hoe 
 Something tells Rick he's a fool 
 To let girls treat me so cruel 
 But never-the-less, Rick said, you got me waiting 
 Sitting in my car, waiting for yoooooooooou-ooh-ooh, 
 Lalalala, lalalala, lalalala, lalalala 
 So you get my point son, 
 You just don't trust no bitch, you know what I'm sayin'? 
 "Okay, daddy, I understand" 
 Cause bitches ain't no good, you know what I'm sayin'? 
 "Okay, I get your point" 
 Anyway, listen to this, check it out 
 1994, as the world gets trifer, 
 I'm wondering, the fuck I need a woman in my life for? (ya know) 
 'Cause it's like a nigga whole history 
 With you hoes been nothing but misery 
 First rater, five-one stood 
 Mad coke fiend though the bitch looked good 
 Met her at the fever 
 "What's going on, stranger?" 
 And like a fool took her in and tried to change her 
 I don't who I thought I's bluffing 
 That BITCH wasn't giving up that coke for nothing 
 "Oh you trying to dis, mister bougeois nigga 
 Yet back in the day, you used to smoke coke cigarettes too, 
 That type shit you ain't admitting" 
 Because, homegirl, I grew out of it, you didn't 
 Anyway, dead out of order 
 Came in with a sheepskin her ex-lover bought her 
 Who gave you that? 
 "My ex" 
 I said "Who?" 
 Believe she had the nerve to say "You can wear it too" 
 When I found strength to depart, I do 
 Withdrew, for something brand new 
 Someone who would be true 
 Yes I should find someone who would be true 
 (Singing) 
 Cause Ricky needs a love that's true 
 Truuuuuuuuuuue, oh dear, scooby dooby doo 
 Scooby doo doo 
 Then I met Sin, 
 Sweating the viking 
 A brown skinned fox, slim just like I like them 
 "What? Sweating you? Picture that, nerd. Please" 
 Anyway, the bitch had herpes! (you know) 
 Imagine me, the fool being the spouse 
 Doctor said I couldn't catch it unless I got aroused 
 Found out snooping in her bag what she got 
 Now why you ain't tell me? You worthless slut! 
 "Because I loved you at the time and couldn't afford to" 
 You know homegirl should get the Oscar award for her lying 
 Anyway, stayed with the creep 
 One day, Sybil here, talking in her sleep 
 "Chris, wait," the bum bitch said 
 So loud till a motherfucker fell out the bed 
 Who the hell is Chris? She putting up resistance 
 Until I caught her calling the nigga long distance 
 Had the nerve to dis patch loving 
 Boy am I lucky that I didn't catch nothing 
 When I found strength to depart, I do 
 Withdrew, for something brand new 
 Someone who would be true 
 Yes I should find someone who would be true 
 (Singing) 
 Cause Ricky needs a love that's true 
 Truuuuuuuuuuue, truuuuuuuuue 
 Indeed, I need a love that's true 
 It seems I need a love that's true 
 Oh dear, scooby dooby doo 
 Oh gosh, Scooby doo doo-ooh (doo-ooh) 
 Though happy I was free 
 The need for love was still in me 
 Got to the point where the need for it was killing me 
 Then I met short here, hanging with my cousin 
 Found out later how young the bitch was and 
 Though I done hit it and she opened up a world 
 And remind me of that song "Go Away, Little Girl" 
 It had to end because the bitch weren't loyal, and spoiled 
 "That's because I had you pussy whipped royal" 
 You see the type of shit a nigga was gonna marry? 
 You see the type of attitude the BUM BITCH carry? 
 Like oil and water, impossible mixture 
 Then temper tantrums came into the picture 
 Yelling (ah), carrying on bad and cursing 
 Complete embarrassment to The Ruler as a person 
 "Gimme shorts" 
 Ruler will not permit you 
 Then she goes wild, starts breaking up my furniture 
 Flirts too, excuse me, a whore 
 Like the world's worst groupie when I brought her on tour 
 So when I found strength to depart, I do 
 Withdrew, for something brand new 
 Someone who would be true 
 Yes I should find someone who would be true 
 (Singing) 
 Cause Ricky needs a love that's true 
 Truuuuuuuuuuue, truuuuuuuuue 
 Indeed, I need a love that's true 
 It seems I need a love that's true 
 Oh dear, scooby dooby doo 
 Oh gosh, Scooby doo doo 
 Ricky needs a love that's true-hoo-hoo
