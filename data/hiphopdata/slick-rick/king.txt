One-two, one-two 
 Is there a party over here, with no guns and knives getting' in 
 Now let and best, get sweat the life threatenin' 
 Nettin' and suggestin', guest do the restin' 
 Mic test, KISS, BLS, who the best then? 
 'Cause when I appear with hoes off a chair with 
 Stare with, I'm talkin' 'bout a party over here with 
 Main wreckin', girls I'm checkin', could be naked too 
 Respect and to remember every one of y'all a second to 
 Their maxin', gonna be fraction, a fraction, attraction 
 Y'all don't wanna see action or askin' 
 Screw, 'cause you don't what the Rick'll do 
 Giggle to, well as you can see a butt wiggle too 
 Fried and spin my bride and move your hide and 
 Not another jammy on my side and 
 So cling although desire I'm thin 
 I'm wonderin', should I begin to kick ya mind or chin 
 'Cause I'm King 
 Did y'all forget who was the man? I'll stand and live kid 
 You will be bouncin' up and down 'cause I'm a grand individual 
 Shit you will fear say I'm cheer to dear, disappear, 
 To where you no where near to 
 And could never dream, run horse forever and 
 Clever trap a hooker screamin' I'm yours forever and 
 Town to town with the b-boy sounds 
 That has the Ruler Rick announce, which amounts to bounce to 
 The class and still hum the last and 
 Smash, jewelry heavy like kids from the past and 
 'Cause bodies lay about, respect you better pay about 
 Obey about, 'cause Ricky isn't sweatin' what you say about him 
 Oh I'm on the clause, silent you're younger boy 
 Rap bein' strong, 'cause see this is violence you hunger for 
 So cling those aren't I'm thin, I'm wonderin' 
 Should I begin to kick your mind or chin, 'cause I'm King 
 Like Caesar, so wanna chill ho on knees for 
 Please for, breeze, what money grow on trees for 
 Ten to play, I'm poppin' willie on the way in 
 Decay, the Rick could make a million a day and 
 Kid shot, 'cause we on the boy's heart 
 'Cause the part don't start that's killin' noise fart 'cause 
 Strive kid, go for the knife it's 
 One for the trife shit, run for your life it's 
 As I scrape ho's, graspin' to shape up 
 Clothes draped, tell me why you blastin' the tape up 
 And up high to where's your boyfriend tried to be 
 Ho's fly to Vance Wright, tearin' upside of me 
 Sewin' ya, sweat so I bone ya 
 Let nobody clone ya, and get how I own ya 
 So hoes cling, those aren't I'm thin 
 I'm wonderin' should I bring to kick ya mind or chin 
 'Cause I'm King
