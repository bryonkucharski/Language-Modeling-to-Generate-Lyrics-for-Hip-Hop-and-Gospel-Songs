Chorus: slick rick 
 Don't try to claim things I haven't earned honest, man 
 Slick rick and outkast is on this jam 
 What kid? diamond on the 2-2 grand 
 Trying to help raise all youth to man 
 Slick the ruler rick his space to slam 
 Help clean up this land 
 The reputation of this man 
 Withhold and withstand 
 Verse one: slick rick 
 Outkast and slick, the answer is in it 
 Hon you need to get your ass on the dancefloor this minute 
 We bruise stuff, knock you out shoes, socks 
 Show your ass, move your fuck out, we're mad smoove snots 
 La-di-da-di, mmmmm we like to party 
 Don't make me get money and platinumize my body 
 With bright stuff, known to earn a dyke's love 
 Blind folks be like, "somebody turned the lights off" 
 Immense rep, poppin' out a muffin 
 Make famous artists that's dead hop out a coffin 
 At the real estate, behavin type choosy 
 Want a palace with the shit beige and light blue please 
 Got the kid like watch your manners 
 Since I came out of jail, it's like the planet gone bananas 
 Lack of strength a badder fella had 
 Lady lookin' at me all stink, I had to tell her that 
 Verse two: big boi 
 Uh, I went from _player's ball_ to bulldoggin 
 From bulldoggin to bowhoggin 
 Now bowhoggin and pimpwalkin 
 That strictly fresh and street talkin' 
 And we all last like that there 
 Ruin them all up like cat hair 
 We never fall off like hat wear 
 We some of the dopest MC's out there 
 Now eat that, outkast and ricky d, bitch can you beat that? 
 Remember the time I laid them down to teenage love now see that 
 Just to sport a rhyme and break in new patterns like hymens 
 Shuckin and jivin was never the style 
 I'm gon' keep on beatin' this line 
 Spittin' that king shit, you cling shit 
 A tailor and a seamstress 
 New gators for you haters and the penis for all you beatches 
 Like an addiction 'cause I need it, hip-hop is that I be that 
 Like a junkie showin your monkey, 'cause I sho' nuff like to beat it 
 Might just eat it just to skeet it, fold you up like you was pleated 
 Like some slacks and, relaxin, be strollin like some cats then 
 I got a, baby daughter, and I feed her with this rappin' 
 Not trappin, b-boy, but rappin', huh 
 Verse three: slick rick 
 Seems everybody's open off the grammar 
 The white fox pink velvet suit, white cabana 
 Listen baby girl, genius rick ta... 
 Dreamboat wish, you shoulda been clicked picture 
 (Check her out) I don't know what you're tryin' to figure out 
 Down south, barbecue ribs fly out a nigga mouth 
 And touchin me the chosen, for such a will opposin 
 Me and big boi tryin' to give our children clothing 
 Smokin' love - do we provide dope enough? 
 Even people unborn kid wide open off 
 The enginin I'm sendin in 
 Even make construction workers start actin' kind of feminine 
 (Hi!) 10%'ll blast this hit from me and big boi 
 Who represent the outkast click 
 A jealous cat, lack of strength a badder fella had 
 Lady lookin' at me all stink, had to tell her that 
 Slick rick and outkast is on this jam... 
 Tryin' to help raise all youth to man... 
 Slick the ruler rick his space to slam... 
 The reputation of this man...
