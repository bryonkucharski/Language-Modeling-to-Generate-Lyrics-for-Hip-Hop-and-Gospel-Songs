Sang my song, stuck out my tongue, girl's strung 
 Sweatin' among 'em was a hon' 
 "Got a man but we're not gettin' along" 
 Lick the balls, I know some girls'll lick it, not a rhyme, kick it 
 "Rick it's amazin' how you rap word up, you sound wicked" 
 "Do I dig her?" Silly question picture a jerk and do I trick her 
 "If you only know how good you be lookin' to a nigga" 
 Butt perfect, to her car say would I walk her? Not ever 
 Tell her "call me later on just to talk or whatever" 
 Stirrin' it up, learn the digits, to be safe burn it up 
 "And here's another slick Rick one" and the man turn it up 
 Now on my strap and very soon she be all hot and wanna rap 
 'Sup cap'n over there but Rick ain't nothin' gonna happen 
 Comes over stuck my toungue in her mouth she gave me a hickey, shocked me 
 The way she jocked truck me, "knock me Ricky, knock me" 
 Don't affect you none you popped your kid and rocked your son 
 Though you ho's strung now didn't knock or tongue 
 'Cause it's wrong 
 Another honey real sneaky lines thrown on the freak 
 Says "money works away but he be home on the weekends" 
 "Wanted to say you're best, out-chargin' the rest though" 
 Says the guest though now massagin' the breast though 
 While I'm gettin' info out of her, girlfriend's side of her 
 Doin' this already, I'll be in that and out of her 
 Ask her friend "what poet best?" Rather not flow 
 Though know, girlfriend actin' like down to cut throat 
 "You seem too hard for the rest of them", met all, been too 
 Hint to her friend, time to leave so we can get all into 
 So then friend says "don't take all day whore I mean" 
 Drops number on the floor makes sure the dog seen it 
 Alone asks "Can you help me rap?" "Maybe"... winking 
 "Think me, you'll go far", "oh yeah that's it baby drink me" 
 Don't affect you none you popped kid and rocked your son 
 Though you ho's strung now didn't knock or tongue 
 'Cause it's wrong 
 "A good look strike ya ho" 
 "You attack mic as though" 
 "I wanted to ask you is that really real?" 
 "Witch, act like you know" 
 "Give me a line for your joint, been to every store to find you" 
 "Gettin' noisy everyone leave but you close the door behind you" 
 "Left your man dressin' room he tried to dis me 'cause you rule in school" 
 I said "word, so won't you kiss me you fool" 
 Shoulder shrug she pop "why not?" another fan above, on the luck 
 Well anyway like a autograph and a hug 
 Made my move to triple excitement 
 "Stop Rick you'll flip it" 
 As I grind against her pussy and I didn't lick her nipple 
 Less than a minute more progression look at her hide in her dress and 
 Lights off pull panties to the side and caressin' 
 Mass roll up playin' her life 
 Want to keep her in past goal 
 Bolder now she's sayin' "more deeper in my asshole" 
 Don't affect you none you popped kid done rocked your son 
 Though strung no I didn't knock or tongue 
 'Cause it's wrong
