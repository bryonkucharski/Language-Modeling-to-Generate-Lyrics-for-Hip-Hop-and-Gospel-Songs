Check this out, this Warren G, y'know what I'm saying 
 Chilling wit my man Slick Rick, you know 
 And we gonna give you all a little tale about this jail stuff 
 You know, so Rick, why don't you run it homie, yeah 
 (Slick Rick) 
 In the slammer kid but I'm innocent 
 Lord played witty wasn't having any pity 
 Now wit razor blades, did he 
 Cry suppose the situation seen mad eyes of foes 
 Drives a Rolls, hey, yo, money, what size are those 
 Need to phone me toanothe sprang up, hm, to gang up 
 On the skid, housing the phone like he didn't know how to hang up 
 Would be hard though ought a minute or so and then yells time on a 
 And when you get your commisary, buy this and that or else I'm gonna 
 Be on that ass and won't stay off, extort, fig I say, way off 
 Beaten death, you ain't protecting me, forgot today's my day off 
 Hold my head and drift the ?Sumo weighing nuts and cars? 
 Instead of sitting here accumulating cuts and scars, behind bars 
 Dum ditty dum ditty ditty datty day 
 This type of shit happens every day 
 Take some punk locked up to get beat down, ripped down to his boots is broke 
 Down 
 Dum ditty dum ditty ditty datty day 
 This type of shit happens every day 
 Riots, malay and disturbances of the peace 
 (Warren G) 
 Mister Slick Rick let me take it for a second 
 And tell a short tale about the LA county jail 
 9500 that was the lock up 
 When the lights got dim, it was time for the soccer 
 Jacking for the money, backstab was my mission 
 If a riot jumped out, it's time for incision 
 Sticking niggas here and sticking niggas there 
 I turn around and look and seen cops everywhere 
 Jacking brothers up, slapping brothers up 
 If you got blood on your clothes, lock up 
 High powered was the level, level fo' 
 Niggas sentenced to life and you can't be no ho (bitch) 
 Or you can't tooken wit homies overlooken 
 As safe next door wit the Puma straight cooking 
 Lighten up the whole module, hm 
 Godamn, yeah, anothe squabble 
 (Slick Rick) 
 Showing off 'cause on the phone, click, losing all the hoes off 
 Nigga housed the watch and ?donna? took all of the clothes off 
 Nigga hell with the was for my clothes figured telling 
 Every night it seem like mice be in and out a nigga cell and 
 Still ain't home, like on the hook, seen a bunch of kids look 
 Miss outdoors, never know what you have until it's tooken 
 And in fact, the moment you fear, all of that, you quote snaps 
 Well in a cell, did the exercises and wrote raps 
 I be a bigger star than you, no never heard of the nigga 
 Takes my raps and read aloud, I want to murder the migga 
 Just kidding, no offend to it, finally he ended it 
 Case dismissed, but your honor, DA kindly prevented it 
 He told to the judge, don't free him, this brother trigger wars 
 And not just that because I refuse to wash some jive nigga doors 
 So hold the head, drift the ?sunot weight and nuts and cars? 
 Instead of sitting here accumulating cuts and scars 
 Behind bars 
 One fight, the nigga trip, seal the rest he might scared 
 By couldn't squeal, I's like officer that nigga right there 
 Now if he ain't get me his friends will, needed a utensil 
 It turn out, I had to stab him in the eye wit a pencil 
 State of shock, he made a yell, I said, now what you want traitor 
 CO puts me in the bin, I see ya about a month later 
 Back in population, didn't matter that his friends tensed 
 The phone prints, the years added to the sentence 
 Still chilling and all of that and I escaped 
 When the damn thing sold, don't hit the sto' 'cause they made a rape attempt 
 Thank goodness, failed, call out next, he wail out 
 Here go the CO, Ricky Walters, back up, bailed out 
 The Co couldn't see the rape, the kid'll snithc mass figure 
 Fast trigger, you'll be back, you little bitch ass nigga 
 Au vare, back to dating sluts and stars 
 At least for now, no more accumulating cuts and scars 
 Behind bars
