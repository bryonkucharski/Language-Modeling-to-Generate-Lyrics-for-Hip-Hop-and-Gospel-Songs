Hauk, who goes yonder? 
 It is I, sire, Richard of Nottingham 
 Well, speak up man, what is it? 
 News from the east, sire, Rick the Ruler has returned! 
 Gather 'round party goers as if your still livin' 
 And get on down to the old Slick rhythm 
 Now this one here is called the Ruler my dear 
 It's a mere party booster that will set things clear 
 It's a hundred percent proof from champions of truth 
 And if you feel you need spirit I'll bring back your youth 
 Relax your mind, and folks unwind 
 And be kind to a rhythm that you hardly find 
 And off we go, let the trumpets blow 
 Well hold on, because the driver of the mission is a pro 
 The Ruler's back 
 Now in these times, at least to me 
 There's a lot of people out here tryin' to sound like Ricky D 
 Not tryin' to cause trouble cause its really a small thing 
 But they're bitin what I'm writin 
 God it's great being the king 
 Some sound all right, but then they act illy 
 Try conquering my crown and that's really very silly 
 Now I'm not the type that gets upset 
 Try to disrespect folks just to earn respect 
 But learn this fact, whether white or black 
 I can't be conquered in my style of rap 
 For jealousy and envy are dumb ones tools 
 So Ricky says nothing, he keeps his cool 
 Revenge is not a mission that the Ruler's on 
 Just forgiveness required for the wrong that's done 
 So off we go, let the trumpets blow 
 And hold on, because the driver of the mission is a pro 
 The Ruler's back 
 Now one day when I was chillin' at this outside jam 
 I seen folks havin' a ball and plus clappin' their hands 
 To beats of records that conquer the streets 
 Like Pee Wee Herman and Clubhouse Treats 
 Girls was chillin', boys rule as usual 
 The slacks, the golds, the rings, I hope I'm not confusin y'all 
 But everyone in the house looks smashin' 
 Fresh clothes on their butts and nothing out of fashion 
 And just when you thought nothing couldn't get better 
 A news flash concealed in a bright yellow letter 
 A kid ran up to the mike and said "Alert, hear this," 
 Cleared his cloggy throat and then began to persist 
 He said "Hallelujah, kids hear this 
 The Ruler's back and he's here to assist" 
 So off we go, let the trumpets blow 
 And hold on because the driver of the mission is a pro 
 The Ruler's back
