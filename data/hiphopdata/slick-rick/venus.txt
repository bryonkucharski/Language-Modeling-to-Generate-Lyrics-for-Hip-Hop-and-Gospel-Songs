Just gettin' off my job, 'round Wall Street, with the ties on 
 Finest girl, a brother think he ever set eyes on 
 Nice day, weather sunny, as he made a run for honey 
 With a warm personality, well it's on the money 
 I'd have tongued her right there, seemed kinda fun up there 
 Wonderin' there, as he tellin' me he could get the underwear 
 Meanwhile, still jockin' her, like a real sucka 
 Sister which was so fine, she could have AIDS, I'll still knock her 
 Heart beatin' for her since a brother didn't figure meetin' 
 As I ask her if she's single, "yeah, caught my nigga cheatin'" 
 "Nice to meet ya". Leaves, she had dope combined features 
 Watched her walk away and observin' the fine creature 
 Next day again, went in uninvite[d], super angry with us 
 Ran into to so much that her and her friends had start to hang with us 
 They pair and move, though fine, they both swine 
 "Can I take you out to movies wine, dine, the whole nine?" 
 She condones, good riddance, nigga slid this on her 
 Didn't want to get to bone her, though I knew I didn't own her 
 And I could've made a move, a little will power 'cause although 
 That she told me she liked him as a friend and that was all 
 And since hang with us, she already told her, cool he freaked her 
 The week on my birthday bought me a pair of Gucci sneakers 
 "Did she like me?" Racin' the thought. "Was it a sign?" Guess it weren't immoral 
 When she saw me, definitely this is kinda special 
 Since for this dish, none abate, but everybody wanna play 
 "How long is money gonna wait?" So I asked a honey on a date 
 And she accepts, though thought it wasn't much [of] a plan 
 Windows of the world, even had the nerve to touch her hand 
 Though not lookin' at. Bashful? No sir 
 Supposed I was so shy and then the hon' pulls closer 
 Thought "clever hint", so what she straight, never been so excited 
 And convinced, kiss in heaven ever since 
 Holdin' her hand too, chillin', future plan to build 
 Couldn't believe my dream fulfilled and then that girl began to ill by sayin' 
 Lady if you will 
 Say you're the one that sent for me to thrill 
 Someone that I can hold close in my arms 
 With all the charms of you 
 All the charms of you 
 Of a lady, this world is just for ladies 
 A heart screams out to ladies 
 A world of love's for you
