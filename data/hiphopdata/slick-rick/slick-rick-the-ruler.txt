 Forget about the people before I know tired of 
 Been through the whole world for what? Tired of bride 
 But tonight let's talk about the ones who bite 
 Although they know, they won't ever get it right

 And can't find another brother who boost it on pain

 Walk into a party, come smart and laugh 
 As the girls go crazy, want me for my dear autograph 
 And it's me they be admirin, my new style of rappin' 
 And brothers go around me, how I done the insanity 
 The girls say "wow" they can't spell the hate 
 Say fellas how you organize the word's today 
 On my will says "chill" and I do it by my way 
 'Cause that's how we port son, represent, represent

 Remember one night when the world was dead quiet 
 And outta nowhere some boys start a riot 
 Take off my clothes, I had to throw blows 
 The shotgun barrel and dead on my toes 
 The pros, it was people and the knows 
 Had a bunch of small timers, the people on my show 
 Surround it and bring it wit my empty shift 
 And said um, will you teach us how to rap, no doubt
