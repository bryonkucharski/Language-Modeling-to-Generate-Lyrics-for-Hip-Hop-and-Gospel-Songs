 I'm a live nigga, standin' out like a rash 
 A live nigga, keep cash in a stash 
 What's the eggs without the corn beef hash? 
 Blowin' up like Sarah Dash 
 Jerkin' up the neck, known to cause whiplash 
 Dance and get down with me 
 Peep the steelo, the strategy 
 What killed the cat's curiosity? 
 You better believe that I be freakin' 
 Pull my ass if the M4 leakin' 
 Same MC who wreck shop at the beacon 
 Uptown lingo is what I'm speakin' 
 So put your pedal to the metal 
 And feet to the ground and peep this uptown sound 
 Makes no sense just standin' around 
 Hey, it makes no sense just standin' around

 I'm chillin' with nice and smooth with my phat farm outfit 
 They say what's up Rick what's up good to see you out kid 
 Where the party at, askin' and relaxin' 
 And pop a couple of Moe's listenin' to some fat tracks with them 
 Being a kid was locked, want to check the the scene and shit 
 Zulu nation havin' somethin' tonight at the Arena Greg 
 Let's get drunk and roll, said they like the sound of it 
 Rolled a couple of blunts, but ruler wasn't down with it 
 Fans did some plead to go and hit somethin' 
 Be off work release even if you get caught with weed in yo system 
 Be up north quick, since we all down to roll 
 Went to the club havin' the up most amount of fun 
 Should've heard them groupies scream for 
 Wonder why this brother lookin' at me all mean for 
 Ignored it, kept wappin' till my neck hurt 
 Then Greg Nice and smooth did this very same record called 
 It makes no sense just standin' around

 Happy birthday, what's the word say 
 To papa smurf, I cover the globe like earth day 
 Rollin' with G and the Rickster 
 Flavor full boogie down mixture 
 We came back to attack with the ruler 
 You can't get no cooler on our way to the bank 
 Now do the Patty Duke and then do the Spank 
 Come from the heart things spark 
 And keep your eyes glued to the top of the chart 
 Oh shit, it's the man with the fronts and the jewels 
 The kids with the blunts and the tools 
 Sewing up shop like needles 
 Sellin' more record than The Beetles 
 So don't be astound 
 And makes no sense in standin' around 
 It makes no sense just standin' around
