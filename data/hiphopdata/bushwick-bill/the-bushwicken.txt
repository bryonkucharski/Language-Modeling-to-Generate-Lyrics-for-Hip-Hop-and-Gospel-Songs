Hello? Is anybody out there? Can you hear me? 
 It's about to happen 
 Dr. Wolfgang Von Bushwicken the Bavarian Bill 
 (Watch me] [Kill) 
 Straight outta nightmares, somewhere 
 A rare glimpse of Bushwick 
 I'm off on some sick shit 
 My mind still plays tricks 
 It is I says me, I agree with my inner self 
 Thinkin' and contemplate on all the pain that my enemies felt 
 At the hands of this madman 
 Catscans can't prove that I'm crazy 
 I wanna chop bodies daily 
 Oh God save me, Dahmer was a minor case 
 Get a load of Chuckwick 
 Eye to eye, face to face 
 Evil thoughts hit me when I get distraught 
 Easily hidden, I'm never gettin' fuckin' caught fool 
 Lucky Chuckie 
 Trust me in your house and watch 
 You'll go into shock, chokin' on your blood clot 
 Don't mind me

 Haha, horrifyin', part of me's a big man 
 I went to Cypress Hill they learned how to kill a man

 I got dead bodies rottin' in my Benz trunk 
 Trunk of funk, call it what you want to 
 Make sure I'm gone, and not behind you 
 Because in dreams, I'm breemin' Scotty dead bodies 
 Don't try to run, you can't escape this (????) dread 
 Yes I'm dead, and always stay a step ahead 
 And if I stay behind your ass is mines anyway 
 Play it wit shark, I like to kick body parts 
 It's an art, to choppin' up hearts kid 
 Did what I did because I know in this mind I'm sick 
 And you just try to survive a visit from the
