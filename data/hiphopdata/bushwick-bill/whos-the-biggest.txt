There was three little piggies and they all went to the market 
 And two short motherfuckas, hahaha 
 Chopped them down, because, uh 
 One little short motherfucka was born into greatness 
 Has obtained greatness, because his name is uh 
 Bushwick, aka Chuck, four foot eight and straight don't give a fuck 
 I got the strength of six men 
 With the heart to run up on a muthafucka six ten 
 I swear, I knows no fear, this labels me a threat 
 Throats get cut, niggas chests get wet 
 Some people say I got a short complex, that ain't true 
 But I got a short fuse so what's next? 
 Now we could go toe to toe or shoulder to nut 
 Either way it goes your getting fucked 
 Cause you trip and try to size me 
 And that type of shit just inspires me 
 I don't need no muthafuckin strap 
 We could get it on 'cause I feel I got a (?????) 
 Now you could fuck me up and I'ma still squab 
 Peelin' more caps than the motherfuckin mob 
 Who the biggest, little motherfucker you know? 
 You the biggest, little motherfucka I know 
 I'm the biggest, little motherfucka you know 
 You the biggest, little motherfucker I know 
 Some hoe nigga tried to play me out the box 
 (Now what you do that for?) 
 Now I got to knock your ass out 
 With the one, two jump to the chin 
 I'll wake your ass up and then knock your ass out again 
 That's what you get for tryin' to test the Chuck black 
 A back full of dirt and my foot in your ass trick 
 I can't stand a muthafucka fulla talk 
 You pull his hoe cord and he can't walk the walk 
 Don't let your eyes get bigger than your squabble 
 Thinkin' 'cause I'm small nigga, you can make me wobble 
 I got a punch as big as Streisands nose 
 Running motherfuckas like some panty hose 
 Shit, it takes two to tango 
 But one to get his ass kicked 
 Now I can get in that ass trick 
 Hitting motherfuckas up, Houston style 
 5th Ward motherfucker how you like me now? 
 Now I'm eeny meeny miny fuckin' mo 
 It seems nobody wants to fuck wit Chuck NO MOE! 
 Ever since I put the weight down 
 Ever sonce I broke a niggas jaw 
 Don't nobody wanna play now 
 First it was all good, and you were smilin' 
 Until I broke your two front teeth, and now your whinin 
 I told you motherfuckas size ain't shit 
 I only wear size 5's but I still kick dents 
 You talk shit and I'ma beat that ass 
 You come weak and I'ma beat that ass 
 You play me cheap and I'ma beat that ass 
 And if cheatin' bring ya heat then I'ma heat that ass trick 
 Don't ever underestimate a nigga with a giant size heart 
 And king size trigga finger 
 And don't ever fuck wit Wick 
 'Cause I'm the biggest little motherfucka you know trick
