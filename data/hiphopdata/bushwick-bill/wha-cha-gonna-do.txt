And ah... the secret of the hidden temple is that ah 
 You gotta listen, as I run it down the business 
 The jungle creed, is that the strongest feeds, on any prey it can 
 And I was branded beast, at every feast, before I became a man 
 Hahaha! Full swing for the jungle. 
 John Bido in the house, it's a black man thing you wouldn't 
 Understand. 
 What cha gonna do when the world's on fire? 
 I'ma light a spliff, and keep gettin' higher 
 The world's bout to end 
 I don't give a fuck 
 I ain't scared to die, niggaz put that on Chuck 
 Verse One: 
 Put me in a room with four gats and four clips 
 Aimed at my dome and I bet I won't flinch 
 At least I get to know I'm going out in a blast 
 So either pull the trigger or you tricks better mash 
 'Cause I ain't afraid to kill neither 
 I snatch your soul like the motherfuckin grim reaper 
 I be the, man that worries not about life 
 I'd rather piss in the wind than take a risk with eyes, yeah 
 A brave man dies once, but a coward dies a thousand deaths 
 Fuck a right, I make a thousand lefts 
 'Cause I'm a motherfuckin thrillseeker 
 You can't scare me with no bullshit threats, I ain't afraid to die 
 Verse Two: 
 The world is on some old new-improved shit 
 They building bombs everyday but screaming peace 
 A piece of pussy nowaday could cost a nigga life 
 The condom ain't shit, the rubber breaks and that's your life 
 Babies havin' babies knowin' not what to do 
 For some grown ass men, niggaz old as me and you 
 Think a nigga fuck a kid needs his motherfuckin dick chopped off 
 Cause youse a child molester, that ain't cool motherfucker 
 Mamas keeping sons from their daddies 
 What you sposed to teach him bitch? You ain't no man, youse a hoe 
 Monkey see, monkey do 
 What you want my son to act like me or act like you, shit 
 I'm on the verge of suicide, so what's murder? 
 Another casuality, cause mentally I'm damaged G 
 So I ain't afraid, I ain't afraid to kill 
 And I ain't afraid to die, motherfucker 
 Verse Three: 
 A punk can be controlled by death threats 
 A man's not a man if he can't take a stand and umm 
 Confront your foes nigga everybody bleeds 
 So fuck bowing down to another nigga's needs 
 Curiousity, killed the cat 
 And anybody gettin' curious with mines is gettin' disciplined black 
 I lets the motherfuckin fo'-fo' click 
 And that's the end of that big bad nigga shit (see-ya!) 
 How can you be afraid of what's bound to happen 
 You can't run and try to hide from death 
 Death is univited, it's also at a shitty time 
 Things can creep and snatch your ass up out your prime, I lives my 
 Life 
 Aggressively, successfully, I press to be 
 Demanding with myself and not profess to be 
 You can't impress me with no bullshit threats 
 I squabble any motherfucker out your set, motherfucker
