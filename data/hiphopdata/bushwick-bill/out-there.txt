The car broke down and she was like "Honey, get the flash light" 
 Still one in the dash right? 
 Only 'cause it's late at night 
 And who knows 
 What's out there 
 She was right tho 
 Ain't gonna help with a light tho 
 People dying tonight 
 Cause yo this maniac is, out there 
 I'm hanging like a possum 
 Murder tricks, I got some 
 Spot them 
 Look come around to the bottom 
 And slaughter them, out there 
 His boo was locked up in the car 
 On the phone and tripping hard 
 Screaming 
 Fuck that bitch was scurred 
 There's a killer out there 
 Cut that crying shit off 
 I cut 
 You die 
 I get off 
 I'm crawling up on the car 
 Trying to rip the moon roof lid off, out there 
 Bitch turned the wipers on 
 Hazard lights and blew the horn 
 I smashed with my axe, and pulled her to the lawn, out there 
 She kicked me hard, to the grill 
 With one of them, Doc Martin heels 
 Murderas, you know how that feels 
 Your lip be out there 
 Time to die 
 Close my eyes 
 Swung and felt a thump 
 I done spilt her head in half like a tree stump, out there 
 Don't you dare go out there, ain't no telling what lies out there 
 Don't you dare go out there, ain't no telling what can happen 
 Don't you dare go out there, ain't no telling what lies out there 
 Don't you dare go out there, late night killas might be stabbing 
 Lights on in the house 
 But it's dark outside 
 You can even close one eye 
 Look bitch, I'm out there 
 Camp fire lit 
 Boy Scout meeting's they talk of me 
 Even they leaders got memories of me, I'm out there 
 Forensic scientists try to finger me out 
 But I'm too quick for their Sheriff's stupid asses 
 I'm still out there 
 Pull up all your road blocks 
 I'm running them them's in my socks 
 Silently taken out all cops, one by one, I'm out there 
 Leave they bodies 
 In the street 
 Continue on my murder spree 
 They can believe all my heat 
 When I pull it out there 
 Break up into the Zoo 
 Dress up in a monkey suit 
 Sticking up families for they loot, my brain, is out there 
 Handy with an ice pick 
 Pull it out and use it good 
 In and out your temple 
 Blood is squirting all out there 
 I'm the urban legend you heard at your college dorm 
 Jump out and squeeze your vocal cords 
 When you out there 
 Some where out there a remnance of Bushwick 
 My mind loads clips at your block 
 And leave you stuck bitch 
 A psychopath 
 With a clasp and a black ski mask 
 Leave you in body bags 
 For a news flash 
 I might be small 
 But I got big balls 
 Write my name on the wall 
 With bloodstains after the brawl 
 Evil thoughts run deep in my brain 
 I'm sick and deranged 
 So picture the pain 
 Flowing in my veins 
 Yeah I'm sick 
 I'm sicker then Hitler 
 My gat spit streak mothafucking forbidden scriptures 
 Niggas run from a gun, forgetting they can't 
 I drag a Mossberg, cause it won't fit in my pants 
 I run up in your ride, it's parked and 
 It's darken 
 Jump out your glove compartment, sparking 
 The shit that I do, make many faint 
 Dead saint 
 Turn your blood into candy paint
