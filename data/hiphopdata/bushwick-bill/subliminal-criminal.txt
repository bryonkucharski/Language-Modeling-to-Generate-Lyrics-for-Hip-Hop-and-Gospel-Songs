(Feat. Sherm) 
 Doctor Wolfgang I heard you was a mastermind of crimes baby 
 And I'd like you to break it down for me 
 And have a nigga know about the criminal aspects 
 And it's subliminal criminal aspect of a brother's life and all that ... 
 Man, nigga you need to get in, get out and get something 
 (I need some of that muthafunkin dollarbill) 
 Nigga what, ain't nobody given me no handouts (break it down for me) 
 Yeah I'ma tell you how it goes 
 (Verse 1: Bushwick Bill) 
 It ain't your average crime, it fits one of mines 
 I tried to warn 'em at first but I've got to prove it this time 
 They call me Chuck Wick, the 5th ward, hard crippler 
 Niggas think I'm the devil, bitches hail me like Hitler 
 But still, I'm real with these skills that I've mastered 
 Peelin your caps backwards so I've never been captured 
 So I'm physically and mentally relentless 
 I live for the killing, and Chuckie's my accomplice 
 And me, I'm a psycho coma 
 Killer with the skills, releasin these tales of drama 
 That fuck around and sell a million copies still 
 Motherfucking coppers wanna watch me chill 
 That lets me know I'm on they brain 
 So they're never out my range, 'cause I'm shootin like Danny Ainge 
 Dumpin two clips minimal, now I'm at your funeral 
 Should've never fucked with the subliminal criminal 
 It's the subliminal criminals at the door 
 The enemies didn't know they had a loaded 4-4 
 And he's cockin his Glock, each one is gon' drop 
 (And your wicked) just can't be stopped 
 (Verse 2: Sherm) 
 Well it's Sherm, who dat comin' up to the bath, as I rat-tat-tat-tat 
 Grab yo gat and watch your fucking back 
 This ain't no ho-gang, bitch, it's on the real 
 So you best to be packin your steel, or you bitch be getting killed 
 Jackings and robberies ain't nothin' but hobbies 
 So you best to check your vest and don't be rollin' by me sloppy 
 'Cause I'ma jack you, fool I'ma get you 
 9 millimeter spray hit you bitch and let ya split ya 
 So knuckle down or motherfucker knuckle up 
 'Bout to get fucked all that Chucks 
 So don't push your motherfucking luck 
 357, 9 millimeter, or the Tec-9 shine 
 If I see bitch-made pulling next to me I can be goin' for mine 
 Old-school motherfucker, but I'm only 18 
 Steppin hard for the scene, in '95 you gon' see what I mean 
 Fillin up the hospital, stressin out my mental 
 So say what's up to a subliminal criminal 
 Dr. Wolfgang Von Buschwicken The Barbarian Mother-funky Stay High Dollar Billstir 
 Is gonna break down what makes up a subliminal criminal 
 And why it's a white-collar crime 
 ["Subliminal":] below the threshold of conscious perception 
 Inadequate to produce conscious awareness 
 ["Criminal":] of evolvin or havin' the nature of a person 
 Who has committed or being legally convicted guilty of a crime 
 It is shameful and disgraceful that you don't know what time it is
