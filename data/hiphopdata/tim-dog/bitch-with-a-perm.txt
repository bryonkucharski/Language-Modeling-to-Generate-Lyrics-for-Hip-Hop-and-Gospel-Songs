With so many Gs in the industry 
 I'm being sweated by this smut and his name is Snoopy 
 But huh, somehow, someway 
 He keep biting Smooth B and Slick Rick style every single day 
 May... I... dis you for a while? 
 Hey... punk... you know that's really not your style 
 I'm trying to figure something out 
 Why you live with your mama while my pad is free 
 You can come to my crib and lick my (ping) 
 Ride on my wood till I bust a (ping) 
 Huh, so whatcha gonna do? 
 Black, you ain't got what Dr.Dre boy you can't do jack 
 So close the door and turn off the light 
 'Cause you'll be pumping my hits all night 
 So don't you ever try to dis 
 Tim Dog's on the set, so sucker, bounce to this! 
 (Bitch with a perm, bitch with a perm 
 I don't give a (scratch) about a bitch with a perm) 
 (X4) 
 I'm sitting in my crib watching MTV 
 When this skinny punk rapper on the telly try to dis me 
 He tried to flex on the D-O-G 
 But if I gave the punk binoculars he still couldn't see me 
 So shake your bones and your rattle 
 And leave your toy 9 at home and bring your skills to the battle 
 Like Jeru, I'm gonna damage 
 I'm starving for success and you'll get eaten like a Burgerking sandwich 
 It's a pity fake suckers gotta show off 
 I'll bust your skinny head with a sawed off 
 I heard your mother was a dope fan (Hit me) 
 I heard your father was a dick fan (Sssht) 
 And when your (ping) was locked up in the county jail 
 I heard you pressed up Lee Jeans (Sssht) 
 So step back from the lyrical maniac, I'm ripping your track 
 And as a fact, I can never be whack 
 And if you think you're hard, push your luck around 
 Dog is the man who can buck you down! 
 (CHORUS) Yeah, it's like that 
 I'm the original hardcore lyric ballbreaker 
 When it comes to whack MCs no I'm not a funk faker 
 I smash, I crash, and put you in the trash 
 And give you new rhymes like you never learned in class 
 I'm a real MC and I'm on my own 
 And if nobody got my back, I can hold my own 
 If I die, I die, if I live then I live 
 But if Hip-Hop survive, I got something I can give 
 I don't care if you don't think I can win 
 And I don't care if you don't wanna be my friend 
 And if the Pound get mad and they want some beef 
 Yo, I don't want it 'cause I'm a vegeterian 
 (CHORUS) It's like that, yeah 
 Yeah, kid, this business ain't big enough for two dogs 
 So let the battle begin 
 Haha, but you don't want it 
 'Cause I'll end ya career 
 You bit ya style from Slick Rick 
 You sound like Smooth B 
 And ya try to bite the name from the D-O-G 
 But I'm the real, haha 
 The real, so let the battle begin
