Step to me if you're ready for a beatdown 
 Swift wit my hands, I don't fuck around 
 I'm laying out MC's in a sec 
 I'll get wreck and break your muthafucking neck 
 Who can step to me from Compton 
 None them rappers 'cause I'm still stomping 
 So bail in your best MC's 
 Nigga, please 
 I'll wax you, tax you, I'll just fax you 
 Put in ?(sominian)? pumps to cold mack you 
 You think your rhymes are so fine 
 I'm rolling through Compton wit a tech nine 
 Eazy, you're sloppy, Dre you know you're played 
 Ren, You're cool but your rhymes don't lay 
 Against the D-O-G 
 The only dope rapper you had was I-C-E 
 But you tried to jerk him like a sucker 
 That's why he's larger than you dumb muthafuckas 
 And if there was a repercussion, there was no discussion 
 So the shit ain't nutting 
 And if you think you can fuck wit the D-O-G 
 Ha-ha, step to me 
 Step to me... 
 Watch me slip (niggaz chant) 
 You better have fear 
 Somebody should've told ya the Dog is near 
 I'm wiping that ass like tissue 
 Best believe the Dog's gonna dis you 
 Rip you up, tip you up, cold bust your lips up 
 Now shut the fuck up 
 Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down 
 You know you can't fuck around wit the Jim Brown 
 Running MC's like a quarterback 
 Brothers are wack, I want my muthafucking money back 
 All those tracks you made 
 Fuck your grade 'cause your shit is played 
 Dis me, why bother 
 Stepping to me, you rather step to your father 
 Yeah, and I'm all that 
 And NWA is crazy wack 
 Peace to Ice Cube, peace to Ice-T 
 DJ Quik, you can suck my dick 
 Then want to wax that ass 
 And send you back to hardcore class 
 And if you think you can fuck wit the D-O-G 
 Bring it on, step to me 
 Step to me... 
 Step to a man wit the clan at hand 
 Ina masterplan, shit, Godam 
 Lethal weapon, rhymes are def and 
 Tim Dog's a man, you shouldn't a been sleeping on 
 I carry on wit the song, you're right, I'm dog-gone 
 Word is born 
 I'll compare and dare wit a stare 
 Your sayind where, I'm over here 
 Rap bull, a guerilla warfare 
 Dis my crew, don't you dare 
 Girls jock me, crowds clock me 
 While rap artists peer's cock block me 
 But if there a rapper that think that he's better than me 
 Bring it on, step to me 
 Step to me...
