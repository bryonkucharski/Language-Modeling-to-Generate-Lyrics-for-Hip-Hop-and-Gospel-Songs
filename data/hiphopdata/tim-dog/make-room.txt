(Ring) 
 (Ooh God this is gonna be good) 
 (Hello) 
 (Wake up) 
 Yeah! Hahaha! 
 (Wake the fuck up, baby, this is WS... We don't give a fuck) 
 Make room, muthaphukka, make room (4x) 
 Make room for the muthaphukkin psychopath 
 Breakin rappers in half that don't know the math 
 Step to me if you're ready 
 You get chopped with a muthaphukkin machette 
 'Cause I don't give a fuck about you, 
 Your record company and your goddamn crew 
 All you pussies keep fakin the funk 
 Talkin' much shit when you're nothin' but a punk 
 But the Dog is back 
 To rip a fat track, 'cause I'm a black Mac 
 I'm your fuckin' nightmare 
 You better beware 'cause the Dog is here 
 I'll wax anybody 
 Bring it on, bring it on, I'm ready to party 
 Whatever you wanna do 
 You wanna roll with the guns, I got shit too 
 But ya better wear a bullet-proof vest 
 'Cause when I shoot to kill ain't nobody left 
 "Shoot to kill" is my motto 
 Fuckin' with death you should have gone and played lotto 
 Everybody thought you was crazy 
 Look at'cha now, you're fuckin' pushin up daisies 
 So everybody know the name of the muthaphukkin man that's insane... 
 Make room, muthaphukka, make room (19x) 
 Make room, muthaphukka, yeah
