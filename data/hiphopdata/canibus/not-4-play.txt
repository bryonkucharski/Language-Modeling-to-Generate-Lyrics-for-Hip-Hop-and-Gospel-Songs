(Chorus: Kurupt and Canibus) 
 Don't play them games, not for play, not today 
 Say what you say, not for play, not to day 
 We horseman man, you fools insane, locked the game 
 We spit flames, not for play, not today 
 (Kurupt) 
 Each day I dip sometimes I trip 
 This gangsta shit (west gangsta shit) 
 I just don't give a fuck 
 I gallop role I'm in control 
 I like gettin' high in G mode 
 With the homeys just lettin all the weed blow 
 Fired up, nigga what you thought it was 
 Buz cause nigga I don't give a fuck 
 (Canibus) 
 Niggaz like us don't give a fuck 
 Canibus and Kurupt, choke a nigga up 
 Comin' through in the four by four truck 
 Chromed from the flour up, with ????? 
 White air force ones with the low cut 
 I'm in the back of the jeep gettin' ????? 
 Me and my dawg Kurupt spark that skunk 
 I know I'm a G 'cause my name start with one 
 (Canibus) 
 We Horseman man the next Wu-Tang 
 You know the name, Killah Priest and Kurupt 
 Ras Kass to you heard of us 
 We go to the club, curse and 'cause 
 Start that buzz, that's wots up 
 Spike the punch, fight and fuzz 
 Rush that stage for the mic and bus 
 Straight up 'cause I love them guts 
 Don't call me unless you invite some sluts 
 36C cup with big butts 
 I pay big books to get my dick sucked 
 She can spit it up, then lick it back up 
 Thank you very much, there you go slut 
 A Benjamin Franklin was more than enough 
 Write your number down I'll be in touch 
 (Kurupt) 
 A Benjamin Franklin was more than enough 
 Bitch give me that cash before I fuck you up 
 Genuine banging in the deck 
 Same old G, D.P.G 
 Show you somethin' gangstafied 
 Do or die, gangstafied 
 Run and ride, now ride don't run 
 Fuck that nigga, blast that nigga 
 Lay that nigga, I spray that nigga 
 AK that nigga off weed and liquer 
 I drop a switch, fuck a bitch 
 Smash and dip with hollow tips 
 ????? Me up, what the fuck 
 Canibus and Kurupt choke a nigga up 
 Flippin through the cut, flash flood 
 Fluctuate ?????, pistol tooked, nigga
