High altitude EMP eagle horizon 
 Hermetic writing, rhymin', vocalin', vibin' 
 My mothafuckin' words swarm you like hundreds of hummingbirds 
 With serrated beaks and colored fur 
 Creations are primal 
 The Ripper talks to Vishnu and Shiva on top of unidentified Vimana 
 Nuclear strikes, project blue beam blue light 
 My straightaway speed is Nitrus oxide on the mic 
 Barium strikes, green beam sprite 
 So bright, I lost sight, I'm on a flight to Paraguay the same night 
 Symphonic, quantum content, cosmic consciousness 
 Should not continue to be compared to this nonsense 
 Is lovable but not intense, there's no positive effect 
 Yeah its colorful, but it's not correct 
 Complaining is entertaining 
 Name calling and false naming, all you motherfuckers do the same thing 
 Till my bare hands rip out your Pineal glands 
 Who the FUCK tryna' get hyphy with the old man?! 
 Horsepower at the push of a pedal, black and charred death metal 
 Dark rays with a gauge through the temple
