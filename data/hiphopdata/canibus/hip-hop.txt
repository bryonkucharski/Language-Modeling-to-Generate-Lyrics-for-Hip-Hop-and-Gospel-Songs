(Canibus) 
 Aiyo Canibus, Nottz, hold up, stop! 
 Let me find out this album ain't the one to cop 
 Beats bang like sounds of shots inside the chamber 
 Real niggas throw your hands up 
 I played the bench for a while but I'm back to the leather 
 Give a fuck how I played I'ma scorn the winners 
 Living with all the trimmings, blinging their cars and spendings 
 Fucking dogs and the college women 
 (Canibus) 
 See when the hardest fell, your armour melts through nigga 
 My 357 bigger than a fruit, nigga 
 Desert Eagle claws rip right through nigga 
 Aiyo Nottz, tell them what we came to do nigga 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo, Canibus nigga, you know the name nigga 
 Credit still good, ain't no change nigga 
 We speak the same language I ain't gotta explain it 
 Talk to the stainless, I replied with a short statement 
 My reputation was predicted by the ancients 
 2000 BC they was saying the same shit 
 They tried to spar with him, he had black Marn' in him 
 A crystal bottle of venom 
 They was fucking around with him, I tried to tell them 
 These rhymes is poisonous boy you will die trembling 
 A hundred niggas in the back joking, yelling, "Bust them" 
 Go ahead Bis let the vampire van touch them 
 My fan base sit and wait for the coming 
 They couldn't 'Follow the Leader' long enough so I drugged them 
 Stunting in the wagon, Chrysler Hemi 
 These Rolls gold Remy's look bigger than twenties 
 The poor man's Bentley, come here let me talk to you Slimmy 
 I got Jam Master Canibus in me 
 And I'm nice with multies, sick with the simi's 
 When I'm on mic I'm friendly so what can you give me?
