(Canibus) 
 Just blaze nigga 
 What? 
 You wanna battle with a Jesus piece? You need luck 
 You couldn't see me with a Jacob piece from Jesus 
 I'll lean you back like your spine just cracked 
 Rhyme chiropractor, get to adjust raps 
 Spit something, let me see if I'ma bust back 
 I front back, I'll go your ass till you collapse 
 Spin hats around like Sprewell hub-caps 
 My gun will clap faster than Savion Glover taps 
 Wave the four at you, if it takes more than that 
 I'll kick down your door, before you get the double axe 
 You're trapped with Can-I-Bus, just relax 
 I came to collect tax, it's as simple as that 
 I raid your refrigerator, but other than that 
 Before I leave, I remind you to remember your wack 
 My girl loves Usher, but she said he getting cocky 
 I told her, "Shut up," 'cause that's the same way she knocked me 
 In the name of Hip Hop, I rock beats, on block streets 
 There ain't an emcee that can stop me 
 Need more beats, Scott Storch ain't cheap 
 In Virginia, DMP and Knotz got heat 
 I get around like Pac and Shock-G 
 In a drop Jeep, licking off shots Sacchi 
 It don't have to be a special occasion, I be blazing 
 I'm Jamaican, you know that I don't worship no pagan 
 This is real Canibus, leave your nose aching 
 Niggas be hating, but on the low, they know the flow's dangerous 
 The Hip Hop Joe Namath, never missed a payment 
 Don't say shit to me, you talk to the niggas I came with 
 Kay Slay shit nigga, Drama King nigga 
 Bada Bing nigga
