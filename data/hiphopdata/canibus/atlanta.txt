(Canibus) 
 I wake up in the morn', turn my PlayStation on 
 Just bought that NFL Blitz and that Basket-Ball 
 I read the Vibe and Source, to see what's going on 
 I let my hair grow long, maybe braid it in the fall 
 Whenever I get bored, I just jump in my car 
 I go to Lennox Mall, and look for independent broads 
 Sometimes I get a nod, they treat me like a scrub 
 I go down to the schools, maybe I get more love 
 Three P.M. in the evening, I'm on the highway speeding 
 My front-left tires leaking, should have bought a new one last weekend 
 I guess I wasn't thinking, up ahead break-lights was blinking 
 For more than thirty minutes I was stuck in gridlock prison 
 This traffic drives me crazy, going West on two-eighty 
 Five bitch almost made me, crash into her Mercedes 
 I'm glad I almost missed her, I pushed the clutch and shifted 
 It was a white-lady, I'd rather hit a sister 
 'Cause see, I know the system, it's easier to trick them 
 I use my G to pimp them, then convince I'm the victim 
 Nah baby, you hit me, no I was in lane three 
 You need some contacts you can't see, no girl don't blame me 
 Don't panic just be patient, give the bitch the wrong information 
 She'll probably never claim it, scared of high insurance payments 
 I love my home Atlanta, I love my home Atlanta 
 I love my home Atlanta, I love my home Atlanta 
 (Canibus) 
 The land of pretty peaches, them girls with round features 
 Make a nigga say, "Good Jesus," them Georgia dime-pieces 
 Started off like, "What's your name? Tell me, what's your age? 
 You got a man? Can we be friends?" 
 I'm glad you feel that way, come on and ride with me 
 I take you to that Crunk bar where them sharks eat 
 Five-star baby, bon-appetite 
 I got that shrimp appetizer with that dog meat 
 If shorty want to creep, I bring her home with me 
 Just bought some candles and that Carl Thomas CD 
 Bootleg that Jay-Z, stole that OutKast 
 Been have that Keith Sweat, I know how to make it last 
 Smack that naked ass, she got a big butt 
 I ain't in no rush, plus she likes it rough 
 Kinky stuff like, leather and handcuffs 
 And them thangs you wrap around a man's you-know-what 
 That's why I love Atlanta, I can hardly stand-up 
 I'm a heavy drinker, fix me a cup and sinker 
 I always love Atlanta, that's why I love Atlanta 
 I love my home Atlanta, I love my home Atlanta 
 (Canibus) 
 As a young child I was so damn bad 
 Used to drive up the Ave with no tags 
 Niggaz couldn't see me, I was going so fast 
 Most niggaz catch whiplash and crash 
 Face all chipped up from the glass 
 Running from the police hauling ass 
 If I get caught, I just give them some cash 
 Most police give me dap and laugh 
 Other ones pull up behind the flash 
 Take a nightstick and tap the glass 
 Tell me, "Turn the music down," it's on blast 
 Turn the engine off 'cause I'm wasting gas 
 Tell them that I'm lost and I need a map 
 Looking for a hotel to take a nap 
 Freaknik, officer, I came for that 
 It was good last year that's why I'm back 
 That's when he tried to hit me 
 His big fist barely miss me 
 I have my camera with me 
 I think I'll sue the city 
 I love this place Atlanta 
 That's why I love Atlanta 
 I love my home Atlanta 
 I love my home Atlanta
