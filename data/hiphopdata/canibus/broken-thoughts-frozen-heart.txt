Inside the detox box I watch the clock 
 Outside the box I'm supposed to protect Hip Hop 
 The physician of weirdness, bald and beardless 
 Only the minds of the independent can hear this 
 Civilian population fear this 
 Only authorized personnel beyond this point, where this? 
 The hypercube room I don't know where it is 
 Microphone terrorist bare fist with brad tips 
 Fuck with the Brass Monkey 
 Look up when honey's ass is above me 
 She a high class rap junkie 
 She's headless, with her face emplaced in her chest 
 Below her breast she a cosmetic bitch 
 The snake eats the canary 
 They issued an order not to come near me 
 No matter how bad I sound when they hear me 
 Half man half wolf I daredevil off of the roof 
 And land on both tubes so don't move 
 Pounce teams listens to Al Green 
 Everybody in town dreams 
 That they saw the same cloud screen 
 The Majestic Mic Master Messiah 
 Kappelmeister the rhyming meat grinder 
 Code Name: Shadow Viper 
 Metalic hawk talons knock sharks off balance 
 Even went to see a play called Hamlet in all Spanish 
 Everyday that goes by I feel less important 
 If I'm right, I'll be nonexistent by the morning 
 Don't you spit 'One More Bar'. once barred 
 You may not stand for ten years or more are you sure? 
 Climbing the pyramid two blocks at a time 
 Till I'm face to face with Optimus Prime 
 'Bar War' rap in the Temple of Karnak 
 The wolf has no constituent need to bark back 
 Put your ear to the phone, it takes them three seconds 
 To pronounce the true casualty rosters' death tones 
 Rocket propelled bars from a Alaska's largest national park 
 Where helicopters crash in the dark. 
 The eagle was a phoenix, the phoenix is a zenith of a greater meaning 
 You are reading what I'm seeing 
 Lyrically theoretically I'm Schiaperrelli 
 The meaning behind Cydonia is so interesting 
 'Old Man of the Mountain' from New Hampshire 
 Says fire, live free, or die or retire 
 C-c-cold Leopold his whole bottom row solid gold 
 He possess all knowledge known 
 The verse I write is manufactured thermite 
 Spore bearing life forms come to life on the mic 
 Perigee and Apogee, your rhymes trapped in my gravity 
 Something that we understand naturally 
 Un-improvident talking prominent got full armament, 
 Bomb parliament Big John was a big part of it
