(Canibus) 
 I transmit images over the distance 
 Using the inflation premise of ten to the minus thirty-two seconds 
 Back to the Canibus Era, my eponym is apparent 
 Those who hear my efforts got to give me the merit 
 Off lyrics alone I'm a legend 
 But I can't take credit, the English language was not my invention 
 It's the way I put it together 
 The incorrect English editor, can't nobody ever do it better 
 People forget but the history will remember 
 I pled guilty to the charge and accepted the sentence 
 Let the records show I resisted under the pressure 
 My short but precise endeavour to raise the measure 
 (Canibus) 
 Hip-hop forever, that's what I see when I look in the mirror 
 Regardless of whether I'm not a bestseller 
 I'm a first class spitter, the literal literature ripper 
 Painting pictures for intelligent listeners 
 From any and all dispositions 
 The fusion of what's written creates a vision called Canibusism 
 The intellectual division of science and religion 
 People waste their momentum trying to defend it 
 All I do is put it to ink, then put it to print 
 See what you think, maybe I should speak to a shrink 
 I could fix the way they look at the world 
 They read all these books in a barrel but they can't think for themselves 
 Self-contained, I'm all balls, belts and brains 
 Must be strong because no one ever helps Germaine 
 (Canibus) 
 Observe the whole world's pain, and tell me you ain't tired of praying 
 The Catholic faith will never be the same 
 You can be put in chains because you've got a Muslim name 
 Sent to Guantanamo Bay and tortured for days 
 Man, I'd rather buy some land and grow an orchard of grapes 
 Drink vegetable-juice and stay away form steaks and shakes and snakes 
 These rats in the corporate race is fakes 
 Nobody ever gives you what they didn't already take 
 Invest away? You'll be broke till you break 
 Man, you learned to pick a lock, you want to open the gate 
 I mimic haters like flight simulators in air bases 
 Recovered from an inverted spin and now I'm famous 
 Those who respond to Rip the Jacker with hate 
 Show poor taste and only exacerbate their fate

 Motherfucker, get it right and get a mic
