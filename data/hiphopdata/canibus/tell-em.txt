 Tell them, whatever it is they will get it 
 Fact, fiction, myth, legend 
 I'ma tell 'em 
 White phosphorous clouds eject through the neck 
 A silver mesh that protects my mouth, face and neck 
 The first to introduce full-body proximity suits 
 To emcees who become recruits 
 I knew a submarine spook, that accidentally armed the nuke 
 All he could do was say "oops!" 
 Knowing the truth is moot, we got troops 
 In a deployment loop, under title 32 
 The constitution been reconstituted 
 "The contract that we signed was a con, stupid!" 
 Biofields collect energy from my flesh 
 Multiplicity effects take me higher yet 
 Happy hour empowers the mind 
 Red wine from the vine co-combines with my neuropeptides 
 Let's ride, Sumerian summary summarized 
 I implied, some will die, some will survive 
 Nano-chemical composures absorb the oral exposures 
 The stars begin to move closer 
 I reach out and touch novas, they respond with explosions 
 The eye of the wormhole opens 
 Step out the other side smoking, worshipped as the chosen 
 Behind me the Stargate closes 
 I sit down and make poetry in motion 
 The table and chair where I sit start floating 
 Hip Hop cops Black Ops, take notice 
 Record it, then show this, but still couldn't hold this 
 I work for CONUS, codename MOSES VERBOSUS 
 Classified rogue poet component 
 Serotonin, overflowing, I keep growing like the Samoans 
 Tsunami approaching, lower me into the ocean 
 Steadily telepathy-stabilized levies 
 That save lives, but I don't know how many 
 The flood was not an obstacle 
 I made a raft out of empty milk gallon bottles, for survival 
 The lamp is symbolic how they worship the phallus 
 Of the Melchizedek Chief Prophet Symphonic 
 At your service, twist the topic 
 Aliens, drop it, according to them, we do not exist 
 This is my race, I dictate the pace 
 But the law stipulates, I spit to save face 
 Dead in one sense, far more alive in another 
 Since my female vampire lover 
 She asked if I love her, then bit my chest 
 The last time I had sex with a dragon princess 
 I seek the keys to Da Vinci's antiquities 
 Beneath the pacts of little ____ 
 Extraordinary men, that meet to review and recommend 
 The Gubernatorial that never ends 
 Learn to give, the collective lives 
 Otherwise the Global Mind wouldn't affect your kids 
 That's how it is, you can ask his (??) 
 The NWO lives, nigga, good riddance
