Yo, yo, yo 
 This is the most magnetic, rap edit, ever permitted, 
 I'm the best that ever done it to somebody that did it 
 You sinnin' if you don't mention my name when you say lyrics, 
 Been spittin' since the beginning and never been timid, 
 Professor of English, drink a cup of tea like the British, 
 Biblical menace that's searching for the meaning that's hidden, 
 I rap for rippers, rip it for the lyrically privileged, 
 Strangle you bitches, battle Canibus?? You trippin', 
 Put your money where your mouth is, my dick where your chin is, 
 Swallow my flow like 
 My sentence telepathy lettered, take over your mind for a second, 
 Meditate at it till your eyes redden 
 It's the automatic, kinetic, energy in the present 
 Real G's spittin' geometric sentence impressions 
 Germaine starts with a G, who would've guessed, 
 The spirit of St.Germaine in my studio sessions, 
 Tellin' me what to tell em, I'm his vernacular vessel, 
 Binary bar stars make me rap 
 Kick it so intelligently and intensely, 
 You only a fool when you in the presence of me 
 The underlined agenda, under thoughts release foam? reverse course 
 Pick the hydrophone up and talk 
 Operational priority dispatch, spittin' raps trippin' the wack 
 Y'all don't want Bis to attack 
 Don't act like you forgot me, this is Debauchery 
 You wont get the nod from me, I put it down constantly 
 Ask hip-hop heads in ya area, imma spitbull terrier 
 The more metaphors the merrier 
 Pardon my fingernails I just buried the mic' 
 100 found... 
 Prolly ain't enough to fight, so they scared of my bite 
 Black holes coalesce when I tear through the light 
 I gotta funky, funky, funky, funky flow 
 Yeah funky times 4 is funky you know 
 I'm the C-A-N-I-B-U-S, my M-E-T-H-O-D is the best 
 You still not impressed? 
 My tongue compress, puncture your chest 
 Suck yeah breath, rob ya lungs through the breath 
 Poppy seed resin send you to Mic Club heaven 
 Light seconds away from Galaxy 87' 
 God caused these charged particles to collide 
 Within wandering, magnetic fuels in my mind 
 Still on the grind, do this in my spare time 
 Spare rhymes, 'cause I stopped looking for shine 
 You can't take what's already mine 
 Shoemaker levy 9 will land on 'em when they press rewind 
 A mental dime in a physical bondage 
 Waiting for environment? maybe then I'll be with some real Prophets 
 Oh my god! Canibus is on the college campus 
 I read after some questions because I love his answers 
 He gotta new album out he the illest son 
 44 curriculum syllabus caliber killing em' 
 November 19th the Mic Club spot check 
 Can't figure out how the bootleggers got it legged 
 You want respect come to MicClub.net 
 Try to move ya mouse after I chop ya wrist 
 OK, settle down kid stop talking big 
 Cause today we gonna have a pop quiz on Bis' 
 MicClub the Curriculum is dropping when?? 
 On November 19th, so go cop it its sick
