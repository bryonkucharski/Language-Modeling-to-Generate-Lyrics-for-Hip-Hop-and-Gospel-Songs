Not you burnt out yet? Aye, let's work up a sweat 
 Canibus ain't even finished with his verse yet 
 Let's be pragmatic, you're a sociopathic rap addict 
 Probably the best fashion if you have it 
 Diarrhoea in the vocal booth, this nigga don't know what to do 
 The only one he open up to is you 
 I said I right a hundred rhymes, he said he wrote one rhyme a hundred times 
 But it never sound tougher than mines 
 Spit a rhyme like Nasty Nas 
 Like Jaheim, Jadakiss to Jay-Z when he was on Jive 
 When Wolf died I was with Busta Rhymes 
 So much time passed I just can't adjust all the time 
 Here is the bread, here is the blood 
 There are fifty thugs in the room here's what we done 
 Crashed the mothership, the brothers of the UnderGods recovered it 
 Do you prefer public or private punishment, motherfucker
