(Canibus) 
 It's Mentally unimaginable, mathematically incalculable 
 Inextricably infallible 
 Let's not forget, utterly impossible or morally insurmountable 
 To assume that I could lose if I battled you 
 My scholastic aptitude is 1,602 
 A 100 bars was just a glimpse of the truth 
 Physical proof that I'm the best at this 
 I've constructed sentences, that'll stand longer then Stonehenge megaliths 
 My first and second albums consists of more then a million terabits 
 More then any of you rappers ever spit 
 Vote for me as president, in about a day or so 
 I'll be up in the White House, getting fellatio 
 By an administrative assistant with deep throat 
 Butt naked on the floor, knee deep in some coke 
 Or on a speaker phone, freestyling with some of my folks 
 Humping a whore tampering with the republican vote 
 I'm like Mel Gibson in Braveheart, fighting swordsman 
 Dodging arrows from the archers, 'cause I'm a horseman 
 Flying circles around you like flying saucers 
 Flying circles around the Royal Air Force's flying fortress 
 Maximize my wins, minimize my losses 
 Till I'm exhausted, then lounge like the lyricists on Rawkus 
 I'm unsigned right now, it's like I'm an orphan 
 Looking for a home taking all calls and offers 
 Notify the prince and the Duke of Earl 
 I'm probably the illest English speaking emcee in the world 
 (Canibus) 
 Ghetto fabulous, verbally hazardous 
 Ask any Baptist, Roman Catholic or satanic activist 
 Even them trippy hippies on college campuses know about Canibus 
 I've got fans like beads on an abacus 
 My styles totally out the bracket 
 Scientist with thick glasses and pocket protectors want to patent it 
 My talent is unmatched by any rapper in this rapping biz 
 By any rapper on this planet's grid 
 Show me where he is, I sign the ordinance 
 To bomb his coordinates with Agent Orange and torture him 
 Burn the skin off of him, throw a towel on him and stomp on him 
 Rip the towel off then pour salt on him 
 Continue my verbal assault on him till it's twelve in the morning 
 And turn into the werewolf monster on him 
 I rip his heart out, eat it while it's still pumping 
 The blood still running, it tastes like boiled dumplings 
 Starving artist, I turned down scholarships to Oxford College 
 'Cause I heard they didn't serve porridge 
 Smarter then any man in Scotland Yard is 
 Used to work for MI6 but quit 'cause I couldn't take orders 
 The most awesome walking, talking, breathing 
 English speaking emcee in the European region 
 Rip you to pieces like communism leaflets 
 Beef with 'Bis is like playing chess without the pieces 
 Modern Christians without Jesus, Rasta's without Reefer 
 Jamaican's in Princeton without Visa's 
 Radio's without speakers, Mother Nature without the four seasons 
 Without a jacket outside when it's freezing 
 I'ma tell you straight up, no lie 
 Canibus is the illest motherfucker alive 
 Yo, two-thousand and one 
 Another dog joint production 
 Word up, East-Side baby
