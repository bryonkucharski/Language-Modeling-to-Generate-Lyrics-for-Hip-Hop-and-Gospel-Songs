(Canibus) 
 Javelins hawk within striking distance 
 Alert to the sounds we hear, the rapid response verses in the air 
 I smell the tobacco, we know that you're here 
 So does the white tail buck and the black bears 
 What the fuck gave you the right? 
 To come into the wilderness just to pick a fight? 
 Whatever jurisdiction you from we rip mics 
 The B-line of blood trail in the dim light 
 Back to the kill site 
 Come here city boy, I hear you're real nice 
 Surrounded by dark so far from the city lights 
 Stop browsing, sniff downwind cowards 
 You pissed yourself, you smell more foul than public housing 
 Hardcore, parkour, tear off your car doors 
 Fire-breathing gargoyles, eating hyenas, charbroiled 
 Alien tongues long sharp but called predator claws 
 I rip through the Kevlar for your heart 
 Till your lower body support lost 
 The large carnivore Spitboss Beowulf rip your torsos off 
 Float like the flying Albatross, part Mothman part wasp 
 Ambush armour transport to the marsh 
 Javelin Fangz, Germaine's bombing raid campaign 
 My hands change when I drink Beowulf bane 
 You ain't seen nothing nearly as strange 
 Blurry as alien planes, still in the frame but nearly out of range 
 Canines, Sons of Cain, impervious to pain 
 Numb off cocaine, ripping railroad tracks off trains 
 Deranged batshit insane, rhymes liquefy brains 
 Daydreaming of rain, smoke haze and stargaze 
 AKs spray photon rage, Sharpshooter sharp fangs 
 Heart pumpin' napalm through coarse veins 
 Speak to barmaids, breath reeks of Grand Marnier 
 She says, "come on behave", I remove my dark shades 
 Eyes buried behind wrinkles like Shar Peis 
 I got a scarface from back in my dog days 
 The posttraumatic microphone mechanic 
 Leave the habitat damaged when I rat-a-tat that ratchet 
 You fucking with the Sharpshooter Masters
