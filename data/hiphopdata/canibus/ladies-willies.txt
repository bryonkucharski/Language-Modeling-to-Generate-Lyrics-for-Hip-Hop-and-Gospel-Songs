(Canibus) 
 Cap and Can, go together like a gat in a hand 
 (Canibus) 
 Professional thieves 
 (Canibus) 
 Disassembling V's 
 (Canibus) 
 Emcees with thin throats get lynched with thick ropes 
 Nod till they necks broke, and they cassette decks smoke 
 I'm probably the most murderous, merciless 
 Version of a modern day Copernicus, the world has ever heard of yet 
 Cold blooded and rugged, shove a gun turret to your stomach 
 And start busting till you shitting buckets of dry ice nuggets 
 Cold freestyling, cold rhyming 
 Cold enough to freeze the mucus lining, in your sinus, rock solid 
 Spitting, straight running through the competition 
 Quicker than calculators take to run through long division 
 Sprinting, from the beginning, from the start to the finish 
 Quicker than, the cameras niggas use to see a split decision 
 Arms swinging, a four fifth slinging, ammunition 
 Pop your clip in, Cap One and Canibus is, listen
