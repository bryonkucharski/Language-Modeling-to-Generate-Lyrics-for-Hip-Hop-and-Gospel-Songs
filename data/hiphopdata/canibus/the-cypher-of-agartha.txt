Darkness, put your lights out 
 Couldn't fight your way out of a urostomy bag or can of piss man 
 The strongest ones depart, the weakest ones fought till they lost 
 That's called Lyrical Law boss 
 Debonair cavalier caravaneer with a calculated stare 
 I stare because doubt is there 
 I'm a poet not a puppet, you'd think the higher ups would learn from it 
 They in love with something they can't stomach 
 Something called nothing, what of it? 
 I would like to change the subject 'cause right now you're just talking rubbish 
 Where them find ??? - underneath the brushes 
 Underneath the tunnels that are hidden in the tundras 
 Round Table knights with night vision 
 Night Shyamalan on the mic spitting on my Shambhala visit 
 Psychologically volatile, not really my style 
 To joke around, not about me, not about my sound 
 Appear in the clouds as eyes looking down 
 You talk foul, I know what you are now 
 Density light as a feather expand and contract 
 Fall out flat, land like cats, lets rap 
 Get back! Nice with his hands 
 Nice with a newspaper rolled up tight, assault rifle or a knife 
 24 inch machete, 24 hours to live 
 Come get me, my THUG Theory deadly 
 Lyrical Law is tribunal communal court 
 One juror with six faces, they all talk 
 At the same time till the people's minds are distraught 
 Javelin swords you know what they for, split your jaw 
 Everybody's surprised that you made it this far 
 Tens of thousands of songs the catalog just goes on 
 It's Lyrical Law, say no more!
