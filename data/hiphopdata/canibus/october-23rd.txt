(Canibus) 
 Yo, yo 
 Your rhymes are far from impressive 
 You got me snoring and I'm not even a narcoleptic 
 I gotta give you credit 
 You look like a garbage pail kid descendent 
 I used to collect them and I see the resemblance 
 I'll give you ten cents for every time you spit ten bars 
 Do it five times, you got enough to buy a candy bar 
 Let me hear some more, you ripped it God 
 Here's a penny, now get the fuck out of my face, you fraud 
 Niggas better raise the standards, or get the fuck off campus 
 'Cause you can't even talk to Canibus 
 Moved all over the place, I used to rhyme over Miami Bass 
 But kept moving state to state 
 I'm a rogue, I'm a warrior on the road 
 Like them CIA moles, living in shadows 
 A highly hazardous negro, with a patented flow 
 Crazier than a Hollywood actor would act on coke 
 I ain't no joke, ask Rakim 
 I wouldn't share the spotlight with anybody but him 
 And the Four Horsemen, the Yang and Yin 
 We open the can of big bang theory all over again 
 As deadly as a cobra fang puncturing your blood vein 
 Or Mad Max behind the wheel of a Mustang 
 Puffing a hundred and twenty nine octane 
 Enough thrust to achieve flight like prop-planes 
 Armed to the teeth like tanks in Iran 
 Driving like Terminator two through block lanes 
 You wanna be a thug, you better watch it man 
 Getting shot can't help you feel Tupac's pain 
 After the autopsy they'll just pull out your brain 
 Put it in a jar you probably won't feel a thing 
 They go straight to the pawn shop and pawn your bling 
 This rap industry is such a morbid thing 
 Country singers live different, their fans got more commitment 
 They get bigger shipments, big difference 
 It's a big fitness, and we can learn something 
 Why would you want to rap forever and earn nothing 
 I rap like the end of the earth is coming 
 Grab the mic and act like I wanna murder something 
 Cursing, fighting, or busting like a drunken Russian 
 Show me a wack emcee and I promise I'll bust him
