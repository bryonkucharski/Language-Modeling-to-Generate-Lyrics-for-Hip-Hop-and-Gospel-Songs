(Canibus) 
 Yo, yo, let me explain something so that you understand 
 You will never be iller than the Canibus man 
 You could be male, female, black, white 
 Fuck the details, I rip a nigga with a rhyme till he screams help 
 Any nigga I told to kneel knelt 
 You haven't the slighest idea what a real MC is about 
 You need to be yourself, you can't sound like nobody else 
 And you can't do all of the beats yourself 
 You can't do it without the streets help 
 Niggaz on the block that blast the boom box till the speakers melt 
 That's how I was brought up, big fat elephant balls what 
 I'm a knucklehead with big walnuts, small frame extra large guts 
 I'll do anything to a nigga if he pushes me hard enough 
 I use to rhyme like all day 
 I mean little nigga spittin' till my jaws felt sore with pain 
 I use to train with myself in the mirror 
 Like "Mirror mirror on the wall, tell me who's iller" 
 How you like that? I use to say it just like that 
 Maybe I should copyright that, I'll be right back 
 (Pause) 
 Sorry to leave you hangin' 
 I write things down quick 'cause I ain't takin' no chances 
 That's the difference between you and me 
 You a wanna-be, and I'm an MC 
 I'm just in the booth right now 
 I'm just kickin it with you right now 
 I'm tellin' you the truth right now 
 You can't fuck with the Canibus man, you can't fuck with the Canibus man 
 (Canibus) 
 Now in this rap field, I got a lot of confirmed kills 
 I put niggaz through drills to prove if they got true skills 
 You coulda sold millions, but if you ain't got 100 bars shut the fuck up 
 At least don't talk to me, 'cause I ain't hearin you 
 If you that ill, give me a hundred bars, I'm darin you 
 I definitely ain't scared of you 
 I go to war 'cause I'm prepared to lose 
 Just as long as I get to damage you 
 Take the mic from you, then put a knife in you 
 That's what I like to do, make you lose a pint or two 
 If you a lion I'm a tiger too 
 I could be as nice as you, but if you a snake I'm a viper too 
 Look you in the eyes and lie to you 
 Thinkin' about all the possible ways to kill you while I smile at you 
 You like to get fly nigga I'm a pilot too 
 Don't even try to get deep 'cause I'm a diver too 
 Don't try to fit in my shoes 'cause you can't 
 Nobody can fuck with the Canibus man, understand? 
 (Canibus) 
 My mouth is mechanically mechanized, my verbal weapon fires 
 A whole clip of rhymes before you can get off one round 
 Can-I-Bus will bust ya, apply enough pressure to crush ya, 
 I pulverize mother fuckers 
 Leave MC's laid out like hurricane debris, 
 Fifteen Megatons of TNT 
 The overseas block buster 
 Bustin' up blocks like the Tiguska meteorite to hit Russia 
 Comin' from the underground I discovered 
 A ground underneath the ground of all underground bunkers 
 Dedicate it's blunkers, deeper than the labrith 
 Conducting excavations of the matrix 
 Living in uninhabitable places, 
 Craters of a desert like oasis with a cydonian faces 
 As barren as Las Vegas, as barren as the wombs 
 Of women who use artificial insemination 
 As barren as Utah's Salt Lake City basin 
 As barren as ancient Egypt before irrigation 
 A five-star chef making mouth-watering creations 
 With blood stains on my apron 
 Put the heads of wack MC's in my oven and bake them 
 Then garlic bread sticks in their eye sockets and taste them 
 It's not really that odd 
 When you consider part of the Asian culture loves to eat dogs 
 Feline cats with their claws, paws and all 
 Caucasians eat frogs, African-Americans eat the hog 
 Hindus in India will kneel to the floor 
 And worship cows and rats as gods 
 I raise the odds, spit rhymes towards Mars 
 And beyond to the nearest binary star 
 I'mma tell you once more my main man 
 Nbbody can't fuck with the Canibus man
