(Canibus) 
 It's Canibus nigga, five years later damaging niggas 
 Cancelling niggas, paramedics is bandaging niggas 
 I'm tired of pampering niggas, I'm an animal nigga 
 Get the Desert Eagle and just start hammering niggas 
 I should take a field trip and go camping with niggas 
 Turn into Charles Manson and start strangling niggas 
 Talk about the Blair witch and start amping the niggas 
 Then get it on camera while the bears mangling niggas 
 Stand back talking shit like it's none of my business 
 You didn't listen, now you got a head full of stitches 
 I'm an animal nigga, micro organisms swim in my saliva 
 Because I drink river aqua, I'm a survivor 
 So give thanks to the father, like the Rastas 
 'Cause I believe in karma, beat you down like the brown bomber 
 While you scream out in horror, these people came to see a fight, not an opera 
 Now you got no honor, you got dropped by your record label and your sponsors 
 But you still go up to the office, and pretend you're on the roster 
 Like your working on another project, I think you lost it 
 Psychological hardship, plus the new gossip 
 Is you homo and you swallow dick 
 You used to date nothing but model chicks, but you came out the closet 
 Now you're dealing with the problems and the politics 
 You the opposite of what I am 
 Give a pound to yourself 'cause I ain't shaking your hand 
 I'ma grown man trying to get gold by the grand 
 You in a wasteland pacing back and forth in the sand 
 That's why they hate the Canibus man, I'm better than them 
 In a minute I'ma be getting more cheddar than them 
 I'm more independent than them 
 So I don't care if the pothole dented my rims, I rented the Benz 
 The only thing I give a fuck about is lead in my pen 
 I'm on a higher level than them 
 I didn't have to sell my soul to the devil to win 
 The only thing I pawned is a watch, bezel the rim 
 Sip a cold mineral drink, smoke a couple nickels and think 
 What's the next move a nigga should make 
 Maybe I should invest in some stocks and bonds 
 Drive out to Vegas and stick my cock in a few broads 
 Princesses tongue kiss frogs 
 On the West Coast you can do whatever the fuck you want 
 That's why I moved out there, 'cause it's cool out there 
 My crews out there, watch what I'ma do out there 
 I'ma wreck shit, Can-I-Bus will bless shit 
 My tongues reckless, check the press kit 
 Verbally vicious, telekinetically gifted 
 Canibus is known for spitting that ill shit 
 Motha fuckers
