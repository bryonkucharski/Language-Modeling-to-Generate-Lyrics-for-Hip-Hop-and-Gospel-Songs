(Born Sun) 
 Bastard style with no father tryna claim the kid 
 I called it X 'cause I ain't even tryna name the shit 
 Sundullah, see me on the stage with Rip 
 Nitrogen lungs yo my tongue mix propane with spit 
 And I'm nice, the voice of Christ resurrected through mics 
 Son of God, Son of Man, helping some of y'all will overstand 
 Crash the Vatican as soon as I land 
 I'm 'bout to set it on man in the gulf of Adan 
 I stand in the Garden of Eden, unbeaten, undefeated 
 I Tweeted pictures of Eve, tonguing Jesus 
 Scientology guides put my rhymes on photography slides 
 To quantify the higher knowledge applied 
 But I'm an uncaged animal channeling Hannibal 
 A cannibal bite your head off and hand it to you 
 SpitBoss, centrifugal force different from yours 
 Sun is Born, this is Lyrical Law, Yo! 
 *Break* 
 (K-Rino) 
 I've never been a friendly author, don't need a gangster beat to make me off ya 
 I'll slaughter ya while playing Cyndi Lauper 
 Better than y'all, give me one competitive brawl 
 I throw a hundred miles an hour with a medicine ball 
 I melt your fortress down to caramel softness 
 Drive a charger through ya torso, parallel parking 
 That cosmic ray beam effect, I Hiroshima wreck 
 Rap disaster so tragic they gave his ass a FEMA check 
 Cadence is radiant, I predated Arcadians 
 I stayed with the brigade of alien ecto sapiens 
 Hit your through the atrium of heavenly light 
 Once I smite you, like a left arm you'll never be right 
 I've used every word possible to let you know what I can do 
 So I made something new, I'll collipherously clobber you 
 You ain't legitimate, you posing like a model 
 Dude I'll throttle you, liquidate and sixteen ounce bottle you 
 *Break* 
 (Canibus) 
 I'm tryna figure out, who this nigga barking at 
 Before his heart gets snatched, run up on him in a stocking cap 
 Keep barking like you hard, get stalked and clapped 
 Come in the cage you get stomped on the mat 
 Carve your name in the axe, then chop you in the back 
 Hack off your femur bones, beat you with them like bats 
 Put your remains in some saran wrap, dump them in an alcohol vat 
 You can rap but you ain't all that 
 Step inside, close the door, fuck you yawning for? 
 Kick your head off, now it's rolling on the floor like a bowling ball 
 Open the door, clean this fucking mess off my wall 
 And don't ever mention his name no more 
 You dig, you follow me nigga, I follow you quicker 
 You got a weak ticker, told you not to fuck with the Ripper 
 Have you showing your true colours, drinking blood from ya liver 
 You a dickrider and you an Indian giver 
 Waging war with some gorillas, I'll bludgeon you by the river 
 The bar range is pissing he gon find you while you fishing 
 Fistula face, herpes simplex I'll break 
 Alienated aliens get ate by alien apes 
 You food nigga, throw yourself over the gate 
 How does alien taste? Like mammalian waste 
 You ain't swift you's a dumb fuck 
 I'll have you breathing like your lungs got struck by two-hundred pound nunchucks 
 Brave motherfuckers get slayed for Hip Hop if you love it 
 Like Kill Bill between a hundred gay lovers 
 I'm the illest nigga say something... 
 Yeah I thought so, shut the fuck up things will go back to normal 
 I ain't happy tho, now I'm in battle mode 
 The president of Hip Hop with mad motherfuckers on the grassy knoll 
 I take it back to my Curriculum days 
 What you say? I body you in meticulous ways 
 'Cause you thought I was a donut, you tried to glaze 
 Let me tell you something, don't pop shit fistula face 
 Battle league nigga, talking shit's for amateurs nigga 
 Goddammit, y'all living off fantasies nigga 
 You wanna battle that bad, aight go get your camera 
 When it's my turn, I got a four and a half pound answer 
 When I was young, I took down hard targets 
 You a sausage nigga, for coming at me like a novice 
 You never heard 'Fraternity of the Impoverished'? 
 Motherfucker, can't you see that I'm an artist 
 I don't want them childish problems 
 Lyrical manslaughter charges interfere with my Lyrical Law process 
 Out rap me, that's preposterous, metaphor marksman mudswamping 
 We hunt down Hip Hop monsters 
 Skin 'em alive tie their carcass to the bottom of my Polaris 
 And drive them all the way to Wisconsin 
 Partner, fuck around, throw your ass under the bus face down 
 Lay down, we gonna wait for this greyhound 
 The fuck you gonna say now? 
 Do me a favour, stop weighing me down 
 Fucking clown, Lyrical Law is too muscle bound 
 Houdini style nigga, just struggle and drown 
 Get it over with you can never fuck with my style 
 You got raped nigga, you bleeding, don't touch my towel 
 You can spit them wack juice punchline lines all you want 
 But don't front, bottom line, I'm a champ, you a chump 
 You can spit your stupid punchlines all you want 
 But after this the whole world gonna see who won 
 That's what you wanted right, get the fuck off my mic
