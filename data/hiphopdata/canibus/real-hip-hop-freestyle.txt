(Canibus) 
 Yeah, let's go 
 Yo, yo 
 I put it to you so raw, you probably O.D. on the floor 
 That's what you get for disagreeing with God 
 The Lebron James Bond, my aim with the arm is so long 
 That I can tag along with Socom 
 I spit to the beat, flip like Swizz did to the beat 
 At sunrise, I spit to the East 
 Niggas talk shit in the streets, when they about to get released 
 They ain't got no lip for the beast 
 Make you strip like police, I point the heat 
 From the hip to get leverage if you more than four deep 
 Got a pistol grip hawk with a chrome beak 
 Shit is so deep, I check to make sure there's no leaks 
 Looking like Jada in a black Jagari 
 Half Jag, half Ferrari, the valet saw me 
 Shorty want to know how the flesh work 
 What's under my sweatshirt, that's why I hit the gym till my chest hurt 
 Next year summer I'ma kill the conjecture 
 For now I'm just a hustler trying to give you my best work
