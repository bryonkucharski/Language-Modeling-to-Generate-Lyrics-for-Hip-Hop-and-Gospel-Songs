The dark ruler in the dark blue Star Cruiser 
 A very large Bravada and a parked Dodge Charger 
 Who art thou Father, the mini gun chopper sing opera 
 You out of air, get you when you pop up 
 Iron Lung's wire tongue tied fungus up in a bun 
 Germaine strain H5N1 
 Horse tranquilliser rhyme stud, I designed the buds 
 Make your rhymes shrivel up to lime rust 
 The bombs lay stacked on the floor above the door 
 Of the Bombay, I can drop bombs all day 
 Spit over Boom Bap till tooth crack 
 I got tooth caps for new jacks, I produce raps 
 A snake swallowing himself from the tail 
 Niggas fail tryna spit rhymes of this scale 
 Suivez-moi, come vibe with your boy 
 With lyrics the whole industry silently enjoyed 
 I'm so nice I amaze myself 
 I just listen to the playback and chase myself 
 A hundred generations later my rap style's still greater 
 Priceless, ask the appraiser 
 Snipe after the kill, after the thrill 
 I'm dog Tony Numskull how does it feel? 
 To beat a Jesus Christ Superstar from the cookoo farm 
 My oolong is too beaucoup for ya moms 
 Rip the Jack spit liquid crack 
 Light a spliff with a match till my lips is black 
 I knelt down emotional meltdown 
 I'm hellbound, I look around when the bell sound 
 You ready, then stand steady, ya hands feel heavy 
 Here come the enemy, fuck how many 
 You ready, rebound, think out loud 
 One Blood, Canibus, y'all niggas bow down 
 Snatch your crown with ya head still attached to it
