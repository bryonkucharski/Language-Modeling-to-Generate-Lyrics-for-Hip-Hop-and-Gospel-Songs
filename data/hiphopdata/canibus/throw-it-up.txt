(Canibus) 
 Mark niggas and busters 
 (Canibus) 
 Jakes that want to handcuff us 
 (Canibus) 
 (A) 
 (Canibus) 
 Foes that want to touch us 
 (Canibus) 
 Kidnap your baby's mother's mother 
 (Canibus) 
 Me and Kool G Rap, we stash the heaters in the (B) 
 (Canibus) 
 Throw it up, throw it up, throw it up high 
 Rep for your set, nigga, show me that you live 
 One mic, two mics, three mics, four 
 A hundred bars, or more, till my voice goes hoarse 
 (Canibus) 
 Kool G Rap rocks the mic, we both nice 
 So our voices is twice as horrifying at an expensive price 
 As horrifying as a blade of a knife, stabbing you twice 
 Horrifying enough to melt mics 
 I snatch you up by your hands and feet, tie them tight 
 Cry for your life, while you get beat with an iron pipe 
 My rhymes, worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize ribbon 
 I should just log-on and carbon copy the world with them 
 '2000 B.C.', my CD 
 Will shock you like two hundred volts DC, repeatedly 
 Two thousand CC's of liquid weed 
 Injected into the arms of all your Hip Hop fiends 
 The dominant, nuclear armament 
 My submarine's underwater with launch coordinates, to sink your cargo ship 
 Soon as the radar blips, I charge with a blitz 
 Break your jaws with my fist, fix the scar with a stitch 
 Break your legs and arms, make you crawl like a Crip 
 Then fuck your bitch raw, sprinkle salt on my dick 
 G Rap, Can-I-Bus, M.O.P. 
 How 'bout some hardcore shit for two G 
 Motherfuckers
