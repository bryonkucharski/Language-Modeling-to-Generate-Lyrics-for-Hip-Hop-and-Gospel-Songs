Song: Group Home Family 
 Featured Artists: Lost Boyz 
 Album: 
 (Canibus) 
 My dick's like planet Earth; everybody's on it 
 Used to kick rhymes for free, on street corners 
 Group Home is the name of my organization 
 We gets busy like phones without call-waiting 
 Cold killing them, cold blooded reptilian 
 To rock, none stop, for the millennium 
 Listen, everyone in my crew be spitting 
 Eight niggas deep in a Ford Expedition 
 I rock ice bigger than boulders 
 My shine be bright enough to give a nigga Glaucoma 
 Never sober, breaking it down the hardest 
 The live artists, that beats dead carcass 
 The C.I.A., wants to murder, 'cause verbally 
 I'm a threat to National Security 
 With the freestyle instinct, we think quick 
 And set it off like Jada Pinkett
