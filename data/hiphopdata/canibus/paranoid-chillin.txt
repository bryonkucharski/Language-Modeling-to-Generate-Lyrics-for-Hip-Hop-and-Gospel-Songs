(Canibus) 
 A nigga off the street can't control his stardom 
 A Senator can't walk like a thug from Harlem 
 Therein lies the problem, nothing to do with being an artist 
 Even the heartless tell it from the heart, Bis 
 I'm quite cathartic, writing rhymes smelling my armpits 
 Drawing designs for my starship 
 Laying in the poem, insects crawling out of my clothes 
 A stream of vomit pours out of my nose 
 Body gases decompose, can't find a hole? 
 Then explode, we be picking pieces off a the road 
 I'm a 'Buffalo Soldier' with buffalo rhymes 
 I make buffalo wings out of buffalo hides 
 Bacteriophage growing in my garage 
 In the form of rhymes I will warn you one time 
 Unimaginable, track you through your longitude and latitude 
 Just to ask you what the fuck is the matter with you 
 Old school, new school, no school rules 
 But other than that you a motherfucking fool 
 Canibus spitting completely detached from the human condition 
 'Cause what a Ripper spits is usually different 
 You better sober up, your battle rap moment is up 
 You can't write songs, I'm telling you it's holding you up 
 With the knowledge landline built into Can's mind 
 He can control time, but not just yet, let him rhyme 
 Wanna battle nigga, set up a time 
 You gotta bring it to the SpitBoss 
 That's how we settle it right 
 Otherwise you can suck my dick and eat shit 
 From a dike, you can't take nothing from me on the mic 
 What you talking about Willis you ain't no lyricist 
 Bis is the illest, with every stroke I'll be killing your spirit 
 As we exhibit lyrical fitness, everybody watching and listening 
 I'm the only one that's not paying attention 
 Still spitting freestyles or ill writtens there's something you missing 
 You never put an album out but you quitting 
 How intelligent is that, you can't rap 
 They used to call you the best, now you can't get it back 
 I don't just spit rap, I'm on some spiritual shit 
 Took it so far the blue marks are still where I used to sit 
 Undisturbed unheard of structures under the Earth 
 I don't know what to look for first, if you want we can search 
 Don't know what I'm looking for, but I know what it's worth 
 I know what I wanna say and what I want from the verse 
 This is something when I was young that I learnt 
 How to spit like Dirt McGirt, catch the Holy Ghost in church 
 Would you care to have to Hors d'œuvres or more metaphors and words 
 With the way you still rhyme, I'm concerned 
 That you Paranoid Chillin' 
 Illing and killing the skill is in the lyrics, Sick Since what you feeling?
