You wanna fight with the champ? You bite with the vamps 
 You got gloves, you can dance? I got a mic in my hand 
 A red-blooded affair, nothing to fear 
 Every time this year we appear in the square 
 Get it on, get it in gear. He gettin' at you? Get him in here 
 We gon' have to get a couple things clear 
 The art is here, no matter what type'a armor the warrior wear 
 The story of glory brought me to tears 
 Mexicano, Chino, Gringo, Negro 
 To the head, to the body with the dumbbell deathblow 
 Do not let 'em go, 'cause I said so 
 We champions let's go, we all bleed red bro
