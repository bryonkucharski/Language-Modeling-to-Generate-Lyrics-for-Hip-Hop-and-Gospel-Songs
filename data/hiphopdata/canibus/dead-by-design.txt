Professor Griff: 
 Canibus 
 Throwing melanated molotov cocktails 
 Engineer directly out of Full Sail 
 Ripping the jacker, ain't nobody nastier 
 Spitting and grabbing facts and data to enhance ya 
 Canibus the lyrical adjective killer 
 Canibus: 
 My Melatonin Magik is enhanced by the melatonin tablets 
 Come take a walk with Canibus 
 Ardipithecus Ramidus, what the fuck is Melatonin Magik Bis? 
 I still ain't understanding this shit 
 Okay, my brain is a microchip 
 My two balls with a cane is a macro-dick, I rap so sick 
 I created swine PLOO out of an infinite mix 
 You tried to diss but can't even spit, you just stand there and wish 
 With your hand on your hips, man you a bitch 
 Who the fuck is you to criticize a lyrical king 
 You see, that's my problem, I spit a thousand bars y'all was silent 
 I ain't heard nothing about it 
 I had to give you three years to recognize 
 And then I realized, can't nobody even fuck with my rhymes 
 The Internet is an early telepathic building set 
 My lyrics are international nuclear missile threats 
 The blogosphere is where you vent frustration and discontent 
 But children don't understand the concept of consequence 
 So yes, it's immature to express disrespect 
 But no I will not accept what the media says 
 They are the reason we are being mislead 
 There are forces above them that feed off our stress, suffering and debt 
 I am Dead by Design, 'cause nobody tells me what to rhyme 
 I make up my own fucking mind 
 There are more of us than them 
 But at the same time they are gods and we are just mortal men 
 Thirteen levels above 33, let me say it again 
 They are gods and we are just mortal men 
 I cannot imagine their power 
 They put a black family in the White House just so they can take away ours 
 You tryna to plan a great escape? You're a coward 
 They gon' make us march into a gas chamber make us think we're taking a shower 
 Mommas and babies is crying 
 The children of Zion belong to Skynet, nobody knows who's behind it 
 So if you don't care, fine then, I don't care either 
 But I ain't spineless like you, I'm a true believer 
 In the metaphysical ether, you listening to the lyrical reaper 
 The spiritual teacher, empirical speaker 
 After this album they gon' call me a leader 
 But I'm not, Killuminati just gon' murder me like Pac 
 Blood sacrifice or not, I don't even wanna be alive 
 If it's like that, then fuck Tiamat 
 You can laugh at my appearance 
 Well fuck you for standing there staring, fuck everything on this planet 
 Including the evil spirits, notwithstanding the aliens 
 Acting like they don't hear us, there's no need to fear us 
 Just come down and help us, I love James Brown more than I love Elvis 
 But that don't mean I'm selfish 
 Soft but hard on the outside like shellfish 
 Crispy, crunchy, black crawling out of Hell's pit 
 You scream for hardcore, I felt it 
 But what you gon' do when they kill me on some Eminem and L shit? 
 You won't do a motherfucking thing 
 'Cause let me tell you why, you a coward and you don't know shit 
 'Cause if my Brothers stand next to me, the energy expands collectively 
 The world was never ready for me 
 And they ain't ready for their own freedom neither, they perish from the heater 
 The fire breathers crawl out of their cage to eat 'em 
 Like thin crust pizza, Cthulhu creatures with rough features 
 Jeepers creepers, good luck with Jesus 
 How many meters? Reload and squeeze it 
 I run up in the Vatican with demons, just to get even 
 That's where the biggest demon is 
 It's no secret, but nobody else sees it, so they won't believe it 
 But that's when I calm back down, the key word is back down 
 I got possessed by my own raps, wow 
 Knock knock, who's home? The black Dan Brown 
 I didn't mean what I said, please don't kill me now 
 My ghostwriter's not around, plus it was just a freestyle 
 But at least I got better beats now 
 Meanwhile, motherfuckers still mad, I feel bad 
 I'd apologize but you acting like a real fag 
 What the fuck I'm supposed to feel like? 
 Twelve years later I still don't get acknowledged for shit that I write 
 But I don't want to talk to you now 
 It'd be a motherfucking miracle if you even see me walking around 
 They still ask me about 'Second Round' even now 
 (Interviewers voice) Canibus can you tell us of what happened again? - Look at this fucking clown 
 Can't get over it, they ask me a loaded question 
 And act like I'm the one that's promoted it, hang up on 'em 
 You a cyborg unit with no soul to it 
 Stupid surrogate, twelve years later I'm on some other shit 
 And so is the whole world, look at the mother ships 
 And so is the whole world, look at the mother ships 
 Professor Griff: 
 After this album they gon' call me a leader but I'm not 
 The Illuminati just gon' kill me just like they did Pac 
 Blood sacrifice or not 
 It's Professor Griff the ex-minister
