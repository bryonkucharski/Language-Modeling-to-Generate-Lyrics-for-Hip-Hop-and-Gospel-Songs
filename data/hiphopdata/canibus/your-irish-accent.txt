(Canibus) 
 For those of you who failed to prepare. well now you must prepare to fail 
 It doesn't matter what your desire entails 
 I sit around the table with me ale 
 As I sip from the grail, "Barkeeper bring another pale" 
 Here's a gold coin and some wisdom for you little girls and boys 
 Rip the Jacker's coming out of that void 
 And when he arrives you're going to see the fire in his eyes 
 He will help you uncover all of the lies 
 The lies that were told and spread across the globe 
 To enslave mankind until the end of time 
 The leprechaun carrying his own megagrammaton 
 Megalodon transforming words with his energon 
 There's no substitute for it, indeed he is one of a kind 
 Rip the Jacker and his infinite rhyme 
 (Canibus) 
 19 planets and 38 moons, a tabernacle room with 38 tombs 
 Lazor beam rap flow, shove this J.O.B. 
 Take this anti-cathode and shove it down ya rat hole 
 You dirty, stinking, disgusting crackhead troll 
 You ain't shit, how many raps you wrote? 
 You sit there on a computer and doodle, rhyming noodles with goo-goo 
 You ostracized anybody that knew you 
 As the world turns daily, they use you, 
 Fast talk and loose you, you ain't for that ??? 
 You now rocking with the best, best, best 
 I'm put Rap to the test, test 
 Canibus the rapper, the vet, Rip the Jacker the master, the myth 
 Experimenting with the Baxter effect 
 Naturally they water me, I grow, they irritate me, I explode, 
 A dozen albums deep why is that a joke? 
 From Apollo 11 to moon base 12 
 I transport you from hell on Earth to space hell 
 I speak at frequencies frequently speaking 
 Translate the Phoenician heart beat increasing, the translator starts wheezing 
 Analytically speaking, 
 Ten million bars of lithium depletion is the reason I beat him. 
 To advertise is not wise, these wack niggas bite my rhymes 
 Waste time and compromise, lies 
 The consequence of my believe system, nah G, you tripping 
 They don't even understand what you spitting 
 Trial prep possess style in depth, 
 I'm 10,000 rhymes and running and I ain't even freestyled yet 
 Full capability prototype, the pop killer poltergeist 
 I rap for real, you post on a site 
 Tell my why you ignore it, try it, you'd probably enjoy it 
 What's the point if you dying to avoid it? 
 I quantum leap into the beat, 10,000 molecules meet 
 This ain't for the average MC 
 Memories of the future, penalties of the past 
 The righteous will never venture down that path 
 (Canibus) 
 The rough cold holds of the grumpy old man 
 He exists beyond machines, dreams and programs 
 The NWO plans you stand for they physical scan 
 They sold they soul, now they wanna go H.A.M. 
 I'm protected by the blood of the lamb 
 They running for they lives covered by the mud of the land 
 Fuck that, my fans called me a stubborn old man 
 Lock and load, lick shots until my gun bolt jam 
 Radio control D.O.D. drones with both hands 
 Scrambled eggs, raisin toast and a bowl of old bran 
 I'm the Hip Hop G.O.A.T. 
 I ain't got to prove shit no mo' 'cause they know that I am 
 GrandWizard Master trap you like Alaskan crabbers 
 Nasty bastard, I smash you in a ?spam of cabbage? 
 Haters can't stand it, 10,000 bars too much to manage 
 Motherfuckers can't even understand it 
 Contact Schrodinger's cat, Canibus the rapper owns rap 
 Only a handful of people know that 
 Yeah, I'm writing, rhyming, vocalling and vibing 
 Dragons watching the Phoenix fly over the horizon 
 My high altitude EMP eludes hot pursuit 
 EPMD, Mic Doc in the booth 
 You talking to me? Nah, I ain't talking to you 
 Your label treats you like a Hip Hop prostitute 
 I got juice, dry socks and boots 
 The industry crucified Hip Hop, Tupac is proof 
 I don't know what I don't know, but god damnit I know how to flow 
 And that's all I ever need to show 
 Speak, spoke a decision that you made on your own 
 The weight of the world versus the weight of your poems 
 The main area of operations is chosen 
 Take two teams and call me when you get to the opening 
 August 11,1973 
 Hip Hop done gave birth to the first MC 
 The master Rip the Jacker, the microphone controller clashing 
 Slang slashin', I'm shinobi assassin 
 Irregular programming, thermal scope scanning, holding a cannon 
 Heat resistant clothes found between your bone fragments 
 The metaphor tactician, edit chief with the lyrics 
 Any word that you ever wanted to visit 
 I rip shows, establish foothold from get-go 
 Show you how to flow, show you how this rap shit goes 
 I loved Hip Hop from the beginning, back when it had no limit 
 Back spinning to new galactic beginnin's 
 I love it, I live it, I wouldn't give it up for a minute 
 Every minute of spitting they miss hundreds of lyrics
