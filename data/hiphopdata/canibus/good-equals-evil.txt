(Chorus: Canibus) 
 A man pays dues, do this become an angel 
 Good and evil, a man stays true 
 There are other ways to win 
 Good and Evil, it's the same thing 
 (Canibus) 
 A decade after my debut, the game changed; I got the same views 
 To me it's just baseball and I'm Babe Ruth 
 Bambataa from Planet Rock, trade op commander Hip Hop 
 What? We grimlock smash Spitbox 
 You can never be the best, until you complete the competency test 
 With Rap pattern parameters I set 
 Are you deaf? Do you need me to repeat what I said? 
 I said you'll never be the best unless you pass this test 
 Okay, fill out registration form 88, 
 Name, social, date of birth, address, city and state 
 When the form is complete pass it on to Angela Clark 
 To determine your eligibility and get you insured 
 Every morning the board panel assembly judges man by his bars 
 Courage of heart and what he offers the cause 
 If he's accepted he'll be sworn in tomorrow 
 If he's rejected he's recycled and retested on stage at the Apollo 
 I had to and so do you, are you solid or hollow? 
 Depression is normal, a challenge to climb out of your sorrow 
 Forget about the world around you, the truth is 
 They are nothing without you but you will be nothing without the truth 
 (Chorus: Canibus) 
 A man stays true, a man pays dues 
 If a man can do this, the man become an angel 
 There are other ways to win, a consequence for every sin 
 But we are blind because Good and Evil is the same thing 
 (Canibus) 
 Do not be confused by the choice of words used 
 For every battle we win, there's something we lose 
 But you still have to choose and choosing not to choose is still a choice 
 Sometimes silence is a powerful voice 
 The body is of no use if the mind is enslaved 
 But theses slaves can not bind your light or your sound waves 
 However, we must to train to increase our strength 
 The final test is presented when we least expect 
 We look forward, we see 180 degrees, what's left? 
 We eyeball right to left but see nothing, what's next? 
 180 degrees of regret, what's that? 
 It's everything we left behind unchecked, it wants revenge 
 They want revenge against us because we fight for our freedoms 
 Die for what we believe in and they know we don't need 'em 
 I know you disagree, you think it's fortune cookie shit 
 But I guarantee you this, our future was prefixed 
 (Chorus: Canibus) 
 A man stays true, a man pays dues 
 If a man can do this, the man become an angel 
 There are other ways to win, a consequence for every sin 
 But we are blind because Good and Evil is the same thing 
 A man stays true, a man pays dues 
 If a man can do this, the man become an angel 
 There are other ways to win, a consequence for every sin 
 But we are blind because Good and Evil is the same thing 
 (Canibus) 
 I look towards the sky for the answers to why 
 I analyze the great divide and saw God on both sides 
 God didn't do this, we did this to each other 
 So keep his name out your mouth, you fucking cock suckers 
 How could you own all of it, when we are all apart of this? 
 The Earth belongs to every living thing that walks upon it 
 We are all perfect creations, with imperfect justifications 
 But just the patient fuck the subject of Satan 
 The Universe is too huge, does Satan live out their too? 
 Or is he just after me and you? 
 Believe what you perceive 
 Look at the Sun, tell what do you see? 360 degrees of light beams 
 Illuminating Hip Hop, Spitboss'll bag your pops 
 You ain't ready for the shit that I got 
 It's called Hip Hop homey, that's the only way that you know me 
 And knowing people can still be lonely 
 At the Maharaji spa for the whole week 
 I just go to sleep because when I wake up I am not an emcee 
 I get back on the clock when I hear the next beat 
 I'll write about another century of heat, I'm a beast 
 (Chorus: Canibus) 
 A man stays true, a man pays dues 
 If a man can do this, the man become an angel 
 There are other ways to win, a consequence for every sin 
 But we are blind because Good and Evil is the same thing 
 A man stays true, a man pays dues 
 If a man can do this, the man become an angel 
 There are other ways to win, a consequence for every sin 
 But we are blind because Good and Evil is the same thing
