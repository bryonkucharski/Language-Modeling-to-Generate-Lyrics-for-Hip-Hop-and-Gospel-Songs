I got a beat sensitive style, just cross the infinite mile 
 Always had this gift as a child to write poetry 
 If I ever dip through ya town, then you know it's me 
 Canibus be rippin it down 
 Bitches blowin' me, fightin over lickin' it down 
 I hold on to they thong start stripin it down 
 If I cough in my fist when I open my hand 
 There be dope in my hand that's how dope a nigga am 
 Canibus just enter the building y'all 
 If ya lookin' for the illest start filming y'all 
 The iron clad nomad my flow smash rip up the whole jam 
 When I leave the audience hold hands 
 Hand ya face back to you pleasantly 
 For thinkin' anything less of me then you better be Hennessey 
 Or make me pull up on a moped 
 While ya man is yellin' code Red I reload again 
 It made ya man stop talkin' 
 Its hard to see the white meat after I hot sauce him 
 It's not about paper I'm not talkin' 
 20 million a movie, I still rob the fuckin' box office 
 Strap the visor gold with it 
 An inverted gold rodeo flow will give you flow sickness
