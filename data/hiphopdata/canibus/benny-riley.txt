DJ's, cuttin' up beats and stuff like that and 
 That was my first exposure to the whole, artistry in hip-hop 
 There is nothing in this music, that I don't wanna hear 
 There is words, that are kind of syncopated and rhythmic 
 And there's this hot drum track, it's great! 
 (Chorus: repeat 2X) 
 "This is, this is great! This is, this is great!" 
 And I could hear, this enormous 
 "This is, this is great! This is, this is great!" 
 This is music, I've been waiting all my life to hear 
 (Canibus) 
 Ayo 
 I don't give a fuck if you getting some cash, or getting some ass 
 If I was there, I'd pick up the tab 
 Toss you a rag, tell you to wipe your stinking ass 
 Get back to the lab, make sure Hip-Hop lasts 
 Do death before dishonor, I do this 'cause I wanna 
 Your body armor don't protect you from your karma 
 Ready for the encounter, like a titty-bar bouncer 
 Or Muhammed in the Mini-Mart counter with four-pounders 
 Quick-draw, McGraw spitter 
 Let me see you hands jitter, I'll hit you where the good Lord split you 
 You faggot ass niggas' is see-through 
 I treat you like we in the same cell, but I'm Bugsy Segal 
 Smack your teeth loose, for street juice 
 Go to court in cheap-suits, giving testimony over beat-loops 
 Take them to my hood, show the evil I'm from 
 They can't blame me for the evil I've done, now they see why I run 
 Why I keep a tight leash on the gun 
 Why my speech is so revered by the young, 'cause my spirit is young 
 A nigga spitting like that, got serious lungs 
 Yo, I'm serious son, he a furious one 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo 
 The name Benny Riley, the trip took twenty-eight days 
 From New-York to Cali, driving through alleys 
 My mom mad at me, my dad laughs at me 
 My life's a tragedy, I need this record deal 
 Precious, she got the freshest breasts' 
 And an ass from heaven; thirty-six, twenty-four, thirty-seven 
 She the second broad I ever humped under a bridge 
 But she the first broad I ever fucked within the record 'biz 
 Desi told her I was crazy, and she called the Feds 
 The bitch didn't know any better; I let her live 
 She don't know Desi is a greasy fucking pig 
 And he set me up for something he knows I never did 
 When I see him, I'ma put the Smith and Wesson to his head 
 To change his outlook on life, maybe I'll show him what it's like to be dead 
 Like the way I look at lyrics 
 I kill it till they dead; it's that vivid 
 Got skills to kill the rap business 
 Got bills to put a contract on the witness if he rat-snitching 
 Niggas' in the back, digging holes for your next acting role 
 Get buried with your cash and gold 
 Your assets sold, your family Marlon Brando broke 
 Shattered hopes, rapper's joke, took it like a man though 
 Benny Riley is the closest thing to Canibus yo 
 Niggas' just don't be understanding his flow, until the hammer let go 
 Grab the mic and cold damage the show 
 Get split with bananas flows, at the Canibus Bowl 
 This is music, I've been waiting all my life to hear 
 And I didn't know it
