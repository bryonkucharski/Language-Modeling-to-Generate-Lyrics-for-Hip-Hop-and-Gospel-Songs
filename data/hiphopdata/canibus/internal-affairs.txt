These external layers expose the internal affairs, 
 The midwife delivered a divine prodigy with white hair, 
 The light bearer the golden era joint task 
 Fight force terror take flight in poor weather, 
 By decree, by decree at the emcee who spits by the sea, 
 The illest lyricist nobody can beat, 
 Fire breathing beast smell like burnt tonsils and teeth, 
 Try to scream your body will be cremated by the heat, 
 Try to beef you secrete a red substance on the street, 
 Dump you in the ocean the ocean will dump you on the beach, 
 The only thing we got in common, 
 A lot of motherfuckers going to be crying, 
 When the EKG go silent 
 Crucifix pain I bomb it then launch another rocket, 
 St. Germaine co-signed it then we both go Atomic, 
 In the rainforest with a rifle and rangefinder, 
 A burlap sack and a rack-mounted analyser, 
 Taking hip-hop for hostage, 
 My zero tolerance policy put pressure on the pussy who pops shit, 
 You want it edited or do you want me to shred it rip, 
 Where's your spitboss membership? We'll talk in a minute kid, 
 We talk about problems, what you going to do to solve em, 
 Even so, how you gonna stop them, 
 Moving on your living and your dead, 
 Like a giant Jurassic Rasta with dreads with a million spider legs!
