(Canibus) 
 It's the phantom of the opera 
 The Dracula Caligula unpopular 
 Melt your ocular with rocket-thrust processors 
 I dare you to touch the touch-screen monitors 
 Without proper gloves 
 Melt the skin off your fingers till they look like rounded nubs 
 As retarded as Forrest Gump 
 You're nothing but a two-pump chump 
 Drunk punk with a puss filled prostate lump 
 You think that skunk stunk? 
 You should have smelled that decomposing cunt 
 That sick, gruesome grunt dumped in my trunk 
 I'm a hunter that's ready to discontinue the hunt 
 But I'm gonna keep ripping you scum till the millennium's done 
 You couldn't pass if you was gassed out of your ass 
 I'll battle you in front of Sterling Library after class 
 You Get slumped, spending your tuition on blunts, you're a dunce 
 You get rejected trying to join Mic-Club 
 Feces hit the fan from the front 
 Liquid liters of diarrhea, not mud 
 No, it's beet juice not blood 
 Truncate your trunk 
 Decapitate your face with a gun 
 Assassin with your tongue 
 Remove seven-eighths of your lung 
 Donate it to monks with jumpsuits, zip down in the front 
 For easy access when they get crunk with the nuns 
 As peaceful as Evel Knievel using a dirty heroine needle 
 After a four hundred and eighty foot jump 
 Perform verbal acrobatic magic with crash-proof tactics 
 Stuntmen say the 'F'-word more than once 
 Put you on point, P.R.T (Poor Righteous Teachers) your funky joint 
 With proof like nineteen thirty three double-eagle coins 
 "Bring Tha Noize" like enemies out in public 
 You know you love it 
 A genie bottle covered with porcupine follicles 
 Try and rub it 
 Blood drips till the tub's flooded 
 My dead enemies lay there gutted 
 Till year two thousand and forty something 
 In the meantime, everybody's outside running 
 'Cause the puppet-master behind the curtain is coming 
 With some hydrochloric stuffed in the luggage 
 A "Final Call" newspaper under his arm saying, 'Peace, my brothers' 
 Resonances from my vocal tracks smothers the others 
 I'll bring Sparxx to any Bubba, make him guzzle pig blubber 
 Do a "Ninja Man" cover, tell you to suck your mother 
 If I wanted to get at you I'd just infect your lover 
 Your girl's an exceptionally good sucker 
 She ain't got no tan, I'll tap that ass till it changes color 
 Get technical with decibels that are connected to you 
 The audible is too incredible to sell them to you 
 I'd rather tuck you in at night and tell them to you 
 I introduce you to the new words and spell them for you 
 Dropping jewels with unpunctuatingly possible sexigonical chronicles 
 Burn you up faster than two hundred pounds of fuel 
 In helicopters doing loops out in Kabul 
 Compared to me, you're a out-turn, a penniless fool 
 I'll take you to school, expose you to the negative news 
 Take you out for drinks, put some sedatives in your booze 
 If you manage to win I'll kill you, so it's better you lose 
 But I'll set it up so you win and celebrate it with you 
 I'll break the truth to you at a quarter till five 
 Look you square in the eye 
 And tell you that there's nowhere for you to hide 
 Triangulate your flow to wherever you rhyme 
 Quint-angulate your fibers one thread at a time 
 Bare this in mind, look a little deeper you'll find 
 Line for line, Canibus is the Red Giant of rhymes 
 Mic-Club: The Curriculum, November nineteenth 
 B-Y-O-B-V: Bring your own bottle of Visine 
 Yale University, community broadcast emergency 
 Kublai Khan proofread this verse for me 
 T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound transcribed it just out of courtesy 
 Then I gave them the bird 'cause they looked like nerds to me 
 MicClub dot net, where real emcees perform lyrical surgery 
 With Pentium circuitry 
 Canibus, Yale University 
 The best way to encourage me is to keep discouraging me 
 They keep trying to front on me 
 They don't want none of me 
 Float like a butterfly, sting like a bumblebee 
 No seeds yet, so you're lucky there's only one of me 
 Rip the Jacker's skullduggery on a summer's eve 
 The real Hip-Hop community got love for me 
 That's why I give the love back 
 Mic Club the Curriculum, a thousand bars, who could touch that?
