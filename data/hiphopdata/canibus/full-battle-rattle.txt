 "You wanna face lift? This is what it takes 'Bis 
 A beat that'll make a nigga think an earthquake hit" 
 The blue-collar rapper, enigmatic, democratic 
 Rap-savvy fanatic that could smash any match-up 
 High when I wrote this, bring welding goggles to my show 
 My flow glow brighter than any diamond that you know 
 I walk among you, draw energy from you 
 The Art of Sun-Tzu, he used to bus' too 
 I'm like a Shaolin monk on crunk 
 Holding himself up with his thumb on a stump 
 Get a Hummer for the summer to stunt 
 And just sit in the front while my lungs become one with a blunt 
 Futuristic old-schooler, look like JFK Jr. when I suit up 
 Jacob 'The Jeweler' with an new cut 
 Can-I-Bus! I ain't got what I want yet 
 How could you respect one of the best 
 What, I can't get no 
 Grab the mic, nigga, let's go 
 Bet me who got the best flow 
 You end up with less doe 
 Open your vest, let your chest show 
 I'ma open your chest, let your breath go with a .38 Special 
 Keep it on the low, don't let the press know 
 Behind the scenes they put me on death row and won't let go 
 Brace yourself while I break the chains 
 My beats bang so hard they erase the plains 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo 
 This is full battle rattle, attack you 
 Salute or I'll smash you 
 Can-I-Bus bus' to blast you 
 Full battle rattle, attack you 
 Salute or I'll smash you 
 Can-I-Bus bus' to blast you 
 Full battle rattle, attack you 
 Salute or I'll smash you 
 Can-I-Bus bus' to blast you 
 Full battle rattle, attack you 
 Salute or I'll smash you 
 Can-I-Bus bus' to blast you 
 (Canibus) 
 The Hundred Bar Monster spit without hawkin' up 
 Smash your whole roster, fuck what it cost ya' 
 Fuck what it cost me, join the army smoke Bob Marley 
 The sergeant major honorably discharged me 
 For my sinsemilla and my hemp incense 
 Inspiration, why it's only worth ten percent 
 Another day in the life for Mr. Can-I-Bus 
 My life too rough for me not to recognize rough 
 The soldier's back to blow a fucking hole through rap 
 I wish they'd let me out the cage and stop holding me back 
 You might say the only thing holding me back is myself 
 It ain't hard to tell what's holding me back is my sales 
 I don't make record for girls, I spit for the borough 
 But I'm an artist in an ignorant world 
 World class athlete trained to attack beats 
 Mixtapes smash the streets, try to patch the leaks 
 Niggas try to battle me but lose, they got limited views 
 I remember when I was primitive too 
 I sit and talk with the inquisitive youth, 'cause I be spittin' the truth 
 Sometimes I ask them, "What you listenin' to?" 
 Lyrical fitness is the proof, let me put you in the booth 
 Nottz'll play the beat-loop, let me see what you can do 
 The older advise the younger when they recognize the hunger 
 I do a couple reps with the mic to get pumped up 
 Monkey-bar sit-ups, blood rush to my head 
 I write rhymes upside-down with an astronaut pen 
 Spit a hot sixteen at Mach 10, take it up a notch then 
 Launch everything when I'm locked in 
 You in the kill-zone boxed in 
 Tried to play jump rope with skis on and got dropped when you hopped in 
 The Last Mohican, smoke you in the first season 
 You don't speak it but it's no secret 
 Peep it, you lightweight like rice-cakes 
 Anybody under twenty-one that touch the microphone is mic-bait 
 Hungry niggas start to get tight-faced, that's when the fight breaks 
 A sixty second round is a nice pace 
 Work a nigga out till he spit up white paste 
 Tell him he can hide the bruise on his face with nightshade 
 If you looking for a battle you came to the right place 
 This is Mic Club and over here I'm the Mic Ace

 Yo 
 This is full battle rattle, attack you 
 Salute or I'll smash you 
 Can-I-Bus bus' to blast you 
 Full battle rattle, attack you 
 Salute or I'll smash you 
 Can-I-Bus bus' to blast you 
 Full battle rattle, attack you 
 Salute or I'll smash you 
 Can-I-Bus bus' to blast you 
 Full battle rattle, attack you 
 Salute or I'll smash you 
 Can-I-Bus bus' to blast you
