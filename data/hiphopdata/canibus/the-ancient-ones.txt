I was born in Jamaica, reincarnated by the Creator 
 I crawled out of a meteorite crater 
 Bat-shit crazy, I feel like Hip Hop hate me 
 They erased me and my sanity escaped me 
 Sumerian, Israelian, mammalian mixed with alien 
 From the constellation of Aquarius 
 The logo was branded on the back of the savage 
 Who demanded your daughter's hand in marriage for sex magick 
 The light glows on the Agate, rock in the cabin 
 She and I stand before a rabbi in dark fabric 
 The best man is a jealous scumbag maggot 
 He's also her best friend who pretends to be a faggot 
 Next passage: death is a language, I'm Hannibal Lecter 
 Coronate metaphors with my sword and sceptre 
 I was never the best, just corrupted by the weight of success 
 Could've been more productive with less breath 
 I translate codes, animate 1's and 0's 
 To sideways 8 till something great unfolds 
 These are the Psalms unknown, reborn to the bone, 
 It feels wrong, look at these rags I have worn
