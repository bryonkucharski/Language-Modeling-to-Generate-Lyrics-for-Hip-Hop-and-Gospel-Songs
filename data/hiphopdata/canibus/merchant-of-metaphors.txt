I need a jet stream pattern assessment, go get it 
 And tell me the direction that the fuel tank is headed 
 Scram jet packs straps attached to my back 
 Rocket exhaust melt skin off like wet wax 
 Call sign Tom Cat, master ace of aerial combat 
 I double-time out to the tarmac 
 Fog covers the launch pad 
 Order ATC to fall back, but maintain visual contacts 
 Switch to radar, innovation navigational star map 
 I won't need to travel beyond that 
 My jet contrails so long that, 
 It can be seen in time zones eight hours apart by NORAD 
 Bow waves are made when I sweep my arms back 
 To fast track to the lunar surface's dark patch 
 The darkest part of the Moon where ISS2 was parked at 
 Inside onyx black alien artifacts 
 Well guarded in the event of a chartered attack 
 The outpost is nothing more than a trap 
 The red planet approach close, I know perigee and impact 
 Phobos is controlled by the Dracs 
 Deimos is the most underrated of the pack 
 It decimates NEA's more than double its mass 
 A solar max melts polar caps 
 I notice that think tanks with closed minds miss unknown facts 
 Satellites track and match the stats, statistics start to stack 
 I'm a man of science, not rap 
 With actionable impulse to act when I can't relax 
 I work hard but play harder in fact 
 My rose garden attracts rats, 
 I sit back and listen to jazz and smoke hash in a mineral bath 
 I meditate, slightly awake, the moon rays interpermeate my physical state 
 I gaze into space 
 The light waves race and shift shape, colors escape 
 I concentrate on eight frequency rates 
 The body begins to numb as the spirit elevates 
 But wait, I'm interrupted by a buzzer at my front gate 
 Closed circuit surveillance showed me a face 
 How entertaining, special agents came to visit my estate 
 "Miss Moneypenny, bring me a plate, a cup of tea, and my terry-cloth robe, 
 Then show them in to me, I'll wait" 
 He walked in with a blank face, I calmly remarked, "You're late" 
 He responded with a strong handshake 
 Miss Moneypenny returned with eggs and pancakes 
 I offered them a seat, standing up, looked so out of place 
 He kindly obliged, but the other two continued to stand 
 Folded their hands, and gave me the nod 
 The silence was so profound, that even soft sound seems loud 
 With ambient music in the background 
 I slurped when I sipped my tea, it was hot 
 I chomped when I chewed my chow, it was not 
 In slow motion the silence was broken, you could hear a pin drop 
 He said, "You cannot save Hip Hop" 
 I said why not? I sold mixtapes to buy stock 
 I've been researching and developing a spitbox 
 Rap is deeply rooted in the music generation 
 I can prove it, but it doesn't constitute publication 
 I swear the Great Bear entered the Dragon's Lair 
 I was there in the center of St. Petersburg Square 
 Assigned as a silent observer, but I witnessed a murder 
 Took a picture of the body and a burner 
 Circa the time, you called me from Burma 
 In Port Charlotte Florida, say you were in a coastal corridor 
 And that's what you call help? 
 Eight months of Camp Kill Ya' Self couldn't rehabilitate what I felt 
 And now, here you are, in my backyard 
 Accusing me for being an outlaw for my bars? 
 I ain't got nothing for ya, I'll call my controller, 
 You call your employers, they can talk to my lawyers 
 He got up, and turned his back on me and said, "I'll be back homie" 
 I said you better bring an army 
 He said, "You don't want war" 
 I called Moneypenny on the intercom and said, "Baby, show them to the door" 
 To be continued, stay tuned for more 
 Secret dialogue from the Merchant of Metaphors...
