Job interview, recession reaches a new pinnacle 
 My stimulus package is lyrical 
 Canibus spit a few, one, two, one, two 
 One, one, one, one, one, two, one, two 
 Yo 
 Shaquille O'Neill got a piece of steel 
 With the drum magazine that looked like a truck wheel 
 He said, "Go 'head Bis, I'ma hold them off" 
 I said, "I stay with you Boss" and got back on my horse 
 It's about to get dark, it could be a little while before the clouds part 
 So just do what I tell you when I talk 
 Change how you see the world, look at yourself in it 
 How much can you matter if you are not infinite 
 For every lyric I spit, there's a hater in the midst 
 Do it with fists, Kevlar grips, triggers and shit 
 They wheel me in the booth, unstrap me 
 I vocal the truth, fuck up Take One, but ates Take Two 
 Can you relate to this my dude, I'm the best and I'm not being rude 
 Even if I'm by myself in my room 
 I work with you, you don't have to sell no units 
 This is Hip Hop brother, we can all do this 
 Think up something, no not that 
 I meant something easier than real rap, like tryna stop meteor impacts 
 I've got rhymes, so many you may as well not have any 
 The world might as well be ending, the earthquakes are trembling 
 The respect is condescending, I reject ______________ presenting 
 Non violent venting, what exactly are you recommending? 
 Heavy Mental rap shit strategies, tactics 
 Vernacular gymnastics, line up for your SpitBoss patches 
 Not you 'cause lyrically you got your ass kicked 
 Come back when you got rap mastered 
 Do more practice
