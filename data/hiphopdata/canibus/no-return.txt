 No Return,

 No Return,

 There's No Return, 
 No Return... 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo, 
 Scientists gather in a secret place to debate, 
 They photographed the earth from space and saw my face, 
 They tried to translate the innate Asiatic shape, 
 Before the final earthquakes came but it was too late, 
 Only one-eighth of the human race escaped to space, 
 They were chased by flying phenomena to the lunar base, 
 Flotillas of space centers, lasers probed the entrance, 
 DNA code sensors reject old genetics, 
 I presented my cosmic clearance to a patrol of medics, 
 I was injected with sodium pentothal and questioned, 
 I relayed the message the way I was trained to remember it, 
 I showed them the keypad code and told them to enter it, 
 I told them which alphanumeric buttons were sensitive, 
 He snatched it out of my hand and started depressing it, 
 I told him detonation was definite if he kept at it, 
 And he'd never quit, he just lost his temper and flipped, 
 I bowed my head like, 'I guess this is it,' 
 My ears popped, the music stopped, and I couldn't hear shit

 The driver jogged around to the front and opened the door, 
 He said his name was Muhammed Jamal and he'd be with me till fall, 
 He said the escort service had called, 
 And the package would be waiting for me at the Winthorp, 
 I said thanks, he grabbed my bags fast and put them in the trunk, 
 Then he ran around to the front, slammed it in gear, pulled off slow, 
 Winded down his window and asked me if I minded if he smoked, 
 I said, "No", we drove off, 
 Cut my cell-phone off, then I swallowed a tablet of Zoloft, 
 Went to sleep and woke up feeling kind of lost, 
 I asked him what the weather's been like lately, 
 He said he doesn't mind the heater and hates the A/C, 
 He said he had a son who was eighteen and made beats, 
 And I happened to be his favourite emcee, I said, "For real? That's crazy! 
 I'll meet him later. Yo Jamal, could you please do me a favor? 
 When we get to the corner, stop at the bodega," 
 Hopped out the car, walked inside, 
 The store stereo was playing Feliz Navidad, 
 Got a pack of condoms and walked to the back of the line, 
 There was three Taliban that were talking very loud, 
 One reached in his backside and pulled out a Berretta gun, 
 The last word I heard myself say was a four-letter one, 
 He looked me in the eyes and said, "The drama's never done." 
 'Cause there's no return, 
 No return 
 (Canibus) 
 I heard the ring tone of the red phone, 
 Headquarters informed us there was an explosion in the Red Zone, 
 We were ordered to get ready to go, 
 And to get into our bio-weapons protective gear and clothes, 
 I rode shotgun, my partner Ramirez drove, 
 G.P.S. control gave us coordinates where to go, 
 As soon as we got there I could feel the hot air, 
 For a second I stopped and stared, there was cops everywhere, 
 I told them, "We need to get a square perimeter clear, 
 We've got an hour till nightfall, so light some flares," 
 I said a twenty-second prayer then ran to the second tier, 
 The lifter was there, then I waved my hands up in the air, 
 To signal that it was clear before I ran upstairs, 
 I could barely see smoke was so thick in the air, 
 I was visually impaired and started to get scared, 
 I heard a woman scream, "Help!" but I didn't know where, 
 I started screaming back, "I'm not going to leave you here!" 
 Saying to myself, damn it's hard to breathe in here, 
 Searched the rooms one by one, like fuck my lungs, 
 Ramirez said, "The fire truck got stuck by the front," 
 I crawled all the way through the foyer to the end of the hallway, 
 And seen her on the floor next to the doorway, 
 I was half-unconscious, but I just ignored the pain, 
 Helped her to her feet and she had her arm in a brace, 
 All this tar-like black stuff was all on her face, 
 I radioed Ramirez coughing and tried to explain, 
 I heard him say something to me like, "It's all in flames!" 
 There was ceiling debris falling all over the place, 
 I looked her in the eye, she looked into mine, it was strange, 
 Then I blinked for the last time and never saw again.
