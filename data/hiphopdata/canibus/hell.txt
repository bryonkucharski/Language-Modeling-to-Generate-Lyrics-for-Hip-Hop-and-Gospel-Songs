F-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-follow for now 
 For no formidable fights I've been formed to forget 
 For pharoahe fucks familiar foes first 
 Befo' fondlin female MC's fiercely 
 Focus upon the facts that facts can be fabricated to form lies 
 My phonetics alone forces feeble MC's into defense on the fly 
 Feel me, for real-a 
 Let's get the skrilla's out the hands of these gorillas 
 Make the whole world feel us 
 From the crack to the cap peelers 
 To the niggaz in the back shootin craps wit the axe-wheelers 
 Relax till it's, time for the immaculate miraculous 
 Thirteen, ooowww, the illest! 
 To all my niggaz who been shitted on, let's get it on 
 Think I'm gonna let it hang, and sit it on 
 The desk of any redneck record exec 
 I strike 'em wit the right hand send 'em a step 
 And this is (hell!) this is (hell!) 
 This is (hell!) 9x 
 This is hell, incest kids under pressure 
 In the corner clutchin they genitals by the dresser 
 A hundred cc's of the uncut cleanest 
 In the vein, twenty-four hours of intravenous 
 To the left, we have right wing extremists 
 On a screen a man exposes his breasts wit no penis 
 Martinez, probably 
 Just as raw as lady saw esocidae this is (hell!) 
 This is (hell!) 8x 
 This is, this is, this is, this is 
 This is, this is, this is, this is 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo yo I feel like I'm one of the livest 
 One of hip hop's finest, elite rhymers 
 And I plan to graduate with honors 
 But one day we'll all be a bunch of old-timers wit alzheimer's 
 Looking at our label's roster wondering how the fuck they forgot us 
 After we done recorded dozens of albums 
 And made 'em hundreds of thousands of dollars, they still dropped us 
 We giving niggaz what the fuck they want 
 A holocaust, stomping niggaz wit a thousand man march 
 I ain't living in Hell, Hell's living in me 
 That's why I'm always screaming on you fucking MCs 
 The shit that I quote, float with the buoyancy of a boat 
 With the potency of a scorpion sting to the throat 
 Overdose that's extremely fatal 
 Doctors in white lab coats scramble for an antidote to save you 
 You can't breathe, your chest feels painful 
 Your skin colour's going from dark brown to beige-blue 
 Your whole room is full of angels 
 All in your ear trying to tell you which God you should pray to 
 You pray to Jesus, but he don't wanna save you 
 'Cause you unfaithful, so he gives you to azazel 
 You're paralyzed on the operating table 
 Praying for Canibus to slice you from head to navel 
 You banned from TV, banned from CDs 
 Banned from DVDs and downloadable mp3s!
