Yeah ayo, 
 Listen to the horns play, 
 I get busy all day, 
 I don't give a fuck what they wanna say. 
 This is me turning it up, 
 This is me burning it up, 
 You, observing the emcee bus. 
 Just a coach on the side lines, 
 Tryna bide time, 
 Watching the game being played out through my eyes. 
 I know it's painful how they degrade you, 
 But I praise you. 
 This is the soundtrack that we will train to. 
 This is not a call to arms 
 I did that ten years ago, 
 These are called keep alert bars. 
 Don't talk just work your jaws, 
 Don't walk just work the war, 
 That's a personal flaw. 
 Murdered bar after bar since 1974 
 When I was born with a mic on my arm. 
 Awesome, 
 Six minutes Canibus you on. 
 Yes, yes y'all. 
 To the beat god, next bar. 
 I do this to atone, 
 I do this to atone for my sins, 
 But I am punished for the tone of my skin. 
 Bring it down about 14.5 DB 
 Maybe then you might see what I mean. 
 Out in Berkley 
 They not too thirsty 
 They don't like veterans neither, but they can't hurt me. 
 Bring it down about 14.5 DB 
 Maybe then you might see what I mean. 
 Ayo, Hip-hop provost 
 Who said the word Hip-hop the most? 
 Which one of yous think you a poet? 
 Perfect cause you practice that classic, 
 Scholastic, Canibus man shit. 
 The current catalogue and past tense. 
 I do this to atone, 
 We all must atone for our sins, 
 But I am punished for the tone of my skin. 
 The C of tranquility - the C means light, 
 The light means space, my DNA strain is my base. 
 Don't know who I am, 
 Can't remember who I was. 
 I pump blood through the veins of Hip-hop, 
 For street buzz. 
 A constitution written in collusion 
 With limited distribution, 
 Since I was recruited I've bin making music.
