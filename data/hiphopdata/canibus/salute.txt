The war drums sound like a hundred guns fired at once 
 For an entire month 
 Can-I-Bus? You know you can (4x) 
 Involuntary muscle spasm assassin busts with a passion 
 Listen to how Canibus re-enact this 
 Poor rappers fall victim to the metaphor master 
 Drill your ass raw for ice core data 
 An earthquake machine being powered by a crystal 
 Scalene in hydro, no pulse signal 
 Lyrically wave-theory like Timothy Leary 
 So you don't have to understand me to hear me, you feel me? 
 Barely, the quickening happens in between 
 In the Elohim Lord Lizard King with the Ripper conditioning 
 Partitioning with the Fischer King eating chicken wings 
 My fingertips are glistening but I'm listening 
 Yeah, the master observes how rappers use vernacular 
 To fail to capture the meaning attached to the words 
 Hip-Hop melismas, career suicide 
 Killer Ripper spits to the sustained pitch mixed and chopped 
 To add a counter point, mix a master that drops 
 Complex and confusing, I'm laughing because it's hot 
 The super duper uber music conductor producer from the future 
 Stuff tubas with gunpowders to improvise bazookas 
 Colder than killer cobras over Jehovah 
 Delta soldiers in blimp balloon gondolas with stealth motors 
 They watch over us, told me where to go 
 But I can only take both of us so you better soldier up 
 Size, activity, location, unit 
 Time and equipment: What you going to do with it? 
 Salute, that's what they do when I rip it 
 I proved it, I did it, "D-R Period" was in the booth when I spit it 
 Bread and Butter, Nigga 
 Beyond Canibus motherfucker, broken Language the hustler 
 Starboard rudder, the Coast Guard Cutter 
 I'm the studio night-owl, stress give me white eyebrows 
 Who the fuck I got to fight with now? 
 Yeah, conspicuous characters creep through America 
 With a killer chemical in a canister called Canibus 
 Crazy as crystal communicate correct signal 
 They call it criminal, I call it lyrical 
 Call the Commissioner I'm going to crucify the Christian Caligula 
 Like they crucified M.C. Christopher 
 I cast the Canibus symbol in the crowd 
 If there's beef on the ground, I'm going to carve the cow 
 Now, smuggle contraband through the canal 
 I check my clip on my chamber, sharpshooter style 
 La Costa Nostra, deep like Deepak Chopra 
 I kick your door down in loafers 
 .45 in the holster, AK in the baby stroller 
 Babies with baking soda, my lady in the Rover 
 A midget with dreadlocks down to his toes 
 With flows I expose what nobody knows
