Canibus! 
 (Intro: Canibus) 
 Coiled, ready to strike! 
 Ready to the left, ready to the right 
 I got the green light... 
 The lyrical is instinctual, try to keep up with the visuals 
 This was specifically written for you 
 (Canibus) 
 Self-examination, practice, patience, 
 Like the policy payments of a hospital patient 
 This is Hip Hop's nature, 
 Germaine is a supervising trainer, barrel roll bars like a swamp gator, 
 Two seconds later get ate up by something you can't escape from, 
 The homicidal rhymes that your mind made up 
 The agoraphobic poet, Hip Hop Mandelbrot hocus pocus 
 He's a maniac, you've always known this! 
 I smash mics like they made from graphite, 
 Grab the pad and write while I talk to the lab mice 
 Stuttering fools mumbling something that means nothing to you, 
 I huff and puff and blow down the booth 
 They say, "Spit it out Bis!", but don't like the rhymes I come out with, 
 The lyrics are fibromyalgic 
 Spit like a beast then I spiritual fast for two weeks 
 With a new catalogue of beats, 
 The eyeball of Odin recording every movement and moment 
 Measuring your body temperature and voltage, 
 Third Eye growing, 
 The rhyme is a pine cone poem identified as a thunderstorm
