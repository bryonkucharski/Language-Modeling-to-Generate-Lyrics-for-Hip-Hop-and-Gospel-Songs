 Yo 6 o'clock every morning you waking up yawning 
 To the sound of your alarm clock alarm 
 About an hour from now 
 You should be at the place of employment 
 Which is annoying 'cause it's so boring 
 Your co-workers are talking too loud for you to ignore them 
 It affects your occupational performance 
 You wonder why your work load is so enormous 
 Because your boss just laid off three quarters of the whole office 
 People get depressed, they get ulcers 
 From the stress that the corporate environment causes 
 Regardless of how you ultimately wanna solve this 
 Seems to me like you've got one of four choices: 
 You could take a new job offer for more chips 
 Stick it out a little longer or forfeit 
 But my advice to anybody that wants to quit 
 It'll feel much better if you say it like this: 
 (Biz Markie) 
 Take this job and shove it 
 I ain't workin here no more 
 Take this job and shove it 
 I ain't workin here no more 
 Take this job and shove it 
 I ain't workin here no more 
 Take this job, take this job, take this job and shove it 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo, if your boss is a S-O-B 
 Tell him to S-H-O-V-E the J-O-B 
 Put your middle finger up slowly 
 Put it close enough to his face so he can examine it closely 
 Say I ain't workin here no more 
 Who do you think you are? 
 Rip your apron off, throw it on the floor 
 Run to the door, to the payphone 
 Make a toll-free call 
 Tell your spouse what happened and where you are 
 So they can come and get you in the car later on 
 And help you search for a new 9 to 5 job 
 If the unemployment line ain't that long 
 You can take your time printin out W-9 forms 
 Eventually, you'll get on if you try hard enough 
 And you'll get money if you keep punchin your time card enough 
 Maybe you hate it, maybe you love it 
 But if you hate it all you gotta do is get mad and tell the boss to 
 (Biz Markie) 
 Take this job and shove it 
 I ain't workin here no more 
 Take this job and shove it 
 I ain't workin here no more 
 Take this job and shove it 
 I ain't workin here no more 
 Take this job, take this job, take this job and shove it

 Yo, some occupations are like slave gigs 
 The boss is favored and get placed in something spacious 
 While the most hated get placed in some small cubicle spaces 
 Or get thrown down in the basement, get your stapler confiscated 
 You constantly waitin for a paycheck 
 Twelve months passed by and you still ain't get paid yet 
 Here's a optimistic motto 
 If you ever late for today you could say you early for tomorrow 
 Most 9 to 5
