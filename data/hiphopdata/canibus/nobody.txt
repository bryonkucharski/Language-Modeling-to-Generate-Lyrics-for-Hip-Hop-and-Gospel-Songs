(Canibus) 
 You know this rap game is a lot like high school 
 And high school is a lot like life 
 You see in life, you got to do things to set yourself apart from your peers 
 You need to identify the qualities that separate you from those around you 
 After all, isn't that what most people spend they lives trying to accomplish? 
 Wouldn't we all want somebody, somewhere later on down 
 The line to remember the things that were different about us? 
 Don't you understand? The more you fit in, the less you're noticed 
 That's how it is, for anyone to walk through life unnoticed as if they never mattered 
 Could be a punishment worse than death, and at the same time 
 That punishment is the only way you could truly be free; 
 Free from the things you want people to remember about you 
 But also free from the things you want them to forget 
 I don't know if that freedom exists for me anymore 
 And even though I dream about what it would be like 
 It's just a dream, because I realize now more than ever 
 That I can't have my cake and eat it too, no one can 
 And as time goes on, we will always be loved by some and hated by others 
 And whether the people who talk bad about you know it or not 
 They really save you from obscurity every time they mention your name 
 You see, anytime anybody ever talks about you, either directly or indirectly 
 They put a quarter in your immortal meter 
 They keep you alive, whether they want to or not 
 They practically do the opposite of what they want to do 
 Which is forget you. I dedicate this song, to the day 
 When you motherfuckers finally figure it out 
 And the day that you bury me, and erase the memory of me 
 Here lies a man, who became forgotten to the world 
 In his search to the key for immortality 
 He never made an impact, he changed nothing 
 And his words meant nothing 
 He never contributed to the rap game; 
 He never gave you anything to talk about 
 He never existed, and he never made a difference 
 His name was Nobody!
