(Canibus) 
 I choke ghosts from my past with a rope made of ether 9 gas 
 Then I let the evil times pass 
 It's clear and only natural that niggas come at you to to trap you 
 But they will put your assassin in shackles 
 If you seek revenge, dig many graves 
 'Cause you will be betrayed a different number of ways 
 Many days are spent plotting and planning your revenge 
 But let me tell you how it's gonna end, son 
 Cold and lonely, dying slowly 
 Listening to oldies but ain't got no homeys 
 Predatorial instincts, territorial animalistics 
 Some spirits are dark and twisted 
 We all rise and decline above or below that line 
 And continue to either climb or dive 
 Killer bee collective mind back at the hive 
 Sting you a million times just for acting all shy 
 Get booted up, move up, for losing Sharpshooter 
 Cougars chasing pumas, justice is juicing guts 
 The mortars shell loosen you up, you so stiff you stuck 
 Shut the... before I put you in the trunk 
 Fifty minutes of funk, I lock, load and dunk 
 Get some. that's how you get revenge you little punk 
 But revenge is not what Canibus want 
 Canibus love Hip Hop, Canibus is done
