(Canibus) 
 I swoop from behind, chew into your spine 
 Nice as Ol'Kainry and produce another line 
 (Canibus) 
 When the God appears, let him through 
 We spit terrible decibels, that level you like September eleventh do 
 The five-bar general 
 Medals of Honor from shoulder to shoulder, salute me when I'm next to you 
 (Canibus) 
 Step into the booth, I'ma rip you in two 
 Persona, none grata, like Dennis Hopper 
 Hollywood actor, slash hip-hopper, spit proper 
 Whip a modern styled Benz with the brahmas 
 Then watch Notre-Dame Depatis, the French Opera 
 Ninety-one districts, spit sick shit 
 Trap the fish in my fishnet with this shit
