 "They don't know what they fuckin' with 
 They don't know how you bussin' 'Bis 
 They don't know how you comin' man 
 They don't know how you done this shit 
 Yo, show them how a brotha spit //" 
 (Canibus) 
 The emcee, with the N.O.T.T.Z. 
 (Canibus) 
 "Ayo, 
 Canibus'll spark it for ya, Nottz'll paint the target for ya 
 MicClub'll launch it towards ya 
 This is the beginning of the rest of my life 
 Grippin' the mic, and rippin' it right, you listen, you like 
 You dislike, you get disciplined with the pipe 
 Muzzle flashes a light that says goodbye to life 
 I'm antisocial but humble, I'll blow a hole in you 
 To get a hello from you, if that's what it comes to 
 A little camera-shy, I play the background 
 Turn the mic on, lock the cage, I attack crowds 
 Y'all niggas is just clones that rhyme 
 From a bloodline that's closer to yours than mine 
 You ignore the signs but we all divine 
 DJ's rewind, MC's distort the time 
 Sharp enough to read your mind I can hear your applause in silence 
 Y'all fuckin' with an awesome talent //" 
 (Canibus) 
 "They don't know what they fuckin' with

 "They don't know what they fuckin' with

 (Canibus) 
 "Yo, 
 You've gotta call this a comeback, I've been here for years 
 You should thank God for answering your prayers 
 The Hip Hop hero, off of Hip Hop skid row 
 I'll rip a show for a beer and a smoke 
 You know that Hip Hop flow, that got them clearing both coasts 
 For that Hip Hop show, where I appear as the host 
 Used to be the type of emcee they were scared to approach 
 Nowadays I just share what I know, spare what I don't 
 Might act like I care, but I don't 
 See, they want me to share, it's only logical they fear what I wrote 
 Forty-fives with broken handles, go off like roman candles 
 Ricocheting through your man's and you 
 They're so busy tryin' to get an ambulance for you 
 They ain't notice that a fan was hit too, planning to sue 
 They've got a lot of anger for you 
 Introduce you to the anger management crew with Canibus too 
 Switch places with the person that was banishing you 
 And start strangling you and keep strangling you //"

 Yo, 
 They don't know how to double 'Bis 
 They already would've done this shit 
 Canibus the original thumbprint 
 Five emcees, pick one quick 
 He's usually on the thumb you lift 
 (Canibus) 
 "Yo, 
 Y'all fuckin' with an awesome talent 
 I can't be silent, where's the balance? 
 I'm on some Kanye shit, waiting for my spaceship 
 Exercisin' patience, grinding for this paper 
 The universal language is love, not hatred 
 Sex, money and drugs destroyed the foundation 
 That's what I would say if I had to make a statement 
 When sex, money and drugs built this proud nation 
 Salvation without authentication 
 False pagans bought lawmakers to orchestrate how the law changes 
 We the new breed of fire-breathers 
 Inspired speeches got fans fighting in bleachers 
 They can't keep quiet neither 
 I want to team up with the best there is 
 Bless the mic and address what is, impress the kids 
 The deep life I live is shallow to sheep 
 Till I show a couple of scars, let the experience speak //"
