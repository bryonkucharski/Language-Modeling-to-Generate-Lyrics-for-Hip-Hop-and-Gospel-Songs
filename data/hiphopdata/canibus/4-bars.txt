(Intro: Killah Priest) 
 Tired of playin' with this corny-ass mothafuckas, knowI'msayin? 
 Yeah we talk shit but we can back it up, knowI'msayin? 
 We gon' bring the pain... yo fuck that! 
 Yo, yo... 
 (Killah Priest) 
 I'm the throat slitter, the .44 spitter 
 A disrespectful nigga, punch your mother and I'll fuckin' kiss her 
 Slam her body on the hook then I skin her 
 From her stomach till it shows her liver 
 In the middle of the winter, puncture heart/eyes with a splinter 
 Leave the blood dripping from her raggedy house slippers 
 (Goldie Mack) 
 I'm a tote steel nigga, a blow steel nigga 
 Fuck what you heard, I'm a Brownsville nigga 
 A straight name nigga, a straight aim nigga 
 I straight line up and just bang bang niggas 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo, I'm all work and no play, twenty four hours a day 
 The way Canibus trains makes the Green Berets look gay 
 You going to war with savages, niggas who ain't having it 
 A million Africans scalping you faggots into cabbages 
 (Elohim) 
 Basically it all illy, my 9 milli spray, have you smelling like bagushi 
 We'll be getting pussy 
 Grizzly chested, I smoke method, yapping my Isis 
 Riding the whip without a licence, I soul with the nicest 
 (King Solomon Rose) 
 It's King Solomon Rose, I swallow the flows 
 You sliding them hoes, my style invented, mercury froze 
 With gat in your nose, I ride with my foes 
 Don't try to pose, ammunition by the Rose Kartel 
 (Goldie Mack) 
 Ready to meet the words worth, you know the sickest come first 
 I think I need a nurse, talk slick, I think you need a hearse 
 I leave you murked as I watch your body feed the earth 
 Then I splurt in case the D's infiltrate my turf 
 (Bloodthirst) 
 I be B-L-double O-D T-H-I-R-S-T 
 Standin 5'8' with the great knockout 
 Once your team amped out, they be fronting like they thugged out 
 Until they see the chrome racked out 
 (King Solomon Rose) 
 Who's the first to challenge, or where's the challenge? 
 I spit a verse so powerful enough to put the Earth back in balance 
 Who's the first to kill, the first with steel 
 The first time I spit I knocked the Earth upon its axis tilt 
 (Canibus) 
 My niggas is too high to get over, too low to get under 
 Too wide to get around and too silent to puncture 
 Black gods, black bulls, rap stars that attract y'all 
 With the gravity of a collapsed star 
 (Goldie Mack) 
 I drop jewels like the Matrix, twelve of them 
 I rock shoes like nobody could take it to Hell with them 
 I'm gully, I'm the mayor, the favourite 
 Most racist, most wanted, yo I'm outrageous 
 (King Solomon Rose) 
 Yo the skies blinded, I'm high minded 
 My brain make it rain triple five storms 
 Idolize the thorn when I spit a load of clips are formed 
 Born to slash you, infinite logic, Sha salute to smasher 
 (Elohim) 
 Straight gangster, send to bang ya 
 Grab the .44 and rearrange you, fuck the hook, I'm off the hanger 
 Extreme danger, take caution 
 Cut the pie, give me the bigger portion, what I spit it awesome 
 (Bloodthirst) 
 Tossing 'em from the rooftop, pop slugs out of Rugers 
 Whatever comes towards, I'm ready for us, spill alcohol 
 For my last fam, this is war, peace to can't miss 
 I love my team more than I love my bitch 
 (Goldie Mack) 
 Just me and my bitch, just me and my clique 
 On the grind, spilling the fifth with gangster shit 
 Nigga what a gangster spit will lay you down 
 I touch my pound, violent, I shut you down 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo, I shut down my enemies with telepathy electrically 
 My verbal chemistry can kill you with esoteric energy 
 I bury motherfuckers in the cemetery for testing me 
 Yelling, 'fuck you,' with all my niggas adlibbing me 
 (Elohim) 
 Fuck you, fuck him, fuck her 
 Fuck niggas who think I sound cursed, matter of fact, fuck the whole Earth 
 I'll be blood thirstin', urban, like I'm the fucking worst 
 Ever since my motherfucking birth
