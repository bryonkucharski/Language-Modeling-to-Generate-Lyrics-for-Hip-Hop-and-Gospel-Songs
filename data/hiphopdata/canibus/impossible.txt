(Canibus) 
 The black Pope fastens the rope, slashes the GOAT 
 Drinks animal blood from my black bowl then lash from the throat 
 Remove stash from the coke, laugh, joke, smoke, pass the dro 
 The fastest will be the last to go 
 Sky watches record the speech of the jaguar priest 
 Rain wizards who control the rainforest beast 
 Bars, give me more of them, the mad warrior, Ad nauseam 
 Canibus, listen to them calling him 
 Rapid fire some lyrics like Big Pun spitting 
 Like the time I sat there and watched him eat eight chickens 
 I'm the sickest linguistically, illicit lyrical misfit, in the business 
 Still ripping, motherfucker listen 
 Microphone spray, no delay, home and away 
 I told them yesterday, "No way", I told them today 
 I heard them say, "The flow is exact, so is the track" 
 It ain't where you from, it's where you at so why you going back? 
 Ever since 'HRSMN Talk', I stomp emcees for sport 
 I rip 'em apart and never been caught 
 Intelligent thought, ah, like Masterpiece nigga 
 Massacre niggas, Mr Masterpiece with the triggers 
 You can fly away but I'ma get ya, the dogs gonna fetch ya 
 The Horse gonna put you on the stretcher 
 Capital letter, H-R-S-M-N 
 We did it before and now we the best again
