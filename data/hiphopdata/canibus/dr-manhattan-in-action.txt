The triple six devil with a double had a metal muzzle 
 Containment chamber was connected to a metal tunnel 
 Magnetically charged, tractor beam energy bars 
 The whole planet is a memory card 
 The GPS don't track, maps are abstract 
 Vehicles are autonomously Autobahn fast-tracked 
 Conditions harsh enough to make your heart stop at least once 
 Eventually you get used to it son 
 Niggaz drink hard liquor and fight 
 Gimme some water I'll be sober all night 
 I might have walked, I might have rode my bike 
 You might bark, I might bite 
 Get so excited I go into a seizure and collapse on sight 
 My loved ones will mourn me 
 Others will continue to scorn me 
 The world will mourn what I wanted to be 
 They'll regret not achieving what I wanted them to see 
 An absolutely pure Hip-Hop odyssey 
 The dark blue water, where great whites solicit and loiter 
 Then take a bite outta your boiler 
 But there's no need for greed, smile and say cheese 
 Behave, do good deeds and god will be pleased 
 Analyze the loops I wanna use, load 'em into Pro Tools 
 Go in the booth, the microphone fuse 
 Online with the Q2012 Juice Crew 
 'Bout to mix infinite bars for you 
 Hes one of the few emcees alive that's qualified 
 With field experience to speak on the quality of rhymes 
 Design and do away with the assembly line 
 Even DARPA can't deny him when he's spittin' and rhymin' 
 XG3 bold faced beat network team 
 Way above cloud screen, they scream but can't breath 
 If they kill you, they gon' hafta answer to me 
 Kofi Annan says weapons down, cease fire please 
 The Cheshire Cat stop showing teeth whenever I rap 
 "Damn man, why they beefin' like that?" 
 The year's 2050: 
 Alternative energy source sustainability will shape the next century 
 Fossil fuel drilling is outlawed, it causes a frenzy 
 The use of petroleum carries a penalty 
 They mock it till they see it turn a profit, then they forced to adopt it 
 All of a sudden they experts about it 
 Operation covert infinity 
 We must stave off any opposing subversive activity 
 Hip-Hop tough jaw, running roughshod through the dark with some tough ass Iditarod dogs 
 Coattails following a frozen cold trail 
 Because the photographer bailed there's no details 
 Real-time awareness, without clarity people get careless 
 Nobody was prepared for this 
 After the advent of wireless charging 
 All sockets no longer wanted, everything was plugged in before this 
 Back to them again: Tesla, Maxwell and Edison 
 I know what it feels like to be one of them 
 I'm from the days when a thoroughbred horse could outrun a Model T Ford on a soft-top racecourse 
 The future is now, Rip The Robot computer style 
 His voice is no longer unusually loud 
 Rip The Reptilian, Zimmerman, Rip the Zeta Reticulan 
 Branch Davidian, insectoid citizen 
 The low-hanging branch with the fruit gets picked first 
 A young boy walking on the street gets strip searched 
 Why do divine beings treat slaves so bad? 
 Why do divine beings even have slaves man?! 
 It's hard for any life-form not to take it personal 
 Knowing it can be destroyed after servitude 
 We love one-another we ain't just pretending, we love Hip-Hop that's why we keep mixing 
 We love one-another we ain't just pretending, we love Hip-Hop that's why we keep mixing 
 Now it's your turn to make a decision
