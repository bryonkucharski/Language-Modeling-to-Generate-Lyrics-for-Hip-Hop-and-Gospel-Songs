 (Canibus) 
 The secret of the ages, I illuminate with logic 
 What I speak is more than just deep; it's bottomless 
 With common sense, I'm organized like crime and mafias 
 Plus the way I rhyme is prime, like Optimus 
 A rapologist, you could sit and do the knowledge with 
 From G.E.D.'s, to degrees, from Ivy League colleges 
 I politic with any magazine columnist 
 About topics other emcee's won't even bother with 
 Rock solid shit like stones and monuments 
 It's obvious the third eye of the obelisk is watching us 
 Closely, through a microscope and a pair of binoculars 
 Ghetto scholars like me, who study street calculus 
 I utilize every letter of the Arabic alphabet 
 To touch a part of your body that makes you feel erogenous 
 (Canibus) 
 I grab the tail of a comet, follow it to the apocalypse 
 Slow it down with my retro-rockets, until I stop it 
 Rhymes be like, unidentified flying objects 
 The positive, positive, beliefs in your self-conscience 
 (Canibus) 
 From the womb to the the devolution I bring is a diagrammatic enigma 
 I'm Monad, so I'll elucidate the stimulus 
 Somebody pass my diadem 
 You probably think that it's incubus 
 Because I'm an inimical epiphany 
 This is an epistolary symphony, seriously
