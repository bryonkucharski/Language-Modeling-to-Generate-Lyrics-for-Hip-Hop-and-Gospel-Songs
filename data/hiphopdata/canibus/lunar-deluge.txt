(Intro: Canibus) 
 Lets see if you can follow this rhyme 
 Follow this rhyme with your mind 
 (Canibus) 
 I woke up into a dream, a dream that was more real than it seemed 
 With no animation or green screen 
 Human beings need special specs provided by special request 
 To see the spectacular special effects 
 If you can see what I saw or hear what I heard 
 Your ears will not need to hear the sound of my words 
 My thoughts follow my feelings that is how I think 
 The sceptics are rarely convinced, their feelings are exempt 
 What is the point of thought if you can not control the result 
 What is it worth if anything at all? 
 Where do we exist from? What do we exist for? 
 We were intelligently designed to be a resource 
 How can there be free will without the freedom to feel? 
 We pursue an illusion that isn't real 
 P-12 psychics taking red pills to produce thrills 
 Than predicting a coin toss a hundred times to prove skill 
 Telekinetic electro-genetic psyonic weapon 
 With extra-sensory perception of precognitive method 
 That's why I can rhyme with consistence 
 Indisputable evidence repeatable on the street or in studio session 
 I am sorry if you feel I am refusing your questions 
 That's not my intention, my mind is in a higher dimension 
 At these levels I have much higher attention 
 Ascension into a level of rhymin defined as divine intervention 
 My intent to present the most intensive lung splitting 
 Tongue twisting sentence ever historically recorded to present 
 But that is not the point of this lesson 
 I will continue this poetic expression, you must listen to make the connection 
 I will slow down 
 Now take a deep breath and try to get with the flow now, this is it, 
 Back to the beginning when the Milky Way first started spinning 
 Sound was the only thing living 
 The Universe was singing, signals were pinging 
 Life began to emerge from one light blinking 
 The sound stabilized it 
 The color spectrum was immediately divided by levels of brightness 
 The speed of the spin began rising 
 Gravity was created and forever affected by this 
 And thus, the elements were created in a cradle 
 Smashing against one another like balls on a pool table 
 We like to label so we give things names 
 I shook your hand and told you mine was Germaine 
 In my dream I was hoisted into a plane with a space-age frame by a giant gantry crane 
 My code name was SpitBoss, T-minus 2 seconds till liftoff 
 Let me tell you what Canibus saw: 
 I saw a world in deluge, fighting over fossil fuels and food 
 Like a bunch of god damn fools
