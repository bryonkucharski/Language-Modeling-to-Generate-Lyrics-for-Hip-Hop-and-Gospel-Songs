(Canibus) 
 Rock them the top of the head, millions of people fall victim to bloodshed 
 I leave more dead, than a nuclear warhead 
 We'll all be killed, if I turn it up full tilt 
 God knows I got this rap shit, sowed like a quilt 
 You probably wondering if I'm versatile, no question 
 My styles adapt like luxury car suspension 
 Kick the type of shit, that will blow a microphone to bits 
 If it's close enough to kiss, I'll walk away with chap lips 
 I slap in clips, and get down, to the sounds of rounds 
 Hitting niggas, and niggas hitting the ground 
 Copperfield niggas disappear like magic 
 As soon as I pull the semi-automatic out the jacket 
 I got you illing, like King-Kong was climbing your building 
 Movie directors recording me screaming, "Keep filming!" 
 They love to see me rock mics, 'cause I rock it right 
 Curious people pause, like cars at stoplights 
 'Cause it's banging in a way you wouldn't believe 
 Just to rate my tape, you gotta combine five Source Magazines 
 That's twenty-five mics total 
 I got average niggas with four mics saying that I'm immortal 
 Fatal as carbon-monoxide, I gunshot you at your backside 
 From a bullet traveling Mach Nine
