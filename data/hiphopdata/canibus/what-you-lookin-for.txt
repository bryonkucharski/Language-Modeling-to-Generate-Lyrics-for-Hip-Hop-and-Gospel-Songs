(Canibus) 
 I got this beat from Riggs, yeah I got it from Riggs 
 Cause in a minute I'ma be on top of the biz 
 Try to act like you don't know who it is 
 Around the globe there's kids that play the "Canibus Quotable Quiz" 
 It's like if you ain't a mogul they don't know who you is 
 But I'm a ogre in the biz with the vocals and libs 
 Said so much crazy shit on my last album 
 My name shut Interpol down for two hours 
 Now that's true power 
 I create what I can't counter rhyming for my anger-management counselor 
 Just listen to the vibes and blend in with the signal you getting 
 Can you hear me now? Answer the question 
 You want to talk about sick poems? I spit stones 
 Leave you split holmes, tie knots with your rib bones 
 Quick blow break off your limp wrist bones 
 Make you scream melodies in twelve different ringtones 
 I can speak Chinese, ching-chong, get off the ding-dong 
 Knock your ass over the table like little ping-pongs 
 You got balls? Bring 'em on 
 I'll smash 'em with a spiked bat like Raekwon with Cuban Linx on 
 Blink and you gone, let off more shells than shrimp farms 
 Spit raw, your face look like you smelled a stink-bomb 
 You ain't dreaming, nigga, pinch your arm 
 Canibus be spitting bars that could dislodge Kanye's jaws 
 (Chorus x2: Canibus) 
 What you looking for? We hooking off 
 Punchlines on the song through the hook and all 
 You acting like you think you too good to fall 
 You spit with a glass-jaw, get up, give it more 
 (Canibus) 
 If I was focused I could crush you 
 'Cause you saying you focused, then how come I could still touch you? 
 I bust you, then spit some Young Buck shit at you 
 'Cause I still got the heart to go bust me a head or two 
 My little arms carry big arms 
 To tickle the clit, finger keep the sink warm when I bring harm 
 I'll have a nigga screaming for his momma 
 Your body armour don't protect you from your karma 
 Come along with me, let me see what you got 
 Battle you on the spot, show you how nice you not 
 I'm the champ like Ali, you just a close copy 
 When people see you they don't know that it's not me 
 I flow 'cause I got to, the shit sound hot 'cause it's not you 
 Try to catch me but I got you 
 I got a mind that spins like belt drives 
 And when I seen Hip-Hop die I felt cries 
 But I got an idea to bring it back to life 
 Bring me back to the mic, make sure you package it right 
 I'll go all-out, pour my heart out, mix it around 
 Put my voice to these beats let it mix with the sound
