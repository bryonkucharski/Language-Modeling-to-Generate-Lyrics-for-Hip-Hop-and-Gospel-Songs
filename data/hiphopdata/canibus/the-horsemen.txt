(Canibus) 
 Round up the horses, count up the forces 
 Order the archers to burn up the forest 
 Attack from the North East, wait there and call me 
 Then on the next morning I'll send you an army 
 Do not defy me, undermine me or lie to me 
 Ask me politely, but answer me nicely 
 For I am your King, so shall it be 
 So shall I rule, bow before me 
 I've grown amongst thieves, lived amongst wolves 
 Fought amongst bulls, failed amongst fools 
 I've robbed from the rich and taken from the poor 
 I'll steal from them both, that way I'll get more 
 Sleep with many whores then see them no more 
 Oh my Lord I can't wait until tour 
 I'll march towards France, teach them to dance 
 Teach them about arts, wine and romance 
 I'll stalk them with knives, torture their minds 
 Cause them to die then run off with their wives 
 I've lived for the day, do as I may 
 Then plan my escape for the day I'm betrayed 
 (Pakman) 
 If they betrayed you, then they'll betray me 
 The PAC gobbler, rip 'em now, let 'em bleed 
 Know exactly what he need, tie his legs to the tree 
 And no, nobody else torture this little fucker but me 
 When you see me out glidin' across the fort with my horse 
 Applyin' force, recognize all of us as the boss 
 No remorse, never heard of it, all decisions - permanent 
 Problem? Call The HRSMN, niggas who love that murder shit 
 Rip limbs, take gems from wealthy or the fucked up 
 See you ride, takin' ya horse, skinny or pumped up 
 Drag you on ya own horse, stab you with ya own fork 
 Bag you on ya own fort, murdered men can't talk 
 Everyday I'ma slay a perpetrator, bury the horse 
 Body on land, now everything he rode for is lost 
 HRSMN could never die, trample niggas all the time 
 Runnin' over cowards who doubtin' the horse power 
 (Chorus x2: Canibus) 
 Swords, axes, arrows, stones 
 Haedes, Atlantis, Athens, Rome 
 Arenas, crowds, people cheer 
 The HRSMN are here! 
 (Killah Priest) 
 Raisin' my battleaxe, I'll bash ya into pieces 
 Nations for treasons and conquer their regions 
 Smash in their kingdoms and stomp on their leaders 
 Four figures of killers that's haunted by demons 
 Attacked in the season when couples are breedin' 
 Animals are feedin' and flowers are springin' 
 Babies are teethin', we come on the weekend 
 We arrived there screamin' and leave nothin' breathin' 
 These men are extremists, they kill for no reason 
 If you try to see freedom, GUARDS SEIZE 'EM! 
 Every time they cry in pain we drink wine 
 Laugh louder each time and drink more wine 
 As we toast on the MC's we roast 
 We do a rain dance and SLIT ALL THEIR THROATS 
 (Ras Kass) 
 Yeah, we slit all their throats 
 Ya boats do not float, we jet ski across moats 
 Merlin when the verbs send, spin alchemy 
 Turn lead platinum, repeat after me 
 H-R-S-M-N, no vowels 
 Disembowel ya colon/Colin Powell, throw in the towel 
 I will turn white knight/night to black day 
 Kings turn Queen, queer as Guinevere 
 Sword in the stone, split a nigga neck to the bone 
 Surely you just off with a dome 
 Let's bark these marks like Joan of Arc 
 Hold the pale horse, why his heart so dark? 
 When my head nod to the beat, it's on man 
 Transform like James Earl Jones in Conan 
 But fuck a snake I mutate to sift, feel this 
 Pimp my wenches, Pestilence did this 
 Bear skin on my back, made saggin' 
 Ain't nothin' crackin' but Dungeons and Dragons 
 Fire breathin' Mac-10s and goblins that backspin 
 Crossbow their eardrums, close their cast in 
 The Beanstalkers wieldin' the axe 
 And if the Giant is dead, we wackin' Jack then 
 (Kurupt) 
 Run through the fortress and let off the seasons 
 Beheaded and shredded in several pieces 
 First one for War, surround like jackals 
 Low key hyenas, Perseus Palmer 
 From the sand-palm and the Dark Angel glare 
 Knows what it takes, bones like branches, break 
 Can't make simple mistakes 
 The intensity, for war 
 Hit niggas like fours in multiple dystrophy 
 The unseen entity, but ready to be seen 
 When the cavern's invaded 
 Seen like film, stuck on like film 
 Beheaded niggas, fo' they stones and gems 
 Impenetrable, take his plush Timbs 
 Give 'em all the arson, engulf within 
 Touchy nigga might not see the night 
 Lookin' for The View but lost in sight 
 I got lost in flight 
 The HLH is in this bitch 
 Like Arthur and the Dark Knights 
 Nigga, I'm a HRSMN, that's all I'll be 
 Contented on gettin' chest in instantly 
 {*Missile flies, followed by explosion*}
