(Canibus) 
 Damn I'm in Nottingham, I can't believe it 
 I came from the West Indies on some emcee shit 
 I double step for clips a day 
 I train green, black, maroon and blue berets 
 I sell a dream to you, I sell the oxygen you breathe to you 
 When I'm done I make a thief of you 
 And I always share a piece of you 
 'Cause the chances are by now you're probably a meat lover too 
 Prepare for the blitzkrieg blur of the Fuhrer 
 Put my CD in your Walkman and watch it slowly stir 
 Listen to my 'Beast from the East' verse 
 If you wanna witness the world's illest rapper at work 
 Perhaps some of my earlier work, 'Music Makes Me High' 
 Uni-4-Orm and a couple of Clue tapes going berserk 
 One of the greatest rappers in the Universe 
 Literally crush you lyrically, fuck what you think of me 
 (Canibus) 
 Call the city of Nottingham, tell them I'm dropping in 
 Prepare the pussy and weed, for me as your offerings 
 I have a Rip the Jacker conference 
 Get the Queen to sponsor it and invite members of parliament 
 Ring the states, talk to Bill Gates 
 'Cause I'm obsessed with the Microsoft X-Box that microprocessed 
 I'll ask him if he's heard a hundred bars yet 
 Be psychotically complex climb on top secret documents 
 Show him that I'm not impressed and I'm not a threat 
 Tell him the album drops of October 25th 
 Fifteen pounds or fifteen hundred pence 
 'C' True Hollywood Stories from Canibus 
 Shows I'm booking them now, push me around get chucked in the mouth 
 I'll permanently fuck up your smile 
 I'm like a crook in your house or Foot and Mouth 
 On the hunt for some cows, I shouldn't be allowed to run around 
 In your town running them up, hopping out a Canibus bus 
 Fans bum rush me, am I stunning or what? 
 Canibus and Joe Buhdha bunning it up 
 Sixteen's is not enough, you need a hundred and up 
 Follow the Leader till you find Jesus 
 Let's take a moment of Silence for Aaliyah she was a diva 
 One in a million I flow brilliant 
 Bent spoons with my mind before but I never filmed it 
 You fronting if you never heard me spit ill shit 
 You lying if you said I never killed it 
 You build with wigs and stick, I build with bricks 
 Opened the seventh seal after I revealed the sixth 
 Steel the fifth, get on some Four Horsemen shit 
 My third, second and first verse metaphors are sick 
 (Canibus) 
 This is the 'Escape To Victory' 
 The Ripper is more talented than Mr. Ripley and more risky than circus gypsies 
 Born in the 50's and was ripping by the 60's 
 And still remember the first time that I removed the man's kidneys 
 With these, like a Nightmare on Elm Street dream 
 Mini machetes sharper than Wolverine's 
 Injections to the neck or suppress the screams 
 Leave clues behind for the forensics team that inspects the scene 
 Serial killing machines to the extreme 
 An all eye seeing in-theory- that being, surgically supreme MD, slash MC 
 Slash you across the cheek, and leave a gash that bleeds profusely 
 Truthfully the cut is too deep 
 And the motherfucking Rippers running loose through the streets 
 Slippery as WD40 oozing from the feet 
 Canibus and Joe Buhdah ripping the streets
