Wise speech sterilise beats with wide-range reach 
 Subsequent to the usage of such applied techniques 
 The Wonderful Wizard of Bars, of imagery beyond the stars 
 Lyrical law behind the beacon of thought 
 I'm like Igor with eagle claws ripping meat off 
 Screaming, "turn the beat off", the metaphor is a green hawk 
 That is barefoot with bear gut, black grizzly haircut 
 The barrel of the shotgun bigger than a beer mug 
 Drunk operate the iTouch with eyes shut 
 Pull a file up, try to select Can-I-Bus 
 In the struggle for survival brothers become rivals 
 Mothers become homicidal cussing at the bible 
 Microphone check one-two, who is this? 
 Universal personal trainer for lyrical fitness 
 At rehearsals spitting verbals, jumping over beats like hurdles 
 I'm here to observe you not hurt you 
 The greater and the lesser can only become better by working together 
 You'll find this out in your first semester 
 Delineating what is invading from what is escaping 
 Solutions for saving Hip Hop that are still in the making 
 As soon as I stop talking I stop producing carbon 
 Spitting indigenous verses for medicinal purposes 
 Ammonia distilled from dung fills in my lungs 
 I feel drunk, but that's where I get my skills from 
 Take water from Jordan river and share it with rippers 
 Metaphors and lyrics, that's what we call a business 
 Do or die, but I survived, who am I? 
 Alone in my room staring at the Moon, do I cry? 
 Yes I do, ain't no more tears left for you 
 I share the truth and do the best I can do ->
