(Canibus) 
 Yo, Yo 
 If I had half as many bars in gold, as I had in lyrics when I flowed 
 I'd be the richest man on the globe 
 Suckas want to know, 'Is Canibus gold?' 
 That's a stupid ass question, punk, yo is Canada cold? 
 'Bout a thousand degrees lower than liquid nitro is 
 Five-thousand degrees hotter than flamethrowers 
 I reflect light, bounce off walls and wreck mics 
 'Bout to disconnect your windpipe, cut your neck with a knife 
 Rip through, everything from tissues to blood vessels 
 My ninjitsu, kill you with the art of tenchu 
 I zigzag, zig, crushing kids 
 With G-forces violent enough to crush they ribs like pilots that fly Russian MIGs 
 Coming to punish you pigs 
 Give a ____ who you is, Canibus'll get biz 
 From the lowest point on the planet, to Mount Everest 
 I kick the illest shit, spray painting my name across the pyramids 
 The rap terrorist, Professor Emeritus 
 Forget forbidden fruit, I was eatin' what? in Genesis 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo, yo 
 I'm probably what you would call a 
 Record industry population enforcer 
 I slaughter like, a hundred rappers each quarter 
 In order to keep this sh__ in order 
 Track wack niggas down from border to border 
 Just like the stories of the hare and the tortoise 
 The rabbit was faster, but fell asleep in the forest 
 But lost, 'cause the tortoise had endurance 
 I always stay focused the longest 
 I promise I can battle any artist till they just get exhausted and forfeit 
 With actual, super-natural forces, I'm a horseman from Hell 
 Immune to the garlic water, and the crosses 
 After the last album, I went through a metamorphosis 
 And probably fired more of my niggas than Doug Morris did 
 I kicked the dead beats out, turned around and switched my whole team out 
 Now I got some banging ass beats now 
 It paid off, 'cause I came off, like Adolf 
 And I can murder any motha what? camp I concentrate on 
 With the first strike, I'm so nice 
 I can exterminate more suckas than the first Reich 
 The way I burn mics 
 I've been accused of being all hype 
 All bark, and no bite 
 Every night I got into a bar fight 
 Defending my title, 'cause niggas was like, "yo 
 Yo, I ain't feeling yo' shit" 
 And I had to beat they ass with Tae Bo 
 You read somewhere that I was wack? 
 Must have been a typo 
 Out of a grand, I got 755 votes 
 For freestyle champion, two years in a row 
 The type of rhymes I be spitting 
 Y'all suckas ain't even close 
 You wonder why I do this, I do this because I find it therapeutic 
 For all my enthusiasts that love my music 
 You're stupid; my brain's faster than Cray computers 
 With microprocessors submerged in cryogenic fluids 
 On some rude shit, I put voodoo on your two-inch 
 Tell you that you better not use it, then bootleg your new shit 
 You think that you can mess around? Prove it 
 You got a beat? Loop it 
 You got lyrics? Then flip something to it
