(Canibus) 
 Yo, 
 I radiate like plutonium rods that glow 
 Geiger-counters drum roll when I start to flow 
 Patriarch with the heart of Napoleon Bonaparte 
 Stomp across continents to conquer my art 
 I'm a millennium lyricist, Area-51 physicist 
 Rhymes hot enough to melt the wax off the turntable before the DJ even starts spinning it 
 My raps could melt the wax right off the back of Kid Icarus 
 Sharper than the shit you shank niggas with 
 Sharper than scissor tips, sharper than rings on Rza's fist 
 It's ridiculous how so many of you niggas figure that 
 Maybe we can get a name if Canibus disses us 
 I know how you niggas think 
 You figure since you already a pussy you might as well give me syphilis 
 Envious 'cause your rhymes are infinite 
 And you're lyrically limited to the little boxes you're living in 
 I'm as dangerous as they come, dangerous with or without a gun 
 I've been dangerous from day one 
 Rhyme flows explode like pyros 
 Stick to your ribs like chicken and thick gravy from Roscoe's 
 You get your head flown if you dumb in the dome 
 Or struck with some stones till you feel numb in the bones 
 You better keep your big mouth closed 
 Before I stick the muzzle of my chrome in that hole under your nose 
 Send a signal to my index and tell it to fold 
 In the direction of my wrist bones to release your soul 
 I told you to freeze, if I was you I would have froze 
 But you chose the other route and got blown full of holes 
 Pistol to your mug, cripple your tongue, rip through your lungs 
 Write your name on your tombstone scribbled in blood 
 Come on, give me a little love 
 There anybody out there that never felt one rhyme that Canibus bus'ed? 
 You a liar, liar, pants on fire 
 Watch the Goat with the ghostwriter get slaughtered by a tiger 
 Saw his video, uh, yeah 
 Smeared his career like doo-doo inside a diaper 
 My style is sicker than infected women and men 
 I'm so raw I could catch AIDS without sticking it in 
 Flip and dip like shrimps and scampi 
 Switch my language like a black kid raised by a Spanish nanny 
 To a level you could never explain 
 'Cause compared to me your brain is the size of a sand grain 
 A real pain in the ass that got smacked for saying my name 
 And now you look like a ass in pain 
 Guess what? Got 'F'-ed up 'cause you shouldn't have stood up 
 Sweeter than a handful of granulated sugar 
 Niggas running they mouth like I can't get to them 
 But watch the shit hit the fan when that cat Can pull up 
 No question, get wrecked in less than a nanosecond 
 For messing with me or my brethren 
 You can't stop aggression, you can't hold back what's destine 
 And you definitely can't coach perfection 
 Be the only nigga standing after Armageddon 
 Take a hammer and smash the stone your name was etched in 
 Then I'll announce that I'm running for the new election 
 Anybody with an objection gets the death-sentence 
 Death by lethal-injection, death by being beheaded 
 Death by getting shot with a weapon, but if you want to be remembered 
 Then death by getting your head severed is an honorable way to end it 
 Yo, 
 If I said it once, I say it a thousand times 
 I've got thousands of rhymes, the rechargeable alkaline kind 
 You want a piece of mine? Fine, we can take it outside 
 Otherwise your wasting your time 
 'Cause I'm gonna shine past the one-triple-nine 
 Niggas gamble and damage their eyes 
 Going blind trying to keep up with these lyrical lines 
 Type of nigga you can't flow behind without a dope rhyme 
 Mess around and get clothes-lined till you nose-dive 
 We can rhyme fair-and-square or fair in a sphere 
 Anyplace, anywhere y'all niggas ain't got a prayer 
 'Cause Doomsday is near, faggot niggas is scared 
 They stand and stare as I appear upon a cushion of air 
 With a long-white beard flaming 
 Hot enough to sunburn Satan 
 Hotter than white people taking vacation 
 Out in Virginia, out in the sun baking 
 Sun baking in gamma-ray radiation till they skin color look Cajun 
 Mother-fuckers start aging till the point where they faces shrivel up like raisins 
 And they become cancer patients 
 This is how we do it when we chilling in the V-A 
 Can-I-Bus getting busy on the P-A 
 System, yeah, I get in 'em 
 With a lyrical algorithm liable to kill 'em 
 My style will get in 'em, way up in 'em 
 Face don't belong on the Source, it should be on the Shroud of Turin for certain 
 Grab mics and murder shit 
 As wicked as Satan worshippers going to Catholic Church services 
 You heard of this new lyrical verbalist 
 Yo, yo, yo, 
 I kick a verse at six hundred and sixty-six megahertz 
 Make lightening flash across the sky every time I curse 
 Six hundred and sixty-six flashes 
 Give out six hundred and sixty-six lashes 
 To the backs of six hundred and sixty-six Masters of Ceremony has-beens 
 Put a crown of thorns on whoever the king of rap is 
 If he's a Catholic I'll nail him to a crucifix 
 Then I'll beat him till he's blackish-blueish 
 Then perform acupuncture with six hundred and sixty-six toothpicks 
 Beat him with two whips with pieces of broken glass glued to it 
 Your whole crew get spayed and neutered 
 As soon as I aim and shoot it you get slayed with bullets 
 Your armored cars and your Kevlar vests is useless 
 I'm going to hit all of you pussies like group sex
