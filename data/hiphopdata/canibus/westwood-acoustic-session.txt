(Canibus) 
 Who write the song, I write the song 
 Rhymes accelerate through the cyclotrons in nine microns 
 Turn my mic on, regurgitate the windpipe bomb 
 The opposite of a black lung is a white one 
 Can-I-Bus in your face, shrapnel free concussion grenades 
 Mammalian diver reflexes, undulating under the waves 
 Got something to say come to the cave, stick your head in 
 I'll bring a new meaning to the phrase dead end 
 A totally tumultuous tragedy, you battle me? 
 I'll perform rhinoplasty with surgical savagery 
 Wield the axe with more gravity than Agassi 
 Crack your teeth till you mouth sounds like a tambourine 
 You think I'm over rated? I'm nauseated 
 I'm the living creation of the equation Minkovski formulated 
 With an automated overbite 
 Swift as a canard wing shin den prototype, when I'm holding the mic 
 Who write the song? 
 (Canibus) 
 The human barometer 
 It's illogical and preposterous, they don't believe in my preponderance 
 I arm wrestle servos 
 Calculate the distance between worlds through worm holes 
 To escape when the earth blows 
 (Canibus) 
 I'll fry your ass, recycle your biomass 
 You never seen lyrics fly so fast 
 Canibus from the carnivorous phylum class 
 Wherever hyenas cry, the lions laugh
