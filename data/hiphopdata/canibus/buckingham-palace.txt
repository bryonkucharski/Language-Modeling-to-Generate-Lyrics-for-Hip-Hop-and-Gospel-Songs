(Canibus) 
 Aiyo I stand outside the gates of Buckingham Palace selling reefer, 
 Puffing the chalice with the Beefeaters 
 Getting so high that whenever I drop shit 
 It'll land on the window of your aeroplane cockpit 
 Canibus with the hot shit, "Crazy I. Click" 
 Niggaz is bloody idiots thinking that they can stop this 
 I'll increase my strength, to a super human extent 
 Nigga your rhyme ain't worth sixpence 
 And if you can hear, smell, see, touch, and taste 
 Then you don't need six senses to feel me punch you in the face 
 From Brixton, to Clapham Common, my lyrics invade Europe 
 Like Joseph Stalin, and murder niggaz for rhyming 
 Spitting fire, with gasoline for saliva 
 As drunk as Lady Diana's driver wit reporters behind her 
 Alcohol in the hands of a minor 
 I got you panicking like bombs, with 30 second timers 
 Clear the building, evacuate women and children 
 Fuck what you feeling nigga, I came here to kill them 
 Straight shitting, from New York to Great Britain 
 And when we do shows we make the Queen pay admission, what! 
 Chorus: Canibus (and crowd) 
 When I say "Can-I" you say "Bus" 
 Can-I (BUS!) Can-I (BUS!) 
 Yo, when I say "Can-I" you say "Bus" 
 Can-I (BUS!) Can-I (BUS!) 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo... yo... 
 Yo prepare for the worst This next verse is the face of death 
 Me without lyrics is like a porn flick without sex 
 Illmatic, my lyrical skills are Jurassic 
 With more flavour then Skittles when I'm digitally mastered 
 I go off like a cannon and blow up the planet 
 With "No Fear", like them clothes white boys be wearing 
 I'm tougher than denim, lethal like venomous snake bites 
 The marijuana makes my eyes bright red like brake lights 
 There ain't a party I couldn't rock, believe that 
 There ain't a microphone brave enough to give me feedback 
 I'm strong, my word is Bond like James 
 Niggaz be trying to test, but they 'week' like seven days 
 MC's run away when I kick it; they act so chicken 
 They should come with a large drink and a biscuit 
 My style's radioactive, massive atomic 
 I plan to push the Earth in front of Halley's Comet 
 Breaking the "Facts of Life" down like Tudy, I'm raw like sushi 
 With more "Vocab", than three fucking Fugees 
 So recognize or be hospitalized 
 Cause lyrically on a scale of one to ten I'm twenty-five 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo, yo, a little bit of weed and some Hennessey 
 Got me ready to set it with kinetic energy 
 See I need much more energy then my enemies 
 If I wanna make more Bill's then Bellamy 
 So I could be on MTV with women constantly 
 Telling me I resemble Billy Dee 
 I make fly rhymes to get my name on the scene 
 Then when I'm on the scene I do shows to get the green 
 Then I take the green, buy a automobile machine 
 For that thing on page 43 in Jet Magazine 
 Canibus is the ultimate executioner's dream 
 Swinging the guillotine, 
 Cause whenever the head is severed from the human body with a sharp enough weapon 
 The brain remains conscious for ten seconds 
 Long enough for me to give you one last message 
 And when you get to Hell you can tell Lucifer I said it 
 Don't ever get it confused, fucking with Canibus 
 The human Rubik's Cube like you got something to prove 
 Yo, whoever grabs the mic after me will get booed 
 Get everything in the club thrown at you and your crew 
 From Moet bottles to bar stools, fruits and foods 
 You got a album out, you get hit with your CD too 
 Running outside, crying, lying, denying 
 That you ain't The Gay Rapper, but you got fucked by him 
 What's the difference? Y'all niggaz still ain't in lyrical fitness 
 Too busy mixing your business with your bitches 
 While I be in the lab composing forbidden scriptures 
 So wicked I got, Satan ejaculating on his fingers 
 Like Dirk Diggler, in the middle of 'Boogie Nights' 
 Sniffing white, living the hype, he ruined his life 
 But I'm a MC of a different type, yeah that's right 
 Make sure your shit is tight, or I'ma snatch your mic, nigga!
