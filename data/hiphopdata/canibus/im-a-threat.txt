(Chrous x2: Dylan Dilinjah) 
 Now all you respect me because I'm a threat 
 You sleeping and you slept till you see infrared 
 Now when the gun starts you hope for my set 
 You should be worried because I'm coming for your neck 
 (Canibus (Dylan Dilinjah)) 
 Yo, big black and burly my buzz cut curly 
 Spend a weekend at Bernies with me and a 30-30 
 Shot group not tight, I readjusted the sight 
 On the Dillinger, spin cylinders and bust the pipe 
 Garrison personnel up in the Hamburger Hill Hotel 
 I roll an L and call Dylan's cell (Ayo Wha'gwan, who dis?) 
 I'm in the backyard shooting beer bottles off bricks 
 Now the shot group tight, I readjusted the sight 
 On the Dillinger, spin cylinders and bust the pipe 
 (Well I'm drinking some rum, mix it up with chum 
 Loaded up the big gun for big fish come) 
 Pirates from the Caribbean, jankrow citizenship 
 Mercenaries on some militant shit 
 We ride modified Sea-Doos, two man crews 
 Of three dudes, shout to number one fire team too 
 (Born Sun) 
 Born Sun, I'm strapped with a homicide rap 
 My clap murder the track, do my bid and come back 
 Shark tooth thumb tacks, bullet proof tires with run flat 
 With a bellowed shell and gun claps 
 Run through Hell with hunchbacks 
 In an 18 wheeler, pictures of Jesus Christ on the mud flaps 
 Two-twos with tattoos, supernatural black jewels 
 Gazoontite gats get at you 
 In ripped jeans and chains I'm a slave to the rhythm 
 Obama is the prez but I voted for Shirley Chisholm 
 That's my word, rappers slip on my slick words 
 I eat bars, shoot metaphors and spit verbs 
 Heavyweight hardware bruises and wrist furs 
 I get pissed off, lick off and spit yearn 
 South African in the Vatican getting arrogant 
 Soundclash again, make ghost of David Rodigan
