Stars come to life like UFOs moving in the night 
 I memorize the movements of the lights 
 Stingray sharp barbed darts launch from the heart 
 Of the Sephiroth sloth that can make you bleed thoughts 
 So be advised, my rhymes override the mind 
 But you'll be fine after average recovery time 
 I'm heavyweight slim face, I breath when the wind breaks 
 Breast plates move when I give chase 
 Jumped the boundary like Space Jam, wait till I get up in your base camp 
 You gonna have to face the champ 
 Roman shield is composed of a rose coloured stone 
 My sword is honed from Red Dragon's rib bones 
 The bow is quietly cocked, watch, I'm a take the shot 
 If the target ever stands in one spot
