Yeah, every man see him 'Sail to Byzantium' 
 For those that can't see him, they lost man leave him 
 Transparent transceiver, no hand lever 
 On the hand receiver, the signal gets weaker 
 Sales of street polymer gels that form hardened shells that repel 
 Interrogative drills in the torture cell 
 Sounds like Hell, not exactly 
 Rap for me, this human's cavity interacts with me 
 Blood, liver, and lungs, external viscera thugs 
 Cutting me up with glitter covered gloves 
 I ran out the building, ran to the building where I parked 
 Why my children not in the car?! 
 I am not unravelling, I am calm, 
 I'm staying at Bigelow Arkansas obeying the law, playing GRAW 
 They ask questions with Russian like aggression 
 From the on screen projector, what is your intention? 
 Moratorium? I got four of them, meet me in the auditorium 
 I'ma show you how to talk to them 
 Right handed MC, used to be lefty 
 Wind direction don't effect me, my spotter corrects me 
 Open the eyelid, check behind him like crazy Ivan 
 On the coastliner, Psilocybin, crazy rhyming 
 With third Density binding, galactic plane timing 
 The Pleistocene is rising, I cannot describe it 
 Lavatory tidy and quaint, brand new paint 
 Laboratory, huge, sprawling, brand new warheads 
 Space grunts line up face front 
 Base jump into the waste dump, complete Phase 1! 
 Bone shards scattered all over the boneyard 
 We low crawl paying no attention to our nose at all 
 I see the beast pupil size increase 
 Seen it grab somebody off the street, bite and release 
 I decrease my silhouette, try to lay flat 
 Zero in where the chest and the neck intersect 
 Take a breath than hold it, but only for a moment 
 Stay focused or your first one'll be your last soldier 
 Woke up in the Infirmary, here's your papers 
 Thank you for your service, young man, see you later 
 Cardboard papers signs 
 "I will eat rhymes three times a day if you could only spare me a dime" 
 Real Hip Hop spitting, that's how I'm living 
 I mount my weapon like I mount my women 
 Intercept correct beats, sleep search collect and keep 
 I like it let's meet next week 
 The mind of a weirdo, it's not really clear where he goes 
 Nobody here really knows... 
 Everybody wanna ask questions, don't pay attention to the messenger 
 Listen to the message!
