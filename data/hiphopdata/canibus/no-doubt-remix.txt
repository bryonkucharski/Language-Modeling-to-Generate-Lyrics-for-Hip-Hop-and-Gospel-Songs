(Canibus) 
 Yo 
 Seven O two, remix 
 Three chicks, brothers is dying to be with 
 But I need chips so I can reinvest in a whip 
 Then I'll add another six cylinders to my V six 
 And pick you up in the V twelve, SL 
 Much better acceleration now, can't you tell? 
 Canibus is the name, can't you smell 
 Spitting game you can't rebel 
 And lower your defensive (A) 
 (Canibus) 
 Come on, you can't ignore that your feeling so strong 
 You even told me you don't want to be alone, anymore 
 But as soon I close the door, you start saying no 
 You ain't sure, then what you come home with me for? 
 Girls be getting me bored, asking me if I know the Lord 
 Like all I want to do is get in their drawers 
 (B) The Motown man, this is how we get down man
