First things first man, you fucking with the worst 
 You better bring an ice pack when I see you in person 
 And I'ma bring an Arsenol, ask Joe who the fuck he talking to 
 He the softest nigga in the group 
 Blood thicker than water, wash it off after the Slaughter 
 Green Hornets, black microphone marauders on set 
 Break necks without breaking a sweat 
 People wanna see mic wreck, you wanna Tweet texts 
 I am Hip Hop's Ron Artest, the bars I said 
 Off with they head, everybody I gon' dead 
 Who they got, Kid Vicish? You wanna piece of me? 
 One day we gonna see who's the better emcee 
 What a tangled web you weave 
 I'm the only emcee the whole world'll ever need 
 Agreed, you drunk or high? Doesn't make a difference when you die 
 Couldn't tell you what wasn't on his mind 
 Saying you the best and not proving it, proves less 
 Disrespectful piece of shit, I'm coming for you next 
 Malcolm XoX showing contempt instead of showing respect 
 That proves his stress, jabs don't connect 
 Leave his face like Jonah Hex, ice pack cold and pressed 
 Internet snitching like a little bitch 
 Joey lowlife, living off rice and goat tripe 
 He boasts on the mic, then he posts on the site 
 Then exposed his whole life for the dope, for a price 
 Don't rep the culture right, sold his soul for the hype 
 Got known overnight for niggas fucking his wife 
 Got bust in the eyesight and still wouldn't fight 
 Bare hands to the gun, to the knife, you a gutless type 
 I'ma show you what your guts look like 
 You're a disgrace to Jersey, you suck on the mic 
 You and 5'9" is like two moist buttwipes 
 Walking around all uptight, buzzing in the club all night 
 Two drunken mics hollering, "Thug Life" 
 You 'bout as bright as a broken floodlight 
 Can-I-Bus you in the head with a bottle of Bud Light 
 One love love, one life, one shot, one kill gunfight 
 Joey Cupcakes Budden got a bear cub bite 
 I am hip hops ron artest 
 What I
