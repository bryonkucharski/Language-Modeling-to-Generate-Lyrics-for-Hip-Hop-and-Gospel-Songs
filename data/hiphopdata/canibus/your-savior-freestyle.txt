(Canibus) 
 Yeah, MicClub 
 Yo 
 We got off to a cold start, let me warm shit up 
 You're now listening to Can-I-Bus 
 Why would you do that? Your view too black 
 You must have smoked something I used to call Pool Hall crack 
 Put a suit on you, you still look wack 
 Somewhere giving orders from confined quarters, handcuffed to a fag 
 Played the street too much, should have been in a lab 
 Now you sad, mad at who you was fussing with last 
 Life's a bitch, ain't it? Smile, it ain't nothing to laugh 
 Rose hell at show and tell, brought a gun to your class 
 Keep the herb on the dash, 'cause I'm serving them fast 
 Classic lyrics for that ass, 'cause the purpose is cash 
 Look I got a couple of photos, of you trying to showboat 
 Before my gun bolt touch your throat, don't talk 
 The microphone shark, tear your bones apart 
 Spread you over your background like bogus art 
 Put the Mots in Art, try to focus on the frozen dart 
 Cold and dark, as a cobra's heart 
 I drink the absinthe raw, no chaser 
 Madness follows me like investigators after Al-Qaeda 
 The metaphor maker, voice like Lord Vader 
 If you love Hip-Hop, I am your savior 
 Rip your mix tape up, and still take a pay cut 
 Me and you in the booth, who you think is going to say something? 
 Remember in ninety-eight when I rung those bells? 
 I'm a chip off the old block, like Uncle L 
 Fuck a bootlace, I'll strap Velcro up 
 Niggas had gun talk, so what? They still didn't show up 
 Fuck around with Bus on the mic, they got no luck 
 Other than that, I don't really know what
