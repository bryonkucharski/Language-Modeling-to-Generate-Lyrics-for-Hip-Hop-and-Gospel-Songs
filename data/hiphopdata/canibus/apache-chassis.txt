(Canibus) 
 A scientific division of lyricism 
 Outside the physical prism we swim in 
 They misrepresent with negative negligence 
 I was sent to monitor and develop intelligence 
 Kabbalah Math is all I have 
 My wife and child were both killed in a helicopter crash 
 Same old story, chicken noodle was corny 
 I'm Hip Hop royalty, I wore the flag on me 
 Four scars, no stars, everybody I know has gone 
 The ones I still know ain't got no jobs 
 I joined the army so I could be armed 
 Do something before they drop a bomb on your lawn 
 Yeah, it's just a song 
 A woman gets killed on the way to Wal-Mart but it's just your mom 
 I smash on a novice, smash on a soft target 
 Deep underground military base dumb smart bombing 
 In the crate chamber grand centre, raise your right hand Mister 
 Tell them you a Ripper, don't whimper 
 The judge said, "How do you plea?" 
 I replied, "Innocee in the Sea of Tranquility" 
 Cathartic starving artist, God ain't make me no promise 
 He put me in the pit with the monsters 
 Half man half lykin, born Titan boar fighting 
 That's where I swore my rites in 
 Pirate of the millennium, UAV scours the Caribbean 
 And tell me where my girlfriend went with him 
 Transportation provided on the tarmac 
 Low lighting, de-icing stealth riders on Cyprus 
 We landed in Atlantis 
 In the Canibus suite smoking cannabis for the cameras 
 Panties unseen, G-string extreme 
 V for the virtuous virgin wearing violin strings 
 W is just the V and its twin 
 In God's name who would even think such a thing 
 Canibus get busy, fuck you! 
 I've been bleeding red, white and blue since 'Krush Groove' 
 I instruct you, you may construct for those who trust you 
 But do not interrupt me in the booth 
 Send a kite up, Hurricane Germaine bite up 
 It wake up tied up, face covered with drying blood 
 Red Leader Viper, clean sweeping for the next fighter 
 Sci-D enters the cipher
