 Yo 
 Nominated for being underrated 
 We made a name for ourselves but I guess Common was the only one that made it 
 I clapped when he won his award 
 Him and Black Eyed Peas and them, we was on the same tour 
 And DMX too, you my dog for life 
 I feel you, I want to see you get yours tonight 
 Mos Def you on the screen now, following your dreams now 
 Me, you and Spike Lee used to sit and freestyle 
 I said two words, they both got bleeped out 
 If you ever need me again just reach out 
 I got poses that belong on posters 
 Pour out all my emotions and double what the gross is 
 Everybody in the box-office know the flow sick 
 I want to thank Nottz the producer that chose 'Bis 
 Mother-fuckers! 
 (Canibus) 
 I want to thank my mother 
 (I want to thank everybody for coming through and) 
 I want to thank my brother 
 (Supporting the film. 'Cause all the support was very) 
 My grandmother, my father 
 (Important. From the beginning I got fans and, you know) 
 The Father above, the most powerful 
 (What I mean, cult members that never let me) 
 You know, I'm just inebriated to be here 
 (Down from day one. I want to thank you all) 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo 
 I don't want to bite nobody's throat 
 I just want to smoke 
 Yo, pass the 'dro nigga 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo 
 I can't believe I'm sitting with Don Cheadle, Denzel and Russell Crowe, man 
 Dave Chappelle, yo, I really like the show man 
 Ice Cube, yo, we in the next row man 
 D-12, me and them struck a pose man 
 With Slim Shady, yo, this must be an omen 
 I think I'm about to go platinum, I'm explodin' 
 I'm a fool, man. What am I supposed to do, man? 
 Red and Meth, 'How High' part two, man 
 Bokeem Woodbine bump me in his hood all the time 
 I want to say, 'Peace, I'm a fan of yours bro 
 I seen Hov on 100 Forbo 
 At the Cannes Film Festival with Sofia Copp (ola) 
 And Scarlett Johansson, she was with her man-friend 
 'Lost in Translation', number one smash hit 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo 
 I'm in the game now 
 I ran eight miles 
 I ain't the same old nigga with the same style 
 The lifestyle of Germaine is my brainchild 
 Germaine is really like the black John Wayne 
 Or James Caan negotiating some rhymes for the don 
 I ain't seen my niggas in so long 
 We did a short film, '4, 3, 2, 1' 
 It was hot back then when it was new, but 
 I did this other film 'Gone Till November' 
 Me and Wyclef was in the trenches together 
 I did a big movie with him, he put me on soundtracks 
 Back then I didn't understand the music business 
 Every agent found it hard to find me 
 In the back woods of Holly, rehearsing my hobby 
 Shout out to R-O-C and State Property 
 I was inside the beast, shout out to DMP 
 Peace! 
 (Canibus) 
 Yeah, 
 Killah Ki, Shot, Black-N-Deckah, my nigga Star, Nottz. 
 Yeah, stick 'em, 
 What, 
 Yeah, just sic 'em, 
 Throw shots, 
 Spread out your face like Botox!
