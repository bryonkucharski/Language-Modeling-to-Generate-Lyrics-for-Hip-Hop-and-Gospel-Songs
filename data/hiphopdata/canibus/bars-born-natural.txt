(Canibus) 
 I rip up your bones in a funeral home 
 I'ma find you, whatever computer you on 
 I'm Rip the Jacker, superego rip rappers 
 Mix match the code name Squid Chatter 
 Yeah you on my dick, but it don't matter 
 I swim in a shark tank and feed off rappers 
 Animals in a shed on a Moor bed 
 With four legs and a horse head, we are all dead 
 "Is anybody out there" 
 (Canibus) 
 I'm your godfather's friend, gifted with the pen since ten 
 Stop, rewind, I'm going over it again 
 I rhyme from a place within, the voice pulsates 
 Every living thing listening to me sing 
 You wanna rhyme spit it, you wanna die, start digging 
 Now's not the time for religion 
 Car's ride by with the booming systems 
 I don't give a fuck if it's broke, I fix it 
 I don't give a fuck what you wrote, I mix it 
 Asleep in the bread aisle eating some biscuits 
 Maronite microphone carved out of alien stone 
 Look Mom, no hands, it just floats 
 Maronite microphone carved out of alien stone 
 Look Mom, no hands, it just floats 
 Yeah now how y'all feel out there 
 Hip Hop is here, Hip Hop is everywhere, yeah
