(Canibus) 
 Yo. iron Lionheart spit darts 
 Catch five in the dark, even if my timing is off 
 The moment of truth, pitch black eyes in the booth 
 K-Tone, this is for you 
 The rasta man was shocked Selassie Eye did not have dreadlocks 
 People cursed and said, "Blood clot" 
 I roam with the greatest, smoke with the natives 
 Produce draws I administer to my patients 
 Word are ancient, timeless statements 
 Acoustic placement behind rhymes that are ageless 
 Through acapella arrangement, I achieve theosis 
 And go wherever I choose to take it 
 Master of the Matrix. mutilate the music when I say shit 
 Marginalise everything your brain think 
 The rhymes way sick 
 Canibus and Lionhearts slayed it, they say the words were ancient
