(Canibus) 
 DJ Premier on the boards, 
 Can-I-Bus on the bars with the Lyrical Law 
 Just listen to the rhymes, don't behave cruel to be kind 
 And I'ma show you how I'm nice with mines 
 Forced to start from scratch to rhyme from the heart when I rap 
 Looking forward to not looking back 
 I spit supernatural, look out for the planet sized shrapnel 
 Rip the Jacker bout to get at you 
 Ripping: Seek and Destroy the motherfucking beat mission 
 The rugged rude boy rasta on roids tripping 
 Martial arts for the mind, Mandelbrot Hip Hop design 
 You don't understand, stop trying! 
 The Hip Hop conglomerate, we legends putting it down 
 You got to honor it, fuck the politics 
 The B-2 bomb pilot waiting for that long silence 
 Then I will diagnose with tinnitus 
 The cuneiform symbols on my uniform tell you what I been through 
 Nigga, I wish it was that simple 
 The Master Gunnery Combatant blasting mixtape assassin 
 Cptn. Cold Crush get it cracking 
 Heat it up till the bones blacken 
 My microphone double action, I grab it, switch to automatic 
 The savage spitting it rapid, I ricochet 7.62 Jacket 
 Full Metal Gold Plaque classics 
 (Chorus x2: Canibus) 
 I take it back, back to the Golden Era of Rap 
 When it was exactly that 
 Not specifically jams in the park 
 But when emcees used to talk with advanced thought
