(Canibus) 
 Aiyo Hip Hop is hectic tell Centric to send Bis 
 And if he can't bring it back send Rip 
 Canibus 'MagnifiCentric' on the offensive 
 Beats bang you in the head till it's bent and dented 
 Spit a sentence too endless to defend against it 
 One entrance no exit through the barbwire trenches 
 Cyclone wire fences fire, fuck a Second Amendment 
 They might check it like they want my attention 
 Activate all of your senses creating the template 
 On some no return address shit, like who the fuck sent this 
 I did, you don't wanna know where I live 
 The rhyme is inside your mind behind eyelids 
 I spit third eye logic, my pupil couldn't fit in your socket 
 The robot prophet with IR Optics 
 Dirty bars on the table, break three legs and a ankle 
 The fourth leg was fractured by a nine degree angle 
 (Chorus 4X: Canibus) 
 You live by the illest, you die by the illest, 
 If it's alive and it writes rhymes I can kill it 
 (Canibus) 
 I grind, I scramble, I put them both together and gramble 
 Bag up the gram, separate the samples 
 The goddamn truth this ain't nothing to dance to 
 My lyrics lynch you, give you something to hang to 
 Your fans mourn, mumbling your song 
 While the Son of Sam prepares for war 
 My hands form ram horns 
 Daddy ain't to shabby he rarely rhymes badly 
 Sadly he's not too punchy, but still jabby 
 Stick and move keep stepping, follow my reflection 
 Demolition any nigga disrespecting the profession 
 Better holster that weapon when you walk in this direction 
 Is there ever enough protection? The quintessential question 
 Unroll your maps I'ma show you where we at 
 Pull a rhyme out the burlap and murder your raps 
 You heard of that, my sandbag leak worser than that 
 The cowboy going to church with a curve in his hat 
 (Canibus) 
 Holding hands in the prayer booth Coupe '45 on the strong side 
 Dry cleaned suit, snub nose in the boot 
 Get born again to go to war again 
 Calling men, tell them start falling in 
 Hip Hop must not fall again 
 Chainsaw to the jaw, that's where I'ma cut you 
 Waterproof duffle, that's where I'ma stuff you 
 The rainforest jungle, that's where I'ma dump you 
 And God don't love you so he ain't gonna judge you 
 They tell me, "Go to Hell", I'm fire proof, fuck you 
 I trigger the explosives with an iPod Shuffle 
 Gilly suit camo, gold ammo 
 Barrel longer than a street lamppost, damn yo
