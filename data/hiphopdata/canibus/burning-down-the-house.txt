Shoot you, boot to the chin, then shoot you again 
 Hallucinogens'll make me do the stupidest things 
 You claim you illa'? Have you layin' up with pain killers 
 Slaughter more niggaz than I care to remember 
 I build and destroy like the City of Troy 
 I'ma start an empire like Fiftys boys 
 Lean on the game till it buckle, push till I bust through 
 Most of y'all remain bubble 
 Perfect rap muscle, Public Enemy half a double 
 Do the math I'm a classic rebel 
 Y'all niggaz must of missed the phone ringing, close call 
 My phone talk tear your jaw bones off 
 Burn your nose off with a charcoal mark 
 Romp like the tires on a off-road car 
 Helicopter you from the side like Tartar 
 With more chrome than car shows with old cars
