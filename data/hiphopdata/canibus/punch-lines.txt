(Hamza) 
 Canibus, Hamza! 
 Follow us into a new era 
 Where lyrical content is a MUST! 
 (Chorus: Hamza) 
 We cut microphones like, gangsters holdin' chrome 
 Like, Toto you far from home 
 Like, words spoken wrong will never help you reach excellence 
 Stop bitin like you got a speech impediment 
 When will you learn? 
 Whack lyrics and a hot beat makes your song irrelevant 
 This is not a movie 
 I'm a poet so it takes more than punchlines to move me 
 (Canibus) 
 Can-I-Bus, your favorite rap star on ice 
 What I talk on the mic make them call on Christ 
 As far as the eye can see, gaze out into the wide sea 
 Look for the island, the island is me 
 I heard Fat Joe said, I was over in Iraq 
 He said I was a soldier in lyrical combat 
 Other people slandered my name but I dodged that 
 They don't see the missing pieces my thesis provides rap 
 Under the influence, bang Bis music in a Bonneville Buick 
 I see your face, I'ma crash into it 
 Lyrically I kick ass, if you don't wanna know don't ask 
 I might do it pro bono for no cash 
 The two-handed choke from the hope 
 Turn your brain and skull to sand and salt, sprinkle you on the floor 
 I didn't wanna rap like that, but I had to 
 Cause that's what my master would do if he was asked to 
 The perfect music machine, mechanical being 
 The most lyrical digital streams the world has ever seen 
 I did, I do, I does, I am, I will be, I was 
 The same nigga you love 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo, I hope they film this shit, 'cause I'm 'bout to blaze you 
 And get it on tape too, I'm 'bout to Kay Slay you 
 Somebody gon' grab you - try to escape 
 Hold you down while I perform Capoeira on your face 
 Why you sound like that? Why you tear the mic down like that? 
 Why you sound so intense when you rap? 
 The airborne attack you can't call off 
 Breathe exhaust like a horse or a supercharged Mustang Ford 
 Drugs rain from the sky, it's like the angels want me to die 
 They push me harder 'cause they want me to try 
 A pitbull off the leash, barking speech 
 Like a bull in the pit, lifting you off your feet 
 I feel like the world's mine, I can park in the streets 
 Kick the world's illest rhyme, police officers weak 
 People laying on the concrete, exhausted from heat 
 Watchin John Kerry spit over the Michael Moore beats 
 This is a little something that my repertoire boast 
 I almost was in control of all coasts... 
 (Canibus) 
 I get advanced rhymes to quote, they all dope 
 Tote a lyrical landslide, give me all votes 
 But I can be as quiet as they want me to be 
 Cause even though they say my name, they ain't talking to me 
 They talk to magazines, they talk to MTV 
 They up on 106 on BET talking to Free 
 Big niggaz actin' tough, but they walk like they ankles is cuffed 
 Who gives a fuck if your ankles is buff 
 I can articulate, I wanna participate 
 But they trying to hold me back, a black ball number eight 
 I pick the microphone up and spark the debate 
 Ever since '98 I been a target for hate 
 Jesus Christ! My name should be G-Bus Mic 
 Even when I rip the shit, fans leave uptight 
 But I don't know if I'm right no more 
 But I don't know if I'm right no more
