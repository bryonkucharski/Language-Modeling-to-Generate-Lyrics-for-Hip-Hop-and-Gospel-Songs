We are Altered Beasts, special agents in charge of the beat 
 Pressuring emcees (I'm an Altered Beast) 
 I'm an Altered Beast, my weapon discharge in the streets 
 Canibus (I'm an Altered Beast) 
 (Canibus) 
 I spit a verse not of this Earth 
 Colder than a polar bear bath in Shishmaraf on Alaskan turf 
 Colder than the heart of a murk 
 But solid as a steel girder coming out of the dirt, I put you to work 
 Remember once upon a time not long ago I lived in the snow 
 I wore a heavy coat and hunted with stones 
 Bats, arrows and bows in a carago bowl 
 My Calico's cold the wind blow like a Metallica show 
 Two Eskimos climbing a slope, squad level communication 
 Made through musical notes, you spit a rhyme I loosen the rope 
 I can't wait till we get back to boast 
 We toast to Johnnie Walker blue label, laugh and joke 
 I was roadside ambushed with a blown off foot 
 Now both my arms is mush, blood gush, I can't push 
 I was altered in the ER with 65% of me gone 
 But Father Author 'Altered Beast' keep going 
 Pressure the emcee, artillery launch, Willy P 
 Lyrically I can bust (I'm an Altered Beast) 
 We are Altered Beasts, morbid, sordid 
 We love the fucking smell of gunpowder (I'm an Altered Beast) 
 (Canibus) 
 My fire team, fifteen depressed brothers 
 Looking at a cracked screen on a GPS blocker 
 The tripod saw gunner, screen land cover 
 I grab my bow cutter and breach the sand bunker 
 Hot sun rays beam down on the driver fiend 
 Pass the visine for my eyes, I'm a machine 
 Brap, weapon discharge in front of your head 
 Then spread into a pie wedge till everything behind you is dead 
 The Moon give off a grey light, I survey Arabian Nights 
 With red dot sights, clean my scope off with a baby wipe 
 Ready to snipe, I strike with a deadly device 
 _____ Spotted to my left, hot shells eject to the right 
 Buddy set, buddy move, I know what the enemies manoeuvres like 
 Make a foolish move and lose your life 
 You 'S' pattern like a cobra but you food for the cougar 
 I pounce on you like a panther jump over a Mini Cooper 
 *Beat change* 
 Mini gun, mini gun shooter land on the roof of commuters like a puma 
 Then rip your top open like a can of chunky tuna 
 My super bust off bars and jaws bite through ya 
 While you flapping your wings and crying like a rooster 
 I'll roast you with the Ruger, puh, pooter 
 What you gonna do huh get mad and lose son 
 I bruise your lungs, hoist you up with hooks through the tongue 
 Then pour hot Melaleuca down your ear drums 
 The Altered Beast brand you with the mark of the beast 
 Then hand you over to a warlord chief 
 For fifty pieces of silver and a nickel back of sticky 
 You a sirloin face nigga with sandbag titties 
 (Canibus) 
 My rotator cut swords, nigga buff 
 From hundred kilometre humps and hundred pound rucks 
 My back pain is back again in the form of a back strain 
 I took another ibuprofen 
 Down range, dump the four, called in air support 
 2 o'clock sharp we have an ancillary cook off 
 Explosions, didn't know where, didn't know when 
 Numbers are thin, re-recruit young boys and old men 
 Under the pine trees of Fort Bragg 
 We were given commands, instructing who to tag in black bags 
 We are focused soldiers, combat controllers 
 One eye open, flowing (I'm an Altered Beast) 
 (Canibus) 
 I cause POD crashes, massive highway damage 
 Local respondents can't manage, camera crews vocalate views 
 Ensuing more panic, commercial airliners 
 Improvise urban emergency landings, radio wave damage, 
 Glitch in scanners, fast switching channels 
 Local operators going bananas, FEMA workers screaming running like faggots 
 Just imagine how could it happen, Wall Street physical crashing 
 Now I'm about to lose my kids and my marriage 
 (Canibus) 
 They send rescue choppers and helicopter news teams out 
 Rockets turn choppers into a tree house 
 We bring bigger machines out, they bring more ghetto birds and police out 
 White grenades smoke screen the street out 
 SWAT teams and riot squads grab shields but can't see now 
 All you can see is red beams in the ground 
 You see fire trucks fucked up, stuck, too much traffic 
 Fire brigades fight to contain chemical plant hazards 
 Altered Beast nigga
