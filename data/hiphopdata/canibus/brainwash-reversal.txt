(Canibus) 
 The Universe is eternal, I am not 
 But if the Universe is Hip Hop, I am God 
 The block's still hot, your rhymes is not 
 I got niggas doing pull ups, bitches doing squats 
 The hours I spent tapping in the power of Zen 
 Go back and listen to my albums again 
 No matter what they won't allow me to win 
 It's a motherfucking conspiracy against my bloodline and my kin 
 Every time I rhyme I win 
 I got old, now I'm out of wind, I had to stop smoking broccoli again 
 I'm a fool and I got no friends 
 But this goes back to the hours I spent practicing Zen 
 I don't look back on my actions and sins 
 I take it back to where it begins and just start rapping again 
 Until the laws of quantum becomes common like eating Raman 
 Noodles with shamans and breaking bread with which doctors 
 Quick processes slip consciousness, you not impressed, 
 Don't ever let me hear you listening to such nonsense 
 'Cause he is not the best and neither is anybody I met 
 I talk to vets with a modest respect 
 I'm a star spangle 850 pound Bengal 
 Albino teen idol episode got canceled 
 Canibus, what the fuck happened? 
 How should I know? I was too busy making that Magik 
 For the above average Hip Hop addict 
 Master machine is mechanic, built to panic, roam deep in the planet 
 In 1998, Canibus changed the Hip Hop landscape, 
 All battle rap became fake 
 Because I was not embraced, even when I switched up the pace 
 How many mistakes can they make? 
 As you were, I am the lamb who will eat the hearts of man 
 The organs sizzle with grease in the pan 
 The lights dim, I grin, plug the mic in 
 (Shhh) (There He Is) (Canibus) (It's HIM) 
 I don't do interviews, I do interludes 
 Sometimes I spit a rhyme for the inner city schools 
 I talked about the fiftieth power to fifty dudes 
 Franklin food for thought, I'm the 'Man on the Moon' 
 But I'm going through the Hip Hop blues 
 'Cause every time I turn around there's negative Hip Hop news 
 I got a super group crew too, 
 We got our own world organization like U2 do 
 The bars are for you 
 Fear of a black planet, you panic, you crash landed 
 You stranded, Canibus on the back of a woolly mammoth 
 Melantonin Magik mechanics, ten thousand commandments 
 Metaphors in the form of curiform and Sanskrit 
 Click ya heels kid, you ain't from Kansas 
 You talk a lot of shit, and we want some answers 
 Oh you are from Kansas, I'll spank your antlers 
 Like Marilyn Manson in a band with Hanson 
 Going camping with Jack-o'-lantern, rap flow phantom 
 The handsome ghost of Wacko Jacko dancing 
 Hands rip till pants split, 
 I throw a acrobatic bitch up in the air, she land on my dick 
 Brainwash brain training, thought form aiming 
 Hardcore gaming, my ears are failing, the sound is fading 
 A lot of back and forth pacing, it's rap's border like horse racing 
 With horses with more legs then normal crustaceans 
 In God you trust, good luck 
 God is just another version of Satan, same organization 
 I brainwash, sandblasting skulls when I sprayed them 
 Chopp Devize and Architect is on the A list 
 Niggas don't say shit, victory close I can taste it 
 This is advanced Hip Hop training
