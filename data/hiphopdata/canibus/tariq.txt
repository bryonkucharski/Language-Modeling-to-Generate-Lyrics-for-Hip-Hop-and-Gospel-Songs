The piano sample and the vocal chorus are from the song "Sail Away Sweet Sister" by Queen: 
 (Intro: Canibus, speaking during chorus) 
 Yeah 
 Tyrique ain't here to tell his story 
 So I'mma tell it for him... 
 (Chorus, Queen sample) (2x) 
 Hey little babe your changing 
 Babe are you feeling sore 
 Ain't no use in pretending 
 Don't wanna play no more 
 (Verse One) 
 Yo, Tyrique got an older brother running the streets 
 300 large a week he moving so Tyrique hardly speak to him 
 Tyrique got a younger brother Jamal 
 Who got a full scholarship at St. John's to ball 
 His mom named Myrtive, I think that's how it sound when I heard it 
 She was on her way to church late for worship 
 She praying that he quit hustling 
 She say one day Ezekiel 23 verse 2 gonna mean somthing 
 He said, "Aight ma" but it don't mean nothing 
 She know his older brother got him into weed smuggling 
 She out of touch with him, wonder why he touch illegal substances 
 Can't believe he messing with that stuff again 
 I guess it just depends, he putting up the rent 
 Been doing it ever since, she ain't complain back then 
 Way back when, he following his heart not the Lord 
 'Cause Tyrique changed and he ain't pretending no more 
 Yo, Tyrique ain't playing, he feeling good, he feeling great 
 He got three safes with nothing but scrilla and mixtapes 
 He push weight from state to state 
 Spit great, eat food on big plates, tip Benjamin big face 
 His shipment's never late to make the deadline dates 
 No fed time, the bottom line is no mistakes 
 Tyrique phone stay ringing 
 He got twenty unconfirmed but known women that he all hitting 
 Major release 'bout to drop, he number one on the charts 
 Street teams on every block, so many features and spots 
 People say he 'bout to supersede Pac 
 Now I know Tyrique hot, but if you ask me, we always gonna need Pac 
 He just anxious for his record to drop 
 The music industry watched as it shot to the top 
 He got the hottest video on The Box 
 Major change, moms and pop show Tyrique love non-stop 
 Two o' clock in the morning the horn ring 
 Usually he never answer it, but it was his brother calling 
 He picked up the phone and started talkinh 
 But it wasn't Jamal, it was Detective Hall trying to stalk him 
 He said, "I'm on the corner, Fifth and Carson, 
 Sitting on the car garnet, your brother's in the back unconscious" 
 Tyrique said, "Who, Jamal?" Detective said, "Nah try again 
 I'm talking bout your older brother Iverson 
 If you ain't here in ten minutes I'ma ride him in 
 And if you get here, I'm still taking both you guys in" 
 Tyrique ain't know how to react 
 Detective Hall said, "I got you now my friend" and hung up the jack 
 Tyrique stuffed twenty g's in a sack, tucked the gat 
 Drove to Third and Carson, parked and called him back 
 Detective Hall said, "Where you at? 
 Yo time is paper, you waste mine I'ma make you give it back" 
 Tyrique saying to himself, "Man, fuck the bullshit 
 You got a dirty badge bitch, I'ma give you a full clip" 
 But out loud he saying, "All right man, what you wanna do 
 I'm less than two blocks from you" 
 Tyrique start to feel it was a set-up 
 Detective Hall just wouldn't let up, he pressing his luck 
 Approaching the car with his hand on his firearm 
 Tyrique calm but he wish he had a fucking firebomb 
 Just like something he wrote in a song before 
 Sweat in his palm, the feelings in his legs was gone 
 His chest was numb, his shirt was red, where he bled 
 They found Tyrique and Jamal both dead 
 One through the heart, second week on the chart, the album peaked, 
 Now he platinum in the streets, Tyrique rest in peace 
 Tyrique or Jamal could be me 
 And Tyrique or Jamal could be any up-and-coming emcee 
 (Outro: Canibus, during chorus) 
 Freaky Tah, Jam Master J, Soldier Slim, B.I.G., 
 Big L, Tupac, y'all rest in peace... 
 Just like Tyrique
