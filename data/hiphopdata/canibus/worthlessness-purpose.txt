He is the Sea Merchant who eats Sea Urchins and Sea Serpents 
 He does it to give his obvious 'Worthlessness Purpose' 
 Deep Sea searches bring his verses back up to the surface 
 Someone is brought in to interpret 
 Do not engage in conjectural with the professor 
 Just nod ya head and say Yes Sir! Here is the next verse 
 Toxicology analysis, MCs examine Bis but it's too late... 
 Nothing above ground will escape 
 The jungle will haunt you, the desert becomes you 
 Be humble, if it ever takes something from you 
 No advantage, No standard 
 Ya Tranquility is being tampered with by Canibus' masterpiece mantra 
 When albums are requested, they used to be respected 
 Only the best deserve to be the center of attention 
 Enter the legend, Hip Hop will never forget him 
 And Laser Weapons are now being tested 
 Inside this bubble composed of two poles 
 I think I can come up with a few flows, bullshit 
 Says whose knows, just another boy from the Group Home 
 Who's good at producing a few poems 
 I wonder how many MCs lives I've touched? 
 How many lives that I've protected them from? 
 More powerful public speaker low budget demeanour 
 Look like the reaper, senior Ripper information retriever 
 Slick talk or barter away your OES Charter 
 Not smarter, just thinking harder, it's truly an honour 
 Plutocracy, Kleptocracy, to be or not to be? 
 Please talk to me, I'll show you how these rhymes ought to be 
 There is not much time to decide or take sides 
 You are standing in the middle of lyrical fratricide 
 Giant tiger mosquitoes and carrion beetles biting people 
 The Mist makes it hard to see through 
 It has always been believed by those even wiser than me 
 That nobody can describe what I see 
 Reality hangs in the balance 
 The "C" of Tranquility is not a body of water it's an Island 
 A string of islands that connect like strings on a violin 
 Waking up to a dark horizon 
 My rap style will always be in its prime 
 You rhyme for yourself, I rhyme for mankind! 
 Wireless or landline? Any time 
 Grab the mic and do the damn rhyme 
 Any time. Grab the mic and do the damn rhyme.
