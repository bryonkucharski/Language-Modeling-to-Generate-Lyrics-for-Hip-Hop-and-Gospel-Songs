(Canibus) 
 I'm about eight thousand miles away from home 
 Thinking about the throne I got my eyes fixated on 
 I just put an add in The Source to cause a little controversy 
 Came from doing a concert in Jersey last Thursday 
 A kid said Eminem wanted to hurt me 
 He called my name out more than a few times and tried to embarrass me 
 His rhyme was very weak; I didn't know he had words for me, 
 I bet he's probably never even heard of me 
 Ever since I met Stan, he took it kinda personally 
 It didn't even occur to me he was involved personally 
 With Stan earlier than me, now he's perturbed at me 
 I seen him on the street last week he cursed at me 
 He told me him and D12 were gonna murder me 
 And anytime that I'm ready that he's got a verse for me 
 Damn, I didn't know he was that thirsty for me 
 I guess he ain't the only emcee that's nervous of me 
 There ain't a person in the game wit more courage than me 
 From France to Germany they call me the merchant of beef" 
 What you want yo? Red or white meet? 
 Meet me in Petty I'm with JRU and sightseeing 
 Man I got a nice feeling 
 I'm working on my fourth album and when I think about it I've had a tight career 
 Haven't I made it quite clear 
 Lyrically I'll always be right here and nobody can snatch my mic here 
 Rip the Jacker was a nightmare 
 Jack the Ripper reminds me of him and I don't really like that 
 What type of a life is that 
 It's like Anthony Hopkins giving Norman Bates a nightcap 
 Damn, I can write raps, I'm good at it ain't I? 
 Niggas call my name out, 'cause they want the mic back 
 But I raise the price so high that in fact 
 The market is collapsed and niggas don't know how to act 
 I guess the world's chaos is spinning over the raps 
 They make you sign a contract, and con you out of your tracks 
 Don't act like you don't know Bis 
 The man with the organic tongue and the golden spit 
 I left you frozen stiff 
 With malted Aluminum and molded tip 
 I'll pierce a hole through a brick, you know I can Rip 
 Gimme five, I'll show you six quicker than you can blink 
 Probably quicker than you can think 
 As quick as ink drives my rhymes are contagious like pink eye 
 The hypnotize you to dickride 
 I'm 'Illmatic' like Nas and 'Stillmatic' like Escobar 
 No I'm not still at it with ____ 
 Don't blame me, it wasn't my fault it never was 
 Before I even knew him I already had a buzz 
 But that was then and this is now 
 Bis been ripping in down since the day he came out 
 I've been there, done that, I don't even have to make a comeback 
 I move over to France where the loves at 
 Become a bureaucrat and start cutbacks 
 Create a cure for AIDS with a device that connects to the nutsack 
 Capable of altering a man's blood pattern 
 Humanitarianism will love that 
 I start a label with other acts, get a couple plaques 
 Completely cover the map before I come back 
 I wanna give Alicia Keys a kiss 
 Compose a ballad and just make her fiend for Bis 
 "I'm an extremist, when I'm on some MC shit, 
 And after this you could never not believe in Bis 
 Terry stone, UK clique, keeping it thick 
 Use my name motherfucker when you speaking to Bis
