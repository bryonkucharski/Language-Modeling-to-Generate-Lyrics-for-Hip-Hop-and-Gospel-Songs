(Canibus) 
 Yo 
 You mother fuckers is so fake, you make me want to smash your whole face 
 Hit you so hard, my hand breaks, and my shoulder dislocates 
 You ever hear the sounds your bones make when they break? 
 It's like stomping on a whole crate of porcelain plates 
 Run over your skull with a tank, rip out your guts with a shank 
 Then bite you with poisonous fangs for trying to fuck with the champ 
 Nigga you can't, and you shouldn't even try to 
 Half the square-root of my I.Q. is beyond you 
 So when you see me on the street, you better not say a mother fucking thing to me 
 'Cause nigga, you pink pussy 
 I got some live niggas with me, with trigger happy fingers of fury 
 Put one in your skully, and five in your belly 
 'Cause whenever rhymes fly, like bullets in drive bys 
 I catch them and throw them back, like Miami Jai Alai 
 I cop mine, spin counter-clockwise and shoot five 
 Three miss you, two hit you; one in the leg, one in the thigh 
 'Cause Canibus was old school before niggas was talking about jewels 
 Before engineers was using pro tools 
 Make my own rules, no matter what I flow to 
 Start a vacuum in the mic booth the way my God damn tongue moves 
 Journalist, one time 
 (Canibus) 
 I'm probably what you would call a 
 Record industry population enforcer 
 I slaughter like, a hundred rappers each quarter 
 In order to keep this shit in order 
 I track wack niggas down, from border to border 
 Just like the stories of the hare, and the tortoise 
 The rabbit was faster, but fell asleep in the forest 
 But lost, 'cause the tortoise had endurance 
 I always stay focused the longest 
 I promise I can battle any artist till they just get exhausted and forfeit 
 With actual, super-natural forces, I'm a horseman from Hell 
 Immune to the garlic water, and the crosses 
 After the last album, I went through a metamorphosis 
 And probably fired more of my niggas than Doug Morris did 
 I kicked the dead beats out, turned around and switched my whole team out 
 Now I got some banging ass beats now 
 It paid off, 'cause I came off, like Adolf 
 And I can murder any God Damn camp I concentrate on 
 With the first strike, I'm so nice 
 I can exterminate more niggas than the Third Reich 
 The way I burn mics, I've been accused of neing all hype
