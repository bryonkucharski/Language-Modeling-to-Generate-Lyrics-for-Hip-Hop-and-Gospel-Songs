(Canibus) 
 This is a new season with new rhymes for the same reason 
 The public needs it but without faith they won't believe it 
 We cursed since birth, imprisoned by these Earth demons 
 My verse is written in secret, then released in pieces 
 The sting of rejection, the sour sensation of perfection 
 It's connected to our spiritual ascension 
 Start with yourself, you are your only contender 
 The game of life has no winners, therefore we surrender 
 (Chorus: Canibus) 
 Write now! Write your thoughts down, now! Recite them out loud, now! 
 The bright light bleeds down through the dark clouds, now! 
 Right Now brothers, now! Right Now sisters, now! 
 Right Now people, now! Right Now Rippers! 
 (Canibus) 
 The rhyme is my religion, the rhythm is alive, listen 
 And bare witness, try to share my vision 
 My vision of my soul inside Sol, free the globe 
 Inside a globe with two poles, Ouroboros in my poems 
 Bestowed by a poet, what do you know and when did you know it? 
 Obey the law with its fundamentally flawed components 
 Omit this, admit this a myth 'til I spit 
 You forget how ill I get, the Ripper's 'bout to Rip, Right Now 
 Right Now
