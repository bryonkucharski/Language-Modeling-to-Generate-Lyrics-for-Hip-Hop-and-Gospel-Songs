(Canibus) 
 Yo, 
 I think fast, switch fast, quick fast, quick as 
 Immigrants say, 'No habla ingles', at border-patrol fences 
 Messing with Canibus is senseless 
 Divide my senses by six and you'll end up with triple sixes 
 And triple the digits mean triple the spirits 
 My light body to the third power will triple my lyrics 
 I'm triple the threat, I'm triple my physical flesh 
 I'm telling you, put your money on me then triple your bet 
 'Cause I won't be satisfied till I'm set 
 Till I got a triplex out in Tribeca with the skyline effect 
 Rhyming is the nine-to-five that I manipulate best 
 Eight hours of writing and memorizing a manuscript 
 Called "The Biography of Canibus" 
 Subtitled 'The Ultimate Guide for Teaching Modern Man How to Spit' 
 How to tongue twist, how to enunciate certain shit 
 How to control your breath, how to make your syllables spit 
 You niggas ain't listen to 'Bis, I kill 'em with shit 
 I'm wicked with this, I should be selling tickets to this 
 Paparazzi should probably be taking pictures of this 
 My fans in the street with signs trying to picket for this 
 Saying, "We want 'Bis! We want 'Bis! 
 We want the rapper with the illest lyrics!" 
 My dedication and my commitment's beginning-less 
 I can go four quarters or nine innings for this 
 Go twelve rounds, play two days of cricket for this 
 Lead crusades across Europe like the Christians for this 
 The notion I'm dedicated is an understatement 
 My rhymes are out of this world like the Russian space-station 
 Sneak-attack rappers, grab them and slash them 
 Chop their heads off with claws sharper than velocer raptors 
 Hunt them like Jurassic Park actors 
 But spare Samuel Jackson's life 'cause he was the only black one 
 Action packed like Shaft, the black assassin 
 Blasting the .753 backwards Magnum 
 Follow me down the road to Damascus 
 Do not follow me these madmen, popping ecstasy pills like aspirin 
 I and I come fe manifest the most high 
 Drink a gallon of cyanide and still can not die 
 Niggas want to lock the 'Chronicles of Canibus' away forever 
 And put my book of rhymes through a shredder 
 Never, I'm way too clever the way I manoeuvre 
 Beat your ass like Lennox Lewis did to David Tua 
 In front of a hundred-million pay-per-viewers your career is ruined 
 Your face will be swollen like the Benihana Buddha 
 Bring it to ya', prove you're a loser 
 Beyond the length of this rhyme you have no future 
 Pounce upon you like a puma or some wild cougars 
 In the jungle with my adrenaline juices flowing through them 
 I'ma reprogram everything that you're doing 
 Hypnotize the audience you perform in front of to start booing 
 You're stupid, you and your whole crew are extremely foolish 
 I can't cipher with you 'cause your breath is too putrid 
 Put your mic down and step away from it 
 Shut your mother fucking mouth and don't say nothing 
 You have the right to remain silent 
 Sentenced to life on Rikers Island for terrible freestyling 
 Yo, yo, 
 I heard a rumour English women make love the best 
 Is that true? 'Cause I ain't had no justice yet 
 A lot of clowns keep arguing on who the best is 
 Bite the style but can't digest it 
 Till they get karate kicked in the mouth and their teeth get ejected 
 Told you to 'Watch Who you Beef Wit' on the last record 
 Platinum teeth? I sell them for a thousand pounds apiece 
 You buy one back and you get one free 
 Put it down in the east, put it down in the west 
 Put it down on paper, put the paper down on the desk 
 In the studio is where I put it down to the test 
 It's nothing but skull-crushing pressure down at them depths 
 Throw a rough mix down, download it to disk 
 Give a copy to everybody that's down with Bis 
 Since ninety-six, the Dogg Pound remix 
 First time anybody put me down to spit 
 It's like Pak-Man don't stop 
 Till I hear my voice banging up and down the block 
 In a Magnavox with a hundred watts 
 Creating ripples in the water like aquanauts 
 Breathing through their oxygen-box 
 I belong on top of the pops not on the bottom with rocks 
 I mean, honest to God, I'm shocked, I thought the album was hot 
 I guess you can't write an infinite rhyme with a finite mind 
 That's why rhymes like mine mystify mankind 
 A lot of rappers are ahead of their time 
 But when it comes to rhymes like mine the word 'time' doesn't apply 
 You see, rhyming is the art 
 The microphone is the paintbrush responsible for getting the point across 
 The canvas is the street 
 Where the master of the ceremony paints the picture for everybody to see 
 Nobody could rhyme this fluent 
 Nobody ever did what I'm doing 
 Nobody ever spit what I'm spewing 
 I'm the illest alive and I'ma prove it 
 Plus I've got to show the people that I've got mad love for rap music 
 I bury emcees with rosary beads 
 A picture of their wife and their seeds and a picture of me 
 I'm as graceful as the left hand of Rembrandt 
 Put some instrumentals on and ask my pen to dance 
 I'm such a gentleman 
 Pull out chairs, open doors, never offend my fans 
 Unless they offend me and I lose my temper, man
