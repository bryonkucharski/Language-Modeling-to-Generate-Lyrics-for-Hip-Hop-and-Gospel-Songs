(Canibus) 
 That's right, I wreck melody, so much energy 
 Why get on the track if you can't stand next to me 
 So much energy it's a felony 
 Ya microphone memory remember me, this is your penalty 
 You can't keep up mentally, you can't rhyme intelligently 
 Do it on the track, can't do it in front of me 
 You fronting, you and your man get all psyched up like it's fight club 
 Times up, you lost, life sucks 
 So does your wife slut, got a nice cunt 
 Last night we wiped white stuff on her butt 
 True power cannot be achieved by fighting over the mic 
 You can't compete with Canibus, aight 
 If your hat's turned to the back and you rap, be prepared to scrap 
 You don't have to be scared of no strap 
 'Cause your mind overstand all that 
 Fall back or no more contact with the gods of Rap 
 Go back to the Lyrical Law lab, first of all you trash 
 You can't add all the rhymes you had 
 Your mouth is a wound and your tongue is a scab 
 This is a concept the young mind doesn't grasp 
 That old stick in the mud will put a gold bullet in the gun 
 Show you where red blood comes from 
 But that's not what you want, you want love 
 Where does that come from, define that you bum 
 One thing at a time, intertwined as one mind 
 The proto in the prime of one perpetual line 
 No evil one I can divide, no matter the times, try 
 No matter the lies that claim otherwise 
 Slumdog drug lord, guns drawn, motherfuck guns laws 
 Catch a big minigun gun charge 
 This is Lyrical Law. not lyrical war 
 This is spiritual god, get your lyrics, get your lyrics...
