(Canibus) 
 That's it's that's it automatic 
 That's it Rip The Jacker interact with this Rap shit 
 Collaboration madness yields action, action 
 Action, action, action! 
 Spectators have no patience and high expectations 
 They just see the end result, they don't know the basics 
 We old and ancient seraphim salutations 
 The octaves are active, I've mastered the Matrix 
 Musical note placement, every eight bars a tracer 
 Every sixteenth bars a laser 
 Tactical applications, deeper than the _____ 
 Thumb bases at a dozen locations 
 Dead man walking pneumonia, put that stank on ya 
 You want fame or misfortune I'ma show ya 
 Emotion manifest thoughts, thoughts are impulsive 
 Action is added on, there's an explosion 
 The fallout residue is lyrically corrosive 
 Select ya elements, side-spit with the dopest 
 That's It, Rip the Jacker on some Canibus shit 
 The magnetic shift, the planet will flip 
 That's it!
