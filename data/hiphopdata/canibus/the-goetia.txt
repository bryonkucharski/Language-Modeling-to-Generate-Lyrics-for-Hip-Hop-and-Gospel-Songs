The Goetia 
 (Intro: sample) 
 Necronomicon 
 And there is variation in the analogy of where these things have come from 
 They were created by these giants 
 They were created by watcher themselves 
 They can manifest... 
 (Hook: Canibus) 
 'Nothing to Prove', 'Nothing to Lose' 
 Can-I-Bus busting in the booth 
 Straight out the Goetia to eat you 
 This is the fire breather 
 'Nothing to Prove', 'Nothing to Lose' 
 Can-I-Bus and Mic Club busting in the booth 
 (Canibus) 
 Microphone check one-two, you know what it is 
 Can-I-Bus, still getting biz 
 With mics, gas molecules emit light 
 I bring delta T.C. squared to the fistfight 
 First I developed offence 
 Then negotiate disarmament from the other side of the fence 
 Hence, the tetrahedron is a prison for a four headed demon 
 I weaken, every time I see him 
 Fight for my freedom, under the fig tree bleeding 
 I create Hip Hop but don't need it 
 I turn my back on rap like God turned his back on Eden 
 To return like Cat Stevens 
 For those who believe it, I live it, I breathe it 
 I smash mics to pieces, that's the secret 
 I cannot fail, I rock bells 
 On the Ho Chi Minh trail to the song of the nightingale 
 Any artist, can turn a garden into a desert 
 But can he turn a desert into a garden? 
 That's where I come in, running, straight gunning 
 Ready to punish, nigga I don't budge one inch 
 Fuck it, double the budget 
 Niggas turned Hip Hop to something it wasn't 
 Made it hard to love it 
 So I come back to conquer with a monster mantra 
 My spiritual father is Swami Vivekananda 
 Rhymes promote freedom, stabilize the region 
 Think for yourselves, it's just like breathing 
 The departed Hip Hop artist regarding the condition of the carnage 
 Dead farmers I already saw it 
 Back to the army, back to Pathari, Tari 
 Back to the heartbeat, offbeat on a dark street 
 Comfy aggressive assistive training 
 Haji somewhere waiting, one minute remaining 
 Satellites counter locating, the bloodbath begins bathing 
 We both believe we're fighting Satan 
 But we both got the same god, who accepts the same sacrifice 
 Blood, tears, life 
 Fine picks and trowels are real I was holding a weapon 
 When I was overpowered, there was no album 
 Thirty minute sessions cleaning weapons, asking myself questions 
 About what happened last mission 
 Radiation isolation, I'm an asshole but I'm patient for a nurse with nice shaped tits 
 I'm a poet, my house is a palace 
 A small cavernous passage darker than the Catacombs of Paris 
 Chateau de Canibus, Saint Germaine sadomasochist 
 I don't use chains to trap a bitch 
 Don't get distracted, repeat your rap schematic 
 Over and over until it's automatic 
 My body is a machine, machines need fuel 
 Two gastro-nasal tubes feed me smoothie food 
 The recluse clearly produced 
 The abstract schematic you can use over a freshly squeezed glass of pear juice 
 Right side paralyzed above the waist 
 Below the waist the left side paralyzed, this a unique case 
 It's a challenge to rhyme great, lost weight 
 Lost sense of smell and taste, wasting away paying attention to space 
 Saying "wait!" open the gate, rusty screwers reverberate 
 Through the deserted desolate space of this purgative place 
 Grimoires of metaphor law make your skin crawl 
 'Nothing to Prove', this is lyrical law
