(Canibus) 
 Yo, yo, 
 You mother-fuckers is so fake you make me want to smash your whole face 
 Hit you so hard my hand breaks and my shoulder dislocates 
 You ever heard the sounds your bones make when they break? 
 It's like stomping on a whole crate of porcelain plates 
 Run over your skull with a tank, rip out your guts with a shank 
 Then bite you with poisonous fangs for trying to fuck with the champ 
 Nigga you can't, and you shouldn't even try to 
 Half of the square root of my IQ is beyond you 
 So when you see me in the street, nigga, you better not say a thing to me 
 'Cause, nigga, you pink pussy 
 I got some live niggas with me, with some trigger happy fingers of fury 
 Put one in your skully and five in your belly 
 'Cause whenever rhymes fly like bullets in drive-bys 
 I catch them and throw them back like Miami Jai-Alai 
 I cock mines, spin counter-clockwise and shoot five 
 Three miss you and two hit you, one in the leg, one in the thigh 
 Now you're on the floor immobilized 
 Screaming that you never wanted to die till I put one in your eye 
 'Cause Doo Wop was old school before niggas talked about jewels 
 Before engineers was using Pro Tools 
 Make my own rules no matter what I flow to 
 Start a vacuum in the mic-booth the way my mother-fucking tongue moves 
 Type of shit that make niggas disgruntled 
 Charged enough to jump to, go outside and bust their guns to 
 We the Bounce Squad outlaws, we about what we out for 
 In the beast's belly you can't have peace without wars 
 So fuck 'em all
