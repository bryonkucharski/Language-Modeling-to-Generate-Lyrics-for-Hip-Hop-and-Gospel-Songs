Goodnight... don't laugh don't cry 
 I'll never leave you 
 So just close your eyes 
 Couldn't deceive you 
 So fall deep into sleep to my lullaby 
 Canibus: 
 I recorded this in solitude 
 Probably the only opportune moment to talk to you 
 I'ma hold hands and walk with you, all of you 
 I honor you plus I got a lot of jewels to offer you 
 I know each of you got jewels to offer too 
 But only if the world knew what was possible 
 The gods and the goddesses above they watch us 
 While fallen angels make obstacles to stop us 
 Fear shuts down the evolution process 
 Chaos, that's what they want to accomplish 
 They usher in law and order through the back door 
 Start a massive war, enact marshal law 
 Nah... The real samurai stand up 
 Atomic Godzilla just fucked Japan up 
 Think about it, they say Haiti had bad luck 
 I say "man up, they leaders just abandon them" 
 What happened to the donation relief dollars? 
 I'll tell what happened they went to them leader's pockets 
 They use fear and confusion to control us 
 Tell us to donate then rob us for our emotions 
 They pretend to lead the people like Moses 
 As the Rapture approaches they escape in the commotion 
 I came to tell you that the Angels believe in you 
 They believe in me too, so I ain't gonna leave you 
 Canibus: 
 The first shall be last and last shall be first 
 That concept was here before man was on Earth 
 It's not gonna get better before it gets worse 
 And no matter what, we gotta do this light and dark work 
 I came to tell you that the angels believe in you 
 They want you to see the truth through the evil 
 They want you to know that ignorance weakens you 
 And they want us all to recognize that we are one people 
 Canibus: 
 I came to tell you that the Elohiem believe in you 
 And the righteous never have a right to deceive you 
 You've never seen me do nothing greedy or unreasonable 
 And that's 'cause I ain't ever gon' leave you 
 Canibus was put here to ride with you 
 And build our faith up to fight the impossible 
 I ain't preaching brother, I'm saying all we got is each other 
 Forget what those motherfuckers promised you 
 I love you and I honor you 
 The god honest truth is that I would do the same thing if I was you 
 Comet 911 is coming nobody saying nothing 
 But we gotta figure out what to do 
 Canibus: (overlaps chorus) 
 The first shall be last and last shall be first 
 That concept was here before man was on Earth 
 It's not gonna get better before it gets worse 
 And no matter what, we gotta do this light and dark work 
 I came to tell you that the angels believe in you 
 They want you to see the truth through the evil 
 They want you to know that ignorance weakens you 
 And they want us all to recognize that we are one people 
 Chaos, death, and destruction is near 
 I pray these words don't fall on deaf ears 
 Comet 911 is almost here 
 Do the research and find out for yourself 
 Stop waiting on somebody else to help 
 Be proactive, save yourself
