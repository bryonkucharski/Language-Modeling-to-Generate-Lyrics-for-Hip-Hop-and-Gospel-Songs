(Canibus) 
 Fraternity of the Impoverished 
 Knowledge this, knowledge this 
 The vocalist beast, knowledge like the Pope in this piece, 
 You think the ocean is deep? Fuck with me! 
 Unbelievable bars, unbeatable odds, 
 Unspeakable horrors at a unperceivable cost 
 Your unagreeable response lacks thought and human heart 
 This is Lyrical Law, it's what I make the music for 
 My prayers are simple, my forehead is layered with wrinkles 
 Because of all the hardships that I've been through 
 Symbolic Hip Hop prophet speak to your subconscious 
 Fringe politics got the public thinking the opposite 
 I'm a hypo-lyrical spontaneous alchemical 
 Elite neo-liberal child of the indigo 
 Drilling holes through the Faraday cages of your brains 
 Then I implant the arcane image of Saint Germaine 
 High lyrical exponent intelligence quotient 
 When I'm focused I can engage multiple opponents 
 But I won't if, I have no motive, "Soldier be careful, it's loaded!" 
 Verbose with emotions of psychosis 
 In case you didn't notice when I wrote it, 
 I'm spitting lyrics fitting in tighter spaces than outer-space roaches 
 A real emcee don't have to do what he don't wanna do 
 And that includes freestyling in front of you 
 It's not like something gone change, 
 It's not like the whole world gone start praising my name- I stay in my lane 
 I'd rather die by living brave then live like a slave 
 I'd rather be broke then be fake and get paid 
 These layers of physicality challenge me 
 My soul is gold and it's the only thing that's able to balance me 
 My energy body has a alchemical copy that looks godly 
 Not fat, out of shape or sloppy 
 The iller the rhymes the more that I embody 
 Vilified when real recognize real - I gets mines 
 Stand with the underdog - don't be a coward 
 Stop dickriding people for their money and power! 
 Even the American flag says 'Made in China' 
 The national debt says the US is a vagina 
 Of a black widow spider spraying blood out like a geyser 
 Why do we lose everything we fight for? 
 Fathers, mothers, sons, daughters 
 In the land of the lawless, sacrificed before Horus 
 The Inca, the Aztecs, the Mayans, were masters 
 A new beginning is coming - the irony is classic 
 The potential of life versus the potential of death 
 Either way you go through mad mental stress 
 God forbid for you, for her, or him 
 We ignored the gems now we gotta do it all again 
 We failed Hip Hop's laws and brought down shame upon our cause 
 Now we will fall upon our swords 
 The Shaman pays homage to Solomon 
 He orders them to send the witchdoctor in, then asked me to rhyme again 
 Every now and then I get retarded and spit 
 I would like to apologize to every artist I dissed 
 Everybody assumes that I wanna rhyme when I don't 
 Sometimes I just wanna chill and watch you flow 
 Mysteries of the cathedral, the dark overlords are evil 
 Ripped out the vocal cords of the people 
 I walk up to your bed side in disguise with red eyes 
 And tell you to remember these rhymes 
 This is the season of Hip Hop believe it or not, 
 I lined it up with the planet's equinox
