(Canibus) 
 When the missile is aimed to blow you out of the frame 
 Some will still remember it was done by Germaine 
 In the beginning I made lyrics, now lyrics make me 
 You're listening to Rip The Jacker II: Infinity 
 This rhyme can outlive your whole lifetime 
 Be waiting for you on the other side when you arrive 
 Surround you with a layer to the left, to the right 
 To the front to the back, with a rap and a mic 
 For satellite rappers delight, you battle for your life 
 You battle from sunrise to off white moonlight 
 The cedar wood burns, my heating is rightfully earned 
 I take you on a journey through the words 
 In the mind, hold your hand with an infinite rhyme 
 For a time I know it makes you shy, but that's fine 
 Come along with me, let me show you how hard it can be 
 To spit like the 100 Bar Beast 
 An extra large dosage of the dopeness 
 How can I be anything but focused as the spitbar soldier 
 The rhyme equity above quota 
 Sometimes I go over with more bars than the beat goes for 
 Walk around confused, listening to tunes 
 Music is my muse, Can-I-Bus this abuse? 
 Put blades to your bones like the Autobiography of Kirk Jones 
 Nah, I just work for him 
 I will be redeemed for the destruction of the Hip Hop regime 
 For how it was remembered and seen 
 Mission requires a plan, armed personnel and staff 
 But tradition demands I be a more primitive man 
 Three standard 16s; fade the record at 3:35 
 Grim reaper axe, kick to your spine 
 Pound after pound, I come stomp on your brain 
 Spit fire like I drink hot sauce from a drain 
 (Chorus x4: Canibus) 
 When the missile is aimed to blow you out of the frame 
 Some will still remember it was done by Germaine 
 (Canibus) 
 When the missile is aimed to blow you out of the frame 
 That's when you know your times up Germaine 
 Don't forget you nice, you fit the right archetype 
 Beating niggas to death and beating dead niggas to life
