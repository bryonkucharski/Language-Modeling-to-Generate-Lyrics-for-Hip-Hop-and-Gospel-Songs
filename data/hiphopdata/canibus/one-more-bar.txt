Don't you spit 'One More Bar', once barred 
 You may not stand for ten years or more are you sure? 
 Climbing the pyramid two blocks at a time 
 Till I'm face to face with Optimus Prime 
 'Bar War' rap in the Temple of Karnak 
 The wolf has no constituent need to bark back 
 Put your ear to the phone, it takes them three seconds 
 To pronounce the true casualty rosters' death tolls 
 Rocket propelled bars from a Alaska's largest national park 
 Where helicopters crash in the dark 
 The eagle was a phoenix, the phoenix is a zenith of a greater meaning 
 You are reading what I'm seeing 
 Lyrically theoretically I'm Schiaparelli 
 The meaning behind Cydonia is so interesting 
 The old man on the mountain from New Hampshire 
 Says fire, live free, or die or retire 
 C-c-cold Leopold, his whole bottom row solid gold 
 He possess all knowledge known 
 The verse I write is manufactured thermite 
 Spore bearing life forms come to life on the mic 
 Perigee and apogee, your rhymes trapped in my gravity 
 Something that we understand naturally 
 Un-improvident talking prominent Guy Fawkes armament, 
 Bomb parliament Big John was a big part of it
