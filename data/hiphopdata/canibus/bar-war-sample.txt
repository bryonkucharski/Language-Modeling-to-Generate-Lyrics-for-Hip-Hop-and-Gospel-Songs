...Like a pit bull 
 On full moon, man switch to wolf 
 Full proof verse from Hell to Turnbridge Wells 
 You never seen an emcee do it this well 
 Everyday we battle at Saint Germaine's Chapel 
 But it's practical, I'll smash you and nobody laughs at you 
 The Ripper rip you up, drag you behind the basilica 
 They find drugs, lyrics and blood, I hit you up 
 Lonely heart, vocal throwing dart oligarch 
 Creates art from an upstate New York motor park 
 And won't get off his high horse to come talk unless it's important 
 And it could cause a spark, but it's dark so he stays dormant 
 You don't want it, you just act like it 
 Your style ain't flawless you just rap like it 
 I'm level 3-A like Curtis LeMay 
 The Blackhawk bird of prey with superb taste 
 I re-inject my blood to give me a buzz 
 Then I re-inject the buzz, blow out your earplugs 
 Scrub your eardrums, suck the air out of your lungs 
 You combust in a vacuum of solar flare from the Sun 
 I walk through a gistalt of thought to the sound of a harp 
 From afar playing the notes I was taught 
 I was caught, shackled, sold, re-bought 
 Global mind forced to restart, my rhymes skipped forward 
 The HRH of time and space 
 And rhymes through the bars, my lines displace 
 Concentrate, mitigate concrete debate 
 Great, how I create what you hired me to make 
 Extrapolate, update rap at a rapid rate 
 Fans hate it 'cause I can't practice everyday 
 Numismatic treasure chest stashed in the attic 
 Spondulix in exchange for the musical magic 
 With two tablets placed on the cabinet, I wonder who will grab it? 
 If no one does, I'll have it 
 Both lobes connected, flow been perfected 
 Whatever method, select it, let's spit 
 Incredulous lyrics, the breath of life spreading through the spirit 
 Hip-Hop never knew what hit it 
 Stubby beard, chubby skin under the hair 
 I spent my wonder years carrying nothing but guns and gear 
 With a focused rap flow, tongue snap like a hybrid bow 
 My quotes end up inside your throat 
 Respect for Hip-Hop balance the Biosphere 
 But I've been there before so why go there? 
 I soar through the air, my clarity so clear 
 That my Dali Lama prayer give me cauliflower ears 
 I've been rhyming for years 
 Climbing the monastery stairs being involuntarily prepared
