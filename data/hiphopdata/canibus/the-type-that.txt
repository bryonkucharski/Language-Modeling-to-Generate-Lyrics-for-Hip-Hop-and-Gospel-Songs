(Canibus) 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh 
 You know it's all terrific 
 You know it's 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo 
 I just want to see you pump yo fist 
 I don't want to hear y'all talk no shit 
 I just want to get on stage and show the gift 
 Show the gift 
 (Canibus) 
 I'm the type of nigga that'll click-click ride with ya 
 The type of nigga that'll smoke that lah with ya 
 The type of nigga that'll bust that nine at ya 
 Spit that line at ya, kick that fire at ya 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo, 
 Ayo 
 What up god? No luck? Aww 
 You can't sell crack on the block no more 
 'Cause I pulled up, parked, rolled up, sparked 
 Dogs bark. Oh shit! Narcs! 
 I Jackie Chan up the wall and sit in the dark 
 Or go running for a jog while I spit in the park 
 My jigsaw still hard, the metaphors remain sharp 
 Give you sharp pains through your brain if you slang-box 
 Me and you in the sandbox with our hands locked 
 Get the same shit your man with the broken hand got 
 I bang Glock, I've been hot 
 Cock bang Mi Ling from Bangkok for ten baht 
 My broad with the fat ass can sit up front 
 Your broad that look like trash can sit in the trunk 
 I'ma fuck till I break off chunks 
 Break off a big chunk of skunk and take off with a blunt 
 Hit the studio, sometimes I work all day 
 Still change my voice-box oil every 3K 
 Step to the stage, throw a sign to the Deejay 
 Everybody screaming out, "Do what the weed say!" 
 (Canibus) 
 I'm the type of nigga that'll click-click ride with ya 
 The type of nigga that'll smoke that lah with ya 
 The type of nigga that'll bust that nine at ya 
 Spit that line at ya, kick that fire at ya 
 The type of nigga that'll set up shop with ya 
 The type of nigga that'll pace the block with ya 
 The type of nigga that'll pass the Glock to ya 
 Stash the rock for ya, nigga I got ya 
 (Canibus) 
 This is! 
 A hip-hop invasion 
 My stage concentration got me 'bout to blaze it when the first wave hit 
 I wanna' see 'em pump they hands like this 
 Like they never heard a jam like this 
 The world never had to share a mic Bis 
 How many cyphers I done banged like this? 
 No hype-man just a hand-mic kit 
 I approach the stage, by motorcade 
 Like in the olden days, with my own deejay 
 Smarty Jones on the microphone: They know I'ma race 
 The first heat transfer, probably blow up the place 
 When I win I start cussin', throw the dough in your face 
 You could keep it, I could get more, I know what it takes 
 In the parking lot drinkin' on drank 
 She view the videos, got me thinkin' that I'm holdin' up the wrong banks 
 No offense, I pull up to star studded events 
 In an old bucket with tints, with some of my friends 
 When I say friends I mean a couple buddies of mine 
 The Glock-nine and the double-action forty-five 
 Bend your mental 
 From the beginning to the end is connected to the beginning like infinity symbols 
 I keep it simple, don't want to offend you 
 Cause niggaz don't understand what they ain't into 
 Misunderstanding is still a form of understanding 
 But y'all niggaz don't hear me though
