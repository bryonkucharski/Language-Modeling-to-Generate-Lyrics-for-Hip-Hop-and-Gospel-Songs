She fuck 'wit the team 'cause she love her some ballers 
 Opportunity rings and I'm finna call her 
 Got a backpack 'cause I don't know where I'll be tomorrow 
 I'm blowin' up spots bitch I got heat, I used to have quaps 
 That's a quarter on the block, fuck the cops 
 That's the order from a boss, march on the court 
 House donors on the lawn, tell 'em that we miss Trayvon 
 Mean it sincerely, vision not 20/20 but I see through ya shit clearly 
 TV couldn't really impair me, fear tactics don't scare me 
 Don't need no designer clothes but I'll take them designer drugs 
 Need a different kind of love, Aladdin love Jasmine 
 Me I'd rather fly the rug 
 I just wanna smoke in peace, ride through the open streets 
 I love my city and will do court but beefs claim lives like the open sea, I still love my city, if I die, I couldn't find a better location 
 I don't go on vacation, I don't go on vacation 
 Unofficial, off the record, it's impressive, what you done to me 
 Mr. Hilton, Mr. Westend, but I fuck her like the DoubleTree 
 Lord, I am just a 2 legged dog, everything I do for my dawgs 
 Take another step and we will teach a lesson 
 Paramedics do get involved 
 Everybody in ya crew is a fraud, everybody in my crew is a boss 
 Cause everyone agree you ain't gettin' shit for free 
 Boy you gotta pay ya dues to the cause 
 All them hoes choosin' and hawkin' 
 It's my house take ya shoes when you walk in 
 And these hoes make appointments now 
 Me and my city like Christopher Walken 
 I just wanna smoke in peace, ride through the open streets 
 I love my city and will do court but beefs claim lives like the open sea, I still love my city, if I die, I couldn't find a better location 
 I don't go on vacation, I don't go on vacation 
 Vacation, my vision is so clear, my vision is so clear 
 Nigga so off couldn't hit a tee-ball 
 And you a grown nigga like 6 feet tall 
 Walked the line and he got chalked, ball so hard that he got lost 
 Look at that lead on the wall, all of my team gonna ball 
 We gon' leave 3hun of y'all, lookin' Neanderthals 
 That look like y'all 'fore a nigga evolved 
 Hope not, hit her with the dope dick and my crib's the dope spot 
 I ain't got time for appointments that don't flock 
 And bitches that come back to my crib and don't pop 
 And niggas that smoke all my shit and don't cop 
 I see you muthafuckas 
 My vision is so clear, I see you motherfuckers 
 My vision is so clear (x4)
