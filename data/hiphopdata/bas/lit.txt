Do you still believe in love? 
 Or do you like drugs? 
 Ran into a night owl rollin' White Owls 
 Girl it's been awhile since I hit a White Owl 
 I'm with it though, she a centerfold 
 Big ol' blunt look like tentacles 
 She strip in Europe, Interpol 
 Don't remember her in her clothes 
 I fucked her friend, damn they was close 
 Let's reunite, let's get 'em close 
 Hit 'em twice in a row, hit a flight, and I'm ghost 
 That's the last time I seen her though 
 She be gettin' too eager, ho 
 Stamp it like it's my visa 
 Cheefin' off of these berries 
 When the world gets heavy and it hurts to carry 
 I'm her Midnight Mercenary 
 Fiend 
 It's lit 
 Feel the buzz? 
 That's a half? 
 Shit it was 
 It's lit 
 Feel the buzz? 
 It's lit 
 Feel the buzz? 
 She take me to a place that I never would discover 
 Might never have another, so I had to fuck her 
 Reach into my pockets, damn I ain't got a rubber 
 See my nigga Ron, like L. Ron Hubbard, he be outta space 
 Say he got a case of straps at the back of the hotel cupboard 
 Room 508, check by the safe, she say "Boy you got it made 
 Do you got a cape?", I ain't with the games ma, do I gotta wait? 
 I'm quite impatient, intoxication got me feelin' like procreating 
 Girl I'm the baker, you surely caking 
 Stand back, catch my amazing graces 
 Photo finish and fornication 
 Photo finish and fornication 
 Fiend 
 It's lit 
 Feel the buzz? 
 That's a half? 
 Shit it was 
 It's lit 
 Feel the buzz? 
 It's lit 
 Feel the buzz? 
 Feel the buzz 
 Can you feel the buzz? 
 Feel the buzz 
 Do you believe in love? 
 What's your drug? 
 What's your drug? 
 Now comes the question of which intro do you use? 
 Do you use this intro or the other intro I was talkin' on? 
 But, then that let's people know I had more than one take 
 So maybe we should just not use this and use the other intro 
 So people would think I just took it straight through 
 Yeah, let's do that 
 You'd be surprised how many truths you can hide in flows 
 I'm listenin' to this beat with my eyelids closed 
 Thoughts keep flashin' and I keep laughin' 
 I never thought that I would fuck Irish hoes 
 Maybe Asian bitches or Caucasian bitches 
 Remember when I got to New York I was lost 
 Because all I ever saw was Jamaican bitches 
 I ain't barely know what Jamrock was 
 Lil' country nigga God damn I was 
 To you niggas talkin' online until you make it this high 
 Then you could never understand this buzz, well 
 Maybe if you put yourself in the shoes 
 Of a nigga comin' straight out the South 
 No gold grill just a east coast feel 
 And a set of crooked teeth in his mouth 
 Make them hoes bounce, that can't get enough 
 Niggas say I made it I ain't make it enough 
 Man hang that nigga, you a real lame ass nigga 
 If you ain't got my tape in your truck 
 Cole, uhm world don't you forget that 
 I think I lost my mind round the same time I lost my six pack 
 But no sit-ups for me, long as my dick still get up for me 
 Long as a ho still give up for me 
 She usually charge but she get us for free 
 Whoa, that's TMI, lil' something like TMZ 
 Scared of the days you'll be seeing me 
 'Cause my girl do not play, coach DNP 
 That's something for the hoop fans 
 Just copped her the coupe man 
 No drop top but a slot on the roof that can slide out 
 And get a little sun while you ride out 
 Ced on the beat let me vibe out 
 We was 15 with a ASR up in my house 
 Writin' rhymes out, momma made it happen 
 Could've been a lawyer but I made it rappin', he made it rappin' 
 Now at the shows he the main attraction 
 Another shot of Henny so I'm faded askin' 
 How long do this drug called fame be lastin' "It's lit, feel the buzz?" 
 Another shot of Henny so I'm faded askin' 
 How long do this drug called fame be lastin', that's deep 
 Feel the buzz? 
 It's lit 
 Feel the buzz? 
 Feel the buzz?
