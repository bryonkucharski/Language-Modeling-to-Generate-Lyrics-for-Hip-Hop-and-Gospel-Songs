Every day, every day, every day, every day I been chasing the truth 
 But ooh I've been waiting for you 
 Ooh I've been waiting for you 
 And I was like Looord 
 And she was like "boooy you better be smart with your ways" 
 I turn to Mike Shaw 
 And he was like dawg "I think she got the Donk Of The Day" 
 'Cause girl she got the Donk Of The Day 
 That gotta be the donk of the way 
 You know you got the donk of the day 
 That gotta be it 
 Never had a day worth planning 
 'Cause every damn day is outlandish 
 I holla that wave bandana 
 My nigga is so high outlandish 
 I said we can hit the hood spot 
 My niggas do spray they canvas 
 Or we can hit the good spot 
 But Imma have to change appearance 
 I went to buy a cardigan 
 I seen you at the mall and then 
 I could re-call again, I was on youuu and 
 My nigga was on your friend 
 They been steady two years now 
 But I never called again 
 And you ain't never fall off 
 So can I get on again 
 Breeze through the city baby 
 You would think I'm on to win 
 I think I was born to spend 
 I heard you was dancing girl 
 I think you were born to bend 
 I think I was born, born again when I found that pen mothafuckin' right 
 Every day, every day, every day, every day I been chasing the truth 
 But ooh I've been waiting for you 
 Ooh I've been waiting for you 
 And I was like Looord 
 And she was like "boooy you better be smart with your ways" 
 I turn to Mike Shaw 
 And he was like dawg "I think she got the Donk Of The Day" 
 'Cause girl she got the Donk Of The Day 
 That gotta be the donk of the way 
 You know you got the donk of the day 
 That gotta be it 
 Never had a day worth planning 
 'Cause every damn day is outlandish 
 I'm going over sees outlandish 
 A nigga so high outlandish 
 Man I'm like a fly on the wall 
 And these four walls heard it all 
 I could hit a fee line in your voice 
 But them words won't hurt at all 
 'Cause these broads gone leave till the morning 
 Champagne form bubbles in my bong 
 All I need is the love of my crew 
 Fuck you, my borough know I'm on 
 Never been to work with a briefcase 
 But I'm still in need stay?? 
 So my Momma text, and said be safe 
 So I'm from my ex and said be great 
 First thought like she fake 
 Text back like 'preciate 
 Girl be brave 
 What you want Hunna replay 
 This shit is dead like Enyce 
 Dear Nefertiti 
 I'm sure your'e a Goddess or 
 My shades are 3D 
 'Cause damn they look large, them titties 
 She always on them up is when they go down 
 All she know is turn up girl slow down 
 Slow down, girl slow down 
 Body type Maya, face more Aaliyah 
 Stack, used to run track 
 Till she tore her knee up 
 Me I'm from Queens 
 And we up, my last shit crack 
 Bitch I'm back with the re-up 
 Already caught the vibes 
 But I don't got the time 
 Girl I'm saying you should know 
 She said, "bottom line I be lying if I said I was surprised when you said you had to go 
 Met her out in France and her ass meaner 
 In them Euro hotels with the Ass Cleaners 
 Long ways from them days when we had peanuts 
 Looked back we just laugh like damn we up 
 She said let's go 
 Back to the bathroom to do some blow, Whoa 
 Said you was sprinting, you really shouldn't do that blow no more 
 Said I do what I do, it ain't enough for a vote 
 What's it to you, you don't know how I cope 
 Shit I done seen it's like ether to me 
 You don't know how I roll so you speechless to me 
 You niggas, Niggas don't get it you got it so good 
 I'm developing penis envy, Pause 
 No Venus in me, give a fuck if you niggas from Mars 
 You need to chill 
 I see the Coke in your jaw 
 You getting too aggy 
 You still got about half a gram in that baggy 
 I'm gone take care of this tab 
 And I'll probably just hail you a cabby 
 Every day, Every day, every day, every day I been chasing the truth 
 But ooh I've been waiting for you 
 Ooh I've been waiting for you
