Why you so dramatic? 
 Why you so dramatic? 
 You think I give a fuck or you talk static 
 I'm holdin' heaven it's automatic 
 You think I give a fuck or you talk static 
 I'm holdin' heaven it's automatic 
 'Cause I gotta stay fresh 
 Fiji water in my iron 
 Yeah I gotta stay fresh 
 Fiji water in my iron 
 Ho I gotta stay fresh 
 Fiji water in my iron 
 Yeah I gotta stay fresh 
 Fiji water in my iron 
 Cause each day we wake up 
 We smoke L's we make love 
 We bump Soul in your basement 
 Bump Cole in my truck 
 'Cause we ride, we ride, we ride, we ride 
 We ride, we ride, we ride, we ride 
 It's just me, you, Jack, and Ginger 
 Mary's here my dear 
 No need to ask I'll bring her pour me a glass 
 I'm in my zone 
 I'm in my zone 
 And if it's mine that's you honey 
 Stick together like new money 
 Hit Dubai on that dune buggies 
 Catch some rays like it's Tampa Bay 
 And I know what drives you crazy 
 On how I switch daily 
 From love is so amazing 
 To love is so enslaving 
 Yet all you have is patience 
 Fight for us as if life is love 
 If love is gone it's dead life in us 
 I repent all my sins 
 Always trynna put knife in us 
 I hear my devil's enticing but 
 They run amok every night 
 They love to fuck WOOP 
 They ain't nothin' but some pressure cause 
 Pressure buzz 
 Promise for the two of us, I never rush 
 It's me, you, Jack, and Ginger 
 Mary's here my dear 
 No need to ask I'll bring her, pour me a glass 
 I'm in my zone 
 'Cause I gotta stay fresh 
 Fiji water in my iron 
 Yeah I gotta stay fresh 
 Fiji water in my iron 
 Ho I gotta stay fresh 
 Fiji water in my iron 
 Yeah I gotta stay fresh 
 Fiji water in my iron 
 Cause each day we wake up 
 We smoke L's we make love 
 We bump Soul in your basement 
 Bump Cole in my truck 
 'Cause we ride, we ride, we ride, we ride 
 We ride, we ride, we ride, we ride 
 And she was like Lauryn Hill tell him 
 I was trynna be a player still on my Bill Bellamy 
 But she couldn't understand 
 Cause every time we go out we go out with a bang 
 She just want a taste 
 Fill up with regrets now you get 'em by the tags 
 Bitch you never wear the smiley face OK 
 You can tell me 'bout it or you can tell it to the A's 
 'Cause we never let it go to waste 
 Don't you ever let me go to waste 
 Black star so we couldn't burn out 
 Like black cards we ain't gettin' turned down 
 My God gon' get the word out 
 That's laughter my bitch got ass like Nasa 
 That line prolly only makes sense to me 
 That's fine I'm the shit to me 
 That's fine I'm the shit to me
