Two white girls and they both Beckys 
 Got me livin' like the nigga on the Dos Equis 
 I was born ready my first home was Paris 
 Now I roam New York where the chrome is heavy 
 Get too hyper boy that shit will have to quit 
 Have you walkin' round your crib with bags of shit some nasty shit 
 If you take the tumble come back up that happen quick 
 Got me jumpin' out the booth like did that just happen quick 
 Met her at my show damn that just happened quick 
 Arrogant nigga fuck it I could probably build a pyramid 
 Bearded like the Pharaoh but I'm Nubian truly him 
 This ain't no shallow pool boo I hope you swim, shit 
 What's your problem with me don't know how to relate 
 I'm just findin' my way so get out of my way 
 Last Winter hot bitches and cold brews 
 Old flings but oh well, they old news 
 Here I am rollin' up another bud 
 God damn higher than a muthafuck 
 Let me take you to the places you fiendin' to go 
 'Cause niggas talk about it but I seen it before 
 I seen it before 
 I seen it before 
 I see through you niggas 
 I got laser eyes 
 Don't you patronize 
 That shit don't get me 
 I am not your dawg 
 Nigga don't pet me 
 Screamin' fuck the law 'cause they won't let me 
 Let me be just let me be free 
 Smokin's Os with the fiends no sesame seeds 
 Got scholars, parolees whatever between 
 They fuckin' with me they fuck with the fiends 
 Supermonkey mutt I blow an O a day 
 These bitches latch on like a stowaway 
 She get on my last nerve I tell her go away 
 I fuck her once that bitch is a throw away 
 Here I am rollin' up another bud 
 God damn higher than a muthafuck 
 Let me take you to the places you fiendin' to go 
 'Cause niggas talk about it but I seen it before 
 I seen it before 
 I seen it before
