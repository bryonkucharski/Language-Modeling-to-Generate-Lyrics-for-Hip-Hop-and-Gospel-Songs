You say you want me Annotateto have the world (You sure?) 
 You say you want me to have the world (Are you sure?) 
 If OG got them bangers than I go forever with flows 
 On a blank canvas Bas so incredibly dope 
 Giving light to my dreams, I couldn't measure the scope 
 Turn that white into green, that's Incredible Hulk 
 Man I'm so fly I see the heavens approaching 
 The Pearl in them Gates, I'm burning a stogie, than pearling a jay 
 My memory fades, that's cool cause every day is a memory made 
 The Judge a crook he throw the book at every case 
 So we celebrate life, that's for every occasion 
 I ran out of patience, I can't be complacent 
 When niggas a take a limb and leave you with casings 
 My car, it barely start it need a new AC 
 My star ripped out my heart and told me replace it 
 My job it never call, I need me some wages 
 And you, well you, you just need me to make it 
 (Oh) You just need me to make it 
 I get it I get it I get it, you just need me to make it 
 You say you want me to have the world (Are you sure?) 
 You say you want me to have the world 
 I get it I get it I get it 
 Hit it in the mornin' or the evenin' if that pussy good 
 I'm probably never leaving love, do you still believe in love? 
 No it ain't real, Damn not even us 
 She been down so long she gotta even up 
 Nevermind my intentions, of Rari's and mentions 
 You see them hoes like it, and now you get defensive 
 You prying in my mentions, and I can feel the tension 
 You'd rather me a real job, suit ay'?, a pension 
 You feel I be a new guy as soon as it sets in 
 I feel I'm losing you bout' every second 
 Don't you get apprehensive, we served a sentence together, I know you down forever 
 Aware of what I got, I couldn't replace it 
 You want me for me, see the glory and base it 
 I love you for it, cause you can't even fake it 
 A heart on the fringe, you don't want me to make it 
 You don't want me to make it 
 You say you want me to have the world (You sure?) 
 You say you want me to have the world (Are you sure?) 
 No she frontin' 
 You say you want me to have the world 
 Nah she frontin', Oh your frontin' 
 You say you want me to have the world (Are you sure?) 
 It's you world (x20)
