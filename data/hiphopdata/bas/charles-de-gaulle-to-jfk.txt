Yeah 
 Got them speakers in my ride, I like to keep 'em bumpin' 
 I'm hustlin', chasin' dreams and hopes that I could become somethin' 
 I threw a party, she say Bassy, thank you, but it's nothin' 
 'Cause I had to keep it jumpin' 
 Ya a'int Blake Griffin, but I know that you be jumpin' 
 Poker face stiffin', but I know that you be bluffin' 
 No, I don't be cuffin', all these ducks be gettin' ends 
 Rubber duck etcaeterin', and I'm the pain 
 I left to make, and can't be ya crutch and meta... 
 Piffy lined up, fired up in the dutch 
 Of the easy lined up, wide up, six speed 
 Like clutch, the city on me, I'm clutch 
 No Worries ain't depending on me, I'm clutched 
 Toast up my most tough at thirty thousand feet 
 Henny in hand, land, can make it out my seat, Michelin man 
 Make you grip about the street 
 Grab The D cup on the freak, played that bitch and press repeat 
 J-Walkin' through time zones, I'm on that trip 
 Got yo piece of the pie, and you pawn that shit 
 I'm takin' all that shit until I own that sis 
 College shit get mind blown, I'm on that quick 
 She got expenses for Dixon and a nose that's rich 
 Nothin' betta than brown dough that's on that stick 
 A lil' hashish, shiish, baby 
 If you roll it up with some keiff 
 Super chasin paper about my lose leaf 
 Rollin' papers yeah I do chief 
 Meditatin' like I'm Bruce Lee, at the Carter like I'm Tunechi 
 Riddin' through the borough while this cutie feed me sushi 
 Salmon, avocado and an order of the cuchie 
 Charles De Gaulle To JFK 
 Brods givin' up the draws like I'm JFK 
 Guess I'm flawed, that's the roll, ain't nobody perfect 
 Do it all just to ball and the shit is worth it 
 It's like that now 
 Quick, fuck that let me get back 
 I'm in L.A. but my days got sand from Dubai 
 I'm getting brains all day like I'm Magna Cum Laude 
 'Cause, while you boys planked I was getting more stamps 
 Now my passport shitting on your whole camp 
 Fuck ya Instagram, that monkeys do delivery, that instant gram 
 Damn, put them ones up for them ones that's above us 'cause we miss them man 
 And to the niggas stuck up in the can 
 And slam a cage up in ya body put cha body up in a different plan 
 Different plain 
 Same hustle different game 
 They don't love you if they always wanted you to stay the same 
 Slidin' through the checks, now I'm slidin' the the W with different dames 
 That's a W nigga figure that shit is game 
 I just keep doubling figures until my niggas ain't 
 Pedelin' pills and kaine 
 'Cause in the streets, of the industry man them presidents is still the same 
 Them presidents still the same 
 I get that green back 
 I see stacks and relapse 
 Fiend Bas, I mean that
