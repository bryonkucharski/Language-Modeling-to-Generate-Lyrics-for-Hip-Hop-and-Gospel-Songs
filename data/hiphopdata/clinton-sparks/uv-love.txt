(Verse 1: Clinton Sparks) 
 Hey girl, what you do? 
 Yeah, you knocked me down to the floor 
 The way you use your sex appeal 
 Yeah it makes me keep wanting more 
 (Pre Chorus: Clinton Sparks) 
 And the hold you got on me is strong 
 You control me with your ways 
 And I know fucking with you is wrong 
 But I still do it anyway 
 (Chorus: Clinton Sparks) 
 What can I do? 
 I'm just so caught up 
 And I can't seem to get enough 
 Nothing I can do 
 When she takes her aim and hits me with that ultraviolet love 
 'Violet love 
 (Verse 2: Clinton Sparks) 
 You're so venomous, how you set me up for the kill (for the kill) 
 And your sex is dangerous, I'm addicted to how you feel 
 And I'm so strong I don't ???? up and I just can't come down 
 Yeah you trap me in your web of ??? realise when you're around 
 (Pre Chorus: Clinton Sparks) 
 Cause the hold you got on me is strong 
 You control me with your ways 
 And I know fucking with you is wrong 
 But I still do it anyway 
 (Chorus: Clinton Sparks) 
 What can I do? 
 I'm just so caught up 
 And I can't seem to get enough 
 Nothing I can do 
 When she takes her aim and hits me with that ultraviolet love 
 'Violet love 
 You-u-u-u-u 
 Got that ultraviolet love 
 Yeah, You-u-u-u-u 
 Got that ultraviolet love 
 (Verse 3: T.I.) 
 Listen, love 
 Hoppin' off in the whip again 
 Ain't nobody better I should know I've checked 
 How yo rock them heel' when you wearin' that dress 
 Them bitches can't win, they no contest, god bless em 
 And there' no place I'd rather be 
 Than on top of you or between your knees 
 And I gi' you my salary 
 Just to see you smile for me 
 You like it, I know 
 How I always up at yo' do' 
 And if you cold you can ha' my coat 
 I keep her wherever I go 
 And I go so hard I can't deny 
 That pussy do ??? like porcupine 
 If I can take that, throw it up in the sky 
 That'll be the very day we see the sun retire 
 (Chorus: Clinton Sparks) 
 What can I do? I'm just so caught up 
 And I can't seem to get enough 
 Nothing I can do 
 When she takes her aim and hits me with that ultraviolet love 
 'Violet love 
 You-u-u-u-u 
 Got that ultraviolet love 
 Yeah, You-u-u-u-u 
 Got that ultraviolet love
