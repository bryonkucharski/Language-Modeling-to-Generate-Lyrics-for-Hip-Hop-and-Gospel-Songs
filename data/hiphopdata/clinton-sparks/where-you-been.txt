(Feat. Clipse) 
 "Where you been, you ain't heard, got the word that I'm [gunshot] 
 That I'm so sin-cere" - Jay-Z {*repeat 3X*} 
 "Where you been" Pusha, "Where you been" Malice 
 "Where you been, wh-where you, where you been" 
 (Verse One: Clipse) 
 By the time the 5 pull up, e'ry (bitch) look up 
 Million records sold (nigga) still sellin cook up 
 Pusha, you know what the flow like 
 The hook-up, you know what that snow like 
 Got 7 Dwarves on the corner like I'm Snow White 
 (Fuck) I'm married to the game, throw rice 
 Keep the heater on my waist for them cold nights 
 Protect my chain, chest lit like it's Light Brite 
 A horse is a horse, of course of course 
 323 of 'em in that Porsche 
 Get a load of this, lifestyle of the rich 
 And I don't even race her, I baby that (bitch) 
 Oh the muggin, oh so repugnant 
 I fly 'em in from London, who like redundant? 
 I British Broadcast, this is billionaire day 
 Boys club, (fuck) the rocks, color canary - Clipse 
 (Verse Two: Clipse) 
 Cats ain't got a clue as to what real cash is 
 Each of my neighbors is doctors and actors 
 They wanna know 'bout the kid who half backwards 
 Who backyard look like it's a scene from The Masters 
 And what I know about a 9-iron 
 The only iron I know is the 9 I was firin 
 Now everywhere I look it's me they admirin 
 30 years in age, contemplatin retirement 
 Could it be, the jewels or the drop 
 Crib so huge that I call it Camelot 
 Or could it be that 50 carat watch 
 Or me on the red carpet, coolin with Carrot Top 
 Trust me young'n, I will show you the meanin' 
 In that Porsche 911, with the engine screamin 
 50 grand don't even feed my demons 
 My life like a fairytale, pinch me I'm dreamin'
