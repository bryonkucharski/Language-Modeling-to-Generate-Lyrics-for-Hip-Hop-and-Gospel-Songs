Before you say it's cheaper to keep her 
 We consider and read her 
 Man, she might be the type that want P to feed her 
 She wants a little cheaper, a little margarita 
 Mane, them draws comin' off when she see the two-seater 
 So put your Porche up, (uh) 
 Get your divorce up, (uh) 
 I'm sure she'll sign it when she seen me put my doors up 
 Mane, them niggas only wanna mother-fucker here 
 She threw her heels in the ocean, so she stuck to chill 
 The trunk is still, hopin' there's something between ya 
 Now she laughin' how she took your ass to the cleaners 
 Mane, I'm on your side, not tryna inconvient 
 Just know we got them mean keys in them plastic meaners 
 So keep it player dawg, 
 Don't make me say it, naw 
 Do something drastic, know that plastic heavy weighing, dawg 
 If it ain't music, or this money, I don't play at all 
 And she ain't either, so that means she doesn't weight at all 
 Now we can both post sip or keep it playa mane 
 And we can both pull a misses, keep it playa mane 
 Or we grind our wrists and keep it playa mane 
 Or you can scram cocksuck if you a hater mane 
 I keep 'em ladies going uh-uh-uh, 
 Uh-uh-uh (ha), uh-uh-uh (yeah), uh-uh-uh 
 I'm a grown mane, Thug ain't the one to play no games with ya 
 Thug the one to call and come get out the chain with ya 
 And hang with ya, when ya full of Patrone 
 And oh yeah, brang one of ya cute partnas along 
 Because I'm only 25, and still going live 
 I got the estate by the pool, by the lake outside 
 I wake up and gotta pick which car I'ma drive 
 The Doubble are 760, or the 645, I'm 
 Havin' thangs, mane, check out the chain 
 Money ain't never been a thang 
 You see watch and the rang (the watch and the rang) 
 Rocks the nicest, never seen nothin' like this 
 I'ma Boss I on' ask what it cost, my life priceless 
 Baby girl you might just 
 Get the shatter shine 
 Long as you not selfish or learn to share sometimes 
 And of course I'm still you'res and you're still mine 
 But you can't be a hater, mane 
 You gotta keep it playa, mane 
 They say JLo shouldn't show her ass and all 
 Knowin' the worst thing could happen is a nigga could palm 
 Now my angent sayin' the only way that he could be calm 
 I put a hundred mil on each song, like my name was LaBron (wha') 
 Not the ice, my beat is worth more 
 Attractive like a whole damn Jacob store 
 See niggas hate you more when you take they broad 
 But his girl looked in my ear and seen her matrix door 
 Dude's is foolish, they hues us to chew us 
 I mean, the smirfs, the green, the rocks is so bluish 
 You can't out bling me, or BBC jean me 
 You ain't got no vibe, you can go and ask MiMi 
 I think and relay it 
 I blink and P-J it 
 You wanna make fast bucks, take this and Ebay it 
 And all you Phantom owners know why you can't stand me 
 Got one in Virigina 'nother one in Miami
