Texas tatted on my arm, got Houston on my back 
 'Cause I love the city I'm from, hands up if you feel that 
 I ball hard like a Texan, every Sunday catch me wreckin' 
 [?], Code name Boss because you can't catch him 
 And they catch them bops like Dre do 
 Ball hard like I play too, run that back like Jay do 
 Bet a couple [?] and we play you 
 We came to win, can't take a loss 
 Ain't shit 'bout that H South, 
 Team strong we'll break 'em off, lay 'em down then rake 'em out 
 Car roof like [?], when the sun's out I drop the top 
 H-Town we shinin' red white and blue in that lot 
 See you boys in the playoffs, bet you this year we on top 
 And if you from that H like me, you already know what I'm talkin' 'bout 
 I'm from Houston, Texas home of the Texans [x3] 
 Texas Tatted on my arm, Houston on my back 
 I'm from Houston, Texas home of the Texans [x3] 
 Texas Tatted on my arm, Houston on my back 
 I'm from that HOU TEX, non-believers get put to the death 
 Then hard times, we get put to the test, but dedication turn the last to the best 
 Stop complainin' just a little bit less and start to quest on the road to success 
 We got now and we got next, say it loud with some bass in your chest 
 Haters hate but now they on jock like Joseph and Queen the corners on lock 
 I come through the line like Brian Kush and then I can't be blocked like JJ Watt 
 Now we on top, no more middle, like Super Mario I'm a hard hitter 
 Can't be stopped, don't be bitter, never give up 'cause I'm a go getter 
 In the groupie and I wade through you, she like Torro and the whole crew 
 In battle red or liberty white out, I might come out in the deep still blue 
 I thought boys knew, don't be surprised, tell them boys about Texas pride 
 We ride for each other when we on the otherside and if you ain't [?] 
 Hold up 
 If you ain't from Texas, you didn't get the message 
 Let me give you boys a quick lesson then 
 I swore to God to be fresh to death, I didn't die so time to get fresh again 
 You know the H what I'm reppin' and it's like 35% Mexican 
 And that's so ironic (why?) 
 Every cup is like 35% beverage and 65% medicine 
 Plenty [?] for thick specimens 
 A million fine and bad yela's and that's like 22% lesbian 
 And in my zone what you steppin' in, then I bet my fist is gone check a chin 
 'Cause that trill in Bun, and that trill is Pimp, and that trill is somethin' y'all never been 
 Hit your woman and let her in to my vehicle that I never tint 
 That brain got to be official baby, no artificial intelligence 
 I'm runnin' in it like Andre, if y'all ain't from Houston I ain't convinced 
 'Cause y'all touch down in our city once and been rappin' like you are ever since
