P-p-playin' still 
 Thugga 
 (I wanna be free) 
 I don't need a lover, I don't need a family 
 I don't need a ball and chain here keepin' me 
 I don't need a bride time, no wide valentine 
 I don't need a heart that's stringin' me worldwide 
 I wanna be free fallin', free ballin' 
 On the top of the city lights callin' 
 Don't feel sorry for me 'cause I wanna be free 
 I wanna be free 
 (I wanna be free, I wanna be free) 
 No marriage for me, I'm cool 
 To give a single life up, I be a fool 
 Party all night, sleep all day 
 Pack up and go when I wanna get away 
 This week N.Y., next L.A. 
 Then in Miami just to see the heat play 
 Settlin' down now nope not in my world 
 Why pick when I get all the pretty girls? 
 I wanna be free and just do me 
 Welcome to the thug show, it's a movie 
 A lot of groupies, late nights and fun times 
 No need to worry, I'll be fine 
 I don't need a lover, I don't need a family 
 I don't need a ball and chain here keepin' me 
 I don't need a bride time, no wide valentine 
 I don't need a heart that's stringin' me worldwide 
 I wanna be free fallin', free ballin' 
 On the top of the city lights callin' 
 Don't feel sorry for me 'cause I wanna be free 
 I wanna be free 
 (I wanna be free, I gotta be free) 
 It's peace and quit when I wake up 
 House clean, no girl clothes or make-up 
 Smoke what I want, turn the music bass up 
 Oh, you tired, let me call another date up 
 Why you mad at me, baby, I ain't your man 
 I'm what they call your homie lover friend 
 Late night hype when you feelin' lonely 
 But you never ever be the one and only 
 I'm gone all the time, too focused on my grind 
 To be on the road with your home on my mind 
 I live a life that ain't right for a wife 
 Too much temptation out here every night 
 I don't need a lover, I don't need a family 
 I don't need a ball and chain here keepin' me 
 I don't need a bride time, no wide valentine 
 I don't need a heart that's stringin' me worldwide 
 I wanna be free fallin', free ballin' 
 On the top of the city lights callin' 
 Don't feel sorry for me 'cause I wanna be free 
 I wanna be free 
 (I wanna be free, I wanna be free) 
 I do what I wanna do when I want to 
 See who I wanna see when I want to 
 Be where I wanna be when I want to 
 'Cause I'm free to do whatever I wanna do 
 And it feel good, yeah, real good 
 No stress from my ex no more 
 I'm in the cool top, downright solo 
 And I won't get locked down no more 
 I don't need a lover, I don't need a family 
 I don't need a ball and chain here keepin' me 
 I don't need a bride time, no wide valentine 
 I don't need a heart that's stringin' me worldwide 
 I wanna be free fallin', free ballin' 
 On the top of the city lights callin' 
 Don't feel sorry for me 'cause I wanna be free 
 I wanna be free 
 (I wanna be free, I wanna be free) 
 I wanna be free 
 I wanna be free 
 I wanna be free 
 I wanna be free
