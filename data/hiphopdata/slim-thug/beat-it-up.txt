Slim Thug: 
 Baby girl, listen up, let me holla for a second 
 I ain't tryin' to be rude, I'm just tryin' to get you naked 
 I figured if I kept it 100, you'll respect it 
 I know you tired of niggas lyin' to you, so check it 
 I ain't tryin' to settle down, but I wanna fuck 
 I wanna be behind you when you back that pussy up 
 You look like a good girl, I'm a make you my slut 
 I bet you like it slow, I'm a make you like it rough 
 See I'm the type of nigga that'll fuck your life up 
 Make you leave your man when he tryin' to wife you up 
 'Cause that nigga borin' I'm in to explorin' 
 You only with that nigga for them things that's important 
 He got a good job & a real good father 
 Layed in debt but damn girl. Why bother? 
 You need excitement in your life, fuck with me 
 Quit settlin' for squares, fall in love with a G. 
 (Chorus: Dallas Blocker) 
 Guess what? I'm fuckin' tonight 
 Whether you know it or not I'm a beat that pussy right 
 Yeah, I'm fuckin' tonight 
 See, I'm a beat that pussy up. 
 (I'm a Beat It Up) [3x]

 (I ain't gotta eat it up) 
 Slim Thug: 
 I'm tryin' to lay in it, then play in it 
 If it's good all night, I'm a stay in it 
 Sway in it if it's tight, I'm a get it right 
 Hop on top, you know what your daddy like 
 Ride it like a bike, baby, don't fall off 
 I wanna see them titties bouncin' take it all off 
 She tryin' to crawl off say it's in too deep 
 Bust so much, she quit and tryin' to fall asleep 
 Turn that ass over, back stroke woke her up 
 Grab her by hell while I slap her on the butt 
 I'm about to bust, pulled out snatched the rubber off 
 And like a trill bitch she let me put it in her mouth. 
 (Chorus: Dallas Blocker) 
 Guess what? I'm fuckin' tonight 
 Whether you know it or not I'm a beat that pussy right 
 Yeah, I'm fuckin' tonight 
 See, I'm a beat that pussy up.

 Dallas Blocker: 
 Is you gon' let me rock it? Say you'll let me rock it 
 I'm a gon' beat it till the walls come a knockin' 
 Baby don't stop it, open, let me drop it 
 Turn that ass around and get it beat by Dallas Blocker 
 You need to never mind it, you'll be on the mountain 
 I'm a take a shower and just act like we've been nappin'. 
 Guess what? I'm fuckin' tonight... yeah 
 So baby if your down, call me over, I will be around 
 I'll be on the other side of town 
 Hit me if you wanna fuck around. 
 (Chorus: Dallas Blocker)
