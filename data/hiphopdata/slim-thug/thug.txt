 I represent the H at the bottom of the map 
 And I was born & raised in the bottom of the trap 
 The number 1 rule is you gotta stay straped 
 'Cause any givin' minute you can take that long nap 
 I roll with gorillas, dealers & the killers 
 'Cause when I'm on stage that's the only fool spillers 
 Real Trill niggas, let me see your hands 
 But I do this for the streets, I ain't tryin' to make you dance 
 Roll so low, I don't need no friends 
 Still flip that lac, I don't need no Benz 
 And Harlem throwin' money, I don't need no Zen's 
 Matter fact I be back, I need more to spend 
 She say she wanna... 
 Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug. 
 Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug. 
 Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug. 
 Thug from around the way. 
 Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug. 
 Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug. 
 Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug.

 It's white-T, Nikes, when I hit the club 
 They say I can't get in 'cause I'm dressed like a Thug 
 Fuck the dress code (fuck 'em) we 'about a hundred deep 
 And they gon' let it seen, or get they ass beat 
 Boss Hogg Outlaws roll like the mob 
 Everybody paid 'cause we stays on our job 
 Drop in GT a blessin' from the Lord 
 So haters don't be mad that we blame it on god 
 I'm comin' out hard, them other boys soft 
 So I'm a hold it down for that H & the Nawf 
 Brand new jewelry look what I brought 
 Still runnin' from the feds, I ain't never gettin' caught 
 She say she wanna... 
 Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug. 
 Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug. 
 Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug. 
 Thug from around the way. 
 Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug. 
 Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug. 
 Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug. 
 Thug from around the way. 
 You say your man ain't fuckin' you right 
 Your lonely & depression need a Thug in your life 
 Well come on over here, I can feel your appetite 
 Take you back to the crib & beat it all night 
 She say she love a Thug 'cause Thugga beat it good 
 Her man pay them bills, but Thugga keep it hood 
 And I ain't gotta stare, that's already understood 
 I take you for a ride, you can slide on my wood 
 I pick her up & shake her up & down like dice 
 Sweet like cake make me wanna take a slice 
 I ain't tryin' to take advantage, but take my advice 
 Take a break from the fakes, get a Thug in your life 
 She say she wanna... 
 Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug.
