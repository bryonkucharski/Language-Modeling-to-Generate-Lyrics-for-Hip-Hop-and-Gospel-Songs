 Bitch, I know you see us

 If a nigga got a problem with that, meet me outside mayn ha 
 I'm the Dirty South Boss, you got a problem with that 
 Them Outlawz run the Nawf, you got a problem with that 
 We do the blue when we floss, you got a problem with that 
 And we'll knock your head off, who got a problem with that 
 B.H.O. run the streets, you got a problem with that 
 We overloaded with heat, you got a problem with that 
 We put fire to the beat, you got a problem with that 
 It's them Hoggs time to eat, who got a problem with that 
 (Slim Thug) 
 Bitch niggaz bow down, when the Boss come around 
 'Fore I pop the fo' pound, and leave your head on the ground 
 We run the motherfucking town, you don't like it do some'ing 
 And you pussies just bumping, y'all ain't tal'n 'bout nothing 
 I got the F in cock, and the bitch ain't on safety 
 For you haters that hate me, go on 'head and make me 
 Unload the whole clip, 'fore I let a nigga take me 
 Mad cause your bitch trash ass, wanna date me 
 Ol' pussy ass nigga, you got bitch in your blood 
 My heart pump thug, I'll drop you in the club 
 On sight take your life, we can do the shit tonight 
 We could pull out the guns, or we could pick a square and fight nigga 
 (Slim Thug) 
 You don't want no problems, you don't want no drama 
 I send them gunners in a Hummer, you won't even see the summer 
 I'ma pray for your mama, but her son gotta go 
 But her son was a hoe, so my gun gotta blow 
 Farewell, I'll see your pussy ass down in hell 
 Next day post bail, bitch I'm back up out of jail 
 They can't keep me in a cell, cause my money too long 
 Go to trial beat the case, cause my money too strong 
 OJ Simpson, you don't want it with me pimping 
 I'll stop pop the clip in, start pop until you dripping 
 Mayn you sucker niggaz tripping, Boss Hogg got it locked 
 You got a problem with that, I'll bring it to your block nigga 
 (Slim Thug) 
 You can't see me nigga, you can't be me nigga 
 You can buy till you broke, you can't beat me nigga 
 You can't buy real niggaz, real niggaz get raised 
 And fuck being broke, real niggaz get paid 
 I don't break under pressure, real niggaz stay brave 
 And stay chose by hoes, cause real niggaz got it made 
 I'm a H-Town nigga, stay down nigga 
 You small time, I'm a heavyweight pound nigga 
 Don't hate clown nigga, I got cake now nigga 
 While you sleep, them Hoggs still awake clown nigga 
 On great pine niggaz, working late clown nigga 
 I'm feeling you great, you better get it shape round nigga
