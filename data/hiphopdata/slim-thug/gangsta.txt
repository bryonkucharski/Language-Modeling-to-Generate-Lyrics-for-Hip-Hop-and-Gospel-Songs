 Gangsta from my head to my shoes

 (Verse 2: Z-Ro) 
 Huh, that's right my nigga money, hoes, cars, clothes 
 I think I fell in love with clothes and cars and doe 
 I know y'all don't be seeing me at award shows 
 Fuck going commercial real nigga, y'all know how it goes 
 Thousand dollar bottle of camante y'all know how it flows 
 I die once, a thousand times that's how a coward goes 
 You don't want none of me nigga I got power blow 
 Hoes as big as tennis balls that's all a six sour note 
 Attitude like Pimp C, cup taste like Big Moe 
 R.I.P. to Pat and for the Hawk, that's my big bro 
 Every CD in my car say "DJ Screw" 
 If you from Houston and you rap my nigga he made you 
 I keep pens and pencils like bitches I pimp them hoes 
 Get it out of cock, put it in my socks it's what I do with the doe 
 Money ain't never been mad at me I stay cool with the doe 
 Like a dummy when he peeing I'm a fool with the flow 
 (Hook: Z-Ro)
