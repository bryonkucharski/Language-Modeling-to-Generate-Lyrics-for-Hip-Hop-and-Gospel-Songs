Thugga, Boss Hogg Outlawz, action 
 It's the motherfuckin Thug Show 
 Hah, hah, Geah, south fire in this bitch 
 Slim Thugga in this bitch 
 Good evening, welcome to Outlawz season 
 I'd like to say hello, you tune in to Tha Thug Show 
 Thugga the throwdest nigga in the universe, cooler than a fan is 
 Girls give me pussy, say I'm cooler than their man is 
 I beat it up without a fee, with you she hit the lottery 
 I'm on some G-shit, fair exchange, no robbery 
 Your money's my philosophy, millions with a apostrophy 
 I guess it's why these HPDs and APDs watchin me 
 H-Town's my property, the boss, man, I gotta be 
 So if you land on it, pay up, like on monopoly 
 Your dream bitch jockin me, but I give her no play 
 If you ain't fuckin', keep your lips out my rosse 
 You rap niggas role play, I live this shit that I talk 
 Welcome to the thug show, star me, thug boss 
 My whips change with the season, now could this be the reason 
 Your bitch mouth on my dick like she teasin 
 Longest a nigga breathin, I'ma be eatin, a Hogg appetite greedy 
 Trying to stack my next meal, so hurry up and feed me 
 Got two kids that need me, so I hustle till I pass out 
 Chasing up that paper, boy, like this my last route 
 Trying to make you feel me like I'm spittin' out my last out 
 I'm richer than you niggas, don't make me pull this cash out 
 It ain't 'bout what you 'bout, It's more 'bout what you say 
 They say you can't take it with you, but fuck it, put it in my grave 
 I'm trying to get the heaven bait, 'cause I'm used to living laid 
 And if they got the VIP, then you gon see me on stage 
 Whole team (?) starters hustle hard and party harder 
 This is 'bout to go down, hope you got your tape recorders 
 Catch me in the club wasted, bad bitch in my view 
 Take her home plus 2, you know how the Thugga do 
 Raw uncut, turn a pornstar with a slut 
 Beat it from behind, pull out and bust on a butt 
 Triple X rated, I know plenty people hate it 
 I'm still happy that a nigga made it 
 So we gon celebrate it, fire up this weed and get drunk 
 Fuckin' act like we from ATL and this bitch get crunk 
 It's H-Town, still now, so Texas where the love go 
 I'm what you been lookin' for, stay tuned to Tha Thug Show
