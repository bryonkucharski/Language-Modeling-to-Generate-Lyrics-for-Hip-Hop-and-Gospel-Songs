Heaven, I'm in heaven 
 And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak 
 And I seem to find the happiness I seek 
 When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek 
 It's heaven, I'm in heaven 
 And the cares that hung around me through the week 
 Seems to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak 
 When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek 
 Oh, I'd love to climb a mountain 
 And reach the highest peak 
 But it doesn't thrill me half as much 
 As dancing cheek to cheek 
 Oh, I'd love to go out fishing 
 In a river or a creek 
 But I don't enjoy it half as much 
 As dancing cheek to cheek 
 Now Mamma, dance with me 
 I want my arms about you 
 The charms about you 
 Will carry me through 
 It's heaven, I'm in heaven 
 And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak 
 And I seem to find the happiness I seek 
 When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek 
 Heaven, I'm in heaven 
 And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak 
 And I seem to find the happiness I seek 
 When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek 
 Heaven, I'm in heaven 
 And the cares that hung around me through the week 
 Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak 
 When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek 
 Oh, I'd love to climb a mountain 
 And to reach the highest peak 
 But it doesn't thrill me half as much 
 As dancing cheek to cheek 
 Oh, I'd love to go out fishing 
 In a river or a creek 
 But I don't enjoy it half as much 
 As dancing cheek to cheek 
 Come on, and dance with me 
 I want my arm about you 
 The charm about you 
 Will carry me through to heaven 
 I'm in heaven 
 And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak 
 And I seem to find the happiness I seek 
 When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek 
 Yes, dance with me 
 I want my arms about you 
 The charms about you 
 Will carry me through to heaven 
 I'm in heaven, I'm in heaven 
 And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak 
 And I seem to find the happiness I seek 
 When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek 
 Cheek to cheek 
 Cheek to cheek 
 Cheek to cheek
