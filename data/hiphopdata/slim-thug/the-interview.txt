(Woman interview) 
 What's good everybody? 
 It's your girl Alana D. 
 Chillin' with my boy the boy slim thug 
 He's from Texas 
 Now son you've been doin' it real big for awhile 
 But please, tell us what's the secret to your success? 
 (Slim) 
 I'm a bonafide hustla 
 Used to have to bust bricks down in half 
 In order to see the cash 
 That's in the past 
 Niggas outta see the stash 
 Went straight to the bentley 
 Skipped the S-class 
 I was a star before I signed autographs 
 This the beginning, y'all ain't seen my last 
 When I call myself a hustla, 
 I ain't talking about moving rocks 
 I'm talkin' 'bout them 9's and them aks and them glocks 
 When y'all was on the corner 
 Out there runnin' from them cops 
 I was out there sellin' all them local crack spots 
 Boyz in blue and we creep deep 
 Motherfuckin' police 
 We make the rules in the streets nigga 
 (Woman interviewer) 
 I feel you 
 I feel you 
 Now we talk about the style of Texas 
 NOw many seem to think cause you got that Texas style 
 That's gonna limit your success 
 Tell us what you think about that 
 (Slim) 
 I'm an H-town nigga 
 So FUCK y'all niggas 
 Got a fo'-fo' thatta buck y'all niggas 
 Stay out my way 
 Cause nigga I'm not for play 
 Ya niggas say you G's 
 That must mean you niggas gay 
 He's from H-town 
 But he don't stay where I stay 
 I'm from the land of the killers 
 He don't lay where I lay 
 So get it right motherfuckers 
 Don't try to put me in the same shoes as them suckers 
 There's a real thick line between rhymers and some hustlas 
 Them niggas ain't no gangstas, 
 Them niggas is some bustas 
 (Woman interviewer) 
 Okay talk to 'em 
 I see you here with all these diamonds, all these chains 
 You drivin' around in bentley's 
 But I don't ever see you with any security, 
 Please, what's the word on that 
 (Slim) 
 Pistol grip pump in my lap at all times 
 They be checkin' other fools, but they ain't checkin' mine 
 You run up tryin' you gon' be lyin' down dyin' 
 When you hear that clock clock sound comin' out of the iron 
 I ain't no fuckin' punk, I suggest you niggas chill 
 'Cause if I pop this trunk, then somebody gon' get killed 
 This ain't no rap act, my nigga I'm really real 
 Go on run your ass up, and watch me stop you with the steel 
 Niggas must be on peel, 'cause it's evident they 
 Think the boss went soft 'cause I got a record deal 
 I do this rap shit cause makin' hits pay my bills 
 And I could give a fuck what you other suckers feel 
 For real 
 (Woman interviewer) 
 Aight yo, keep doin' your thing 
 We lookin' out for you brother 
 You got anything else in the works 
 What can we expect from you in the future? 
 (Slim) 
 Boys in blue, comin' soon
