That's right 
 I went from ashy to classy, to classic 
 Quarter million dollar car 
 You can't pass me 
 Haters can you hear me now 
 I can barely hear you 
 Mother fuckers too far in my rearview 
 That's right 
 I went from ashy to classy, to classic 
 Quarter million dollar car 
 You can't pass me 
 Haters can you see me now 
 A nigga pocket so swoll' 
 They can't stand to see a young nigga home 
 Ballin' outta control 
 Started out a little young nigga, 'bout 15 
 Tryin' to figure out ways to get big green 
 Had dreams of rock gleams, 
 Top down on the old school 
 Cause the hustla's ridin' clean looked so cool 
 You know the rules, I got in where I fit in 
 Why not hit the block, all my other brothers did it 
 Had to get out there and get it on my own 
 'Cause when you turn 16, nowadays you grown 
 Mama did her best, 'cause I never missed a meal 
 But I'm tired of takin' money 
 That shit needed for bills, you feel me? 
 I'm tryin' to take a little weight up off her back 
 So I'm takin' up the slack, thanks to feens wantin' crack 
 A 50 pack, to a half, to a whole 
 To be 15 nigga, my pockets on swoll' 
 Huh 
 I'm finally bout to get my chance to go pro 
 And let the city know Slim thug gettin' dough 
 I went from ashy to classy, to classic 
 Quarter million dollar car 
 You can't pass me 
 Haters can you hear me now 
 I can barely hear you 
 Mother fuckers too far in my rearview 
 That's right 
 I went from ashy to classy, to classic 
 Quarter million dollar car 
 You can't pass me 
 Haters can you see me now 
 A nigga pocket so swoll' 
 They can't stand to see a young nigga home, 
 Ballin' outta control 
 Now I'm the one ridin' clean, Just made 17 
 But I ain't satisfied with the cash the block bring 
 And them law snatchin niggas off the block every night 
 Cause boys treatin' this shit 'cause it's a normal 9 to 5 
 Instead of trying to put their paper in a row 
 These niggas on the block hustlin' till they get caught 
 But a, my mama didn't ain't no fool 
 I had to chill for a minute and just focus on school 
 And if I wasn't in the hall gettin' ho's 
 I was chillin' wit my niggas spittin' flows 
 Next thing you know I'm at the club doin' shows 
 And gettin' bank rolls when I step through the doors 
 My pussy rate at an all-time high 
 And ain't too much shit that I want I can't buy 
 I'm livin' good, everyday stay fly 
 I guess that's why the niggas in the hood say hi 
 I went from ashy to classy, to classic 
 Quarter million dollar car 
 You can't pass me 
 Haters can you hear me now 
 I can barely hear you 
 Mother fuckers too far in my rearview 
 That's right 
 I went from ashy to classy, to glassy 
 Quarter million dollar car 
 You can't pass me 
 Haters can you see me now 
 A nigga pocket so swoll' 
 They can't stand to see a young nigga home, 
 Ballin' outta control 
 Nowadays I'm a made man 
 And word is Slim thug is a very well paid man 
 I'm raybanned up, top down, mashing 
 Lookin' in the rearview at the haters that I'm passin' 
 So please stop with them questions you askin' 
 I'm a hustla, I'ma stay smashing. 
 Quarter million dollar cars, I'm livin' like a star 
 VIP with the bar, players buyin' out the bar 
 And even though a nigga didn't shoot hoops 
 I still found ways to make NBA loot 
 A young nigga got his pockets on swoll' 
 They can't stahnd to see a young nigga home 
 Ballin' outta control 
 I went from ashy to classy, to classic 
 Quarter million dollar car 
 You can't pass me 
 Haters can you hear me now 
 I can barely hear you 
 Mother fuckers too far in my rearview 
 That's right 
 I went from ashy to classy, to classic 
 Quarter million dollar car 
 You can't pass me 
 Haters can you see me now 
 A nigga pocket so swoll' 
 They can't stand to see a young nigga home, 
 Ballin' outta control ...
