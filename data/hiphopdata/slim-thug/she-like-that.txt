I see the way she checkin' for a gangsta, I know that she like that, 
 I know that she like that (she like that) 
 The way them diamonds keep shinin' so fine, I know that she like that, 
 I know that she like that (she like that) 
 The way I keep it so hood, levin' in the wood, candy paint goin' for them photos kept 'em good, 
 She like that, I know that she like that [X3] 
 (Verse 1 - Slim Thug) 
 I know she like that, I got her coming right back 
 She wanna be with a G, she on the right track 
 Her eyes stuck on my chest with all that ice and 
 Ain't never seen that much bling, she try'na price that 
 She like my nice tatts and the way I keep it hood 
 And how I stay and flip a candy lac grippin' wood 
 Keep some smoke red eyes behind them Louie Locs 
 A fresh set of vauxs' wrapped on them super pokes 
 Stay in the hood but she know a nigga fuckin' broke 
 Be on the block so much, she think I'm still sellin' dope 
 If I was running for hood boss, I got a vote 
 Them haters might keep hatin', but I gotta gloat 
 (Verse 2 - Killa Kyleon) 
 Lil' mama so super freaky, ya she's my super freak 
 Just call her my wonder woman, and I'm her super man 
 Lil' mama so super bad, just like 'em baby kids 
 Come to my bed where we go ever sense were baby kids 
 I asked "so sexy can I', get on that Ray J shit 
 She Rep'd like yes and kept it playin' like a Ray J hit 
 She love that Ray J shit, she like my second movie 
 I keep them camera rollin' kick back and watch a movie 
 But if you want to take your sleepy eyes home girl 
 Fuckin' good make you wanna take it home girl 
 But if you want to, we can get it on girl 
 And we can do it all night long girl 
 From the women to the world we can never bone 
 Save the world baby girl you can never know 
 Hit me any time baby I be right back 
 Fuckin' like a porn star, I know she like that
