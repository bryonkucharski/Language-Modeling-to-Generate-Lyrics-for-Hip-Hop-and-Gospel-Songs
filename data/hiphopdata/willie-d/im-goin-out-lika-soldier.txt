Born, born, born, born, born, born, born killer 
 I'm that mothafucking god damn nigga 
 The brother that's tougher than any other you cover 
 The one you don't wanna take home to your mother 
 Fuck a loose screw, let me enlighten 
 I got a whole mothafucking toolbox need tighten 
 Fast like lighting, punch like Tyson 
 It's a clash of titans when I start fighting 
 So what's a god damn reporter? 
 A nigga with a foot in his ass and a tape recorder 
 Dissing W-I double L-I-E-D 
 And don't know shit about me 
 But you don't see me running 
 I'm from the ghetto, hoe, so I keep coming... 
 With more nerves, more verbs, more cuss words 
 To fuck with the suburds 
 You can't stand me or can me 
 Bullets gonna go through people if you ban me 
 Cause you fucking with my livelihood 
 For your health that ain't no good 
 Like Breed I'm 20 below and getting colder 
 Going out lika soldier... 
 Crisp and clean I'm leaving the scene 
 Blowing mothafuckas to smithereens 
 And if I fall you know they didn't pimp me 
 Cause the banana clip will be empty 
 You say: Willie, clean up your act 
 And maybe you can sell more records than that 
 Survival comes before principles and morals 
 So to the man on the street I'ma stay loyal 
 And fuck up those who oppose 
 Outta there smelling like a rose 
 You ain't never seen a mothafucka kill a mothafucka 
 Lika mothafucka named Willie D mothafucka 
 Rambo can't go 
 And Robocop get dropped like a hoe 
 By something that they never saw 
 An M-72A2 mothafucking law 
 We can rumble in the jungle 
 Or have a World War 3 right here on the concrete 
 God damn, I done told ya 
 (Willie D) goin' out lika soldier... 
 Fuck this, fuck that is my motto 
 Willie D is fucking everybody like a hot hoe 
 So you better put a condom on your ear 
 'Cause I'm burning up the normal shit you hear 
 Smoking, smoking 
 Y'all mothafuckas know I ain't joking 
 I've been paying my dues for a decade 
 (What time it is?) It's time to get paid 
 Yeah, fuck the bullshit 
 And that nigga standing at the damn pulpit 
 I left Charlie Brown on the cut 
 'Cause I felt like Snoopy working for peanuts 
 Now my ass is soe 
 And I can't be fucked no mo' 
 So if you wanna test me, that'll hold ya 
 I'm goin' out lika soldier... 
 I'm goin' out lika S-O-L-D-I-E-R 
 Pumped up for an all out war 
 Searching like a predator 
 With an M-16 looking for a magazine editor 
 I know they don't write the columns 
 But they co-sign every volume 
 So I'm cutting off the head of state 
 So the rest of the body can't operate 
 And while I'm into the slaughter 
 I may as well bust a cap on a TV reporter 
 And a DJ by the way 
 For giving that wicky wack shit radio play 
 If that's your preference so be it 
 But I'ma call it like I mothafucking see it 
 And never be a pop chart trick 
 Y'all talk loud but you don't say shit 
 I'd rather boycott that picture 
 And rap about that which affects ya 
 You wonder why the cussing won't disappear 
 God damn, we ain't happy down here 
 Willie D got problems 
 So when mom walk in, turn down the volume 
 And act like you're doing your homework 
 Or get your pussy or your dick knocked in the dirt 
 There's a vet in your vicinity 
 So pump up Ice Cube and jam Public Enemy 
 And let the O.G. Ice-T kick a rhyme that'll mold ya 
 And go out like a soldier...
