Fuck Rodney King in his ass 
 When I see tha mothafucka I'ma blast 
 Boom in his head, boom, boom in his back just like that 
 'Cause I'm tired of you good little niggas 
 Saying increase the peace and let the violence cease 
 When the black man built this country 
 But can't get his for the prejudiced honky 
 Rodney King, god damn sell-out 
 On TV crying for a cop 
 The same mothafuckas who beat the hell outcha 
 Now I wish they would've shotcha 
 Cause this shit is deeper than Vietnam 
 And ain't no room for the Uncle Tom 
 Let the white man dress you up and mess you up 
 I wouldn't be surprised if he sexed you up 
 Cause you look like a gay 
 Letting them white folks tell you what to say 
 But I'm glad that niggas stayed out of check 
 Cause that's the only thing rednecks respect 
 We don't want your welfare checks 
 Nigga need a real job to buy a rolex 
 And until we get it, we gonna keep throwing them things 
 Fuck Rodney King! 
 Fuck'em, fuck'em, fuck'em, fuck'em, fuck'em, fuck'em 
 Fuck that nigga! 
 Fuck'em, fuck'em, fuck'em, fuck'em, fuck'em, fuck'em 
 Now the Negro National Anthem: 
 "We shall overcome... we shall overcome..." 
 Fuck all that singing 
 I'ma be too busy swinging 
 That's the problem with the black folks 
 Always wanna bust a note 
 And hold hands and form rallies 
 And down niggas for fighting back in Cali 
 I'm down with the niggas who's nexting 
 Fuck all that god damn protesting 
 So don't try to pull it 
 5th Ward niggas fight bullets with bullets 
 Right between the eyes 
 So you can keep your mothafucking Noble Peace Prize 
 I said fuck Rodney King and I mean it 
 And any mothafucka out there who resent it 
 Cause didn't nobody set a fire for Willie D 
 When the laws beat the fuck out of me 
 Fuck Rodney King! 
 Fuck'em, fuck'em, fuck'em, fuck'em, fuck'em, fuck'em 
 Fuck that nigga! 
 Fuck'em, fuck'em, fuck'em, fuck'em, fuck'em, fuck'em 
 Fuck that nigga! 
 Fuck that mothafucking sell-out hoe 
 They need to beat his ass some mo' 
 Fool talking about stop the violence 
 When niggas can't even shit in silence 
 I can't ride up the street with my homies without 5-0 all on me 
 Riding my tailgate and running my god damn license plate 
 Sweating Willie D since I'm a minority 
 They fuck with me, I still got a lot of grudges 
 It's high time that we take out some judges 
 And some congressmen and senators who cheat us 
 And all of these so called black leaders 
 Like Craig Washington, nigga sound dense 
 Trying to play both sides of the fence 
 Brown nosing 'cause he was chosen 
 By the whites to make niggas act right 
 You can't lead the black struggle 
 And be friends with the enemy, mothafucka 
 While you trying to keep your fucking job 
 Black folks getting robbed 
 But when it's time for the revolution 
 I'ma click, click, click, fuck this rap shit 
 Cause money ain't shit but a grief 
 If you ain't got no peace 
 Gotta come on with it, get down for my little Willies 
 So they con come up strong and live long 
 And not to be scared to get it on...
