Convict... 
 Akon... 
 Everybody I know around my way still there (everybody's still there) 
 And waiting for a miracle to pass them by 
 Most of them are known drug dealers and I know them well 
 (Yes I know them well) 
 That's the only way they know how to survive 
 'Cause it's the way to get by 
 It's the only way to get by 
 If I had a choice aside from this life god knows I try... 
 To get away... 
 Ooh yeah... 
 In his heart whoa... 
 Everybody I know around my way still there (everybody's still there) 
 And waiting for a miracle to pass them by 
 Most of them are known drug dealers and I know them well 
 (Yes I know them well) 
 That's the only way they know how to survive 
 'Cause it's the way to get by 
 It's the only way to get by 
 If I had a choice aside from this life god knows I try... 
 To get away... 
 Everybody I know around my way still there (everybody's still there)

 Ooh yeah... 
 Oh yeah...
