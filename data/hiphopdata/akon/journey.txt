Akon (akon) 
 C'mon (c'mon) 
 This is the ultimate journey of your life 
 Where the weak die and the strong survive 
 Prepare to suffer 40 days and 40 nights 
 Strap on your boots because you got a long hike 
 Just another journey, another journey into time 
 C'mon now 
 Just another journey, who ever thought I'd cross this line 
 Ohohohohoh 
 Walking through the dirty streets of Jersey (Jersey) 
 A dollar to my name, searchin for that key 
 I'm tryin' not to reincorinate my past 
 Retired from the game, took another path 
 Destination '95 Dirty South 
 Where the devil tried to realter my route 
 Creator took me by the hand and led the way-ay 
 To make the story short that's why I'm here today 
 What about that day you said I would not ---- 
 And about that day you kicked me out onto the bricks 
 What about that time you said I wouldn't make a dime 
 And about that time you said I couldn't make you mine 
 Destination to the bank overseas 
 Where Akons treated like royalty 
 Cause there's so much in this world that I have to see-e 
 The wave is rolling jump on it a follow me-e 
 {Breakdown} 
 Born and raised in Africa trying to make a scene 
 (Trying to make a scene) 
 The best way to get to you is by this music thing 
 And you might believe (believe, believe)

 C'mon (c'mon) 
 Lets take it to the streets 
 I traveled through the ghettos of America 
 Lets take it to the streets 
 I traveled through the ghettos of Africa 
 Lets take it to the streets 
 I traveled through the ghettos of Asia 
 Lets take it to the streets 
 I traveled through the ghettos all over 
 In my journey yeah (yeah, yeah)
