OC (huh) 
 Its about to get hot! 
 US (huh) 
 Its about to get hot! 
 All this (huh) 
 And the beat it don't stop 
 We keep rockin' it 
 We keep rockin' it 
 Everybody watching her 
 The way she sway to the beat 
 From the left to the right 
 Tryin' to see what up with her 
 Who's the lucky man who gonna have a wild for the night 
 I wanna say she's eyein me 
 But I can't really tell cause its dark in the place 
 So I'm watching shorty quietly 
 And I'm thinkin' to myself should I chill or should I chase 
 I could tell by the way she looked at me 
 She was somebody who could be 
 The type that I need in my world
