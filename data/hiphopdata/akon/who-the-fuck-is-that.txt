 Especailly the strip club 
 Let me talk to 'em T-Pain

 Konvict let me

 I hit the club with a mug 
 So mean got them niggas 
 Like who the fuck is that 
 Then I hop up out the car 
 So clean got them hoes 
 Like who the fuck is that 
 Hit da door like right 
 Left back fourth 
 Yeah, I got money nigga 
 That's of cousrse 
 Hit the stage 
 With a b-boi stance 
 The club owner like 
 Who the fuck is that 
 Pull up in something 
 Tented 200 on the dash 
 Y'all shit rented 
 I drop cash 
 Watch the doors lift up 
 This nigga then went mad 
 I'm wat you never had 
 Some of this some of that 
 Tell that bitch 
 To give me kiss 
 Then I smack her on ass 
 Throw a stack 
 At her and laugh 
 This shit to me 
 Ain't nothing 
 How much money do you have? 
 That's not up for discussion 
 I be mashin out 
 Wih something European 
 On them buttons 
 I been rich since I was 11 
 My grams look 
 Like 7's my killers 
 Look like reverends 
 Yeah you better count 
 Yo blessings 
 Convict piece around my neck 
 Misdameter on my risk 
 Got a fellon on my pinky 
 Got you blinking when it glince 
 I got strippers on a payroll 
 Charges in Diego 
 Ya-yo like it's Mayo 
 Don't play around with me Paso 
 You should see the stello 
 Neighborhood nino 
 Bithces call me Dolla 
 But these niggas call me D-Bo 
 Akon: 
 Niggas that you ever saw 
 Don't make me have to come 
 Around and spray at all y'all 
 The world so small 
 It's big as a golf ball 
 Just like them perfect titties 
 It's pressing against the wall 
 And while we tossing dollars 
 They be staring at my team 
 You wishing that a nigga 
 Had looking so clean 
 Track jacket on my back 
 Looking mint green 
 Hanging off my ass 
 It's some konvict jeans 
 Your no longer better 
 You're in a lot of chedder 
 No matter how 
 Ya look at it bet 
 I can do it better 
 No need for lookin' better 
 Like a glass of armmeretter 
 Got a lil Vendetta 
 Then bring out 
 The heavy metel 
 Pull up on that trigger 
 Like I'm pulling on 
 These hoes 
 After magic city 
 Nigga anything goes 
 So impateint 
 Can't wait to club close 
 I'll be in the lambo 
 Poppin' side ya don 
 Dolla: 
 I'm shinning 
 Like a motherfucker 
 Vvs it blanking 
 Steve earkle by the tongue 
 That purple steady stankin 
 You talking yo the deckin 
 I got swag I got juice 
 See me in that bentley coupe 
 Right from runnin' shoot 
 You be running when I shoot 
 I be shooting where you running 
 'Kon got me out the streets 
 Told me dolla get the money 
 Now I'm the club 
 Stuntning like la, la, la, la 
 Laughing at these cow niggas 
 Like ha, ha, ha, ha 
 Look you fucking with a winner 
 Stripping lobster for dinner 
 Bet you any game 
 You other just beginners 
 In my d-oy stancebout 
 To pop a rubber band 
 Fuck that fighting in the club 
 You nigga fuckin' up my plans 
 I'm tryna get a dance her name 
 And her number taker her 
 To the telly get some brain 
 In the hummer 
 You niggas make it rain my dollar 
 Make it thunder album coming soon 
 Bitch get ready for the summer
