Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto we livin' 
 These streets remind me of quicksand (quicksand) 
 When you're on it you'll keep goin' down (goin' down) 
 And there's no one to hold on too 
 And there's no one to pull you out 
 You keep on fallin' (fallin') 
 And no one can hear you callin' 
 So you end up self destructing 
 On the corner with the tuli on the waist line 
 Just got outta the bing doin' state time 
 Teeth marks on my back from the K9 
 Dark memories of when there was no sunshine 
 'Cause they said that I wouldn't make it 
 (I remember like yesterday) 
 Holdin' on to what God gave me 
 'Cause that's the life when you're 
 Livin' in the (ghetto) 
 And eatin' in the (ghetto) 
 Or sleepin' in the (ghetto, ghetto) 
 That's the life when you're 
 Livin' in the (ghetto) 
 And eatin' in the (ghetto) 
 Or sleepin' in the (ghetto, ghetto, ghetto) 
 No need to cherish luxuries ('cause everythin' come and go) 
 Even the life that you have is borrowed 
 ('Cause you're not promised tomorrow) 
 So live your life as if every day's gon' be your last 
 Once you move forward can't go back 
 Best prepare to remove your past 
 'Cause ya gotta be willin' to pray 
 Yeah there gotta be (there gotta be) a better way oh 
 Yeah ya gotta be willin' to pray 
 'Cause there gotta be (there gotta be) a better day (ay) 
 Whoever said that this struggle would stop today 
 A lot of niggas dead or locked away 
 Teenage women growing up with aids 
 'Cause that's the life when you're 
 Livin' in the (ghetto) 
 And eatin' in the (ghetto) 
 Or sleepin' in the (ghetto, ghetto) 
 That's the life when you're 
 Livin' in the (ghetto) 
 And eatin' in the (ghetto) 
 Or sleepin' in the (ghetto, ghetto, ghetto) 
 Gun shots every night in the (ghetto) 
 Crooked cops on sight in the (ghetto) 
 Every day is a fight in the (ghetto) 
 (Oh oh oh oh oh ghetto) 
 Got kids to feed in the (ghetto) 
 Sellin' coke and weed in the (ghetto) 
 Every day somebody bleedin' in the (ghetto) 
 (Oh oh oh oh oh ghetto) 
 'Cause that's the life when you're 
 Livin' in the (ghetto) 
 We livin' by the (ghetto) 
 And eatin' in the (ghetto, ghetto) 
 'Cause that's the life you're 
 Livin' in the (ghetto) 
 And sleepin' by the (ghetto) 
 Livin' in the (ghetto, ghetto, ghetto) 
 (Wooohooh)
