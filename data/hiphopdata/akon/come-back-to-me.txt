Going crazy my heart is breaking 
 I can't sleep at all 
 Trying to get throught this 
 Don't know how I'll do this 
 I know that I only got my self to blame (only got myself to blame) 
 But that doesn't help to ease the pain (doesn't help to ease the pain) 
 I'll just die if I can't see your face 
 Until you come back 
 I can't breath 
 Until you come back 
 I got no reason 
 Got my heart, my heart down on it's knees 
 I still need you beside me 
 Now it's morning 
 Your still gone and 
 I still reach for you (still reach for you) 
 Don't know how to 
 Live without you 
 I will, I can take back all the hurt I've caused 
 (Take back all the hurt I've caused) 
 If I could give back all the love I lost 
 (Give back all the love I lost) 
 The price I pay is just to high of a cost yeah 
 Until you come back 
 I can't breath 
 Until you come back 
 I got no reason 
 Got my heart, my heart down on it's knees 
 I still need you beside me 
 Please forgive me (forgive me) 
 If we had one more chance in your life (one more chance in your life) 
 Till you're with me 
 I'll be half a life until you come back (back back) 
 Until you come back 
 I can't breath 
 Until you come back 
 I got no reason 
 Got my heart, my heart down on it's knees 
 'Cause I need you beside me 
 Until you come back 
 I can't breath 
 Until you come back 
 I got no reason 
 Got my heart, my heart down on it's knees 
 I still need you beside beside beside beside me
