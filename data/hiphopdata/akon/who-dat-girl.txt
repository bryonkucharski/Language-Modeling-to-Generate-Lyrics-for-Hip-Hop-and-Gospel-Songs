Hey, Ms. Red Carpet 
 She can autograph my pockets, 
 Anytime, anyplace, anyway, 
 I'll be looking at everybody else watchin' 
 I don't wanna be obnoxious, 
 But this girl worth the gossip, 
 Take away the smile, 
 The tattoos now, forever she very guard-less 
 I imagine her topless 
 She might set off my rocket 
 Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one 
 On and poppin' she mad marketing 
 Attitude like we arguing 
 With her by my side bring glitter to my life 
 I should twitter this girl is sparkling 
 She ain't no rock star 
 But she got groupies, 
 She ain't no actress 
 But she makes movies, 
 And when she struts that thing around 
 Everybody be breaking their neck like 
 Who dat girl who dat girl, who dat girl 
 She ain't got riches but she got fashion, 
 She ain't a model but camera's flashing 
 And when she struts that thing around 
 Everybody be breaking their neck like 
 Who dat girl who dat girl, who dat girl 
 Hey, I wanna know her mamma's name, 
 'Cause that where she get it from, 
 They ain't never shot her with silicon, 
 Shawty is her and her she's the real one 
 Touch one, grab one, feel one, 
 I wish she would'a told me that 
 Ain't nothing wrong bringing the old me back, 
 Little mamma knows my body so trophy glass, 
 She worth it, bring me some Chloe bags 
 Like damn, can I be yo' police badge 
 Pull it up, get a little cozy and 
 Woman is sort'a like and oldie jam, 
 Record some ssh, 
 On a playboy cam, 
 She ain't no actress 
 The movie from my mattress 
 Rock star, none of that practice 
 But still she got fanatics 
 Ooh oh oh, look at her goo ooh ooh, 
 I wanna know ooh ooh 
 Who dat girl who dat girl, who dat girl 
 Ooh oh oh, look at her goo ooh ooh, 
 I wanna know ooh ooh 
 Who dat girl who dat girl, who dat girl
