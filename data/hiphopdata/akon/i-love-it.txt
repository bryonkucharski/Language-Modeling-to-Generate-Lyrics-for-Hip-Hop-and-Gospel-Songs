 What's love gotta do with it 
 Gotta do with it, gotta do with it? 
 What's love gotta do with it 
 Gotta do with it, gotta do with it? 
 What's love? 
 That's it, can't take no more 
 I'm leavin'?, got one foot through the door 
 (But I love you) 
 I had my doubts before 
 I thought it through, now I'm gone for sure 
 (But I love you) 
 Can't let you tie me down 
 I wanna have fun and mess around 
 (But I love you) 
 I gotta stand my ground 
 Though you're the best thing I found 
 What's love gotta do with it 
 Gotta do with it, gotta do with it? 
 What's love gotta do with it 
 Gotta do with it, gotta do with it? 
 What's love? 
 I hope for goodness sake 
 That you would just cheat, make some mistake 
 (But I love you) 
 So perfect, ??? 
 You gave me no reason to escape 
 (But I love) 
 Won't hide, I got skirts to chase 
 Don't wanna be thrownin' it in your face 
 (But I love) 
 I pray for God some days 
 We fight and go our separate ways 
 What's love gotta do with it 
 Gotta do with it, gotta do with it? 
 What's love gotta do with it 
 Gotta do with it, gotta do with it? 
 What's love?

 Me waan fi leave you long time 
 Enuff of men a them search for your sign 
 Say that she love me till the end of time 
 But that I not really have pon me mind 
 What's love gotta do with it 
 Gotta do with it, gotta do with it? 
 What's love gotta do with it 
 Gotta do with it, gotta do with it?
