 How many days we gonna live our life struggling on the streets 
 How many days we gotta live our life searching for a way to eat 
 You gotta stay down stay down just to see a brighter day 
 Stay down stay down just to live a better way 
 Stay down stay down just to live a brighter day 
 Stay down stay down just to live a better way 
 (Flashy Verse 1) 
 How many blacks gotta die by the hands of another 
 Don't you understand that man's the same color so that man is your brother 
 That's what happens when that man is from the gutter 
 And that man is a hustler trying to survive, moving grams of that butter 
 See, his momma was a dope fiend, poppa was a rolling stone 
 He never knew what family was he grew up in a broken home 
 Ever since twelve years old he was known as grown 
 'Cause ever since twelve years old he was on his own 
 And even though it seemed like school was the best plan 
 His only choice was distributing the rock like Def-jam 
 While everybody else was getting diplomas 
 He graduated from the middle of the strip to the corner 
 But I don't knock him 'cause he tryin' to bubble 
 There's no food on the table, the rents past due and that's why he hustles 
 And I ain't sayin' that its right to be dealin' 
 All I'm sayin' is I feel him I guess 
 I just see eye 2 eye wit his struggle you know

 (Flashy Verse 2) 
 Now baby girl's got a promising future 
 But her moms passed away while she was younger and her father's a loser 
 He'd always abused her but what else you expect from a coward 
 He wasn't even proud when she got accepted to Howard 
 And even though she loves college everyday it would stress her 
 But it wasn't cause of exams or she hate her professor 
 It was her financial situation here she couldn't pay a semester 
 And the only means of making it better was totally reversing the role 
 Lap dancing working that pole even though deep down its hurting her soul 
 And even if it meant taking off her clothes 
 She was down for what ever to help her accomplish her personal goals 
 And I ain't trippin' off a-how shortie livin' 
 She gotta pay her tuiton put food in the kitchen and that's why she strippin 
 And I ain't sayin' I agree with her job but shit times is hard 
 I guess I just see eye to eye with her vision you know

 (Flashy Verse 3) 
 Now see the moral of the story is this 
 If you ain't tryin' to help stop our troubles then don't knock our hustle 
 Cause really at the end of the day it's not y'all struggle 
 But you always got something to say 
 Well hear this fuck you 
 Yeah that's right I'm talking to you come try to sleep in our beds 
 Eat off our plates, take a walk in our shoes 
 Look at the world from our view try to live by our rules 
 Drink the same water we do, put your kids in our schools 
 I guarantee you won't maintain your health you'll probably try to end it all 
 And hang yourself or bang yourself 
 You couldn't possibly understand all pain we felt 
 And without folding your hands play the games we dealt 
 I'm being real I ain't tryin' to be evil 
 Look how we live, look how y'all live 
 C'mon be serious how is we equal 
 Matter fact I feel I'm wasting my time 
 I'm finished writing this rhyme 
 Y'all never gonna see eye to eye with my people you know
