I won't 
 I won't 
 I won't 
 I wooon't 
 'Cause I came too far 
 Tryin' to know what's goin' on 
 Echoes on my celluar phone 
 I noticed a couple items missing 
 Could it be the FEDS still listening? 
 See I done beat those cases 
 Dead time for the miscellaneous 
 And they proceed to keep on watching 
 'Cause I done seen them lately 
 Interrogated my mom 
 Locked up half of my crew! 
 But I can guarantee one thing that I won't let you do! 
 I Wont let you lock me down 
 I Wont let you push me 'round 
 I Wont Let you stop me now 
 I Wooont, 'cause I came too far 
 I Wont let you ruin my day 
 I won't let you stop my pain 
 I won't, no not today! 
 I woont, 'cause I came too far 
 Devil's always watching me (watching me) 
 Evil's always stocking me (stalking me) 
 God has been protecting me (protecting me) 
 And that's how I got this far 
 'Cause when you look at me you see an angel 
 Can't believe I been through half the things that I went through 
 Cause everyday I see your face (my face) 
 Keep gettin' screwed by the human race (my race) 
 So, please don't you judge me unless you know me 
 'Cause I won't let you... 
 I won't let you lock me down 
 I won't let you push me 'round 
 I won't let you stop me now 
 I wooon't, 'cause I came too far 
 I won't let you ruin my day 
 I won't let you stop my pain 
 I won't, no not today! 
 I woon't, 'cause I came too far 
 Came too far to turn back now (too far) 
 Came too Far to turn back now (too far) 
 Ain't no body gonna stop me (can't stop) 
 Ain't no body gonna stop me (can't stop) 
 I won't let you lock me down 
 I won't let you push me 'round 
 I won't let you stop me now 
 I wooont, 'cause I came too far 
 I won't let you ruin my day 
 I won't let you stop my pain 
 I won't, no not today! 
 I woon't, 'cause I came too far
