Eh eh eh eh eh 
 Oh 
 I know they wanna come and separate us but they can't do us nothin' 
 Your the one I want and I'm a continue lovin' 
 Cause your considered wify and I'm considered husband 
 And I'm a always be there for you 
 And either way you look at it I ain't goin' no where from my muffin 
 'Cause she gonna hold it down, can't no body tell her nothin' 
 You got the kind of love that always make up after fussin 
 And that's what gets me closer to you 
 And no one knows 
 Why I'm into you 
 'Cause you'll never know what it's like to walk in our shoes 
 And no one know, the things we've been through 
 Can never measure up to half of what I put you through 
 That's why we'll break through 
 And I don't care what they say 
 I'm gonna be with you 
 I'm gonna be with you 
 I wanna be with you 
 And I don't care what they do 
 I'm gonna be with you 
 I'm gonna be with you 
 I'm gonna be with you 
 Seems like every day that go by things are gettin' harder 
 Want to be the one that give you the whole enchilada 
 'Cause I know what my baby like, I lean you on that Prada 
 You ain't got to match with the shoes 
 All about knowing you I'm into doing things to keep her longer 
 Stickin together forever, watch you grow stronger 
 That's the way it has to be, everything problem 
 Keepin' it always true 
 And no one knows 
 What I'm into you 
 'Cause you'll never know what it's like to walk in our shoes 
 And no one know, the things we've been through 
 Can never measure up to half of what I put you through 
 That's why we'll break through 
 And I don't care what they say 
 I'm gonna be with you 
 I'm gonna be with you 
 I wanna be with you 
 And I don't care what they do 
 I'm gonna be with you 
 I'm gonna be with you 
 I'm gonna be with you 
 You are everything in my life see the joy you bring 
 And ain't no one I compare you to 
 And I know that you will never walk away from me no matter what 
 And that's why I plan to do the same thing for you 
 And I want you to know 
 And I don't care what they say 
 I'm gonna be with you 
 I'm gonna be with you 
 I wanna be with you 
 And I don't care what they do 
 I'm gonna be with you 
 I'm gonna be with you 
 I'm gonna be with you 
 And I don't care what they say 
 I'm gonna be with you 
 I'm gonna be with you 
 I wanna be with you 
 And I don't care what they do 
 I'm gonna be with you 
 I'm gonna be with you 
 I'm gonna be with you
