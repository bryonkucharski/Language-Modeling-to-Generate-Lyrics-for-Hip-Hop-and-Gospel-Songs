DJ Drama! 
 Akon! 
 T.I.! 
 Snoop Dogg! 
 [Akon]: 
 Shirley temple on ice, 
 She makes it just right, 
 That extra grenadine got me feelin' so nice 
 Her body's so tight up under that light, 
 I see her so clearly now, she's right there before my eyes 
 [Chorus - Akon]: 
 Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer (dancer) 
 She got me wander'n now 
 Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer (dancer) 
 She got me day dreamin' 
 (Left and right, watch her goin' up and down, all night) 
 Yes I'm day dreamin' 
 (Left and right, watch her goin' up and down, all night) 
 She got me day dreamin' 
 (Left and right, watch her goin' up and down, all night) 
 Yes I'm day dreamin' 
 (Left and right, watch her goin' up and down, all night) 
 [Verse 1 - Snoop Dogg]: 
 5 foot 8 on the late what a date, she fell for the hook and the bait, 
 I took her to the yacht, the shrimp and steak 
 Then I took her to the gym so she could get in shape 
 No more drama, just late night thrills 
 Nigga in the hood with the gangsta grillz 
 Fillin out stacks of bills, jaguar like Jacksonville, 
 Bringing these hoes like Jacks and Jill 
 [Chorus - Akon]: 
 Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer (dancer) 
 She got me wander'n now 
 Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer (dancer) 
 She got me day dreamin' 
 (Left and right, watch her goin' up and down, all night) 
 Yes I'm day dreamin' 
 (Left and right, watch her goin' up and down, all night) 
 She got me day dreamin' 
 (Left and right, watch her goin' up and down, all night) 
 Yes I'm day dreamin' 
 (Left and right, watch her goin' up and down, all night) 
 [Verse 2 - Akon]: 
 I'm looking at the most beautiful thang in the world (world, world, world) 
 Her body's so perfect and spinin like a cinnamon swirl (swirl, swirl, swirl) 
 She looks like a fairy tale, but yet feels so natural (natural, natural, natural) 
 This one's a beast, but way to wonderful to be compared to an animal 
 She's like what I'm sippin on Shirley temple on ice, 
 She makes it just right, 
 That extra grenadine got me feelin' so nice 
 Her bodies so tight up under that light, 
 I see her so clearly now, she's right there before my eyes 
 (Verse 3 - T.I.) 
 Hey I sit and gaze hazy eyed as I day dream 
 Her 'n' her girls on the stage doin' they thing 
 Double D's full of silicon and saline 
 She thirty but look only a day over 18 
 Her booty big enough to swallow up a g-string 
 Hey gon put that ass on me like a bee sting 
 Hey let the King on, beat it like a tambourine 
 And peel ya out ya jeans and eat it like a tangerine 
 I see her face down, ass high 
 Make everybody throw that cash high, 
 Back in the club already 
 She stuck in my head since last night, 
 That's right, girl you got my dreams so, 
 Sexy when I sleep, 
 No more fantasies I want the real thing. 
 [Chorus - Akon]: 
 Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer (dancer) 
 She got me wander'n now 
 Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer (dancer) 
 She got me day dreamin' 
 (Left and right, watch her goin' up and down, all night) 
 Yes I'm day dreamin' 
 (Left and right, watch her goin' up and down, all night) 
 She got me day dreamin' 
 (Left and right, watch her goin' up and down, all night) 
 Yes I'm day dreamin' 
 (Left and right, watch her goin' up and down, all night)
