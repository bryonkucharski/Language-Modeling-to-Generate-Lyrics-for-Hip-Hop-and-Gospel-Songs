Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
 It's not warm when she's away 
 Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
 She's gone much too long 
 Any time she goes away 
 Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
 Wonder if she's gone to stay 
 Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
 And this house just ain't no home 
 Anytime she goes away 
 I know 
 She's gone to stay 
 It's breakin' me up 
 Anytime she goes away 
 Gotta leave the young thing alone 
 There ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
 Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
 It's not warm when she's away 
 Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
 And she's gone much too long 
 Any time she goes away 
 Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
 I wonder if she's gone to stay 
 There ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
 And this house just ain't a home 
 Any time she goes away 
 I know 
 She's gone to stay 
 It's breaking me up 
 Any time she goes away 
 Gotta leave the young thing alone 
 There ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
 Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
 I wonder if she's gone to stay 
 Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
 And this house just ain't no home 
 Any time she goes away 
 Any time she goes away
