Konvict (Konvict) 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Just one look in the mirror 
 And I know I don't look the same being alone 
 I don't walk the same without you on my arm, I lost my charm 
 I don't know how I made it before 
 'Cause you are my future for sure 
 And now that it's over I don't know how I'm gonna get by 
 With no more you x2 
 What am I gonna do? 
 With no more you 
 To see me through, 
 With no more you 
 What am I gonna do? 
 With no more you 
 Can't believe there's no more you 
 I look at my passenger side 
 And there's nobody to ride with me for life 
 It feels like the end, I lost my friend 
 I can't sleep at night, 
 Because your side ain't occupied 
 The hurt in my eyes, won't go away 
 I'm in so much pain 
 With no more you x2 
 What am I gonna do? 
 There's no more you 
 To see me through, 
 With no more you 
 What am I gonna do? 
 There's no more you 
 Can't believe there's no more you 
 Don't know if I can make it or not 
 Everybody sees that I'm going through a lot 
 It's hard being alone, 
 When you used to be on top 
 Call for you, there's no more you 
 I stop for a minute then I pinch myself 
 I can't believe I'm here by myself 
 I can't do anything without your help. 
 Call for you, there's no more you... Oh 
 With no more you 
 What am I gonna do? 
 There's no more you 
 To see me through, 
 With no more you 
 What am I gonna do? 
 There's no more you 
 Can't believe there's no more you 
 No more you 
 What am I gonna do, 
 There's no more you 
 To see me through, 
 No more you... 
 What am I gonna do, 
 There's no more you 
 Can't believe there's no more you (x3)
