Uh, 
 Hit them with a lil' ghetto gospel 
 Yeah! Ma Ghetto Gospel! 
 Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin' 
 (2Pac) 
 If I could recollect before my hood days 
 I'd sit and reminisce, nigga and bliss on the good days 
 I stop and stare at the younger, my heart goes to 'em 
 They tested, it was stressed that they under 
 We never really went threw that 'cause we was born B.C u n me b4 crack 
 In our days, things changed 
 Everyone's ashamed to the youth 'cause the truth looks strange 
 And for me it's reversed, we left them a world that's cursed, and it hurts 
 Cause any day they'll push the button 
 And y'all condemned like Malcolm x and Bobby Hunton, died for nothin' 
 Don't them let me get teary, the world looks dreary 
 But when you wipe your eyes, see it clearly 
 There's no need for you to fear me 
 If you take the time to hear me, maybe you can learn to cheer me 
 It ain't about black or white, 'cause we're human 
 I hope we see the light before its ruined 
 My ghetto gospel 
 (Akon) 
 Whoever said that this struggle would stop today 
 A lot of niggas dead or locked away 
 Teenage Women growing up with aids 
 Cause that's the life when your 
 Living in the (ghetto) 
 Or eating in the (ghetto) 
 Or sleeping in the (ghetto, ghetto) 
 That's the life when your 
 Living in the (ghetto) 
 Or eating in the (ghetto) 
 Or sleeping in the (ghetto, ghetto, ghetto)

 Tell me do you see that old lady ain't it sad 
 Living out a bag, but she's glad for the little things she has 
 And over there there's a lady, crack got her crazy 
 Guess she's given birth to a baby 
 I don't trip and let it fade me, from outta the frying pan 
 We jump into another form of slavery 
 Even now I keep discouraged 
 Wonder if they take it all back while I still keep the courage 
 I refuse to be a role model 
 I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottle 
 I make mistakes, I learn from everyone 
 And when its said and done 
 I bet this brotha be a better one 
 If I'm upset, you don't stress 
 Never forget, that God hasn't finished with me yet 
 I feel his hand on my brain 
 When I write rhymes, I go blind, and let the lord do his thang 
 But am I less holy 
 'Cause I choose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies 
 Before we find world peace 
 We gotta find peace in that war on the streets 
 My ghetto gospel
