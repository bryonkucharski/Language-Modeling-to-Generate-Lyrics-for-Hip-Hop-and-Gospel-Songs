 (Obie Trice) 
 Whatchu gonna do with it A? 
 Whatchu gonna do? 
 (Akon) 
 Take 'em on back to the street 
 (Chrous: Akon) 
 I keep the 40 cal on my side 
 Steppin with the mindstate of a mobster 
 You see a nigga pass by 
 Tuck your chain in 'cause he might rob ya 
 Got glocks for sale, RED tops for sale 
 Anything that you need, believe me I'm gon' lace you, Yeah 
 Just don't, whatever you do, snitch 
 Cause you will get hit, pray, I don't face you, Yeah 
 (Verse 1: Obie Trice) 
 That's risky, the bitch tenderize out a nigga 
 His history's snitch, who decided he's a member? 
 Once he got pinched, coincided with law 
 Same homie say he lay it down for the bar 
 Brought gang squad around ours 
 How could it be? 
 Been homies since superman draws 
 Only phoniness never came to par 
 He had us, a true neighborhood actor 
 Had his back with ks, now we see through him like X-Rays 
 Cuffed in that Adam car, no matter his loss 
 We at 'em, it's war 
 Knowin' not to cross those reservoir dogs 
 You help to plant seeds, just to be a vegetable? 
 When we invest in team, its to the death for sho' 
 No X and O's, tex calicos 
 Aimed at your chest nigga 
 (Chorus: Akon) 
 I keep the 40 cal on my side 
 Steppin with the mindstate of a mobster 
 Ya see a nigga pass by 
 Tuck your chain in 'cause he might rob ya 
 Got glocks for sale, red tops for sale 
 Anything that you need, believe me I'm gon' lace you Yeah 
 Just don't, whatever you do, snitch 
 Cause you will get hit, pray, I don't face you, Yeah 
 (Verse 2: Obie Trice) 
 We started out as a crew, when one speak, it's all honest 
 Private conferences when we eat, Benihana's 
 Recondences when we peep enemies on us 
 Been in these corners 
 Sellin' like anything on us 
 Knowing heaven'll shun us being devil's miners 
 But that ain't got shit to do with the tea in China 
 We gon' keep the grind up till death can find us 
 Mean time, leanin in them European whips reclined up 
 It's eye for an eye for the riders 
 We ain't trying to get locked up, we Soul Survivors 
 Po Po's is cowards, its no you, its ours 
 We vow this, mixing Yayo with soda powder 
 Who woulda known he would fold and cower 
 Once the captain showed, he sold Old McDonalds 
 No X and O's, tex calicos 
 Aimed at your chest nigga 
 (Chorus: Akon) 
 I keep the 40 cal on my side 
 Steppin with the mindstate of a mobster 
 You see a nigga pass by 
 Tuck your chain in 'cause he might rob ya 
 Got glocks for sale, red tops for sale 
 Anything that you need, believe me I'm gon' lace you 
 Just don't, whatever you do, snitch 
 Cause you will get hit, pray, I don't face you, Yeah 
 (Verse 3: Obie Trice) 
 Nowadays, Sammy the Bull's, got the game full 
 So he moved to a rural area to keep cool 
 They snitchin on the snitch now, it's nothing to tell 
 Nowadays your circle should be small as hell 
 Ain't tryin' to meet new faces, this don't interest me 
 Even if we bubble slow, we get it eventually 
 No penitentiary, though we know clemecy 
 You will meet the lord snitchin, given us a century 
 These cats is rats now, the streets need decon 
 That's how they react now, weak, when the heat's on them 
 Stop snitchen, you asked for the life you live in 
 This act is not permitted, no where on the map 
 It is forbidden to send a nigga to prison 
 If you've been in it along with 'em 
 And then snitch and become hidden 
 No X and O's, tex calicos 
 Aimed at your chest nigga. 
 (Chorus: Akon) 
 I keep the 40 cal on my side 
 Steppin with the mindstate of a mobster 
 You see a nigga pass by 
 Tuck your chain in 'cause he might rob ya 
 Got glocks for sale, red tops for sale 
 Anything that you need, believe me I'm gon' lace you 
 Just don't, whatever you do, snitch 
 Cause you will get hit, pray, I don't face you, Yeah 
 (Obie Trice) 
 You rat bastard! (bastard) (echo)
