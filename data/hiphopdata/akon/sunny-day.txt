Who'd ever thought that I would see this day... 
 Where I would see my ghetto life fade away... 
 'Cause I was lost and couldn't find a way... 
 And now I look forward to every day...(welcome to my sunny day)... 
 Block don't stop always stayed hot... 
 No matter how the seasons got... 
 I still remember when they took me away... 
 Kept it on lock den I got cuaght den I realised dat I had to stop... 
 Den I took the time to explore a better way... 
 Searched high and low, so close, yet so far to go... 
 I just know, there's a sunny day 
 Who'd ever thought that I would see this day... 
 Where I would see my ghetto life fade away... 
 'Cause I was lost and couldn't find a way... 
 And now I look forward to every day... 
 Welcome to my sunny day... 
 My sunny day... 
 Everyday... 
 A better day... 
 Welcome to my sunny day... 
 My sunny day... 
 Every day... 
 A better day... 
 Welcome to my sunny day... 
 Been a long day... 
 On my way to my holy place to pray... 
 Give thanks for every blessing given to me... 
 I know there's more to see... more to me... no more living in misery... 
 'Cause this is how I visioned life to beee... 
 Searched high and low, so close, yet so far to go... 
 I just know, there's a sunny day 
 Who'd ever thought that I would see this day... 
 Where I would see my ghetto life fade away... 
 'Cause I was lost and couldn't find a way... 
 And now I look forward to every day... 
 Welcome to my sunny day... 
 My sunny day... 
 Everyday... 
 A better day... 
 Welcome to my sunny day... 
 My sunny day... 
 Every day... 
 A better day... 
 Welcome to my sunny day...
