I met her on the walk way 
 Stared as she walked pass 
 She looked back at me side ways and said 
 I can't help but to ask 
 I said you wanna be startin' somethin' 
 You got to be startin' somethin' 
 I said you wanna be startin' somethin' 
 You got to be startin' somethin' 
 We end up going back to her place 
 Wish I could tell you what I saw 
 The sexiest women in a negligee 
 We hit off until the mornning 
 Until you hear her say 
 (AKON) 
 Mama se, 
 Mama sa, mama coo sa 
 Mama se, mama sa, 
 Mama coo sa x10

 Billie Jean Is Always Talkin' 
 When Nobody Else Is Talkin' 
 Tellin' Lies And Rubbin' Shoulders 
 So They Called Her Mouth A Motor 
 Someone's Always Tryin' To Start My Baby Cryin' 
 Talkin', Squealin', lyin' 
 Sayin' You Just Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' 
 (AKON) 
 I said you wanna be startin' somethin', 
 You got to be startin' somethin'. 
 I said you wanna be startin' somethin', 
 You got to be startin' somethin' 
 It's too high to get over,(YEA YEA) 
 Too low to get under.(YEA YEA) 
 You're stuck in the middle (YEA YEA) 
 And the pain is thunder.(YEA YEA) 
 It's too high to get over,(YEA YEA) 
 Too low to get under.(YEA YEA) 
 You're stuck in the middle (YEA YEA) 
 And the pain is thunder (YEA YEA)

 You love to pretend that you're good 
 When you're always up to no good 
 You really can't make him hate her 
 So your tongue became a razor 
 Someone's always tryin' to start my baby crying 
 Talkin', squealin', lyin' you got my baby crying 
 (AKON) 
 I said you wanna be startin' somethin', 
 You got to be startin' somethin'. 
 I said you wanna be startin' somethin', 
 You got to be startin' somethin' 
 It's too high to get over,(YEA YEA) 
 Too low to get under.(YEA YEA) 
 You're stuck in the middle (YEA YEA) 
 And the pain is thunder.(YEA YEA) 
 It's too high to get over, (YEA YEA) 
 Too low to get under.(YEA YEA) 
 You're stuck in the middle (YEA YEA) 
 And the pain is thunder (YEA YEA)

 Mama se,

 What did I make her say 
 (AKON) 
 Is getting a lil crazy (is getting lil crazy) 
 Always messing with my baby (messing with my baby) 
 And that's the reason she cries is 
 When I am not by her side 
 At the lonliest night (without my baby) 
 But I love how you 
 Always pompin when I'm thinkin' about you 
 I wanna bring back the night and share that look on your face 
 When you say
