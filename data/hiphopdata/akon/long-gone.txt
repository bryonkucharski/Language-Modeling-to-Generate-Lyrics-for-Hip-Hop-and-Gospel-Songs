Akon: 
 I used to tell my homie 
 Slow down time after time 
 But he never would listen 
 Until he got some time 
 The life that he was living 
 I knew it wasn't right 
 The judge gave him that sentence 
 And put him up for life 
 You don't miss the water 
 Till the well runs dry 
 Don't miss the living till they die 
 Don't know the reason 
 Don't know why 
 We just let life pass us by 
 Cause you never know (never know) 
 What you got (what you got) 
 Until it's gone (gone away) 
 Away away away away 
 Long long gone 
 Cause you never know (never know) 
 What you got (what you got) 
 Until it's gone away 
 Away away away away 
 Long long gone 
 Rock City: 
 See my best friend used to stay with me 
 Each and every day he'd chill with me 
 Always told me to pray for me 
 But I always thought that he'll be fine 
 Now I got to watch his mother cry 
 'Cause she loved him child 
 Don't miss the water 
 Till the well runs dry 
 Don't miss the living till they die 
 Don't know the reason 
 Don't know why 
 We just let life pass us by. 
 Cause you never know (never know) 
 What you got (what you got) 
 Until it's gone away 
 Away away away away 
 Long long gone 
 Cause you never know (never know) 
 What you got (what you got) 
 Until it's gone away 
 Away away away away 
 Long long gone 
 So don't you take for granted 
 The life you've been handed 
 Be thankful and grateful 
 Cause life goes on 
 With or without you 
 Plus there's so many people worse off than you 
 With no chance of changing 
 It's truly up to you 
 Cause you never know (never know) 
 What you got (what you got) 
 Until it's gone away 
 Away away away away 
 Long long gone 
 Cause you never know (never know) 
 What you got (what you got) 
 Until it's gone away 
 Away away away away 
 Long long gone
