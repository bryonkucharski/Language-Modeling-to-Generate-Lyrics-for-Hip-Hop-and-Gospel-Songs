See I'm a real G from head to toe 
 The whole West Coast to let you know 
 Got a floor that seeks Namonia 
 Never will I live California 
 Poppin', scrapes, scrapin, old school swanging, triple gold degons 
 Hustlers hustle gangsters banging 
 Whatch fo colour you wear and watch for you hangin' 
 Whatch for you claiming its B's and C's 
 This is G's is more than palm trees and weed 
 Is more than movie stars and models 
 Is more than Holleywood Boulevard and Roscoes 
 More like east-side browns pat and vato 
 Take it up north to the bay when we ghosts ride out locs 
 Your boy flow colder Tahoe then Robie out Roscoes got a pacaralo 
 Side show 24's on this shure box 
 Gass stepped brake everybody shake it real lops 
 And give it up for Mac Dre and Pac 
 All eyez on that heify move me call it baywatch 
 And I'm youck hasselhoff the boss 
 24's on the porsche yeah it cost a floss 
 Venn this bitch that you brought yeah sho toss the boss 
 Was the chicken straight without the sauce? 
 Take it off 
 Westside westside G's throw your setzi 
 And represent from felix midgeon tooky 
 To my dudes in the pen[itenciary] to my youngsters in groovy 
 Ice cubes on my neck pack a mac10 uzzy 
 Only pussy vertical high like AMG 
 Cause its funky enough like DOC 
 Young duzine like Eazy-E 
 And the whole Cali will love it like Tupac and Dre 
 Top dog like SN double O P 
 Daz and Kurupt raised gin like the DPG 
 I used to pack a hammer tricked crooked eye 
 Y'all make me a rapper a hammer a crooked eye 
 I like my mommma new ports banging too shorts 
 Back in 86' when rappers all new born 
 Cool man spice one dangerous thing 
 Richie Rich for them boss 
 Niggaz slanging the cain 
 But on seat is like keep the sneak 
 We get that mailman like 40 bleed the streets 
 Out Cali... 
 REG IME LBC yeah that's me 
 I do been high since the day of dust shack 
 The hood done fashion bricks and big masters 
 Gone fresh coes got swagged your big dad 
 Gang bang started with the tribe to plee at 
 Kicked down at door ripped up the floor 
 First motherfuckers to rap for Sign Moore 
 Now be back take a look and face it 
 The Julio Cezar chapped before this rap shit 
 To inverce with my toughts I'm a classic 
 All school rap daddy on your caskets
