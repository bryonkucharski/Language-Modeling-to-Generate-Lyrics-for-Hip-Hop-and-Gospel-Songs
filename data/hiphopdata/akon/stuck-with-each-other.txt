Shontelle 
 You can, think you can get free 
 You think you won't need me 
 That you're gonna get you somethin' better, 
 But you know that we're in this forever, 
 And you can, think you can walk out 
 Even with your doubts, 
 But you know that we're in this together 
 You can try to push me from you 
 Nothing you do will keep us a part 
 Chorus : Shontelle 
 'Cause it's too late, there's no escape 
 Might as well face it, baby we're stuck with each other 
 Stuck with each other 
 Ain't nothin' you can do about it 
 It's been too long, it's been too strong 
 'Cause we belong here 
 Baby, we're stuck with each other 
 Stuck with each other 
 Stuck in love with each other 
 (Stuck in love with each other) 
 Akon 
 Yeah 
 Now I can say that I would not care 
 If you were not there, 
 Tell myself that I'll be fine without ya 
 But I would die if I was not around ya, 
 And I can try to convince you 
 I don't need to be with you, 
 But my only thoughts are thoughts about ya, 
 What can I do, love is like glue. 
 There's no way to 
 Tear us a part 
 'Cause it's too late (too late, too late) 
 There's no escape, might as well face it, 
 Baby we're stuck with each other 
 Stuck with each other (with each other) 
 Ain't nothin' I can do about it 
 It's been too long, it's been too strong 
 Yes, we belong here, 
 Baby we're stuck with each other 
 Stuck with each other (stuck with each other) 
 Stuck in love with each other 
 (Stuck in love with each other) 
 Bridge: Shontelle 
 There's nothing I'd rather do 
 Than to sit with you forever 
 Can't think of nothin' better 
 Than to be stuck with you 
 'Cause it's too late, there's no escape 
 Might as well face it, 
 Baby we're stuck with each other 
 Stuck with each other 
 Ain't nothin' we can do about it 
 Oh yeah 
 'Cause it's too late, there's no escape 
 Might as well face it, 
 Baby we're stuck with each other 
 Stuck with each other 
 Ain't nothin' I can do about it 
 It's been too long, it's been too strong 
 Yes, we belong here 
 Baby, we're stuck with each other 
 Stuck with each other 
 Stuck in love with each other 
 (Stuck in love with each other) 
 'Cause it's too late, there's no escape 
 Might as well face it, 
 Baby we're stuck with each other 
 Stuck with each other 
 Ain't nothin' we can do about it 
 It's been too long, it's been too strong 
 Yes we belong here, 
 Baby we're stuck with each other 
 Stuck with each other 
 Stuck in love with each other 
 (Stuck in love with each other) 
 Ain't nothin' gonna stop me and you ey 
 Cause you know we just stuck like glue ey 
 Akon 
 Ain't nothin' we can do 
 We stuck in love with each other
