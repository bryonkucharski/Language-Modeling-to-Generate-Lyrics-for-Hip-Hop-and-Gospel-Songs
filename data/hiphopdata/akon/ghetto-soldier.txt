Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto we livin' 
 These streets remind me of quicksand 
 When your on it you'll keep goin' down 
 And there's no one to hold on too 
 And there's no one to pull you out you keep on fallin' 
 And no one can here you callin' 
 So you end up self destructing 
 On the corner with the tuli on the waist line 
 Just got outta the bing doin' state time 
 Teeth marks on my back from the K9 
 Dark memories of when there was no sunshine 
 'Cause they said that I wouldn't make it I remember like yesterday 
 Holdin' on to what God gave me 
 'Cause that's the life when your 
 Living in the 
 (Ghetto) 
 And eating in the 
 (Ghetto) 
 Or sleeping in the 
 (Ghetto, ghetto) 
 That's the life when your 
 Living in the 
 (Ghetto) 
 And eating in the 
 (Ghetto) 
 Or sleeping in the 
 (Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto) 
 No need to cherish luxuries 'cause everythin' come and go 
 Even the life that you have is borrowed 
 'Cause your not promised tomorrow 
 So live your life as if everyday's goin' be your last 
 Once you move forward can't go back 
 Best prepare to remove your past 
 'Cause ya gotta be willin' to pray 
 Yes there gotta be there gotta be a better way 
 Yes ya gotta be willing to pray 
 'Cause there gotta be there gotta be a better day 
 Whoever said that the struggle would stop today 
 A lot of niggas dead or locked away 
 Teenage women growin' up with AID's 
 'Cause that's the life when your 
 Living in the 
 (Ghetto) 
 And eatin' in the 
 (Ghetto) 
 Or sleepin' in the 
 (Ghetto, ghetto) 
 That's the life when your 
 Livin' in the 
 (Ghetto) 
 And eatin' in the 
 (Ghetto) 
 Or sleepin' in the 
 (Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto) 
 Gun shots every night in the 
 (Ghetto) 
 Crooked cops on sight in the 
 (Ghetto) 
 Everyday is a fight in the 
 (Ghetto) 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 (Ghetto) 
 Got kids to feed in the 
 (Ghetto) 
 Sellin' coke and weed in the 
 (Ghetto) 
 Everyday somebody bleedin' in the 
 (Ghetto) 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 (Ghetto) 
 'Cause that's the life when your 
 Livin' in the 
 (Ghetto) 
 We livin' by the 
 (Ghetto) 
 And eatin' in the 
 (Ghetto, ghetto) 
 'Cause that's the life your 
 Livin' in the 
 (Ghetto) 
 And sleepin' by the 
 (Ghetto) 
 Livin' in the 
 (Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto)
