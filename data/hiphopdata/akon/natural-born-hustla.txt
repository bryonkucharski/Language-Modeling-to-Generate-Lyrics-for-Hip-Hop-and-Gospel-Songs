I'm a natural born hustla, 
 See I ain't gota tell you, 
 You can see it, 
 Every ones a customa, and with a simple conversation, 
 Ill make you believe it that I'm gona get it. 
 That you can depend, 
 Pocket full of hundred stacks my friend, 
 No g no need to pretend, 
 I'll race you by the stroke of my flow mang.
