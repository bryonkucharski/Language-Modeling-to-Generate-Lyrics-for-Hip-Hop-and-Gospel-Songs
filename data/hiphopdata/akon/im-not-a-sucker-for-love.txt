I'm not a sucker for love 
 4X 
 We're fussin' and fightin' 
 All day and nights end 
 Wondering if we ever change 
 Sittin' here thinking' 
 For one damn reason 
 Why you wanna push it away 
 I swear that I know you know 
 I never knew you 
 The shit that we've been through is not 
 The only thing that broke me down 
 Girl you should know by now 
 I should've never put my trust in you 
 So listen to me girl 
 Cause this is how it goes 
 You play me for a fool 
 I've been down that road before 
 'Cause I ain't even trying to go back to be giving everything 
 Cause ain't nothing better than reconsidering the pain 
 Now your heart is bleeding tears 
 They're falling down your face 
 Said to get a grip cause you can always be replaced 
 'Cause I ain't even trying to go back to giving you my all 
 Cause ain't nothing better than reconsidering the fall 
 I'm not a sucker for love 
 You can be my homie be my lover 
 Girl I put that on everything 
 I'm not a sucker for love (no) 
 Even though I wine you and dine you 
 And always keep you entertained 
 I'm not a sucker for love 
 Don't take my kindness for weakness 
 And then expect me to treat you the same 
 I'm not a sucker for love (no) 
 I'll drop you off on the turnpike 
 Then continue switching lanes 
 'Cause I'm all over you 
 Uh-huh 
 All over you 
 Uh-huh 
 All over you girl 
 I'm not a sucker for love (no) 
 X4 
 ('Cause I'm) 
 If there's a moment in truth in a relationship 
 You getting close to it 
 Girl I ain't trying to hear it 
 Don't try to explain 
 I give you everything 
 You're throwing it away 
 Hey hey girl 
 Now your telling you need a minute or two 
 To think about those 4 letters you said to me 
 Your pushing me to the ledge 
 Hangin' over the edge 
 And I'm about to let it go 
 So listen to me girl 
 Cause this is how it goes 
 You play me for a fool 
 I've been down that road before 
 'Cause I ain't even trying to go back to be giving everything 
 Cause ain't nothing better than reconsidering the pain 
 Now your heart is bleeding tears 
 They're falling down your face 
 Said to get a grip cause you can always be replaced 
 'Cause I ain't even trying to go back to giving you my all 
 Cause ain't nothing better than reconsidering the fall 
 I'm not a sucker for love 
 You can be my homie be my lover 
 Girl I put that on everything 
 I'm not a sucker for love (no) 
 Even though I wine you and dine you

 Oh let it breathe 
 Take it like amphetamines 
 Try to lead try to dream 
 See it as possibilities 
 Be real with me 
 Even with my ego you deal with me 
 See we close the deal you see 
 From pico to melanie 
 Giving you everything 
 Everything that you see 
 Necklace no diamonds 
 Watches no time and 
 Grinding 
 I'm a show you California's finest 
 If you trip then you letting out that demon 
 Going and buyin in 
 I'm not a sucker for love 
 You can be my homie be my lover 
 Girl I put that on everything 
 I'm not a sucker for love (no) 
 Even though I wine you and dine you 
 And always keep you entertained 
 I'm not a sucker for love 
 Don't take my kindness for weakness 
 And then expect me to treat you the same 
 I'm not a sucker for love (no) 
 (Cause no one loves you like love you) 
 I'll drop you off on the turnpike 
 Then continue switching lanes 
 'Cause I'm all over you 
 Uh-huh 
 All over you 
 Uh-huh 
 All over you girl 
 I'm not a sucker for love (no)
