My binoculars on 
 Alone staring out of my window 
 I see the best creation of woman that I ever saw in a long long time 
 Some say it is wrong, but what if she knows that I'm spying on her 
 Once she strip down naked and entertain me 
 Oh my gosh she's doin' it 
 Takin' it off [x5] 
 She's gettin' naked [x4] 
 She threw her shirt, up on a floor 
 Then threw her bra, up on a floor 
 Then threw her skirt, up on a floor 
 Then threw her dress up on a floor 
 I can't believe, she's gettin' naked [x4] 
 I wanting her, up on a floor 
 To go on top of her, up on a floor 
 There's no stoppin' her, up on a floor 
 She knows I'm watching her, up on a floor 
 I can't believe, she's gettin' naked [x4]
