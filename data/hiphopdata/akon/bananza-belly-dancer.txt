 Yo, excuse me, beg your pardon girl 
 Do you have any idea what you starting girl 
 You got me tingiling, come to me mingiling 
 Steppin off lookin' bootylicious and jingling 
 When you walk, I see you baby girl 
 When you talk, I believe it baby girl

 Little touch is a ditty 
 Love to work the kitty like purr 
 She loves to stirr it up purr 
 I can hear her purring up 
 'Cause she's the type that'll get arouse-y of 
 Get you excited and call her boyfriend up (oh)

 So stand by like a butty ass 
 While I watch this beautiful thing shake that ass

 Type to make ex-gangstas bang in here 
 Girl you could do anything you want in here 
 Clown if you want to, frown if you want to 
 You ain't even gotta drop down if you want to 
 'Cause I'd rather see you shake it standin' 
 Either way you do it girl you look outstandin' (uhhuuuh) 
 And now you got me spending (uhhuuh) 
 The way you got that body bendin' (uhhhuh) 
 Ass like that girl you gotta be kickin' 
 And we goin' to church next day repentant 
 Lap dancing for my FA crew

 Blessing you with the G even though we gettin' it free so

 Jiggle it to the front then jiggle it to the back 
 And jiggle jiggle it all all night (ah ah ah)
