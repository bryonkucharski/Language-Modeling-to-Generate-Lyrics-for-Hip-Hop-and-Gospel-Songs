Feeling like a big dog 
 Woof! Hey! 
 Feeling like a big dog 
 Woof! Hey! 
 Feeling like a big dog 
 Ever since I got bitten by my dog, things changed 
 Everything is different and my life is not the same 
 I must've been infected when he bit me on my hand 
 And now I understand why I'm feeling like a big dog 
 Feeling like a big dog 
 I can see a lot farther, I can hear a lot clearer 
 My senses getting better, transitions getting narrowed 
 I noticed that I'm chasing every cat that pass by 
 And I think I know why I'm feeling like a big dog 
 Feeling like a big dog 
 Now are you feeling like a big dog 
 Oh yeah 
 Said are you feeling like a big dog 
 Oh yeah 
 Come and shout it out, hey, out, hey, out, hey 
 Come and shout it out, hey, out, hey, out, hey 
 I can see a lot farther, I can hear a lot clearer 
 My senses getting better, transitions getting narrowed 
 I noticed that I'm chasing every cat that pass by 
 And I think I know why I'm feeling like a big dog 
 Feeling like a big dog
