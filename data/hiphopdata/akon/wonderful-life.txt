One, two, three 
 Uh yea 
 Uh oh oh 
 I hope you don't mind 
 I hope you don't mind 
 That I put down in words 
 How wonderful life like 
 Making yo momma proud, looking in yo daughter's eyes 
 Kickin' it with your sons, trippin' never realize 
 How good you got it, been so wrapped up in yo losses 
 You couldn't see the profits, could still be in the projects 
 Instead releasing projects just poppin' when niggas floppin' 
 So you went back to prison, TIP it could've been a coffin 
 Now since we talkin' you been trippin' ever since I died 
 Appreciate you missin' me but G, you still alive 
 I'm lookin' down at you, and sendin' smiles to you 
 I check the record now, oh tell Tameka hi would you 
 Told you she would get you, that's good 'cause shorty ride wit you 
 Kids getting big, seen King riding a bicycle 
 Saw Niq Niq drive a car, see Bubba big as you 
 I see Domani rappin', and he's spittin' too 
 Little Deyjah beautiful, and Major super cool 
 My life is over with dawg, your life been good to you 
 And you can tell everybody 
 This is your song 
 And you can tell everybody 
 This is your song 
 I hope you don't mind 
 I hope you don't mind 
 That I put down in words 
 How wonderful life like 
 Sit down, son 
 And listen to me son, and pay attention to me 
 Seems like I'm the only one that you would listen to 
 I never knew the time that I ain't get to spend with you 
 Would ever result in you making yourself miserable 
 You gotta let it go, it's painful, I already know 
 The past is the past, just learn from it, grow 
 So you got Crystal wit you? And your sister Precious too 
 I'm proud of you, did better than I expected you to 
 Although I knew you was special when you was smaller 
 That's why I was so much harder on you, knew you were smarter 
 Not much convo to offer, I wasn't much of a talker 
 Great to see you doin' better than me, even as a father 
 Taking care of yo mama, overcoming the drama 
 Your life is wonderful son, don't let 'em take it from you 
 Keep living it to the fullest, treasure it, it's a blessing 
 Be thankful for all this beauty, when it's over with forget it 
 And you can tell everybody 
 This is your song 
 And you can tell everybody 
 This is your song 
 I hope you don't mind 
 I hope you don't mind 
 That I put down in words 
 How wonderful life like 
 Damn 
 What up, Phil? So good to hear from you, we missing you 
 Remembering all of our conversations, daily reminiscing you 
 The good the day they low, could tell they don't know who to listen to 
 Today I watch over Jeanette like she was my own and that could be difficult 
 I swear it's so unfair that I'm right here and you up there 
 I miss you so much now to the point I call your name but you not there 
 Now I can't rest and I can't do shit 
 Off my mind, I'm so upset 
 It wasn't your time to leave me yet 
 It broke my heart to see you dead 
 Shot with bullets that were meant for me, family's never forgiving me 
 I know, but all I could do was follow your memory 
 But pops I thank you so much for leaving, I had to grow up 
 Slinging crack on the corner ain't quite the future you wanted for me 
 Was it? And this pain I feel it never goes away 
 Does it? This load I carry get no lighter 
 I grew up all on my own with a broken heart and a broken home 
 Taught me everything I've known 
 Owe you everything I own 
 I must admit you raised a warrior, my life could be a story book 
 Hope you proud of me, didn't graduate from college but 
 Thanks for listening to me, 
 So long, I had it bottled up 
 Till we meet in person let's keep speaking through my verses for life 
 And you can tell everybody 
 This is your song 
 And you can tell everybody 
 This is your song 
 I hope you don't mind 
 I hope you don't mind 
 That I put down in words 
 How wonderful life like
