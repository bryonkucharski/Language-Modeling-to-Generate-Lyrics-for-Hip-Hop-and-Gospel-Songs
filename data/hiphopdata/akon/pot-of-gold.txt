Oh yeah, da da, do do, da da, do do, da da, do do, Akon 
 Life come and go 
 So let the history be too 
 We're all out here 
 Hustlin' to make our way 
 And while you're stumblin' and fallin' (stumblin' and fallin') 
 Why don't you pick yourself up now (pick yourself up now) 
 You see we all out here 
 Working day by day 
 So tell me 
 How can we work it out 
 On that day when it's time to share the gold at the end of the rainbow 
 How can we work it out 
 When good and evil be 
 The day you kiss this fate 
 'Cause it will soon come 
 You soon lose track of which way is up when you're always being put down (being put down) 
 You gotta be strong and do what you feel in your heart 
 Regardless of who's around (regardless of who's around) 
 I know it might seem bold 
 But that's all we have (all we have) 
 Many centuries and we're steady gettin' old 
 But you know to what we never had 
 So 
 How can we work it out 
 On that day when it's time to share the gold at the end of the rainbow 
 (How can we) how can we work it out (how can we) 
 When good and evil be 
 The day you kiss this fate 
 'Cause it will soon come 
 How can we work it out 
 On that day when it's time to share the gold at the end of the rainbow (share the gold) 
 How can we work it out 
 When good and evil be 
 The day you kiss this fate 
 'Cause it will soon come 
 How can we work it out (da da) 
 Do do (how can we work it out) 
 How can we work it out (da da) 
 Do do oh (da da) 
 How can we work it out (do do) 
 Da da how can we work it out (do do) 
 (Everybody sing along with me) 
 How can we work it out 
 On that day when it's time to share the gold at the end of the rainbow (that pot of gold) 
 How can we work it out 
 When good and evil be 
 The day you kiss this fate 
 'Cause it will soon come (yeah) 
 How can we work it out 
 On that day when it's time to share the gold at the end of the rainbow (that pot of gold) 
 How can we work it out 
 When good and evil be 
 The day you kiss this fate 
 'Cause it will soon come (soon come) 
 How can we work it out (work it out, work it out, work it out...)
