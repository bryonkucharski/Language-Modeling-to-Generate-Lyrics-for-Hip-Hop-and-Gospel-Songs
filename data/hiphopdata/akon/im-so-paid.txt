Rubbing' on that Italian leather 
 Dem' Konvict jeans on! 
 Ay yo Weezy! You Ready? 
 Yeah! 
 I get it in till the sunrise 
 Doin' 90 in a 65 
 Windows rolled down screaming "Ah!" 
 Hey-ey-ey... I'm so paid 
 Number one hustla gettin' money 
 Why do you wanna count my money? 
 I'ma hustla don't need them! One of y'all ya see! 
 I'm so paid 
 I see police on the crooked I 
 Doing a 100 on the Interstate 95 
 My shawty leanin' blasting that Do or Die 
 Pushin' that motherfuckin' wood 'cause we certified 
 Got a system that'll beat and knock your wall off 
 Got a pump under my seat, the sawed-off 
 Got a bunch of goons, hoping they never call off 
 I'm a sniper sitting on the roof already saw y'all 
 It ain't too much to put a strain on me 
 That's the reason why I had to put the blame on me 
 I rather have them dollar bills rain on me 
 Then let them haters come and make the name of me 
 That's why... 
 I get it in till the sunrise 
 Doin' 90 in a 65 
 Windows rolled down screaming "Ah!" 
 Hey-ey-ey... I'm so paid 
 Number one hustla gettin' money 
 Why do you wanna count my money? 
 I'ma hustla don't need them! One of y'all ya see! 
 I'm so paid 
 I am the boss it only takes one call 
 For a driver to hit you up and drop you off that's all 
 Guess what I won't be taking that fall 
 Homie I got cake that's what I'm paying them for (aha!) 
 Ain't that funny? 
 'Cause niggas want war but ain't got money 
 'Cause I've seen them all talking till they start gunnin' 
 Quicker than Usain Bolt the fastest thing running 
 Yeah! Akon! Weezy! 
 Block oil holdin' down Jersey 
 Devine making sure we gettin' it up front 
 My little brother Boo got that vision bake it! 
 I get it in till the sunrise 
 Doin' 90 in a 65 
 Windows rolled down screaming "Ah!" 
 Hey-ey-ey... I'm so paid 
 Number one hustla gettin' money 
 Why do you wanna count my money? 
 I'ma hustla don't need them! One of y'all ya see! 
 I'm so paid 
 (Lil Wayne - Verse 3) 
 Oh-oh, 
 Big money Weezy 
 White wife beater with the sig underneath it 
 How do I feel bitch I feel undefeated 
 Snap my fingers disappear from the precinct 
 Yeah! 
 I'm ballin' we ball out 
 Ball till we fall until the ball bounce 
 I send some niggas with guns to y'all house 
 Only to find out you live in a doll house 
 Damn! 
 But I thought you was tough though 
 We carry choppers on our necks 
 Call it cut throat 
 We, bury cowards on the set that they come from 
 We, know magic turn 
 Weed smoke to gun smoke 
 We, bomb first when we ride 
 You, in a hearse when you ride 
 Ay-yay 
 I put my shoe down baby, 
 And I'm holding down Young Mula baby! 
 That's why... 
 I get it in till the sunrise 
 Doin' 90 in a 65 
 Windows rolled down screaming "Ah!" 
 Hey-ey-ey... I'm so paid 
 Number one hustla gettin' money 
 Why do you wanna count my money? 
 I'ma hustla don't need them! One of y'all ya see! 
 I'm so paid
