(Feat. 50 Cent) 
 So much so much love 
 So much 
 So tell me can you feel it? 
 So much so much yeah 
 You know 
 Then make that visit 
 So much so much love 
 So much 
 Senegal can you feel it? 
 So much so much yeah 
 So much 
 So much love to share 
 Pure blackness, wantness is so rare 
 So much love to care 
 Let them know they're missin' out 
 Mama Africa 
 So much love to share 
 Sweet blackness, oneness 
 Meet me there 
 So much love to care 
 Let them know they missin' out 
 Sing again 
 This is for all the love 
 And the life took away 
 F 
 Don't forget we were bought and trade 
 R 
 Ripped from the land and shipped away 
 I 
 Is the inspiration we use to survive 
 C 
 Have to see it with your own cries 
 No play add it up and arrive 
 Still you don't know 
 The land is so gold and green 
 The place is so fresh and clean 
 And everyday I water my garden 
 Tell me if you feel it deep in your heart 
 Visit once, guaranteed to visit twice 
 And if you just believe in the most high 
 I know you'll be all right 
 That's my favorite place when I need to get away 
 F 
 Must forget but we can't forget to pray 
 R 
 Like Lance ridin' on the runway 
 I 
 In my homeland and I'm feelin' so alive 
 C 
 Imagine Africa unite 
 Gonna accept mass alright 
 Still you don't know 
 Skin is so dark and brown 
 She lifts me right off the ground 
 But no you not gonna see it on you TV 
 So just listen up and believe me 
 Her trees have the only cure 
 Her love is so new and pure 
 Had to kiss them troubles goodbye bye 
 No I don't have to lie 
 Mama Africa, unite 
 So much so much love 
 So tell me can you feel it 
 So much so much 
 Then make that visit 
 So much so much love 
 Senegal can you feel it 
 So much so much 
 Ow! 
 So much love to share 
 I just can't see how we're livin' without it 
 So much love to care 
 Don't miss don't miss one moment about it 
 So much love to share 
 Resist this bliss though I really doubt it 
 So much love so much love to share 
 Oh yeah 
 Is for ambition our dream we envision 
 F 
 Is for the fear we gon provoke when we vicious 
 R 
 Your smart enough to recognize my plan 
 A mystery become some history then change it damn 
 C, how we 
 Don't 4get how could we 4get Africa da motha land 
 Damn I thought you spanned 
 Had a piece beyond average for her I'm a savage 
 Property to lavish my life style is iight now
