See, I can kinda recall a lil' ways back 
 Small, tryin' to ball, always been black 
 And my hair, I tried it all I even went flat 
 Had a lumpy curly top and all that crap, now 
 Just tryin' to be appreciated 
 Nappy headed brothers never had no ladies 
 And I hit the barber shop real quick 
 Had 'em give me lil' twist and it drove 'em crazy (crazy) 
 Then I couldn't get no job 
 'Cause corporate wouldn't hire no dreadlocks 
 Then I thought about my dogs from the block 
 Kinda understand why they chose to steal and rob 
 Was it the hair that got me this far 
 All these girls these cribs these cars? 
 I hate to say it but it seem so flawed 
 'Cause success didn't come till I cut it all off 
 Little girl with the press and curl 
 Age eight, I got a Jheri curl 
 Thirteen, and I got a relaxer 
 I was a source of so much laughter 
 At fifteen when it all broke off 
 Eighteen and went all natural 
 February, 2002 
 I went on and did what I had to do 
 Because it was time to change my life 
 To become the woman that I am inside 
 Ninety-seven dreadlocks all gone 
 I looked in the mirror for the first time and saw that 
 Hey (hey) 
 I am not my hair 
 I am not this skin 
 I am not your expectations, no (hey) 
 I am not my hair 
 I am not this skin 
 I am the soul that lives within 
 Good hair means curls and waves (no) 
 Bad hair means you look like a slave (no) 
 At the turn of the century 
 It's time for us to redefine who we be 
 You can shave it off like a South African beauty 
 Or get in on lock like Bob Marley 
 You can rock it straight like Oprah Winfrey 
 If it's not what's on your head, it's what's underneath, and say 
 Hey (hey) 
 I am not my hair 
 I am not this skin 
 I am not your expectations, no (hey) 
 I am not my hair 
 I am not this skin 
 I am the soul that lives within 
 Who cares if you don't like that? 
 With nothin' to lose, postin' with the wave cap 
 And the cops wanna harass 'cause I got waves 
 Ain't see nothin' like that in all my days 
 Man, you gotta change all these feelings 
 Steady judging one another by their appearance 
 Yes, India, I feel ya, girl 
 Now go ahead, talk to the rest of the world 'cause 
 (Whoa, whoa, whoa) 
 Does the way I wear my hair make me a better person? 
 (Whoa, whoa, whoa) 
 Does the way I wear my hair make me a better friend? Oh 
 (Whoa, whoa, whoa) 
 Does the way I wear my hair determine my integrity? 
 (Whoa, whoa, whoa) 
 I am expressing my creativity 
 (Whoa, whoa, whoa) 
 Breast cancer and chemotherapy 
 Took away her crownin' glory 
 She promised God if she was to survive 
 She would enjoy every day of her life, oh 
 On national television 
 Her diamond eyes are sparkling 
 Bald-headed like a full moon shining 
 Singing out to the whole wide world like, hey 
 Hey (hey) 
 I am not my hair 
 I am not this skin 
 I am not your expectations, no (hey) 
 I am not my hair 
 I am not this skin 
 I am the soul that lives within 
 Hey (hey) 
 I am not my hair 
 I am not this skin 
 I am not your expectations, no (hey) 
 I am not my hair 
 I am not this skin 
 I am the soul that lives within
