(Akon) 
 Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin' 
 (Biggie) 
 I know how it feel to wake up fucked up 
 Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell 
 People look at you like youse the user 
 Selling drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser 
 But they don't know about your stress-filled day 
 Baby on the way mad bills to pay 
 That's why you drink Tanqueray; so you can reminisce 
 And wish, you wasn't livin' so devilish, ssshit 
 I remember I was just like you 
 Smokin' blunts with my crew, flippin over 62's 
 Cause G-E-D, wasn't B-I-G 
 I got P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me 
 She was forced to kick me out, no doubt 
 Then I figured out licks went for twenty down South 
 Packed up my tools for my raw power move 
 Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves 
 For chumps tryin' to stop my flow 
 And what they don't know will show on the autopsy 
 Went to see Papi, to cop me a brick 
 Asked for some consignment and he wasn't tryin' to hear it 
 Smoking mad Newport's 'cause I'm due in court 
 For an assault, that I caught, in Bridgeport, New York 
 Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man 
 You better have your gat in hand, cause man 
 (You betta have your gat in hand cause man)

 Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin' 
 (2pac) 
 Our lifestyles be close captioned 
 Addicted to fatal attractions 
 Pictures of actions be played back 
 In the midst of mashin' 
 No fairy tales for this young black male 
 Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales 
 Hustlin' and heart be a nigga culture or the 
 Repercutions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures 
 Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars and bitches 
 Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures 
 Why shed tears? Save your sympathy 
 My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetery 
 Here's a message to the newborns, waitin' to breathe 
 If you believe then you can achieve 
 Just look at me 
 Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on 
 Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on 
 To all the seeds that follow me 
 Protect your essence 
 Born with less, but you still precious 
 (Akon) 
 Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin' 
 Gun shots every night in the (ghetto) 
 Crooked cops on sight in the (ghetto) 
 Every day is a fight in the (ghetto) 
 (Oh oh oh oh oh) (ghetto) 
 Got kids to feed in the (ghetto) 
 Selling coke and weed in the (ghetto) 
 Every day somebody bleed in the (ghetto) 
 (Oh oh oh oh oh) (ghetto) 
 (Biggie) 
 I had the master plan 
 I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland 
 With my man Two-Tecs to take over this projects 
 They call him Two-Tecs, he tote two tecs 
 And when he start to bust he like to ask, Who's next? 
 At last, I'm literally loungin black 
 Sittin' back, countin' double digit thousand stacks 
 See who got smoked, what rumors was spread 
 Last I heard I was dead 
 (Akon) 
 Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin' 
 Cause that's the life when your 
 Living in the (ghetto) oh 
 Eating in the (ghetto) or 
 Sleeping in the (ghetto, ghetto) 
 That's the life when ur 
 Living in the (ghetto) oh 
 Eating in the (ghetto) or 
 Sleeping in the (ghetto, ghetto, ghetto) 
 (Biggie) 
 (Talking) It's a funny thing I kinda realized how powerful 2pac 
 And I was you know what I'm saying 'cause pac is a strong dude 
 Yo I know him we two individual people we waged a coastal 
 Beef but even tho we were going through our drama I would 
 Never wish death on nobody 'cause there ain't no comin' bac
