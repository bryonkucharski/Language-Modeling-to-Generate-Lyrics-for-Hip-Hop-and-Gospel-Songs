I can see it 
 It's funny man 
 'Cause it's like it's not going nowhere 
 And you gon' see it wherever there's struggle 
 (Once in a while I do look at you) 
 I see my pain in your eyes man 
 (To see that twinkle in your eyes) 
 So I know you're feelin' me 
 It's that twinkle man 
 That sign of struggle 
 I've seen it 
 In me 
 Cause everyday I can't help but see it 
 People ain't satisfied 
 And you're hatin' your 9 to 5 
 And Everybody wanna live another life 
 But ain't no length you go or mountain you climb 
 Not to better your days 
 All That would do is leave room for people to say 
 "I guess you're livin' better now 
 Share a little bit of that cheddar now" 
 'Cause I remember days back when 
 A brother was hustlin' and robbin' too 
 I done tossed the baretta now 
 On a whole nother level now 
 Still I can't enjoy my fame 
 Unless my people doin' the same 
 And gettin' money too 
 (Once in awhile I couldn't look at you) 
 Oh once in awhile 
 (And see the twinkle in your eyes) 
 And I can see that you don't ever wanna struggle no more 
 (Once in awhile I couldn't look at you) 
 Once in awhile 
 (And see the twinkle in your eyes) 
 And I can see that you don't ever wanna cry no more 
 Cause every time you ask me, I'm grindin' 
 It shouldn't have to be that way 
 You shouldn't have to pay my way 
 I shouldn't have to want for a brighter day 
 Got a little little problem on the way 
 Bounty hunters checkin' state to state 
 Child support lady on your case 
 Not to mention tickets you ain't never paid 
 Oh what must I do 
 That's what you'll be askin' 
 God please hold it down for me 
 Don't let Satan get the hold of me 
 I'm tryin' to tell you it can happen to me too 
 But it happened a lot worse to my brother 
 Muhammad thank God he recovered 
 (Once in awhile I choose look at you) 
 Once in awhile 
 (And see the twinkle in your eyes) 
 And I can see that you never wanna struggle no more 
 (Once in awhile I choose look at you) 
 Look in your eyes 
 (And see the twinkle in your eyes) 
 And I can see that you don't ever wanna cry no more 
 (Once in awhile I choose look at you) 
 'Cause I see your pain now 
 'Cause I see your pain now 
 I can feel you strain now 
 And I can see you cryin' 
 And inside you're dyin' 
 We're no longer the same now 
 But you got to make change now 
 (Once in awhile I do look at you) 
 Once in awhile 
 (And see the twinkle in your eyes) 
 And I can see that you don't ever struggle no more 
 (Once in awhile I do look at you) 
 Once in awhile 
 (And see the twinkle in your eyes) 
 And I can see that you don't ever wanna cry no more 
 Don't wanna cry no more 
 And I can see 
 That you don't ever want to struggle no more 
 And I can see that you don't ever wanna cry now more
