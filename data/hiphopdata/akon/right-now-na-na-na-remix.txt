 Kat DeLuna and Akon! 
 (Kat DeLuna) 
 Sleepless night 
 All that I could think about was us 
 And the way that only you know how to touch me 
 I try to move on 
 But I know I'm just fooling myself 
 Don't wanna be kissed, touched, loved 
 Or give my heart to someone else 
 I wanna make up ... na na na na 
 But before we make up ... na na na na 
 Promise me you'll never do it again 
 Tell me that we'll make it through to the end 
 I wanna make up ... nana na na na 
 But before we make up ... nana na na na 
 Promise me you'll never do it again 
 Tell me that we'll make it through to the end 
 (Akon) 
 Girl I know mistakes were made between us two 
 And we show our eyes that night even said somethings weren't true 
 Why'd you go and haven't seen my girl since then 
 Why can't it be the way it was 
 You are my homie lover and friend 
 (Kat DeLuna) 
 I wanna make up ... na na na na 
 But before we make up ... na na na na 
 Promise me you'll never do it again 
 Tell me that we'll make it through to the end 
 I wanna make up ... nana na na na 
 But before we make up ... nana na na na 
 Promise me you'll never do it again 
 Tell me that we'll make it through to the end 
 Don't lie (Don't lie) 
 Promise everyday you're gonna try (Try) 
 To make me feel like everything's all right (Make me feel all right) 
 Like I'm the apple of your eye (Of your eye) 
 I wanna make up ... na na na na 
 But before we make up ... na na na na 
 Promise me you'll never do it again 
 Tell me that we'll make it through to the end 
 I wanna make up ... nana na na na 
 But before we make up ... nana na na 
 Promise me you'll never do it again 
 Tell me that we'll make it through to the end 
 I wish I could fly with you 
 I wish I could lay with you (Lay with you) 
 I just wanna die with you (Die with you) 
 Get out my grind wïth you
