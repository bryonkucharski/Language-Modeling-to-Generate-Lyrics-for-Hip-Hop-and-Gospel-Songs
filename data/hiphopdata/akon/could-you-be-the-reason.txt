See I met her at club on the Friday 
 Big booty, small waist 
 Seeing her coming my way 
 So I had to bag her 
 I really had to have her (oh-ooh) 
 I didn't see a ring on her finger 
 I asked her have you ever been with a singer before 
 She said no (oh-oh) 
 So let me introduce you to my world 
 Big diamonds and pearls all of part of being my girl 
 (I got that paper) 
 Bet you ain't never seen before 
 Saw around the world 
 I got them coming back for more 
 And that's when I noticed 
 People are watching! 
 But we don't care 
 The way I am touching your body 
 'Cause we don't care 
 See you droppin' and poppin' 
 But we don't care 
 Makes me want to keep grinding 
 But we don't care (oh-ooh) 
 See I bet you're nasty 
 When you're on the dance floor 
 You got me going: Oh-Ooh! 
 Could you be the reason why I'm losing control 
 Fo Sho! Shawty we don't care! 
 Got shorty right where I want her 
 Strapped up, hands trapped in the corner 
 Grinding slow, and I won't let go (no-ooh) 
 Baby more better than ammonia 
 Feeling tipsy from the bottle of Corona (oh-no) 
 She probably let go (oh-ooh) 
 She said she wants to bring me to bring me to her world 
 She whispers some words 
 That damn near made my toes curl 
 She said she's got that 
 That I have never seen before 
 And if I get the taste 
 I'll be coming right back for more 
 And that's when I noticed 
 People are watching! 
 But we don't care 
 The way I am touching your body 
 'Cause we don't care 
 See you droppin' and poppin' 
 But we don't care 
 Makes me want to keep grinding 
 But we don't care (oh-ooh) 
 See I bet you're nasty 
 When you're on the dance floor 
 You got me going: Oh-Ooh! 
 Could you be the reason why I'm losing control 
 Fo Sho! Shawty we don't care! 
 I'm working your body 
 Like you are in my bedroom 
 Yeah... Yeah... Uh-uh... Yeah... Yeah 
 Everybody in the club got a clear view 
 But that won't stop us 
 'Cause we don't care! 
 People are watching! 
 We don't care 
 The way I am touching your body 
 'Cause we don't care 
 See you droppin' and poppin' 
 But we don't care 
 Makes me want to keep grinding 
 But we don't care (oh-ooh) 
 See I bet you're nasty 
 When you're on the dance floor 
 You got me going: Oh-Ooh! 
 Could you be the reason why I'm losing control 
 Fo Sho! Shawty we don't care!
