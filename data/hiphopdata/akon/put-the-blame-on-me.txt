Sorry, Blame It On Me lyrics 
 As life goes on I'm starting to learn more and more about responsibility 
 I realize everything I do is affecting the people around me 
 So I want to take this time out to apologize for things I have done 
 And things that have not occurred yet 
 And the things they don't want to take responsibility for 
 I'm sorry for the times I left you home 
 I was on the road and you were alone 
 I'm sorry for the times that I had to go 
 I'm sorry for the fact that I did not know 
 That you were sitting home just wishing we 
 Could go back to when it was just you and me 
 I'm sorry for the times I would neglect 
 I'm sorry for the times I disrespect 
 I'm sorry for the wrong things that I've done 
 I'm sorry I'm not always there for my son 
 I'm sorry for the fact that I'm not aware 
 That you can't sleep at night when I am not there 
 Because I am in the streets like everyday 
 Sorry for the things that I did not say 
 Like how you are the best thing in my world 
 And how I'm so proud to call you my girl 
 I understand that there are some problems 
 And I am not too blind to know 
 All the pain you kept inside you 
 Even though you might not show 
 If I can apologize for being wrong 
 Then it's just a shame on me 
 I'll be the reason for your pain and you can put the blame on me 
 You can put the blame on me [4x] 
 Said you can put the blame on me [3x] 
 You can put the blame on me 
 Sorry for the things that he put you through 
 And all the times you didn't know what to do 
 Sorry that you had to go and sell those packs 
 Just trying to stay busy till you heard from Dad 
 And you would rather be home with all your kids 
 As one big family with love and bliss 
 And even though Pops treated us like kings 
 He got a second wife and you didn't agree 
 He got up and left you there all alone 
 I'm sorry that you had to do it on your own 
 I'm sorry that I went and added to your grief 
 I'm sorry that your son was once a thief 
 I'm sorry that I grew up way too fast 
 I wish I would've listened and not be so bad 
 I'm sorry your life turned out this way 
 I'm sorry that the FEDS came and took me away 
 I'm sorry that it took so long to see 
 They were dead wrong trying to put it on me 
 I'm sorry that it took so long to speak 
 But I was on tour with Gwen Stefani 
 I'm sorry for the hand that she was dealt 
 For the embarrassment that she felt 
 Just a little young girl trying to have fun 
 Her daddy should never let her out that young 
 I'm sorry for Club Zen getting shut down 
 I hope they manage better next time around 
 How was I to know she was underage 
 In a 21 and older club they say 
 Why doesn't anybody wanna take blame 
 Verizon backed out disgracing my name 
 I'm just a singer trying to entertain 
 Because I love my fans I'll take that blame 
 Even though the blame's on you [3x] 
 I'll take that blame from you 
 And you can put that blame on me [2x] 
 You can put that blame on me 
 And you can put that blame on me
