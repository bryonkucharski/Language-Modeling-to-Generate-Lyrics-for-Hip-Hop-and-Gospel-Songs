(Akon) 
 I heard y'all n-ggas on that fly sh-t 
 Yeah that trap or die sh-t 
 Thrown on the block don't let it get too hot 
 And moving that "get you high sh-t" 
 Me I'm in that cockpit 
 On my suit and tie sh-t 
 Tryna cash it and ready or not tryna get up in them pockets 
 Fully packed up and holy 
 Best believe that it's loaded 
 Telling you now brother 
 Try that sh-t and your casket will be closed ay 
 A hundred stacks and we throw it 
 Ain't none of it stolen 
 And if you think you gon' take from us 
 Well we'll point at ya and blow it so... 
 Look out and drop down low now 
 Look out and drop down low now 
 Look out and drop down low now 
 Look out and drop down low now 
 Look out and drop down low now 
 Look out and drop down low now 
 Look out and drop down low now 
 Look out and drop down low now 
 Don't bother nobody 
 Unless they bring a fight to my party 
 Well then hey 
 That means they're asking for it 
 They're asking for it 
 Like I'm asking her to break it on down (look out, look out) 
 Break it on down (look out, look out) 
 Break it on down (look out, look out) 
 Break it on down (look out, look out) 
 (Ludacris) 
 Ha look out guess who it is 
 That n-gga from Atlanta 
 Where the best do it is 
 So get your money together and bet who it is 
 'Cause when it comes to spitting lyrics I'm the best in the business 
 Go by the name of Luda 
 The industry intruder 
 Collipark Park G.A. 
 Where the hustlas stay and the criminals rob us, shoot us 
 On the corner with the keys in hand 
 We'll leave you where you stand 
 We'll lift you off your feet and make you fly like Peter Pan 
 Don't make no sudden moves 
 Or I'll squeeze my southern tools 
 While I'm with my southern b-tch 
 26 inches no southern shoes 
 I ride out slide out 
 Groupies cry they eyes out 
 'Cause I'm making the kind of paper that dope boys get when they bring them pies out 
 Wasn't born with a silver spoon 
 So recognise when you hear that tune 
 You better drop down low when you hear that 
 When you hear that 
 Hear that boom 
 (Akon - Verse 3) 
 I know that you like it 
 Your body's what I'm enticed with 
 Move around like you work it girl 
 But that ain't you in the slightest 
 Love the way that she hide it 
 Says she want me inside it 
 Baby girl got the Superwoman 
 And I'm a kryptonite it 
 She feeling so weak 
 Made her drop to her knees 
 Got a taste of this? 
 Taller than all of your trees 
 She'll pin me down to my seat 
 And rolling hips to the beat 
 I had to come and take full control 
 And show her how it's gon' be 
 And told her
