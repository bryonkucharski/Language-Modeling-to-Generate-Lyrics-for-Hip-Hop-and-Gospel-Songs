All steady up in the club, just swagging doing my thang 
 Popping bottles with models and just watching them drank 
 Partying so hard, the ladies don't want it to end 
 They looked at me and said, I heard that you're a heartbreaker 
 Baby I'm a troublemaker, I heard that you're a heartbreaker 
 Baby I'm a troublemaker, I heard that you're a heartbreaker 
 Baby I'm a troublemaker, I heard that you're a heartbreaker 
 Baby I'm a troublemaker 
 See I'm that type of guy you won't love 
 I'm that type of guy you won't cuff 
 I'm that type of guy you daddy won't let go out 
 'Cause he thinks I sell drugs 
 I'm that type of guy that will save ya 
 I'm that type that will call you later 
 Won't be around to give you that time 
 Gotta get on the grind and get to that paper that I can do 
 Gotta keep my baby girl laced up in the latest and the fliest suits 
 Never want for nothing, let's get caked up 
 Hold it down, that's all you gotta do 
 Then I walk up in the place with a pocket full of money 
 My brother like I are the dude 
 Stepping out with the finest suits, look at me now 
 All steady up in the club, just swagging doing my thang 
 Popping bottles with models and just watching them drank 
 Partying so hard, the ladies don't want it to end 
 They looked at me and said, I heard that you're a heartbreaker 
 Baby I'm a troublemaker, I heard that you're a heartbreaker 
 Baby I'm a troublemaker, I heard that you're a heartbreaker 
 Baby I'm a troublemaker, I heard that you're a heartbreaker 
 Baby I'm a troublemaker 
 See I'm that type of guy that likes kissing 
 I'm that type that will pop the clip and 
 I'm that type of guy that put you in your place 
 If you bougie just start tripping 
 I'm that type that will let you go 
 I'm that type that will let you know 
 That everywhere I go, I can find a pretty *** 
 But there ain't too many know how to get that dough 
 That's the type of girl I want around me 
 Even though I'm a with her, make a man feel free 
 Roll with the fellas, even hold my cheese 
 Look like something you would see on TV 
 She don't mind climbing up that ladder 
 Similar to the words, it don't matter 
 But this time they wanna see us together 
 Look at us now 
 All steady up in the club, just swagging doing my thang 
 Popping bottles with models and just watching them drank 
 Partying so hard, the ladies don't want it to end 
 They looked at me and said, I heard that you're a heartbreaker 
 Baby I'm a troublemaker, I heard that you're a heartbreaker 
 Baby I'm a troublemaker, I heard that you're a heartbreaker 
 Baby I'm a troublemaker, I heard that you're a heartbreaker 
 Baby I'm a troublemaker 
 You're not for sure 
 Even though I wanna take you everywhere I go 
 Because of you, all the girls is staring, taking notes 
 And I realize being with you girls brings more girls 
 And that's just what I'm attracted to 
 And I'd rather go all the way 
 Love her long time till the break of day 
 I won't let her leave my bed 
 Till she sees the Color Purple like Annie Mae 
 Now she wants to start holding on me 
 Like whatever she's smoking on 
 I'll be long gone before you can say 
 Look at me now 
 All steady up in the club, just swagging doing my thang 
 Popping bottles with models and just watching them drank 
 Partying so hard, the ladies don't want it to end 
 They looked at me and said, I heard that you're a heartbreaker 
 Baby I'm a troublemaker, I heard that you're a heartbreaker 
 Baby I'm a troublemaker, I heard that you're a heartbreaker 
 Baby I'm a troublemaker, I heard that you're a heartbreaker 
 Baby I'm a troublemaker
