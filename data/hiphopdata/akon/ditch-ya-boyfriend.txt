 Hey, hey... 
 You can visit any city 
 Sail through the pacific 
 I guarantee that you'll never find a G? like me 
 You can ask any killer 
 Cold-hearted gorilla 
 And they'll break it down for you like k? 
 I see you with your nigga 
 Pretty you looking better 
 And I can tell that you'd rather be with me 
 Stop acting like a punk and go do what you wanna do 
 Get over here and tell that nigga I ain't scared of you 
 Now ditch ya boyfriend and come get it 
 If he got a problem tell him he can deal with it 
 I said ditch ya boyfriend and come get it 
 If he got a problem tell him he come and deal with it
