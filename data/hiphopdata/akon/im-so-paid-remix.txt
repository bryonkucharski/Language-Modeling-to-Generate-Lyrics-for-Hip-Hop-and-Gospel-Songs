Rubbin' on that Italian leather 
 Konvict Jeans on 
 Ay yo Weezy, you ready? 
 Yeah! 
 I get it in 'til the sun rise 
 Goin' 90 in a 65 
 Windows rolled down screamin' "Ah!" 
 Hey-ey-ey, I'm so paid 
 Number one hustler gettin' money 
 Why you wanna count my money? 
 I'm a hustler and don't need them 
 One of y'all, you see, I'm so paid 
 I see police on that crooked, I 
 Doin' 100 on Interstate 95 
 My shorty leanin', blastin' that 'Do Or Die' 
 Wishin' that a motherfucker would, 'cause we certified 
 Got a system that'll beat and knock your wall off 
 Got a pump under my seat, sawed-off 
 Got a bunch of goons, hope they never call off 
 I'm a sniper sittin' on the roof, already saw y'all 
 Ain't too much to put a strain on me 
 That's the reason why I had to put the blame on me 
 I'd rather have them dollar bills rain on me 
 Than to let them haters come and make a name off me 
 That's why I get it in 'til the sun rise 
 Doin' 90 in a 65 
 Windows rolled down screamin' "Ah!" 
 Hey-ey-ey, I'm so paid 
 Number one hustler gettin' money 
 Why you wanna count my money? 
 I'm a hustler and don't need them 
 One of y'all, you see, I'm so paid 
 I'm the boss, it only takes one call 
 For a driver to hit you up and drop you off and that's all 
 Guess what? I won't be takin' that fall 
 Homie, I got cake, that's what I'm payin' them for 
 Ha ha, ain't that funny? 
 'Cause niggas they want war but ain't got money 
 'Cause I've seen 'em all talk until they start gunnin' 
 Quicker than Usain Bolt, the fastest thing runnin' 
 Yeah, Akon! Weezy! 
 Block oil holdin' down Jersey 
 Devine makin' sure we gettin' it up front 
 My little brother Boo got that vision, baby 
 I get it in 'til the sun rise 
 Doin' 90 in a 65 
 Windows rolled down screamin' "Ah!" 
 Hey-ey-ey, I'm so paid 
 Number one hustler gettin' money 
 Why you wanna count my money? 
 I'm a hustler and don't need them 
 One of y'all, you see, I'm so paid 
 Ah-oh, big money Weezy 
 White wife-beater with the sig underneath it 
 How do I feel? Bitch, I feel undefeated 
 Snap my fingers, disappear from the precinct, yeah 
 I'm ballin', we ball out 
 Thoughts of we fallin' until the ball bounce 
 I send some niggas with guns at y'all house 
 Only to find out you live in a doll house 
 Damn! But I thought you was tough though 
 We carry choppers on our necks, call it cut throat 
 We bury powers on the set that they come from 
 We know magic turn weed smoke to gun smoke 
 We ball first when we ride 
 You in a Hearse when you ride 
 I put my shoe down baby 
 And I'm holdin' down Young Mula baby 
 That's why I get it in 'til the sun rise 
 Doin' 90 in a 65 
 Windows rolled down screamin' "Ah!" 
 Hey-ey-ey, I'm so paid 
 Number one hustler gettin' money 
 Why you wanna count my money? 
 I'm a hustler and don't need them
