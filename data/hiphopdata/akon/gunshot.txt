 Had to make good with crooked ass cops 
 Witness innocent by-standers get shot 
 Made a living ready or not (We)

 Things getting hard but we still grinding up 
 (To stay true!) To all my niggas 
 Still don't came up and cops cribs by the river 
 Men we imported export keys 
 Before the feds came down on we 
 True bad man no counterfeit g's 
 Maybe wanna stick around and trust you will see (That)
