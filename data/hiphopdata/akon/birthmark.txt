Yeeaaa yeaaaa, yeeaaa yeaaaa 
 Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh 
 Yeeaaa yeaaaa, yeeaaa yeaaaa 
 Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh 
 Yeah 
 I made the mark on February 1st 
 Between me and you you can call it birth 
 The beginning of our universe 
 Remind me of alicia keys verse 
 I'm faling for you 
 I wish I had an opportunity to not do, what I did to hurt you, now I'm here living with regrets 
 I know that it was my fault 
 I know that I got caught 
 So please don't lose your thoughts 
 Of me loving you and you loving me 
 I'm on the highway swerving 
 I ain't drunk but I'm about to hit the curb'n 
 Looking at the calendar getting nervous 
 Just a few more days to the first soul 
 This the day it all began 
 One place that it came together 
 More than a ring or a tattoo 
 Wish your birthmark that reminds me of you 
 So let's get on an airplane 
 Go back to where we began 
 To that point which is days apart 
 That stamp right next to your heart 
 (To your heart, to your heart, to your heart) 
 To your heart 
 (To your heart, to your heart, to your heart) 
 To your heart 
 (To your heart, to your heart, to your heart) 
 To your heart 
 (To your heart, to your heart, to your heart) 
 Get the calendar 
 Go to august 3rd 
 First words stay we heard, our first words 
 First argument, gotta let it go 
 'Cause it could possibly affect what our future holds 
 Flipping pages, Now I'm famous 
 Thinking back I ain't seen you in ages 
 Wishing that I coulda made it less painless 
 Brings me back right back to the same mess 
 I know that it was my fault 
 I know that I got caught 
 So please don't lose your thoughts 
 Of me loving you and you loving me 
 I'm on the highway swerving 
 I ain't drunk but I'm about to hit the curb'n 
 Looking at the calendar getting nervous 
 Just a few more days to the first soul 
 This the day it all began 
 One place that it came together 
 More than a ring or a tattoo 
 Wish your birthmark that reminds me of you 
 So let's get on an airplane 
 Go back to where we began 
 To that point which is days apart 
 That stamp right next to your heart 
 (To your heart, to your heart, to your heart) 
 To your heart 
 (To your heart, to your heart, to your heart) 
 To your heart 
 (To your heart, to your heart, to your heart) 
 To your heart 
 (To your heart, to your heart, to your heart) 
 January February March April May 
 June July august is just another day 
 September October November trying to find a way, 
 In December to mark my calendar to meet again 
 If only we can go to that place where me and you know 
 There's no faith fronting cheating even lying 
 The time has come where we stand face to face 
 This the day it all began 
 One place that it came together 
 More than a ring or a tattoo 
 Wish your birthmark that reminds me of you 
 So let's get on an airplane 
 Go back to where we began 
 To that point which is days apart 
 That stamp right next to your heart 
 To your heart 
 To your heart 
 To your heart 
 That stamp right next to your heart 
 (To your heart, to your heart, to your heart) 
 To your heart 
 (To your heart, to your heart, to your heart) 
 To your heart 
 (To your heart, to your heart, to your heart) 
 To your heart 
 (To your heart, to your heart, to your heart) 
 That stamp right next to your heart
