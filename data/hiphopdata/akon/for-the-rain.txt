 Ah 
 Konvict music 
 Yeah 
 The pressure's buildin' up 
 I feel like givin' up 
 How in the fuck am I gonna back my first album up 
 Well everything has changed 
 It'll never be the same 
 Nobody know me 
 Then everybody knows my name 
 And I feel so ashamed 
 I never been the kinda nigga that would complain 
 But it's so crazy man 
 It's no different 
 Everyday it's just the same thing 
 Now it's been months out on the road 
 On tour doin' so many different shows 
 Head spinnin' feelin' like it's gonna explode 
 And I just wanna know 
 If anybody out there's feelin' me 
 I'm losin' my mind 
 And I can't believe 
 I let this shit get the best of me 
 And now I gotta let ya know 
 One's got me insane 
 'Cause I can't stand the rain 
 It's hitting my window pane 
 A little too much 
 And now I gotta let ya know 
 One's got my face in a frown 
 Aye 
 'Cause I can't stand the sound 
 Of the thunder that's crashing down 
 Upon my house 
 Now I gotta let ya know 
 Now I got no more worries now 
 My pocket's fatter now 
 Look in the mirrow my reflection looks different now 
 You're gettin' bigger 
 Akon you need to settle down 
 Why do I feel this way 
 Should I be happy 
 Should I just ignore 
 Everything I've been given 
 Please help me lord 
 It's all over 
 But I can't escape the rain 
 Now it's been months out on the road 
 On tour doin' so many different shows 
 Head spinnin' feelin' like it's gonna explode 
 And I just wanna know 
 If anybody out there's feelin' me 
 I'm losin' my mind 
 And I can't believe 
 I let this shit get the best of me 
 And now I gotta let ya know 
 One's got me insane 
 'Cause I can't stand the rain 
 It's hitting my window pane 
 A little too much 
 And now I gotta let ya know 
 One's got my face in a frown 
 Aye 
 'Cause I can't stand the sound 
 Of the thunder that's crashing down 
 Upon my house 
 Now I gotta let ya know 
 Singin' woe diddy woe diddy woe
