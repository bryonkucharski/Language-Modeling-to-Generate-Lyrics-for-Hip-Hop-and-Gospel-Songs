You're an alcoholic 
 You're an alcoholic red nose reindeer like Rudolph 
 I'm here to tear the roof off 
 And if you want to take it to the guns, I'ma shoot off 
 Your head before you reach for the pistol 
 And when the bartender turns around I'ma reach for the Cristal 
 You not ready for this style, I'm straight Psycho wit it 
 And I bet you in love with, yeah Psycho hit it 
 A long time ago, I'ma keep doing my thizzle 
 Till it's time to go, but for now it's time to blow 
 Good as me in the club popping bubbly 
 I can't complain life is lovely 
 Either you hate me or you love me 
 Fans wanna know when the Nuts is gonna come next 
 It doesn't matter competition is no contest 
 I don't mean to brag, I'm just being honest 
 Where my dogs at smoking up at the college? 
 Clap your hands to the beat and get your bounce on 
 Put your drinks up, if your blazing get you ounce on 
 Girl I'd house you, but this ain't no house song 
 And no kissing, I dunno what you had your mouth on 
 Find us in the back of the club 
 Squad deep and we all got snuff 
 Hold the fort down, we ain't gonna budge 
 Bother nobody less you fucking with us 
 You can bring it to us however you want 
 Shake your, booty, booty I'm ready to fuck 
 Especially the shorty with that big butt 
 Shake your booty, booty, I'm ready to fuck 
 Look, don't approach me in a physical manner 
 'Cause the cannon I'm holding ain't a digital camera 
 And I don't care less about women and glamor 
 Or which one of you rappers is lifting his hammer 
 I'ma get loose like a pair of pajamas 
 I speak through those switches, spit like Obama 
 Trying to get rich without guns and the scanner 
 That's A to the K with a fucking bandanna 
 Seize your empire, believe in no lies 
 Squeeze the deserties like Jesus inside her 
 Spit like the shit on my teeth is barbwire 
 Make your girl suck cock till her knees are on fire 
 That's it though, no more games 
 This one right here is gonna blow your brains 
 If you in the club you better hold your chain 
 'Cause I'm bugging and I just might stomp your frame 
 Find us in the back of the club 
 Squad deep and we all got snuff 
 Hold the fort down, we ain't gonna budge 
 Bother nobody less you fucking with us 
 You can bring it to us however you want 
 Shake your booty, booty, I'm ready to fuck 
 Especially the shorty with that big butt 
 Shake your booty, booty, I'm ready to fuck 
 Find us in the back of the club 
 Squad deep and we all got snuffs 
 Hold the fort down, we ain't gonna budge 
 Bother nobody less you fucking with us 
 You can bring it to us however you want 
 Shake your booty, booty, I'm ready to fuck 
 Especially the shorty with that big butt 
 Shake your booty, booty, I'm ready to fuck
