 While you bend over

 Shawty you're so damn sexual So damn incredible 
 And that ain't helping at all 
 You know I got it shawty 
 But that ain't stopping you from being naughty 
 It's like you want me to climb in and fall 
 Find myself up outta you 
 What am I supposed to do 
 When you're... that at me like a big ball 
 What really... tossin you 
 But I gotta think about me too 
 But you have to spread yourself on the wall 
 While you bend over 
 While you bend over 
 While you bend over 
 While you bend over 
 While you bend over 
 While you bend over 
 While you bend over 
 While you bend over
