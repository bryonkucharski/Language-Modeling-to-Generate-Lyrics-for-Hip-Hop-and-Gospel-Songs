Ooh *I don't have no one* *me, myself and I*, listen 
 Allow me to take the blame 
 Everything I did, I did it all by myself, it was just *me, myself and I* 
 Listen, Couldn't believe the things I went through, because of all my wrong doings it was *me, myself and I* 
 Ooh listen, tryin' not to worry about a thing, but it's hard when I put it all on myself it was *me, myself and I* 
 Ooh listen, all the trouble I got myself in, it was up to me, couldn't depend on no one but *me, myself and I* yeah... 
 'Cause often times I feel like I'm all alone in this world and *I don't have no one* but me *me, myself and I* 'Cause often times I feel like I'm all alone in this world and *I don't have no one* but me *me, myself and I* 
 Ooh listen, see I done left those streets alone, half my niggas long, long gone and it's just me *me, myself and I* 
 Listen, Ain't got nobody to turn to 
 Can't complain 'cause nobody can burn you, why must it be *me, myself and I* 
 Ooh listen, even though it felt good to be alone 
 It didn't feel good to walk in my home it just *me, myself and I* 
 Ooh listen, Can't believe I'm on top of the world 
 But to me nothing feels the same no more, and I blame me *me, myself and I* 
 'Cause often times I feel like I'm all alone in this world and *I don't have no one* but me *me, myself and I* 'Cause often times I feel like I'm all alone in this world and *I don't have no one* but me *me, myself and I* 
 So can you please tell me where my people at 
 It was from way back when I started with 
 I'm still tryin' to figure out where they went, and why it is *me, myself and I* 
 'Cause the world keepin' busy girl', as I go, put your right go and feel alone 
 It should be the other way around you know, but it's just *me, myself and I* 
 *Me, myself and I* 
 I, *me, myself and I* *me, myself and I* 
 *Me, myself and I* 
 I, *me, myself and I* *me, myself and I* 
 'Cause often times I feel like I'm all alone in this world and *I don't have no one* but me *me, myself and I* 'Cause often times I feel like I'm all alone in this world and *I don't have no one* but me *me, myself and I* 
 *Listen*
