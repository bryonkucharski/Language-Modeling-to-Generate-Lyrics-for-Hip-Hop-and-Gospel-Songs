Nobody wanna see us together 
 But it don't matter no 
 'Cause I got you babe 
 Nobody wanna see us together 
 But it don't matter no 
 'Cause I got you babe 
 'Cause we gon? fight 
 Oh yes we gon? fight 
 Believe we gon? fight 
 We gon? fight 
 Fight for our right to love yeah 
 Nobody wanna see us together 
 But it don't matter no 
 'Cause I got you 
 Nobody wanna see us together 
 Nobody thought we'd last forever 
 I feel I'm hopin' and prayin'? 
 Things between us don't get better 
 Men steady comin' after you 
 Women steady comin' after me 
 Seem like everybody wanna go for self 
 And don't wanna respect boundaries 
 Tellin' you all those lies 
 Just to get on your side 
 But I must admit there was a couple secrets 
 I held inside 
 But just know that I tried 
 To always apologize 
 And I?ma have you first always in my heart 
 To keep you satisfied 
 Nobody wanna see us together 
 But it don't matter no 
 'Cause I got you babe 
 Nobody wanna see us together 
 But it don't matter no 
 'Cause I got you babe 
 'Cause we gon? fight 
 Oh yes we gon? fight 
 Believe we gon? fight 
 We gon? fight 
 Fight for our right to love yeah 
 Nobody wanna see us together 
 But it don't matter no 
 'Cause I got you 
 Got every right to wanna leave 
 Got every right to wanna go 
 Got every right to hit the road 
 And never talk to me no more 
 You don't even have to call 
 Even check for me at all 
 Because the way I been actin' lately 
 Has been off the wall 
 Especially toward you 
 Puttin' girls before you 
 And they watchin' everything I been doin'? 
 Just to hurt you 
 Most of it just ain't you 
 Ain't true 
 And they won't show you 
 How much of a queen you are to me 
 And why I love you baby 
 Nobody wanna see us together 
 But it don't matter no 
 'Cause I got you babe 
 Nobody wanna see us together 
 But it don't matter no 
 'Cause I got you babe 
 'Cause we gon? fight 
 Oh yes we gon? fight 
 Believe we gon? fight 
 We gon? fight 
 Fight for our right to love yeah 
 Nobody wanna see us together 
 But it don't matter no 
 'Cause I got you 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 'Cause I got you 
 'Cause I got you 
 Ooh

 'Cause I got you 
 Nobody wanna see us together 
 But it don't matter no
