I'm ridin' full speed, leavin' from the ghetto doin' 
 A hundred miles an hour, you can barely see me movin' 
 Gotta shorty waitin' for me that I been pursuin' 
 And I ain't got far to go 
 She a bad chick, somethin' I ain't tryna ruin 
 She's steady callin', so I know she ready to get to it 
 I'm tryna get there but I just can't 
 Seem to catch up to her 
 By the time I got there she was gone 
 And so I walked upstairs and I heard this sound 
 So pretty, so gritty, so funny that no one's around 
 So I locked myself inside and closed the door 
 But there was this funny feeling inside 
 That I couldn't get rid of, then I sing it 
 Miss Melody, who could she be? Describin' me 
 All alone with my ears pressed against the wall 
 Miss Melody, who could she be? Describin' me 
 Alone with my ears pressed against the wall 
 Standin' in front of my window pane 
 The sound got me starin' at the rain 
 The more she play the more I feel the pain 
 Why is she doing this, what's it to gain? 
 Seems like she tryna take my soul away 
 Startin' to feel I'm under her control today 
 I can't see her but I hear her from the shades 
 And it seems like she really knows me 
 Every fiddle makes me wanna run away 
 I can't take it no more, gotta get away 
 Got me talkin' about the dark nights 
 In the cage while she starin' at me 
 Miss Melody, who could she be? Describin' me 
 All alone with my ears pressed against the wall 
 Miss melody, who could she be? Describin' me 
 Alone with my ears pressed against the wall
