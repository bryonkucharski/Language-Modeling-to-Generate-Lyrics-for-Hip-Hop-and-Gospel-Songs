Everything I have, everything I own 
 All my mistakes man you already know 
 I wanna be free, I wanna be free (Konvict) 
 From Senegal West Africa, 
 To St. Louis, Missouri 
 Thanks to Catherine Dana 
 For giving my pops his glory 
 He came down with his drum 
 And a dream to change the world 
 In a free uplifting world 
 And that's all he ever want 
 Mom came a little after 
 Gave birth to my brother 
 Then all of the pressure 
 Made em' fight one another 
 See, the pain would never last 
 Did the best with what they had 
 He knew the world was out for grabs 
 And he searched to find his 
 Freedom, Freedom, Freedom, (Oh) Freedom 
 Everything I have, everything I own 
 All my mistakes man, you already know

 So I search to find my (find my).. 
 ...Freedom, Freedom, Freedom, Freedom 
 Everything I have, everything I own 
 All my mistakes girl, you already know 
 I wanna be free, I wanna be free, yeah 
 As a kid I never knew 
 I'd have to hustle just to make it through 
 So I found myself skipping school 
 Cause' the girls don't think I'm cool 
 And because of that I didn't care 
 Whether or not I went to jail 
 I just wanna be treated fair 
 Cause that's all I ever knew 
 Tellin' me I need to slow down 
 Cause everybody in the whole town 
 'Cause they know how I get down 
 Foreigner from another town 
 Can you believe we still around? 
 After so many hit the ground 
 And we ain't gon stop now 
 Until we get that 
 Freedom,(ooh) Freedom,(ooh) Freedom, (oh) Freedom 
 Everything I have,(have) everything I own, (own) 
 All my mistakes man you already know (yeah) 
 I wanna be free, (free) I wanna be free (free) 
 Won't stop till I find 
 My freedom, my Freedom,(Freedom) my Freedom, (Freedom) (oh) Freedom 
 Everything I have, everything I own 
 All my mistakes girl, you already know 
 I wanna be free, I wanna be free, yeah

 Put your hands up, (ay) put your hands up (ay) 
 If you wanna be free, from all your misery
