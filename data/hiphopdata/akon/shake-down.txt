(Cell door slams) 
 Konvict 
 Stand up 
 Salute 
 Devon Stephens 
 Up front is in the building 
 It's the convict album 
 Yeah 
 Y'all done fucked up now 
 I got money now nigga 
 I got enough money to free Amistad 
 He ain't lyin' 
 If you sellin we ain't buyin 
 If you got it on ya block 
 You best believe we supplyin' 
 From a key to a half a pound 
 A quarter to a dime 
 Tryin' to own a piece of Brooklyn 
 Like my niggas John Klein 
 Hey 
 Ya know me I'm known to rock wit it 
 Roll through your spot wit it 
 Post up block wit it 
 Hey ya know me I'm on the block with it 
 Non-stop wit it 
 Violate and get popped wit it 
 Hey 
 So I suggest ya keep steppin on me 
 Cause you will rarely find me 
 Without my weapon on me 
 Got the whole konvict squad bettin on me 
 And now the dots around the world 
 Are now connectin' on me 
 Hey now 
 A bunch of gangstas strapped 
 So make 'em wait now 
 When they come wavin' them gats 
 Ya know to lay down 
 And give 'em all ya got 
 'Cause it's a shake down

 Oh oh oh hey hey hey 
 A fleet of European cars in my driveway 
 Murciélago, Gallardo, Ferrari 
 My shortie ridin' shotgun 
 Bumpin sadie 
 Toes hangin' out the window 
 Loadin' up my army 
 You know I keep a bad bitch breathin' on me 
 Also known to have no business with no beefin on me 
 And won't hesitate to cock it 
 When them people on me 
 So guess what? 
 No exceptions to ya neither homie 
 Ya know I got that African connection 
 Locked up in a facility correction 
 Amistad-style changed 
 Hangin' like blouw 
 Black Royals, Upfront 
 We in the place now

 He'll show ya how to shake this down 
 First nigga to create this sound 
 Can't believe it took a konvict to shake this town 
 Dippin' European linen with the v-net 
 Diamond studded vvs 
 No less 
 Kunta Kinte bracelet 
 Lit up the whole set 
 My nigga we on deck 
 Best believe it's no sweat 
 Need street credibility, who you gon' get? 
 I give you that credibility for the right check 
 Keep your future on the shelf 
 Quiet where it's best kept 
 Don't want them upfront shooters 
 Bringin' red light 
 Hey now 
 A bunch of gangstas strapped 
 So make a wish now 
 When they come wavin' them gats 
 Ya know to lay down 
 And give 'em all ya got 
 'Cause it's a shake down
