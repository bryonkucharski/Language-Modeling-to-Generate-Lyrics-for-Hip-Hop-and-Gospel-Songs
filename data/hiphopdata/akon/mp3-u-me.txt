I won't take off your MP3 address 
 Until you tell me yes 
 That you received my text 
 Now you've got the sex 
 I wanna MP3 with you 
 I'm on your laptop 
 Goin' to download, baby 
 I wanna MP3 with you 
 Straight from my hard drive into your software 
 Gotta let you know I care 
 I wanna MP3 with you 
 I want ?.. computer software 
 Gotta let you know I can't 
 I wanna MP3 with you 
 This is the end of edition and ladies! 
 I wanna MP3 you need (o oh!) ... need (o oh!) need (o oh!) 
 I wanna MP3 you need (o oh!) ... need (o oh!) need (o oh!) 
 I wanna MP3 you need 
 Look at your body like me bu you say nobody 
 Always ... on PC, 'cause she's whole (?) body 
 Girl step into my chat room 
 Every time you think of me 
 And I'll get right back to you 
 So expeditiously 
 Pushin' on your keys 
 Touchin' on your mouse 
 Imagine you and me 
 Runnin' through your house 
 I'll givin' you the business 
 As we try to make some children 
 I wanna MP3 with you 
 I'm on your laptop 
 Goin' to download, baby 
 I wanna MP3 with you 
 Straight from my hard drive into your software 
 Gotta let you know I care 
 I wanna MP3 with you 
 I want ?.. computer software 
 Gotta let you know I can't 
 I wanna MP3 with you 
 This is the end of edition and ladies! 
 I wanna MP3 you need ... need (o oh!) need (o oh!) need (o oh!) 
 I wanna MP3 you need ... need (o oh!) need (o oh!) need (o oh!) 
 I wanna MP3 you need
