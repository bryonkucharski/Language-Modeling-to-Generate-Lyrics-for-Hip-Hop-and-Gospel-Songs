If I could escape I would but, first of all, let me say 
 I must apologize for acting stank and treating you this way 
 'Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor 
 It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator 
 Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold' 
 If I could escape and recreate a place that's my own world 
 And I could be your favorite girl forever, perfectly together 
 Tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet' 
 (The sweet escape) 
 If I could be sweet 
 (Sorry boy) 
 I know I've been a real bad girl 
 (I'll try to change) 
 I didn't mean for you to get hurt whatsoever 
 We can make it better 
 Tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet' 
 (Sweet escape, sweet escape) 
 I want to get away to our sweet escape 
 I want to get away, yeah 
 You held me down, I'm at my lowest boiling point 
 Come help me out, I need to get me out of this joint 
 Come on let's bounce, counting on you to turn me around 
 Instead of clowning around, let's look for some common ground 
 So baby, times get a little crazy 
 I've been getting a little lazy waiting on you to come save me 
 I can see that your angry by the way that you treat me 
 Hopefully you don't leave me, wanna take you with me 
 If I could escape and recreate a place that's my own world 
 And I could be your favorite girl forever, perfectly together 
 And tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet' 
 (The sweet escape) 
 If I could be sweet 
 (Sorry boy)

 (Sweet escape, sweet escape) 
 If I could escape, if I could escape
