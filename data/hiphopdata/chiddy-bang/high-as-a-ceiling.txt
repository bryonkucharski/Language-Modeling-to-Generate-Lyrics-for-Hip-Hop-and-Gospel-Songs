Yeah, yeah 
 Summer mornings we be smokin' in the sunshine 
 Done trying shit, we got it done one time 
 'Cause if they pull us over, then they'll smell the scent 
 And I'm straight but the kush got me hella bent 
 This type of practice is most effective when under tents 
 Around the atlas they do it and I am so convinced 
 And you could never find it cheaper than what they have charged 
 Got the medical on deck, I play my cards 
 Yeah and I met her in the tenth grade 
 And when I hit her, she take me back to the old days 
 Yeah coming up we was the opposite of so paid 
 Wanted the Jordans we blunted we had no J's 
 And I got us all so you should know we all we got 
 Started from Starbucks now we at the coffee shop 
 And this reflecting is the feeling I'm accepting 
 So the money I'm investing, hope the boys aren't arresting 
 Sitting back as the days go 
 You know we make pay roll 
 Yeah we get high as the ceiling 
 Can't fight the feeling 
 Say I got a couple issues, I got a couple issues 
 I can't leave my smoke 
 We get high as the ceiling 
 Can't fight the feeling 
 Yeah we all can't be all-stars 
 Life hits you man that shit can catch you off-guard 
 Take an L ride, there's a lot of benefits 
 But when you smoking in the car you start to reminisce 
 One day you moving in, freshman year conversating 
 The next moment you a senior and you're graduating 
 I was in college then I found my super powers 
 And I smoked a bit of sour, class is over in an hour 
 Like why the semester ain't over yet? 
 And they some young bulls tell me why they ain't older yet 
 And if they said we was a fade better doubt it all 
 Frat parties with the alcohol 
 So give me Coca-Cola, a hater tell them hola 
 Yeah I'm a money holder, and ain't nobody colder 
 Fuck it I be a star, I'm on my supernova 
 I can't fight the feeling, we smoke until it's over 
 Sitting back as the days go 
 You know we make pay roll 
 Yeah we get high as the ceiling 
 Can't fight the feeling 
 Say I got a couple issues, I got a couple issues 
 I can't leave my smoke 
 We get high as the ceiling 
 Can't fight the feeling 
 High as the ceiling 
 Can't fight the feeling 
 We get high as the ceiling 
 Can't fight the feeling
