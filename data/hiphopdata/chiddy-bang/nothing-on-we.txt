Yeah 
 Look what we have here, hero 
 And everything ain't what it seems 
 And this is for the people that's chasing they dreams 
 Get your money hustlin' love 
 So could you get your money hustlin' love 
 But don't let them take it, rules we breakin' 
 Tryin' to get it 'cause we overachieve 
 Mama I made it, now they hate it 
 But you could trust they got nothing on we 
 Nothing on we 
 And everybody needs a hero 
 Just another number, they rather you be a zero 
 But you could make it out, be patient with no surgery 
 Somebody call 9-1-1, it's an emergency 
 The kids need a hero, let us get bread 
 They follow everything, they seein' and embed in they head 
 Custodian clean, get Banks, bring Cody in 
 And I bet that you probably into that Nickelodeon 
 They gon' watch it on the TV screen 
 And when you sleep remember it and retrieve these dreams 
 We livin' the good life we don't need these fiends 
 And when we focus it's easier than the free throw seems 
 Cousins without clothes, tell them keep those jeans 
 Buzzin' they top rows, now we beat those teams 
 Victorious, and can we bring this to the chor-e-us 
 And sure he is, a boy meetin' world like Cory is 
 And everything ain't what it seems 
 And this is for the people that's chasing they dreams 
 Get your money hustlin' love 
 So could you get your money hustlin' love 
 But don't let them take it, rules we breakin' 
 Tryin' to get it 'cause we overachieve 
 Mama I made it, now they hate it 
 But you could trust they got nothing on we 
 They got nothing on we 
 And you could tell they got nothin' on we 
 And you could tell they got nothin' on we 
 You could tell they got nothin' on we 
 You could tell they got nothin' on we 
 And you tell could they got nothin' on we 
 And if you dream that you could grab it 
 When obstacles arrive you drive past it 
 I learned there's more to life when we had a smash hit 
 And the only thing guaranteed in life is a casket 
 That's why I live it up 
 They try to rob me of my dreams, they told me give it up 
 Uh, I said I refuse, this journey I pursue 
 And what I do to haters, I made them my own muse 
 Kinda funny, I'm amused 
 They say your mind is the most powerful thing to use 
 But I hope it's just powerful as the Pope is 
 Beamer, Benz, or Bentley, like Ford I got Focus 
 Yeah see you could do it if you follow with 
 Look into the stars, they shootin' with no hollow tips 
 And it isn't what it seems 
 So just like Yeezy, we steady gettin' out our dreams 
 That's G.O.O.D 
 And everything ain't what it seems 
 And this is for the people that's chasing they dreams 
 Get your money hustlin' love 
 So could you get your money hustlin' love 
 But don't let them take it, rules we breakin' 
 Tryin' to get it 'cause we overachieve 
 Mama I made it, now they hate it 
 But you could trust they got nothing on we 
 They got nothin' on we 
 And you could tell they got nothin' on we 
 And you could tell they got nothin' on we 
 You could tell they got nothin' on we 
 You could tell they got nothin' on we 
 And you tell could they got nothin' on we
