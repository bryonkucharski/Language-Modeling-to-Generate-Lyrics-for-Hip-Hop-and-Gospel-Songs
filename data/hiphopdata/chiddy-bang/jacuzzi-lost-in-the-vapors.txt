What up with you? I know you're probably not used to this 
 And your ex, man, always on some stupid shit 
 But she don't care, check her attendance, she's present 
 Seen her at night, I caught her at the crescent 
 Like it in the tub, this what I tell her when the time is right 
 I finally say what I'm supposed to when my mind is right 
 And soon I fly, and soon bye bye 
 She got that African pride, Kumbaya 
 Chiddy is a native and I put her on my latest 
 But she kinda tripping saying that we are related 
 And I can't even call it, they say love is overrated 
 In the jacuzzi till the sunrise, dumb high 
 Got a crib, got a spot, you could come by 
 Got the smoke that have you faded off of one try 
 She got them soft legs, she got them plump thighs 
 And a bathing suit that is something that is fun-size 
 We got a jacuzzi 
 And we gon' use it later 
 And yeah I got an Uzi 
 Oh wait it's just my neighbor 
 But you don't gotta worry 
 Just pass the rolling papers 
 I'm out of my mind 
 I be lost in the vapors 
 We got a jacuzzi 
 And we gon' use it later 
 And yeah I got an Uzi 
 Oh wait it's just my neighbor 
 But you don't gotta worry 
 Just pass the rolling papers 
 I'm out of my mind 
 I be lost in the vapors 
 When a life is kinda hectic and sometimes it ain't all right 
 So that's why we stay chilling cause the water feels right 
 Take it to the hot tub, feelings start bubbling 
 I'mma need twice as much girls, that's doubling 
 Cup is on half fill, faded had mad spills 
 She congratulate for the Guinness like boy you have skill 
 But these girls around here, they won't get you far 
 They either far too kind or kinda from afar 
 That's when you gotta screen them, hopefully someone seen them 
 And if they ain't top notch, why the hell you bring them? 
 But you are, cause you made it up here, upstairs 
 Now we kicking it in my jacuzzi 
 And this a rollcall, thank you for this movie 
 You are just a supporter, a hater call you a groupie 
 Smoking till it's dark out, things tend to pop out 
 She know I'mma give it to her, wait until we hop out 
 We got a jacuzzi 
 And we gon' use it later 
 And yeah I got an Uzi 
 Oh wait it's just my neighbor 
 But you don't gotta worry 
 Just pass the rolling papers 
 I'm out of my mind 
 I be lost in the vapors 
 We got a jacuzzi 
 And we gon' use it later 
 And yeah I got an Uzi 
 Oh wait it's just my neighbor 
 But you don't gotta worry 
 Just pass the rolling papers 
 I'm out of my mind 
 I be lost in the vapors
