(Sample) 
 Yeah, uh, yeah 
 We finally made it 
 Celebration in order, happy belated 
 This what you waitin' for, you know we make it raw 
 London City we love you, that's who made it for 
 In my heart you will remain, hope that this trip makes for picturesque change 
 And we on a jet plane, platinum dreams gladly go 
 This that Beatles feel, remember Abbey Road? 
 Shout out with the words, what a antic 
 And we got the wifi, Virgin Atlantic 
 Turbulence can't disrupt my pen 
 And I swear's my time, say what up Big Ben 
 I'mma up this trend and live it up as a teen, 
 To go to the palace to say 'what up' to the Queen 
 Hit up Westwood, do interviews porb'ly take calls 
 University of Cambridge May Ball 
 Get your ticket ready, it's Chiddy Bang in London 
 They can never bring me down I'm always up to somethin' 
 Contrary to your beliefs I'm still the same dude 
 Only difference is the pilots' talk 'n' plane food 
 Hey London 
 I know you've prob'ly never seen me before, 
 And though I'd love to stay and kick it some more, 
 I gotta get back on my tour 
 So the only thing I gotta say's 
 Hey London 
 You gotta know I love you for sure, 
 Just let me in 'cause you opened the door 
 If I gotta get back on my tour, 
 The only thing I gotta say is 
 And the bosses on we head 
 Now say what up when we across the pond 
 'Yeezy said "Jesus Walks, my cross is on" 
 Dream of a residence that's heaven-sent, a loft upon 
 Less serious raps, I'm what you call a clown 
 I'm the raft if ever your bridge fallin' down 
 Drive on opposite I take those roads play right 
 I'll prob'ly take her to Shakespeare's Globe 
 If the world get cold then we numb to the reality 
 I break life into pieces, let's hit the gallery 
 My you're platinum baby you're not sterling 
 Rollercoaster ride, London Eye, Merlin 
 From you they tried to block me like Berlin 
 And this that silk flow I bring to you, Persian 
 My G's stitched like LiLo 
 And by the way, meet me at Heathrow 
 Hey London 
 I know you've prob'ly never seen me before, 
 And though I'd love to stay and kick it some more, 
 I gotta get back on my tour 
 So the only thing I gotta say's 
 Hey London 
 You gotta know I love you for sure, 
 Just let me in 'cause you opened the door 
 If I gotta get back on my tour, 
 The only thing I gotta say is
