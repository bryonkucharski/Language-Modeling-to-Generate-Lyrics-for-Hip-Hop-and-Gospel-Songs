 Problems - money come with that 
 I just ease the pain by chopping trees like a lumberjack 
 Thundercat, you ain't even ready for my summer raps 
 Coolin' on a minute I'm in to take the world, yeah I'm finna 
 It's young kidster, ain't nobody hotter than 
 Soon as I step in the building, shit she forgot her man 
 College ran to the point I had to leave, was not a fan 
 Maybe a little not my email get a lot of spam 
 I'ma wild out, basically 
 That means I probably don't care about what you say to me 
 I got a couple bad bitches, Lord, pray for me 
 Look in the mirror we the shit that they pray to be 
 And they pay to me 
 Roll the blunts make a mixed drink 
 And don't you dare say that I ever care what a bitch think 
 She ain't a single but for me she tryna lip sync 
 And once the lips link, now that's instinct

 We on Cloud 9, welcome to the mothership 
 Second verse is dedicated to bitches that's medicated 
 Off the pine tree, and she a dime piece 
 If I forgot you then make sure that you remind me 
 I'm only partying until I see my (?) 
 When I achieve, so is you down to get, listen 
 And livin', our lifestyle, they are so addictin' 
 I said they always be amazed how I rap fly 
 Hey yo, my eyes is currently upon your backside 
 Why? I stay gone off the loud purp 
 They gonna drop you if you ever try to crowd-surf 
 I'll touch a ball and say my style hurts 
 I get your number but I'm never gonna dial first 
 But I'm lovin' that 
 Go have fun with that 
 'Fore I jump out the window, I tell 'em "run it back"
