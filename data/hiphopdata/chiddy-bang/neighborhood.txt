(Verse 1: Chiddy) 
 Come take a look in my neighborhood, another day up in the ghetto 
 And grandma cookin' got the breakfast in the kettle 
 Was nothin' like you were picturin', ever before 
 Revenge is probably probable, they settle the score 
 Shit, we don't settle for less, we settle for more 
 We never was ballin' and still without the credit we score 
 It's Bob Marley, we just lookin' for Redemption 
 And we find ways to claim the kids to get exemptions 
 Uh, then I used to play the cookout 
 And then I went the book route, now all you rappers look out 
 Just a Kid in the Hall, Arsenio 
 She could give me knowledge, high definition, Vimeo 
 I won't give a penny though, and still the boys all fuego 
 And what I spit is magic, like it's Vegas at the trade show 
 So rollin' late is good, my homies made it good 
 And this is just another day up in my neighborhood 
 The neighborhood ain't the same no more 
 Used to ride the bus now we ride on tour 
 Used to dress plain now we on the plane 
 Used to play games now we live the game 
 The neighborhood is just what you find 
 Used to open up now we headline 
 And even though it's crazy I'll be just fine 
 And I promise you that I'll be comin' back sometime 
 (Verse 2: Killer Mike) 
 Come take a look at my neighborhood, see a little girl with the glow 
 Timidly tellin' momma what momma already know 
 See momma faced the same situation years ago 
 Sixteen to seventeen odd years or so 
 Momma was a pregnant sophomore in ninety-fo' 
 She worked hard went to school and made it out the ghetto 
 Now momma sittin' in the living room, trippin' fool 
 Wonderin' how her baby done got pregnant skippin' school 
 Momma just cried, just cursed 
 Momma lookin' at the sky askin' Lord am I cursed? 
 Am I cursed, Lord not my baby 
 There ain't no charms in the world this crazy 
 The girl's ain't smart and the boy's just lazy 
 And unlike us, they'll never make it 
 So momma makes the heavy-hearted decision 
 To take her daughter to clinic even though she is a Christian 
 The neighborhood ain't the same no more 
 Used to ride the bus now we ride on tour 
 Used to dress plain now we on the plane 
 Used to play games now we live the game 
 The neighborhood is just what you find 
 Used to open up now we headline 
 And even though it's crazy I'll be just fine 
 And I promise you that I'll be comin' back sometime 
 (Verse 3: Chiddy) 
 Come take a look at my neighborhood, Nigerian queen named Geraldine 
 Made it to the US, she was only eighteen 
 We ain't have a great scheme, no MBA 
 And when she came she stayed at the YMCA 
 Go figure, magna cum laude they should honor us 
 Had an only daughter with a man named Donatus 
 And you better swell, had a second child 
 Moved to New Jersey, we could turn the sorrow to a smile 
 Nobody would bet me up, such a juvenile 
 They say the middle child's always a little wild 
 But I'm only guilty of my innocence 
 Relate to Wyclef, Memoir Of An Immigrant 
 From a place where they tell you poverty's imminent 
 Momma's stressed out at work, now that's legitimate 
 Now they could hate the hood, my family made it good 
 And this is just another day up in my neighborhood 
 The neighborhood ain't the same no more 
 Used to ride the bus now we ride on tour 
 Used to dress plain now we on the plane 
 Used to play games now we live the game 
 The neighborhood is just what you find 
 Used to open up now we headline 
 And even though it's crazy I'll be just fine 
 And I promise you that I'll be comin' back sometime
