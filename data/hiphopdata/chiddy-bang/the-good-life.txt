Man I'm looking for the good life 
 Something that you can't imagine 
 It's something you don't know 
 Man I'm looking for the good life 
 Baby girl I got a ticket, do you wanna go? 
 Swelly, swelly, swelly, swelly, swelly, swelly, swelly I call 
 And we could have a good night 
 Show me that you got some good sense 
 Show me what you know 
 Make your trunk go 
 Make your make your trunk go 
 Make make make make make make your trunk go 
 Man I gotta be fresh and I gotta be I'll 
 We locate from the jungle where it's killed or be killed 
 And I'm a get mine, don't care how you feel 
 In an artificial world where nothing is real 
 We searching for wild for something that's greater 
 And hopefully I'll make it there sooner or later 
 Remember I was younger and I didn't have a thing 
 And then I had a dream they call Martin Luther King 
 I'm swelly on top for the world it seems 
 Cash rules everything around me get C.R.E.A.M. 
 Good morning, to my haters all I say is good night 
 They ask me what I'm looking for, I need a good life 
 Man I'm looking for the good life 
 Something that you can't imagine 
 It's something you don't know 
 Man I'm looking for the good life 
 Baby girl I got a ticket, do you wanna go? 
 Swelly, swelly, swelly, swelly, swelly, swelly, swelly I call 
 And we could have a good night 
 Show me that you got some good sense 
 Show me what you know 
 Make your trunk go 
 Make your make your trunk go 
 Make make make make make make your trunk go 
 I bet you know now if you didn't know then 
 I step into the booth and it's time to go in 
 And P got the bass turned up the low end 
 And this is that soul for the big o' ten 
 I never thought that I would be a man in the game 
 I brush off my shirt where there used to be a stain 
 I came a long way where I wasn't so fly 
 Made music like Kweli just to get by 
 I never had a job, but that couldn't stop him 
 'Cause now I get paid and I never clock in 
 And I will never stumble, fall, or take a pay cut 
 I'm in that elevator and I'm on my way up 
 Man I'm looking for the good life 
 Something that you can't imagine 
 It's something you don't know 
 Man I'm looking for the good life 
 Baby girl I got a ticket, do you wanna go? 
 Swelly, swelly, swelly, swelly, swelly, swelly, swelly I call 
 And we could have a good night 
 Show me that you got some good sense 
 Show me what you know 
 Make your trunk go 
 Make your make your trunk go 
 Make make make make make make your trunk go
