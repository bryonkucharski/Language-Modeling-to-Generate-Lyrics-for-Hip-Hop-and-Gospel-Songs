(Ray Charles) Ooh boy, open your eyes 
 A girl like me ain't waitin' all night 
 Ooh boy, better think twice 
 I got that honey, that sugar, that spice (Ray Charles) 
 [Verse 1]Yeah, hey yo I'm feelin' like Ray Charles I got my shades on, I don't know where they are You couldn't find me even if you had a radar And I spit rapidly AKAR I make the music with the soul of a blind man They be amazed how I get them ladies that cry, "yeah" And they try to do it, but they're blind to the fact That they're stuck in a trap and stayin' right where they at But I'm Ray Charles, Miss A calls Talkin' to my dime and I miss 8 calls And I spit tough, bet you I'mma last Great Wall I'm goin' ape y'all, I'm the new Ray Charles I don't need no walking stick, my shit cost a grip I get out the mouthwash if you talkin' shit And I can hear the evil, but I won't see it And if the blunt go out, you better reheat it
