Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go 
 Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go 
 Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go 
 Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go 
 Here we go 
 Them other rap dudes ain't near me though 
 This that shit for your stereo 
 Hit Louis Vuitton, yeah we go 
 Back atcha, spectacular 
 Flip shit round here, no spatula 
 The way they bite my shit like Dracula 
 And if the shortie fine, then I get back to her 
 And I love this game like Mario 
 But my flow is just like cardio 
 Intensive, offensive 
 And they ask why your belt expensive 
 They can't see me even if they had lenses 
 Top lonely, give a fuck about friendses 
 'Cause I'm a lonely stoner, pop Corona 
 College dropout, no diploma 
 Here we go 
 If you feel the heat in the kitchen 
 Or just washing dishes 
 Or dancin' for tuition 
 With the big dreams and wishes 
 Don't stop to listen 
 Just keep tryin' to get it 
 Cause you gon' get there 
 Put your hands in the air and say 
 Here we go 
 Here we go-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh 
 Here we go-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh 
 Here we go, we go, we go-uh-oh-oh 
 Here we go-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh 
 And I think I have the last laugh 
 And I pass class 
 Told them I was done with it 
 Opposite Of Adults, let's have fun with it 
 I'm a genius, and so is Xaphoon 
 Stay up, nocturnal shit, raccoon 
 Rap soon, holla at you later 
 They say we bout to blow up, Al-Qaeda 
 And this trap was just a favor 
 That turned into a classic, hater 
 I run rap like a master dater 
 You take forever to make a procrastinator 
 Blind niggas can't see shit 
 And he a story of Victoria Secret 
 That's only if she keep it 
 Never mistake kind-ness for weakness 
 Here we go 
 If you feel the heat in the kitchen 
 Or just washing dishes 
 Or dancin' for tuition 
 With the big dreams and wishes 
 Don't stop to listen 
 Just keep tryin' to get it 
 Cause you gon' get there 
 Put your hands in the air and say 
 Here we go 
 Here we go-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh 
 Here we go-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh 
 Here we go, we go, we go-uh-oh-oh 
 Here we go-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh 
 A hater tried to stop me on my way, today 
 I got to get my ooh get out the way, my way, my way 
 Here we go 
 Here we go-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh 
 Here we go-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh 
 Here we go, we go, we go-uh-oh-oh 
 Here we go-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh 
 Here we go-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh 
 Here we go-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh 
 Here we go, we go, we go-uh-oh-oh 
 Here we go-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh 
 Here we go-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh 
 Here we go-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh 
 Here we go, we go, we go-uh-oh-oh 
 Here we go-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
