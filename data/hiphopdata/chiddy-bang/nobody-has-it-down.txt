Yeah, uh, ok, yeah, uh 
 Yeah, ok, all right, yeah, uh 
 Hey yo I step into the room like the freshest of the year 
 And me not being successful has ever been a fear 
 These people say they red carpet but never do appear 
 And I just be there with the shit that I wear 
 Oh yeah, it's something bad bitches do to me 
 Shit I'm about to take this ship and this is mutiny 
 I'm the mayor of the Swelly Community 
 And that wack shit has never been cool to me 
 It's dangerous, big shout to Mystico 
 They say they getting fly, I think its fictional 
 We puff medicinal in thirty minute intervals 
 And that's a minimal, does that make me a criminal? 
 Yeah Chiddy sick and I'm about to give you the scoop 
 Hop in that whip and one button shit through the roof 
 I keep females dancing in the hula hoops 
 And I don't gotta talk about it, what we do is proof 
 Yeah nobody has it down 
 They try to approach by example but nobody goes around 
 Yeah nobody has it down 
 And at the end of the day, they try to tell you how 
 Nobody has it down 
 Nobody really has it figured out 
 Nobody has it down 
 But me 
 Nobody has it down but me 
 On second thought they probably never will, trust me 
 I say these niggas couldn't see me in the physical 
 Play my position and they condition is critical 
 We used to knock on these doors with the hopes of getting in 
 It's residential cause every moment we living in 
 And that's fantastic as faith would have it we feeling lit 
 Shorty I'm finna take you home in a little bit 
 Getting road head, we got drive 
 I'm a hop in the whip and grab a combo from Popeyes 
 And nobody is like me this shit's kinda hard to describe 
 Hungry for recognition I needed a high five 
 Man success is so sweet I can taste it 
 I hit the blunt if it's Kool Aid on that late shit 
 Still money is the best kind of fragrance 
 So you be smelling like shit if you never make it 
 Yeah nobody has it down 
 They try to approach by example but nobody goes around 
 Yeah nobody has it down 
 And at the end of the day, they try to tell you how 
 Nobody has it down 
 Nobody really has it figured out 
 Nobody has it down 
 But me
