They say hello, they say aloha, they say bonjour 
 I'm bout to kill this shit I think I need an encore 
 These other rappers need to focus on they songs more 
 If you ain't faded then you need to hit the bong more 
 I said I'm fly get the words in, someone bring the herbs in 
 Chicks is like a plane, only like them if they virgins 
 But, I exquisitely quote 
 Been through slippery slopes, now I figure we toast 
 Toast, there's no traffic up here, yeah we run the sky 
 Homie, I done seen everything, London eye 
 Uh uh, and ain't nobody fresher 
 Semester to semester, my Carmen is Electra 
 His hiatus might accept us 
 Say bye to my professors 
 20 light bulbs on the table of my dresser 
 G-Star, I got a crazy dumb collection 
 Opposing parties, you will never ruin the election 
 Yeah, we bring the star out 
 We bring the women and the cars and the cards out 
 This is a toast of celebration, bring a glass out 
 And we can do this until we pass out 
 Yeah, we bring the star out 
 We bring the women and the cars and the cards out 
 This is a toast of celebration, bring a glass out 
 And we can do this until we pass out 
 (Pass out, pass out, pass out, pass out, pass out, pass out, pass out, pass out, pass out, pass out, pass out, pass out, pass out, pass out, pass out) 
 I'm bout to pass out 
 I'm bout to shatter in the game, bring a glass out 
 Ok, I'm goin' crazy and insane, I'm on a fast route 
 So I'm gettin' money, baby I'm about to cash out 
 I said it's Chiddy Bang mania, schooled in Pennsylvania 
 She sucked me in the neck, vampire Transylvania 
 Rappin' to make words rhyme, that's not trainin' ya 
 Success, we're attainin' ya, bullets we are aimin' ya 
 Pop, we throw it in our bare hands 
 I'm a rare man, my logo's the Air man 
 Grade A flow, but I gotta put the effort in 
 Me and Xaphoon movin' up, we the Jeffersons 
 Please bring my letters in, A-list, put this on your playlist 
 Probably heard us through the grapevines, some Marvin Gaye shit 
 Watch me as I spit in daytime and make your face flip 
 Travel out to Scotland and back, now that's a day trip 
 Yeah, we bring the star out 
 We bring the women and the cars and the cards out 
 This is a toast of celebration, bring a glass out 
 And we can do this until we pass out 
 Yeah, we bring the star out 
 We bring the women and the cars and the cards out 
 This is a toast of celebration, bring a glass out 
 And we can do this until we pass out
