When the bass knock the beat so hard 
 Got the 808 drum to make your face knot 
 Other rappers they chill but we still flow ill 
 Got the shit to make you rock like Aesop 
 We gon' stay hot, that's forever and ever 
 Like to vacate where the weather is better 
 Flyer than a bird, we ain't on the same feather 
 Track number two, never 
 We onto new things 
 This the type of jam to get loose with 
 And when they play us on the radio, "Who's this?" 
 Change the rules, throw away the rubric 
 And if you hating, you can only be useless 
 Hella smoke when we be ride, straight Snoop shit 
 And I ain't never told a lie 
 See the truth is that we do this to the snare 
 Live from the home of the Prince of Bel-Air 
 Well, if you ain't got it then it's straight welfare 
 And you can tell we're above and beyond 
 Pro James Bond 
 And this fly shit is a part of me 
 And don't I keep it flowing like an artery 
 Take cash, dreams never shatter 
 We ain't step it up we just raised up the ladder 
 Gaze at us when we race past 
 Brand new Chiddy with the Ms. Kate Nash, yeah 
 Skeleton, you are my friend 
 But you are made of bone 
 And you have got no flesh and blood 
 Running through you to help protect the bone 
 Skeleton, we have been friends for years 
 And you have seen me through some trials 
 And tribulations and some tears 
 But everybody thinks I'm weird 
 Yeah, me too, keep a bad chick right near me too 
 Can you hear me, do you understand 
 The words comin' out of my mouth 
 Swelly, no doubt 
 Probably in a row by the exit 
 Reckless on a plane, eating breakfast 
 Not a SAT, so don't test this 
 Your favorite rapper cool but we be on some next shit 
 Calamari, I'm sorry, we got the best food 
 I'm in the lab, in a fetus like a test tube 
 From where it's hotter than a sauna 
 If you are arriving then you're probably a goner 
 Yeah, they may ball but they're probably Juwanna 
 And whenever I am off then I'll probably be on her 
 I get to zonin' and then I zone off 
 For this fly shit you gotta cut your phone off 
 Phone lost, higher at the telegan 
 This is not a freestyle, it's a skeleton 
 Skinny rapper in the room, I'm an elephant 
 Stay clear of all the birds and the pelicans 
 Shake the bass and then we take the place 
 All swell, Carvel, this takes the cake 
 F Jakes the snakes, push him down the stairwell 
 And this is live from the pilot, Air Swell 
 And I should have known that it wouldn't be long until you 
 You've got me standing in an awkward position
