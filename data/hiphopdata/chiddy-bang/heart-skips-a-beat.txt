My heart skips-skips-skips-skips-skips-skips a beat. 
 Olly Murs, Chiddy Bang 
 Them girls make your heart skip like like 
 I can see, you're not yourself 
 Even when you're here, with me 
 I know that you're some, where else 
 So put another record on 
 Kiss and leave me on 
 Nothing really matters when we're dancing 
 Listen to the same sad song playing on repeat 
 'Cause every time we come this close, my heart skips, skips a beat 
 So come on, spin me around 
 Now I don't wanna go home 
 'Cause when you hold me like this you know my heart skips, skips a beat 
 I know I should, but I can't leave it alone 
 And when you hold me like this that's when my heart skips, skips a beat 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 So, hung up 
 We can't, let go 
 If you really have, to leave 
 One more time just move, me slow 
 So put another record on 
 Play it on repeat, 
 Nothing really matters when we're dancing 
 Cause all you need to know, is what you do to me, 
 And every time you hold me close, my heart skips, skips a beat 
 So come on, spin me around 
 Now I don't wanna go home 
 'Cause when you hold me like this you know my heart skips, skips a beat 
 I know I should, but I can't leave it alone 
 And when you hold me like this that's when my heart skips, skips a beat 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 Hey, you make my heart skip a beat like 
 Hey lady let me take you out to eat like 
 Uh I'm fittin' to knock it out the park girl 
 So put your boyfriend on, three strikes 
 Outta here, greedy I don't gotta share 
 We gon' be up till the morning we don't gotta care 
 I'ma sit back and play my cards like solitaire 
 You and your friends come with us, like we outta there 
 Olly Murs, Chiddy yeah! 
 So come on, spin me around now I don't wanna go home 
 'Cause when you hold me like this you know my heart skips, skips a beat 
 I know I should, but I can't leave it alone 
 So when you hold me like this that's when my heart skips, skips a beat 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 Heart skips, skips a beat 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 My heart skips, skips a beat
