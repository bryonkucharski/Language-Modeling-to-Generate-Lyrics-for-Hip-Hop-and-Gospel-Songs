Is he moving too fast? Is she moving too slow? 
 She telling me that I'm silly, but I'm only 2-0 
 And it sucks that she just want to be friends with me 
 I try to put her on where I'm at mentally 
 I'm full of energy 
 At times I need a remedy 
 For lack of things that interest me 
 But still her body is tempting me 
 She just keep rejecting me 
 Why she keep stressing me? 
 Screaming like "Don't touch me bitch, I don't got leprosy" 
 Maybe we wasn't meant to be 
 But I was down Bonnaroo, Tennessee 
 In the RV, I can shut down a stage 
 Casey had the veggies on the bus, we smoked a pound of haze 
 Digress the tree can cold stress 
 When you feeling a bad bitch, but she showing you no interest 
 Sending letters with no address 
 And she never gon' get it so let it rest 
 Does she love me? 
 No sir 
 Does she want me? 
 No sir 
 I think she hates me 
 What has she done for me lately? 
 Does she love me? 
 No sir 
 Does she want me? 
 No sir 
 I think she hates me 
 What has she done for me lately? 
 I'm high with no intent to land 
 I seem to fall for the girls with the short attention spans 
 Who just wanna rendezvous 
 I would take her on a date, to a nice restaurant 
 But I got too much on my plate 
 Said I'm here for a day 
 She hit me three hours late 
 Found out I left the city, bet she had the sour face 
 Told her I would kick it with her whenever I return 
 But that was based on the premise that she was my concern 
 Searching for serious, life 
 Then I was fast 
 Had me speeding on this racetrack, furious 
 The kinda chick, the flyest nigga in the school he had her 
 But eff that, I'm trying to focus on what truly matters 
 I like 'em usually bad, always on punishment 
 Having a conversation, wishing I could punish it 
 And why the fantasy so far from the truth, huh? 
 Running in circles playing Duck, Duck, Goose, huh? 
 We take the shit any slower, then we gonna hold up traffic 
 Only hit the blunt once, then she fuckin' pass it 
 I knew we wasn't compatible 
 Quarterback my feelings to the side, that's a lateral 
 I wish that I could be satisfied 
 I wish you would let me have a try 
 But there's a problem with you and I 
 Now it's Chi-town, do or die 
 Does she love me? 
 No sir 
 Does she want me? 
 No sir 
 I think she hates me 
 What has she done for me lately?
