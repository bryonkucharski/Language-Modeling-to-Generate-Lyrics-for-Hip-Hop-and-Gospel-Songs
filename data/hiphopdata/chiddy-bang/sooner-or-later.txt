I am going to play for you our first tune tonight it's going to be about four tunes 
 And the first tune, here it goes 
 1, 2, 3 
 Now when them fights go down 
 Them lights go down 
 In villas and the village people might be round 
 THey say that all the people gonna like me now 
 Because I talk about the issues in this life we found 
 All through the country people getting slain 
 Priority religion disobey get hanged 
 I know some little kids quick to get militant 
 Just give them packs of the gun 
 They really feel the clips 
 They told me not to worry 'bout the struggle 
 And they don't gotta worry 'cause it's subtle 
 Tell 'em about the government taking away the light 
 Aviation is ruined they say when you take a flight 
 Say when you take the continent from the white man threw 
 White man colonize wealth can't do 
 They fly G5 but they gotta land too 
 We explode like the land mines that they ran through 
 So we try palm trees in the sky 
 It's a beautiful day 
 I am just happy to be alive 
 I am playing with sling shots with renewable goods 
 Think you got it tough because you're in the hood? Negative 
 I am positive you would be in upset mode 
 When you wear the same thing like you got a dress code 
 I guess I am guilty of being privileged 
 'Cause while I am in the booth my cousin is in the village 
 I seen a boy with no father 
 His mom ain't around lifes harder 
 Picked up soccer he trying to go farther 
 Hair is a mess can't find him no barber 
 And this is what it's like 
 When you ain't got a life 
 I'm all they got left 
 But they trying to do right 
 And they feel my plight 
 They giving them incite 
 I know we gotta win 
 So then fly me a kite 
 We get by 
 The weather is just right 
 Say good morning when I see you 
 'Cause I gotta be polite 
 And I am living something different 
 'Cause this can't be the life 
 You don't got a chance so you better focus on your plans 
 I try to grind like children that sell pure water 
 The land of the lawless manslaughter 
 Negotatiate your price I'll take your offer 
 In the market where they sell them what did that cost her 
 I try to chase the gold out here 
 But honestly it's bumpy like the roads out here 
 And I advise if your salary is handsome 
 Vulu feli feli they will hold you for ransom 
 If you gotta take a glimpse of my family life 
 You will lose your mind Chris Brown on Grammy night 
 And this is what the news don't show 
 There is nothing on the table so the dudes the dude's don't grow 
 spoken: 
 Yeah 
 You see what this is man 
 We don't came through all types of o's 
 We still got people out there now 
 You know what I am saying 
 I am doing this for my cousin Remi 
 We gonna make it out the village some day 
 Sooner... later
