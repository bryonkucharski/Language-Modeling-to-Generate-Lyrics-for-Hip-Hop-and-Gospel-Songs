They waitin' for that decline 
 Pray that I lose my mind 
 They never want me to shine 
 But I observe that 
 Trouble I will serve that 
 Ear to the streets 
 Never will I give the curve back 
 Still movin' at a velocity 
 Still sensing the animosity 
 Hate mail is what they send me 
 But I separate letters like an apostrophe 
 Colossally, didn't come the same must of had two angles 
 He was isosceles 
 But now I'm Socrates 
 With philosophies 
 I'm in my tree house please don't bother me 
 And now it's lookin' like hella-smoke 
 Under aid they lettin' me pass the velvet rope 
 And it's like getting reckless 
 Feeling like a lone star Texas 
 Uh-huh I know what's on your mind 
 You don't think were gonna shine 
 I face you to prove you wrong 
 Thought I was week I tell you I am getting strong 
 This time it's gonna be different than the last time 
 I swear I'm gonna turn from a hobby and a pastime 
 Tomorrow gonna be better than today (yeah) 
 This will wash the pain away 
 Could you cheer for me when you see me? 
 Had to follow my dreams and they cannot believe me 
 But, see I need it for the cake I go 
 Like Tunday for the TV and the radio 
 Retro 80 flow 
 Hood make it crazy though 
 Puttin' work with music made me lazy though 
 Why 'cause I couldn't write enough rhymes 
 They say hip-hop is dead we bring the vital signs 
 Never trippin' 
 I'm on a different grind 
 Bring slaughter to your houses 
 Young Nickonine 
 See now tell whatcha get me wrong 
 If I told you in the studio I met Solange 
 If I said I command it like it's the Pentagon 
 Hatin' on even on the roof I'm upper echelon 
 But still forever we shine 
 Turn negative to positive I never decline 
 Uh-huh I know what's on your mind 
 You don't think were gonna shine 
 I face you to prove you wrong 
 Thought I was week I tell you I am getting strong 
 This time it's gonna be different than the last time 
 I swear I'm gonna turn from a hobby and a pastime 
 Tomorrow gonna be better than today 
 This will wash the pain away 
 Uh-huh
