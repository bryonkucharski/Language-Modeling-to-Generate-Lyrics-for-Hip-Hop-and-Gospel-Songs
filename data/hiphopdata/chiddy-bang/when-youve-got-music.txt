Dear music I would like to say thank you 
 'Cause I was down in the trenches and then you came through 
 I was thinking FAFSA, you chill me out and ill me out 
 Inspiration big picture you could capture 
 I could do that so I focus as if I just had a dosage 
 Dr. Dre Xxplosive so the people gotta notice 
 I double my kick game, I'm not new to stunts 
 I be taking harpoons, hope I don't get new to blunts 
 So I chill, music said Chidera you have a deal 
 Now my shit is leaking everywhere just like the oil spill 
 Boy it's real, I assure you that he's urgent 
 Cause nothing in this lifetime is really ever certain 
 Freestyle middle school if only it was that simple 
 College yeah we made it, faded behind them black windows 
 Car drive full of smoke, yeah we blowing off steams 
 I spit the Paul Pierce, and never change teams 
 When you're feeling down and alone 
 You should be thinking back that you got music 
 Where you go 
 You should shake it back when the beat is alright 
 It's alright 
 Yeah, I said musically, upper level that is where we soona be 
 Please take off your jewelry, that's time foolery 
 Robinhood, my success is good for the community 
 Fell in love with samples from diplomatic immunity 
 And now I used to shit the eat is just a spoon to me 
 Funny how the shit could get different, it all humors me 
 Back in the day with no beats, I would have no room to spaz 
 Know how to budget the paper, now that's consumer math 
 If they told them that I spit they would sooner laugh 
 Alexander McQueen, specials that Puma has 
 I never feel down, this game has it's high points 
 Vibing in the studio, prerequisite five joints 
 Sonically they had to tell him I'm a hedgehog 
 It's Mr. Everything-I-spit-will-make-your-head-nod 
 I think we back up on the track like let's jump 
 And we be Rapping in Arenas, that's the next blog 
 When you're feeling down and alone 
 You should be thinking back that you got music 
 Where you go 
 You should shake it back when the beat is alright 
 It's alright
