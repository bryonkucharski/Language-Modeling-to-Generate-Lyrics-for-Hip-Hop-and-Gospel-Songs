Late night whippin' it 
 Late night whippin' it 
 Late night, late night, late night, whippin' it 
 Late night whippin' it 
 We're magnificent 
 Music bumpin' loud I am not givin' in 
 Why? 'Cause I'mma pull it in the fourth quarter (Hey!) 
 Yeah, I go hard in the fourth quarter 
 Great night livin' it 
 Defense dribble it 
 I could say you have a chance, I would just be kiddin' then 
 Why? 'Cause I'ma pull it in the fourth quarter (Hey!) 
 Yeah, I go hard in the fourth quarter 
 Uh, call the swelly troops, this is victory 
 Remember junior high? They used to pick on me 
 Tell Gaga that I was born this way, became dope 
 And to the students, I used to be in the same boat 
 But when we start to pour get your rain coat 
 We gon' leave every motherfucker here drenched, soaked 
 And I'm a brainiac and this is swanky rap 
 Michael Sembello this Chiddy fellow's a maniac 
 Them haters try to locate whatever plane he's at 
 Droppin' anvils on him it's Animaniacs 
 Halftime superstar, fourth quarter legendary 
 They say that I was droppin' all mixtapes allegedly 
 Late night whippin' it 
 We're magnificent 
 Music bumpin' loud I am not givin' in 
 Why? 'Cause I'ma pull it in the fourth quarter (Hey!) 
 Yeah, I go hard in the fourth quarter 
 Great night livin' it 
 Defense dribble it 
 I could say you have a chance, I would just be kiddin' then 
 Why? 'Cause I'mma pull it in the fourth quarter (Hey!) 
 Yeah, I go hard in the fourth quarter 
 And this is just some fourth quarter antics 
 Who are you kidding? We be on some grown man shit 
 Text a chick 'cause I'm handsome, next we're spittin' at mansion 
 I bet you this, you ain't next to this 
 Cause my flow is like a light tantrum 
 And if you feelin' swelly, this is your anthem 
 Passport gettin' used up please stamp 'em 
 Said that shorty in the lobby a dancer 
 She down to get it? Yes is the obvious answer 
 I'ma spend this money, make it back 
 Gettin' first place in fact 
 'Cause we give 'em dope, Xaphoon he could lace the tracks 
 Baggies is purple and yellow just like a Laker hat 
 You don't fuck with Chiddy I see you rockin' your hater hat 
 I finish strong, they don't call me no more 
 Be the star they adore if you go hard in the four 
 One time, let the game simmer 
 I fuck around and hit the game winner 
 Late night whippin' it 
 We're magnificent 
 Music bumpin' loud I am not givin' in 
 Why? 'Cause I'mma pull it in the fourth quarter (Hey!) 
 Yeah, I go hard in the fourth quarter 
 Great night livin' it 
 Defense dribble it 
 I could say you have a chance, I would just be kiddin' then 
 Why? 'Cause I'ma pull it in the fourth quarter (Hey!) 
 Yeah, I go hard in the fourth quarter 
 Late night whippin' it 
 Late night whippin' it 
 Late night, late night, late night, whippin' it
