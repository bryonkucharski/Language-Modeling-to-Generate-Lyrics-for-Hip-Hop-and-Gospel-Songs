Chiddy:

 Everday oughta be a bad day for you 
 Chiddy: 
 That's right, uh 
 (Verse 1: Chiddy) 
 We used to be so strong 
 Back then we was right, now we so wrong 
 She was Beyonce, I could've got my Hov on 
 And when she hang up on me, I tell her hold on 
 Quit that shit, I don't use force 
 Today is a bad day, we've been divorced 
 When I think about stress, I don't really need it 
 But this is plagiarism, cause my shortie just cheated 
 And shortie conceited 
 (She out of her mind, I wish she had Louis and a card in decline) 
 She had school with no aid, no HIV 
 Hope you don't get in the club with that fake ID 
 Why would you hurt somebody that you called your man for? 
 And I hope you get evicted by your landlord 
 But, she be messin' with me 
 And I'm hoping she lose my number indefinitely 
 So

 Everday oughta be a bad day for you 
 Everday oughta be a bad day for you 
 Theodore grams: 
 I guess you can't remember all the times that I was there 
 Your emotions on a roller coaster, no fun fair 
 You had me on the phone, but hate me when I come there 
 Xaphoon, let's cut it down to a drum snare 
 Yeah, yeah, just like that 
 I hope I hope you go deaf so you can't hear shit 
 Yeah, I hope I hope you go blind 
 Cause you look me in the face and you laugh when I cry 
 (Bad Day sample: Darwin Deez) 
 Maybe you should wonder why your apartment is always so empty 
 (Maybe you should wonder that) 
 Well I hope you get locked out of that apartment and have to call Jenny 
 (Oh, I hope you get locked out) 
 (Bad Day sample: Darwin Deez) 
 Cause everday oughta be a bad day for you 
 Everday oughta be a bad day for you 
 (Verse 2: Chiddy) 
 She's way too complex 
 When we argue, she takin' shit out of context 
 And, I know I could have did more 
 But I'm never home, I was always on tour 
 I could be anywhere in the world, had one wish 
 To be with you until you gave that dude a tongue kiss 
 And this is hard for me to say like a tongue twist 
 My heart don't beat for you so let the drum hit 
 And, you know I just got promoted 
 Now I be the boss and I hope you get demoted 
 Hapiness is a warm gun, live it fully loaded 
 And shit got worse when I exploded 
 Boom, I wrote it soon, I hope you brought a cab pay 
 And I hope you get detention on a half day 
 I wish I could use your blouse for an ashtray 
 Cause for you, everyday should be a bad day 
 (Bad Day sample: Darwin Deez) 
 Everday oughta be a bad day for you 
 Everday oughta be a bad day for you 
 Chiddy: 
 Xaphoon you crazy 
 But so am I

 Everday oughta be a bad day for you 
 Everday oughta be a bad day for you 
 Everday oughta be a bad day for you 
 Everday oughta be a bad day for you
