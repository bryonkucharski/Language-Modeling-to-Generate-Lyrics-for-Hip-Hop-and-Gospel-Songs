It started off with a rhyme and a dream 
 Made it the greatest and the latest 
 Now we fresh on the scene 
 Got the sample for the kids 
 Won't you ever grow up? 
 Went to Drexel and had classes, but I never showed up 
 I was writin' all day till my hands would hurt 
 Professors didn't appreciate it, called me a jerk 
 New boy needed to learn, but I never would 
 Pay attention in school is something that I never could, uh 
 And know with a beat, gotta be steaming 
 And we could work wonders over logic and reason 
 We on the hype now, they call it a buzz 
 And how we get the party popping, Baltimore club, uh 
 MySpace they could replay next 
 And you gotta have Xaph for the DJ set 
 No matter how they re-play us, they can never replace us 
 And any way you slice it now, homie, they came to take us 
 Sufjan Stevens sample: 
 You came to take us [yeah] 
 All things go, all things go [uh] 
 To recreate us [hey yo Xaphoon, we back son! ] 
 All things go, all things go [we did it! ] 
 We had our minds set [yeah] 
 All things go, all things go [uh] 
 You had to find it [uh] 
 All things go, all things go 
 Say hello to the game 
 The people know my name 
 And do they really love us, or is this just a fling? 
 And we be Peter Parker in love with the Mary Jane 
 So many people gone, so many people came, eh 
 This that brand new spontaneous 
 Dope flow, intraveneous 
 Miscellaneous grinding 
 Better late than never, I'm calling it perfect timing 
 But we goin' have a little bit of fun 
 'Cause when it's all done 
 You throw your sneaks up and call it a good run 
 I admit, that I would never rather them burn me 
 I don't know where I'm headed, but I know it's a journey 
 And my bags is packed, so can you hand me my itinerary? 
 I get attention like a soldier in the military 
 This is what you gotta notice today 
 We promise to make sure they never throw us away 
 Sufjan Stevens sample: 
 You came to take us [yeah] 
 All things go, all things go [uh] 
 To recreate us [uh] 
 All things go, all things go 
 We had our minds set [yeah] 
 All things go, all things go [uh] 
 You had to find it 
 All things go, all things go 
 You came to take us 
 All things go, all things go 
 To recreate us 
 All things go, all things go 
 We had our minds set 
 All things go, all things go 
 You had to find it 
 All things go, all things go
