Officially on top the moon 
 Things are looking up, things are lookin' 
 Out 2 space 
 Things are looking up, things are lookin' 
 Soon I'm gonna be a star 
 Things are looking up, things are lookin' 
 I just would touch the stars 
 Or am I out 2 Space 
 Gettin' money not the filthy way 
 Talk down still they stay 
 Right where they at, but me I'm aiming for the milky way 
 So things are looking up 
 I see them skyscrapers 
 Forget me I need a crib with some fly neighbors 
 Hi haters, anything I flow on, feels so comfy like a pair of cold hands 
 Teacher I am Present 
 The homie I be so gone 
 How I get here? I just paved the road that I drove on. So long! 
 (Yeah) 
 And this the feeling that they can't control 
 We taking off to the stars now 
 I'm getting stoned while my brother rolls 
 So me and Keith (Richards) will prolly blow it down 
 Cross it off the list, I am never off my shift

 Visibly on the moon visit me 
 Engage in astrocirricular activity

 It's a hard act to follow man 
 Call me Apollo man 
 Things are looking up and this is what I wallow in 
 Fresh dress press ironed like Solomon 
 Could you tell me how many chances I could I give a man? 
 Livin' grand home is where I rest do I feel out of place? 
 'Cause we resorted to be in orbit in outer space 
 Wanted the fame back when HOV made Lucifer 
 Just passed Jupiter tell the students I made my own rules 
 Give a fuck about them handbooks 
 They owe it to me like money that Uncle Sam took 
 They try to treat me like a graduated Grand Brook 
 That's a private school, chillin', yup, I've been cool 
 Team Swell the tightest crew 
 We eatin' so just allow us the right to chew 
 People love me say "Chiddy nobody tight as you! "
