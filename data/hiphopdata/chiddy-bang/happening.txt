It's your choice 
 What are you waiting for? 
 'Cause this is happening 
 Yeah, this is happening 
 Welcome to the life, maybe I'm good at living 
 Or maybe I could assist you at making good decisions 
 Yeah, I ain't tryin' for no game, I'm tryin' to play though 
 I would make the choice to put you on if you say so 
 But you a star and I'm leavin' in a minute 
 Your body, your language that I be readin' in a minute 
 And my money like Even, like Steven when I'm in it 
 And we on our last drink, we'll be leaving when we finished 
 It's your choice 
 What are you waiting for? 
 'Cause this is happening 
 Yeah, this is happening 
 Welcome to the life, doesn't it have a friend? 
 Head to the wedding unless a bad bitch gathering 
 'Cause the single girls all play the game, try and go out 
 She came with her girlies and you know they tryin' to show out 
 'Til lift-up time, we had that sit-back time 
 And my Cali girls always having kickback time 
 And you know that we gon' break 'em off, Kit-Kat time 
 I made her think it was hers but the choice is mine 
 So what's up? Is you down? 
 When you see me, give me daps and pounds 
 'Cause everybody want a hit of that OG 
 I smoke that shit and get high, low key 
 It's your choice 
 What are you waiting for? 
 'Cause this is happening 
 Yeah, this is happening 
 Ay yo, we 'bout to light this dutchie, is you down with it? 
 You know we feelin' so high, we off the ground with it 
 It's your choice, tell me now is you down with it? 
 It's your choice, baby, now is you down with it? 
 Hey yo, we 'bout to live it up, yeah, is you down with it? 
 And if they on that bullshit, don't come around with it 
 It's your choice, tell me now is you down with it? 
 It's your choice, baby, now are you down with it? 
 It's your choice 
 What are you waiting for? 
 'Cause this is happening 
 Yeah, this is happening
