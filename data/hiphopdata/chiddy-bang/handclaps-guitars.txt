Everybody's simple then and these niggas is simpletons 
 Tell them bitches fall back, just like they was limboin' 
 We still got a Acura but show time we be limoin' 
 Rest in peace to the dead, bring that white widow in 
 Chiddy's '90s baby, it ain't gold and shiny baby 
 She been tryin' to buy me lately 
 Got a temper tiny baby 
 Yeah, swelly is just a movement, hope you understand that 
 Yo, Xaph, it's crazy how we sample on that hand-clap 
 And that's quite amazing if they ask me 
 Shit, does somebody have a L that they could pass me? 
 I upgraded to a little more classy 
 I guess I got this in the bag, we should have tea 
 English girls, English girls, shorty said she came in part 
 To the fact I'm good with words, yeah I got that language arts 
 Cruisin' by the ocean 'cause I know this is a game of sharks 
 Music and money, bet I never let it change my heart 
 Oh oh ooh oh, I just came to party 
 Oh oh ooh oh, I just came to party 
 Oh oh ooh oh, I just came to party 
 Oh oh ooh oh, I just came to party 
 Grind don't stop, I'm on top 
 Liquor closes 9 o'clock 
 And they say I'm dripping swell, somebody should find a mop 
 I be where it's sunny then I'm touring where the climate drops 
 Watch for police then hit boutiques like it is time to cop 
 Yeah, I'm just trying to park, so can I find my spot 
 Paris complainin' sayin' we don't spend time a lot 
 I'm super chill, but I think that's just the pot in me 
 Plus we be feelin' like that movie that they gotta see 
 So, who hot as me? Take a bitch on a Oddyssey 
 We just smoke a lot of tree, it's good for the economy 
 Yeah I'm still up on my grizzly, Mike Conley 
 That was just a preview, 'cause they got nothing on we 
 Fresh whenever comin' out, mixtape laundry 
 Started off a van, elevated to an R&V 
 Then a few niggas got emotional, R&B 
 'Cause when your shit get in their face it really ain't hard to see 
 Oh oh ooh oh, I just came to party 
 Oh oh ooh oh, I just came to party 
 Oh oh ooh oh, I just came to party 
 Oh oh ooh oh, I just came to party
