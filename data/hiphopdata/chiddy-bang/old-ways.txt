Uh, yeah 
 And how the saying go, things change 
 Skinny dude, but the flow is the size of Ving Rhames 
 Pennies from my thoughts add up, I hope you bring change 
 I know these haters ain't want me to see my wings raise 
 Flowin' shoes polishin', rappers I demolish it 
 I done lost my mind, they needed a psychologist 
 They could care less back when I was still in colleges 
 And now the boy be in London, Theophilus 
 It's tough tryin' to end up on the paid route 
 The flow is medium rare, now bring a steak out 
 This is my medium, here, see how it plays out 
 They all buggin' me, I gotta pull a Raid out 
 Using it sparingly, forever will they cherish me 
 Before I black out, introduce my moment of clarity 
 I'm not the same, style change 
 But I can leave the game 
 Now I'm right back to my old ways 
 I take life so slow, every minute gotta go 
 Now I'm right back to my old ways 
 We only here for a little 
 So I'm somewhere in the middle 
 And I'm right back to my old ways 
 I'm not the same, style change 
 But I can leave the game 
 Now I'm right back to my old ways 
 Let's take them back to days when we had no radio plays 
 And we had to change up our ways, cause success brings 
 Difference, tryin' to keep it clean 
 While they litterin', snakes in the grass, they try to slither in 
 The rose that grew from concrete, not witherin' 
 And it's life so fast, the lights keep flickerin' 
 What goes around comes back, and that's the karma truth 
 I log onto my closet, that shit is Karmaloop 
 So I get a little fresh 
 My teachers used to hate me, but now I could pass the test 
 Got confidence, subconciousness 
 Makes me overlook all of my many accomplishments 
 But, see I get it like nobody else did 
 I found a deeper meaning, know what sense of self is 
 And I'm a die of old age 
 And stay true I reverted back to my old ways 
 I'm not the same, style change 
 But I can leave the game 
 Now I'm right back to my old ways 
 I take life so slow, every minute gotta go 
 Now I'm right back to my old ways 
 We only here for a little 
 So I'm somewhere in the middle 
 And I'm right back to my old ways 
 I'm not the same, style change 
 But I can leave the game 
 Now I'm right back to my old ways
