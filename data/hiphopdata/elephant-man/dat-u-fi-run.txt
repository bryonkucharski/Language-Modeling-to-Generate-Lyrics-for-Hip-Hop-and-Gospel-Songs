Girl nothing in life is free 
 A wam to her doggie 
 Want de money bag bust 
 The pussy fi run first 
 Iphone and deh purse 
 The pussy fi run first 
 She are curse go make it worse 
 The pussy fi run first 
 Real bad man nah nurse 
 Bout she wahn rent fi pay 
 The pussy fi run first 
 Ask me why the delay 
 The pussy fi run first 
 She wahn tax me everyday 
 The pussy fi run first 
 That you fi run 
 She no wahn give me the working 
 She better tink it over 
 And bend over if she wahn fi drive inna me rover 
 No gal cahn call me out 
 An nhame me out and want to clothe her 
 Bout she come from town 
 And live all the way inna hanover 
 Stand up firm 
 Nah make no gal come push me over 
 Like a key me turn her over 
 Ever like a car and over 
 Bout she want baby phat jeans 
 And expensive pullover 
 Tell her fi run de pussy first 
 Run de pussy first 
 Me hear yevette 
 A say me do her a ting she 
 Coudn't figet 
 De way me trick around 
 Get dat ting deh me a de skillest 
 A tell venice inna bedroom 
 Me a de illest 
 The 'mount a slam she get 
 She a ball she nearly fi death 
 And a tell bridget 
 Bout de work where me give it 
 Mek she hold note 
 Like admiral tippet 
 Say she ready fi to settle down 
 Swear to god live it 
 De rest of man dem where she slam 
 Already she regret
