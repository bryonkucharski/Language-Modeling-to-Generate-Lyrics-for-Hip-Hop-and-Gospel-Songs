Time on my hands since you've been away boy 
 I ain't got no plans 
 No, no, no, no. 
 And the sound of the rain, against my windowpain. 
 Is slowly, slowly driving me insane. 
 Boy, I'm going down 
 I'm going down 
 'Cause you ain't around, baby. 
 My whole world's upside down 
 Sleep don't come easy. 
 Boy, please believe me. 
 Since you've been gone, everything's going wrong. 
 Why'd you have to say goodbye? 
 Look what you've done to me 
 I can't stop these tears from falling from my eyes. 
 Oh Baby, 
 I'm going down. 
 I'm going down 
 'Cause you ain't around, baby. 
 My whole world's upside down. 
 You ain't around. Going down. 
 Ooh, Baby. I'm in love. 
 Going down. Oh, Oh, Oh, 
 I-I- I'm going down. 
 I'm going down. 
 'Cause you ain't around, baby. 
 My whole worlds upside down 
 Going down, going down 
 Oh, babe. 
 Don't want believe. 
 If I can't give my love to you 
 I'm so blue. 
 Going down. 
 Going down 
 You ain't around. 
 Baby, baby. 
 Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. 
 What did I do wrong? 
 Please forgive me, baby, and come on home. 
 Going down. 
 Going down. 
 Going down.
