Hey, boy, who's that in the alley with a knife in her hand? 
 I think it's that girl from the autograph stand. 
 She looks kind of sad, does she understand? 
 That we're only doing our job 
 Tryin' to make her happy 
 When we play these songs 
 But now the show is over 
 She's comin' over 
 Knife above her shoulder 
 I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you. 
 Run for your life 
 -You'll wish you had when she 
 Cuts you with a knife 
 -And leaves you 
 Lying on the sidewalk 
 -With your 
 Heart in your hands 
 Run for your life 
 -You'll wish you had when she 
 Cuts you with a knife 
 -And leaves you 
 Lying on the sidewalk 
 -With your 
 Heart in your hands 
 If you see a girl with a knife 
 Ridin' on your bus 
 With my name written on her face 
 Don't make a fuss, don't rush 
 Take time, this girl's dangerous 
 To guys like me 
 Who are on TV 
 Jamaican celebrities can hardly believe 
 That you're gonna act weird when you see 'em on the street 
 If you've seen what I've seen 
 Than you're better to believe, to believe me. 
 Run for your life 
 -You'll wish you had when she 
 Cuts you with a knife 
 -And leaves you 
 Lying on the sidewalk 
 -With your 
 Heart in your hands 
 Run for your life 
 -You'll wish you had when she 
 Cuts you with a knife 
 -And leaves you 
 Lying on the sidewalk 
 -With your 
 Heart in your hands 
 I like to drive by 
 Where you live at. 
 I never stop though 
 'Cause your wife is always home. 
 And I know if she were to look into my eyes, 
 She'd see that we are in love. 
 Yes, we are in love. 
 I'm so glad that we're together now. 
 -Can someone call security? 
 Did you get that package I sent you? 
 Run for your life 
 -Better run for your life 
 Cuts you with a knife 
 -Or she'll cut you with a knife 
 Lying on the sidewalk 
 -You'll be lyin' on the sidewalk 
 Heart in your hands 
 -Hands, yeah 
 Run for your life 
 -You better run for your life, boy 
 Cuts you with a knife 
 -Or she'll cut you with a knife 
 Lying on the sidewalk 
 -Leave you lyin' on the sidewalk 
 Heart in your hands 
 -Hands, yeah 
 Run for your life 
 -You'll wish you had when she 
 Cuts you with a knife 
 -And leaves you 
 Lying on the sidewalk 
 -With your 
 Heart in your hands 
 Run for your life 
 -You'll wish you had when she 
 Cuts you with a knife 
 -And leaves you 
 Lying on the sidewalk 
 -With your 
 Heart in your hands
