I don't know 
 Where I'm supposed to go 
 So I might just 
 Take my pride and go 
 Some people, they know, know everything 
 But I know that they don't know my heart 
 'Cause I believe in love 
 And I hope I can show you what I am here 
 And I don't believe love's for me 
 So won't you come around and prove me wrong 
 'Cause I, oh yeah I 
 Believe in love 
 And I hope I can show you what I mean 
 And I don't believe love's for me 
 So won't you come around and prove me wrong 
 Won't walk the world 
 Any different 
 And my path won't change until you 
 Make a wall and make me fall 
 And break me down 
 I don't know, I don't know 
 If I wrote this song in vain 
 (In vain, in vain, in vain) 
 I, oh yeah I 
 Believe in love 
 And I hope I can show you what I mean 
 And I don't believe love's for me 
 So won't you come around and prove me wrong 
 (Prove me wrong, yeah) 
 You don't know me 
 And I don't know you 
 Tell me why should I 
 Do oh... 
 So won't you come around and prove me wrong
