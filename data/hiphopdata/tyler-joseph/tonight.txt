The young boy wants to move ahead 
 And the old man sings rewind 
 I wonder when in this time line 
 We'll break to the other side 
 Maybe there's a span of time 
 When we feel we're neither nor 
 Not wanting to go back again 
 And not wanting to go forth 
 The point in life must be 
 Pretty dark and hopeless 
 Terrifying 
 And if you're asking me when that is 
 It must be tonight 
 It must be tonight 
 It must be tonight 
 It must be tonight 
 The old man sits all by himself 
 And thinks of better years 
 When he used to believe in stars 
 And would dream away his fears 
 The young boy moves so fast he doesn't 
 See the stars above 
 And all his dreams are crushed by old man 
 Who didn't dream enough 
 We must all agree 
 There's a point in life when darkness breaks our 
 Brittle hopes and dreams 
 And I'd say 
 It must be tonight 
 It must be tonight 
 It must be tonight 
 It must be tonight 
 It must be tonight 
 It must be tonight 
 It must be tonight 
 It must be tonight 
 Stay with me 
 And it must be tonight 
 It must be tonight 
 Save me tonight 
 It must be tonight
