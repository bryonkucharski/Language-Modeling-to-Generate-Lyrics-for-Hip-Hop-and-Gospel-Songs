I start to part two halves of my heart in the dark and I 
 Don't know where I should go 
 And the tears and the fears begin to multiply 
 Taking time in a simple place 
 In my bed where my head rests on a pillowcase 
 And it's said that a war's led but I forget 
 That I let another day go by 
 I want to be afraid but it seems that these days 
 I'm caught under water and I'm falling farther 
 My heart's getting harder, I'm calling my father 
 Am I screaming to an empty sky? 
 Empty sky, no way, that's me cause one half of my heart is free 
 Empty sky, no way, that's me cause the other half of my heart's asleep 
 Sing a song but don't believe 
 Blasphemy is just for me 
 Hypocrite, take your pick 
 Cause the poison's on my lips 
 Can I understand you? 
 Can I understand you? 
 Can I understand you? 
 Can I understand you? 
 Lights, camera, action, satisfaction 
 At your finger tips no one's lacking stuff 
 But it's not enough when it seems that 
 We have enough stuff just to blow stuff up 
 Lights, camera, stop! We're killing ourselves 
 Just to get to the top 
 But we won't stop talking about what we got 
 And how we all love it when we're loved a lot 
 Enough about you, let's talk about me 
 And how everybody thinks I'm just so free 
 Free? Did you hear the verse that came first 
 And how my own body's waging war on me? 
 I bet you didn't know something as absurd 
 There's a word that is said more than any other word 
 It's sorry, sorry 
 And I pray that the word was heard 
 Sing a song but don't believe 
 Blasphemy is just for me 
 Hypocrite, take your pick 
 Cause the poison's on my lips 
 Can I understand you? 
 Can I understand you? 
 Can I understand you? 
 Can I understand you? 
 I want to be alive 
 When you see my eyes 
 Can I see your eyes? 
 Can I see your eyes? 
 Can I see your eyes 
 Can I see your eyes? 
 Can I see your eyes? 
 Can I see? 
 I want to be alive 
 When you see my eyes 
 Can I see your eyes? 
 Can I see your eyes? 
 Let the water wash away 
 Everything that you've become 
 On your knees, today is gone 
 And tomorrow's sure to come 
 Tomorrow's sure to come
