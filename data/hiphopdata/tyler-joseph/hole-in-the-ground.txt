You once were oh-so-close 
 But I don't remember 
 Where you are and who you know 
 But come this September 
 You will fly on your own 
 Cause you got a letter 
 You must find, find your home 
 And it won't get much better 
 I try so hard 
 To fly but my heart 
 Won't go very far 
 No, no 
 And my own two hands 
 Will start bleeding again 
 And floor will turn to 
 To a hole in the ground 
 The plans that I make 
 Roads that I take break 
 To holes that will go 
 Where I don't know 
 They are solid grounds illusions 
 That write themselves off 
 As perfectly normal solutions 
 Pollutions in my eyes 
 My disguise will take me 
 Break me 
 Won't save me this time 
 There's a vision 
 But you won't save me this time 
 My decision for living 
 Isn't mine to decide and 
 You just seem oh-so-far 
 Past the stars and past my heart 
 I can almost feel you and I start 
 To close my eyes and sing a song 
 I will keep singing 'cause I'm wrong 
 But you were singing with me all along 
 I try so hard 
 To fly 
 But my heart 
 Won't go very far 
 No, no 
 And my own two hands 
 Will start bleeding again 
 And floor will turn to 
 To a hole in the ground 
 Do not be alarmed 
 If I fall into the sun 
 If I fall 
 And my own two hands will start bleeding 
 And then they will lower me 
 In to, to a hole in the ground
