You walk around like you are fine 
 So confident in life, so right 
 But then I found you were afraid 
 And that means life is not okay 
 I wonder what's inside your mind 
 And if there's anything to find 
 I hope that you awake some day 
 And see that life is not okay 
 I will sing for you a song 
 Tell me if you think that's wrong 
 If I let you know I'm here 
 'Cause I am falling down 
 I would laugh away the pain 
 Did you know I'd run all day 
 Just to maybe hear you say 
 That you are falling too 
 I know you are afraid of many things 
 But you need to let go 
 If you want to sing a praise 
 I will sing for you a song 
 Tell me if you think that's wrong 
 If I let you know I'm here 
 'Cause I am falling down 
 I would laugh away the pain 
 Did you know I'd run all day 
 Just to maybe hear you say 
 That you are falling too 
 I will sing for you 
 I will sing for you
