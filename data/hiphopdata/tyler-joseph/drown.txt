Here I come, come to you in the very clothes 
 That I killed, killed you in and now I know I'm alone 
 I walk to you, rain falls from you 
 Can you wash me, can you drown me? 
 I wanna be a lot of things, so much pent up inside of me 
 I wanna be stronger, too long I've sat here undecidedly 
 Planning strategy, half of me know it's all just a fallacy 
 Failing miserably, drastically and then I crash dramatically 
 Into a wall I've hit a hundred times before 
 And yet I still ignore the dark red blood stains on the floor 
 And I'm back in front of you, Lord, with the blood on the floor 
 Is the blood mine or yours? Don't wanna do this anymore 
 Back and forth between me and me and who you call me to be 
 You see a man free who thinks he has to buy a key 
 To a door but he can't 'cause he's poor and he can't 
 Fall down anymore 'cause he's already on the floor 
 And his heart is broken and all and this is his scar 
 But it's warm from crying 'cause he will try nine times 
 To realize nine crimes but he has more than nine lives 
 So he picks himself up and keeps fighting for the prize again 
 Here I come again to you 
 Just to show the blood soaked through 
 Through my bones and all I own 
 Is there a way for me to grow? 
 I walk to you, rain falls from you 
 Can you wash me, can you drown me, please? 
 Every time I feel selfish ambition is taking my vision 
 My crime is my sentence, repentance is taking commission 
 It's taking a toll on my soul, I'm screaming submission and 
 I don't know if I am dying or living 
 'Cause I will save a face for name's sake 
 Abuse grace, take a aim to obtain a new name in a newer place 
 But my name is lame, I can't walk and I ain't the same 
 And my name became a new destiny to the grave and 
 They say the ocean's blue but it's black right now 
 In the dark, on the sand, looking out at my crowd 
 Depression and drowning singing now the full parts 
 Of lightning reveals where the ocean stops and the sky starts 
 I've been told by the sky that the ocean I shall win 
 But it's hard for me to see where ocean stops, and where sky begins 
 A random strike of light reminds me of what is true 
 But right now the ocean is black and black the sky is too
