I know your tears more than you 'cause I see 'em so much 
 That's what happens when you're here with no trust, okay 
 I lied, cheated, you cried 
 You done worse shit, and I'm still here, right? 
 And motherfuck your friends 
 All them hoes hatin' 
 If you're not down, then what's your location? 
 I called and checked in every night and that was not probation 
 They gave they two cents and we ain't ask for no donation 
 Man, you on some other other shit 
 Just found out about my other other bitch 
 Went from "I love ya" to "Ya don't know who ya fuckin' with" 
 Fresh off of vacay and already need another trip 
 She said I had enough tries 
 Oh, and I'm the reason that she doesn't trust guys 
 What's the perfect girl if it's not the perfect time? 
 If you wanna leave fine 
 Just don't tell me you love me 
 You're gonna make it too hard for me 
 I wish you were ugly 
 It'd wouldn't be so hard to leave 
 'Cause baby I hate to love you 
 I can't make up my mind 
 'Cause right when I tell you it's over 
 By the end of the night, I be right back in bed witchu 
 I be right back in bed witchu 
 So don't tell me you love me 
 Wishin' I would've tried more 
 She wanted the truth 
 Truthfully I wish I lied more 
 'Cause when I was true, all I heard was buy more, 
 Fuck you, who is that? And I don't know why more 
 We were picture perfect and I tore it all apart 
 But if I pick up all the pieces we could still be a collage 
 Feelin' like we ended too soon 
 Used to stay home and do it in all the rooms 
 Back shots, I know what you like 
 Had you hittin' high notes and you don't even need no autotune 
 Nights I was Patron'ed up 
 Girls dressed alike lookin' like they cloned up 
 Same nights I wouldn't pick my phone up 
 And you was thinkin' "Damn boy, grow up!" 
 And I could still hear her leavin' 
 Crazy, when a heart breaks it never breaks even 
 I even found another girl that's perfect 
 And I'm the only reason we're not workin' 
 'Cause what's the perfect girl if it's not the perfect time? 
 And if you wanna stay, fine 
 Just don't tell me you love me 
 You're gonna make it too hard for me 
 I wish you were ugly 
 It'd wouldn't be so hard to leave 
 'Cause baby I hate to love you 
 I can't make up my mind 
 'Cause right when I tell you it's over 
 By the end of the night, I be right back in bed witchu 
 I be right back in bed witchu 
 So don't tell me you love me 
 So don't tell me you love me, whatever you do, whatever you do 
 So don't tell me you love me 
 So don't tell me you love me, whatever you do, whatever you do 
 So don't tell me you love me
