Imma' be paid forever 
 I look up 
 Finally Famous Nigga 
 I woke up working like a Mexican 
 That mean I work from 10 to 10 
 Then 10 to 10, then 10 again 
 Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline 
 All this bread can't be good for my cholesterol 
 Don't come round' talking loudly, fucking up my repertoire dawg 
 I can't lie bruh lately I've been stressing heavily 
 I'm sipping, popping, smoking on whatever take the pressure off 
 Diss you, FF Imperial till my burial 
 Dodging every bullet and venereal 
 Anti-fuckboy material till I'm dead, I'm living proof, 
 If you focus on what's in front of you and not what's in the peripheral 
 It's gone, word? Boy I seen drama on drama 
 Drama on drama over comma on comma 
 I'm bringing home dead prez, my house done feel like its haunted 
 I put the city on my back, right along with my garments 
 Went to sleep, snoring 
 I woke up working like a Mexican 
 That mean I work from 10 to 10 
 Then 10 to 10, then 10 again 
 Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline 
 I got 3 jobs like I'm Jamaican though 
 I need 3 wives like I was Haitian though 
 One cook, one clean, the other PMS'ing, ho Hablo ingles' 
 If police have questions they don't know what that mean nigga 
 They say Detroit going through the great depression 
 Still it's been depressed so long I can't even tell depression here 
 My homeboy still gon' pull up on them rims big as a Ferris wheel 
 So many rides up on the curb my lil 'cause thought the fair was here 
 Like oh, I'm primo, top spot redeemed ho, for who? My team 
 And we might take a trip to Jamaica, Montego, pussy and flamingos 
 Got me thinking the fuck I need to sleep for? 
 I woke up working like a Mexican 
 That mean I work from 10 to 10 
 Then 10 to 10, then 10 again 
 Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline
