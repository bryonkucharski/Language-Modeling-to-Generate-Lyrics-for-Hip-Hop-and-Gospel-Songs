Big Sean: 
 I don't give a fuck about anything, that you're telling me 
 Cause right now it's all, irrelevant 
 I'm so high I won't, remember it 
 And I wish that this could last forever 
 But maybe one night is even better 
 Real nigga mayne 
 All the people plotted with 
 Is the same ones I'm dividin' the profits with 
 Now I'm in the building like two planes bitch 
 Kickin' it with my shirt off, on some liu kang shit 
 Sleep with the sun up like I grew fangs bitch 
 I come alive in the night, on some bruce wayne shit 
 Livin' my life, gettin' high payments 
 Fuckin' with some new broads and they high maintenance 
 And they wearin' high heels, trip so we're high heels 
 Tipsy and high, rollin' zips, gettin' high man errthang' high

 Cause right now it's all, irrelevant 
 I'm so high I won't, remember it 
 Cause' the penthouse 90 floors up 
 Make love andthen join the mile high club 
 Yeah I'm on camera, fresh out of a sex scene 
 I just turn all my nightmares into wet dreams 
 I'm in a new crib, so big, I'm talkin' town size 
 Sippin' somethin' cold, smokin' weed by the pound size 
 Yeah I gotta big head ho, I think it's crown size 
 Bitch I do it big, and I never plan to down size 
 People who talk shit, is feelin' like dickheads 
 Saw me on the web like I had a extra six legs 
 Lookin' at my highlights 
 With a bitch with highlights 
 Crowd wavin' at me, all tryna' say hi right 
 Everything high

 Oh you sayin' you don't smoke?

 Oh, don't gotta ask me if I burn enough cause' we don't run out 
 Blow it by the o, even my fans smoke it 
 Cause' they throw it at my shows 
 Hidin' it when I travel in case the police gotta know 
 Rollin' it up in traffic 
 Make you smoke out of a bong, put you on different hashes 
 My chick is the baddest, my spliff is the fattest

 Truthfully I want this shit to last a lifetime 
 Simply amazing, we blazin' while we just right rhymes 
 Cold flow, ice time, breakin' down bright pines 
 Enough with all the beefin' I'm over it 
 Outta town kush, but they smokin' that local shit

 They ride the greyhound, but I'm more a peter pan, we the fam 
 Off the scale, yeah we about to break the richter quick 
 Loud years, work a thousand words we should picture shit 
 When I come to smokin' we have a certificate
