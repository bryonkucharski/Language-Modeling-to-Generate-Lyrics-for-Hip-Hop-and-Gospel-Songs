Now I be fuckin' with these bitches like they hypo-allergenic 
 Women are from Venus, caught in love playing Tennis 
 Some girls are the Lebron James of playing mind games 
 And switch their home team up every single time their mind change 
 Don't play no games with hoes, I play Nintendo DS, nigga 
 And pray I don't see the ends of my paper like P.S nigga 
 But damn in high school you had the fattest ass 
 And now me out of high school, you got a fatter ass 
 Swear I was just up on your Instagram a day or two ago 
 Seen your ass in deja vu, that shit was deja vu I know 
 Reminiscing on the one time we smashed in the back of the whip 
 And you gave me that head 
 I swear to God that was the best night of my life 
 I can't even sit here frontin', lying, pretend 
 Dancing with your titties out 
 I know at first it was a little bit embarrassing yeah 
 But 5 minutes later you on my lap 
 And we just kickin' it like we're the only ones here 
 You're telling me how you went down South for school 
 Down near TSU 
 But you know business majors 
 You can't even get a job when you're comin' right out of the school 
 Told her check the valley, seems like out there they be hiring 
 In L.A where all the girls that look like you are aspiring 
 A new scenery might just be inspiring 
 She said "Pshh, man everything ain't for everybody, shit I'm good" 
 Okay I came up how I came up 
 A little change bring change up 
 A little fame bring famous 
 A little danger now I'm dangerous 
 Gettin' high now I'm the supply now 
 Laying low cause it won't fade us 
 Deliver how I deliver cause nigga I need to 
 Still feel like I deserve it 
 How I feel like I deserve it 
 Still feel like I deserve it 
 How I feel like I deserve it 
 Now I be fuckin' with these bitches like they hypo-allergenic 
 Women are from Venus, caught in love playing Tennis 
 Some hoes are the Lebron James of playing mind games 
 And switch their home team up every single time their mind change 
 She drop it for me, pussy pop it for me, take it to the top 
 Spending extra money when she ain't got it, on me 
 The she turned around said 
 "I'm so proud, seems like every where I'm hearin' ya 
 Seems like yesterday you freestyled in the cafeteria 
 Tell me how it happened? Know this ain't the place to ask" 
 When she said that shit I had a flashback, back to the past 
 Man '07, LAX, first time in the baggage claim 
 Don C picked me up off the curb, my bags in hand 
 Was nervous as shit, knew I was meeting up with Ye 
 And we riding through the hills swerve, swervin' and shit 
 Seeing the houses on the hills like I'm deserving this shit 
 Oh boy I'm worth it yeah it's time to put the work in this shit 
 Oh that was back before I had the G.O.O.D. imprint 
 Hit the studio with Kanye, that shit was intense 
 And he said "Boy you got it, boy you is a prophet" 
 Sign me, got a profit 
 Few years later yeah we on here poppin' 
 And I got a crib off in the same hills we used to drive in 
 Brr Brr, call up Don C he was the first to know about it 
 Almost went to TSU with Alesha then I dropped it 
 Fuck it, I guess everything ain't for everybody 
 Oh boy, swerve 
 Okay I came up how I came up 
 A little change bring change up 
 A little fame bring famous 
 A little danger now I'm dangerous 
 Gettin' high now I'm the supply now 
 Laying low cause it won't fade us 
 Deliver how I deliver cause nigga I need to 
 Still feel like I deserve it 
 How I feel like I deserve it 
 Still feel like I deserve it 
 How I feel like I deserve it
