Yup, yup 
 I look up 
 'Cause I can't look down on you bitch niggas no mo, man 
 If that casket ain't 24 karat gold when I die 
 Then I ain't made enough fucking money man and that's real talk 
 God 
 This my roll weed time 
 Don't turn it into dead in the street time 
 Her legs do the peace sign 
 Know the hood so well don't need street signs 
 Young rich and iconic 
 Big titties I'm signin' 
 Burnin' benjies and chronic 
 Big white smoke clouds every time I talk, does it look like I'm in a comic? 
 Everything I rock I designed it, realer nigga, won't find it 
 Okay, I be stackin' that cheddar, bet that shit won't expire 
 Got me ballin' so hard, I need me Jerry Maguire 
 I made a mil before twenty-five, man and I ain't even no lie 
 Bitch I ain't sayin' that shit to brag neither, I'm sayin' that to inspire 
 I'm like, damn boy, fuck you sayin' boy? 
 Hatin' on me, knowin' that you is a fan boy 
 When I'm around you call me 'Cause like we fam boy? 
 Rappin' like me let's me know that I'm the man boy 
 Okay, Hennessy and Bombay is a real nigga entree 
 I gave her my grande, my food is picante 
 My girls is Beyonce, your boyfriend beyond gay 
 I seen him hang with Deandre and they was lookin' like prom dates 
 One time for my hood till I go in the ground 
 I'm throwin' it up 'cause they holdin' me down 
 I'm perverted as fuck, got a pole in the house 
 Got your girl and your girl and they hoein' it out 
 But you standin' outside cause no hoes is allowed 
 If you work like I work, you would throw in the towel 
 Once you get in this life, man, there's no comin' out 
 And haters look at me like snow in the south 
 Surprise nigga 
 Man fuck it, I'm on, you off and I hope you die nigga 
 Why you alive nigga? 
 I'm stackin' dough cause my momma addicted to spas 
 Yeah I'm the one that these hatin' niggas despise 
 You better take off your fuckin' disguise, nigga 
 Bitch-made is in your eyes nigga 
 Lies nigga 
 Shut the fuck up, everything'll be fine 
 'Cause this my roll weed time
