Hella cheese, hella trees, LSD 
 Selling D, feeling like the 70s 
 Getting paid like we seventy 
 Float around my town like it's the motherfucking seven seas 
 Hit the club, lose seven Gs, film it all on 7D's 
 Spilling liquor rest in peace, rest in my G's, rest with her P 
 Start the day dissecting weed, then strategize then rest my team 
 Same show, different seats, same game, different league 
 Living life I hope that everyone I love will get to see, 
 Get to see, get to see, get to see, get to see 
 Living life I hope that everyone I love will get to see, 
 Get to see, get to see, get to see, get to see 
 Bitch 
 I was thinking about the ice that I put on, money that I've blown 
 Bitches that I know, everything that I've done wrong 
 All the licks I hit, all the bullets missed 
 Got my shit legit, a lot of people pissed, well 
 I got money coming through 
 Drugs and women coming too 
 Got my family living comfortable 
 Got me thinking I'm doing what I'm supposed to do 
 I'm doing what I'm supposed to do 
 I'm doing what I'm supposed to do 
 Hella cheese, hella trees, LSD 
 Selling D, feeling like the 70s 
 Getting paid like we seventy 
 Use to roll around in that Toyota rolling seven deep, damn 
 Bitch
