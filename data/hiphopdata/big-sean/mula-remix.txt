 Ain't nothing more important than the mula

 Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise God, hallelujah 
 Ain't nothing more important than the mula 
 I'm with my shooter and a preacher hallelujah 
 When they view ya fucking around 
 Me and my niggas we come in your town 
 Busting them bottles and fucking your bitches 
 And when they start hating we gunning them niggas 
 Don't fuck 'em around, boy I get money all day 
 And I ball hard like Tim Hardaway 
 I can see a bad bitch from far away 
 Let her ride this dick 'cause I had a hard day 
 And my dick even harder, you whippin' the charges 
 You put your rims on and you think that you're balling 
 I'm whippin' a Bentley, I can't even cut it 
 And my shit so retarded I handicap parking like SKRRRRRR!

 Condom on 'fo I go to work, that's my uniform. 
 Nigga I used to eat mayonnaise sandwiches 
 By candle lit, and that's cause the power's out 
 And not for romance and shit (No!) 
 From barely managing to mansions 
 Where ho's call me Mr. Anderson 
 Command a bitch, no I don't own the pussy I just sample it 
 I got a couple marbles missing I know 
 Now there's marbles all on the floor 
 On the bathroom, kitchen and stove 
 I got bitches on my cellular callin and confessing 
 But I don't reply cause that's the clearest way to send a message 
 Paper running through my jugular 
 I'm blowing loud, throwing thous, getting drunk 
 You know my style 
 And my momma say she still proud, that's mula 
 Ain't nothing more important than the mula 
 Ain't nothing more important than the mula 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise God, hallelujah 
 I'm winning, I don't owe nann nigga shit 
 Came in this motherfucker by myself 
 Smoking on strong, and holding on my dick like Ah 
 My gold on, I'm the bomb, I'm talking goldmine 
 Nigga's taking shots at me, I send em' back to their homeline 
 And I touchdown, goalline, y'all ain't killing shit

 Me and Nells on a milerun, uh, shawty gonna need her drawers done 
 Eat her pussy till it's all gone, uh 
 And I still ain't ever been robbed, so nigga don't try me 
 Two niggas with guns, natural wallet 
 That pickpocket want my I.D and I spray your zone 
 Treat niggas like strippers and put cash on em' 
 Got a new chomp, I need that bitch that want a tag on 
 If you shoot me, you famous, if I shoot you, I'm brainless 
 So I'm about to be, dumb as fuck, cause' I got blessed fools and babies 
 When I was fifteen I was felon, 
 When you were fifteen you were yelling 
 Mama come get this nigga off my fucking melon 
 Ain't nothing more important than the mula

 Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise God, hallelujah 
 Scared money never gon' make nothin', (that's right) 
 Gotta get it my medula 
 Couple dollars in the waist band, (that's right) 
 Nigga hula-hoop with the mula 
 Everyday that I wake I say grace 
 Hallelujah welcome back like Mase 
 Bitches only fuck niggas with the cream 
 A nigga this fresh ain't never gon' date 
 Ay, they say we can't maintain 
 Only real niggas remain 
 'Ye say that we the new slaves 
 I need to ball with a chain 
 I got a real bad bitch I haven't seen her in a month 
 With twins so big she can put it in her ugh 
 Ooh I love it when she drop it and spread it like 
 When I see her camel all I wanna do hump 
 Okay the Hall of Fame keep callin' my name 
 Got a mural on the wall I'mma legend 
 From the motor city and been have drive 
 I just need a little gas in my engine 
 Okay, we all in the game we ballin' the same 
 Home team nigga that's a blessing

 So good it can get my into heaven, nigga
