I done fell asleep fucking last night 
 That's how much I don't sleep nigga 
 Finally famous nigga 
 And I'll be goddamned if I didn't 
 Put the city on let's get it 
 (All right all right all right, all right all right all right) 
 Let's get it 
 And I'll be goddamned if I didn't 
 Put the city on let's get it 
 (All right all right all right, all right all right all right) 
 Let's get it 
 Today is a good day 
 I wish a nigga would day 
 Ride through the hood day 
 Ride through the hood where I would stay 
 If I wasn't me, wasn't committed 
 I told my mom and my dad it'll be the last Christmas 
 In the hood that you can visit 
 Oh boy I got it, no chasers 
 Cause the best mixed with Hennessey is problems 
 I took that advice young when I was headed up to college 
 Momma swimming in that debt 
 Rather swim with the piranhas or the shark 
 Ready set go, on your mark to the top 
 Getting rich ain't a blessing it's a choice 
 Drunk and still drinking out the bottle 
 I want a hood rat bitch motherfuck a model 
 You ain't alive if you ain't living that's the motto 
 And imma' probably wake up tomorrow sayin', sayin' 
 And I'll be goddamned if I didn't 
 Put the city on let's get it 
 (All right all right all right, all right all right all right) 
 Let's get it 
 Let's get it, yeah be all right nigga 
 It's the motherfucking world nigga 
 Getcha some time to just do it how I done it 
 First up on the first cause' first of all you gotta want it 
 Re-up time for every penny, never fronted 
 So room for, paid every penny then I stunted 
 Stunted so hard you woulda thought I was a stuntman 
 TS4 with 23's I'm talking jumpmans 
 Twos and thirds watch for the blitz, you know they rush 
 Just don't get caught in the coupe with them birds, end of discussion 
 Them boys round the corner wanna sell in that Cal Ripken 
 If them niggas think I'm riding with that, them niggas tripping 
 Yeah I got a magnificent hustle, cause' imma' grinder 
 Told my olds I'm hiding you here, so they won't find you 
 What you know about a bag that's heavy as anacondas? 
 Bet you one thing, I ain't talking no marijuana 
 That's what's wrong with these niggas they think it's about shine 
 You niggas get back to your grind, I think it's about time 
 And I'll be goddamned if I didn't 
 Put the city on let's get it 
 (All right all right all right, all right all right all right) 
 Let's get it 
 They say it's my time according to my Rolex 
 I'm bout to fuck the game, then your ho next 
 I used to talk dirty on my cell, no phone sex 
 No yoga boy I was making blow stretch 
 Press the fast forward button, I'm pushing a foreign something 
 All through my neighborhood, next stop is the haters hood 
 My bitch so bad, but you can bet that my paper good 
 I do this for real, you lil niggas just fake it good 
 It's time for a new crib, it's time for a new chain 
 20 thousand on me homie that's just loose change 
 Too many diamond chains that nigga a mess 
 But if you knew bout my hood you'd say that nigga is blessed 
 Detroit in this bitch, Big Sean what it do bro? 
 Getting money four ways so I can buy a two-door 
 Stash looking healthy but my jewelry got the flu though 
 The hustle's who I represent, dope boys we in this bitch 
 And I'll be goddamned if I didn't 
 Put the city on let's get it 
 (All right all right all right, all right all right all right) 
 Let's get it 
 Detroit, once the backbone of this country 
 Now it's the largest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy 
 Thriving neighborhoods are now vacant 
 Going from a population of nearly 2 million 
 To under 700,000 in a matter of years 
 The people of Detroit really going to have to stick together, 
 To make it through these tough times
