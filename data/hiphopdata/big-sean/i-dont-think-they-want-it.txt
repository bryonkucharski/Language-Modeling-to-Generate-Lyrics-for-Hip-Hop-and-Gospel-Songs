I Don't Think They Want It 
 I-I Don't think they want it 
 I Don't Think They Want It 
 I-I Don't think they want it 
 Soon as I walk in all the bad bitches on it 
 I saw you perform yeah, you put on a light show 
 I walk up in this bitch looking like a light show 
 Got a team but I'm by myself ISO 
 Killing sh-t lights on, lights on, lights off 
 On my job bitch, no nights off 
 And on my nights off, it still might cost 
 I Don't Think They Want It 
 I-I Don't think they want it 
 Your girls on my dick and she trying to sit up on it 
 She hopped on my lap even took a pick up on it 
 And I passed her to my n-ggas 'cause I don't really want it 
 I Don't Think They Want It 
 I-I Don't think they want it 
 Brand new whip but I push it like it's stolen 
 7-11 a n-gga keep rollin' 
 I'm headed to the top bitch and I don't think you going 
 And how my checks look, stupid as hell 
 So tell me how my ex look, stupid as hell 
 I Don't Think They Want It 
 I-I Don't think they want it 
 I Don't Think They Want It 
 I-I Don't think they want it 
 Ay, now every time I stepped in 
 You could tell I stepped out 
 I saw your girlfriend only from the chest down 
 I'm so dressed up but I pull her dress down 
 By the time she wake up, I'm in the next town 
 I Don't Think They Want It 
 I-I Don't think they want it 
 I met your main bitch and I put my n-ggas on it 
 And she bust it wide open, hotel picture phoning 
 Send it all around the World so I don't even want it 
 2, 3 I'm in my zone bitch 
 Where's the competition? 
 I need a clone bitch 
 I Don't Think They Want It 
 I-I Don't think they want it 
 And I run GOOD music n-gga Usain Bolt'n 
 Getting music so the drinks the only thing that's pouring 
 Damn that's what I like and it feel good 
 And it look right, tell her keep going 
 I Don't Think They Want It 
 I-I Don't think they want it 
 I Don't Think They Want It 
 I-I Don't think they want it 
 What you got? nothing! 
 What I got? everything! 
 You was straight gassin, I put that on kerosine 
 I just give her dick dog, you give her a wedding ring 
 You need her at the alter now that is just embarrassing 
 Let 'em talk sh-t though, go ahead, carry on 
 I just walk up in this bitch higher than a carry on 
 Flyer than a carry on, sipping on Perignon 
 Gripping on derriere, gripping off Derrion 
 Somebody show these weak n-ggas where the exit is 
 'Cause they always trying to be where my section is 
 Ay for real though, the number one question is: 
 Why is your girlfriend always where the sexing is? 
 I Don't Think They Want It 
 I-I Don't think they want it 
 I Don't Think They Want It 
 I-I Don't think they want it
