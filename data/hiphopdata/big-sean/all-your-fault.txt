 People sayin' I'm the closest thing to Mike since Janet, whoo 
 Tom Cruise, homie, we jumpin' up on them couches 
 That's a fresh house, is that a guest house 
 Your house got another house 
 Your bitch got a bitch, your spouse got another spouse 
 Young Walt Disney, I'ma tell you truthfully 
 If you leave Mickey you gon' end up with a Goofy 
 I imagine that's what Chris told Karrueche 
 Girls be actin' like it's diamonds in they coochie 
 I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck

 We finna have to protest and tear the city up

 Ho we done made it through hell and disaster 
 My crib done got bigger, my women got badder 
 You wonderin' how do you get in the game 
 I'm wonderin' how do I get to the rafters 
 Oh boy, I'm mad until these records gettin' shattered 
 Till I'm MJ or Magic, oh she just want the status, so 
 You the man she got, but I'm the man she been after 
 She done sent so many naked pics my phone ain't got no data 
 I walk off in New York like my name Derek Jeter 
 Headed home to the D where you know I keep a Gina 
 I'm the good with the evil 
 Fuck you nice to meet you 
 You can have a peace sign man without the middle finger 
 With the clique when you see us, that's my family to me 
 That's my family tree 
 They're my arms, legs, hands, and my feet 
 And I can't cut them off even with diabetes 
 Hit the beat and kerosene it 
 Scratch that, I white sheet it 
 A 100 dollar fade every single time you see us 
 Been a king all my life so I shoulda got a Caesar 
 Somewhere off in Vegas rollin' dice up at the Caesar's 
 Got me thinkin' back bout how I used to roll to Little Caesar's 
 Piece of pizza with Tanisha 
 Now I'm with a Boniqua 
 She finna blow at that 
 I got your dream girl, yeah she actin' like a ho at that 
 Throw her to me I'ma throw that back 
 Top spot I'm finna go at that

 Nobody, nobody, nobody, but me 
 Ho you gotta move quick 
 (World in my hands, I ain't gotta loose grip 
 I don't like loose pussy or loose lips) 
 And I done did the impossible a few times, Tom Cruise shit 
 Ho and I ain't satisfied bein' on that top 5 list 
 (I ain't satisfied until I'm on that all-time list) 
 Till everything I spit is all timeless 
 (My girl on that all fine list) 
 My life a little luck, a lot of grind 
 Bitch no maybe ho I gotta make it 
 (Fuck your nomination man fuck the world) 
 I'm repopulatin', wrap my rollie round my waist yeah time's a waistin' 
 (Niggas want the comma, comma combination) 
 Long as I'm around, it's gon' be dot dot dot a lot of waitin' 
 Got my pinky on her brain while I'm gettin' brain plottin' world domination 
 (People ask me how I done make it) 
 I'm just like "man if you want the crown, bitch you gotta take it" 
 Straight up
