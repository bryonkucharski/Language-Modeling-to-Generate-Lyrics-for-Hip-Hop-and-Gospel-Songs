G.O.O.D Music in this bitch 
 Man I was up early in the A.M., legs will be achin' 
 Feet will be achin' from dreams I was chasin' 
 Was always told "you won't see nathan just waitin'" 
 Like them hatin' ass niggas that just sit around hatin' 
 Pussy ass niggas they shoud sit around thinkin' 
 Walk around in aprons bitchin' and bakin' 
 I'm sayin' my city like "we need another hero" 
 I'm tired of playin' the background like Tito 
 Jackass niggas, remind me of Steve-o 
 I put 'em in their place so I remind them of debo 
 Ay did you see that award show where I got my close up? It's all good I got it on Tivo 
 'Ye called me and my mama said "I think its time to sign" 
 Got signed 'round the time Common said "its for the people" 
 I'm tryna make it better for mines without a kilo 
 Made it out the D, boy and he ain't a d-boy 
 No, and he ain't a d-boy 
 Man these other niggas decoys 
 Now mama I done grown up too much for you to try to have me babied 
 And lately, I realized that I was (?) 
 We eatin' bout to have a perfect season I'll be damned if I get Randy Moss and Tom Brady-ed 
 I made a little change I can't truly complain 
 Datin' with a chick that got beauty and brains 
 But when them bitches come around talkin' bout sex, she gone say that I'm a dog, well all dogs go to heaven 
 My grandma used to talk about how college was so needed 
 Signed for a half a mill, now she like "who need a degree?" 
 At our family gatherings like "who need a CD?" 
 Everybody hands out like I said "who need a freebie?" 
 Man what's up? label said "he next up" 
 People said "he next up" man let's get it pressed up 
 I'm glad I never listened to y'all and let up 
 Stuck to my roots, call me Questlove 
 Call the radio and they gonna request us 
 So I'm headed to the bank 'cause I'm finna check up 
 Ha ha ha, ha ha ha, (?) blase blah I'll prolly buy that tomorrow 
 For real, I'll prolly buy that tomorrow 
 Naw for real, I'll prolly buy that tomorrow 
 Nigga you ain't know?
