Take me away, way, way, way, way, way, way. 
 Take me away, way, way, way, way.

 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 blunts passed off 
 Pick your planet, roll it, toke it, smoke it, then we blast off 
 I'll probably be on mars when I light up 
 Clean up, then head down to Venus to get wifed up 
 The nigga in me wanna go to Pluto to get (iced up) 
 Race through space 
 Damn these colors vibrant 
 I'm going on a trip without the luggage 
 But there's baggage 'cause I bagged it 
 If the police see I have it 
 Flash the badge and they'll try to 
 Take me away, way, way, way, way, way, way. 
 Take me away, way, way, way, way.

 Green, yellow, orange, brown, red and that purp purp 
 Got me on my Final Frontier like Captain Kirk Kirk 
 Not to be on my ball sack 
 But, this isn't Star Trek 
 So puff the magic dragon and hop on my flying carpet 
 Preacher told me I should listen to more Mary Mary 
 But, I love Mary so much Imma probably marry Mary 
 Mary J. naw 
 Mary Jane like Peter Parker spot a maid 
 And I hope she feel the same 
 Take me away, way, way, way, way, way, way. 
 Take me away, way, way, way, way.

 Zoomin' the reason that I'm cruisin' 
 It's 'cause I'm steady waitin' to exhale 
 Blowin' on that Whitney Houston 
 She get me so emotional, delirious 
 If I hit more than a few times I'm tearin' up 
 And when life tear me up, god damnit it tear me up 
 She can be my mascot, always there to cheer me up 
 Oh my God I'm goin' I'm goin' I'm gone 
 Call me on my phone nah my nigga I'm zoned out 
 Take me away, way, way, way, way, way, way. 
 Take me away, way, way, way, way.

 Pick it, pick it, roll it (x4) 
 Then we blast off 
 Pick it, pick it, roll it (x4)
