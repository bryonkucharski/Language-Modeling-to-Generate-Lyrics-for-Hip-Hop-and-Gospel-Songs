Big Sean: 
 Uh-huh, oh, yeah, look 
 Okay I know what it feel like to be young and single 
 You know the life when your pockets got a bunch of singles 
 You know taking double shots, saying fuck a single 
 You know, hardly getting sleep but it's the fuckin' dream though 
 Look, I know what it feel like to think you found the one 
 Told mom that so many times that I'm sounding dumb 
 'Cause she started to mix Ashley up with Tanesha 
 And saying "Hi Britney" when I'm on the phone with Lisa 
 Fuck it, I got some new hoes, I mean some XXX girls 
 Pussy get wet as an S-Curl 
 Then I started thinkin' 'bout my ex-ex-ex girl 
 And how it was the worst times but she was the best girl 
 You know, good girl, bad time, right place, wrong mind 
 Got my mind right, hit her back, brrr, the wrong line 
 (The number you dialed has been disconnected) 
 Man, but before I started feeling bad 
 My nigga text me like "I got some hoes, hit me back" 
 Fuck it 
 Jeremih: 
 Oh I could let you down 
 When you trip, I'll take you anywhere, I take ya 
 We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right 
 You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side 
 With this crazy, crazy world 
 Thank God I'm with my girl 
 We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right 
 You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side 
 With this crazy, crazy world 
 Thank God I'm with my girl 
 Chance the Rapper: 
 You be the momma, you be the daddy 
 Baby we could play house, I'll change your addy 
 Or even change my palate and fuck with salad 
 Put me in the picture, let's change your avi, oh, oh, oh 
 Can't even stunt I was sprung from the jump 
 Never got head while flaming up the blunt 
 You were my first, I'm just saying 
 More folks should try it, it's crazy 
 Focus, selfish moments, on road, I don't have my share 
 Flying out of town like baby don't mind my player 
 Sleepy arguments via texts while I buy my beer 
 And the air so tired I forget to recline my chair 
 Picture you in my head, a souvenir by my legs 
 Some scuba gear for the bed, we do it cause simon says 
 Ain't a single living thing that likes living single 
 We good over here, that's all that we know 
 Jeremih: 
 Oh I could let you down 
 When you trip, I'll take you anywhere, I take ya 
 We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right 
 You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side 
 With this crazy, crazy world 
 Thank God I'm with my girl 
 We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right 
 You know it right if she ain't by my side 
 With this crazy, crazy world 
 Thank God I'm with my girl 
 Big Sean: 
 To the one girl guys who claim they don't need more 
 Like my nigga Henry, he married at 24 
 I'm like why nigga, why? 
 You supposed to be with her longer than your ass been alive? 
 He like "ah" 
 Fuck it, we about to do therapy 
 Aye, at least when I hit the doctor I'm care free with no plan b's 
 You probably never got tested and have that type of clarity 
 I'd rather live my life with that lifetime guarantee 
 But I'm down to hear the stories about what your hoes do 
 It's probably more entertaining than me talking about my wife down in Whole Foods 
 Or how I'm with her I feel whole too 
 Go ahead, keep living that life you niggas know you too old too 
 Fuck it, I started laughing and pretend like I ain't listen 
 Even though he's on target with everything I've been missing 
 The closest thing I had to that came in at 4AM and out at 8 for work 
 And I'm the reason we ain't make it work 
 That's what makes it worse 
 Jeremih: 
 Oh I could let you down 
 When you trip, I'll take you anywhere, I take ya 
 We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right 
 You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side 
 With this crazy, crazy world 
 Thank God I'm with my girl 
 We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right 
 You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side 
 With this crazy, crazy world 
 Thank God I'm with my girl
