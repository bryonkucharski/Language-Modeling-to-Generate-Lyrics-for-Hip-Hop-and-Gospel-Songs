Man, fuck y'all with a sick dick, semi automatic no click click 
 We don't feel you like an elephant, gettin' fucked with a tick dick 
 Little nigga with a thick bitch, and before I fuck this bitch

 Trukfit, t-shirt, talk second, skeet first

 She give me brain, research, and I prefer, reefer 
 But if you want some coke, that's cool, cause my homies still
