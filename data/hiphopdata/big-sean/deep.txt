Do or die nigga 
 I'mma keep poppin' this champagne 
 You ain't pop shit 
 Man I look up to god 
 I wonder if I fell from the sky 
 Will I hit the ground or will I learn how to fly 
 I'm pretty sure you see it in my eyes 
 Sometimes I wonder if I already died 
 That shit get deep, deep, deep 
 Man I swear to god that shit just get so deep, deep, deep, deep 
 Man I swear to god it get so deep though 
 That sometimes I just gotta wake my ass up out my sleep though 
 And wonder what if all the shit I reaped then got repoed 
 And the girl I gave it all up for ain't love me for me though 
 See I got a stack of problems that could use a fucking steamroll 
 Got off in the game don't need no cheat code 
 As long as I know the G code 
 Being paranoid ain't turn me to a creep 
 You ain't got that metal on your side 
 Police gon' work it like Magneto if they need to, it get deep 
 Deep, deeper than telekinesis 
 Deeper than your sister dying and you're telling your nieces 
 The deeper it gets, boy the pressure increases 
 But pressure make diamonds 
 And my name is Sean 'cause I shine, it's self explanatory 
 I architect the flow, rapping all of these stories on stories 
 You know the story 
 If my back against the ropes, then I'll finish don't call it 
 My opponent probably praying for postponement 
 You fuck with the best rapper don't even know it 
 It's written in the stars man the sky is the author 
 I pulled the sword out of the stone I'm King Arthur 
 Motherfuck your armor nigga, only weapon I'm scared of is Karma 
 You watching the son turn to father, fucking life and her daughter 
 Nigga that shit just get deep 
 Man I look up to god 
 I wonder if I fell from the sky 
 Will I hit the ground or will I learn how to fly 
 I'm pretty sure you see it in my eyes 
 Sometimes I wonder if I already died 
 That shit get deep, deep, deep 
 Man I swear to god that shit just get so deep, deep, deep, deep 
 Been going hard all day, wish a nigga would fuck with me 
 Then I blow the candles out on my K 
 And niggas always thinking it's a game, 'til we ran them out the arcade 
 Stunting in my southern player, reach the caddy like Andre 
 I talk that cash money shit 
 YM plus CMB you can do the math for me bitch 
 Jail time a slap on the wrist 
 Cut your head off get it mailed out stamp on your lips 
 You can tell I'm grinding by my wrist 
 Anything can happen 'cause a broke man is an optimist 
 Well tell them I'll be waiting in suspense 
 I got some miles on me but it's cool 'cause I never get an inch 
 And I don't give two fucks about what your mouth say 
 'Cause shit is deep and in rap I cannot say 
 That shit enough times like somebody rewind me 
 Like shit is deeper than rap, I cannot say that shit enough times 
 I feel like Sean, don't get enough shine 
 Is it because he ain't got the tattoos, he ain't throwing up signs 
 Well let me throw up mine and also let me show this vision of mine 
 Fuck the finish line, just finish in lines 
 And if getting your point across crosses the line 
 Some of the time, then cross it with pride 
 That's real my nigga, remember that 
 And ain't nobody if they remember you they remember rap 
 So just spit it back and hope somebody diggin' that 
 'Cause this shit is deep, deep 
 Deep as empty pockets, nigga 
 We come empty pockets before we have empty pockets slime 
 That shit get deep 
 Man I look up to god 
 I wonder if I fell from the sky 
 Will I hit the ground or will I learn how to fly 
 I'm pretty sure you see it in my eyes 
 Sometimes I wonder if I already died 
 That shit get deep, deep, deep 
 Man I swear to god that shit just get so deep, deep, deep, deep
