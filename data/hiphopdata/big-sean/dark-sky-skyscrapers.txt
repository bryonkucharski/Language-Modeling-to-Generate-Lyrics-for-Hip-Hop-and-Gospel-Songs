I see the skyscrapers in the back, this shit is official 
 I got a lot on my mind, I got more in my face 
 If I ain't going to get it, that day is going to waste 
 I'm tryna move in my safe, like the safe was a safehouse 
 I ain't going out to eat, but these hoes stay on the stakeout 
 And you know it's official when I go bringing that BAPE out 
 I'm thumbing through the magazines like "this the girl I'mma take out" 
 Imagine stuck in the D and you tryna find a way way out 
 And yeah, your music been bumping and you just waiting to break out 
 And I've been waiting all god damn year, all year 
 I can tell that it's near, but near ain't here 
 Man, them bills is here right now 
 I guess you shine brightest when the lights down, like now 
 And then they say it happened for me overnight, shit, yeah I guess 
 I guess it took ten years for me to be an overnight success 
 What you know about living check to check to living check to check to check to check? 
 First place, no neck and neck 
 Two girls is breast to breast to breast to breast 
 Blowing smoke but I'm a breath of fresh air 
 Yeah, saying I'm doing extra numbers like I'm Chinese 
 Taking double shots like Siamese 
 I'm from where crime breeds, her titties out like sign these 
 I knew I lived this life back when I was young and used to climb trees 
 I should've known back then I wasn't gonna stop 
 'Cause even then I was infatuated with just sitting at the top 
 I said I should've known back then, man, that I wasn't gonna stop 
 'Cause even then I was infatuated with just sitting at the top 
 And I don't owe nobody in the world no favors 
 I started from the basement, made it to the skyscrapers 
 I'm a successful nigga, I got shit going on 
 I'm a successful Don, I got shit going on 
 Bitch, watch how you speak to me 
 I've been working all week and I know I need ZZZZs 
 Tryna get paid repeatedly 
 Jamaica or Cancun, oh now that's where I need to be 
 Credit card used to be EBT, in the D though that's D-EBT 
 I be thinking about becoming a cop 
 So I can murder some niggas one by one off legally 
 I talk that real shit, but that's why they loving it 
 One time for the city, treating it like it's the mothership 
 Was talking to my dad though on some other shit 
 He like "man, slow down with the girls you're fucking with 
 If they ain't a quarter back, there's no point of rushing it 
 Don't make the same mistakes I made with your mother" 
 But that's on some other shit, look 
 I'm into risk and taking it 
 I'm into making it then back then make it like I ain't made it yet 
 This the rehab for a workaholic, I been thinking bout shaking it 
 I done had a Rolex longer than I had relationships, I'm embarrassed to say that shit 
 But I've been working on myself and that's the most important work 
 Even if you don't get paid for it 
 Shit, call me the greatest 
 Don't call up no favours, I call up my saviour 
 Like thank you God, look at all we created 
 I started rapping Biggie Smalls in the basement 
 And now we headed to the tallest skyscrapers
