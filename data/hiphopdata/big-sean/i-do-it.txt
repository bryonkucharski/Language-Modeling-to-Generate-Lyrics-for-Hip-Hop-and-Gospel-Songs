I do it 
 I do it 
 I do it 
 Boi... 
 I waited my whole life to be the man of the hour 
 Really can't lie, I was the man when I started 
 I will be the man when I die 
 Man these hoes, take your money 
 And I take their virginity 
 I'm high, I split an O in half, now it's a parenthesis 
 Crazier than crazy, ape shit, retardedly stupid 
 I put that weed in an uh and pass it 
 Yep that's ally oopin, okay 
 Oh, that's your girl 
 Well I don't give a master two shits 
 Okay I'm westside, westside till I'm riding underneath them tulips 
 You bordo like Enrique, I'm toupee, I'm three-pee 
 I'm looking like I'mma sweep stakes 
 But I treat ya girl like a cheap skate 
 'Cause I need a crib, a big estate 
 I need a boat and that need a lake 
 I need some salmon, that need a plate 
 That need a chef so I feed my safe 
 My crew is who I'd be widdy-be-wid-it 
 Rose I sippity-sip-it 
 I'm Quagmire I fuck hoes 
 My cashflow I giggity-giggity it 
 Boy, I'm cock-a-mania 
 The most zaniest, insaniant 
 Pulling up in Merced-iance 
 Rolling up like I'm Damian 
 I love girls that Arabian, Albanian, caucasian 
 I ride around gettin' cranium cause my dick is hard as titanium 
 Oh boy you had your chance, and blew it (you blew it) 
 Stand aside and watch a real nigga do it 
 I feel like the World mine 
 Just bow down, the World mine 
 I'mma let you live, the World mine 
 This World mine 
 The one and only in this muthafucker 
 Niggas staring like we the only ones in this muthafucker 
 How could you not know we in this muthafucker 
 I got my haters looking lonely in this muthafucker 
 Whoa, I'm sipping on whatever I get handed 
 Throwing house parties so crazy that my crib look like a campus 
 Play your cards right and I could blow you up 
 Nah, I ain't Gambit shit, I'm wasted, wasted 
 This looks like a job for Captain Planet 
 Nah, nah, good lordy, wowdy, I just took more shot than Kobe 
 The realest niggas is reppin 
 The baddest bitches promoting 
 She put that thong on my groin groin 
 And then it go boing! 
 Got my fronter on her bumper does it look like she towing 
 I hustle hard like I'm finna lose the crib 
 And party hard like I'm finna do it big 
 All I ever do is big 
 So all she wanna do is big 
 Girl, what your name is, I really can't remember 
 And tone breaking tree down, somebody yell out timber 
 I'm up up in them Kush clouds, lighting up like I'm Zeus 
 Bitch stand back watch how a real nigga do it 
 I feel like the World mine 
 Just bow down, the World mine 
 I'mma let you live, the World mine 
 This World mine
