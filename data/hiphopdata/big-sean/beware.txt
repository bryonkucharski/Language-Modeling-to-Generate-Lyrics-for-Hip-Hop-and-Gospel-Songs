When you said it was over 
 You shot right through my heart 
 Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart 
 Ooh, I was so mad 
 I should've seen this coming right from the start 
 You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart 
 Praying to a sky all black 
 Looking at the stars like they finna talk back 
 Looking at my phone like she finna call back 
 But last night I feel like probably ended all that 
 Cause by now she woulda sent a text in all caps 
 Then another one tryna take all back 
 Saying fuck you, I miss you or I hate you so much 
 Cause girls only say "hate you" to the guys they love 
 I know, I know, I know 
 The highs, the lows it comes and goes 
 You say "be real" I try, I don't 
 Cause you take anything and just make it everything 
 Kept my phone on silent ever since you got a ring (funny right?) 
 And I never cheated (I mean, maybe once, twice) 
 One time don't change everything 
 She ask why I don't feel the same, I'm still the same 
 She's still insane and now she's saying 
 When you said it was over 
 You shot right through my heart 
 Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart 
 Ooh, I was so mad 
 I should've seen this coming right from the start 
 You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart 
 Okay, skeet, smoke 
 Sleep, call 
 Miss, text 
 Woke, spoke 
 Lie, feel, Lisa ew 
 Time, kill, months, still 
 I got somebody baby mama calling me daddy 
 I drank too much, please call me a cabby 
 Penthouse after party hoes want that addy 
 Fuck they can ride with us, crawl in a Caddy 
 Third row is when you call, I hit cancel 
 Really? I hit answer, fuck I hate when that happens 
 Phone in my pocket for the whole night 
 And you heard bitches screamin' till my phone dies 
 Then she text me like "why you still talk to my mama?" 
 How the fuck you run around with condoms? 
 Why you make me get this tattoo? 
 Man, fuck this tattoo you the reason I wasn't single in college 
 What? All because I had you 
 Nigga I don't even have you 
 How am I suppose to get past you? 
 And she called the next guy spillin' some real shit 
 Now they problems he got to deal with 
 When you said it was over 
 You shot right through my heart 
 Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart 
 Ooh, I was so mad 
 I should've seen this coming right from the start 
 You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart 
 Girl, don't believe them hoes 
 'Cause they don't wanna see us together 
 And you already know you're too fly 
 But baby, don't get your hair caught in the propellers 
 I be tryna tell her these hoes is jealous 
 You know they never like it when you never say never 
 Long hair, red bone, but her pussy is hairless 
 Muah, I French kiss it like we in Paris 
 I be screaming out, "ain't no woman like the one I got" 
 But she be always worrying about the one I fucked 
 She said it's gonna be me, myself and I 
 Damn, that would make me a one-eyed fuck 
 Sch, I was so mad 
 Damn, you used to ride a nigga like a moped pad sch-- 
 But players fuck up, my bad 
 And just to keep from crying, I laughed 
 When you said it was over 
 You shot right through my heart 
 Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart 
 Ooh, I was so mad 
 I should've seen this coming right from the start 
 You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart 
 Baby, last time calling me baby 
 Last time calling me crazy 
 Crazy, crazy 
 Baby, last time calling me baby 
 Last time calling me crazy 
 Crazy, crazy
