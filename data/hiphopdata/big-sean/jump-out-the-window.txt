I think I'm ready to jump out the window 
 And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend though 
 We already wasted too much time 
 And your time is the only thing I wish was mine 
 So if I think I'm ready to jump out the window 
 Know ya momma didn't raise you to take no disrespect, yeah 
 (I feel) I feel like real queens know how to keep the game in check, yeah 
 You cried on my phone the whole night 
 That time he crossed the line yeah, yeah, yeah 
 (Oh I was there) I went to straighten his ass out 
 And you told me never mind yeah 
 The question isn't, "Do he love ya?" 
 The question is, "Do ya love yourself?" 
 You give the best advice to your friends and not take it for yourself 
 Remember when you used to come through and hit the Mario Kart 
 And you always picked the Princess 
 I realized you was princess 
 Way back then we the best thing that never happened, but 
 I think I'm ready to jump out the window 
 And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend though 
 We already wasted too much time 
 And your time is the only thing I wish was mine 
 So if I think I'm ready to jump out the window 
 You been up at night, sleep deprivation 
 What's the hesitation? What's ya reservation? 
 You been trippin', trippin' with no destination 
 You need separation, you need recreation 
 Y'all been arguing every other day 
 Ya friends gotta step in and break it up like chill, chill, chill 
 It's no need to turn this into Kill Bill, look 
 Funny we ran into each other while we leaving 
 You walked in with a perm 
 And now yo hair look like The Weeknd's 
 I know that you been needin' clarity 
 Don't mean to sit ya down and turn this into therapy 
 But you gave too much time to that boy charity, hear me 
 I think I'm ready to jump out the window 
 And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend though 
 We already wasted too much time 
 And your time is the only thing I wish was mine 
 So yeah, I think I'm ready to jump out the window 
 I don't mean to sound like the jealous type 
 But you oughta know (oughta know) 
 I think me and you should get together sometimes 
 On the low low low (on the) 
 Sometimes I wonder if you even know 
 How much you worth, I gotta know 
 Sometimes I wonder if you even know 
 How much you worth, I gotta know 
 I don't mean to sound like the jealous type 
 But you oughta know (oughta know) 
 I think me and you should get together sometimes 
 On the low low low (low) 
 Sometimes I wonder if you even know 
 How much you worth, I gotta know 
 Sometimes I wonder if you even know 
 How much you worth I gotta know 
 I gotta know 
 I gotta know

 I think I'm ready to jump out the window 
 This one's for you, you, you, you
