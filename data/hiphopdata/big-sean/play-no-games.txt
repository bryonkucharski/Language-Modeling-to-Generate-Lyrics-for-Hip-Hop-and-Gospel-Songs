OK, I won't deny it 
 Half the time you send a text, yep, you know I'm not replying 
 Just to let you know, I'm not one of them niggas you be dodging 
 I'm the one that you dodge with 
 I'm the one that you gon' take that dress you saving out the closet 
 I'm the one you need alone 
 I'm the one that when you round your friends, that you gotta put on speakerphone 
 Just so you can let them know what we be on, like he the one 
 Yeah yeah, I know I'm young but you respect me like a father figure 
 Young mobbish nigga, probably make you farther figures 
 Sean Don Perrier out in Paris with a pair of Ye's going 
 Well, I would tell you but I gotta paraphrase 
 And even when you tripping, we tripping, I pay for ya 
 Gourmet for ya, chauffeur arranged for ya 
 I'll take that flight alone earlier in the day for ya 
 Just to beat you there and prepare, let you know I'm waiting for ya 
 Finally famous 
 I ain't like them other niggas 
 And I ain't bout to play no games with you 
 You know what your problem is? 
 You don't ever see the big picture 
 I want you to take me serious 
 Baby, I want you to take me serious 
 Wait, wait, waiting for ya 
 I be wait, wait, waiting for ya 
 You've got a young boss nigga like me waiting for ya 
 You've got that bomb ass pussy, I've been waiting for ya 
 Who ya love? Tell me who you fucking love 
 Tell me who you wanna fucking love 
 I left that sexy dress out on the bed with a note there laying for ya 
 With directions where I'm waiting with dinner and waiter for ya 
 I'm that nigga, she tell me I'm that nigga 
 I'm the nigga that's your nigga even when you got a nigga 
 That you make love with, but right before take drugs with 
 Then right after, hit the tub, wait on me with suds 
 Then you back that ass up on me like it's 99 
 Wine fine, like a bottle from the 99 
 Hit you with the 99 like it's fucking primetime 
 Killed the pussy, had to hit that shit like nine times 
 Girl, even when I'm gone, just know I'm there for ya 
 I'm all ears, in other words here for ya 
 I'd probably rob a fucking bank and go to jail for ya 
 As long as I can smack that ass and pull that hair for ya 
 Finally famous 
 I ain't like them other niggas 
 And I ain't bout to play no games with you 
 You know what your problem is? 
 You don't ever see the big picture 
 I want you to take me serious 
 Baby, I want you to take me serious 
 I've been waiting on that ass all night though 
 Girl, don't keep me waiting long 
 Yeah, yeah 
 It's true 
 Got some things I wanna do to you, baby 
 Oh

 And I ain't bout to play no games with you 
 You know what your problem is? 
 You don't ever see the big picture 
 I want you to take me serious 
 Baby, I want you to take me serious
