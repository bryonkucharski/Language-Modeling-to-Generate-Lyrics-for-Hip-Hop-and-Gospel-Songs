Lupe Fiasco: 
 Alarm clock said I'm too late 
 And they said I'm too weak I could use a few weights 
 So they said I took too long and don't look too strong 
 Well how long would you take? 
 Waiting's got me here in the first place 
 Another second, I've been second maybe third in the worst case 
 Now it's displayed in my wordplays 
 Moving weight, it's such a trap 
 Move and wait, you can't do that 
 I know I'm dope man but I can't move crack 
 And it's such a fracture when you're thinking 'bout your plans 
 But I try and bring it back before your brain hit the pan 
 Sean from Detroit, Lupe from Chicago land 
 But both of our chains say made in Japan 
 German engineers designed both of the Sedans 
 Ride with Mr. right on time, or stay Miss. another chance 
 Now, redirected at the girls, not an ultimatum just an option in this world 
 When things come and go, when the clocks never stop 
 Be on time for nothing, a little late for a lot
