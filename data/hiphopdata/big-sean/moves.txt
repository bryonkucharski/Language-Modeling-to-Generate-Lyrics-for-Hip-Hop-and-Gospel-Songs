Yeah 
 Sex game had her ass blowing me up (brrr) 
 Sex game had her ass texting me up

 Look, give me the ball and I will have to pass it 
 I ain't passing out until I'm asthma attacking 
 I take a plan and then I back to back it 
 Hit after hit, check the batting average 
 I take the work, flip it, acrobatic 
 Got a little time and a lot of talent 
 Do a little talking and a lot of action 
 Seen the competition, hmm... not a challenge 
 I lean, I move, I walk through in this bitch 
 Packed out but I can count on my hands 
 Who I'mma talk to in this bitch 
 Girls from law school in this bitch 
 Yeah, they paralegals, barely 21 
 That's very legal, but they doing shit that's probably barely legal 
 Awe man 
 It's that nigga that you probably least expected 
 I just had a couple dots that need connecting 
 Now your top 5 getting redirected 
 From here on out it'll be consecutive 
 We making moves like Tarantino, like J.J. Abrams 
 Moving like Channing Tatum 
 Moving like Jason Statham 
 Motherfuck the whole industry 
 Half of these niggas my mini-me's 
 I got this bitch going off more than breaking and entering 
 You hot for a minute, me 
 I make the shit that last for infinity 
 Hop in the booth, man that shit like a gym to me 
 Don't test the agility 
 Silly, silly, thinking that the negativity you talking could ever fuck up the tranquility 
 Okay, okay, okay, I'm on Rodeo for the day 
 If you owe me then you better pay your layaway, away 
 Stay away, or your ass might get K.O., kay today 
 Man that "pew! pew!" hit your ass from like way, oh ways, away 
 I got the moves 
 I got the moves (whoa) 
 I'm making moves 
 You gotta move (you gotta move) 
 She make that back move (damn) 
 She made her titties move (goddamn) 
 I make the city move (like whoa)

 Look, I'm a don, I'm a don, I'm a don (don) 
 I gave my whole family jobs and I take care of my mom 
 Me and my girl been through so much, that's my partner in crime 
 Touch any of the above, now you're harder to find 
 Gone
