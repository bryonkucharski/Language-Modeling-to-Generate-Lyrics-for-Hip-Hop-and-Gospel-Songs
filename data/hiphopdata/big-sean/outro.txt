Okay now, why you wanna go and do that, do that? 
 Sometimes I say that I'm the best, I guess I had to prove that 
 You know I had to cop that mansion on the hill and pool that 
 You know I don't rely on 8 balls, no, I never pooled that 
 You know I always like the best, roll it up and pull that 
 Now baby, don't get too deep on me, I might have to pull back 
 I got weed rolled, drinks po'd if you wanna do that 
 And I be in and out of love, the OGs be like true that 
 'Cause you know sometimes man, that shit can get way too irritating 
 Say the wrong thing to the right girl, you might not make it 
 Dark skin with a lightskin girl like Taye Diggs 
 And you go from tryna save her to her taking your savings 
 And when she do, man, watch how them bitches shit talk 
 Wonder how they would feel if our lives got criss-crossed 
 What if you lost your homie and you felt like Kriss Kross? 
 Double cross, I swear that Christians don't even get this cross 
 Talk so much shit that a nigga pissed off 
 She talk so much that she done fucking made my dick soft 
 Pushing all my buttons, this ain't fucking pinball 
 I guess women are sometimes like a jigsaw 
 Sometimes you hit a lick, sometimes you get ripped off 
 Sometimes you gotta sit, sometimes it's time for lift-off 
 Sometimes I just shut up and let my wrist talk 
 It be like "we don't got time for bullshit, dawg" 
 You know I'm 1 of 1, just like the prototype 
 You look like the "um, you owe me" type 
 Oh, hardly never taking pictures, not the photo type, no 
 Please don't Instagram this shit and be up on me like 
 "Oh, you owe me likes" 
 Man, I swear these bitches don't know what the fuck is more important to em 
 The more I kick philosophy, the more I'm boring to em 
 The more champagne I pop, the more I'm pouring to em 
 I just hope that's not the only single thing that's going through em 
 I hop up on a beat like it's the '08 me 
 When we was riding four deep, boy, no AC 
 Headed to the game for okay seats 
 Now I'm courtside at OKC, I know KD 
 And all these singing bitches know me like do-ray-mi 
 Fa-so-la-ti-do but dough come first 
 No late fees, Kool-Aid smile, Colgate teeth 
 The bigger that I get, the more I need shrinks 
 I be in and out of cars like a fucking crash dummy 
 Spending money till it's dizzy but I still stash something, you know 
 But I'm tryna get that real real money, like um 
 White people with a black son 
 And first time I met Oprah, that was motivation 
 Went from standing in court to starting up a corporation 
 Went so hard last night that we made the morning paper 
 Plus my girl's rated R, all your hoes overrated, damn 
 Niggas say I changed, how they damn how they do 
 Say I'm hard to get in contact with, oh, is that true? 
 But what about now? 313
