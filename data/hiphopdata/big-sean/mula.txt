Where my real niggas that's gonna ride with me 
 Where my fire freaks that's gonna ride with me 
 Where my real niggas that's gonna ride with me 
 Where my fire freaks that's gonna ride with me 
 Ain't nothing more important than the mula 
 Ain't nothing more important than the mula 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise god, hallelujah 
 Tell the police I'ma stack this paper till I overdose 
 Woodie, hoodie, slowly back your bitch ass up your over close 
 I overflow on all the hoes, my niggas is over height 
 Shooting up your phantom night and call your shit the holy ghost 
 Mercy, lord would you please have mercy 
 And protect me from the hoes if their life ain't sweet they go desert me 
 Shut the fuck up and stand out when you see me like I'm the verdict 
 That's respect now I got your wifey and you're back to using jerk and hurt 
 Sick and spill and tip it for my niggas who done passed away 
 Charge your ass a fuck you fee and make you pay your tax today 
 I'm on the secluded island, I swear I feel like cast away 
 Put that money in my shooter hands and tell 'em blast away 
 Look I feel like getting paper is my destiny 
 Till I rest in peace, getting money recipe 
 Throw my mic is what you want, bitch just leave the rest to me 
 Ain't no motherfucking rest for me, 
 'Cause 
 Ain't nothing more important than the mula 
 Ain't nothing more important than the mula 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise god, hallelujah 
 Ain't nothing more important than the mula 
 Ain't nothing more important than the mula 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise god, hallelujah 
 Ain't nothing more important than the mula 
 Diamond rings, hundred chains, slick rick the rula 
 I got cars, cribs all in my name 
 Got them m's all in that bank 
 Griff Blake all in that paint, stack some bread come watch me pray 
 Pray that never die broke get them cases by the boat 
 Went shopping bought the store, shorty snuck her fell that crab 
 Eating lobster on my dinner plate 
 Stacking all this money homie trying to see that ceiling break 
 Mula ain't everything homie, is the only thing 
 Came from the hall of piss straight to the hall of fame 
 Talking money we got it, thug boys shoot your style 
 Eating good I ain't brolic I'm just chasing them comma's haah 
 My niggas ride got five and my bitches ten 
 Got that china white call it German land 
 Ain't nothing more important than the mula 
 A chain, a fridge, deep freezer and a cooler 
 Ain't nothing more important than the mula 
 Ain't nothing more important than the mula 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise god, hallelujah 
 Ain't nothing more important than the mula 
 Ain't nothing more important than the mula 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise god, hallelujah 
 Where my real niggas that's gonna ride with me 
 Where my fire freaks that's gonna ride with me 
 Where my real niggas that's gonna ride with me 
 Where my fire freaks that's gonna ride with me
