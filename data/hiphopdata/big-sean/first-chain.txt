Coming from a city where bullets turn bro's into souls 
 Who knew from that concrete that a rose had arose 
 Good girls stopped being good when I turned 'em into hoes 
 Annotate Dreams stopped being dreams when I turned 'em into goals 
 BIG was the first one that had it 
 Then I saw Nas' chain, man, that was illmatic 
 Then I saw Kanye's hanging from his gold necklace 
 Then Ye gave me mine, that show you my work ethic 
 Mom had that hooptie that she ran in the dirt 
 Used to pick me up from school right after work 
 Now she rolling up in that Caddy like she coming to church 
 She's ask why I rock all this gold, 'cause I'm coming in first 
 Got the streets behind me like I was staring in the rear-view 
 Used to have to take showers standing in the mildew 
 Now I'm in the penthouse, look what a mill do 
 Looking in the mirror and I'm still you, I'm still you 
 Got my first chain 
 Feeling like I got my first chain 
 I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain 
 I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain 
 BIG was the first one that had it 
 Now Jacob the Jeweler benefit from my habits 
 I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain 
 I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain 
 What's the noise all about with this rap stuff 
 I can say I never been punked, robbed or smacked up 
 I can say I never been chased, jumped or backed up 
 I learned to patch it up to get passes to niggas who be acting up 
 'Cause it's a mental game, I learned that when I got my first initial chain 
 I didn't fake it, it was gold plated, I was posing relatin' 
 To those dealing with blow, had the big gold, bold anchors it was those gangsters 
 That bonus, that culture, those projects 
 Shiny shit on their necks, making both of my eyes squint 
 They got in my bones, now I'm coppin' stones 
 Sorry Sierra Leone, one day we'll right the wrongs 
 18 karat gold Cuban on, not too short, not too wide, not too long 
 My pendant offensive, in the truest form 
 Platinum gold, rose gold, what you want? 
 Got my first chain 
 Feeling like I got my first chain 
 I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain 
 I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain 
 BIG was the first one that had it 
 Then I saw Nas' chain, man, that was illmatic 
 And I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain 
 I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain 
 On a highway to heaven, look at all the tolls I paid 
 I done gave my city drive all the roads I paved 
 No matter what way I turn things go my way 
 I'm rocking chains everyday, so you know I slave 
 Even when I'm just walking 'round the crib, nigga 
 To remind me of everything that we did, nigga 
 Look up in the mirror, chain only thing lyin' 
 No heroes where I'm from, bullets only thing flying 
 I know the higher that I go, the harder to climb 
 But after that, the bigger the muscle and smarter the mind 
 Police only work 12-hour shifts 
 Cause in Detroit that's cheaper than the bailout, bitch 
 Trap house built brick by brick, paid dues on dues 
 FF, GOOD, you know I'm reppin' crew on crews 
 Stack bills on bills till my backyards got pools on pools 
 Girls on girls, lingerie and Moulin Rouge 
 God damn, I think I'm gon' O.D. 
 Off this asparagus and bread and pasta 
 Need a doctor, I've been dogding shady hoes and rainy days 
 It's like I got a built-in doppler 
 And it's a shame, a fuckin' shame 
 I don't remember my first love or my first time prayin' 
 But remember my first ass and the first time she came 
 It almost felt as good as when I got my first chain 
 Got my first chain 
 Feeling like I got my first chain 
 I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain 
 I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain 
 Jay-Z taught me money ain't a thing 
 Came from the streets, headed to the hall of fame 
 Stunting, stunting like I got my first chain 
 I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain 
 It's such a wonderful thing, to see the end of all things 
 Niggas and bitches, where you at? 
 I got my mind is on me, a couple others and dreams 
 Would've seen me and my niggas in this bitch 
 About two months in a week's time 
 Went from feelin' hellish to godly with lemon-lime shine 
 Now how the fuck can I chill now? Kanye think I'm dope 
 See this piece that I own now, how sick is the rope? 
 Taking life for what it is, the troublesome chick 
 Who throws fists; sometimes it's the weather 
 Things switch up, people trip up 
 The money come down, then climb up, but when it come again 
 The most creepin', deceivin', men are scheme-schemin' 
 Saying that you love me, I surely hope and if you don't 
 Motherfuck that sometimes, so dead it 
 Shred it; young nigga lost to the night 
 I'm so ready to let it go, my life is fucking awesome 
 I could be fuckin' dead right now but I'm awesome 
 So fuck whoever has a bad thought don't know the god 
 'Cause when I leave this bitch you all gon' wish you knew the God 
 It might be too late, but the songs will live on 
 Just know this fact, you were all wrong 
 Now watch me do my silly dance, not really a dance 
 More like a prance - I'm signing off with a crotch grab 
 Thank you man for letting me get on this record, Sean 
 You the coolest 
 GOOD Music nigga forever 
 Understand? Yum.
