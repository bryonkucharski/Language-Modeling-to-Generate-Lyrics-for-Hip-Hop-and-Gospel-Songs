I know I said it, 
 Many times before 
 I've always said that some day I'd leave, 
 And never come back no more. 
 Maybe one day, 
 I have the strength to leave. 
 I know you told all your friends. 
 What a fool, he'll always be. 
 But as soon as I try, 
 Something takes a hold of me inside. 
 Yes, it does. 
 Oh baby! 
 (Gamble) 
 I'm not trying to threaten you baby, 
 That's not something I would do. 
 But maybe the thought of losing me, 
 Should show you I'm your fool. 
 Maybe one day, 
 I have the strength to leave. 
 I know you told all your friends. 
 What a fool, he'll always be. 
 But as soon as I try, 
 Something takes a hold of me inside. 
 Yes, it does. 
 Oh baby! 
 (Gamble) 
 I've been a fool!
