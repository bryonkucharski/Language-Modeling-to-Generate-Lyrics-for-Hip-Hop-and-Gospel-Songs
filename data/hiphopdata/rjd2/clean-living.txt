Everything you are to me 
 Makes me think that you could be 
 The end to all my 
 Everything you touch turns right 
 Underneath your very eyes 
 Everybody's life rolls by 
 Like a melancholy song 
 Can you see me differently? 
 I believe that you see me 
 Everything you are to me 
 Makes me think that you could be 
 The end to all my 
 Everything you touch turns right 
 Underneath your very eyes
