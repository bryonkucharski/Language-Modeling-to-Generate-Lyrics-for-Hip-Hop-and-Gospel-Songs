(Repeat: x2) 
 Girl I know you won't come back. 
 I've got to get a hold of this. 
 But if it won't work out, 
 What will I do? 
 If I could have my way you would, 
 Be just a memory to fade, 
 Until that no one here would ever find. 
 Girl I know you won't come back. 
 I've got to get a hold of this. 
 But if it won't work out, 
 What will I do? 
 Could've loved you. 
 What will I do?
