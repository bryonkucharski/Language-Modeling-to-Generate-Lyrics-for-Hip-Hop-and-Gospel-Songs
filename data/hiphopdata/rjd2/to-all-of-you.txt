To all you kind! 
 And to all of you sad! 
 To all of you ladies, 
 And you call yourself playing. 
 Ain't nobody knows the game you wanna play, 
 Believe me when I say. 
 Let's keep some good! 
 To all you kind! 
 And to all of you sad! 
 To all of you ladies, 
 And you caught yourself playing. 
 And especially to all of your living! Living! Living! 
 And you call yourselves pimping. 
 To all you kind! 
 And to all of you sad 
 And especially to all of your living! Living! Living! 
 And you call yourselves pimping.
