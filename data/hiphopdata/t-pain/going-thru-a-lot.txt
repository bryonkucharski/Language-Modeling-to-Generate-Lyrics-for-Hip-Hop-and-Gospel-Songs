 Konvict Muzic... it's time to do it 
 I can't handle all these bills and payments 
 This stuff is overstressin me (but I still gotta do it) 
 Baby mama put me on them papers and get nothing for the baby (but I still gotta do it) 
 I can't keep on working, (keep on working) 
 Seems like the whole world's ignoring me (but I still gotta do it) 
 Schemers keep on dirking (keep on dirking) 
 Everybody's getting more than me (but I still gotta do it) 
 So pass that drag, pass that dro, it's my life 
 So what you think, what you know? 
 Yes all right and I paid the price, but still I'm 
 Going through a lot, sittin' on the block now 
 Through a lot, slangin out my drop now 
 Through a lot, nobody's helping me whether they see it or not 
 Going through a lot, I'm hittin on the cops now 
 Through a lot, wishin they would stop now 
 Through a lot, nobody's helping me whether they see it or not

 All this music got me going crazy, 
 Can't even concentrate on my family (but I still gotta do it) 
 Plus I gotta go through all this family hatred, 
 I don't know why everybody's hatin' me (but I still gotta do it) 
 Even one of my homeboys thinking that I'm bangin' his lady, 
 I don't know why he would think that outta me (but he gotta go through it) 
 To all the nappy headz I got you baby, 
 We bout make it yes indeed (and we gon get through it)

 I work a nine to five shawty and they think it's funny, 
 And how they feel that my stress don't count homie, 
 I hit the beat like a cop when I hit the block, 
 Because my baby's gotta eat, I ain't gon never stop, 
 I see them laughin' at me fo 'cause my pants red, 
 And my do' won't shut and my car's shabby, 
 But I see the future man like I'm nostradamus, 
 And in my heart all I see is a future star, 
 But in my brain ain't nothing but these notes man, 
 But y'all don't feel my stress y'all don't understand, 
 The next step is my pistol and it goes down, 
 Wiggle it out fat boy just calm down, 
 And sing this song, and sing that song, 
 Cause god gon make a way for me to get my hustle on.
