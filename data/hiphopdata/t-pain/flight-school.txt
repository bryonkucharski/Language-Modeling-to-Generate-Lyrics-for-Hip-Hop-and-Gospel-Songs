 Baby, just forget everything that you know 
 Let's take it all the way back to hello 
 They say you're living like you died before 
 I got a place that only I can go 
 Uuuh let me take you to flight school 
 We'll learn to fly 
 Uuuh let me take you to flight school 
 The northern lights 
 Hey 
 You've never been so high kiss the ground goodbye 
 And you say damn baby how did you get that fly 
 Flight School 
 (Kanye West) 
 I got my superman power, my superman cape 
 These the last hours but superman late 
 Cock is ticking, damn, can you wait 
 Man will he come back and save the day 
 Fly across the earth put things in reverse 
 I wish this life was a movie I could just rehearse 
 Certain things I can't doctor and you say I'm the worst 
 I ain't have enough patience but I needed a nurse 
 That'll come by my bed late, see if my head ache 
 Then get my head straight then give me head great 
 Every time I popped up like the VCR 
 I took your breath away then we performed CPR 
 With all the cars the clothes, the lights, the boats 
 I guess I was just trying to sow my raw oats 
 In the penthouse position with penthouse b!tches 
 See I pimped my crib so I must exhibit 
 Shit these last years been a haze like Isaac 
 So I close my eyes tighter than asian eyes 
 Get realize I got the same wings angels fly with 
 Louis Vuitton feathers now that's some fly sh!t

 Baby

 Uuuh let me take you to flight school 
 We'll learn to fly 
 Uuuh let me take you to flight school 
 The northern lights 
 Hey 
 You've never been so high kiss the ground goodbye 
 And you say damn baby how did you get that fly
