Me undercover fist poppin' with your cousin 
 Pull up to the club, let you hear the speakers bump 
 With a honey in the Hummer got her cumming on my thong 
 I get second to none, drummer steady drumming 
 And I don't need keys, I'm just stumping on the button 
 Shawty want my lovin' she not thinking of the others 
 So I told her get in line, she can come and take a number 
 She looking at my pocket like she getting something from me 
 And if she thinks she is then this bitch is really dumb 
 And I'm a boss, get lost, Maybach, Rick Ross 
 I'm looking for a chick with the ability to get that booty jumping 
 You see what I got kicking put my meat up in that oven 
 And when it's all over, you can get ready for supper 
 They say that I'm a porn star, call me T pumper 
 Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', 
 What you say 
 Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', 
 What you say 
 Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', 
 Hey I got you shakin' that thing like- 
 Hell no, hell no, 
 Said her ass so fat, she ain't even tryna tuck it 
 Got her sittin' here fucking like it's nothin', nothin', nothin' 
 Hey look at this motherfuckin' rug that I'm cutting 
 These bitches act sedated but these chickens steady clucking, 
 Like it's nothin', nothin', nothin' 
 And they don't give a fuck if I'm up in the Maserati, 
 Or I'm ducking in the bucket and I love it 
 Big Chain, teddy p, T-Pain, that's me 
 I do my thang, 28's turning lane 
 They see me with a couple bad bitches and they know I keep it trucking 
 Bottle of that drink and I'm feeling kinda lucky 
 And if they're playing games it's the deuces that I'm talking 
 'Cause they know why they came they ain't fucking, nigga fuck them 
 In the hood, wassup? Damn right you gonna let a nigga cut 
 Fo' sho', me no, Teddy playin' from the A50 plus a nigger ain't 
 Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', 
 What you say 
 Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', 
 What you say 
 Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', 
 Hey I got you shakin' that thing like- 
 Hell no, hell no, 
 Said her ass so fat, she ain't even tryna tuck it 
 Got her sittin' here fucking like it's nothin', nothin', nothin'
