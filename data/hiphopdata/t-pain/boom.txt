Get your money, whip ya hair 
 Executive branch blow my smoke like a player 
 Yeah in the club, yes it cracks 
 Cute little mama, but they stack with backs 
 I'm smokin' great purple urple 
 You and Doggie world come and join my circle 
 I'll break down herbal till I move like a turtle 
 My money is green and my Porsche is turbo 
 In hot pursuit, come rock with Snoop 
 Maybe is the lawyer, her body's the truth 
 I'm in the game for real, it pays to chill 
 I walk in the club and they front the bill 
 I'm the big dog, best beware 
 You're coming with me, if you stop and stare 
 She'll be on my team in my car on the way to the spot 
 Yes you are, toasting up, posting up 
 And when we done, we west coasting love 
 For shendo blowin' endo, 
 How much for the dog in the window 
 Oh, what? 
 Boom, boom 
 Say what, say what 
 Boom

 Baby I'm a dog (I'm a dog), beware (beware) 
 I'll do whatever, however I want (I want) 
 So yippie yah (yippie yah) oh yeah (oh yeah) 
 Now put your hands in the air and whip your hair and go 
 La la la la la 
 Boom shakalaka when I drop all of my apples, say 
 La la la la la 
 Shawty know that I ain't playing 
 I'm all about the money, the money I got 
 On the VIP tip, Maseratis in the lot 
 Chillin' with stars where the bottle never stops 
 Got a model on my lap, Baby show me what you got 
 With a cup of Landy, Tiffany and Sandy 
 Girls who like girls, wanna do it today 
 Real tough, this suites is next 
 One more drink gon' lead to sex 
 These girls is bad, the flow is pack? 
 They shut the Dogg down when he reach the max 
 Whatcha trying to drink, clearer yet? 
 She got Apple Bottom, homie, all I need do is mack 
 I does it well, your game is whack 
 I guess to the bit is no chit chat

 Boom shakalaka here comes the chief like I smoke good 
 With T-pain, Snoop, the weed doctor 
 Big 808 now filled the basin in ya chakra 
 And watch me smoke like a shotta 
 Coke bottle shape like green eyes 
 Drunk offa love like a colt 45 
 I keep kush in my lungs 
 I'm a smoke till I die 
 Just bust a bad one for my homie d-dimes, boom 
 They do it for fortune, some for fame 
 I got five different strains 
 You ever taste purple rain 
 Turn up the volume, adjust the game 
 Ain't a damn thing change, still a G thang 
 Lil' mama whip ya hair 
 Exhale the chronic as the smoke disappears 
 I'm ready to ball 
 Your girl on my team, and she ready to fall 
 And if you didn't know, I'm the big Snoop Dogg 
 Talk to them T Pain
