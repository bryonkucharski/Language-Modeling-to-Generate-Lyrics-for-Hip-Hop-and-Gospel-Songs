 Marinate on the there 
 Tallahassee Love (ya) 
 (T-Pain) 
 They thought I left man (hahahahaha) 
 Yeah, T-P-A-I-N let's go man (aye) 
 T-Pain man, I'm back in this thang 
 You already know what it is (hey) 
 Tallahassee got my back though 
 This how I went (aye) 
 (VERSE 1: (T-Pain) 
 I used to hit the stage with my shades on 
 40 brought me to the West Coast 
 Now it's khaki suits with my shades on 
 I'm on the same shit Game on 
 But on Sundays I'm like Diddy - grown man with one chain on 
 When I come back, niggas see my group 
 They see my Momma's two cars and both od my Daddy's boats 
 They see the Sean Jean coats and they see my wife hoppin out 
 The Lamborghini with the Coach bag 
 I'm gettin' paid for nothin' 
 Sittin' back, drinkin' lemonade, chillin' in the shade I'm stuntin 
 Makin' hits when I graze the button 
 Go ahead and put them two baby seats in my Escalade, it's nothin' 
 I'm gettin' money - learned from the pastand the future 
 Learned not to never stab a nigga that'll shot ya 
 Even though my pockets gettin' fatter 
 I'm still gettin' Tallahassee Love and that's all that matters 
 J-Lyriq get em 
 (HOOK: (J-Lyriq) 
 I been there, and I've been back 
 But somethin' here always brings me back 
 So when I'm here, I get that TALLAHASSEE LOVE 
 If you love me, then I love you 
 My people love it, when I come through 
 So when I do, I get that TALLAHASSEE LOVE 
 (T-Pain) 
 It shouldn't have to be like this man 
 I don't know how I did it either man 
 I know you haters hatin' this right here boy 
 Tallahassee love 
 Second time around, let's go man!
