Ladies and Gentlemen 
 You are now in tune to a unknown buffoon 
 With enough boom in his tune to blow your mind like BOOM 
 Then you assume that I've done something wrong in my life 
 But at the same time I'm gonna try to describe the vibe of the world through my eyes 
 And maybe you won't despise me or try to deprive me of the that respect I need 
 Oh I see, you don't know that a nigga motor just blow 
 And I'm walkin' by myself talking to myself 
 Up and down the streets when both my feet's is in old shoes 
 And all these old dudes talking bout 
 Oh it ain't that bad I walked through the snow to school 
 Bitch we live in Tallahassee, a place where it never snows 
 But it rains on pain cause [xxx] can't take it 
 My head is a mailbox and its full and I don't wanna check it 
 I wanna buy a whole damn car just to wreck it 
 Cause this fuck nigga told my wife I got two other girls pregnant (damn man) 
 Now you think I'm gonna change cause my wife cries all night 
 And I'm not quite the husband type? 
 You damn right 'cause I've been livin' my whole damn life with all my damn might 
 And my damn light bill is due and one day I might see you and if I fight with you I can take your life in two ways, the hard way and a bad way cause 
 If I have a bad day then you might not make it to that 
 Youngblood's concert (boom boom stomp) 
 Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm sorry if I'm losin you 
 But I'm just sick and tired of tryin' to get mine 
 So don't come to me with your 23's with that fake-ass smile 
 Smoking on your black and mild cause all the wild I know what your sayin' in your head, this nigga go stronger than me, longer than me, but he ain't never gonna be shit cause everything belongin to me. 
 See I refuse to be abused and misused and accused of not payin' my dues 
 I am not a crack addict but if you want everything I got, you gonna get it cause imma let yo ass have it 
 Yeah, ok now, what you do is, marinate on that 
 Ahoooooooooo (x 4)
