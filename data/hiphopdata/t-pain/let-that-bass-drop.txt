(T-Pain whispering) 
 Feel good baby? Turn the lights off... turn the TV off... STOP. Don't do that... 
 (T-Pain) 
 We're in the bed and we both know what time it is 
 Ain't no use in playin' wit it 
 In my head waitin for the perfect time to 
 Drop that bass on you 
 What ya think about it? 
 How does it feel baby? 
 I know you like it 
 You can't do nothin' but ride wit it (C'mon) 
 Why is my hand touching your leg 
 I need to wait for the right time to 
 You think it's cool (Yeah) 
 You think it's cool so do I 
 Now if it's one thing I gotta do to you 
 I'm not leaving out this room until I 
 But what if I go down 
 And further down 
 And further down 
 And further down 
 And further down 
 To your belly chain--sike (I'm just playin') 
 But what id I go further down 
 And further down 
 And further down 
 And further down 
 And further down 
 Make you say my name 
 Twice 
 Now you can try to find it if you wanna 
 But I'm tellin' ya babe 
 This feeling is uncontrolable 
 And this is the first time for us 
 So trust 
 Is a must 
 That high (hiiiiiigh) 
 Take your clothes off 
 Go 'head and show off 
 What you got 
 Look at that pretty face on ya 
 Slim waist on ya 
 Girl ya make wanna (what you gonna do?) 
 Shit 
 Excuse my language baby 
 But all I can say is 
 Shit 
 (T-Pain talking) 
 Nah, we don't need it 
 It feels so good without it 
 I think it's bout that time
