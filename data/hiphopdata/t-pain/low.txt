(Intro - T-Pain) 
 Let me talk to 'em 
 Let me talk to 'em 
 Let me talk to 'em 
 C'mon! 
 Chorus (T-Pain): 
 Shawty had them apple bottom jeans (jeans) 
 Boots with the fur (with the fur) 
 The whole club was looking at her 
 She hit the floor (she hit the floor) 
 Next thing you know 
 Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low 
 Them baggy sweat pants 
 And the Reebok's with the straps (with the straps) 
 She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (hey) 
 She hit the floor (she hit the floor) 
 Next thing you know 
 Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low 
 (Flo-Rida) 
 I ain't never seen something that'll make me go 
 This crazy all night spending my doe 
 Had the million dollar vibe and a body to go 
 Them birthday cakes they stole the show 
 So sexual 
 She was flexible professional 
 Drinking X&O 
 Hold up, wait a minute, do I see what I think? Whoa 
 Did her thing seen shawty get low 
 Ain't the same when it's up that close 
 Make it rain I'm making it snow 
 Work the pole I gotta bank roll 
 I'm gonna say that I prefer the no clothes 
 I'm in to that I love women exposed 
 She threw it back at me I gave her mo 
 Cash ain't a problem I know where it go 
 (Chorus (T-Pain)) 
 (Flo-Rida) 
 Hey shawty what I gotta do to get you home 
 My jeans filled with guap and they're ready for showing 
 Cadillacs laid back for the sexy grown 
 Patron on the rocks that'll make you moan 
 One stack (come on), two stacks (come on), three stacks (come on) 
 Now that's three grand 
 What you think I'm playing baby girl I'm the man 
 I'm dealing rubber bands 
 That's when I threw her legs on my shoulders 
 I knew it was over 
 That heny and Cola got me like a soldier 
 She ready for Rover, I couldn't control her 
 So lucky on me I was just like clover 
 Shawty was hot like a toaster 
 Sorry but I had to fold her 
 Like a pornography poster 
 She showed her 
 (Chorus (T-Pain)) 
 (Flo-Rida) 
 Whoa shawty yeah she was worth the money 
 Little mama took my cash 
 And I ain't want it back 
 The way she bent that back 
 Got all them paper stacks 
 Tattoo above her crack 
 I had to handle that 
 I was zoned in sexy woman 
 Let me show it make me want it 
 Two in the morning I'm zoned in 
 Them rosee bottles foaming 
 She wouldn't stop 
 Made it drop 
 Shawty dipped that pop and lock 
 Had to break her off that guap 
 Gal was fine just like my glock 
 (Chorus (T-Pain))
