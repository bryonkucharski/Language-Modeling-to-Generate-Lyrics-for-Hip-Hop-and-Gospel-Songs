Somebody tell me who died 
 And made you boss 
 I put it all aside, yeah 
 There wasn't a dry eye in the house 
 Nobody cried (nobody cried) 
 When I lost 
 And I learned everything that day 
 I just wanna say 
 Thank you, I thank you 
 I appreciate it, I appreciate it 
 I came up 
 Now he hate it, now she hate it 
 I just wanna say 
 Thank you, I thank you 
 I appreciate it, I appreciate it 
 I got the bag now 
 Now he hate it (hey!), now she hate it 
 I just wanna say! 
 I'm doing good, I'm doing good (yeah!) 
 Everything is still everything, I did everything I said I would (ooh) 
 I just wanna say 
 I'm doing good, I'm doing good (yeah!) 
 Everything is still everything, I did everything I said I would 
 I hit the billboards with a baseball bat 
 Hit after hit, so I understand why you don't wanna face all that 
 I been with the shits 
 My track record looking like I got baseball stats 
 Roger Clements with the pitch 
 Now these niggas busy trynna erase all that 
 Ain't that a bitch? (boot!) 
 I did everything for the culture 
 At gun point, with the mask off 
 But I ain't cry about it, I ain't lie about it 
 I just kept working my ass off 
 Now all of a sudden everybody figured out what I was sayin' back in '05 
 The whip ain't shit if the nigga in the driver seat ain't got no drive 
 If you ain't call me when you fly nigga 
 Don't call me when you in a nose dive 
 'Cause I remember all that Twitter shit 
 I thought you said that it was your time 
 Just sit back while I get my shit back 
 And tell these niggas that it's showtime 
 Somebody tell me who died 
 And made you boss 
 I put it all aside, yeah 
 There wasn't a dry eye in the house 
 Nobody cried (nobody cried) 
 When I lost 
 And I learned everything that day 
 I just wanna say 
 Thank you, I thank you 
 I appreciate it, I appreciate it 
 I came up 
 Now he hate it, now she hate it 
 I just wanna say 
 Thank you, I thank you 
 I appreciate it, I appreciate it 
 I got the bag now 
 Now he hate it (hey!), now she hate it 
 I just wanna say! 
 I'm doing good, I'm doing good (yeah!) 
 Everything is still everything, I did everything I said I would (ooh) 
 I just wanna say 
 I'm doing good, I'm doing good (yeah!) 
 Everything is still everything, I did everything I said I would
