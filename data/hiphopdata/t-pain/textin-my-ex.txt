You don't even know right now 
 I'm staring at my phone right now 
 Wondering if I should call you or leave you 'lone right now 
 I'm in my zone right now 
 I'm just, chilling at home right now 
 Shots of Patron right now 
 I should put my phone right down 
 But girl, I'm so alone right now 
 That's why I'm... 
 Textin' my ex (oh no) 
 Don't nothing look good 
 I'm just talkin' 'bout sex (yeah) 
 Ooh, that's why I'm textin' my ex (oh no) 
 Don't nothing look good 
 I'm just talkin' 'bout sex 
 And I'm so ready for regrets 
 Yeah, baby, baby 
 I know you remember way, way back in December we was in love, yeah 
 I've been thinking of you 
 Please tell me that I'm the one you're thinking of, yeah 
 I just can't forget you now since I met you down in the club, ye-yeah 
 I know that I let you down, but we need to just link back up, yeah 
 Probably shouldn't call you 
 But you know I'm 'bout to call you 
 And I don't even need to fall through 
 But I'm a man, baby, ain't that what we all do? 
 I understand what you tweetin' out 
 Hoping I'm the man that you speaking 'bout 
 But you didn't @ me 
 Hope my new girl don't catch me 
 Textin' my ex (oh no) 
 Don't nothing look good 
 I'm just talkin' 'bout sex (yeah) 
 Ooh, that's why I'm textin' my ex (oh no) 
 Don't nothing look good 
 I'm just talkin' 'bout sex 
 And I'm so ready for regrets 
 Yeah, baby, baby 
 I know you remember way, way back in December we was in love, yeah 
 I've been thinking of you 
 Please tell me that I'm the one you're thinking of, yeah 
 I just can't forget you now since I met you down in the club, ye-yeah 
 I know that I let you down, but we need to just link back up, yeah, yeah 
 You know you shouldn't call me 
 So why the hell you call me? 
 You know I got a new man 
 But this unknown number, this is all you 
 Even though this ain't right 
 I'll give it to you, I won't think twice 
 Didn't mean to hurt you 
 Just hope your new girl don't catch you texting your ex 
 Don't nothing look good 
 I'm just talkin' 'bout sex (yeah) 
 Ooh, that's why I'm textin' my ex (oh no) 
 Don't nothing look good 
 I'm just talkin' 'bout sex 
 I'm so ready for regrets 
 Yeah, baby, baby
