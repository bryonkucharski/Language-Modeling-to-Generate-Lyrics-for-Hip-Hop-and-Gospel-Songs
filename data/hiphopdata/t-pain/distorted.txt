 {Where is everybody} 
 {Don't stop now} 
 {Don't stop now} 
 Hey, yeah 
 I don't really wanna do nothing today 
 Just wanna do you tonight (you tonight) 
 And the only way that I'll be satisfied is if I do you right (do you right) 
 I want you to feel it coming 
 Stronger longer 
 If fucking you ain't a right then a dude then I can't get no wronger 
 I'm pulling hair slapping derrières 
 All you gotta do is say {Don't stop now} 
 And I won't I promise this 
 I'm gone be the dominant one 
 I got you bitch squeeze that pillow bite that shit 
 Uh it feel good don't it tell me that you want it 
 Shawty call me daddy {Don't stop now} 
 Don't stop it stop it don't stop it 
 Stop it don't stop it stop it don't stop it 
 Stop it don't stop it stop it don't stop it 
 Stop it don't stop it stop it don't 
 Don't stop now 
 Girl I don't really know what else I can say 
 But baby girl you look tight (you look tight) 
 And I'm sitting right here looking in your eyes and they're telling me everything you might like (you might like) 
 I want you to feel it coming 
 From a bigga nigga 
 I'm not what you're used to fucking with (oh no) 
 I'm a little bit thicker 
 I'm pulling hair slapping derrières 
 All you gotta do is say (Don't stop now) 
 And I won't I promise this 
 I'm gone be the dominant one 
 I got you bitch squeeze that pillow bite that shit 
 Uh it feel good don't it tell me that you want it 
 Shawty call me daddy {Don't stop now} 
 Don't stop it stop it don't stop it 
 Stop it don't stop it stop it don't stop it 
 Stop it don't stop it stop it don't stop it 
 Stop it don't stop it stop it don't 
 Don't stop now
