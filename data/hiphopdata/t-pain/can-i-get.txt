I feel so much better 
 I know I said I'll never ever drink again (again again) 
 But now I feel like I never had before 
 I'll get out on the floor and show them what is wrong 
 Patron can I get that Grammy 
 Can I get that pole? Can I get that Henny? 
 Can I get that Marguerita on the rock rock rock? 
 I think it's up all around that rim rim 
 Patron can I get that Grammy 
 Can I get that pole? Can I get that Henny? 
 Can I get that Marguerita on the rock rock rock? 
 I think it's up all around that rim rim 
 Can I get that? 
 When I walk up in the club I hit that? 
 Shawty wanna break me off like a kitkat 
 Get a couple bottles and a couple models and I wanna sip that 
 Drone, put 'em in the zone 
 Can I Hit that, hit it when I'm already in it 
 Can I get that margarita when I'm chillin' with a mamasita? 
 Imma See you later on tonight 
 I say, I shut 
 My bed, I'm in 
 The club instead party rockin' with my baby 
 So now I'll never say never 
 She'll leave me if I let 'er 
 That's why I gotta keep 'er on the dance floor 
 Tell her, I feel so much better 
 I know I said I'll never ever drink again (again again) 
 But now I feel like I never had before 
 I'll get out on the floor and show them what is wrong
