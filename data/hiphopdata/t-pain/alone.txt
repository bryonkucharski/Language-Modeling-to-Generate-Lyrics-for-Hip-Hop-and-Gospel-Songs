 Cause you was short, brown skin, and you had ADAT... 
 And then I heard your voice come out, I unballed my fist,

 The sound that you made was sweeter then watermelon, 
 If bein beautiful was a crime then you a felon... 
 You was right next door so I could see you anytime, 
 Dinner time, spring, fall, summer, winter time...
