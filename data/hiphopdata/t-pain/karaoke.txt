Dear Akon forgive me for what I'm about to say 
 Dear Barry Wize I know you told me 
 Not to worry about it, man, but I can't let it ride 
 Dear God let's make it happen 
 I'm tryin' to be you, nigga, yeah nigga 
 Watch me do me, watch me do me 
 Watch me do me, watch me do me, yeah 
 Nappy Boy, Nappy Boy 
 DJ Khaled, aye yo Pain, I want you to go in 
 DJ Khaled, let's go man, we the best listen 
 I got up out the streets, so I ain't gotta steal 
 But listen to the radio it's obvious I still kill 
 But y'all was in the game way before me 
 So why you wanna do some shit I did in '03? 
 I'm layin' low key for a long time 
 But don't act like you know me, this is the wrong time 
 So grab ya microphone, set your auto tune and I'm a bust 
 A verse on yo ass like I oughta do 
 I ain't no gangsta dude, I ain't got a poppin' banga 
 But you know I'm powerful 
 When I'm pissin' off the gospel singer's 
 I'm tryin' to feed my kids, y'all niggas can die slowly 
 'Cause to me, it sound like a bunch of karaoke 
 Aye yo, fuck the imposter 
 Fuck these karaoke niggas, man 
 T-Pain, they wanna live your life, man 
 These some bitch ass niggas, man 
 It's the DJ Khaled, Nappy Boy 
 I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in, aye yo T-pain 
 I know you Khaled, I know you right now 
 Let me get 'em again 
 Listen it ain't all bad, some of ya please me 
 But the only niggas that's cool is Kanye and Lil' Weezy 
 I'm a hit maker, not a comedian 
 So why the fuck were these niggas laughin' at me 
 When I seen they ass? 
 This shit would never work, a one hit wonder bitch 
 But all that shit that you doin' now make me wonder this 
 Now why it's cool for you but it's not for me? 
 And why he ain't hop on my song and make it hot for me? 
 But you don't give a fuck, you just a swagger jacker 
 Now I'm a certified Lamborghinist and Cadillacer 
 'Cause I'm tryna feed my kids, y'all niggas can die slowly 
 'Cause just to me it sound like a bunch of karaoke 
 Y'all singin' the same old song, y'all some karaoke niggas 
 Karaoke fuck niggas, this is Nappy Boy 
 This is DJ Khaled, We Global with this hood shit 
 This what we do, why you wanna live our life? 
 You wanna live our lifestyle, aye yo T-Pain 
 Waddup Khaled, get them 
 Let me get a moment of silence for the late great Roger Troutman 
 Y'all niggas ain't holdin' it down, so we had to put me at ya 
 Bitch, I'm Teddy Pain, the son of Teddy Riley 
 The father of the game, you bustin' niggas wildin' 
 How many niggas really wanna test? 
 Pain nigga riggen gotta be the best 
 Only muthafuckas tryna do what I did stealin' 
 Food from an infant sty from a kid 
 Twenty four years, twenty four cars 
 Bitch we the best we got plenty more stars 
 Every time you pussy muthafucka's try to stop me 
 It's plenty more hits, plenty more bars 
 Yeah, that's not cool baby, so that's not happenin' 
 Y'all keep on stealin' from me, let me try this rappin' thing 
 I know you know I hear ya, isn't that embarrassin'? 
 Set the game on fire, Teddy got some mean 
 Pussy nigga's step up if you really got good game 
 I got a lot of shit to say about a nigga but it's really not good things 
 That ain't no disrespect man, Y'all keep doin' ya shit 
 But my daughter told me to tell you to get off her daddy's dick 
 Aye yo Pain man I'm a call these niggas out 
 I'm a pull them skirts man, they fucked aye oh 
 Let me get them, fuck it 
 It's the DJ Khaled (Incomprehensible) 
 Big dog pit bull jamma scordian 
 Aka we da best, aka shit on nigga's dot com 
 Aka Nappy Boy bitch, We Global, We Global
