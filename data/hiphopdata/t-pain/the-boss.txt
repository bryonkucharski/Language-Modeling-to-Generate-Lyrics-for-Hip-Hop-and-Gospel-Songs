I got a fresh line up, fresh outfit 
 'Bout to have the parking lot on smash 
 Plus I got a Chevy with a 4-54 in the hood that bitch got 1-25 in the dash 
 (She like a gangsta cause) 
 I'm the biggest boss that ya seen thus far 
 I'm the biggest boss that ya seen thus far 
 I'm the biggest boss that ya seen thus far 
 'Cause it's just another day in the life of a God damn boss 
 I don't make love baby we make magic 
 Come home with a thug, let's get shit crackin' 
 Always wear plastic baby cause shit happens 
 She leaves the backseat just to freak in the magnum 
 Hopped out the magnum hopped in the tray 
 Just to let the top back and thank God for the day 
 Who gives a fuck what a hater gotta say? 
 I made a couple million dollars last year dealin' weight 
 Still in the streets strapped with them thangs 
 She in love with a G so she tatted my name (Ross!) 
 I'm the biggest boss that ya seen thus far 
 Ten black maybacks back to back in a lane 
 I'm a make it rain then I'm a make it back 
 You are just a lame lil' homie that's a fact 
 Workin' with the police actin' like ya know me 
 Fresh outta jail already in ya hoe's sheets 
 The boss, boss, boss, the boss 
 Shawty straight diggin' me and I ain't even rich 
 I know you niggas on the sideline like ain't that a bitch 
 I'm on my job and I ain't gettin' off 
 'Cause it's just another day in the life of the goddamn boss 
 I'm the biggest boss that you seen thus far 
 Got the biggest car Spanish broads no bra 
 Callin' otha lames for the walks in the park 
 I ain't come to play games I just wanna play my part 
 Tell ya girlfriend to come talk with my dawg 
 We straight G's and we came here to ball 
 Bottle after bottle and I'm sure you count 'em all 
 Then we off to the Chevy fire it up and takin' off 
 Baby slow it down cause you movin' to fast 
 Ya ass too fine to be movin' too fast 
 Back to the thuggin' now I'm sippin' sy-z-urp 
 All my niggas love it baby that's my w-is-ord 
 Stack for the jeans five bones for the sh-is-irt 
 I don't smoke 28? 800 for the? 
 I'm the biggest boss that you seen thus far 
 You can tell by the shon's that's standin' by the car 
 Ay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ay 
 Ay, uh huh, yeah, uh huh, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 I'm the biggest boss that ya seen thus far
