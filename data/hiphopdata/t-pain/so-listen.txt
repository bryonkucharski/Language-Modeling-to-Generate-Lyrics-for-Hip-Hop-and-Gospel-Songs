I've been trying to find the right words 
 But they always seem to hit the page wrong 
 You see I tend to fight words 
 You breathe 'em into life, and they're gone 
 I need some louder speaking actions 
 They do what letters could never do 
 You see, you are my addiction 
 I need more than words to show you 
 So listen to me, so listen 
 Listen to my heartbeat 
 I'd like to think you understand me 
 But I never really like to assume 
 So you never have to ask me 
 I'mma let my actions tell you the tru-hu-huth 
 For you-hu-hu-hu 
 There is nothing I wouldn't go through-hu-hu-hu 
 And if you need some proo-hu-hu-oof 
 You can find it in what I do-hu-hu-hu 
 Listen to me baby 
 And I could tell you everyday 
 Just how much I want you 
 I-I-I-I I've never been good with words 
 But I went and wrote this song for you 
 So listen to me, so listen 
 Listen to my heartbeat 
 So listen to me, so listen 
 Listen to my heartbeat 
 Ba-ba-baby I need you to listen, open up your ears 
 Pay attention, let go of your fears 
 I'm not trying to be that dude that got these people in your business 
 I'm just trying to love you, can I get a witness? Oh 
 Le le le le le let the church say amen! (amen) 
 'Cause I know that you need a man! (a man) 
 And I'm gon' do whatever I can 
 So stop with all the dissin' 
 Get to the kissin' 
 Baby you know whatchu missin'! 
 So listen to me, so listen 
 Listen to my heartbeat 
 So listen to me, so listen 
 Listen to my heartbeat 
 Listen to my heartbeat 
 Listen to my heartbeat
