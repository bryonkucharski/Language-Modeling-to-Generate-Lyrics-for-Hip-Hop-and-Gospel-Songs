Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Oh yeah, (oh yeah) 
 Oh yeah, (ooh yeah) 
 May I? (May I?) 
 May I? yeah 
 May I? May I? (ooh yeah) 
 All I wanna say is may I have this dance (have this dance baby) 
 Because I only got one last chance 
 And I ain't talking 'bout the rapper I'm just dapper in here 
 When I'm dabbing on these hoes, I say what's happenin' in here 
 You ain't gotta like me to sit on my lap up in here 
 You ain't gotta like me baby but you gonna ride the wave 
 And I'm cool, old school, you so dope 
 So fly, no lie, and you know 
 Oh God I gotta feelin' that I'm 'bout to need a IV real quick 
 She ain't got to be DeJ Loaf to come and try me real quick 
 I do anything you want, I might just give this lil bitch one more chance 
 Now just breathe and truly 
 Just breathe, all you need is one last chance 
 So may I have this dance? 
 'Cause I, all I got one last chance 
 So just breathe 
 Oh yeah, T-Pain, let me explain 
 I couldn't help it, but I saw you walking into the room 
 You won't find me, and I caught a whiff of your sweet perfume 
 And you got me feeling like I wanna be in the groove 
 But I gotta stay focused on what I came to do 
 But my train of thought came rolling right back to you 
 You and me on that dance floor, baby come through 
 Touch me, let's get close 
 'Cause girl I want to show you a good time 
 If you wanna know what I'm feeling for you 
 Come on, come on, come on, come on 
 Let's dance, 'cause all you need is one more chance 
 Ooh baby, may I? 
 Oh me, one more chance 
 Ooh baby, may I have this dance? 
 'Cause I only got one last chance 
 May I have this dance? 
 'Cause I only got one chance (yeah, ooh) 
 One chance (yeah, ooh) 
 One chance (yeah, ooh) 
 One chance 
 One chance 
 One chance 
 Ooh yeah 
 Play on playa, play on playa, play on playa 
 Play on playa, play on playa, play on playa 
 Play on playa, play on playa, play on playa 
 Play on playa, play on playa, play on playa 
 May I have this dance 'cause I only have this one chance 
 May I have this dance 'cause I only got this one chance 
 Play on playa, play on playa, play on playa 
 Play on playa, play on playa, play on playa
