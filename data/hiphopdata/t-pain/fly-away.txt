I wish I can grow some wings 
 And get up out of this situation 
 I do it with no hesitation, yeah 
 I wish I can know those things 
 That everybody else knows 
 It's my decision, don't need permission to 
 Fly away (way), fly away (way) 
 I go through this everyday 
 So why fly away (way) 
 I can fly away (way), fly away (way) 
 No one listen to what I say 
 So why fly away 
 Somebody told me (told me), today was my day (day) 
 They see me on the big screen and they see me on the stage 
 And it must be true, 'Cause, here I am, here I am baby 
 I wanna thank you 
 Let me fly away (way) 
 Fly away (way), fly away (way) 
 And I go through this everyday 
 So why fly away (way) 
 I can fly away (way), fly away (way) 
 I go through this everyday 
 So why fly away (way) 
 And I go through this everyday 
 So why fly away, fly away yeah 
 Fly way yeah 
 No one listen to what I say 
 So why fly away (way) [Repeat]
