 My girl got a big ol' booty (hey) 
 Your girl got a lil ol' booty (hey) 
 Oh no 
 Oye shawty what's happening 
 Girl let's get this thing cracking 
 You just bend it on over 
 I'll get behind and you begin winding 
 (Repeat: x4) 
 Jump in the line 
 Shake your body on mine 
 Baby, let me see you 
 Shake, shake, shake, Señora, shake it left and right, right 
 Work, work, work, Señora, right into my ride 
 Miami is in the house without a doubt 
 I am the chico with clout that they yap about 
 I am from a city where the women are real 
 Bodies are great, thirty six, twenty four, thirty eight 
 But their body parts fake 
 Philly, Cali, I run through your mami 
 And the ass was off the chain 
 I hit that thing so hard she called four one one pain 
 Oye shawty what's happening 
 Girl let's get this thing cracking 
 You just bend it on over 
 I'll get behind and you begin winding 
 (Repeat: x4) 
 Jump in the line 
 Shake your body on mine 
 Baby, let me see you 
 Shake, shake, shake, Señora, shake it left and right, right 
 Work, work, work, Señora, right into my ride 
 Miami is in the house without a doubt 
 I am the chico with clout that they yap about 
 Everything's a lie that they rap about 
 Don't believe me? Check their bank accounts 
 Been around the world, like the sun 
 And seen more breasts than your new born son 
 Mami's ass is off the chain 
 I'ma hit it so hard she gon' call four one one pain 
 Oye shawty what's happening 
 Girl let's get this thing cracking 
 You just bend it on over 
 I'll get behind and you begin winding 
 (Repeat: x4) 
 Jump in the line 
 Shake your body on mine 
 Baby, let me see you 
 Shake, shake, shake, Señora, shake it left and right, right 
 Work, work, work, Señora, right into my ride 
 (Repeat: x4)

 Five lil six, lil seven lil oh 
 Oye shawty what's happening 
 Girl let's get this thing cracking 
 You just bend it on over 
 I'll get behind and you begin winding 
 (Repeat: x4) 
 Give it to me, dame mama

 Shake, shake, shake, Señora, shake it left and right, right 
 Work, work, work, Señora, right into my ride
