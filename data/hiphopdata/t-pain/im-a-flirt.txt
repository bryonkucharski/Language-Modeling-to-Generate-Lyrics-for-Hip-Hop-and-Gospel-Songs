(I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a) flirt 
 Soon as I see her walk up in the club (I'm a flirt) 
 Winkin eyes at me, when I roll up on them dubs (I'm a flirt) 
 Sometimes when I'm with my chick on the low (I'm a flirt) 
 And when she's wit her man looking at me, damn right (I'm a flirt) 
 So homie don't bring your girl to meet me 'cause (I'm a flirt) 
 And baby don't bring your girlfriend to eat 'cause (I'm a flirt) 
 Please believe it, unless your game is tight and you trust her 
 Then don't bring her around me 'cause (I'm a flirt) 
 Now swear to tell the truth 
 And the whole truth 
 When it comes to hoes I be pimping like I supposed to 
 Rolling like I supposed to 
 Shining like I supposed to 
 In the club, f***ing with honeys like I supposed to 
 I don't understand it when a n**** bring his girlfriend to club 
 Freaking all on the floor with his girlfriend in the club 
 And wondering why all these players trying to holla at her 
 Just soon as she go to the bathroom, n**** I'm gonna holla at her 
 A dog on the prowl when I'm walking through the mall 
 If I could man I probably would flirt with all of you 
 Yeah, yeah homie you say she's your girlfriend 
 But when I step up to her I'm gonna be like, "cousin" 
 Believe me man, this is how them players do it in the chi 
 And plus we got them playerette flirters in the chi 
 Now the moral of the story is cuff your b**** 
 'Cause hey I'm black, handsome, I sing plus I'm rich and (I'm a flirt) 
 (I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a) 
 Hey homie, if you ain't getting no money 
 You better keep her away from me your dig. 
 Well if you love you girl 
 And wanna keep you girl 
 Don't be walking up and asking me to meet you girl 
 Because I'm well enough a flirt when I speak to girl 
 She winked her eyes on the slide 
 I've seen you girl 
 Better treat your girl right 
 'Cause another man will 
 Better eat you girl like another man will 
 'Cause you leave your wife 
 And I see you wife 
 That be for real 
 How long you think that's finna be you wife 
 Well I'm living the life 
 You just getting it right 
 Your old lady look at me 
 'Cause you ain't hitting it right 
 She probably used to like you 
 'Cause you're the bitter type 
 That's until I came along 
 And put some dick in her life 
 Wanna see how that ass looking thick in the light 
 I noticed she was checking me 
 And digging the ice 
 And if I get that tonight 
 Better hit that twice 
 I can even make her mine 
 If I hit that price 
 You know smack that thing 
 Sit that right 
 Up on that dresser 
 Yeah that's right 
 Pulling on her hair 
 Like we getting in a fight 
 Yeah I know it's kinda tight 
 But it'll suit 'er just right 
 So if yo girl sexy 
 And she test me 
 Don't be upset g 
 'Cause you might catch me 
 Trying to catch a glance up her skirt 
 The McLaren in reverse 
 Then if I see her and I like her then I'm a flirt 
 (When I, when I, when I, when I) pull up to club 
 All the shawties be like (damn twenty-eight, eights) 
 Then I be like girl you know just who I am (don't hate, hate) 
 Say I done fell in love wit a stripper you all 
 All I do is flirt with her, and I get them draws 
 And I don't need no help, I got it down pact 
 Teddy paine was born to flirt now you can't down that 
 Now I'm flirt with her whether I'm in or out of town 
 That's why they call me teddy bend her ass down
