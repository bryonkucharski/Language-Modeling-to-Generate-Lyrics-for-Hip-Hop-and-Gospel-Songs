(Rapping: T-Pain) 
 Man I been gone for way to long 
 When I come back I snap on niggas 
 Deficatition is an assessity 
 I had to crap on niggas 
 And it's not even the trust nigga my daddy told me too 
 You can lay in yo bed scared of what them Nappy Boys would do 
 I was planning taking a break 
 But you niggas done brought me out 
 You was making songs like crazy 
 Now it's a musicial drought 
 Now I got them versions on the lowest price around 
 Hundred thousand dollars for that T-Pain's sound (T-Pain's sound) 
 (Hook: Karaoke Sample) 
 Why you wanna do some shit I did in '03? 
 But don't act like you know... 
 I'm laying low key 
 Grab ya microphone 
 Set yo auto tune 
 And I'm a bust a verse on yo ass like I outta do 
 I got up out da streets so I ain't gotta steal 
 But listen to the radio it's obvious I still kill 
 Grab ya microphone 
 Set yo auto tune 
 And I'm a bust a verse on yo ass like I outta do
