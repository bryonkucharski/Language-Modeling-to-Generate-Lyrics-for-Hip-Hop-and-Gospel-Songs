 T-Pain, Mr. Worldwide 
 Not you, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 It's not you, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, not you 
 I know I be, I be, I be 
 All up in these clubs clubs 
 Playin' with these girls girls 
 Travelin' around the world 
 I know, I be, I be, I be 
 Messin' with your feelin's 
 Money to the ceiling 
 It falls down to the floor 
 I know, I'll be 
 Fist pump, fist pump 
 Fist pumpin' like a champ, yeah 
 The music got me amped, yeah 
 I'm catchin' leg cramps 
 I know I be, I be 
 Messin' us up 
 And that's all that I do 
 So if we break up 
 I can tell you it's not you, not you 
 It's not you, not you, it's me 
 And I know I be trippin', trippin' 
 But I need you to listen 
 It's not you, not you 
 It's not you, not you it's me 
 Even though I'm messin' up 
 I can't stay out of this club 
 It's not you

 It's not you, it's me 
 Baby, it's not you, it's me 
 It's not you, it's me 
 Baby, it's not you, it's me 
 It's not you, it's me 
 Baby, it's not you, it's me 
 It's the dog in me 
 I know we be, we be 
 Kissin' all in public public 
 And girl, I love it, love it 
 Can't get enough of it 
 But girl, lately, lately 
 You been talkin' down, down 
 Keep me with a frown, frown 
 I can't keep you around 
 I know I be 
 Fist pump, fist pump 
 Fist pumpin' like a pro 
 Girl, you already know 
 You've seen me do this before 
 I know I be messin' us up 
 But you can't tell me what to do 
 So if we break up 
 I can tell you it's not you, not you 
 It's not you, not you, it's me 
 And I know, I be trippin' trippin' 
 But I need you to listen 
 It's not you, not you

 It's not you, it's me 
 Baby, it's not you, it's me 
 Woo 
 They slip, I grip, she dip, I dip 
 I hit, no text, no twitter 
 That girl's so bad, that thing so thick 
 And 'Pain, you can bet I get her 
 Even the girls wanna hit her 
 (All right) 
 So you know, I'm gonna take one with her 
 (For sho) 
 More for Voli, pour it like water, let's go 
 For sho fill the club like New Orleans 
 She this, she that, her ass so fat 
 And her kitty cat's down for a doggin' 
 Mira mamita, verdad que tu esta linda, rica y donita 
 Pero la verde que quiero tu amiguita 
 It's not you, it's me, I'm sorry, Dale 
 So if we break up 
 I can tell you it's not you, not you 
 It's not you, not you, it's me 
 And I know I be trippin', trippin'
