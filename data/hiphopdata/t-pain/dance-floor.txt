(T-Pain) 
 I got the hat, I got the shoes, I got the outfit 
 I go outside and pick the right I'm gon' go out with 
 But right before I hit the streets 
 I gotta put on my dancing shoes in the mirror 
 (T-Pain) 
 The hat, rock with it, rock with it 
 The hat, step with it, step with it 
 The hat, slide with it, slide with it 
 The hat, ride with it, ride with it 
 The hat, walk with it, walk with it 
 The hat, get low 
 The hat, and I know where I'm 'bout to go 
 (Chorus: T-Pain) 
 I'll be on the dance floor 
 Don't be tricky with me 
 Sorry I was in the corner, now she's looking for me 
 I'll be on the dance floor 
 That's what I do 
 In a minute I'll be in it and I'm tricking with you 
 I'll be on the dance floor 
 Don't be tricky with me 
 Sorry I was in the corner, now she's looking for me 
 I'll be on the dance floor 
 That's what I do 
 In a minute I'll be in it and I'm tricking with you 
 On the dance floor 
 (T-Pain) 
 I hit the club and I'm ready for a dance hall (a dance hall) 
 Mr. Dizm 'bout to blow a nigga pants off (his pants off) 
 So if he wanna ride with me 
 I'm 'bout to do the same thing that I be in the mirror 
 (T-Pain) 
 The hat, rock with it, rock with it 
 The hat, step with it, step with it 
 The hat, slide with it, slide with it 
 The hat, ride with it, ride with it 
 The hat, walk with it, walk with it 
 The hat, get low 
 The hat, and I know where I'm 'bout to go 
 (Chorus: T-Pain) 
 I'll be on the dance floor 
 Don't be tricky with me 
 Sorry I was in the corner, now she's looking for me 
 I'll be on the dance floor 
 That's what I do 
 In a minute I'll be in it and I'm tricking with you 
 I'll be on the dance floor 
 Don't be tricky with me 
 Sorry I was in the corner, now she's looking for me 
 I'll be on the dance floor 
 That's what I do 
 In a minute I'll be in it and I'm tricking with you 
 On the dance floor 
 (Tay Dizm) 
 Ey this is Yo' boy Tay Dizm 
 You know what I'm saying 
 That kunamattata you know 
 Ey, I'm doing this here for the south 
 You know what I'm saying 
 My nigga Pain 
 And I told y'all niggas before he dropped this 
 'Cause anything we touch we know it would be the shit 
 Like an old school body that's good all out 
 From the grill to the paint to the dog in the back to the jump off 
 And if he's not gonna set it off, hit the club (?) 
 And who's step up to my crew, then this is what my crew gon' do my nigga 
 (T-Pain) 
 The hat, rock with it, rock with it 
 The hat, step with it, step with it 
 The hat, slide with it, slide with it 
 The hat, ride with it, ride with it 
 The hat, walk with it, walk with it 
 The hat, get low 
 The hat, and I know where I'm 'bout to go 
 (Chorus: T-Pain) 
 I'll be on the dance floor 
 Don't be tricky with me 
 Sorry I was in the corner, now she's looking for me 
 I'll be on the dance floor 
 That's what I do 
 In a minute I'll be in it and I'm tricking with you 
 I'll be on the dance floor 
 Don't be tricky with me 
 Sorry I was in the corner, now she's looking for me 
 I'll be on the dance floor 
 That's what I do 
 In a minute I'll be in it and I'm tricking with you 
 On the dance floor
