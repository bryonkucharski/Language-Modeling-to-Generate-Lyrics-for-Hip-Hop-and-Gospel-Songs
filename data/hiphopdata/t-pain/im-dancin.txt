 And dancing dancing 
 Do you wanna party? 
 Do you wanna go home?

 Do you want me? 
 'Cause I want you 
 To the back of the club 
 Shorty what we're gonna do? 
 Please don't hurt me 
 Baby keep flirting 
 Just be my girl tonight 
 Shorty doing that bang 
 She's looking at me 
 She might hurt me 
 Baby keep flirting 
 Just be my girl tonight
