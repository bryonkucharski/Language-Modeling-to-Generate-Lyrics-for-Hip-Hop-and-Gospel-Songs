We would always have the ability to start off right (right) 
 By the end of the night we end up in a fight (whoa) 
 Girl you said you'd never leave me, but you might 
 This time, this time, this time 
 We was doing so damn good for so damn long 
 But as you can see something went terribly wrong (whoa) 
 I been through this so I can stay strong 
 This time, this time, this time 
 Separated, separated, separated, separated 
 Cause yesterday was cool and the day before 
 But tomorrow will never be no more of 
 Separated 
 Cause yesterday was cool and the day before 
 But tomorrow will never be no more of 
 Separated 
 We would always have the ability to pull it back together (gether, gether, gether) 
 And you was always down for me, you ain't give a fungress to whateva (evaaa...) 
 But now you're here telling me that you deserve betta 
 This time, this time (this time) 
 Hey, and now I'm sitting here in the dark with nobody 
 And I don't wanna be alone I need my shawty 
 Cause luxury means nothing without the luxury of love 
 We're separated, separated, separated, separated 
 Cause yesterday was cool and the day before 
 But tomorrow there will be no more of 
 Separated

 But tomorrow there will be no more of (hoo hoo ooh)
