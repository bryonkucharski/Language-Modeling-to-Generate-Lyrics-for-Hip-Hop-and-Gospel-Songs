I still don't know what she put in my mind 
 But I want it gone 
 Immediately 
 She makes me think I need her all the time 
 Oh baby no 
 She needed me 
 The rules don't apply to her (ooh) 
 I knew I was blind to her and all she's done to me 
 The rules don't apply to her (oh-oh) 
 She makes me think I need her all the time 
 Oh baby no 
 She needed me 
 (Hey, hey) 
 I need her all the time 
 Oh baby no 
 She needed me 
 (Hey, hey) 
 I need her all the time 
 Oh baby no 
 She needed me 
 Me and you are so through I can't go on 
 I want you gone 
 I'm believing in me 
 (Hey) 
 She makes me feel like I did something to her so wrong 
 Oh baby no 
 You cheated me 
 You know the dudes always fly to her 
 (Oh) 
 I knew I was blind to her and all she's done to me 
 The rules don't apply to her 
 (Oh) 
 She makes me think I need her all the time 
 Oh baby no 
 She needed me 
 (Hey, hey) 
 I need her all the time 
 Oh baby no 
 She needed me 
 (Hey, hey) 
 I need her all the time 
 Oh baby no 
 She needed me 
 Who would've thought that I would have to get rid of you like I did 
 It's hurting me but it ain't hurt you (you, you, you) 
 But I know you're not worth it (worth it) 
 I know you don't deserve anything I got 
 Yeah 
 So come on baby let me help you pick up all your clothes 
 And come on baby let me help you get outta my door 
 'Cause she makes me think I need her in my life 
 Oh baby no 
 She needed me 
 (Hey, hey) 
 I need her all the time 
 Oh baby no 
 She needed me 
 (Hey, hey) 
 I need her all the time 
 Oh baby no 
 She needed me
