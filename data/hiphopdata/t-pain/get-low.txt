 Boots with the fur (With the fur)

 I ain't never seen nothin' that'll make me go, 
 This crazy all night spendin my dough 
 Had a million dollar vibe and a bottle to go 
 Dem birthday cakes, they stole the show 
 So sexual, she was flexible 
 Professional, drinkin' X and ooh 
 Hold up wait a minute, do I see what I think I 
 Whoa 
 Did I think I seen shorty get low 
 Ain't the same when it's up that close 
 Make it rain, I'm makin' it snow 
 Work the pole, I got the bank roll 
 Imma say that I prefer them no clothes 
 I'm into that, I love women exposed 
 She threw it back at me, I gave her more 
 Cash ain't a problem, I know where it goes

 Hey 
 Shawty what I gotta do to get you home 
 My jeans full of gwap 
 And they ready for Shones 
 Cadillacs Maybachs for the sexy grown 
 Patrone on the rocks that'll make you moan 
 One stack (come on) 
 Two stacks (come on) 
 Three stacks (come on, now that's three grand) 
 What you think I'm playin' baby girl 
 I'm the man, I'll bend the rubber bands 
 That's what I told her, her legs on my shoulder 
 I knew it was ova, that Henny and Cola 
 Got me like a Soldier 
 She ready for Rover, I couldn't control her 
 So lucky ooh me, I was just like a clover 
 Shorty was hot like a toaster 
 Sorry but I had to fold her, 
 Like a pornography poster 
 She showed her

 Lil mama took my cash, 
 And I ain't want it back, 
 The way she bit that rag, 
 Got her them paper stacks, 
 Tattoo of bubba cray,

 She wouldn't stop, made it drop 
 Shorty did that pop and lock, 
 Had to break her off that gwap 
 Gah it was fly just like my glock
