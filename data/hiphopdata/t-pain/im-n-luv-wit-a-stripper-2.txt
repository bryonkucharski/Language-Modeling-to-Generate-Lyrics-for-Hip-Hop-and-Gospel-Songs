T-Pain 
 God damn lil' mama, you ain't heard the remix yet 
 Twista, Paul Wall, Pimp C, MJG, Too $hort, come on baby 
 She got the body of a goddess, everybody know that 
 Super-cute face and the booty so fat 
 I'm in the club dropping twenty-four stacks 
 'Cause I'm in love and that's a well known fact 
 Like, yeah she know what she doing 
 If a nigga chillin' with a stripper then he never go back home 
 She got eyes butter pecan brown can't leave it alone 
 Liking the way she break it down to the flo' 
 Need to get her over here show her where 
 It's about to go down right now 
 I'm in love with a stripper 
 Twista 
 You wanna know where Twista be on fifty 
 T-Pain invited me to Magic City 
 I'm about to have some fun 2001, in these pocket all my e-fizzles with me 
 I like the way mama get up on the table 
 I like the way she pour the honey in her naval 
 I like it when she smack her fatty and open it up in front of me 
 I wanna touch it but I ain't able 
 The one leg she can shake at the top of the pole 
 Look at the laffy taffy when she pop, she roll 
 I wanna get her in the bed right after they close 
 When I do a video you get the popular role 
 In the V.I.P. they get a lil' lap dance 
 Come and grind on the willy of a black man 
 In my ear tellin' me the shit a nigga like to hear 
 While I nibble on ya nipple like Pac-Man 
 She freakin' she lickin' she rubbin' 
 Then she pulled my dick out and start suckin' 
 All because I be the Twista 
 Even though T-Pain told me shorty was a freak 
 I asked her can I take her home (Down right now)

 Pimp C 
 Uh, young Pimp C 
 I'm a P-I-M-P, trickin' ain't in my pedigree 
 It really ain't 'bout no square love it's strictly 'cause she payin' me 
 She be wantin' lay me but I can't do too much of that 
 'Cause even though yo ass fat, freakin' off ain't where it's at 
 But I can show you how to get out there and get it 
 You love yo daddy I know ya with it 
 That's why I got love for you 
 'Cause you get out there and do what it do 
 Workin' my piece and work the pole 
 Break the trick you gotta pay to roll 
 Get the money break 'em off 
 And we in the Benz and we scratchin' off 
 Paul Wall 
 It was love at first sight when I seen that ass shakin' 
 And bout fifty dollars later it was love in our makin' 
 Ya simply won my heart when I saw the way ya work that pole 
 And when you bent over ya had my wallet in a choke hold 
 I saw you in your birthday suit and and baby it was fate 
 When you give me a lap dance it's like we gone on a date 
 But I feel like ya cheatin' on me when I see ya dancin' with other guys 
 I'm runnin' low on ones, I can't lie I'm in love baby

 R. Kelly 
 I must be the first man to ever fall in love with an ass 
 Gonna bend down on my knees and ask that ass to marry me 
 That booty makes forget about the chicks I been with in the past 
 'Cause we got a lot in common she's a stripper I'm a freak 
 Makes me wanna grab it I have a habit, I gotta have it 
 They call me the man of steel cause yo ass is like a magnet 
 Damn you got me so in love, can't stay away from this club 
 Every time I find my self rollin' up on them dubs 
 I've been around the world, seen booty all of the time 
 Never seen booty, so so pretty, so so fine 
 Comin' down the pole, no secret why I'm here 
 Girl you keep donk on swole, with a drop drop with it 
 Drop pop with it the way you doing that thang with it don't you 
 Stop with it, I wanna stick it, wanna kiss it if I could I'd put my whole damn head in it, 
 I'm in love with a stripper 
 MJG 
 I'm in love with a stripper, I need to get some stripper counselin' 
 'Cause I'm the first one in the front row when they make a stripper announcement 
 I think I'm fallin' in love with the one with the most ass 
 Thin, lil' bitty waist, I'ma go and buy that bitch a Volkswagen 
 MJG, pimp tight, no mo' tippin' stop the bill 
 If I come in here one mo' night I'm gon' need Dr. Phil 
 But I'm a G, I'll step back and tell them bitches outright 
 Ain't no way I can turn a stripper into a housewife 
 Too $hort 
 The last girl was pretty but she wasn't fine as you 
 She sexy but she couldn't do the thangs you do 
 She could dance but nothin' like the way you move 
 I used to want her until the day I saw you 
 I'm a grown ass man I thought I seen it all 
 Doin' all that on the pole and didn't even fall 
 And right then I knew exactly what it was (What's that) 
 I wanna fuck the baddest bitch in the club
