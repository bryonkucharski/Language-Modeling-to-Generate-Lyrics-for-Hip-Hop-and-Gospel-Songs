The world keeps spinnin, with or without me 
 And I know, that's hard to believe 
 And now I'm in a box, with nothin' around me 
 'Cause I found a girl that'll get on her knees (at ease) 
 And all the while I'm knowin' that my homies will clown me 
 'Cause I fucked her and didn't have a rubber on me 
 It seems I had to find out the hard way 
 That the girl that I found in the ground, she had HIV 
 Now she next to me like 
 Lalala lala la lalala (suicide) 
 Lalala lala la lalala (suicide) 
 Lalala lala la lalala (suicide) 
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 million ways, to leave this whole wide world so cold 
 Stuck on my ass I been drinkin' for days 
 And I got the nerve to put that Bonneville on the road 
 Got that thang on me and a couple kilos 
 A bag of ecstasy and a pound of that dro (whoa) 
 But I guess I had to find out the hard way 
 'Cause I done came to the end of the road 
 Now I'm in the mirror like 
 Lalala lala la lalala (suicide) 
 Lalala lala la lalala (suicide) 
 Lalala lala la lalala (suicide) 
 Lalala lala la lalala 
 Lalala lala la lalala 
 Lalala lala la lalala
