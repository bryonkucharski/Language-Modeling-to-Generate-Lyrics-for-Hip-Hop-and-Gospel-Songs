Yeah 
 How many times have I told you love you? 
 Don't seem to change a thing 
 Girl you're not the same 
 There was a time when you want me to hug you 
 And treat you like the lady that you wanna be 
 But girl I knew that one in me 
 Would never try to hold me back 
 And do me all this wrong, girl what's going on? 
 I tried to talk and you walk away 
 Right of my face, right out of my place 
 But... 
 That's just it girl 
 You just don't know how much I love you now 
 That you walked out of my house 
 That's just it girl 
 Would it be another day, be another way 
 To get you right back in my place 
 That's just it girl 
 You just don't know how much I love you now 
 That you walked out of my house 
 That's just it girl 
 Would it be another day, be another way 
 To get you right back in my place 
 How many times have sat at the table? 
 And both ate one time and said what's on our mind 
 I'm thinking of a relationship was a fable 
 A fairytale of me, that's just how it seems (oh girl, I heard) 
 Even when I heard that you were cheating, I was faithful 
 And would do any goddamn that you would say too 
 I tried to talk and you walk away 
 Right out of my face, right out of my place 
 But... 
 That's just it girl 
 You just don't know how much I love you now 
 That you walked out of my house 
 That's just it girl 
 Would it be another day, be another way 
 To get you right back in my place 
 That's just it girl 
 You just don't know how much I love you now 
 You walked out of my house 
 That's just it girl 
 Would it be another day, be another way 
 To get you right back in my place 
 That's just it girl 
 Oh you just don't know how much I love you now 
 That you walked out of my house 
 That's just it girl 
 Would it be another day, be another way 
 To get you right back in my place 
 That's just it girl 
 Oh you just don't know how much I love you now 
 You walked out of my house 
 That's just it girl 
 Would it be another day, be another way 
 To get you right back in my place
