You ain't gotta watch your kids 
 You can get your nails did

 And I can open up the doors 
 You can put on your clothes 
 And watch your behavior 
 Because I'm gonna save you girl 
 Now go and find you a rich white man 
 And maybe he can pay you 
 It might be minimum wage but 
 It's okay 'cause you're a new girl 
 And ain't nobody go beyond the mic

 From this moment on baby you're my girl 
 And this those goes out to all struggling strippers in the world
