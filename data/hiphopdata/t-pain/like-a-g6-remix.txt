Poppin' bottles in the ice, like a blizzard 
 When we drink we do it right gettin' slizzard 
 Sippin sizzurp in my ride, like Three 6 
 Now you bitches are in tune to the T-Mix 
 Like a G6, Like a G6 
 Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6 
 Like a G6, Like a G6 
 Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6 
 (T-Pain) 
 I'm high as a bird 
 If you say you saw me and I wasn't fly that's absurd 
 A thousand on the jeans and a solid five on the shirt 
 You see me, you need me in the game 
 I already know they gon' hate 
 But that's when I drop that (808) 
 Come on I ain't playin' with them 
 I make hits, I'm gone, I ain't stayin' with 'em 
 A G6 I'm on when I land in it 
 Ya get shit, ya don't understand nigga 
 Somebody come give me a high five 
 Something to keep my eyes wide 
 No it ain't no stoppin' we get pop pop poppin' 
 Poppin' bottles in the ice, like a blizzard 
 When we drink we do it right gettin' slizzard 
 Sippin sizzurp in my ride, like Three 6 
 Like a G6, Like a G6 
 Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6 
 Like a G6, Like a G6 
 Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6 
 Sippin on, sippin on sizz, Ima ma-make it fizz 
 Girl I keep it gangsta, poppin' bottles at the crib 
 This is how we live, every single night 
 Take that bottle to the head, and let me see you fly 
 (808) Hell Yeaa 
 Drink it up, drink-drink it up, 
 When sober girls around me, they be actin' like they drunk 
 They be actin' like they drunk, actin-actin' like they drunk 
 When sober girls around me actin-actin' like they drunk 
 Poppin' bottles in the ice, like a blizzard 
 When we drink we do it right gettin' slizzard 
 Sippin sizzurp in my ride, like Three 6 
 Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6 
 Like a G6, Like a G6 
 Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6 
 It's that 808 bump, make you put yo hands up 
 Make you put yo hands up, put yo, put yo hands up 
 (You can't Touch this) 
 It's that 808 bump, make you put yo hands up 
 Make you put yo hands up, put yo, put yo hands up 
 (You can't Touch this) 
 Hell Yeaaa, Make you put yo hands up, put yo put yo hands up 
 Hell Yeaaa, Make you put yo hands up, put yo put yo hands up 
 Poppin' bottles in the ice, like a blizzard 
 When we drink we do it right gettin' slizzard 
 Sippin sizzurp in my ride, like Three 6 
 Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6 
 Like a G6, Like a G6 
 Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
