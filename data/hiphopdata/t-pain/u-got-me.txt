(Feat. Akon) 
 New York City 
 All in Los Angeles California 
 From the drive lanes to the open seas baby 
 To all my beautiful ladies 
 (Akon) 
 (I see) 
 The first thing I noticed when I walked in the club girl was you watching me (me, me, me) 
 Then I started walking to here when I lost her in the crown, where could she be? (be, be, be) 
 You got me in the middle of the dance floor, just searching for you girl 
 I'm steady looking for you baby 
 I ask my myself where you created in this world, by the beauty in you girl 
 And I can't believe that you got me 
 (Chorus: Akon) 
 You got me so, you got me so 
 You got me so high and confused 
 I don't know what to do 
 So, you got me so 
 You got me so high and confused 
 I don't know what to do 
 (T-Pain) 
 Now you got me all in the club like I ain't got none better to do than look for you (you, you) 
 Yeah 
 'Cause I'll be all night searching, do what I gotta do till I find you (you, you) 
 You got me in the middle of the dance floor, just searching for you girl 
 (I said I'm searching for you girl) 
 You got me sweating, got me weak in the knee 
 'Cause I've been working for you girl 
 It's so hard because I'm so... 
 (Chorus: Akon & T-Pain) 
 You got me so, you got me so 
 You got me so high and confused (so high and confused) 
 I don't know what to do (don't know what to do) 
 So, you got me so 
 You got me so high and confused 
 I don't know what to do (don't know what to do) 
 (Akon) 
 Now I'm looking in the back while I'm looking in the front 
 While I'm standing in the middle like where are you? (Are you, are you) 
 I couldn't sworn that she walked right past me baby 
 Make her sip on jack and tack 
 And the blunt got me looking at ladies, where are you? (Are you) 
 I couldn't sworn that she look right at me 
 'Cause I'm looking for you 
 You got me in the middle of the dance floor, just searching for you girl 
 And I'm tryna find you baby 
 I ask my myself where you created in this world, by the beauty in you girl 
 The beauty got me going crazy 
 Come on and find me 
 (Chorus: Akon) 
 You got me so, you got me so 
 You got me so high and confused 
 I don't know what to do 
 So, you got me so 
 You got me so high and confused 
 I don't know what to do 
 Don't know if I can go on through this night without you
