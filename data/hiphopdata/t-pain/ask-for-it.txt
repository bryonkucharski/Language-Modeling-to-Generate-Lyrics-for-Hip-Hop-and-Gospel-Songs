"Ask For It" 
 Nivea: 
 La la la la la la la la la la ooh 
 T-Pain: 
 It's been two months and twenty days the last time I laid my eyes on you 
 (And I'm sick and tired) of not being around you 
 (And I'm sick and tired) of not seeing your face 
 And baby I kknow that it's killin' you too 
 I can hear it in your voice when I'm talkin' to you 
 (On the phone late at night) My conclusion is 
 (Being alone ain't right) I'm so confused babe 
 Cause some nights I cry thinkin' about you babe, can't do without you babe 
 Please believe me 
 ThatI got this thang covered, you ain't never gotta worry 'bout nothing 
 So baby please tell me 
 If there's anything you want 
 Anything you need 
 There ain't nothing in this world you cannot have 
 All you gotta do is ask for it 
 All you gotta do is ask for it [x2] 
 Nivea: 
 Many nights I cried thinkin' about you boy 
 I been dreamin' about you boy 
 Now we're separated boy 
 It's one thing to say but you gotta show you love me 
 'Cause it's fifteen minutes after three and I'm still waiting to see 
 I-I-I I'm so tired of it boy 
 I-I-I done everything I could for sure 
 It's so long and I'm so gone and I know you niss me 
 I'll be out the door, ain't coming back no more 
 No I don't wanna speak to you... you, you, you 
 I did anything for you babe, everything for you babe 
 Used to say that I had you sprung 
 Used to treat me like number one 
 I guess I'll give you another chance 
 You better not pull that shit again 
 If there's anything you want 
 Anything you need 
 There ain't nothing in this world you cannot have 
 All you gotta do is ask for it 
 All you gotta do is ask for it [x4]
