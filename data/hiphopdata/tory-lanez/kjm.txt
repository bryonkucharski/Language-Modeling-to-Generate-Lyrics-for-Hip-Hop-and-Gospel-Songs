Tory 
 I'm so tired of you niggas 
 Got it on smash! 
 You and all these bitches that be lyin' in ya pictures 
 I'ma take a jet and I'ma fly my niggas 
 Somewhere so big I can't find my niggas 
 Ayy, and I'm trying my nigga 
 But you making hard to be around y'all niggas 
 And this is why I only be around my niggas 
 Come around I gotta look you up and down my nigga 
 I can't be around you fuck niggas, that just ain't me 
 Had to check myself, uh, I'm the same me 
 And I bust it like the clip when it's off safety, don't make me 
 And them fuck-boy hatin' niggas tryna replace me 
 'Cause I give them boys the blues like I'm a Grape Street G 
 And no, got no Gucci on me but I just stay GG'd 
 And when I pop up and hop to the mall I spend like 18 Gs on nothing 
 She ride me like a ATV 
 I keep her Dolce-Gabbana'd up so she can stay DG'd 
 And I swear that batty so big that I can't stay PG 
 But I stay all up on your block just like the state PD 
 You know I cross my I's and I just dot my T's 
 And I just hang with the same niggas from all my team 
 When I come up I promise we gonna ball together 
 'Cause when we came up from nothing we was all together 
 I'm talking, all together, we was all together 
 When we came up from nothing, we was all together 
 When we all together, we was all together 
 When we came up from nothing, we was all together, yeah 
 And I can't let no money get between us 
 And I can't let no bitches get between us 
 Gotta stack this money with my team (ayy, he knows) 
 All together, all together when we 
 Came up from nothing, we just ball together 
 And we never trust these bitches that we dog together 
 Whether big or we small or we tall together, I know 
 Dog forever, that's my dog forever 
 I'm gon' ball forever, fuck these broads forever 
 I got bags of money, I can't stop forever, you see 
 One Umbrella baby we gon' star together, one time 
 Yeah, and I'm big checkin' 
 I make so many hits I'm wondering did I miss yet? 
 Did I miss yet? 
 And tell me which nigga that I sound like this time 
 I turn a four-figure to a six-figure cheque, yeah, tell me do it sound right this time? 
 When there's more niggas tryna copy me, they tryna sound bite this line 
 And these pussy-ass niggas tryna hate on me 
 I put it down right this time 
 I think it's 'bout right this time 
 I think it's about right this time 
 I'm so tired of you niggas 
 You and all these bitches that be lyin' in ya pictures 
 I'ma take a jet and I'ma fly my niggas 
 Somewhere so big I can't find my niggas
