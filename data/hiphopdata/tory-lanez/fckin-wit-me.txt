Most of us successful people could tell you a story 
 About when they wasn't fucking with us 
 Now that we at the top, y'all not fucking with us 
 They ain't fuck with me when my money low 
 Now they tryna ride cause my money long 
 These niggas ain't shit, half million dollar whip, nigga 
 Tell your bitch suck a rich nigga dick 
 They may hate like I ain't grind for this shit 
 But I ain't tripping cause you niggas ain't fucking with me 
 Tell 'em nah, nah you niggas ain't fucking with me 
 Yeah, when the money came all the hoes came too 
 These niggas started hating, I guess that's what fame do 
 And I remain who? Me! Still be with the same crew 
 None of my niggas don't fall out for bitches 
 They falling for money, we ain't you, we ain't y'all niggas 
 Started with a dollar and I turned that to a million 
 Now the chasers in the building, it ain't hard nigga 
 I'm like oh Lord what a feeling when you pull up 
 Drop the ceiling on them suckers that was watching while we starve nigga 
 They got fat and I got slim so I shitted on them niggas when I got in 
 My homie called me for some paper that was not my friend 
 That was not my dogg, so now we fuck that niggas now come on 
 More money than you can ever think 
 Now we buying more PJ than we can ever drink 
 More than we could ever swallow 
 Get money that's my motto 
 When you in the lead there's nothing to follow 
 I know... 
 These niggas ain't shit, half million dollar whip, nigga 
 Tell your bitch suck a rich nigga dick 
 They may hate like I ain't grind for this shit 
 But I ain't tripping cause you niggas ain't fucking with me 
 Tell 'em nah, nah you niggas ain't fucking with me 
 When the money came all the problems came too 
 And when the problems came all they had to blame was you 
 And niggas said I changed, you would probably change too 
 When niggas is hating they catching them vapors 
 And mad at favors that you ain't do 
 They gon' switch sides 
 I could tell you suckers want me gone 
 Before I let my mama mourn, you know I'mma let that shit fly 
 And I used to get it on 
 Selling crack till it was dawn 
 Moving fish, and I ain't talking 'bout no fish fry 
 And the reason they can't keep up, 'cause when they sleep you know we up 
 We move kilos, then re-up 
 I do one lap, then I speed up 
 With your plan A you couldn't be us 
 Or see us, when it's game time 
 And it's 4th quarter now let's D up 
 Ima be up, with my feet up 
 And Ima eat up, every beat up 
 That they feed us, as a fetus 
 I had more stripes than Adidas 
 And my dawg told me don't ease up, kill these niggas 
 And when I do murder them all me and my Philly niggas 
 These niggas ain't shit, half million dollar whip, nigga 
 Tell your bitch suck a rich nigga dick 
 They may hate like I ain't grind for this shit 
 But I ain't tripping cause you niggas ain't fucking with me 
 Tell 'em nah, nah you niggas ain't fucking with me 
 I'm on a decade of dominating the game 
 With the legends, the hottest MCs, and the new niggas 
 It's me! 
 They ain't fuckin' wit me 
 It's the ball
