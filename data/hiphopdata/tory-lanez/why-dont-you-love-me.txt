 Five bands, spending lovely 
 Wrist cuts, get you glitz'd up

 Why can't you love me?

 Yeah, count the baguettes, I need to flex 
 Need to do something to shift all the stress, yeah 
 'Cause I can't make you love, I can't make you love me 
 Damn, I wished you loved me 
 Damn, I wished you loved me 
 Wasn't it so lovely? Wasn't it so lovely? 
 When you used to love me? 
 And do you still love me? 
 Why can't you love? 
 Why don't you love me? 
 Why don't you love me? 
 Why don't you love me? 
 Why don't you love, yeah 
 Went to trenches, came back to a nigga 
 You flew away and came back to a nigga 
 You used to keep it so thorough, then when you would come around you wouldn't dab all my niggas 
 I love myself when I was in the trap 
 I love myself when I was in the trenches 
 I love my love for people when I used to see 'em walk beside 'em sleeping on the benches 
 But one day you saw me and you held me down 
 Kept it real and shawty you held it down 
 Wasn't nothin' niggas could tell me now 
 Wasn't nothin' I couldn't sell out 
 I just had to get the money and get it 
 Got the product, stack it, flip it and split it 
 With my niggas in the trenches 
 Baby, you the one that held a niggas down and I will not forget it, yeah 
 You loved, you loved me 
 You loved, you loved me 
 You loved, you loved me 
 Back to my ways, I'm going back to my ways 
 Audemar Patek the face 
 I can't go back to your place 
 It bring me back to the days 
 Back in the day 
 How the fuck you let him kiss on your face? 
 How you had him all up back in your place? 
 Had another nigga sit in my space 
 Tryna give another nigga my place, oh no 
 No, no, no, no 
 Lil' bitch
