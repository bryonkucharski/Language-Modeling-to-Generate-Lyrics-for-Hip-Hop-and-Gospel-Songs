This is just a little rap song 
 Built upon a simple note 
 Other styles are bound to follow, 
 But the root is still hiphop 
 Now this new one is the consequence 
 Of the one we've just been through 
 As I'm bound to be the unavoidable consequence of you 
 There's so many rappers who can rap and rap and rap 
 And just say nothing 
 Or really nothing 
 They have used up all the styles we know 
 And at the end we've come to nothing 
 Or nearly nothing 
 So I come back to my first note 
 As I must come back to you 
 I will pour into this one mic 
 All the love I feel for you 
 Anyone who wants the whole show 
 Let him be the one fa sho 
 He will find himself with no show 
 Better go for what you know 
 There's so many rappers who can spit and spit and spit 
 And just say nothing 
 Or really nothing 
 They have used up all the styles we know 
 And at the end we've come to nothing 
 Or nearly nada 
 So I come back to my first note 
 As I must come back to you 
 I will pour into this one mic 
 All the love I feel for you 
 Anyone who wants the whole show 
 Let him be the one fa sho 
 He will find himself with no show 
 Better go for what you know
