I hear voices in my head 
 My head hears voies 
 So many choices 
 I'm coming down off a bad trip 
 And I'm sick of the bullshit 
 It ain't my fault 
 It's all my fault 
 Who's fault is it 
 It doesn't matter 
 Can you understand 
 I live the life of a mad man 
 I'm a psycho 
 Suicidal 
 Not Michael 
 Like a motorcycle 
 I can't understand myself 
 Man I need help 
 Who am I 
 Am I 
 Who you though I was 
 It's not too bad cause 
 I ain't trippin' 
 Naw I'm trippin' 
 Cause y'all be trippin' 
 You don't know me 
 How you goin' know me 
 When I don't know me 
 I try to get to know myself 
 Self knowledge and tell myself 
 They're all gonna laugh at me 
 I gotta get my head together 
 It's the new style 
 I gotta get my head straight 
 I'm losin' my mind 
 I'm giving you a piece of my mind 
 I got something on my mind 
 One time but hey nevermind 
 I'm losin' my sense 
 I got no sence 
 No nonsense 
 More dollars than cents 
 Since I'm dyin' 
 The world may never know if I'm lyin' 
 Lying in my grave 
 Hey I think I need a shave 
 What's my name 
 Who stole my brain 
 Who should I blame 
 Blame it on the boogie 
 Blame it on the rain 
 I can feel your pain 
 I'ma say 
 Hey I forgot what I'ma say 
 Who, What, When, Where, Why, How 
 I gotta get my head together 
 I gotta get my head together 
 I gotta get my head together 
 I gotta get my head together 
 I gotta get my head together 
 I gotta get it straight 
 I gotta get it straight 
 I can't really wait 
 I can't really wait for my mind 
 Make up my mind 
 I'm losin' my mind 
 So do you mind 
 I don't mind 
 If you don't mind 
 'Cause what's yours is mine 
 But I need my own 
 You know what I'm sayin' holmes 
 You don't know 
 'Cause I don't know 
 So, kick that hey 
 My name's Esham 
 Slit your wrist 
 Drink a orange juice 
 Hellalujah 
 Suck my dick 
 What's it to ya 
 I'm from no where 
 I'm commin' straight outta' no where 
 And goin' no where 
 More broke more broke 
 More coke for the fiends to smoke 
 Come get me 
 Lock me up 
 I don't give a fuck 
 I gotta get my head together 
 Man I'm back 
 I'm the black devil 
 And it that ain't no joke 
 What's up 
 Who's playin' that beat 
 I'm commin' through in the back seat 
 Cheap shots 
 Cheap tricks 
 But you can suck on my toe 
 Hey ho you know 
 That I'm the black bro 
 I still don't know where I come from 
 Lick my balls till my dick's numb 
 Dum ditty dum ditty dum dum 
 Redrum 
 I feel like a redrum 
 E-S-H-A-M 
 Why I'm talkin' 'bout him 
 Is that me 
 You can't see what I can see 
 Man whatever 
 I gotta get my head together 
 If buttholes were peep shows and the nigs 
 And the window of the soul 
 Of this fucking ridiculous world 
 Analities got nothing on the worlds 
 Except a signed royality check 
 Forged signature 
 The toilet swipe 
 The maggot acid smile 
 The glitch in the universal way, yeah 
 A real boss abortion to brag about at your next BBQ
