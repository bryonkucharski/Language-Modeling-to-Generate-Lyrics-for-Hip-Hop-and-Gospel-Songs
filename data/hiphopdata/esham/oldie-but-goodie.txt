"Brand new Esham from the Eastside of the galaxy" 
 (Esham) 
 I met this little girlie 
 Her pussy hairs was curly 
 The way that bitch sucked off my dick 
 I busted my nut early 
 She asked me for some mo' dick 
 And started sucking mo' dick 
 I said relax you freaky bitch and sit yo' ass up on it 
 Her momma's in the kitchen 
 Her daddy's watching the game 
 I got this bitch all knocking shit off of the shelves And screaming my name 
 Bitch you take this dick up 
 And pay me for that weed 
 You can't just smoke my shit up, get some dick, and tell me to leave 
 Your little sister's watching 
 I think that bitch is hot 
 I know she just a youngin' but I'm good for what she got 
 She peeping through the keyhole 
 I think she wants some peehole 
 I fucked that bitch in the butt, in the backseat of yo' daddy's Geo 
 I stole yo momma's vicodin 
 She just had surgery 
 But, I was so quick in and out of that purse 
 That bitch never heard of me 
 I would try fucking yo momma 
 But that bitch just so fat 
 I seen that bitch step on a one dollar bill and leave four quarters flat 
 WHAT 
 (Chorus - RudeBoy) 
 How many bitches need to know this name? (Boogieman) 
 Check yo ouija board, this ain't no game (Esham) 
 Eastside hoes and money all night (Boogieman) 
 With this boogieman you'll be all right 
 (Esham) 
 Bitch I want a piece of that cookie 
 And bitch I want it for free 
 Popular bitches get they little pussies popped 
 Like Brent Bocker fucking with me 
 I smack your silly ass up 
 You don't roll that fucking grass up 
 And after I'm done, I want the panties gone 
 Cause bitch I'm tearing that ass up 
 I'm mashing down Gratiot, gay bashing 
 Necks I'm slashing 
 Haul assing 
 Heads I'm smashing and crashing 
 Cause deaths my passion 
 Till I'm ashing 
 Wicked shit never gets spun 
 That's why we get clever, get guns 
 I pull a DJ out of his pj's 
 It was E & J with the Soopa Villains 
 And bitch wake me up with brains 
 And maybe I'll loosen your chains 
 Cause bitch you know you will never change 
 You seen more dick than Hanes 
 (Violent J) 
 *Break* 
 *Break* 
 What are we gonna do with these hoes 
 Smack me a bitch up I suppose 
 Hurry up bitch, and jump out ya clothes 
 You about to have dick coming out ya nose 
 (Esham) 
 I met this girl named J-Lo 
 Jimmy-hat on my dick like a sombrero 
 When I rawed her, she said "Te Quiero" 
 Then I was out like human tornado 
 You might see me in the streets of the Motown 
 Pushing crack to my hoes like Bobby Brown 
 Oprah please come and slob me down 
 I'll be like Steadman (?), how you like me now? 
 I got big dick for you hoes to lick 
 I don't trick bitch but take ya bank and split 
 Beyoncè, that's why I'm fucking Kelly 
 In the backseat of a Chevy, after Nelly 
 Michelle pussy just too smelly 
 So we threw her outta the telly 
 Oh really? 
 Don't be acting silly 
 Hoes buttnaked, y'all know the drilly 
 (Chorus - RudeBoy) 
 How many bitches need to know this name? (Boogieman) 
 Check yo ouija board, this ain't no game (Esham) 
 Eastside hoes and money all night (Boogieman) 
 With this boogieman you'll be all right
