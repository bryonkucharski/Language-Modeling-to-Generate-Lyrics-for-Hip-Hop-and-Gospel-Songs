You don't know my fucking [stilo?] 
 I can't fuck with you punk if you can't cop a kilo 
 36 ozs, no [goldees?], hoes on their knees, bitch please 
 I owe the mob 4 million 
 They want their money or their dope or they're killing all my children 
 Fuck that I'm Bruce Wayne insane, if you see me in the rain I'm selling cocaine 
 You see I just joined the mob man 
 And see the run with the righteous or Batman and Robin 
 And I ain't with the stick up 
 For every nigga that you stick up 
 He's bound to call his clique up 
 I got to worry 'bout the police 
 And the F.B.I., wanna know why 
 'Cause I'm a million dolla ball playa 
 And these minor league niggas would love to see me fall playa 
 I'm on craps like 2 dice 
 Fuck FM 98 and that bitch nothin' nice 
 I'm underground like P-Funk, 
 And I'll still put you're bloody body in the fucking trunk punk 
 I'm on 7 mile riding dirty 
 With a birdie in the trunk and a bag of funk 
 Nigga what? 
 I'm on 7 mile ridin' dirty 
 168 I hate to jump back 
 So now I must add and subtract to pay the stack 
 Ill automobiles, V12's and meals 
 A half a million dollar house out in he hills 
 My chrome plated .357's my tool 
 Nigga don't make me out a fuckin' fool 
 You's a hoe ass nigga, ain't got no loot 
 If basketball was a gun, you'd be scared to shoot 
 Fuck that rap that you saying, don't make no sense 
 My recital is vital once I commence 
 Got 36 oz, one kilo z 
 2 8th's is a half and 4 is a key 
 I'm a street politician so I politic 
 If the chicken ain't cookin' then the grease ain't clickin' 
 Get a bird mother fucker, fuck that a nine to five 
 Call me John Travlota 'cause I'm stayin' alive 
 7 mile ridin' dirty 
 To all my homies sellin' dope, don't be a snitch and don't go broke
