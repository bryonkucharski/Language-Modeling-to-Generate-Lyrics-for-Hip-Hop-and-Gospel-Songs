10... 9... 8 
 Ignition sequence start, engines on 
 5... 4... 3... 2... 1 
 All engines running, launch commence 
 I'm high up in the air, I'm feeling the turbulence 
 But when it comes to work, I'm magnificent serving it 
 (Esham) 
 Street lords to my niggas, cheddar boy, clockin' figures 
 Only fuck with the work, just to make my pockets bigger 
 Keep my finger on the trigger, of a AK, 
 Deliver 
 One shot to yo dome, I'll make your whole soul quiver 
 Shiver like the cold winter, like Detroit in December 
 Yo bitch kept beggin me, to put the dick up in her 
 She was riding on it hard, and feeling the turbulence 
 I hit it from the back, but she said I was hurtin' it 
 She told me not to cum, right before I was squirtin it 
 I fuckin' get up, right after I do my dirt in it 
 I make the bed rock, but my name a Rita Mosely 
 Whole ki', 36 Oz.'s, a little whoadie 
 Reel life's my production, no you niggas ain't fuckin' 
 Wit' nothing that I'm doin' 
 I was raised up in the ruins 
 And I'm high up in the air and I'm feeling the turbulence 
 Flying on my magic carpet rockin' a turban, bitch 
 Droppin' bombs on mothafuckers well deserving it 
 Comin' through beatin' down the block disturbin' shit 
 Esham possessed, by the sons of Saddam 
 When I go to sleep, I dream about money, power, and bombs 
 Bitch, you better recognize, the boss of the mob 
 Niggas soaking all my game up, like Spongebob 
 Squarepants 
 I don't dance, I boogie, it's true 
 I cut the head off the devil, and I'll throw it at you 
 May-day, May-Day, throw the coke out on the runway 
 If the D.E.A. come my way, they gettin' gunplay 
 I'm doin' about 100, the wrong way up the runway 
 I wish it was a Monday, but it was a black Sunday 
 I was high up in the air, and feeling the turbulence 
 Jumpin' out of planes, wit' no parachute, on some bird shit 
 Flying through the air, with the greatest of ease 
 Things fall to they knees, snitches tell the police 
 We be high up in the air, and feelin' the turbulence 
 Floating on the black benz, blowing the purple shit 
 Just like the hood, when the ghetto birds circle it 
 Infrared search light, I just might murk you bitch!
