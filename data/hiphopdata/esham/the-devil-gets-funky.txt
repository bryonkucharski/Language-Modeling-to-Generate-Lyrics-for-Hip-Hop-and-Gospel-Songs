When I was born broke I was a joke to many 
 But then I said gimme that respect now your on my jimmy 
 The Unholy, bumpin out your system 
 My kinda music'll make ya go get a exorcism 
 I took a journey in ya mind and then I came out 
 And when I said I'm out your mind I blew your brain out 
 Some think I'm voodoo, but still I'm funky like doo doo 
 Unholy's in the house with the whole kit and kaboodle 
 Microphone mysterious, some say I'm delirious 
 But if you bite my rhyme then you'll die and this is serious 
 The seventh sign of death is the groove so lemme groove ya 
 My flow is just to funky for you its time for me to move ya soul 
 The I rock 'n' roll to the next phase 
 I'll make ya ears bleed blood on the air waves 
 I think the rythym died, I tried to resurrect it 
 But if my shit wasn't def then you'd eject it 
 Disconnect it, uncorrected, as you selected 
 As the devil gets funky 
 More Bounce... Hold it now, that's PLAYED OUT! 
 What the fuck is that funky smell? 
 Now is the Unholy sacrifice 
 You'll pay the price crucified like Christ on the mic 
 Some wonder the evil that men do 
 I don't pretend to, 'cause I'm fin to 
 Get wicket for the sake of my own soul 
 Sold my soul to the highest bidda, now I'm finna 
 Drop juice, or should I say Acid 
 Get loose and try ta diss you'll getcha ass kicked 
 I got a knife and I'll cut cha throat 
 And I'm stabbin any mothafucka who said I wasn't dope 
 Now you see me, now you don't 
 Now you wanna be me, I wonder what fo' 
 Is it 'cause, Esham's far from a fuckin' ho 
 Fuck with me and I'll end up on death row 
 You'll get broken in just like a pair of slacks 
 I break ho's, break hearts, and break backs 
 Killer tracks on wax attack 
 'Cause my mouth is so dirty they wanna wash it with Ajax 
 My nine rhymes go bang it ain't no thang 
 All y'all pussies can't hang as the devil gets funky 
 What the fuck is that funky smell? 
 The devil's just actin' a motherfuckin fool 
 What the fuck is that funky smell? 
 The Devil get's funky... 
 Well as I, get funky in the disco 
 And take your mind for a spin like Sisco 
 On stage I'm still packin my pistol 
 I take all my ho's to the Bristol 
 My Acid Rap ya gonna smoke it like cocaine 
 And if ya don't really like it ain't no thang 
 I made this for my homies ain't shit changed 
 Just the price on the bird and the Night Train 
 Ya say blind milly chilly got glasses 
 I got 20/20 vision just to peep out the asses 
 In the house for the nineteen nine O's 
 And my crew is fuckin' nothin' but fine ho's 
 So when you see us better give up the monkey 
 'Cause I'ma get in that ass and let the devil get funky 
 What the fuck is that funky smell? 
 The Devil get's funky...
