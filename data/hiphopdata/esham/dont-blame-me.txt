Here I come, better run I gotta sawed off shotgun 
 Pump that buck and you might catch a hot one 
 Call me a head hunter, head's I've chopped off 
 Cemetery's full from the bodies I dropped off 
 Mothafuckaz hate me, 'cause I'm singing Blasphemy 
 Die and go to hell and when you get there ask for me 
 Come along for the ride, drive you to suicide 
 I'm the Unholy Esham, that's right 
 Get me a razor blade and I might jack a spade 
 Or jack jack my dick to a poor porno flick 
 Nasty motherfucker with the wicked mentallity 
 Thirteen ways is a small technicallity 
 'Cause I got one, blow your fuckin' head out 
 Pull your fuckin' eyes out, just to get the red out 
 If you be a nigga or a white boy honkey 
 I get funky, hip hop junkie 
 Serial killa, frosted flakes 
 Fucked up in the head waking up with the shakes 
 Those are the breaks, fuckin' up the fakes 
 Some shit I make you can't take 
 But don't blame me. 
 Don't blame me 
 Don't blame me 
 Don't blame me 
 Don't blame me, the devil made me do it. 
 Better reach your children, 'cause I might burn em' 
 Teach em' and learn em' a motherfuckin lesson 
 Get my Smith and Wesson and blow your baby's head off 
 From watchin bullshit, turn the TV set off 
 Psycho, and I might go like Michael 
 Say some shit that you might not like so 
 Who's that god that you praise the lord to 
 Buyin that ticket to the heavens, can't afford to 
 Esham's back with the New Jack Swing 
 I don't pray or none or those things 
 Now we got niggaz that's rappin' bout god y'all 
 Praise the lord to me the black oddball 
 I ain't no joke and my words ain't fiction 
 If you think so you can suck my dick then 
 I don't like preachers, or prayers, but playaz 
 Esham the Unholy wicked rhyme sayer 
 Swing with the Slayer, sing if you dare 
 But just like before I don't care 
 And don't blame me. 
 Don't blame me (we are searchers of the truth) 
 Don't blame me (we are searchers of the truth) 
 Don't blame me (we are searchers of the truth) 
 Don't blame me, the devil made me do it. 
 Sick in the head, knotty like a dread 
 Pump that lead 'cause I'd rather be dead 
 Gimme what you got if you hip you get with me 
 I think my wrist is talking to you tellin' you to slit me 
 Suicidalist and I'm unorthadox 
 Down with the black sox, whiskey on the rocks 
 You might catch me in a jail cell with a wig 
 I slaughtered me a pig, but you can't dig 
 The voices in my head, tellin' me to waste ya 
 Pig that Bacon ham sandwich I can taste ya 
 Everybody lookin' for a bible to touch 
 We shall overcome is a bit too much 
 But you can't touch this 
 Religion is some hokus-pokus 
 Betcha seein god when you focus 
 But when the day comes and you gotta run for shelter 
 Now you screamin Hellterskellter 
 Damn, you gotta turn off the TV 
 Or don't blame me. 
 Don't blame me (don't start no shit now) 
 Don't blame me (don't start no shit now) 
 Don't blame me (don't start no shit now) 
 Don't balme me, the devil made me do it.
