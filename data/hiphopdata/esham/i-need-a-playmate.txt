I want a playmate 
 I said I want a playmate 
 I want a playmate 
 I said I want a playmate 
 My playboy bunny 
 My money don got kinda low 
 The day was sunny, 
 So I just decided she would go, 
 Out to the movies and maybe much later we would kiss 
 Jumped in the water 
 Cause all I received was cold fish 
 Lookin' for some action, and out on my two wheels I would seek 
 I need a freak, and someone who ain't afraid of the E 
 Wanna have some fun? The run by my way, you can cum 
 Come with me, and we'll walk right up into the sun 
 Neva knew no one, in the Y2K who ain't packin' no gun 
 Baby come and get some 
 If you givin' up cause you gets no weed funds 
 You gets no weed funds 
 My playboy bunny, her turn-ons include 
 Pony rides 
 Wanna spank that monkey 
 She's tellin' you to come inside 
 Wanna have some carrot cake 
 I have always wanted a playmate 
 Could it be my fate, to pick you up around 8, 20-inch rim skate 
 It's a dream date 
 I want a playmate 
 I said I want a playmate 
 Let's play 
 I want a playmate 
 I said I want a playmate 
 My playboy bunny 
 To the president there's a lesson we all learn 
 In time everyone will get a intern 
 I saw your picture, you posin' just like a magazine 
 No one would ever know that you was a sexual fiend 
 Wanna be my queen? 
 We could walk to the park and eat jellybeans 
 You the girl of my dreams 
 Make all the other women look like dope fiends 
 Movie screens, porno stars goin' far in cars 
 Centerfolds, dirty dancing up in titty bars 
 I want a playmate 
 I want a playmate 
 I said I want a playmate 
 I want a playmate 
 I said I want a playmate 
 I want a playmate
