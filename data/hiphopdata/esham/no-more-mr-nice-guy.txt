(Esham talking) 
 Bitch ass niggaz don't wanna respect 
 Got 'em in check 
 No more Mr. nice guy, yo no more Mr. nice guy 
 (Esham) 
 My aggravation for this murder made me write this while I was dreaming 
 She's suffocating 'cause I hurt her she was frightened she was screamin 
 I was dreaming when I wrote this so don't quote me or you'll see me 
 I'm that nigga in your nightmare put a hole up in your beanie 
 I'm Esham, the devil, and God can't save me 
 You better believe in this blasphemy 
 These might be the last words you here from me 
 Oh no, I've fallen 
 The demons are callin 
 I see 'em in my daydreams, man these niggaz don't understand 
 I'm being followed by black crows and when it rains I wanna kill 
 Esham's no Frosted Flake, Unholy is cereal 
 What's the deal? I'm trapped in hell 
 And Satan told me sold my soul 
 No forgiveness for the sacrilegious nigga outta control 
 I bust a cap in the middle of the night 
 And hit your pitbull by mistake 
 Hoe ass nigga started cryin 'cause I started barkin at the wake 
 I be the U-N-H-O-L-Y, and I sing that murder lullabye 
 And I tellin' you bitches right now 
 No more Mr. nice guy 
 No Mr. nice guy I was saying cause you bitches think I'm playin' 
 I be smokin' so much bud my brains inside my head decayin 
 I was young and terrible, ain't no other comparable 
 The ghost writin, rhyme recitin you unaware hoe 
 I taught ya, and torture, I'm a menace in my sentence 
 I'll never be on my knees, beggin for repentance 
 You niggaz just hate me cause you can't see my power 
 I be smokin' dead flowerz in the midnight hour 
 I'm Esham, the devil, black devil, the demon 
 Lucifer released the wicket sperm and I'm the semen 
 Don't play me like a sucker 'cause I'll kill you muthafucka 
 Chickenhead killa 
 Clockin the dolla billas 
 In Detroit every nigga and every bitch is turned out 
 Every block you bend a corner on shit is burned out 
 Nobody likes nobody so we all pack guns 
 I got a knot in my pocket, all in ones 
 Man, no more Mr. nice guy 
 (Whispering) 
 No more Mr. nice guy 
 I'm wicket in this industry
