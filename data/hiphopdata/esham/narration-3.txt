Esham's dope hoe, dig the flow, 
 No showin' where the story'll go 
 Muthafuckas scared of him like he Anthrax Man, 
 'Cause they all caught up in the show 
 Mad years deep in the underground, 
 Spittin' hideous, wickedest rhymes 
 FBI be always by, 
 He be stretchin' them constitutional lines 
 Everybody always thinkin' he be voodoo head shrinkin' out with Lucifer 
 And them was gettin' old 
 So he closed the casket on the Devil shit 
 And let new inner rages explode 
 Acid Rain, and truth in explain and that he only tried to entertain 
 And it ain't his fuckin' fault you lit your head on fire and you went insane over the shit
