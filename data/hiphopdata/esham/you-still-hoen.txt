Now this goes out to all the big butt sluts 
 Makin' mo' niggaz nut and gettin' played like mutts 
 Now say ho, I spent my last on a ho to let you know 
 It don't pay to be a ho, 'cause I tally up ho's 
 Like dominos stack em, knock 'em down and smack em 
 Rack 'em up and shack em, baby boy I mack em 
 But hey, it ain't no thang to me to play yo ass like P 
 I mean bitch a get dissed ho fuckin' with this 
 It ain't no ho's out there I respect 
 See bitch you betta run a mic check 1-2-eh yo ho 
 Your big booty in them coochie cut daisey's 
 You askin for some money but your juices got me crazy 
 And ho, I might give up the dough, 'cause ain't no thang to a true 
 Twenty dollars ain't shit ho I thought you knew 
 Just to fuck it, I'll give up the ducket's 
 I got your legs cocked in the back seat of my bucket 
 Will you suck it for another 20/20 ho I'm feindin 
 Ridin' down the mile in my drop top leanin 
 Stank ho, stank ho, I gotta know stank ho... 
 Is you still ho'in. 
 Is you still ho'in, bitch you still fuckin'? 
 It's written on your lips no payin' no suckin 
 Project ho, neighborhood star 
 You wont get far I don't care who's ho you are 
 Check mic, check mic, one, two, one, two 
 Ya momma had you... and she a ho too 
 But hey, it's all in the games you play 
 'Cause ho's like you was raised to be that way 
 Say ho, you still doin' that thang with ya body 
 Suckin on dicks drinkin' cum like Bacardi 
 Ain't nothin' but a party goin' on with ya pussy 
 If pussies could talk, It'd say "ho please douche me" 
 And ho, you know like I know you know 
 You was a ho from Tokyo a long time ago 
 Ain't nothin' but the freak of the week 
 I thought she was p-funk gettin' knee deep 
 From the front to the back of a Fleetwood Cadillac 
 Suckin on her titties try'in to get a little similac 
 Uh, can I get a witness, when I ask this 
 Is you still ho'in
