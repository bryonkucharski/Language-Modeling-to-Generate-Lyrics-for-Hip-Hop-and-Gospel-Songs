I caught me a slug froma 45 
 Now I gotta take a dive 
 I'm suicidal 
 I'm trying not to stay alive 
 Voices in my head keep telling me they wanna kill me 
 And bullets from this gun keep tellin' me they wanna feel me 
 I'm sicker then I should be 
 So I kick it kinda critical 
 Psycho like a mad man 
 In a hospital 
 But you wanna put 'em in me 
 Put 'em in me 
 Do it quick 
 Then put me in the ground with my balls and my dick 
 I caught a slug froma 45 
 I caught a slug froma 45 
 Slug from a 45 
 Was my cause of death 
 I tried to squeeze the trigger 
 But there was no more bullets left 
 A hole in my head 
 A fucking hole in my head 
 Bury me alive 
 But I'm better off dead 
 Damn, I feel like I wanna die 
 And murder's my alibi 
 I know that I gonna die 
 When bullets fly 
 Should I put the barrel in my mouth 
 And close my eyes? 
 A man never cries when he dies 
 And I, 
 I caught a slug froma 45 
 I caught a slug froma 45 
 I caught a slug froma 45 
 I caught a slug 
 And got drug 
 My grave got dug 
 I heard chug-a-lug 
 When my head squirted blood 
 My body beaten bad 
 Brother but my body bled 
 And when I squirt off lead 
 I'm putting out my own head 
 I wonder why I did it 
 Did it, why I do, I done it 
 I play the game of death 
 And I guess I finally won it 
 I never fronted 
 But I'm fronting 
 For the fact I fell 
 Dead men don't say goodbye 
 Guess I'll see your ass in Hell 
 I caught a slug froma 45 
 I caught a slug froma 45 
 I caught a slug froma 45
