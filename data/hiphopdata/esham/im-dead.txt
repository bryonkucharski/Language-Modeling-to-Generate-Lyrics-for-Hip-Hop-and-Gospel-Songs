Who stole my soul? You tryin' to kill me, how you gonna kill a dead man? 
 I'm already dead you can't kill me you God damn bastard! 
 I'm ddeaaaaaaaad 
 I know you tryin' ta kill me 
 I'm dead, I'm dead I'm dead, I'm deeeeeaaaaaaaaad 
 I'm comin' in but I need some therapy 
 I gotta stay medicated just to keep some clarity 
 My cranium cracked open and started smokin' 
 Fire comes outta my mouth when words are spoken 
 I spit this sickness, slit ya wrist with the quickness 
 The wicked one with the wicked tongue 
 I close my eyes and see visions of niggaz bustin' guns 
 Snatch ya tongue outcha mouth and you'll hafta hum 
 Come get some, be another victim 
 And I dog fight all night when I hear sick em 
 Because I'm dead (I know you tryin' to kill me) 
 Slugs to the head, blood stains on his shirt turn red 
 Never thought I'd get twisted like a dred, deceased so rest in peace I said 
 I'm dead from a bullet from a gun 
 Emptied out two clips not one 
 Narcles raid, you best run or you'll be locked down can't see no sun 
 When ya dead, you don't give a fuck bout what's goin' on 
 What's on the radio, what a number one song? 
 Bitch don't blow my bust 
 'Cause if you do, I just might hafta put a few in you 
 Cause you don't have a clue, you know who the fuck you talkin' to? 
 Lil' hoe, ay yo watch me go Quasimodo 
 So live niggaz copy the dead like a photo 
 Never rap about fans named Stan like a hoe doe 
 Kill me, Kill me, kill me, kill me
