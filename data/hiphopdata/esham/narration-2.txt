Bitches tryna mace me and shit 
 Bitch I carry mace 
 I'll mace you bitch 
 Well 
 Reel Life Productions, hydrolics chucks' and big bucks, dick sucks, and fucks 
 So deep underground with pumps and drills couldn't reach 'em for a couple of months 
 We let him take all the heat, it's not like he goin' to hell anyway 
 We just danced on a path they laid, nobody knowin' what they goin' through like no way 
 These rappers bit that wicked shit because Esham went too far 
 They just his flavor, made a lil bit safer, then run off and become stars 
 We live and learn in this life we live and fools learned how to bite his rhyme 
 Esham didn't mind, he'll get his in time, he just continued on under the sunshine baby
