You are now about to enter my mind, a place where few have dared to go, when... it's about to blow. 
 Life ain't shit, yours and mine 
 In god it's time, I gotta find myself 
 Through all this madness 
 Manic depression and sadness 
 I want a way out, I want a better route 
 Voices in my head, I wanna let 'em out 
 I get so pissed off, when shit ain't going right 
 It gets tight 
 I'm trapped in here 
 The only friend I got is my enemy and he's in the mirror 
 I gotta deal with the tension 
 The shit get's so deep, I don't go to sleep 
 Bullshit and hell on earth 
 I ask myself, how much is my life worth? 
 I'm thinkin' bout god 
 In god we trust, but I can't trust him 
 Before I die, the one thing I wanna do 
 Is have my cake and eat it too 
 I was born in sin, I guess I'm born again 
 From this life I was torn to get born again 
 It's all fucked up... I think my minds blowin' up 
 If you can just, get yo mind together 
 If you can just, get yo mind together 
 I said I gotta get my head together 
 But my head ain't together yet 
 I'm thinkin' no sweat 
 Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge 
 I'd rather jump off the ledge myself 
 Symptoms of insanity, might as well do it 
 Ain't nothin' to it but to do it 
 I'm comin' down off a bad trip 
 LSD, I got's the acid 
 Life ain't nothin' but a riddle 
 Deaths on the other side 
 I'm kinda stuck in the middle 
 Can I get a little or alot 
 Can I say a prayer, your religion's all you got 
 I know what I'm supposed to know 
 But I don't know when I gotta go I gotta go 
 Somebodys callin me 
 You see what I'm sayin' 'cause I'm sayin' what you see 
 I can't walk alone, I'm in the Twilight Zone 
 They told me Jesus was a clone 
 I don't read the bible 
 Because it's all about survival 
 So I get my rifle and get trifled 
 It's all fucked up... I think my minds blowin' up 
 If you can just, get yo mind together 
 If you can just, get yo mind together 
 I take time out to smell the shit 
 All the shit, all this shit I can't deal with 
 And if I deal with it, then I get ill with it 
 I'm kinda still with it, but I stay reel with it 
 I can't get caught up, trouble's my mind thought up 
 Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde's back brought up 
 Some people tell me that I'm way outta line 
 I step back and touch their heads and blow their minds 
 I feel I'm ill, I feel I'm reel 
 I feel I'm dead, I feel I died, but I'm alive still 
 The only problem I have is life, living 
 But I don't sweat it, I don't regret it 
 Give what I'm giving, test me and you'll fail 
 Follow in my footsteps and walk the bloody trail 
 How much is my life worth on a scale 
 From one to ten, can't win for lose and lose to win 
 I can't begin to tell you how it's fucked up 
 I think my minds blowin' up 
 If you can just, get yo mind together 
 If you can just, get yo mind together
