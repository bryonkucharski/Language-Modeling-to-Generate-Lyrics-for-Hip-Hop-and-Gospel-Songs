I know that I'm crazy 
 (It's nobody's fault but mine) 
 I know that I'm lazy 
 (It's nobody's fault but mine) 
 I know you don't love me 
 (It's nobody's fault but mine) 
 I know that you hate me 
 (It's nobody's fault but mine) 
 Once again, it's on, 3-5-7 chrome 
 Damn what's goin' on in my maggot dome 
 A pill poppin', hip hoppin' nigga with a death wish 
 Suicidalist but I'm still so selfish 
 Used to have this hoe, that anotha while ago 
 But the bitch played out like disco, cisco 
 Drinkin' dead bodies, stinkin' nervous twitch 
 Eye blink 
 I stabbed her 26 times with my dagger Jiggy Skwagger style 
 I gave a smile 
 Rigamortis body froze 
 Them slit her throat then watch her shake till her eyes close 
 A bloody body on my bathroom flo' 
 When the cops came to get me I said so, hey yo 
 I know that I'm crazy 
 (It's nobody's fault but mine) 
 I know that I'm lazy 
 (It's nobody's fault but mine) 
 I know you don't love me 
 (It's nobody's fault but mine) 
 I know that you hate me 
 (It's nobody's fault but mine) 
 1, 2, 3 pigs knockin' at my do' 
 Tryna catch the big bad wolf, I blew they house down, BOOM 
 Bacon all over the room 
 Say hello to my little friend 
 I bust a shot again 
 3 cops dead, now I'm called the cop killa 
 Illa cap peela 
 Bullet body full of bloody naps 
 Bust caps in Superman kneecaps 
 I can't believe she didn't love me so she didn't breath 
 I took her to the place where the sun don't shine 
 Without you, there's no me, so I'm goin' out my fuckin' mind 
 Runnin' blind with the bloody steel piece 
 I didn't know I was surrounded by police 
 And all I said was 
 I know that I'm crazy
