12 in da morning woke up with tha shakes, Cereal killa mista Frosted Flakes, My 
 Hands were all bloody and I don't know why, I'm thinkin' bout my bitch and why 
 She had to die, Some niggas outa get me she was settin me up, They pulled out 
 They pistols started wettin me up, I see my life pass before my eyes in a 
 Flash, I drew out my weapon and I started to blast, My bitch caught a slug in tha 
 Back of tha neck, I emptied out tha clip them niggas hit tha deck, I ran for tha 
 Beamer is was sittin' in front, I left my bitch body smokin' like a Philly 
 Blunt//and it was In da Midnight hour, In da Midnight hour it all happened, In da 
 Midnight hour, In da Midnight hour they start cappin//I'm bleedin like a mutha 
 Fucka grabbin my chest, my heartbeat racin like a EMS, I called my parter up on 
 Tha portible phone, I blew my bitch brains out wit tha chrome, My nigga said he'd 
 Meet me at tha Omni hotel court date was today and he just jumped bail, Police 
 Outa get'em he was under arrest, Bench warrant for my nigga wit tha mental 
 Stress, Met my nigga at tha spot and he had nothin' to say, Metro airport to East 
 LA, When we got to tha city it was drama again seen a nigga who we jacked in 89 
 For 10//and it was in da Midnight hour, In da Midnight hour it all happened, In 
 Da Midnight hour, In da Midnight hour they start cappin//Tha nigga started 
 Trippin' he was wavin his gun, Pissed off since 89 'cause we murdered his son, Srtay 
 Bullets started flyin every way but in mine, Still bleedin like pig and I'm 
 Pressed for time, I looked up and my nigga caught a slug in his face, Now I'm mad 
 Then a mutha fucka tryin' to embrace, My homie body turned cold, I felt him 
 Slippin away, He was just here alive now he's dead today, And tha nigga who had 
 Shot'em he was shot on tha floor, So I went to his body and I shot him some 
 More, He looked me dead in tha face and said you goin' to hell, I spit blood in 
 His face as I started to tell//In da Midnight hour, In da Midnight hour it all 
 Happened, In da Midnight hour, In da Midnight hour they start cappin 
 "Midnight hour"
