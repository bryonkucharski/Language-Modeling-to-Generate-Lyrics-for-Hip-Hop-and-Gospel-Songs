Let's take a trip, back into time, as I explain, 
 Things ain't the same, I'm goin' back down memory lane. 
 And as I travel, dirt roads of gravel, 
 Two sets of foot prints for me and my shadow. 
 The unholy speaks as I walk in my sleep, 
 And my speech makes you weak, means my words are too deep. 
 You see soceity's strung on a Bible and a man, 
 With the will of the devil to destroy and he can. 
 You see, time after time, have I made up my mind, 
 Should I be a vegeterian, or die, eat swine. 
 Can I lose my religon, every day, it's a habit, 
 Is religon just for kids or am I a silly rabbit? 
 Am I lost in a book that says sins are forbidden, 
 Who am I to believe when the Bible was really written? 
 I don't know, will I die? 
 I can't live in a lie, 
 Cross my heart and hope to die, 
 I'm losin my religon. 
 Am I wrong or insane, using God's name in vain, 
 When the preacher sells cocaine, how am I to be sane. 
 See first he's a preacher, now he's slangin' ki's, 
 College educated from workin' at Mickey D's. 
 I got no say in the world today, 
 Livin' in AmeriKKK. 
 You call me the devil 'cause I refuse to pray, 
 But your religious games I refuse to play. 
 Bible study's not my buddy, 
 Shake the preacher, now my hand's all bloody. 
 Daily gossip, religious philosophies, 
 Nigga please, I'm losin my religon.
