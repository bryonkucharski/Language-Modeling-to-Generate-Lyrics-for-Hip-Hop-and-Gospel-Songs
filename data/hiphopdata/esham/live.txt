Let me hear you say "Kid Rocks up on the stage" 
 Hey slick, check it 
 I'm the Rock you know, I'm gonna smoke it up 
 So I can rock it through old school disco cuts 
 I'm the crisco slick, checkin' sisco's shit 
 I'm the ultimate 
 Yes the K, to the I to the D-D-D, are-O-see-see-K all motherfuckin day 
 While I'm strong, let me steal your rhyme 
 Got the matches, tank, and the 4 foot bong 
 Uh, and I ain't bullshittin 
 Suckin motherfuckers with the game I'm spittin' 
 And ain't a damn thing changed 
 Come on y'all and tell me, what's my name? 
 (Kid Rock, Rock) 
 I'm the boy fucked up with the hip and hop 
 And on the seven sea's they call me Daddy Rock 
 I had to coochie watch, back in the day 
 But I pawned that shit for a rock, last May 
 And now I'm back on track 
 I don't smoke the crack, don't shoot the smack 
 I told y'all once, I don't bang 
 But I lick more coochie than Katie Lang 
 Uh, and you don't stop 
 Rock the rhythm that'll make your body pop 
 That somebody, anybody, all y'all scream 
 (Kid Rock, Rock) 
 Check it out yo 
 What I want to do is break it down 
 And show y'all a little somthin about where I come from 
 Show you some skills of how I used to rock basement party's 
 On the wheels of steel, back in the day in the klem yo 
 Check it 
 (Kid Rock, Rock) 
 Some of that yo 
 It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin party yo 
 Break it down on the lst like this 
 It ain't no party like a Detroit party 
 'Cause a Detroit party don't stop 
 It ain't no party like a Detroit party 
 When you're in the fuckin' house with Kid Rock
