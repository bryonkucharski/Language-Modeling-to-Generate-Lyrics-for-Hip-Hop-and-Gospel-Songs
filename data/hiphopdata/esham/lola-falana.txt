In these times of hurt and pain 
 We need a remedy to take us from the rain 
 A little hunger, a little greed 
 I been thinking 'bout what I need 
 I need a freak to hold me tight 
 I need a freak everyday and every night 
 I need a freak, someone like you 
 I need a freak cause freaks are people too 
 I need a freak to suck my dick 
 I need a freak baby, muthafuck a trick 
 I need a freak, my own private hoe 
 I need a freak to work that pussy fast and slow 
 I need a freak, my baby doll 
 I need a freak when I'm ridin' 7 Mile 
 I need a freak, someone like you 
 I need a freak cause freaks are people too 
 I need a freak to get me served 
 I need a freak to calm my nerves 
 I need a freak to roll my weed 
 I need a freak, that's what I need 
 I need a freak 
 I need a freak 
 I need a freak 
 I need a freak
