I'm not taking enough medicine, 
 I know I'm sick in the mother fucking head 
 These niggers think I'm nice, 
 You don't know me very well do you? 
 Check this shit out 
 As I take a dose of this medicine 
 Now watch me sin 
 Take a sniff of this boy, I'm the real McCoy 
 Real nutty, just like Almond Joy 
 Screamin' I want that nigger dead and when you dead I'ma enjoy 
 Haunting and taunting the microphone 
 Reconstruct your brain and fuck up your chromosomes 
 On my own since a toddler 
 45 bullets swallower 
 Footprints burn in the sand 
 Cause all my shit be kickin' 
 Just like Japan, chop off your hands 
 Ya fall off you're done 
 Who's number one with the bloody bullets 
 From the gun, that shot the rapper down 
 No more will he see the sun 
 The U-N-H-O-L-Y, while the revolution, has begun 
 And it will not be televised, bitch ass nigga 
 666, bloody mic in my hand 
 Rolex ain't worth no fucking 30 grand 
 Half y'all niggas can't stand on your own two feet 
 You ain't nothin' but a worm who needs to be 6 feet deep 
 Water 
 When I'm in Cleveland I be in the projects I be smokin' wet 
 Seein' all types of shit things that my mind won't never forget 
 And I am, sacrilegious 
 And still block indigious 
 My voodoo's just as true as Andy Palmer 
 But I warned ya 
 The day will come when niggas will fill this prophecy 
 And if they ever do you might go crazy from what you see 
 Make you wanna be blind 
 Some say I see too much 
 But I see straight through your mind 
 You brain's so close I can touch it 
 And the revolution, will not be televised for your punk ass 
 You don't even know, you're stupid 
 I shot a hole in my television set 
 On the presidents announcement 
 Cause little do he know, 
 Aliens is plottin' on the government 
 But the suicidal sick, 
 Mother fucker still livin' 
 Murder ride driven 
 The dead has arisen 
 The neighborhood's the prisons, 
 Is anybody listenin'? 
 Or is niggas just blowin' bubbles sittin' around whistlin'? 
 Hello, bitch, is anybody in there? 
 And women don't know they can change this shit 
 But they so busy tryin' to shake their tits 
 Money, in god we trust, lust and bustful 
 But still don't trust no force 
 Beware of the pale white force 
 Knock your punk ass off course 
 Of course, the revolution will not be televised 
 For no punk ass nigga 
 Yo, yo I said, 
 The revolution will not be televised, will not be televised, 
 It will not be televised
