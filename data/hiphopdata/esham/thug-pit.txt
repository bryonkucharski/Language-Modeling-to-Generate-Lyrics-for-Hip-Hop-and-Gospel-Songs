 Wicked Wonka, baby

 Halloween! Hallowicked Wonka... just 18 months 
 (Violent J) 
 I brought a bat to a mosh-pit 
 (Layzie - Well what you do then??) 
 I split some craniums in half 
 And caved a few in 
 Before long I'm standing there alone 
 I shut the party down 
 For Bone Thugs, Tech N9ne, Kottonmouth and Esham 
 (Layzie Bone) 
 In... coming, I'm running and dropping them bombs 
 Still gunning, I'm willing and ready for war 
 Get down with the clowns from ICP, be-O-N-E 
 And the Kottonmouth Kings, bring it how we bring it doe 
 For the wicked wonka, Halloween 
 (Violent J)

 Hater slappers, wicked shit believe it though

 Strictly for the purpose of splitting some craniums

 Treating fake thugs like a hoe, tell 'em D-Loc

 Then run down the line, damn right I'm getting mine 
 With a fine ass bitch, getting head, sipping wine 
 (Shaggy 2 Dope)

 A nigga wanna slam strange

 We sparking fifties and fifties 
 Crashing after parties

 Ducking and dodging the coppers 
 Ain't no one out that can stop us 
 Dropping that shit that be popping 
 Making it hotter and hotter

 Busting bright red bandanas

 Spending all my change on that endo smoke 
 All the bitches on the road, scheming for my loot 
 They get nothing but dick, and a steel toed boot 
 (Esham) 
 Fuck Proof, every Halloween, I dress like a bag lady 
 Then I ride around with my .380 looking for Shady 
 If I catch him at the shelter, I'ma pull his file 
 Chop his head off, and bury his body across 8 mile 
 (Daddy-X) 
 We drinking drank, drank

 Mobbing through these streets like a fleet of armored tanks 
 We dropping bombs, underground bombs
