 Please relax and prepare for takeoff 
 Bodies all on the ground 
 Bodies crawling all around 
 Bodies falling all down 
 Who did this? 
 Bodies all on the ground 
 Bodies crawling all around 
 Bodies falling all down 
 Who did this? 
 Bodies all on the ground 
 Bodies crawling all around 
 Bodies falling all down 
 Who did this? 
 How many bodies must fall to the ground 
 Drop dead 
 Eyeballs popping out their heads 
 Bloody bodies 
 Murder be my favorite hobby 
 And if you don't believe me 
 Mothafucker come and try me 
 I be planning a caper 
 Kill you, take all of your paper 
 Even if you fall asleep 
 In your dreams I creep 
 With Jason and Freddy Krueger, ready to do ya 
 If I don't hit ya with the axe and slice right through ya 
 I'm going on a killing spree after every MC 
 So when I kill your favorite rappers only left is me 
 Bodies all on the ground 
 Bodies crawling all around 
 Bodies falling all down 
 Who did this? 
 Bodies all on the ground 
 Bodies crawling all around 
 Bodies falling all down 
 Who did this? 
 I'm going on a killing spree 
 Yo... one... one... 
 One MC thought his style was the truth 
 Before he spit I shot his ass in the head 
 In the vocal booth 
 Now you got no proof 
 'Cause I burnt all the evidence 
 And the game ain't been the same ever since 
 I killed the fresh MC, he died yesterday, 
 I shot him in the head 
 With the A.K. 
 And don't nobody care 'cause I ain't got no love for them 
 Bodies drug for them 
 Graves get dug for them 
 On the microphone slugs... I throw them... uh... 
 Bodies fall... 
 Act like you don't know 
 *Break* 
 I been... I, I, I been... I, I, I been... I, I, I been... I been... 
 I been smoking, I been drinking, 
 To myself I start to thinking 
 In my mind it slowly sinks in, 
 Dead bodies starting to stinking 
 I been smoking, I been drinking, 
 To myself I start to thinking 
 In my mind it slowly sinks in, 
 Dead bodies starting to stinking 
 Bodies stinking evil forces 
 I can smell their rotting corpses 
 Maggots crawl around in the grounds 
 As they take you down 
 Evil dogs, bark at night 
 I can even smell your fright 
 Smells like bacon 
 Bacon and ham 
 I know you know who I am 
 Who am I? 
 I am E-S-H-A-M you know me 
 And I will tell you this 
 Bodies stink like fish 
 I'm a suicidalist 
 Still I clutch the gun in my fist 
 Taking them risks 
 Penitentiary chances, and 
 Let me tell you there's no answer 
 For all your pain 
 In the rain
