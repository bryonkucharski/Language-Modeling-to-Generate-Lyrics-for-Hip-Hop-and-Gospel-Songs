Meanwhile, back on the east side 
 All I know, Get doe (keep gettin' that doe) 
 Flip another O, Get doe (keep gettin' that doe) 
 Get it fast or slow, Get doe (keep gettin' that doe) 
 Better tell ya hoe, get doe (keep gettin' that doe) 
 All I know, Get doe (keep gettin' that doe) 
 Flip another O, Get doe (keep gettin' that doe) 
 Get it fast or slow, Get doe (keep gettin' that doe) 
 Better tell ya hoe, get doe (keep gettin' that doe) 
 All I know is chefin' up dope 
 Break it down and get it ready for the fiends to smoke 
 It's the true to be paid, nightmares your broke 
 You'd rather have Freddy and Jason come slit your throat 
 In this life we live in, cash rules everything 
 I'm married too my riches, fuck bitches and wedding rings 
 Push the peddle to the metal while your still peddling 
 Forever in the fast lane, never settling 
 Get dough, sniff blow, get some more, get a O of some dro 
 Blow some doe with my hoe 
 You might see me at the MO MO with a thick chako 
 I'm a giant robot, you Johnny Saco 
 Stacking up my chips like Esay at King Taco 
 Hot like tobasco like me, but you're not though 
 Hoes they love to lick on my balls 
 Drop to they knees and crawl like a dog 
 All I know is getting that doe 
 Getting that dough, getting that doe 
 Hoes they love to lick on my balls 
 Drop to they knees and crawl like a dog 
 All I know is getting that doe 
 Getting that dough, getting that doe 
 I need my skrilla my frietos 
 My fetty fetty fetty 
 My cheddy cheddy cheddy 
 But y'all ain't even ready 
 Like Speedy Gonzey lets chase the cheese fast 
 Cash over ass, never in a rat trap, tote the gat for that 
 Pockets stay lumpy, keep the pump with me 
 Ain't no punkin' me, murder in company 
 Whip out the chrome for the block of provalone 
 Or the limburger, screaming murda murda murda 
 You, your crew, her, him, and them, all get clapped by E-S-H-A-M 
 You might not be hungry like me 
 All I know when out in these streets: 
 G-E-T D-O-E 
 Pay attention muthafucker, you don't know me 
 You might not be hungry like me 
 All I know when out in these streets: 
 G-E-T D-O-E 
 Pay attention muthafucker, you don't know me
