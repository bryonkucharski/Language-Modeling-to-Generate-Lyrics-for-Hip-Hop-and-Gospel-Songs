Duncan Hines 
 Funky rhymes I like goin' in from behind 
 Take my finger and dip it in 
 Hittin' them skins, much skins 
 I like chocolate with extra cream 
 Hittin' them cakes a daily routine 
 Stir it with my finger, just like a stick 
 The devil's out the soup, 
 Now he's in the cake mix 
 This time, I gotta mix it up 
 The sugar's in one cup, 
 The cream in another cup 
 Upside down, cake rattle 'n' roll 
 The cake mix runs down side of the bowl 
 I dip my face in the bowl, just to get a sniff 
 Kinda smells fishy once I get a wiff 
 Take my spoon and stir it up, kinda good 
 Now I got a woody-wood pecker could I whisper in your ear, 
 And tell you what I need 
 How many cakes to fill one man's greed? 
 One ho cake, two ho cakes, damn, 
 Damn, I think I'm stirrin' kinda slow 
 5 ho cakes, 6 ho cakes 
 I got my finger in your cake mix 
 What's the matter with my cake batter? 
 I need a jimmy hat like the mad hatter 
 Too much cream, baby, def' too much 
 I guess you like your cake mixed with nuts 
 Spread that cake mix nice and thick 
 Lick the spoon like you lick my dick 
 I don't think it's ready for the oven yet 
 We'll both know when we start to sweat 
 Betty Crocker, drink some vodka 
 Then I stuck her with my cocka 
 You got cake mix on your drawers 
 I got cake mix on my balls 
 This cake mix is nice and sweet 
 But this cake mix you do not eat 
 This cake mix is soft and wet 
 And just to get my dick erect 
 You might say that I'm kinda sick 
 But that's what's happenin' when I'm rappin' 'bout your little girl's cake mix 
 I got caught with my finger in the cake mix 
 I don't like trick or treatin' 
 I'd rather have a trick 
 And if you got me some dessert 
 Just open up your shirt 
 I'll stick my spoon in the mix 
 And then I'll go to work 
 Your oven is hot, it's ready to bake 
 The devil's in your soup as you masturbate 
 As you jerk my dick or mix with my spoon 
 It's gonna add flavor to the cake mix soon 
 The cake is mellow and moist and wet 
 I never had a cake that made me sweat 
 It's like a Dunkan Hines a Hostess twinkie pie 
 Put my face too close to the cake and got cream in my eye 
 There's nothin' I can't mix 
 There's nothin' 'I can't fix 
 But while I'm bakin' cakes 
 I got my finger in the cake mix
