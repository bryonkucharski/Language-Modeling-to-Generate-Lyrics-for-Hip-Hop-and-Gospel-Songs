(DJ talking) 
 Now rockin' with the best, so I'd advise all you brothas to get on down, I said get on down, get yo ass on down. 
 I don't give a god damn about radio play 
 'Cause I do what I wanna do anyway 
 I can slit my wrists if I wanna 
 By the time I get to Arizona 
 I'm not from L.A. or New York 
 I chill in Detroit, on the sidewalk 
 City slicka, drink a little liquor 
 Wanna see a trick? Suck my dick 
 B-Boy, down for my town 
 Some just love the way it sound 
 Call me the B-D 
 The Unholy Esham's crankin out your CD 
 Man that's sweet 
 Beat's get broke but I still rock break beats 
 Call me some kinda fool 
 When I was ten I got kicked outta Sunday school 
 The reverend don't like me 
 He said 3 times, 3 times, 3 times, 2 is me 
 666 man, they callin me a sick man 
 But I just kick jams 
 Make ya say amen, I gotta G-E-T... D-O-W-N 
 (DJ talking) 
 Get on down mothafuckas to the cool rockin' mello sounds of the Unholy, so I want everybody to just get on down. 
 Pump that shit up 
 You could die, and I really wouldn't give a fuck 
 I honestly can say 
 I don't give a fuck bout nothin' but get paid 
 Take it how you wanna take it 
 Money, make it how you wanna make it 
 I'm not frontin on the facts man 
 It's just like that 
 Flip them burgers or flip them cracks 
 'Cause it really doesn't matter to me 
 My pockets gettin' fatter you see 
 Fuck this and fuck that 
 I lay my beats down on an ill track 
 Make you wanna bite it like a cookie 
 Suckas on the mic just rookies 
 Kick that acid, drop it on your tongue 
 Or just pass it to get on down 
 (DJ talking) 
 Get down, get on down 
 Hold up, wait a god damn minute 
 After I fuck this beat I'm a nut in it 
 I'm droppin' no babies jack 
 No if, and's, or but's or maybe's jack 
 I fuck beats all day 
 Nut in the speaker so it bumps the right way 
 Call me Unholy 
 Holy I'm not, cross me and get shot 
 Motherfuck a preacher 
 Fuck college, without dollars they don't teach ya 
 Shit but how to be broke 
 And when ya get broke it's all just a big joke 
 Their all gonna laugh at ya 
 And tell ya black ass to go back to Africa 
 Your nothin' but a fuckin' clown 
 What your funky ass needs to do is just get on down
