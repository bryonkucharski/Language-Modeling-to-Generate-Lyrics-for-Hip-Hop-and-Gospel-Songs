 15a - Unhappy 
 "(I was dreamin' when I wrote this, so don't quote this. Watch me flow this.) 
 Unhappy... 
 When you live your life in misery 
 And you so blind 
 Can't see 
 Nothin' but sufferin' 
 Tired of strugglin' 
 Hustlin' 
 Barely gettin' by 
 I can't lie 
 Sometimes it make me wanna cry 
 Hold back the tears inside 
 Keep all my fears inside 
 And my pistol by my side 
 So much anger and aggression 
 > From manic-depression 
 I grab my Smith and Wesson 
 This is just another lesson 
 I feel like God is testin' 
 I'm steady askin' questions 
 'Cause I'm unhappy 
 Unhappy (x19) 
 Unhappy... 
 When you unhappy like me 
 A problem's never solved 
 You never get involved 
 The whole world revolves 
 Around doctor's diagnosis 
 With symptoms of insanity 
 Mental casualty 
 It's sad to see another tragedy 
 Blasphemy 
 Thinkin' too deeply 
 Forever sleepy 
 A subliminal criminal 
 In the darkness, you can't beat me 
 Pacsel 
 Lithium pills 
 Benadryl 
 Askin' God to forgive me 
 I guess this how I was sent to feel 
 When he unhappy 
 Unhappy (x19) 
 Unhappy... 
 I'm sick and tired of bein' sick and tired 
 Fallin' in fire 
 Feels like my body is wrapped in barbed wire 
 I don't give a fuck no more 
 And I just can't take no more 
 How the fuck am I supposed to not to bake a cake no more? 
 And the only thing that's left is love 
 'Cause I can't hate no more 
 So, if you gonna kill me, do it 
 'Cause I just can't wait no more 
 Rappers dyin' from rapid fire 
 It just ain't safe no more 
 Time waits for no man 
 And I just can't waste no more 
 Steady lookin' at my mistakes 
 I can't erase no more 
 Demons fallin' from the sky 
 This ain't no holy place no more 
 God, I swear I'll never put you in second place no more 
 'Cause I don't wanna see that look on your face no more 
 Drugs, I don't chase no more 
 That ain't the case no more 
 And I finally don't wanna be a disgrace no more 
 A guinea pig to this world's rat race, no more 
 Russian Roulette in the face with a .44 
 I'm unhappy 
 Unhappy x19) 
 Unhappy..."
