I know you hate me bitch 
 'Cause I ain't rich 
 And I'm tryin' to get mine 
 Fuckin' with my mind 
 And I know you don't mind 
 What's yours is mine 
 And what's mine is mine 
 Let me do some time 
 If I find you switch 
 Then I gotta slap you 
 Bitch bitch, suck my dick 
 Till the funk in my trunk 
 That I packed to the mack 
 Play back, play back, spit it back 
 Rude boy, roughneck white duck 
 9 dead bodies then my bitch turns up 
 Lately you've been trying to play me 
 In a mental state G 
 Wait G 
 I know you hate me 
 I know you hate me 
 I know you hate me 
 Bitch 
 I know you hate me hoe 
 You still can't let it go 
 Hey yo 
 Bitch take a check before you get ship wrecked 
 And I snap your fuckin' neck 
 I ain't had 'em dat 
 Bitch, hoe, stank booty freak 
 Nuts in your mouth 
 Stretch marks on your cheeks 
 Ya say I ain't the same 
 Ya say I'm actin' strange 
 Well bitch I'm still the same motherfuckin insane 
 I'm crazy like a wannabe 
 I'll shut your fuckin' mouth up 
 Jump on ya stomach till ya cough ya fuckin' lunch up 
 (Esham argues with his old girlfriend) 
 I know you hate me 
 To be or not to be a bitch 
 A bitch, why you gotta be a bitch 
 Dumb hoe, workin on an ass kickin 
 Get yo ass in the kitchen and cook this chicken 
 Bitch or I'll slap you upside the head 
 Hoe have you ever seen a burnin bed 
 I ain't playin' 
 Know what I'm sayin' 
 Hoe you better act right 
 I ain't against fuck you up like a street fight 
 All in all in I think you've fallen 
 911 bitch get the call in the cops 
 Or better yet call homicide 
 Cause somebody in here just died 
 I know you hate me 
 I know you hate 
 I know you hate me 
 I know you hate 
 I know you hate me 
 I know you hate me!
