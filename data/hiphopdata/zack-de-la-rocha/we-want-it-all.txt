There they are now 
 The master of law 
 Throwing flowers on a casket of our broken dreams 
 Most thieves are silent 
 But these ones scream 
 These ones scream 
 We want it all 
 We want it all 
 I heard you talkin' my friend 
 I think you lost your mind 
 That somebody's listenin' 
 And then biding their time 
 Somebody's watchin' 
 'Cause we wouldn't fight 
 For someone else's war 
 Could you hold on a second 
 For a second someone's at my door 
 Screaming hate is love 
 And fiction is fact 
 Honesty is deceit 
 That silence is security 
 And war is peace 
 'Cause we want it all 
 We want it all
