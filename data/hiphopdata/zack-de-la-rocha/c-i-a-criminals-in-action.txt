(KRS-One) 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah! 
 KRS-One comin' through, Big Zack, Last Emperor 
 WOOP WOOP! Ha hah, that's the sound of EMS 
 Ha hah, Last Emperor, KRS 
 Ha hah, Big Zack you know the rest 
 Now we gonna come down like this now, hold tight all crew 
 Listen! 
 (Zack de la Rocha) 
 This voice shatters the calm of the day, like an alarm 
 To wake up battered youth, and take up arms 
 Cause more is necessary than vocabulary war 
 Cause the toxic rock imports, gettin' on your door 
 C.I.A. I see ya later, cause your time is comin' soon 
 I flip the shit like, Pacino and it's your Dog Day Afternoon 
 Attica Attica, drug agents you bring your static-a 
 My alphabet will slash that neck and flip you, automatica 
 Dramatic, like Ali Shaheed Muhammed brought The Vibe 
 I bring the sun at Red Dawn to pull the thoughts of Frantz Fanon 
 So stand at attention, devil dirge 
 You never survive chosin sides against the wretched of the Earth 
 The infiltrator, child intoxicator, people incarcerator 
 Liberation movement annihilator 
 We got you clocked pushin rocks and it fail 
 We got brothers troopin subways like the Ho Chi Manh trail 
 We got the truth data, Last Emperor, KRS and 
 History manifested, tomorrow the next lesson 
 Chorus: all together, with samples 
 You claim I'm sellin crack, but you be doin' that 
 "You, claim, you claim, you, you claim, claim 
 You, claim I'm sellin crack, but you be doin' that" --> KRS 
 (Zach) You know the cops they got a network for the toxic rock 
 You claim I'm sellin crack, but you be doin' that 
 "So get that flashlight out of my face" 
 "You, you, you claim I'm sellin crack, but you be doin' that" --> KRS 
 (KRS) The Last Emperor, KRS-One, and Big Zack 
 (The Last Emperor) 
 As free market capitalism and technology expands 
 The third world's fertile soil becomes a desert wasteland 
 So it takes bands to, demand the, government provide answers 
 When Lady Liberty has me Bewitched like Samantha 
 And poverty is one of the most malignant forms of cancer 
 To all my Black Magic romancers and acid rain dancers 
 Develop close ties like Jerry Seinfeld and George Costanza 
 We fear no man and throw jams that attack counterintelligence programs 
 Exciting like the epic adventures of Conan (hah!) 
 I colonize minds like Zaire by the Belgians 
 Now what the hell is the problem with this system and what it sells us 
 I bring ancient relics like Wyclef did to Zealots 
 I saw an Iron Curtain called hip-hop and got it open like Boris Yeltsin 
 Whirlwind, tornadoes, in the rain forest if you say so (whosssshhh) 
 KRS and The Last Emperor like the Green Hornet and Kato 
 Zach de la Rocha brings the enraged flow, but all three drop science 
 And become the most powerful alliance since NATO 
 Chorus: all together, with samples 
 You claim I'm sellin crack, but you be doin' that 
 "You, claim I'm sellin crack, but you be doin' that" --> KRS 
 You claim I'm sellin crack, but you be doin' that 
 (Zach) You know the cops they got a network for the toxic rock 
 You claim I'm sellin crack, but you be doin' that 
 "So get that flashlight out of my face" 
 You claim I'm sellin crack, but you be doin' that 
 (KRS) The Last Emperor, KRS-One, and Big Zack 
 (KRS-One) 
 Need I say the C.I.A. be Criminals In Action 
 Cocaine crack unpackin, high surveillance trackin 
 Prominant blacks and whites givin' orders for mass slaughters 
 I want all my daughters to be like Maxine Waters 
 When they flooded the streets with crack cocaine 
 I was like Noah, now they lower cause the whole cold war is over 
 Communism fell to the dollars you were grabbin it 
 All the assault and batterin in the name of intelligence gatherin? 
 Now it's karma you battlin, a losin fight 
 I chose the mic to recite ignite light in the night, aight? 
 We should beat em, President Clinton should delete em 
 It's not hard, the C.I.A. simply has no more job 
 Oh my Goddess, mother, you can fix this 
 We rock over mixes not six six sixes 
 Yo this is, the message, to all that can hear it 
 If you got secret information now's the time to share it 
 Call your Congresswoman, your senator, your mayor 
 It's time for all the scholars to unite with all the players 
 Rearrangin, see times are definitely changin G 
 They used to tap the phone, now they tappin while you pagin me 
 It's crazy B, yet it's plain to see, who the enemy 
 Who's left the NRA? The ATF, the AMA? 
 Okay okay, it's all irrelevant, cause in the new millennium 
 There'll be no Central Intelligence 
 Uh, yeah, uh, yeah 
 Throw your hands up 
 You know whassup kid, throw your hands up 
 Ha hah yeah, hah hah, yeah
