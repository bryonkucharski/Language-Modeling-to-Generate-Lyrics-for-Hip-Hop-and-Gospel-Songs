I need an overdose of life 
 My secret to survive 
 To get a big kick out of live 
 I always go against the tide 
 I burn so fast but bright 
 And never see the red light 
 Don't keep your eyes on every step I take 
 Don't restrict me in every move I make 
 I want to be free 
 Just take your hands off me 
 I gotta be free 
 No-one else can live my life for me 
 Despite of any consequence 
 Whatever makes no sense 
 I hold the whole world in my hands 
 And when I feel I'm out of sight 
 The chemical delights 
 Will lead me safely through the night 
 Don't tell me what I'm supposed to do 
 I am the only one who pulls me through 
 I want to be free 
 Why don't you let me be 
 I gotta be free 
 Oh, why can't you just see 
 I want to be free 
 Just take your hands off me 
 I gotta be free 
 No-one else can live my life for me 
 Don't steal the air from every breath I take 
 I don't give a shit for all the rules I break 
 I want to be free 
 Why don't you let me be 
 I gotta be free 
 Oh, why can't you just see 
 I want to be free 
 Just take your hands off me 
 I gotta be free 
 No-one else can live my life for me
