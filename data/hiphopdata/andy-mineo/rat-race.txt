Hook - Jon Bellion: 
 Tell 'em we don't wanna play, yeah, yeah 
 We're so okay with last place 
 We already won the game, yeah, yeah 
 No, we won't run your rat race 
 This is so disrespectful 
 I'm sorry that I didn't do it sooner 
 They talkin' that manure 
 Snakes comin' for my head, that's Medusa 
 But watch how I maneuver 
 I ain't fly, man, I'm lunar 
 I got no time for high opinions with them low commitments 
 I hear that chatter from a distance, I don't ever listen 
 Cause art critics just artists that never made it 
 What I care what you sayin', I'm too busy creatin' 
 I could tell that ya' some crabs, hatin' on the low 
 Tryna shoot my dream down, cause you never chase your own 
 I think I struck a nerve, matter fact I hit a bone 
 I got a word for them rappers who swear that they on the throne 
 Oh, so you the king of rap, where your kingdom at? 
 I got a queen, a fly one, sittin' on my lap 
 You bought the lie them rappers told ya, I bring it back 
 That's all I gotta say 
 Roof your ball, I don't wanna play

 It's so disrespectful 
 Hip-hop raised me, I'm talkin' back to my parents 
 I dropped that Never Land, yo, I still haven't landed 
 Look mama, you don't gotta drop it low if you raisin' standards 
 Raisin' this banner, mama raised me with manners 
 Couldn't put me in a box, how I'm raisin' this brand 
 It's hard to stay focused with standin' in front of cameras 
 But they don't understand it, they don't see that from my vantage 
 All glory to the Most High all the praise be 
 Got them other rappers sweatin' like they need the AC 
 It ain't all 'bout who you know, Bleek knew Jay-Z 
 If it you ain't HOT 97, bad idea tryna play me 
 I know dudes with so much money that it ain't funny 
 Type of money make you laugh at jokes when it ain't funny 
 Type of money, go outside lookin' bummy 
 Still bag a supermodel, they don't care if he ugly 
 There's politics in this game, but ain't no politicians 
 And I ain't tryna be another one of fame's victims 
 Make a name for myself but never make a difference 
 Now, that's all I gotta say 
 Roof your ball, I don't wanna play 
 Yeah, roof your ball, I don't wanna play 
 Yeah, you ain't ever seein' that again 
 No, I roof your ball, I don't wanna play 
 Yeah, no 
 Kiss it goodbye 
 Kiss it goodbye 
 Killin' me Smalls 
 Kiss it goodbye
