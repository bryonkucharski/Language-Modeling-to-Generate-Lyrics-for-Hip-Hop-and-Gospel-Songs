Why is it so hard to love you? 
 Why is it so hard to love you? 
 You make it easy, but I make it hard 
 Oh my God 
 You take the blame when I don't deserve it, no, no 
 I break your heart, then I do it again, do it again 
 You give me patience when I keep you waitin' 
 I don't know why you call me your favorite 
 Are we for real or not? (tell me, tell me) 
 For real or not? (tell me, tell me) 
 Are we for real or not, I gotta know 
 (Tell me, tell me) 
 You're givin' me all you have 
 You saw me without my mask 
 But I can't change my past 
 So can you promise this gon' last? 
 Mac Powell: 
 Make me a believer 
 Cause all I've ever seen is pain 
 Make me a believer 
 Promise me I'm not the same 
 Make me a believer 
 They tell me seein' is believin' 
 But all ever saw was the schemin' 
 All I ever saw was the people that I loved 
 They was gettin' up and leaving, throwin' peace signs 
 What's up, what's up, aye 
 What's up lately? 
 How did you love me? 
 You stayed when I went buggin', you stayed 
 It's messin' with my head now, it's messin' with my head 
 Why you haven't left now? 
 I still can't guess, tell me 
 Are we for real or not? (tell me, tell me) 
 For real or not? (tell me, tell me) 
 Are we for real or not, I gotta know 
 (Tell me, tell me) 
 You're givin' me all you have 
 You saw me without my mask 
 But I can't change my past 
 So can you promise this gon' last
