It's kinda crazy, it's kinda crazy that your name is Grace 
 Your name is Grace 
 Cause that's what I need, that's what I need right now in this crazy place 
 It's crazy, crazy, crazy 
 It's not that I did somethin', it's the fact that I didn't 
 And I'm so ashamed it took twenty-five years just to get it 
 Cause people made fun, and I just laughed with 'em 
 But that was me as a child 
 I just pray you forgive me 
 Hear my heart beat, hear my heart beat 
 Hear my heart 
 (x2) 
 I remember your son graduation 
 That's when I met your friends 
 And they was all havin' conversation 
 But they was sayin' stuff that I couldn't understand 
 Then all of a sudden it felt like, I understood something I missed my whole life 
 For the first time I was wearin' your shoes 
 For the first time I was hearin' your views 
 I never knew how complicated life is when you feel so isolated 
 And I know we don't speak much 
 'Cause when talking got hard all I ever did was throw the peace up 
 My big sister Grace, I'm sorry I never learned to sign 
 And even though you were born deaf 
 I pray you forgive me for the years I lived blind 
 Sometimes, sometimes these words aren't enough 
 So let me show you, let me show you 
 Sometimes, sometimes these words aren't enough 
 So let me show you, let me show you 
 It's kinda crazy
