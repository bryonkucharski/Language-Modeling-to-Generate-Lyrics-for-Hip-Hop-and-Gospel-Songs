Mali Music: 
 You know I'm a wanted man 
 For reasons you won't understand 
 Prices on my head, for like a hundred grand 
 'Cause I'm wanted dead or alive 
 (Bang, bang!) 
 You woulda thought I was whippin' and pushin' and sellin' this dope 
 (Bang, bang!) 
 The way that they tell me to get out of town and then aim for throat 
 (Bang, bang!) 
 They tryna ghost you boy, they pullin' the gun out the holster 
 (Bang, bang!) 
 But I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me like I'm 'posed to, yeah! 
 You're smart 
 Out here like the Wild Wild West 
 Shorty right there with the wild, wild dress 
 They tell you can be more if you show less, hol' up 
 I been around the block a few times, I got a new mind, I'm lit 
 Man, I was sleepin' on futons, bread small as crutons 
 Now my business legit 
 How many beats do I got to poop on to prove I'm not a fluke? 
 I want true, a true sign a growth 
 For you find ways to refine yourself 
 You win when you lose, aye! 
 Seem like every team them got a Judas 
 But I don't care 
 Give me a snake and I'll make a nice pair of boots with, yeah 
 I ain't tryna be liked, man, I'm tryna be a light, bang! 
 I ain't tryna make a livin', man, I'm tryna make a life, bang! 
 Ayo, that's way different 
 Nowadays I pray different 
 Used to ask for mo' blessings 
 Now I thank Him for the ones He givin' 
 Hook - Mali Music: 
 You know I'm a wanted man 
 For reasons you won't understand 
 Prices on my head, for like 100 grand 
 Now they want me dead or alive 
 Bang! 
 They gunnin' for me now 
 Bang! 
 They got they weapons drawn 
 Bang! 
 They say get out of town 
 'Cause I'm wanted dead or alive 
 How do you terrify a man that is scared to die 
 So while I got a mic, I'm a air the lies that paralyze my people 
 I live by the fear of God 
 I'm sick and tired of songs that don't dignify a lady 
 But, baby we givin' them power 
 The moment you go out and buy it and give 'em yo' dollars 
 Why they try to define us by how many commas we got? 
 They don't know what's inside us 
 But let me honest, there's something beyond us 
 Yo, homie, preach! 
 I gotta speak on my peace 
 Man, I can't keep it a secret 
 The only way that you get acceptance is when you know you don't need it, yeah 
 Freedom is a mindset, and I ain't in my prime yet 
 Minor League and one sixteen, yeah 
 Them my folk I prime with 
 I think about all that time spent way before success 
 Get to see the kid shinin', that's the glimmer from the sweat 
 Get up and go 
 Homie, we live by the code 
 We don't got minutes to blow 
 Time is more precious than gold 
 Sharp with the flow 
 Mix it with lyrics that fix up your soul, oh 
 I ain't tryna be liked, I'm tryna be a light, bang! 
 I ain't tryna make a livin', man, I'm tryna make a life, bang! 
 All right, now we some desperados 
 Livin' by the motto 
 If I die tonight, man, I'm ready for tomorrow 
 They say get out of town 
 The truth won't let me lie though 
 They gunnin' for me now 
 They know the way I go 
 They want me dead or alive 
 I'm wanted dead or alive 
 I'm wanted dead or alive 
 I'm wanted dead or alive 
 I'm wanted dead or alive 
 I'm wanted dead or alive 
 I'm wanted
