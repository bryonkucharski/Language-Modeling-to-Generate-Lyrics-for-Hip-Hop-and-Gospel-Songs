MartyMar: 
 You can't stop me 
 Andy Mineo: 
 Huh, can't stop won't stop, where the brakes at? 
 I give 'em that diddy bop, like take that, take that, take that, take that 
 I'mma put in work, I'mma do that ASAP 
 Throw my faith in rap, but they say don't say that huh? 
 What I'mma turn down for, I feel like Shaq in nine four 
 Breaking glass in that backboard, or like Kobe in Toronto, huh? 
 Dropping 81, Yo I drop the 88, Ricky Bobby, shake and bake 
 Sleeping on us should have stayed awake, huh? 
 Everybody make mistakes like VJs trying to say my name 
 It's Mineo, say it with me, Mineo - Okay great 
 Two forks high, raise the stakes, risk it all, I take the hate 
 It's the winning team, get the Gatorade 
 My God good, but he's not safe, nah 
 Andy Mineo and Marty of Social Club: 
 They try to shut us down, and it ain't gon' slide 
 Only thing I fear is God and he on my side 
 That's the confidence of God, 'cause he got me 
 That's why I really feel like 
 You can't stop me 
 That's all you got? Come on with it 
 That's all you got? 
 You can't stop me 
 (You) don't got the power, (can't) shut me down 
 (Stop), that's not an option, I'm my biggest problem 
 (You) don't got the power, (can't) shut me down 
 (Stop), that's not an option 
 You can't stop me 
 Andy Mineo: 
 You're my biggest opponent, you know me I know you we know it 
 Whenever I fail, you've always been there to simply remind me I've blown it 
 You don't see when I'm growing, you don't see where I'm going 
 You only see in the moment, you know my mistakes you never let go it 
 Huh, don't cease to amaze me, and it drive me crazy, huh 
 That you catch every detail that I miss in the songs I'm making, saying 
 You will never write a verse like Kendrick 
 Never be to rap what rock got from Hendrix 
 Top 10 alive you will never be mentioned 
 Why aim so high, won't survive the trenches 
 Plus, you a Christian Andy, they will never listen Andy 
 Plus, well your pigment Andy, huh, you don't got skill you a gimmick Andy 
 Well, if I listen to you, and everything you put in my ear 
 I'll be living like woulda, shoulda, coulda, I'll be paralyzed by fear 
 Huh, ain't that the truth, if I quit the only way I lose 
 I got two choices when I do this - make moves or make excuses 
 Huh, if you know who I'm talking about, then you got me 
 My biggest enemy is me - and even I can't stop me 
 Andy Mineo: 
 I said if I cannot stop me then you'll never stop me 
 Oh no, can't stop, oh no, won't stop
