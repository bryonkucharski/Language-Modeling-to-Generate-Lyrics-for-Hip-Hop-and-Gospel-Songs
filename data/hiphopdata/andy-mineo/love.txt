What we got if we don't got (love, love, love) 
 What we got if we don't got (love, love, love) 
 What we got if we don't got (love) 
 Sorry to keep y'all waitin' 
 Album was supposed to drop, I had a situation 
 Me and this fine thing started datin' 
 I spit game, but I wasn't playin' 
 I threw a ring on it, found (love) 
 Shoulda seen the celebration 
 20k in savings, yeah, that's some preparation 
 Suit was handmade, 5,001 flavors 
 Fallin' in love is easy, buildin' it takes patience 
 That's (love) 
 Man, that covetin' commitment 
 Not the type that's lookin' like a business 
 On some, I give you what you need just to get what I need 
 So when I'm givin' it to you, I'm really givin' to me 
 That's not (love) 
 I'm talkin' 'bout the real stuff 
 That kind that make vulnerable and reveal stuff 
 That kinda dealin' with your pastor, get healed stuff 
 Fellas say they real tough, but nothin' braver than (love) love 
 Yo, what we got if we don't got love 
 Everybody searchin' for 
 And everybody need that love 
 (Love, love, love) 
 And nothin' more timeless than (love, love, love) 
 Two-steppin' in the name of (love) 
 It's no word more abused than "you" 
 Sometimes I be gettin' lust confused for you 
 Watch a man real close, what he choose to do with his money 
 That'll tell you the truth about what he really (love) 
 Ayo, you're more than just a feelin' 
 You're more like a action 
 More like a decision 
 You listen even when somebody think different 
 Don't insist on gettin' your own way, that's no way to (love) 
 Cause of you I told my boy he was trippin' 
 Even though I knew it bring friction 
 I tell the truth without you around, nobody listen 
 Yo, how you celebrate a blessin' when you ain't get it, that's (love) 
 You motivate my whole mission 
 When I think about God, you the definition 
 Yo, why I never see you hang with the religions? 
 I feel you when you know I'm forgiven 
 I, I, I love (love) 
 You been so gracious and been so patient 
 You don't throw them past mistakes up in my face 
 You remind me no matter the skin we one race 
 If you had a daughter, I bet her name would be Grace 
 'Cause you're (love, love, love) 
 You're love 
 Yo, what we got if we don't got (love, love, love) 
 And everybody searchin' for (love) 
 And everybody need that (love) 
 Yeah, cause nothin' more timeless than 
 Two-steppin' in the name of 
 What we got if we don't got
