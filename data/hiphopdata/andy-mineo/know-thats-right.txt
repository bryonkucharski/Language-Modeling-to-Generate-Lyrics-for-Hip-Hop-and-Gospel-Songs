If you stay ready 
 You ain't gotta get ready 
 All ready 
 Yeah, y'all ready? 
 Look, if you stay ready 
 You ain't gotta get ready 
 All ready 
 Look, y'all ready, I'm ready 
 Y'all ready 
 I, I go for that, I get it 
 Came in this game, me and 'Crae on a mission 
 I found a blue, that's club livin' 
 But I ain't see too many of y'all livin' 
 Seem like everybody tryna fit in 
 Livin' that life like a highlight reel 
 That ain't real 
 They ain't tell you 'bout the sweat they spilled 
 How they got no chill just to get it 
 I'm livin' the high life (never land) 
 High art for the Most High 
 My wife in them high heels 
 Ooh, high five! 
 That's nice 
 You know, you know that's right 
 And I don't got fans, I got family 
 I'm on my Chief Keef, y'all don't understand me, squad! 
 There's nothin' left to say 
 I know where I'm goin' 
 We're startin' here today 
 And you know, you know that's right 
 You, you know 
 You know that's right

 My Savior is Jewish, my lawyer is Jewish 
 My stomach is Buddhist 
 I'm trying to lose it, but I need to chill on Fig Newtons, I swear 
 I don't sweat the money, only the music 
 Now I got the juice, and my words got influence 
 That's power to use it and I don't wanna blow it 
 First off, rap lied to us 
 Y'all ain't figured that yet? 
 They got the whole world tryna ball out 
 How you ball so hard but you still got debt? 
 I don't respect anybody that's trying to flex 
 Y'all lookin' the weakest 
 'Cause I was with a billionaire last week and the boy had Payless sneakers on (get money) 
 My homegirl started strippin' 
 I said, "Chill, get your degree" 
 She told me, "Andy you trippin', cause you don't make more money than me" 
 Well, you know that's right 
 But some money always come with a price 
 I love this life, but I'm sure what I got next, to die for 
 There's nothin' left to say 
 I know where I'm goin' 
 We're startin' here today 
 And you know, you know that's right 
 You, you know 
 You know that's right 
 (x4) 
 You know that's right [x3] 
 There's nothin' left to say 
 I know where I'm goin' 
 There's nothin' left to say 
 I know where I'm goin' 
 Nothin' left to say 
 I know where I'm goin' 
 I'm goin', I'm goin' home
