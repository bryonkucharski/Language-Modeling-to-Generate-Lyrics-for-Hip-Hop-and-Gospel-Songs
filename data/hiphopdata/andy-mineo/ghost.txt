What you even come around for? 
 You ain't have my back even when I had yours 
 We said we'll take the whole world over 
 You couldn't even tell me what's wrong 
 Still think about it though it's been so long 
 Thought we'd be down forever, now you're gone 
 I remember, I remember 
 It wasn't many days that we didn't chill together 
 We was hangin' in my dorm room, we would write them rhymes 
 Then record 'em in my closet 'cause we was next to shine 
 Even had our own handshake, fall into that hug 
 And we was different colors, but we swore that we were blood 
 And, uh, all of a sudden you deaded everyone 
 I had to find out through the internet you had a son 
 And when I text you won't hit me 
 This music took me all around the world, you were s'posed to go with me 
 But, uh, the thug changes and love changes 
 And them best friends become strangers 
 I knew what Nas said was true 
 I just never thought it be about you 
 But, um, people come, people go 
 And when they leave it's like they took a piece of your soul 
 It's sorta like a ghost 
 I didn't know you could walk through walls 
 I didn't know you could float 
 I didn't know you could disappear 
 I guess you were a ghost 
 Ghost 
 Ghost 
 We used to be so close 
 I pray I don't get used to this feelin' 
 The closer you are, deeper the cuts, longer the healin' 
 These feelings and insecurity, they circle 
 I just walk around like ain't a soul on this earth that's hurtin' me 
 I do this for protection 
 When I feel rejected I just dead 'em first, man 
 Somebody bring the hearse in 
 My worst fear in life is that my wife would have the urge to leave 
 Like everybody else start desertin' me 
 I know we made vows, but I cannot believe when I see divorce rates 
 You know why I got doubts 
 Fear takin' control 
 Seein' it, now I know 
 To truly love a person, the bravest act of the soul 
 I could either get my heart again, put it in the open 
 Or lock it in a box where it never be broken 
 But there it grows cold, lifeless and old 
 Nobody could come close but it's safe 
 Protected from the ghost 
 I didn't know you could walk through walls 
 I didn't know you could float 
 I didn't know you could disappear 
 I guess you were a ghost 
 Ghost 
 Ghost 
 We used to be so close 
 What you even come around for? 
 What you even come around for? 
 What you even come around for? (let it go, let it go, let it go) 
 What you even come around for? 
 You ain't have my back even when I had yours
