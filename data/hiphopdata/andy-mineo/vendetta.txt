I told you so 
 I told you 
 We are the ones 
 Cause 'Pac did a lot more for me than Barack 
 Salute 
 La, da-da, da, da, da, da, da 
 We're not afraid to lose everything we got 
 Cause all we really got is our word, word, word 
 The pen is greater than the sword 
 La, da-da, da, da, da, da, da 
 By the people, for the people 
 Seems like you only look out for your sort of people 
 I look around, it's more evil 
 God I see it in me 
 You see, um 
 Everyday we closer to that funeral 
 Everyday a struggle, but the struggle still beautiful 
 And doctors don't got patience for their patients 
 So they just send them to that pharmaceutical 
 We tell 'em that they need drugs 
 But I know that they need love 
 I ain't scared of that war or the violence 
 The thing I'm more terrified of is [-silence-] 
 I wanna snatch my generation out this apathy 
 Gotta do that now 'fore this voice grow out of reach 
 And what we feedin' people that's a tragedy 
 So what you want, the chemicals or calories? 
 Nobody taught us how to eat 
 Momma gon' work the sixty hour weeks 
 What's for dinner? 
 Well, what's quicker and cheap 
 You got remote parents, you'll be raised by the TV 
 My momma worked the night shift 
 Still made it out to every single game 
 While my father sat at home 
 I promise when I have my own that we will never be the same 
 Vendetta 
 I told you so 
 I told you 
 We are the ones 
 Cause 'Pac did a lot more for me than Barack 
 Salute 
 La, da-da, da, da, da, da, da 
 Look, Mr., Mr. or Mrs 
 Government official, we just won't listen 
 You can't relate to how we livin' from where you're sittn' 
 That's why the artist got more influence than the polititian 
 This my generation 
 We know the news never tell the truth so we go to Twitter for our information 
 It's so fast, y'all seem slow to us 
 By the time you print it tomorrow it's old to us 
 We are the ones that you used to be, brave idealists with a dream 
 That went corrupted by the cream, yeah 
 This pen is not for sale 
 They nickel and dime'n 
 We still throwin' quarters in a wishing well 
 And I know you can't imagine losin' the lifestyle that you so used to havin' 
 And, yo, we still make decisions for the fact that they awesome 
 Not just for the profit margin 
 Hold up, how I'm talkin'? 
 I got excess, others got need 
 I gotta answer to God for all of these sneaks 
 I got a hundred pairs, but only two feet 
 God forgive me, I've been thinkin' 'bout me 
 We point fingers at people who sin different, skin different 
 But the same color we bleed 
 You wanna know the real problem in America? 
 Always has been and it always will be, me 
 If you had any other answer you've been deceived 
 We've been lookin' for salvation in education, money, leaders, and policies 
 But we got a bigger need 
 We got a sin debt that we inherited 
 We divide ourself by class, skin color, and our heritage 
 Well our Creator bankrupt the heaven so that we could all be there with Him 
 Brothers and sisters 
 I told you so 
 I told you 
 We are the ones 
 Cause 'Pac did a lot more for me than Barack 
 Salute 
 La, da-da, da, da, da, da, da
