From the day that I saw you 
 I knew that we would pursue 
 Cause the chemistry 
 We felt that day 
 Felt so real, and so true 
 Looking back on a year 
 We spent together 
 How it's been, what 
 We went through 
 Although we've had our 
 Little ups and downs 
 We've still pulled through 
 Baby girl you're my 
 World my everything 
 I wanna lace you with 
 Diamonds and every ring 
 Give you everything you 
 Dream and fantasize 
 Cause you can tell me 
 That you love me 
 Looking in my eyes 
 You keep it real with me, 
 I keep it real with you 
 You keep on loving me, 
 I'll keep on loving you 
 Keep doing what you do, 
 I feel your whole aura 
 And I can't wait to hook up 
 Again tomorrow baby - what 
 My love for you will never end 
 You'll always be a part of me 
 As long as time keeps 
 On passing by 
 You'll always be my baby boy. 
 Everytime I look at you, 
 I can't believe 
 I've found a love so true (and) 
 I took my time to put 
 My trust in you 
 I must admit it was so hard to do 
 And every minute that I 
 Spend with you 
 You make me believe I 
 Have nothing to lose and 
 Deep down I always knew 
 That you would be mine 
 Do you believe in destiny 
 Because I got a funny feeling 
 This was meant to be 
 Without you I'd be lost, 
 I need you next to me 
 Preferably in the house full 
 Of luxuries and little kids 
 From day one I was sprung, 
 Knew you was gonna be one 
 Cause my heart spoke for the 
 Very first time in a long while 
 And every time you smile, I can see us walking up the aisle with you 
 Carrying my child C'mon 
 If you were to go, I don't know 
 You're the only one who 
 Sweeps me off my feet 
 Makes my soul go weak 
 The only one who makes 
 My heart wanna beat and I, 
 I could never live without you 
 You know that what I feel 
 Has to be true 
 'Cause you're my, my sweet love 
 Ever since the first time, 
 That I looked into your eyes 
 I knew that you were 
 Gonna be mine 
 Feeling you from the inside, 
 When you're not by my side 
 You're the only girl 
 That's on my mind 
 I never knew a love like 
 This, a love so strong 
 A vision so picture perfect 
 It could never be wrong 
 Along the way, you're gonna 
 See you belong with Jay 
 I might have to marry you 
 One day baby eh... 
 (Chorus / Outro)
