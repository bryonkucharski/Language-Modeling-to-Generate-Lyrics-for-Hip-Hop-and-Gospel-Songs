This is the way I live 
 Lil' Boy still pushin' big wheels 
 I stack my money, lay low, and chill 
 Don't need to work hard, that's the way I feel, I feel, I 
 This is the way I live 
 Lil' Boy still pushin' big wheels 
 I stack my money, lay low, and chill 
 Don't need to work hard, that's the way I feel, I feel, I 
 This is the way I live 
 Six months later now we're big dog status 
 Name elevated but I still act average 
 Rockin' shows in Dallas, ballin' like I play for the Mavericks 
 West Bank rapper and I'm one of the baddest 
 French Riviera spot and I'm getting in shape man 
 I think I'm Super m-a-n without a cape man 
 Ridin' all day hustlin'; all for the cake man 
 I'm a Benjamin stack, one inch taller than Great Danes 
 First they made cheap Ray Ban like a felon 
 I'm growin' up now spittin' hotter than Mohellans 
 And I'm still living good, never gon' too fly 
 I'm a young little dude, stay runnin' from cops 
 Emerald Row is the place where I got my props 
 People love me in da hood, they don't want me to stop 
 So uh, that's the only way I know how to rock 
 And I'm a stay rappers like I ain't gon stop till I drop 
 This is the way I live 
 Lil' Boy still pushin' big wheels 
 I stack my money, lay low, and chill 
 Don't need to work hard, that's the way I feel, I feel, I 
 This is the way I live 
 Lil' Boy still pushin' big wheels 
 I stack my money, lay low, and chill 
 Don't need to work hard, that's the way I feel, I feel, I 
 This is the way I live 
 I's Baby Boy and I done it again 
 I'm ridin' fly with D-Wizzle in the 'cedes Benz 
 Twenty two wanna ride with the ladies then 
 Red Bull, Grey Goose, now the ladies bent 
 Now we go and do a thing under a shady tent 
 And they don't question what I say 'cause I'm a ladies pimp 
 See this little one right here? This fellow got stripes 
 And I's gon represent, my rail room for life 
 Money in my pocket, but I still act trife 
 While in da club they say the parlor ain't right 
 Look I'm doing great and that's the way I feel 
 Hustlin' hard all day and that's the way I live 
 This is the way I live 
 Lil' Boy still pushin' big wheels 
 I stack my money, lay low, and chill 
 Don't need to work hard, that's the way I feel, I feel, I 
 This is the way I live 
 Lil' Boy still pushin' big wheels 
 I stack my money, lay low, and chill 
 Don't need to work hard, that's the way I feel, I feel, I 
 This is the way I live 
 Hey, hey, it's the two-seat rider with the ketchup inside 
 Red pepper paint must believe my shit ride 
 They pause like stop signs when they rollin' up 
 'Cause when the doors open up, they open up 
 I'm Lamboin' it, I was stashed, off stage I'm throwin' it 
 My niggas say I'm like Katrina with money, I blow the shit 
 Real been gravy, three years out of da eighties 
 Solos, shabo's valley animals played it 
 Commodores' mirages, not the Nike Huaraches 
 It cost 250 on up to put your foot inside this 
 Y'all was wearing rocks that was my time to shine 
 Don't give me Viesels y'all thinkin' this McDonald's size 
 I been fly-i-i-i from the crib to the ri-i-i-i-de 
 Fifty-Four inch screens, 26 inches from the ceiling 
 Dude, the plasma look like a projector up in da livin' room homie 
 This is the way I live 
 Lil' Boy still pushin' big wheels 
 I stack my money, lay low, and chill 
 Don't need to work hard, that's the way I feel, I feel, I 
 This is the way I live 
 Lil' Boy still pushin' big wheels 
 I stack my money, lay low, and chill 
 Don't need to work hard, that's the way I feel, I feel, I 
 This is the way I live 
 Ho, this is the way I live 
 Ho, this is the way I live
