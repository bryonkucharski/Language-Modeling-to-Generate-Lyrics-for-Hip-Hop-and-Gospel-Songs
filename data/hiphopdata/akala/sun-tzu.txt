Any which way some of you want to come through 
 I'm ready for you like Sun Tzu 
 Ready for you like Sun Tzu 
 Ready for you like Sun Tzu 
 Any which way some of you want to come through 
 I'm ready for you like Sun Tzu 
 Ready for you like Sun Tzu 
 Ready for you like Sun Tzu 
 The art of fighting without fighting 
 Or fighting when you need to 
 It's appealing, we're peaceful but demons if we need to 
 Equal whatever you bring we'll meet you 
 This sport is a war with a discourse 
 Which thoroughbred horse make it through this course? 
 Which emcee shall I chew up for this course? 
 Same energy known for the sick tours 
 No hype man, breath control 
 Record a track I do the same thing live 
 Can't do that? Ah bless your soul 
 You ain't ready for the Shaolin vibes 
 Wake up when it's still dark in the sky 
 With the heart for the grind and an art full of rhymes 
 And the sharpest of lines and a spark of the mind 
 So bright that I'm leaving them partially blind 
 Any which way some of you want to come through 
 I'm ready for you like Sun Tzu 
 Ready for you like Sun Tzu 
 Ready for you like Sun Tzu 
 Any which way some of you want to come through 
 I'm ready for you like Sun Tzu 
 Ready for you like Sun Tzu 
 Ready for you like Sun Tzu 
 Don't be foolish 
 What you want to test I for? 
 I'm a man on a mission 
 Don't let I catch you slipping 
 It's no competition 
 I've been studying the art of war 
 It's the hardest of times we're living in, isn't it? 
 So why ain't you disciplined just a little bit? 
 Little git, wanna throw a little hissy fit? 
 Here's a question, tell me can you riddle it? 
 Does it take effort to make yourself really shit? 
 Or is that your best that you're giving it? 
 Nah, it can't be 
 Well, rhyming just ain't for everyone 
 Now every little son of a gun seems to think 
 From the moment they come out their mum they are the one 
 Without ever having what it takes to become 
 Ten lifetimes ain't enough 
 I was a griot, I was a Sufi 
 I was a Mayan priest but not in the movies 
 I was a druid pouring out fluid 
 Blessing the ancestors 'cause we come through them 
 Hundred more times I was born before 
 Before The Windrush came and Britain forever changed 
 Energy and memory it remains 
 In my veins and it don't take much to reclaim 
 All I gotta do is say my own name 
 And the power of Greyskull reigns 
 Yes, ruthless student, nuisance mutant 
 Trains with the Shaolin monks, I'm reclusive 
 Name is a thousand thumps with a pool stick 
 That reigns on a silly little punk for the bullshit 
 Game for a round, punch and we all kick 
 Elbows, knees, let's go for the full kit 
 Tell your G's I'll believe that they're all sick 
 When I see degrees they achieve, we're talking 
 A school called wisdom, you could go there anywhere 
 Yet you are never there 
 Any which way some of you want to come through 
 I'm ready for you like Sun Tzu 
 Ready for you like Sun Tzu 
 Ready for you like Sun Tzu 
 Any which way some of you want to come through 
 I'm ready for you like Sun Tzu 
 Ready for you like Sun Tzu 
 Ready for you like Sun Tzu 
 Don't be foolish 
 What you want to test I for? 
 I'm a man on a mission 
 Don't let I catch you slipping 
 It's no competition 
 I've been studying the art of war 
 It's the art of a warrior, heart of a foreigner 
 That's living in an all-white town from a toddler 
 Graft that your body does half wanna honour us 
 But you've gotta tell them that you're past wanting followers 
 A class for the coroners, who the ras wanna collar us? 
 Kill rate way past choleras 
 Look at all the revellers, look at what a rebel does 
 Sekkle, metal can't settle us 
 Dope, but the CIA can't peddle us 
 Nope, we go for the throat what you telling us 
 Choke, on the little hope that you're selling us 
 Joke, I take Britain like Severus 
 Cult, it's the occult and its elements 
 They wanna reign high but we come to be levelers 
 We know the design and we're done with the evidence 
 Go with the times get bun for the hell of it 
 Any which way some of you want to come through 
 I'm ready for you like Sun Tzu 
 Ready for you like Sun Tzu
