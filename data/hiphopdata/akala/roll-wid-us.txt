It's my time like it or not gotta ride can't fight 
 This thing'll take you with it like a landslide 
 My mind spitting rhymes refined as old wines 
 No games since age 5 I hold mine 
 Never fell for the spells they tell in this world 
 I read Malcolm, you was learning to spell 
 I took exams early with the geeks in the school 
 Opened a business you were still chasing your balls 
 I spent my teens sticking but I'm one of Britain's best mathematicians 
 Official, I got the certificate 
 So however you want it kid we could do scholarship politics 
 Or the opposite 
 War with hollow tips No supathug, just I don't fear, why would I? 
 You bleed like me and breathe the same air 
 I got a purpose on this earth 
 And I ain't ready to go 
 So if I gotta send you first then let it be so 
 Roll wid us or get rolled over 
 Roll wid us or get rolled over 
 Roll wid us or get rolled over 
 It's time now the wait is over 
 Roll wid us or get rolled over 
 Roll wid us or get rolled over 
 Roll wid us or get rolled over 
 It's time now the wait is over 
 It's bigger than the music 
 It's more like a movement 
 A unit a trueness spreading like rumors 
 They foolish, say I can't do it they doubt 
 'Cause we acorns now just watch out for the tree that sprouts 
 When it does, remember I told you 
 I'm going from local to global 
 Poor and hopeful 
 From gluing back shoes 
 'Cause they showing my toes through 
 To owning shoe companies and yards on the coastal 
 If you real grab on, I'm taking the fam with me 
 But hold on tight 'cause we movin' real swiftly 
 Fakes can't stop my flight 
 Not your life that's like 
 Trying to fight atomic war with a knife 
 Fight like mike with control not physically 
 If ignorance is bliss that explain my misery 
 I'm clear in my vision b, solve your mystery 
 Compete with me you get whitewashed like black history 
 Roll wid us or get rolled over 
 Roll wid us or get rolled over 
 Roll wid us or get rolled over 
 It's time now the wait is over 
 Roll wid us or get rolled over 
 Roll wid us or get rolled over 
 Roll wid us or get rolled over 
 It's time now the wait is over 
 It's not all gravy, man dem is shady 
 Tings is crazy but that don't phase me 
 It's not all gravy, man dem is shady 
 Tings is crazy but that don't phase me 
 Get yours, there's only one life to live 
 You gotta feed your kids, you gotta eat real big 
 Young soldier you can do whatever you want to 
 And no one out there can stop you 
 Not sure just watch me for practice 
 In these board meetings 
 Taking cheese off crackers 
 You actors are not factors 
 I see the bluff 'cause you sell crack 
 It does not mean that you're tough 
 It's the matrix and it's blatant you paper thugs are not ready yet 
 For getting unplugged 
 Grown man still talking like 
 You know who I am, where I'm from' 
 Bredren what the fuck are you on? 
 Telling the world who you shot 
 And what are you earning 
 When you get popped that will not stop it from burning 
 So it's worthless, you gots to be a soldier 
 Watch me grind you'll understand it as you get older 
 Nothing pretty but when I do things the job's over 
 Never stick at that critical moment, I'm potent 
 I'm focused, you jokers can't see me 
 I feel like a marksman at point blank it is too easy
