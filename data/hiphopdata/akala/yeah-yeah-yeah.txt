There's a lot of talk, who flow the meanest 
 Work it out; it don't take a genius 
 I spit my thesis talkin' ceases 
 Rappers act sick and I got the treatment 
 Expose actors, similar to a cinema 
 Similar to a Derringer 
 Your wack tracks ain't got skills 
 Add to that the fact that you're not real 
 Talk bout gats, say make caps peel 
 But they fake raps - you get slapped in ya grill 
 Stop lyin' to buyers, I'm tight as pliers with the science, hahuh 
 The roughest rhymin', tough as diamonds, fuckin' blindin' 
 You must be high as kites 
 Figure you can fuck with the nicest 
 I'm off the scale, like Hampstead house prices 
 So hot, the sun seem cold 
 So hot, the flow boil liquid nitro 
 What ya hearin', the best thing since bread slice 
 Nigga with charisma, that would turn a dike 
 That's why I've had more blows than opponents 
 Hoes don't know how I flow 
 I blow out opponents and mics 
 I'm oh-so nice 
 It's Not A Rumour, it's the truth blood so 
 If he's talkin' like he's hard 
 Don't believe him, pull his card 
 Tell him... yeah, yeah, yeah... 
 If you've really had enough 
 That's OK, call his bluff 
 Tell him... yeah, yeah, yeah... 
 And if your boss is talking shit 
 And you really wanna quit 
 Tell him... yeah, yeah, yeah... 
 Anybody, anywhere 
 Chattin' rubbish in ya ear 
 Tell him... yeah, yeah, yeah... yeah, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah... 
 They say I think I'm the best, I'm far too arrogant 
 I ain't the best; I'm beyond comparison 
 Think ya good, but you're not 
 Couldn't get close to me inside a phone box 
 Why spit? You're a dipshit without diction 
 Plus your whips and your clips is fiction 
 That much of a killer? 
 Why you lyin'? I think you're Porky-Pieing 
 If ya had dough, you should own shit, not sign it 
 I think you're Porky-Pieing 
 Tryna' be G when you're soft as PeeWee 
 That greezy talk see through to Stevie 
 I mean it, believe me, to me it's easy 
 You find it hard, I can hear from your CD 
 I'm the best, can't put it more simple 
 Plus pretty thug, women love the dimples 
 I been had gyal, like Saddan or Bin Laden 
 I'm kinda like a pimp, but no mink dragging 
 I'm a nigga's nightmare- like ya ting jamming 
 A skinny little nigga with the heart of a dragon 
 Unstoppable, Mission Impossible 
 Logical, I'm the one- ask the Oracle 
 Legend like Christ and the 12 Apostles 
 Got more lines than Whitney's nostrils 
 If he's talkin' like he's hard 
 Don't believe him, pull his card 
 Tell him... yeah, yeah, yeah... 
 If you've really had enough 
 That's OK, call his bluff 
 Tell him... yeah, yeah, yeah... 
 And if your boss is talking shit 
 And you really wanna quit 
 Tell him... yeah, yeah, yeah... 
 Anybody, anywhere 
 Chattin' rubbish in ya ear 
 Tell him... yeah, yeah, yeah... yeah, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah... 
 If you a baller cool, rap about 
 But there's no Puffs in England 
 So shut ya mouth 
 It amazes me, these rappers are so dumb 
 Get they advance and think they Trump 
 See I spit like guns, tongues speed of a chopper 
 I don't really care, you're a shotter 
 Youth, dem a blow ya brain out 
 'Cause ya got ya chain out 
 So what real good is a name now? 
 Watch no face, trust me father 
 Young never dumb; that's not Akala 
 The Don Dadda, dun flow badda 
 Walk tall as a ladder, and I talk with swagger 
 Everything I do, poetry in motion 
 Deep, like a puddle to me is the ocean 
 'Cause convulsions, like voodoo potions 
 Ramp with the Sultan, I find that insulting 
 That's a Nova racing a Ferrari 
 You're little clique takin' on the army 
 Be a legend when I die, like I was Bob Marley 
 Marcus Garvey or Muhammad Ali 
 'Cause I'm droppin' knowledge, like Oxford scholars 
 Not bad, considering I didn't finish college 
 I'm here now, your noise is void 
 All you so called 'Hot Boys' paranoid 
 No paragraphs parallel, this is Paradise 
 I'm a paragon, leave you parasites paralysed 
 My parables parachute here to Paraguay 
 It's paramount you don't fuck with I 
 The flow kicker, go-getter 
 Show ripper, pro-spitter, natural-born winner 
 Sicker than liquor in livers 
 Iller then Jack-the-Ripper killers 
 Give riddims big as a gorilla nigga 
 These bitter niggas bicker 
 But I'm bigger than that 
 I'm tryna' fold figures, big as Jigga and that... 
 I'm focused maaan... 
 If he's talkin' like he's hard 
 Don't believe him, pull his card 
 Tell him... yeah, yeah, yeah... 
 If you've really had enough 
 That's OK, call his bluff 
 Tell him... yeah, yeah, yeah... 
 And if your boss is talking shit 
 And you really wanna quit 
 Tell him... yeah, yeah, yeah... 
 Anybody, anywhere 
 Chattin' rubbish in ya ear 
 Tell him... yeah, yeah, yeah... yeah, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah...
