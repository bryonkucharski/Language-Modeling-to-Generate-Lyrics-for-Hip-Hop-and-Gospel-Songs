(Murder, murder) 
 (Murder, murder) 
 (Murder, murder) 
 (Murder, murder) 
 (Murder, murder) 
 (Murder, murder) 
 (Murder, murder) 
 (Murder, murder) 
 Every shot that thunders 
 Through the nighttime don't you wonder 
 What potential was extinguished 
 To keep the flames burning under? 
 Through the underworld and over world 
 Principles are so the same 
 Though we pretend they're not as if they do not control cocaine 
 But you'll find it's connected 
 Every kid in the hood that's living with a death wish 
 Is the same as the King who kills for the bling 
 But he is just much more reckless 
 It's the King that I'm talking about 
 Though he is born with a silver spoon in his mouth 
 He still gonna clap for the slightest of chat 
 At any world leader that can't back it 
 If he is sitting on the boxes 
 They are just oil or mineral deposits 
 Food he is moving fucking with our profit 
 So he better stop it 
 They say money makes the world go round, but it don't 
 That is just not true 
 If you ain't got guns to protect that money 
 I'll regret that, Sonny, it is more fool you 
 Only murder further agendas that money couldn't force 
 Eliminate the foes who propose 
 To suppose a different course, of course 
 A little torture is usually a big supporter 
 Though there's nothing quite like killing 
 Good riddance to non supporters 
 We demonize the man on the corner 
 Paint him as a thug 
 We worship murder so much 
 It's just that he ain't killed enough 
 You wanna commit murder 
 But not end up in cuffs? 
 You gotta make it to the Premier League 
 A thousand murders plus 
 Who said money makes the world go 'round? 
 They just didn't know 
 Murder runs the globe 
 M-m-murder runs the globe 
 Every knife that puncture lungs of sons 
 Don't make you wonder Mums? 
 If he was born to billionaires backed by a hundred guns 
 Would he be living still, drinking, sleeping, eating meals? 
 Instead of dead where it don't count 
 We expect you to be killed 
 Because living as a pauper is a fate that is tainted 
 Acquainted with torture 
 We ain't debating the rape of the daughter 
 If she was raised in particular borders 
 Place that fate made particular slaughters 
 No fate just particular orders 
 It's the way of the world no accident 
 In fact it's immaculate 
 You got a big gun start clapping it 
 'Cause the language of power devour quick 
 Any silly biddy little pacifist or activist or challenges 
 Brown or black skin savages 
 Who inhabiting land with minerals in it 
 Who think for a minute that the rhetoric we spoke 
 Hope? Was not meant to be a joke 
 Don't dream compassion will happen it won't 
 Just go straight for the throat 
 Because any nation or races 
 That prove themselves incapable 
 Of matching modern murder machines 
 Make themselves enslavable 
 It is murder not money we desire insatiable 
 The thrilling of the killing it's million dollars sensational, yes! 
 What you can't do with a bribe 
 Can be achieved in a breeze with a gun and a knife 
 Because only murder further agendas that money couldn't grind 
 Nothing like a couple dead kids to change a parents' mind 
 Who said money makes the world go 'round? 
 They just didn't know 
 Murder runs the globe 
 M-m-murder runs the globe 
 Let's get a little clarity 
 You ain't got the capacity to internationally 
 Have a say in the ways things happening 
 You expect to collect more battering 
 Your arsenal it ain't got no nukes 
 Armies equipped with too few troops 
 We're laughing at you when you call truce 
 It's part of the ritual to shoot-shoot-shoot 
 You got no background in colonization 
 Or public resource privatization 
 You can't bang with the big boys, face it 
 But you still wanna play like Satan 
 You got no death squads to call your own 
 Or a pilot to fly your drones 
 Much less bulldozers for their homes 
 Talk gangster and you want to name Al Capone? 
 He was an amateur, silly little boys don't understand 
 Even he went jail for tax evasion 
 For missing a payment in the payment plan 
 To the man, one with invisible hand 
 And a hidden fist to enforce my plan 
 I am just because I can more wicked than the Summer of Sam 
 Kick your shit and I kick mine fam 
 You bust your gun and I bomb your land 
 Only murder further agendas that money can't control 
 Nothing like a massacred village to get the problem solved! 
 Who said money makes the world go 'round? 
 They just didn't know 
 Murder runs the globe 
 M-m-murder runs the globe
