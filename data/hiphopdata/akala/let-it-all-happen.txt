Existence is resistance in a world that 
 Thinks the human instinct should be held back 
 And all of our wisdom we we should sell that 
 Destroy the difference that we all have 
 And make use clones for the throne 
 Serving their agendas 
 Even when we think we oppose 
 We're really their defenders 
 Look at what is given to those 
 Who chose for their repentance? 
 To fold to the goddess of gold and be cold henchmen 
 For stars spangled with banners 
 That dangles cars as carrots 
 Strangle Mars with cannons 
 Mangle arms with malice 
 And channel arms so callous 
 And banish bards that challenge 
 And challenge half the planet 
 The great USA 
 With a British dog on a leash 
 We are the bringers of peace into the Middle of East 
 You are invited to Feast 
 On the tasty flesh of a beast 
 It might be someone's seed 
 But why worry there is no need 
 We intravenously feed 
 On dead carcasses 
 Yeah they're starving 'cause 
 They wanted to own their own wealth 
 And they are not part of us 
 Most of the time I think of myself 
 And I can palm it off 
 Sometimes I think of the world 
 It gets me started off 
 So so what do we do now 
 Make ways that praise more than a few how? 
 Their fake ways we kill it with a tool blaw 
 Or go back to the way we've always done it 
 Whatever we do there's always gonna be division 
 Whatever we do there will always be a thieves' religion 
 Whatever we do they're just gonna build another prison 
 So let's just do nothing and let it all happen 
 Whatever we do the universe just keeps on giving 
 Whatever we do the Earth will always keep on spinning 
 Whatever we knew we still won't understand beginnings 
 So let's just do nothing and let it all happen 
 Existence is resistance in a world that 
 Thinks the human instinct should be held back 
 And all of our wisdom we should sell that 
 Destroy the difference that we all have 
 Every freedom we believe we're receiving this evening 
 But believing is deceiving 
 When there's no meaning 
 In not a syllable 
 However how lyrical 
 Spouted from the mouths of a clout 
 Devout criminals 
 Hegemony is as old as humanity right? 
 So we're told 
 So let us scramble for the globe until everything folds 
 As long as pockets always have enough dollars to fold 
 As long as rockets always have enough venom to scold 
 A daddy's daughter 
 A mother's son 
 Or anyone 
 That has not come to succumb to a murderer's tongue 
 So we're told 
 Worship a gun 
 From the palace of permanent slums 
 Purchase a ton 
 From whoever will sell you the Sun 
 And sell it back to whoever can give you the funds 
 The race is run 
 But I don't know if we lost or we won 
 It's all perception, death and resurrection 
 A lack of answers won't stop as asking the question 
 So so what do we do now 
 Make ways that praise more than a few how? 
 Their fake ways we kill it with a tool blaw 
 Or go back to the way we've always done it 
 Whatever we do there's always gonna be division 
 Whatever we do there will always be a thieves' religion 
 Whatever we do they're just gonna build another prison 
 So let's just do nothing and let it all happen 
 Whatever we do the universe just keeps on giving 
 Whatever we do the Earth will always keep on spinning 
 Whatever we knew we still won't understand beginnings 
 So let's just do nothing and let it all happen 
 Existence is resistance in a world that 
 Thinks the human instinct should be held back 
 And all of our wisdom we should sell that 
 Destroy the difference that we all have 
 Resisting the system? 
 Please tell me what's the mission 
 'Cause we would probably be oppressors 
 If given position 
 Yeah I try to spread a message, but really ambition 
 Is what is driven through my lyrics 
 I'm really a gimmick 
 Not that I don't put my heart and my soul in the words 
 It's just I ask 
 If the bars are changing the Earth 
 How arrogant to believe we can change it 
 Through art 
 Only slightly less arrogant than those 
 Who believe that we can't 
 So pull a bit harder 
 We may just crumble the house of cards 
 Never to slumber it's strength in numbers 
 Whenever we charge 
 There is a charge, lays these bars lace the guitars 
 Aim for the stars 
 Game for the part, straight as dart, pain from the heart 
 Great for the art 
 Start fighting 
 Or never should ever you pen to the page 
 Start writing 
 Or never should ever you empty the gauge 
 Murder a phase, verbally slayed 
 The coroner could not determine his age 
 Hard as a foreigner earning a wage 
 From the conservative nerd of a sage 
 Not heard? I'm a permanent page 
 Written in the ink of the blood of a slave 
 No cotton so burn on a wage 
 Buried at the bottom of the ocean of rage 
 Existence is resistance 
 So so what do we do now?
