Water cuts rock, so which has more force? 
 As water shapes the land, it's still willing to change it's course 
 So can't even change your own minds? Usually change nothing 
 Can't ever blame your own mind? Always blame something 
 But in failure, hides opportunity 
 In divided communities still residing is unity 
 Waiting to show itself soon as we're ready to see it 
 Truth is always there, soon as we are ready to be it 
 So we can keep pretending what's real is just the senses 
 But it is all the same when you're looking with stronger lenses 
 So concerned with images, but it's there in the words 
 Images are just imagination, that's what's so absurd 
 Have you heard the Pig now knows it's fat? 
 And the Zebra is confused because it's white and it's black? 
 So what's fact, right and exact when everything changes 
 Change the way you look at the world, the world changes 
 Instead of reasons to die, find a reason to live 
 Instead of reasons to fight, find a reason to give 
 Instead of reasons to talk, find a reason to sing 
 Instead of reasons to take, find a reason to bring 
 Instead of reasons for I, find a reason for we 
 Instead of reasons to try, find a reason to be 
 Instead of reasons to look, find a reason to see 
 People, I am pleading, find another reason 
 We are so busy noticing money don't grow on trees 
 We forgot that food does and that it's the food that we need 
 You see, I done traveled all over the Isles 
 And seen the poorest people with the wealthiest smiles 
 So what is Rich or Poor, Less or More? 
 What's victory? What's defeat? And who keeps the score? 
 Who sleeps more soundly, the Prince or the Pauper? 
 Who speaks more profoundly, the Professor or just the talker? 
 The walker or the driver, who travels the furthest? 
 The explorer or the pirate, who is providing a service? 
 Who decides what is worthless, versus what has a purpose? 
 Did the so-called civilized world not think the earth a flat surface yesterday? 
 So, who knows what tomorrow brings? 
 It often is the oddest of songs that tomorrow sings 
 Look back through the ages, everything changes 
 Change the way you look at the world, the world changes 
 Instead of reasons to die, find a reason to live 
 Instead of reasons to fight, find a reason to give 
 Instead of reasons to talk, find a reason to sing 
 Instead of reasons to take, find a reason to bring 
 Instead of reasons for I, find a reason for we 
 Instead of reasons to try, find a reason to be 
 Instead of reasons to look, find a reason to see 
 People, I am pleading, find another reason 
 We find all these reasons 
 To never be the person we want to be 
 Because I'm still healing 
 All these wounds that are buried 
 So deep inside of me 
 We think that we're smart and that makes us dumb 
 Think that we feel the most and that makes us numb 
 Weak because we're convinced that we have the power 
 Because we can make buildings and guns, but not a single flower 
 We're just waves but think we're the ocean 
 Because it's easier then admitting 
 We don't know where the current is going 
 We're just flowing 
 Why do we feel it needs controlling? 
 Waves just rolls with the ocean until they reach the sand 
 So let's roll with our part, until we reach our land 
 Acknowledge that the fear in our hearts, totally in our hands 
 It's not a thing, we just think 
 Imagine the Earth decided that it was afraid to spin? 
 So don't be afraid, to sing with your voice 
 That's what it is for 
 The more we run from truth, the closer it gets to your door 
 Look back through the ages, everything changes 
 Change the way you look at yourself, the self changes 
 Instead of reasons to die, find a reason to live 
 Instead of reasons to fight, find a reason to give 
 Instead of reasons to talk, find a reason to sing 
 Instead of reasons to take, find a reason to bring 
 Instead of reasons for I, find a reason for we 
 Instead of reasons to try, find a reason to be 
 Instead of reasons to look, find a reason to see 
 People, I am pleading, find another reason
