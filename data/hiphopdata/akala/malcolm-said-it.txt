 I weren't there but I'm sure Dessalines said it 
 If you ain't found something to die for 
 If you ain't found something to die for, you'll never live 
 If you ain't found something to die for you'll never live 
 We might feed and breathe but we never did 
 Except those with peace and equality 
 That don't see what we call authority 
 Live and speak truth and kill them for 
 We love them dead when they speak no more 
 But they will endure, ideas are bulletproof 
 Tooth of truth it's impossible to pull it loose 
 We smother any mouth, they utter it 
 Folly Fathers fear, we Mother it 
 We're lovin' they're corrupt government 
 So we look the other way when in our name they're strugglin' 
 We idolize 'em and we despise 'em 
 'Cause we're reminded we're the ones who are silent 
 So, give a moment for the times we were blinded 
 Scream at the top of your lungs like a siren 
 If you ain't found something to die for 
 If you ain't found something to die for, you'll never live 
 Maybe the wise man has nothin' to prove 
 But the one who has nothing has nothing to lose 
 More things we don't need will make more thieves 
 More laws we don't heed it's all Siamese 
 Who leads? It don't matter, they can't make change 
 New driver but we got no brakes 
 Whatever the place, whatever the face 
 The master never ever frees his slave 
 They always knew it 
 So they pursue it 
 But we've been too divided to ever be guided through it 
 Gotta stop 'em because they're rotton from the days of picking cotton 
 To sell us a love song and we're so besotted 
 So confused, we believe their promise 
 But there are some that lead more honest 
 They are not forgotten, though they shot'em 
 So scream to the top of your lungs right from the bottom!

 If you ain't found something to die for 
 If you ain't found something to die for, you'll never live 
 People don't rebel, the rebels are the tyrants 
 You are not God, so we are not defying 
 No human nature, just our behavior 
 The oppressed wanting their oppressor as their saviour 
 Around the globe killin', made to be religion 
 But the book said they're sinnin' 
 And that is just the beginnin' 
 Now spread democracy by dropping a bomb 
 On a terrorist with no shoes or socks 
 I reckon, history teaches us a lesson 
 The bigger terrorist is the one with the bigger weapons 
 They talked but we didn't listen 
 They spoke and then went missin' 
 We can't see all the things that imprison us 
 'Cause we don't appreciate the freedoms that they have given us 
 I wouldn't bet it, that we ever get it 
 Run, tell your friends that Akala said it 
 If you ain't found something to die for 
 If you ain't found something to die for, you'll never live
