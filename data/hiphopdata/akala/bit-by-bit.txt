No more bluffing it's, I'm a feel it in my belly button 
 I'm a glutton for your blushing your sweet little nothing 
 Your discussion and your fussing and your face when your cussing 
 Even when your wrong and no one can tell you nothing 
 I'm addressing to the fact that, I can put my trust in 
 Man sexy but it's more than disgusting 
 My rushing, my gushing and when we push each others buttons 
 Love you, so what's love time even when we Fucking 
 Glutting for your stuffing n I want another clubbing 
 Feenin' for your loving your hugging and back rubbing 
 But, every so often I feel like I'm stuck in 
 We don't give each other space, push each others buttons 
 One can't speak shit without the other one buttin' 
 We talk a lot of shit but it don't mean nothing 
 I say that I'm fucking but you no that I'm bluffing 
 Listen for a minute baby let me tell you something 
 Let's take it slowly... bit by bit 
 Just get to know me... bit by bit 
 I know we're not perfect but... bit by bit 
 I know that we're worth it... bit by bit by bit 
 Take it slowly... bit by bit 
 Just get to know me... bit by bit 
 I know we're not perfect but... bit by bit 
 I know that we're worth it... bit by bit by bit 
 Every time that we sinning I feel that I'm really winning 
 When we finished and I'm grinning and I'm bringing another innings 
 We just fulfilling the mission we're reliving 
 I feel that I'm giving back myself that was missing 
 I'm more like I'm drilling to myself that was hidden 
 I'm a villain and I'm wicked but I'm also really timid 
 I'm rigid and I pivot but I'm careful not to fidget 
 Stick with it, I'm tryna get close to your spirit 
 It's kinda like a riddle, I'll figure your just a little 
 A wolves turned pit and throw me, in the middle 
 The shirt comes down by your neck just a little 
 It ain't even hot but you sweating just a little 
 I feel like I might of found my wife just a little 
 Kinda like I understand life just a little 
 We can spend time, together, more than a little 
 You wanna stay forever do my thing just a little 
 Let's take it slowly... bit by bit 
 Just get to know me... bit by bit 
 I know we're not perfect but... bit by bit 
 I know that we're worth it... bit by bit by bit

 Just get to know me... bit by bit 
 I know we're not perfect but... bit by bit
