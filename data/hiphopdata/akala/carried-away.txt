Another hearse roll up slow 
 Carry one more poor lost soul 
 Carry them things every single day 
 'Cause it makes him feel safe 
 'Cause he carry on them ways, screw face 
 Love the game, reppin' his estate 
 Talk tough look straight in his face 
 Carrying deep pain, self-hate 
 Carry fam, so he carry weight 
 It's logical daddy got carried away 
 Not married away, just didn't stay 
 This Coward carried his son to this fate 
 His boys carrying weight in a wooden box 
 Can't stand straight 
 They was getting outta the game 
 But look fate she don't wait 
 Now the woman in the front row, her face 
 Show no pain 
 But her brain went insane on the day the 
 News came 
 Stare into space, face numb 
 The boy getting carried, she carried 9 
 Months 
 When this world strip me naked, I turn and 
 I face it 
 And really believe I have the strength to 
 Change it 
 I'm crazy, it's blatant sometimes I get 
 Carried away 
 When this world strip me naked, I turn and 
 I face it 
 And really believe I have the strength to 
 Change it 
 I'm crazy, it's blatant sometimes I get 
 Carried away 
 One more body bag getting carried back 
 From the war zone where they carry 
 Straps 
 Where little kids is attacking tanks 'cause 
 They carry no fear of the man 
 All they know here is they land 
 And a hero, gotta make a stand 
 So they roll cold with it in their hand 
 Let it bang on the big bad man 
 But this particular soldier never move 
 Colder 
 Never enrolled to blow no homes up 
 Felt that life had carried him under 
 Chose to phone the number 
 The army gives you training 
 Nothing they say could really explain it 
 Sign them papers, enslavement 
 Now you're a tool to carry their hatred 
 Rob, steal, strip a nation 
 All he wanted was qualifications 
 So he could carry his family places 
 Better than those that he was raised in 
 Never really thought, he'd ever have to go 
 To war 
 Now who's gonna tell his kids daddy can't 
 Carry them no more 
 When this world strip me naked, I turn and 
 I face it 
 And really believe I have the strength to 
 Change it 
 I'm crazy, it's blatant sometimes I get 
 Carried away 
 When this world strip me naked, I turn and 
 I face it 
 And really believe I have the strength to 
 Change it 
 I'm crazy, it's blatant sometimes I get 
 Carried away
