Can I take you back for a minute 
 It's not just lyrics 
 I live it I'm spillin' my spirit 
 On the beat like streets cold as blizzards 
 Late night drownin' my sorrow in a bottle of spirits 
 Was a sweet child, that character's missing no trace 
 Now it's bora in coat and screw face 
 Colder, soldier, angry young male 
 Don't ask how, you already know the tale 
 Never lived with my father 
 Nasty break up with my mum and her partner 
 And of course, times was harder 
 Moms did her best with the strength she could muster 
 But she so stressed it was us that would suffer 
 Plus school teachers hate me, say that I'm feisty 
 Play all kinda mind games to try break me 
 Helped turn a innocent kid, into a ignorant pig 
 Fuck 'em anyway, I still got straight A's 
 Winter was real, no gas 
 I went to bed in full clothing 
 Back when my world was closing in and mom was sick 
 I can't explain the pain when the news came 
 Sorta like the blizzard that came after the rain 
 My mind was a prison, I visioned the worst 
 Ran home from school, wanted to get there first 
 Didn't want either of my sisters, to find what I pictured 
 Moms was too strong, she just soldiered on 
 Dad, I ain't mad 
 Don't think I don't understand 
 But I still had to learn how to be a man 
 Standing on my own two, not the way you supposed to 
 Funny how the cycle repeats 
 Nobody showed you, Wouldn't believe I told you what I had to go through 
 Pressure couldn't fold me, but turnt my heart cold G 
 What don't kill you make you strong supposedly 
 That must be why nobody can hold me 
 Yeah I had a struggle, but really it's sugar-coated 
 When you think of all the millions barely living and hopeless 
 In the news Mother and child, bellies bloated 
 Put yourself in their shoes, knowin' death is approaching 
 But it's not fate, it's bait, they were thrown in 
 The deep end of the endless ocean of man's sin 
 Politics, religion, man philosophize 
 Got technology and television 
 Still don't know why the worlds a weight on top of your shoulders 
 But we fold up, true we can't hold up them boulders 
 I been through the shit, but came out like roses 
 I'm blessed, don't ever think I don't notice 
 I know I got a path, but it's hard to stay focused 
 Specially on these roads, where foes are like roaches 
 Foul and I crush 'em and I won't even notice 
 If I lose my way, I just want you to know this
