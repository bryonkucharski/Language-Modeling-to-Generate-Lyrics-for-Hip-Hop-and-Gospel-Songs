Peace is on the way 
 Peace is on the way 
 By the sword they say 
 After this, this last blow, last chop 
 Last drop 
 Peace is on the way 
 After this, this last scream, last shout, last trample of boot 
 Just one more, one last rubble wreck where once were dreams housed 
 Last plane, last flame, last sky 
 Peace is on the way 
 Just one more naked Vietnamese girl 
 Be she Russian, Israeli, Palestinian or Great Great, Great, Really Great British 
 Just one more placard wielding warrior and this last sword-slinging gunman 
 Just one more song of machine-gun metal hurtling Death to outrun life 
 Just one more war 
 Then we can have peace 
 Then we can have peace
