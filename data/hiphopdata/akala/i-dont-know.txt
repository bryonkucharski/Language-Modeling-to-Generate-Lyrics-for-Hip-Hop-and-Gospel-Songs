They say ignorance is bliss 
 Never a truer word spoke 
 Half the answers only bring more questions that we'll never know 
 Even the wise man knows he don't know much 
 Still not wise enough to accept it as such 
 So we chase the questions seeking direction 
 Every time we think we're right get a swift correction 
 Whether Muslim or Jew really don't matter which 
 You can't buy tomorrow no matter how rich 
 We all bleed and breathe and take shits 
 And chase the same answers 
 Though some think are better equipped 
 But with all the test tubes and test and so-called best 
 They still don't know 
 A theory is just a posh word for a guess 
 Because you're in a skyscraper don't make you different 
 From those in huts along the Amazon 
 And not more significant 
 We're all the same all rise all fall 
 But those on high horses have the furthest to fall 
 The moon and the stars 
 Fast women and cars 
 Is this world truly ours? 
 Or are we just entertainment 
 Chasing it all we rise and we fall 
 Said I don't know 
 The moon and the stars 
 Fast women and cars 
 Is this world truly ours? 
 Or are we just entertainment 
 Chasing it all we rise and we fall 
 Said I don't know 
 They say ignorance is bliss never believe it 
 Those who don't learn from history are condemned to repeat it 
 Truth you gotta seek it, wherever its hidden 
 Or else you'll find yourself dancing to someone else's rhythm 
 Mental prison is the worst kind 
 You can take my liberty but my mind is mine 
 Whatever they controlling, never let your brain close in 
 The mind is like a parachute, it only works when it's open 
 Smoking gun but they say they never shoot 
 No such thing as a fruit without root 
 Truth not being told will never make it go away 
 A lie told a thousand times can never take it's place 
 They say it's fate, but take a proper view 
 They're trying to hold so many destiny's in their hands 
 They're bound to drop a few 
 So the more we keep moving, the better chance we got 
 Everybody knows a rolling stone gathers no moss 
 The moon and the stars 
 Fast women and cars 
 Is this world truly ours? 
 Or are we just entertainment 
 Chasing it all we rise and we fall 
 Said I don't know 
 The moon and the stars 
 Fast women and cars 
 Is this world truly ours? 
 Or are we just entertainment 
 Chasing it all we rise and we fall 
 Said I don't know 
 They say ignorance is bliss, well I ain't got a clue 
 All you gotta do is whatever that works for you 
 But when 6 billion individuals looking out for number 1 
 And we got to share the same sun 
 That's when the troubles come 
 That brings us back to where we started 
 Face to face with the cold-hearted facts 
 That there are no answers 
 My head all of this chit-chat 
 I don't even smoke 
 But I'ma go have a spliff and just kick back 
 The moon and the stars 
 Fast women and cars 
 Is this world truly ours? 
 Or are we just entertainment 
 Chasing it all we rise and we fall 
 Said I don't know 
 The moon and the stars 
 Fast women and cars 
 Is this world truly ours? 
 Or are we just entertainment 
 Chasing it all we rise and we fall 
 Said I don't know 
 You know, don't ask me 
 I'm not a prophet 
 I'm not the answer 
 I'm just a rapper 
 A little boy from North London 
 What you've heard for the last 40 minutes 
 It's my opinion 
 My thoughts, my feelings 
 It's not right, it's not wrong 
 It's just what it is 
 It's just Akala
