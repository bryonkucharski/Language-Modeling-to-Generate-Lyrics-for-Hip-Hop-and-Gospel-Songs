How do we, how do we find our way? 
 How do we, how do we find our way? 
 Talk fights wars 
 Silence is never to blame 
 Talk's forever changing 
 Silence is always the same 
 Talk likes to play 
 But silence is not a game 
 Talk only confuses 
 Silence only explains 
 So they talk 
 And talk and talk and talk a lot 
 But behind their talk is not 
 Any action 
 That goes with the rhetoric 
 Its bullshit even if you ain't smelling it 
 The word is the word 
 Even if you're misspelling it 
 If there's a heaven 
 There's a hell in it 
 If it exists, they're selling it 
 Got no riches? then tenements 
 Is where you live, with relatives 
 That's just good biz, development 
 Selling a wedding a funeral, sell 
 The ugly the beautiful and the unusual, sell 
 A life, a death, a dress an address 
 Or a desk or a pound of flesh 
 All is acceptable, not regrettable 
 When we make a person a decimal 
 Line syllable rhyme typical 
 Would it be better to mime lyrical 
 I'm just giving you my individual 
 Spin on the things that I've seen in the physical 
 I wanna know 
 How do we, how do we find our way? 
 When they have, so many things to say 
 How do we, how do we find our way? 
 When they have, so many things to say 
 Talk is the fool 
 Silence is always the wise 
 Talk is the rule 
 Silence is only a guide 
 Talk is the tool 
 But silence is in the mind 
 Talkings mostly the cruel 
 Silence is mostly the kind 
 See they say so many things 
 But then they clip so many wings 
 'Cause all they really wanna do is win 
 And they don't want anyone against 
 They try to dismiss our right to resist 
 Or to fight with the fist you gotta be joking 
 Writing a diss, or reciting a myth, or lighting a spliff 
 You must be toking or 
 Punch drunk off power abused, used 
 In the only way that it has been 
 Ever since any time that I can tell 
 Maybe its nature we're battling 
 The propaganda; new form of 
 The hunters trap that's left for the prey 
 But these predators will only 
 Get fed from filling our heads 
 With the words that they say 
 More or less, you are more or less 
 If you have more or you can guess the rest 
 The story is an old one 
 In my time on this earth I have told some 
 With a Line syllable rhyme typical 
 Would it be better to mime lyrical 
 I'm just giving you my individual 
 Spin on the things that I've seen in the physical 
 I wanna know 
 How do we, how do we find our way? 
 When they have, so many things to say 
 How do we, how do we find our way? 
 When they have, so many things to say 
 They say so much, so much they say don't they? 
 They say so much, so much they say don't they? 
 They say so much, so much they say don't they? 
 They say so much, so much they say don't they? 
 A word only defines another word 
 So tell me what's in a name? 
 Does the word blood, really tell you 
 What it is that flows in my veins? 
 May sound odd 
 That a poet would try to persuade you 
 The words you relate to 
 Are nothing compared to the nothing that happens when nothing 
 They say do they do 
 I suppose what I mean is this 
 If I really had peace of mind 
 I probably wouldn't speak that much 
 And I probably would not write these rhymes 
 How do we, how do we find our way? 
 When they have, so many things to say 
 How do we, how do we find our way? 
 When they have, so many things to say 
 So many things to say 
 So many things to say 
 So many things to say 
 So many things to say
