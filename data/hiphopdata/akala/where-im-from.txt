Yo, OK, OK, Yeah nice, OK 
 Listen 
 Where I'm from 
 Where I'm from 
 Listen 
 Where I'm from it's not presidents, I'm trying to see the queen 
 Different toilet same shit, they're fiending for the big cream 
 Scheming their dough to the ceiling, till the no longer breathing 
 And they do shit to make us look heathen 
 The reason? 
 Born to a broken home, tears of my mother 
 Only those that know 'cause they've been there through all the hunger 
 Others judge us and snub us 
 They shouldn't 
 Growing up in my house, don't think you could of 
 Mummy hustling, no one ever did us no favours 
 Except the neighbours 
 We used to borrow sugar and some toilet paper 
 Embarrassing when it's my turn to knock 
 But it's cool, what don't kill you only make you stronger 
 Know they say I'm conscious my words are positive 
 It's not that, to me it's just the truth is obvious 
 And rather than talking bollocks about who I'd be clapping 
 I'd rather tell the truth about what actually happened 
 You know 
 Every bodies killing five hundred man in the booth 
 The roads are bad but 
 If as much man was dying in the streets as was dying in the booth 
 They'd be nobody left 
 Stop with dishonesty man 
 All my home-boys locked up, everybody who's lost a family member 
 Keep your head up 
 Ain't' nothing sweet in the streets 
 Listen 
 Here in England now we got bloods and crips 
 I'm ashamed and embarrassed to have to admit 
 Our grandparents got chased 'cause they were black 
 Now we kill each other for colours in the union jack 
 Shit 
 This is not the sates, no American dream 
 Just a British nightmare with a similar theme 
 Same scheme, same fiend, same end to the dream 
 Same church, same hurt, same mother that screams 
 With the only difference being there's no opposites here 
 No Jigga no Simmons, no positives here 
 It is obvious we are not prospering here 
 What's horrible? I don't no if it's possible here 
 Our grandparents came here invited by our majesty 
 Tragically just to be treated like savages 
 No Blacks, No Irish and of course no dogs 
 And if it ain't' cleaning toilets then of course no jobs 
 With all the Teddy boys attacking us and calling us wogs 
 Boys in blue at it too, apparently that's not on? 
 And here we are fifty years later, nothings improved 
 It's like we've gone back a step, like we chasing our roots 
 Here we are fifty years later nothings improved 
 We've gone back a step 
 But we ain't' chasing our roots 
 You know 
 Don't know where you come from 
 You don't no where your going 
 Teach the yout dem man 
 Value of self, Understand? 
 When your watching your TV 
 Learning your history book 
 It's not accurate 
 Teach the yout dem 
 Listen, listen, because... 
 It's just a bunch of lies that we perpetuate ourself 
 Being from the hood is not a definition of self 
 Circumstances don't define you, you define you 
 My baby diamond shines so bright it'l blind you 
 That's why I'm everywhere, fronting where rappers would never dare 
 No bodyguards, trust me my people I'm never scared 
 Not 'cause I think I'm hard, just that iv seen your vision 
 A million thugs in prison would die for my position 
 They get there so frequent for various reasons 
 When we're told we ain't shit we really believe it 
 Whether by another brother, a father, a mother 
 The television, or the teachers, police or the judges 
 It's covering the fear that they already no 
 You can only break a diamond with a piece of the same stone 
 Where strong beyond measure, ask your professor 
 How do you make a diamond? A billion years of pressure 
 And a diamond is found where? At first within the rough 
 So no matter where were at there's a diamond inside of us 
 Forget repping the ends, what the ends do for you? 
 Your worth so much more, If only you Knew, You Know? 
 Hold your head 
 All this ends rah, rah, rah, nonsense 
 That's exactly what it is just nonsense 
 All these rappers on TV talking shit about how much they bust their strap and Yah, Yah, Yah 
 You do not listen to them, their talking nonsense 
 They live in big nice houses 
 They got security, and bodyguards, and people to take care of them 
 It's an illusion, you understand? 
 And all the bitches, and the chains and the neck lasses in the video 
 It's just bollocks man, That's nobody's reality 
 When did the hood become so sweet? 
 That's no hood iv ever been in 
 Understand? The hood I no is miserable 
 The hood I no everybody's trying to get out of 
 So why are all these rappers dying to get back in it? And dying to be rude-boys? 
 When all the rude-boys are dying to be legitimate 
 So, it's just nonsense man, just be honest 
 Just be yourself
