What is this thing I see 
 This silly little thing called me 
 This skin, this hair, this flesh 
 This brain, this pain, this mess 
 What's life? 
 A game that we just play with two plain dice? 
 When the shell dies, does the soul fly? 
 Hellfire, does the flame fry? 
 Is this the audition, brief intermission for something much grander 
 Get a bigger piece of pie, great show in the sky 
 Or is that just propaganda? 
 That they telling me, selling me sold with evidence 
 But intelligence, slowers development 
 We that think that we know we are not reverent 
 But we don't even yet know if we're relevant 
 One more pause, one more breath 
 One more pause, one more breath 
 Is this all that there is 
 If it is, I wish I could give 
 One more pause, one more breath 
 We could never know, if we're ever next 
 Every time I think I know, I stop and ask myself 
 What is this thing I see 
 This silly little thing called we 
 This brain, this pain, this flesh 
 These trains, these planes, what's next? 
 Yes, we're gonna beget technology 
 But the majority, escaping poverty 
 No, I don't think that we can 
 'Cause we still think that we got the plan and 
 By judging a man by just what's in his hands 
 Or his land, or his tan and just 'cause we can 
 Pause, take a breath 
 Realise that none of us know what is next 
 See your code of address or the code of your dress 
 We all still use that same hole for our breath 
 Playing the game but there's never a Ref 
 And you can't take it with you if ever you left 
 One more pause, one more breath 
 One more pause, one more breath 
 Is this all that there is 
 If it is, I wish I could give 
 One more pause, one more breath 
 We could never know, if we're ever next 
 Every time I think I know, I stop and ask myself 
 What is this thing I see 
 Who could ever know, what we're gonna be 
 Are we elevating our meditation 
 Not detonating through self-preservation 
 Generation television's raising 
 Yet we're complaining about how they're behaving 
 Washing our hands or just bathing with Satan 
 Yet with all that said, that's just what you make it 
 Pause, take what is naturally given 
 Because actually there is no tax on our living 
 It's a fact though it's naturally hidden 
 Like I'm just an actual assassin on riddim 
 The adrenaline, we're rememberin' 
 Our December is cold as it's ever been 
 Fighting our best, but the victory we revel in 
 Fighting our brethren, how could we ever win? 
 One more pause, one more breath 
 One more pause, one more breath 
 Is this all that there is 
 If it is, I wish I could give 
 One more pause, one more breath 
 We could never know, if we're ever next 
 Every time I think I know, I stop and ask myself
