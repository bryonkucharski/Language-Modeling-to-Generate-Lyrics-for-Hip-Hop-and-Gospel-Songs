Nigger listen, when I spit on the rhythm, I kill em, 
 Raw like the Ball of Brazilians, 
 You don't want war, cor the kids brilliant, 
 Blood, I'm the heir to the throne, 
 Not William, Akala, smart as King Arthur, 
 Darker, harder, faster, 
 Rasclaat, I kick the illest shit, 
 It's like Shakespeare, with a nigger twist, 
 Lyricist, I'm the best on the road, 
 Nitro flow, oh-so-cold, I'ma blow yo, 
 Keep the hoes, I only want dough homes, 
 Nobody close, I'm alone in my own zone, 
 No no love for the po-po, 
 Loco when I rock mics solo, 
 I hope that you know, where you don't go though, 
 Want it with Bolo? Must be coco, 
 It's William back from the dead, 
 But I rap bout gats and I'm black instead, 
 It's Shakespeare, reincarnated, 
 Except I spit flows and strip hoes naked, 
 No fakin', test my blood bruv, 
 It's William, back as a tug 'cause, 
 So real the shit I kick now, 
 Plus I don't write, I recite my shit now, (correct) 
 Straight from the top, expert timin' 
 On top of that now, the whole things rhymin' 
 No more tights, now jeans saggin' 
 If I say so myself, I'm much more handsome, 
 Don't ever compare me to rappers, 
 I'm so quick witted that I split 'em like fractions, 
 My shit, I tell 'em like this 
 It's like Shakespeare with a nigger twist 
 I get you pumped up, 
 Feelin' like you drunk drunk, 
 When my beats bump bump, 
 Lyrics hit like skunk blunts blood, now 
 All the shit I kick, so crazy, 
 There ain't no ifs or maybes, 
 Spit poetry so shady, 
 For lords on road and my hood ladies, 
 Pumped up, feelin' like you drunk drunk, 
 When my beats bump bump, 
 Lyrics hit like skunk blunts blood, now 
 All the shit I kick, so crazy, 
 There ain't no ifs or maybe's, 
 Spit poetry so shady, 
 For lords on road and my hood ladies. 
 I'm similar to William, but a little different, 
 I do it for kids that's illiterate, not Elizabeth, 
 Stuck on the road, faces screwed up, 
 Feel like the world spat 'em out, and they 
 Chewed up, 
 It's a matrix, I try and explain it, 
 On the real though, still ready blaze em, 
 No contradiction just face it, 
 They so enslaved, they are worse than a agent, 
 I grace stages, sharp as razors, 
 Don't get cut 'cause, keep ya distance, 
 No artillery, tryin' be militant, 
 Y'all dudes killin' me, think that ya killin' it, 
 It's embarrassing watchin you babblin', 
 Keep spittin' ya darts, mine is javelins, 
 The hood Tiger Woods too million, 
 Number 1 for so long, its just getting' silly, 
 Shit kinda like Bruce with da knuckles, 
 Like the first time ya ever saw Ali shuffle, 
 You don't want trouble, left layin' in a puddle, 
 Bruv, you are having a bubble, 
 I'm a whole different kettle of fish, 
 Thou shall not fuck with dis, 
 My shit, I tell 'em like this 
 It's like Shakespeare with a nigger twist. 
 To be fair, no MC close to the man, 
 Little just come youths jumpin' out of they pram, 
 Everybody badman, behind a mic stand, 
 It's not creative, one bag of hype, and 
 If you buss a ting, where's the mash? 
 Move so much food? Where's the cats? 
 These dudes ain't real, they just rap, 
 I don't spit what I don't know, 
 Just the facts, 
 No talks of rocks I ain't sold, 
 Shots I ain't blown, so cold and I own my own, 
 My business ridiculous, 
 Sick with it, quick witted, 
 Companies head to head an' liquidate it, 
 Welcome to illa state, meet ya fate mate, 
 Talk truth but we don't play games, 
 Move sick, look sample techno, 
 Never pull a ting, if it ain't gonna let go, 
 That's that, rap track, 
 Clap ya like a black gat, 
 Back chat, crack back, 
 I'm the nigger, that's that, (Beat) 
 The rest of these kids is irrelevant, 
 Don't compare me to him, 
 That's just bigoted, 
 I'm on my own shit, 
 Dicks ain't spit, 
 It's no democracy; dictatorship, 
 So dicks hate my shit, 
 I'm sick, raise ya spliff, 
 I'm swift, blaze 'em quick, 
 My hits, major shit, 
 I flip phrases quick, 
 My sick razor shit, 
 Give thick grazes quick, 
 And chicks say he's crisp, 
 It's not a rumour; 
 That kid Akala, 
 It's not "Ack-a-la", beg ya pardon, 
 Don't get it twisted, 
 Your on the sideline like a mistress, 
 I'm the whizzkid, with the sick shit, 
 My shit, I tell 'em like this, 
 It's like Shakespeare, with a nigger twist.
