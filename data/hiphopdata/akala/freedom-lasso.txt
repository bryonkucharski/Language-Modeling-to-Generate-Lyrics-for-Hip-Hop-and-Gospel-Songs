A rope tightens breath constricted 
 No hand pulls this is self-inflicted 
 Sickness self diagnosed without witness 
 Wish list grip fist the beggary of riches 
 A belly full fights never willingly 
 An empty stomach does not have the energy to finish it 
 Layers in between padded by a dream 
 Stretching for the means 
 Without thought of exhausting the seams 
 No space for indignity on the face of simplicity 
 A taste of sufficiency's a belly full of lethargy 
 A dash of apathy a pinch of ecstasy's a recipe 
 Serving up a feast for the beast of our treachery 
 Not sure if your getting me celebrity's are effigy 
 I hear just fine but I'm deaf to those next to me 
 Conflict it perplexes me 
 Cause out biggest battle 
 Is now we're so free that we choose to be shackled 
 I'm stuck freedom lasso 
 This invisible strain of the human stain 
 Colors every brain, vein 
 Thus chained to another's pain 
 We may not be the artist by we surely are the frame 
 We may just be the smoke but we cannot blame the flame 
 Strange is the fruit that nourishes not the vein 
 Yet we are odder still for we seek it like the rain 
 Nothing bounds out path yet we march perfect in lane 
 Whoever saw a tiger that desired to be tamed? 
 Reality defies nature does not know surprise 
 Yet the lesion of our season blinds even the eagle's eyes 
 Spies dread not headlock tight as thread knot 
 Get lost why throw a bone to a dead dog? 
 This is not charity that is just sarcasm 
 That's why we bite so hard and never bark at em 
 Spark at em's insane 
 It's play gather and prey 
 When even the mighty tiger 
 He desires to be tamed 
 I'm stuck freedom lasso 
 They act as if it's positive 
 Though it's so obviously derogative 
 And even if you're bobby 
 This is never your prerogative 
 It's obvious we're warriors 
 And crooked just like bobby is 
 But colleges and mockeries 
 Will never make a Socrates 
 Apologies and robberies 
 They follow with atrocity 
 Sorrow and hypocrisy 
 Don't make very good crockery 
 Watchin' this it's horror bliss 
 And one day I will promise this 
 The day the tiger wakes 
 That is the day of your apocalypse
