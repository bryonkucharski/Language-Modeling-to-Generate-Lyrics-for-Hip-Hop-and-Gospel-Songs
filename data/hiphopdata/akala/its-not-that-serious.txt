I know we only live our life based on what they think 
 'Cause we think it matters but I reckon 
 If we didn't care for just one second 
 We'd be much happier 
 Realize your life is your's to live 
 Tell your friends or your parents and what they think 
 You want the whole thing 
 Four kids and a good job a big house and quiet down 
 And that's cool, stay in school. Go to uni with those like you 
 If on the other hand you want to travel the world just to meditate 
 That's what you should do 
 You don't need permission from the state line commission 
 Just to be who you are 
 Follow your heart, follow your dreams like a kid again 
 They want to write you off 
 With the end of the bitter pen, let them have it 
 They'll come around eventually 
 If not it wasn't meant to be 
 It's their problem 
 June or December, there's one small thing that I think we should remember 
 It's not that serious 
 Sometimes I want to fight 
 Sometimes I want to cry 
 But then I must remind myself 
 It's not that serious 
 We're gonna make it through 
 And find a better way 
 That works for me and you 
 If you don't conform, society whips you with it's displeasure 
 If they were happy they wouldn't care 
 Whichever way that you chose, what you do with your time 
 Long as you ain't hurtin' no one, then that's fine 
 Problem is we hate to see another live the life that we dream 
 And I don't mean big screen and flashiness 
 Just free, carefree, true happiness 
 Wake everyday excited what's to come 
 Never work a minute when doing something you love 
 So when we judge, ask why, is it because we feel life passed us by 
 It's never too late to get rid of the stress 
 There's a whole world out there 
 Just look up from your desk and say that the world is mine 
 And if you're not having a good time, then you're wasting your time 
 It's not that serious 
 Sometimes I want to fight 
 Sometimes I want to cry 
 But then I must remind myself 
 It's not that serious 
 We're gonna make it through 
 And find a better way 
 That works for me and you 
 You know, yo 
 People think I'm really serious, right 
 And I was for a long time 
 I'm not gonna lie and pretend I wasn't 
 But, then I realize that sometimes you just got enough 
 I mean, I'm not as serious as people think 
 Yeah I like to talk about the issues in the world 
 But at the same time, we can't let them bog us down 
 Yes, the world is not perfect, we all know that 
 It's just not that serious 
 Go to a comedy show, man 
 Take a bubble bath, or, I don't know, buy a pink dressing gown 
 Do something crazy that people wouldn't expect you to do 
 Let's drop these things called egos on the floor 
 Stamp on them, and try to get on with it, and realize that it's just- 
 Just don't take yourself do god damn serious 
 What about the problems in the world? 
 Things ain't golden 
 Yeah, I agree 
 But will worrying solve them? 
 No, I'm not saying ignore 
 By all means do something if you feel for a cause 
 But you can't feel poor enough 
 To enrich one single person on this planet 
 And you can't feel bad enough 
 To fill one single soul with happiness 
 So, the biggest challenge we face, is just keeping a smile on our face 
 If stock markets crash, or girlfriends leave you 
 People don't like what they see when they see you 
 Football teams lose, bands will split 
 But the thing we must remember is this- 
 It's just not that serious 
 It really is not 
 It's not that serious 
 Sometimes I want to fight 
 Sometimes I want to cry 
 But then I must remind myself 
 It's not that serious 
 We're gonna make it through 
 And find a better way 
 That works for me and you 
 Today walk up to somebody and talk to them find out how their day was 
 Don't worry if they think you're crazy- which they probably will 
 And you people in the train- 
 When you don't want no one peering over your shoulder to read your letter 
 Stop taking yourself so god damned seriously 
 It's just your newspaper. 
 If I want to read a bit of your newspaper, what's the problem? 
 You should open it up, and let me have a good look 
 Yeah? Thank you 
 Ladies and gentlemen, this is Akala, not taking himself very seriously 
 And there are probably a lot of people that are angry about that 
 And think I've gone crazy 
 "Why am I not screwing up my face? 
 Why am I not trying to be the best grime MC?" 
 I'm trying to make nice relaxing songs 
 What's my problem? 
 I haven't got a problem 
 It's just that I stopped taking myself so goddamn seriously 
 That's it. Have a good day
