I was the kid in school with hand me downs from my sister 
 And gal dem still loved me now that's charisma 
 Front of my crep split ain't seen a barber for months 
 But the way I profile you would have thought I was Trump 
 Back when I was spotty and my head way outgrew my body 
 Even those times spittin' it shoddy 
 Before I bust my first nut behind the trees in the park 
 You'd find me and Jay drunk way after dark 
 Bams too, looking for moves like bees do swarming 
 Funny thing we all got ball in the morning 
 We like thirteen but grown as we see it 
 You find us any Saturday night in Coliseum 
 Sticking dick to big gal and I told her my age straight 
 Never been one to play games 
 Or watch face or none of that 
 Pop shots I'm gunning back 
 No ball to catch 
 Look how these cowards running back 
 No matter what they say to you 
 No matter what they put you through 
 Always to yourself stay true 
 You gotta hold your head up high 
 When you feel you've hit the ground 
 And they seem to laugh out loud 
 Whatever goes up must come down 
 You gotta hold your head high 
 For my young tugs on every block, eighth in their sock 
 With aims to get paid and parade in the drop 
 Sweet kids get older, grow chips on both shoulders 
 Daddy left it seems the wind done blow colder 
 Even in July, that's why we hoodied the whole year 
 Mothers lose sons when them clouds disappear 
 Nothin' sweet out here, but I count my blessings 
 Been through a lot of shit, but I take it as lessons 
 Just a young yout that ain't never had nothing 
 Many times went to school stomach still rumblin' 
 Still felt like I had a right to fuck 
 Brought gal to my yard and the power would cut 
 While yutes sleeping, I'm at the launderette before school 
 With big bin liners still trying to look cool 
 At the time it was hell, now I just laugh 
 Funny how you change the way you feel about the past 
 No matter what they say to you 
 No matter what they put you through 
 Always to yourself stay true 
 You gotta hold your head up high 
 When you feel you've hit the ground 
 And they seem to laugh out loud 
 Whatever goes up must come down 
 You gotta hold your head high 
 Hold your head up, hold your head up 
 I know you're fed up but you gotta get up 
 Hold your head up, hold your head up 
 Never let up 'cause you've gotta get up 
 Hold your head up, hold your head up 
 I know you're fed up but you gotta get up 
 Hold your head up, hold your head up 
 Never let up 'cause you've gotta get up 
 If they put your back to the wall, you gotta stand tall 
 Don't watch these little dicks, all they do is talk 
 Fuck 'em all I'm rollin', real niggas'll roll wid it 
 Yeah life's a bitch, but I still wanna hit it 
 Spit what's real to me nothing more nothing less 
 Niggas ain't got no homes, but roll with stones around they neck 
 Can't you see you're the diamond, always shining 
 Plus the only thing tough enough to break us is us 
 No matter what they say to you 
 No matter what they put you through 
 Always to yourself stay true 
 You gotta hold your head up high 
 When you feel you've hit the ground 
 And they seem to laugh out loud 
 Whatever goes up must come down 
 You gotta hold your head high
