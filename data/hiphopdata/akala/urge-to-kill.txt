Do you ever just have the urge to kill? 
 Do you ever just have the urge to kill? 
 Do you ever just have the urge to kill? 
 Do you ever just have the urge to kill? 
 Riddle me this, riddle me that 
 If murder runs the globe and this we know and accept 
 What do we expect but mass murders to live happily 
 Those who really fight for freedom to face tragedy 
 When you really look at the world do you feel a sickness 
 Couple dead kids in the world, its just business 
 Arm sales economy, added to the GDP 
 Maybe its just me, maybe I'm naive 
 Though I'm not Siamese, I do feel your pain 
 And I do believe, though maybe I'm insane 
 The state murder is still murder its still murder 
 There's no fight that's big enough to conceal murder 
 Lets make a movie and celebrate our real murder 
 Pay a rapper to glorify, nigga, kill, murder 
 But never question your oppressors or suggest murder 
 Should be directed in your betters that invest murder 
 I wonder is it absurd that we protest murder 
 'Cause clearly they haven't heard that we detest murder 
 However much we detest, we cannot deny 
 That murder has both helped and harmed you and I 
 And anybody, everybody has a human right 
 To defend themselves from oppressors with a greater might 
 I look around this world, such a bloody sight 
 I wanna know 
 Do you ever just have the urge to kill? 
 When you realize that peace can't work 'cause they don't respect peace 
 Oh the feeling is so real! 
 When you see that murder's legal when it's done by police, the beast 
 Do you ever just have the urge to kill? 
 When you see a child's body like a dog in the streets believe 
 Oh the feeling is so real! 
 When there is no justice and we can't breath 
 Do you ever just have the urge to kill? 
 Terrorism is its own religion practiced by millions 
 Obviously not just Muslim but also Jewish and Christian 
 Atheist, Hindu, Buddhist 
 Since when has belief 
 Ever stopped human beings 
 From being bullies 
 They pretend one terror is worse terror 
 Even while they sponsor their terror it works better 
 Even while they bomb their countries and burn them up 
 Even while they colonize them with no letter 
 And we, what do we do? Pay tax to them 
 Maybe I'm a coward 
 No war was ever one by dickheads with a mic shoutin' 
 Rappers can't bring you liberation 
 Just articulating do you share these frustrations that I am facing? 
 Are you one of these assholes like me 
 That believes there's a better world that we could be? 
 But knows that It won't come so easily 
 And revolutionary love there needs to be 
 Everyone has the right to defend the one they love 
 And no uniform gives you the right to shed my blood 
 If the courts systematically denies what we're legally due 
 What should we do? (tell me) 
 Should we pray to heaven and wait for better and hope that it comes true? 
 Or, defend ourselves from you 
 'Cause it's only when you aim your violence at your oppressors that it's taboo 
 I wanna know 
 Do you ever just have the urge to kill? 
 When you realize that peace can't work 'cause they don't respect peace 
 Oh the feeling is so real! 
 When you see that murder's legal when it's done by police, the beast 
 Do you ever just have the urge to kill? 
 When you see a child's body like a dog in the streets believe 
 Oh the feeling is so real! 
 When there is no justice and we can't breath 
 Do you ever just have the urge to kill? 
 Nations and nuclear bombs and colonizers 
 Applaud us for our silence reward us for non violence 
 While supporting old tyrants 
 Calling them all clients 
 They bought them with a fortune a slice of the empire 
 Of course they haven't taught them torture is a science 
 To which you should resort to kill frauds and defiers 
 Feel the force of the fires 
 Petrol poured on the tires 
 Bet it more than retires 
 Whoever's caught in the wires 
 Several daughters in silence 
 Whichever mothers are crying 
 Justice is just like anything 
 If you can't afford to buy it than you starve 
 This is our world that I'm describing 
 It's too much! 
 Do you ever just have the urge to kill? 
 When you realize that peace can't work 'cause they don't respect peace 
 Oh the feeling is so real! 
 When you see that murder's legal when it's done by police, the beast 
 Do you ever just have the urge to kill? 
 When you see a child's body like a dog in the streets believe 
 Oh the feeling is so real! 
 When there is no justice and we can't breath 
 Do you ever just have the urge to kill?
