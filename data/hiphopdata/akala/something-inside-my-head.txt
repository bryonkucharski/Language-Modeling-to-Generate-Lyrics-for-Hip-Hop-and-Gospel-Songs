They wonder why the caged bird sings 
 But even worse a pain 
 Is the bird with lead wings 
 It's like I'm on my own town 
 But can't speak the language 
 Crowded to the point of suffocation 
 Still feel stranded 
 What bandage could heal scars invisible 
 Existing is easy it's living that is difficult 
 It's like a ritual 
 I get close to believing 
 Then I put a fortress up to close in my feelings 
 Dreaming, so close to achieving 
 Then I throw it all away 
 'Cause I'm scared to receive it 
 Living every day in my shadow 
 I find my resolve 
 When the cold night swallows that shadow 
 I travel through the landscape 
 Searching for why 
 But the question follows everywhere I go 
 Like the sky 
 You don't understand my soul 
 Well neither do I 
 It's just something inside my head 
 Won't set me free 
 Won't let me be 
 It's just something inside my head 
 Comin' in between you and me 
 It's just something inside my head 
 I wasn't born this way 
 My condition was learned 
 Once bitten twice shy I don't wanna be burned 
 When you travel a passage 
 That leaves your soul ravaged 
 Your mind waxes placid to limit the damage 
 Your reaction is passive 
 Whether you like it or not 
 You cannot win whether you fight it or not 
 Your brain swallows the pain and buries it instead 
 Now... 
 It's just something that guides my 
 Something that drives my 
 Something inside my head 
 I offend myself then avenge myself 
 And pretend it helps to defend myself 
 I believe myself then deceive myself 
 To retrieve myself I don't need my help 
 Whether the brave myself or slave myself 
 It's strange every day I'm not the same myself 
 I love myself then I hate myself
