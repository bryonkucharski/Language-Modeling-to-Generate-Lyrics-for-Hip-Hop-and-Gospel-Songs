When I feel like "fuck it I've had enough" 
 Might as well bury my head in the sand and run from the world 
 No music or politics, I'm done with all of it, I just can't take no more 
 It's easy to let the world get you down 
 Look around 
 It seems that every towns (?) 
 The haves, the have nots 
 Lives we admire 
 Rags to rags lot that never climb higher 
 We're on a ladder of life, the ladder of success 
 The ladder of fucking over other people the best 
 It's a game of chess, where the pawns get sacrificed 
 They got limited movement and their on the frontline 
 Yeah, the game's rigged from the start 
 This we know in our heart 
 Yet we pick up the dice and play a part 
 But would it be better to act like a spoilt little brat? 
 Kick over the whole game with no shame 
 "I ain't playin' if I can't win" 
 Prayin' if I can't sin 
 What is a wife saying to a daft king? 
 Not much, power's fucked 
 I know it runs the world, sometimes it's too much 
 Like "fuck it I've had enough" 
 Might as well bury my head in the sand and run from the world 
 No music or politics, I'm done with all of it, I just can't take no more 
 When I feel like "fuck it I've had enough" x3 
 In the end I'm like "Shut up you coward, just suck it all up" 
 Can't sleep, my mind's runnin' 
 On a path of it's own and I ain't sure that I'm even comin' 
 All night I been tryna get a wink 
 The sun comes up now and I ain't had a blink 
 I think too bloody much 
 All the voices go around in my mind and I can't shut 'em up 
 They say "ignorance is bliss" 
 I ain't sayin' it is 
 On those nights when I can't shut off, I get pissed 
 For me, this is most nights of the week 
 If we look at the world then how could we sleep? 
 See in my deeper moments 
 I can only keep the (?) on what is wrong with the world and we can't even solve it 
 Like we ain't involved with anything promoted than to focus on our own little selves 
 The rest can go to hell 
 How do I know it so well? It's me 
 Specially at those times I wanna flee from reality 
 Like "fuck it I've had enough" 
 Might as well bury my head in the sand and run from the world 
 No music or politics, I'm done with all of it, I just can't take no more 
 When I feel like "fuck it I've had enough" x3 
 In the end I'm like "Shut up you coward, just suck it all up" 
 The road to depression I'm guessin' is oiled by a choked expression 
 And of course naked oppression 
 The lessons we're supposed to learn, is not possible 
 Cause you are not a fool and the teacher's horrible 
 So what choice left is there for sensitive souls? 
 Fight the power or let it swallow us whole? 
 It is easily done, look what we've become 
 If we could, I'm sure we'd find a way to put out the sun 
 Sometimes when I feel like collapsin' 
 Or giving in to the times that I'm trapped in 
 I contemplate all the others overcoming their fears 
 Fighting battles far harder so that I could be here 
 Then I feel like the silly little boy that I am 
 Count my blessings in the moment and get back to the plan 
 Inspiration is the strangest thing 
 How it travels one spirit to another, transforms how we think 
 I know spirit is a dirty word, in this world obsessed with what we have and what do we earn 
 But it's the only way to explain the voices inside of you 
 Only satisfied when you are inspired to 
 It's the reason when we feel we've had enough, always in the end we manage to get back up 
 Like "fuck it I've had enough" 
 Might as well bury my head in the sand and run from the world 
 No music or politics, I'm done with all of it, I just can't take no more 
 When I feel like "fuck it I've had enough" x3 
 In the end I'm like "Shut up you coward, just suck it all up" 
 Life is hard, life is beautiful 
 Life is strange, and life is unusual 
 If life's a stage, then who wrote the musical? (Who wrote the musical?)
