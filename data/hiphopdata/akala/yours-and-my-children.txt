Right here, dangerous idea 
 If we did this, then we couldn't feel fear 
 If there's no fear, there's no control 
 If there's no control, someone's gotta let go 
 They say I shouldn't say too much they might delete me 
 Realize I don't really care about TV 
 Keep your awards, your applause I'm easy 
 All I can do in this life is just be me 
 Pilger can say it, so can Naomi Klein 
 Its free speech for them, that's fine 
 Young black rappers should utter the same words 
 Utterly absurd, nutter, insane, nerd 
 Even the fact I call myself black 
 Social conditioning and that's a fact 
 The idea of races has no factual basis 
 It was made just to serve racists 
 To justify to doing to some what couldn't be done 
 To others, but they all are our sons 
 Black or white all of our sons 
 Muslim, Christian all of our sons 
 Look up in the sky that's all of our Sun 
 Last time I checked we only had one 
 So if some were superior, others inferior, based on exterior 
 Well then surely the sun would know and fall in to line? 
 It would rain on your crops and not mine? 
 Air would prefer to inhabit your lungs? 
 Food would prefer the taste of your tongue? 
 If that's not the case then nature has declared 
 Despite what we say the worlds in fact fair? 
 Kids in Iraq 
 Yours and my children 
 Kids in Iran 
 Yours and my children 
 Afghanistan 
 Yours and my children 
 Even Sudan 
 Yours and my children 
 Kids in Brazil 
 Yours and my children 
 Police drive by the favela and just kill them

 Problem is, it feels better to feel better 
 And reap without sowing 
 Whatever is growing 
 Never ever slowing, turn days to dark nights 
 Their backs still bent from the weight of our life 
 Look what I spent and gents it's half price 
 'Cause he is bent over the sewing machine half his life 
 Don't matter that we don't pull it 
 If we don't care that's our breads buttered with the bullets 
 Our cars choke on blood 
 Limbs in our diamond tip rings go rotten 
 There's something we forgotten 
 Pillars of the temple may seem separate 
 But they support one roof 
 If your really checking it 
 All of our slaughters 
 Only our daughters 
 Only our self in a war that we fought with 
 All corrupt laws it's, we are the causes 
 'Cause we can't see they're all of our daughters 
 Kill a couple of us you're a devil 
 If you kill a couple million of them 
 Get stripes and medals 
 Generals conduct the great death symphony 
 Played in the key of hate 
 By musicians with no rhythm but offbeat killing 
 Hear the harmonies the screams of young women 
 They're not important 
 They are just orphans 
 How can that be if they're all of our daughters? 
 They're not important 
 They are just orphans 
 How can that be if they're all of our daughters

 If we decided to not be divided 
 Saw no one that we could side with 
 All the gun and stupid violence 
 All the fun of stupid tyrants 
 The blood of our defiance of the laws of natural science 
 Would have subsided or died a death or had no hiding left 
 Instead it provided the horse to ride on to the ride of death 
 We're enlightened but we don't know right from left 
 'Cause we're so frightened 
 It's like we're blinded to the sight of death 
 For all our writing only writing on the doors of death 
 We're only fighting for the right to resort to theft 
 We would steal the air if we could as if we're short of breathe 
 Only if we're sure that it would have the cause and effect 
 If some part of us good, tell me where it is kept 
 'Cause we are saying nothing while we crush them like a fucking pest 
 If you discuss it, everybody is turning fucking deaf 
 Look down at your kids, what if they were next?
