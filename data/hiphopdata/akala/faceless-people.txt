The faceless people 
 The faceless people 
 The faceless people 
 The faceless people 
 We are the faceless people you don't ever see 
 We are the faceless people you don't wanna be 
 We are the faceless people you don't ever see 
 We are the faceless people, people 
 As the world turns, so does my head 
 I need a little leg just to butter my bread 
 Gets a little bitter but I've gotta get fed 
 Never been a quitter so I've gotta get ahead 
 I am the invisible man, you can't be me 
 I am the invisible man, you can't see me 
 I am the invisible man but I'm 3D 
 Come and meet me, Mr. Invisible 
 We are the faceless 
 We are the faithfuless 
 Here today, tomorrow we're gone 
 But nothing is wrong 
 It's the same song, we're invisible 
 Nothing can change us 
 Or rearrange us 
 We come and we go but nobody knows 
 And nobody shows 
 We ain't nobody, we're invisible 
 We are the faceless people, people 
 We are the faceless people, people 
 We are the faceless people you don't ever see 
 We are the faceless people you don't wanna be 
 We are the faceless people you don't ever see 
 We are the faceless people you don't wanna be 
 As the world turns, so does my head 
 I need a little leg just to butter my bread 
 It's a little bitter but I've gotta get fed 
 And I've never been a quitter so I've gotta get ahead 
 I'm your worst teacher 
 Your favorite student 
 Frivolous spender, your saving is foolish 
 Lads on a bender, come on let's do this 
 I'm the pretender but I speak trueness 
 We are the faceless 
 We are the faithfuless 
 Here today, tomorrow we're gone 
 But nothing is wrong 
 It's the same song, we're invisible 
 Nothing can change us 
 Or rearrange us 
 We come and we go but nobody knows 
 And nobody shows 
 We ain't nobody, we're invisible 
 We are the faceless people, people 
 We are the faceless people, people 
 Can't you see what is happening to us here 
 We are tearing apart tryna keep it near 
 Can't you see what's happening to us here, my dear... 
 I don't wanna wake up feeling like a wasteaway 
 I'm gonna save it for another rainy day 
 I wanna raise these stakes in the game I play 
 But I can feel it all slipping out my way 
 Because I am the invisible man, you can't see me 
 Being the invisible man is not easy 
 I am the invisible man but I'm 3D 
 Can't beat me, Mr. Invisible 
 We are the faceless 
 We are the faithfuless 
 Here today, tomorrow we're gone 
 But nothing is wrong 
 It's the same song, we're invisible 
 Nothing can change us 
 Or rearrange us 
 We come and we go but nobody knows 
 And nobody shows 
 We ain't nobody, we're invisible 
 We are the faceless people, people 
 We are the faceless people, people
