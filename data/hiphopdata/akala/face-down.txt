Lay down, face in the dirt 
 From the waist down, chasin' the skirt 
 Since the playground, sucka for a flirt 
 Now ya lay down, face down. 
 Lay down, face in the dirt 
 From the waist down, chasin' the skirt 
 Since the playground, sucka for a flirt 
 Now ya lay down, face down 
 It amazes me, all the things that we'll do to get it 
 Talk about it a little, next thing forget it 
 It'll rule your whole life if you let it 
 I don't believe that it's only every 6 seconds 
 Constant drones for those with testosterone 
 You know that a dog's gotta chase his bone 
 Wherever it's thrown, however far from home 
 You need to lay down, face down 
 Once blood starts flowin', and hair starts growin' 
 And curves start showin', and we get our toe in 
 Jump in with both feet, so deep we nearly drown 
 Got nothing to say unless it's around 
 Chasin' it, gettin' it, tastin' it, excellent 
 Look how I'm flexin' it 
 Every endeavor becomes just another clever way to lay down, face down. 
 Lay down, face in the dirt 
 From the waist down, chasin' the skirt 
 Since the playground, sucka for a flirt 
 Now ya lay down, face down. 
 Lay down, face in the dirt 
 From the waist down, chasin' the skirt 
 Since the playground, sucka for a flirt 
 Now ya lay down, face down 
 I'm not sure if women know the things men do 
 Maybe you do and you're just the same too 
 But it's the only reason we go to the gym 
 Get a trim, and try to better him 
 It's why we study, just to get money 
 So when we step to you, you won't look at us funny 
 Even the stealin' and drug dealers 
 The pressure to just look appealin' 
 So you can look our way and we can get the feelin' 
 And what do you think is the motivation? 
 Why a man will take another man's nation? 
 Same struggle, just on a bigger level 
 For us fellas, this is our peacock feathers 
 And I'm not saying that women are to blame 
 I'm just sayin' if you didn't give us any less to change 
 We'd change very quickly 
 Believe what I'm sayin', maybe you're the same 
 It's always on the brain. 
 Lay down, face in the dirt 
 From the waist down, chasin' the skirt 
 Since the playground, sucka for a flirt 
 Now ya lay down, face down. 
 Lay down, face in the dirt 
 From the waist down, chasin' the skirt 
 Since the playground, sucka for a flirt 
 Now ya lay down, face down 
 And don't get me wrong, I ain't knockin' a bit of fun 
 I'm just sayin' when you've got a million sons 
 All over the gaffe and you don't see one 
 You have to ask yourself, is it really fun? 
 How many homes you broke 
 Because the little head was stronger than the bigger head? 
 Ain't enough we gotta get a bigger bed? 
 And I ain't sayin' I'm better, fellas I'm never 
 I'm sayin' imagine we use that energy instead of just- 
 Lay down, face in the dirt 
 From the waist down, chasin' the skirt 
 Since the playground, sucka for a flirt 
 Now ya lay down, face down. 
 Lay down, face in the dirt 
 From the waist down, chasin' the skirt 
 Since the playground, sucka for a flirt 
 Now ya lay down, face down 
 All of the things that we will do 
 Is all we try to get with you 
 And all the nonsense that we say 
 In the hope that you will look our way 
 All day every day, it's on our mind 
 And when we stray we pay the price 
 But we take a chance and roll the dice 
 And we just end up 
 Lay down, face in the dirt 
 From the waist down, chasin' the skirt 
 Since the playground, sucka for a flirt 
 Now ya lay down, face down. 
 Lay down, face in the dirt 
 From the waist down, chasin' the skirt 
 Since the playground, sucka for a flirt 
 Now ya lay down, face down
