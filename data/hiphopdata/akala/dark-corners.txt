Thanks to the revolutionary, great victim 
 Find them accident 
 Drug addicted politician 
 Whatever I was self, a wordy a definition 
 We can't escape the charrier, a transition 
 Some characterize it as the judgement of the sinners 
 Always spiritualizing 
 And they say there is no difference 
 Energy ain't created or destroyed if this changes form 
 Once we play the songs 
 The sound just travels on 
 Dark corners 
 The dark corners are the place 
 Where we look death in the faces 
 And we let it give us chase 
 But it always gets away 
 Dark corners are the place 
 When we running our alarms 
 And we cannot back it up 
 Death always catches up 
 As the needles plunge into the vein 
 My blood was exchange 
 For those underground 
 Afghan something was strange 
 This time the substance, the injected was pure 
 Everything you yapping for been, cut never raw, like all users 
 They use to make the pain disappear 
 And it was the only time my life, my mind felt so clear 
 He had struggling with a sickness ever since 14 
 When he remembered the hand that touched him finally understood what it means 
 Off the evil, on the struggle 
 Finally got clean 
 And met a girl 
 That made it worth pursuing his dreams 
 They had plans to start a family 
 With a wedding in June 
 He didn't know he was so conventional 
 But ye it was true 
 So when the news came about Michelle, he just lost it 
 Ran straight back to the same block where he use to cop it 
 His old connect came up in the road, new supplier 
 Brave much higher 
 When he hit straight fire 
 His whole body went into shock 
 And fell asleep 
 His brains forget to tell the lungs that they needed to breathe 
 Dark corners 
 Now he's in the dark corners 
 When we hit them dark corners 
 Can't see 
 But dark corners 
 A good girl, a normal girl that was everybody's view 
 And though this annoyed her 
 She couldn't denied it, it was true 
 Whatever convention it was 
 She was in it 
 Grow up with both parents 
 Nice house in the states 
 Though, the ain't never be rich 
 That something they did prosper 
 Parents from Nigeria 
 Both of them doctors 
 Church every Sunday 
 She ain't never missed a week 
 Everest school she was top of the class 
 Yet they demanded better 
 Went straight to Cambridge 
 Studying law 
 But had strange dreams of justice and helping the poor 
 Maybe that's part of why she chose him 
 Didn't know what in her mind 
 But he was clever 
 I'm a kind of nigga who is troubled inside 
 Her parents wanted for her a nice young looking boy 
 So when they found that he was English 
 They were slightly annoyed 
 But when they found out he was addicted to drugs 
 It was two people 
 Say they wouldn't come to the wedding 
 It was totally shameful 
 Michelle left the house in the storm 
 It was a rainy night 
 She never saw the truck before it ended her life 
 Her parents had decided that they would apologise 
 But they never got the chance in the end 
 We live on borrowed time 
 When dark corners come 
 No, cannot run 
 No longer shall your skin bathe in the sun, that's right 
 When them dark corners come 
 No, cannot run 
 No longer shall your skin bathe in the sun, that's right 
 Dark corners 
 Dark corners 
 The dark corners are the place 
 Where we look death in the faces 
 And we let it give us chase 
 But it always gets away 
 Dark corners are the place 
 When we running our alarms 
 And we cannot back it up 
 Death always catches up 
 Dark corners 
 The dark corners are the place 
 Where we look death in the faces 
 And we let it give us chase 
 But it always gets away 
 Dark corners are the place 
 When we running our alarms 
 And we cannot back it up 
 Death always catches up 
 Calling all money ye 
 Going to wealth 
 But how well did he play with the cards that were dealt 
 In his life with himself 
 Triple the family coffins 
 Even his father was slightly jealous 
 Of what he accomplished 
 Became an icon 
 Products that can't resembles his age 
 Each time it was released 
 Should have seen him with a craze 
 The was an innovator 
 The great creator 
 But beneath all the shine and the sheen 
 Was a slave labour 
 And of course, there was that was that we're fighting 
 To keep, the man that was throwing from the a capella public 
 When they throw back those release 
 All that come back is scrutiny 
 The scientist to offer the report disappeared 
 Message is clear, as power is old 
 It's blood 
 Now wish to show you 
 In which powerful grows 
 Power changes reality 
 And this CEO 
 Had a off leverage with the media only painted him as gold 
 But despite all the wealth and the things that he owned 
 On his deathbed 
 He couldn't find comfort for his soul 
 All he could see is images of death reaching him 
 Victims of mercenaries that this government betrayed 
 Fighted the cold sweat 
 Colours changed 
 Billions couldn't find him another day, another pain 
 Dark corners 
 Dark corners 
 The dark corners are the place 
 Where we look death in the faces 
 And we let it give us chase 
 But it always gets away 
 Dark corners are the place 
 When we running our alarms 
 And we cannot back it up 
 Death always catches up
