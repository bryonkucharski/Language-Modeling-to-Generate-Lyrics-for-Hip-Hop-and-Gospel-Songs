You what? 
 You what? 
 I don't like to lose my temper but they give you no choice 
 It's like they were born irritating, even the sound of their voice 
 Is dedicated to testing the patience of the most saintly type, elevated 
 So when they are faced with us that are basic 
 Are we supposed to be able to take it? I can't, can you? 
 No? Well then, here's what you tell them: Don't piss me off! 
 It's the tone of a pompous git when he's on your shit 
 And he just make you wanna spit 
 But instead you bite your top like and feel like a dickhead 
 'Cause this ain't the time of place for a punch in the face 
 But you just wanna humble a mug 
 Move peaceful with abundance of love 
 But you're not a prick and he muddled you up 
 Taking him out with a straight to the mouth 
 Sometimes that's all they understand 
 Taking him out and then straighten him out 
 So he realises he won't ever shout in the face of a grown ass man again 
 Are you a little boy and you're only 10? 
 Like if you need to you won't defend? 
 Must've confused you with him and his friend 
 But when you blow your gasket shit gets drastic 
 You're not elastic snap like a matchstick and you will slap pricks, yeah 
 Hype as an Irish man on St. Patrick's 
 Don't piss me off 
 Don't piss me off 
 Don't piss me off 
 You what, you what 
 Don't piss me off 
 Don't piss me off 
 Don't piss me off 
 Don't piss me off 
 You what, you what, you what, you what 
 Don't piss me off 
 I don't like to lose my temper and it don't happen that often 
 Sometime somebody wanna be a problem 
 And nothing else will stop them 
 Other than knowing that physical conflict ain't off the roster 
 Box an imposter 
 This ain't life or death, this ain't my family under a threat 
 It's just a day when a little mug gets 
 Out of his pram 'cause he don't recollect 
 How it could get when the left hook checks 
 That same mouth that spouted the mess 
 You ain't on road, you don't need to body no-one 
 Unless they trouble your mum 
 Fuck doing life, over little backchat 
 That's what the elbow's for to attack that 
 I ain't gonna lie, when I was a younger 
 Shit, something in an Avirex in the summer 
 I got lucky lotta man doing bird, wanking no access to a bird 
 Over he said she said, what have you heard? 
 My ends, your ends, shit is absurd 
 So here's to an old school punch up, come and have a dust up 
 We should be teaching the youngers 
 You ain't on road, you don't need to body no-one 
 Ynless they trouble your mum 
 We are not dumb, we know how fools are become 
 Everyone on a knife and a gun 
 But we all seen too many man doing life, 50 in a cell 
 Over the hype so let's get old school 
 Let's just fight, put up your fists and tell 'em like this! 
 Don't piss me off 
 Don't piss me off 
 Don't piss me off 
 You what, you what 
 Don't piss me off 
 Don't piss me off 
 Don't piss me off 
 You what, you what, you what, you what 
 Don't piss me off 
 Don't piss me off 
 Don't piss me off 
 Don't piss me off 
 You what, you what 
 Don't piss me off 
 Don't piss me off 
 Don't piss me off 
 You what, you what, you what, you what 
 Don't piss me off
