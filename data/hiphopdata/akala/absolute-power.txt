Absolute power corrupts absolutely 
 But absolute powerlessness does the same 
 It's not the poverty 
 It's the inequality that we live with everyday that will turn us insane

 In a scheme of livin' my life wasn't hard 
 But as far as Britain goes shit I practically starved 
 Sleeping in a track suit, gas meter runnin' out 
 Electric cut off as well, candles lightin' up the house 
 Lookin' in my momma's eyes I see how she feels 
 The strain and the pain of just paying bills 
 It ain't real, and that's how I grew like so many more 
 And it is part of who I am 
 I am very sure 
 You wanna know the rage I feel in my stomach 
 Knowing my mum and dad split up when I was still in her stomach 
 And not everything that happened I will put in sixteens 
 But I will tell you enough so you will know what I mean 
 My boy's mother got cancer the same time as mine 
 His mother died, and mine survived 
 The shit was fucked back then 
 When I was like ten already had the mental strength 
 More than many grown men 
 Absolute power corrupts absolutely 
 But absolute powerlessness does the same 
 It's not the poverty 
 It's the inequality that we live with everyday that will turn us insane 
 This was a couple years after my step-dad left 
 Did he really know the crazy mess that he left? 
 'Cause mum done' recovered from the lumps in her neck 
 Being poor and alone just couldn't cope with the stress 
 And I earn my big sis for 
 So much soul that night 'hattan left school 
 When she left home 
 I was thirteen by now 
 Still a little kid, innocent 
 Next couple years though would turn him 'to a militant 
 That is the result of no food in the fridge 
 And every other day being searched by the pigs 
 Fuck these patronizing teachers 
 Don't want my grades 'slip, trynna' emasculate me 
 -Yeah turn me 'to a bitch 
 And I don't mean a woman please lemme be clear 
 I mean a spineless man 'cause what do they fear 
 Than a working class black male with a brain 
 When our energy is harnessed, every changed 
 Look at 'Pac look at Marley look at Hendrix look at Garvey 
 This is the potential that is wasted on a daily basis 
 In this racist, classist world that we live in 
 Still we comin' from nothing but we educate millions 
 Absolute power corrupts absolutely 
 But absolute powerlessness does the same 
 It's not the poverty 
 It's the inequality that we live with everyday that will turn us insane 
 I understand why it scares you 
 It's like how dare you 
 Overcome obstacles that we have been careful to 
 Place in your way every step of the way 
 In this so called democracy where kids get sprayed 
 Blacks and the Asians, Turks and the chavs 
 Crowded in council flats, living like ants 
 And who's more confused than the poor white trash 
 Spouting the bullshit about they want their country back 
 It never was yours, you should read more 
 What they did to brown people they did to their own poor 
 Peoples memories short, so much that I'm seeing 
 Black and Asian kids cussing eastern Europeans 
 No pot to piss in, makes competition 
 I fail to see how this is an effective system 
 Cats and dogs in America and Britain 
 Eat better food then most of humanity 
 We spend our technology only on killin' 
 How is this more than sophisticated savagery 
 It's like it's said, the world is a stage 
 Each person's just an actor with a part to play 
 Like the middle class kids, - kids of the rich 
 Have everything, but yet still they pissed 
 On coke and ketamine, strung out on heroin 
 I ain't generalizing, look at the evidence 
 Absolute power corrupts absolutely 
 But absolute powerlessness does the same 
 It's not the poverty 
 It's the inequality that we live with everyday that will turn us insane 
 Go to Glastonbury any year 
 You will see, unlike carnival 
 It won't be crawling with police 
 This is London, the kids on the very next street 
 Had a very different life experience than me 
 In my experience they can't help but be smug 
 After a lifetime of what they think's just good luck 
 They're still more anxious 
 And more thankless 
 Unearned privilege weigh's like an anchor 
 That's why they copy what we do, tryna' be what they not 
 They will grow up though and get better jobs 
 They will maintain the system they claim that they hated 
 But they can't burn it down they got a stake in this matrix 
 Hip-hop is just a fad to them, you didn't know? 
 But to us, this our living breathing soul 
 And yeah they might backpack in South America 
 Or even volunteer in an African village 
 But all said and done, push comes to shove 
 And shit hits the fan they're middle class and British 
 That's just how it is, most rich brown people are just as full of shit 
 So more concerned with they cars and jewels 
 Most of the worlds poor looks just like you 
 So more concerned with imprivileged few 
 Most of the worlds poor looks just like you 
 Absolute power corrupts absolutely 
 But absolute powerlessness does the same 
 It's not the poverty 
 It's the inequality that we live with everyday that will turn us insane
