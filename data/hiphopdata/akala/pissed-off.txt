True words are never beautiful 
 Beautiful words are never true 
 Every truly clear thing 
 Need never prove 
 If it is not enough, it will probably never do 
 Ever feel like someone lives your life but it is never you? 
 You? Not knowing if coming, going or flowing 
 Every door that you open 
 A key to another one that's broken 
 Every word that is spoken 
 Somebody else's poem 
 And the more that we focus 
 The less we ever seem to notice 
 It's like the sound of the letterbox early in the morning 
 But you know it's nothing good 
 Just a red letter warning 
 Sucking every penny that we got 
 'Til we ain't got a pot left 
 All this pressure on my back 
 Do we want it off off off? Yes! 
 Do you feel pissed off just like me? 
 Do you feel pissed off just like me? 
 Do you feel pissed off just like me? 
 I got an idea just why that might be 
 We touch it, we taste it, we take a sip 
 We breathe it, we need it, it invades our lips 
 We hold it, we own it, it controls our grip 
 It's something, it's nothing 
 It's just how we live 
 I can't call it 
 It's something with how we live 
 I can't call it 
 It's something with how we live 
 I can't call it 
 It's something with how we live 
 It's something, it's nothing 
 It's just how we live 
 True words are never beautiful 
 Beautiful words are never true 
 What is your view? 
 Blessings or curses, are never ever few? 
 The man with no mind 
 The one who will never choose 
 The skin with no feeling is the one that will never bruise 
 We can't feel it, we touch it, we taste it, we breathe it 
 We peel it, eat it, believe it, we feed it 
 Heed it, we need it, defeat it? 
 Won't even meet it 
 To beat it you have to seek it 
 Cheat it? You just release it 
 Beneath it you get the secret 
 It's not real 
 Guns don't kill, the people behind them do 
 All the ism, schisms, divisions, if you decide it's true 
 They are doing nothing, shit 
 Just what they're designed to do 
 Look close enough at your enemy 
 And you will find it's you 
 Do you feel pissed off just like me? 
 Do you feel pissed off just like me? 
 Do you feel pissed off just like me? 
 I got an idea just why that might be 
 We touch it, we taste it, we take a sip 
 We breathe it, we need it, it invades our lips 
 We hold it, we own it, it controls our grip 
 It's something, it's nothing 
 It's just how we live 
 I can't call it 
 It's something with how we live 
 I can't call it 
 It's something with how we live 
 I can't call it 
 It's something with how we live 
 It's something, it's nothing 
 It's just how we live 
 True Words are never beautiful 
 Beautiful words are never true 
 The liar is the only one in the world that is never true 
 Fly all over the world but never move 
 The only vehicle he have, we never use 
 Talk a lot about dreams but never do 
 Is this just me and you? 
 Stuck in this position 
 Wishing we even had a mission 
 And wouldn't spend 40 years barely chasing a living 
 Job that we hate with a dying soul 
 Boss that we'd like to strangle slow 
 The partner we live with we don't even know 
 Because the man in the mirror is just another freak show 
 Stand like a pillar but what do we hold? 
 Have a lot of things but what do we really own? 
 Absolutely nothing 
 We're just bluffing the entire show 
 All of our discussions 
 And our fussing over the price of Gold 
 Should we be reminded that a Diamond is just crushing coal? 
 And they don't own it 
 It's we that make up the motive 
 They are not giants, just notice 
 They only stand on our shoulders, shit 
 And they don't own 
 It's we that make up the soldiers 
 They are not giants, just notice 
 They only stand on our shoulders 
 Do you feel pissed off just like me? 
 Do you feel pissed off just like me? 
 Do you feel pissed off just like me? 
 I've got an idea why the fuck that might be 
 We feel that we are not in control of our own lives 
 We see that we are not in control of our own lives 
 We taste that we are not in control of our own lives 
 It's clear that we are not in control of our own lives 
 But we are more in control, then we could ever know 
 But we are more in control, then we could ever know 
 But we are more in control, then we could ever know 
 The steering wheel is right there, just grab a hold
