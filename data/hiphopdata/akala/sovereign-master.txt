My artillery's full to the brim 
 With a criminal syllable peel back skin 
 It's a sin, more than a loss or win 
 If you take on him I will break your kin 
 With the words I'm ashame him 
 'Cause with the words I'm a shaman 
 Spiritual mind elevation 
 Back through time on the back of the rhyme 
 Shackles align through back of my spine 
 Capturing rhyme all the facts in the line 
 And the timing is frighting, I'm brighter than lightning 
 Not a man, a character from a movie 
 I chew through metal while my hand breaks Uzis 
 Who's these floozies? 
 Claiming they wanna slew me 
 Do what you you gotta do G 
 I quite like fighting I've made that clear 
 Take your career and replace it with tears 
 The Shakespeare is here I take fear and peer 
 Into the hearts of men and show you they're cowards 
 But I never allow em, I'm sending them flowers 
 Like five man on earth that can rap with this shower 
 Capture, empower, in fact I'm a tower 
 My roots go 10 miles down in the earth 
 How you gonna knock man down? 
 Silly little clown, when you got a dig down first 
 Who wants what with he kid I'm the best 
 I don't mean it in jest like most rappers do 
 Do yourself a favour look back through the albums 
 Mixtapes, and tell me who 
 Has been so consistent with blistering speed 
 Resisting the system not (?) 
 Put things over a person 
 Verbally I'm worser than the most of the worst of em 
 Put a hearse on em, see how it looks 
 Put a verse on em, see if he shook 
 Worse than a crook, see the words that I took from their language 
 I mangle more man that banners starred spangled 
 'Cause I'm a vandal 
 You look dumber than man wearing socks with their sandals 
 Some man still do it tho, no shame 
 Us man still slew it tho, no strain 
 Who said you'll go through with no pain 
 They should have told you it is no gain 
 The A with the A with the A with the A 
 And I stay every day every day every day 
 'Cause I'm harder than Bane was, Fuck Batman! 
 Some prick just defending the system 
 You all know my name 'cause, we attack man 
 Get moved along like blacks out of Brixton 
 Fact not fiction, practice my diction 
 Rip these pricks like zips when you'r zips (?) 
 If I catch you, stiff as a statue 
 Pain is too much for you to react to, so you just freeze 
 I don't really mind, I'm pleased 
 Better than your talk just breeze, jheeze 
 You don't wanna ramp with these 
 Siamese flows 'cause I'm stuck to the beat 
 Chief, you don't really know that's its peak 
 The flows so cold better hold your receipt 
 And take that back back, when you sold crap crap 
 When ya hit back back, akala is back back 
 The world so gully, they could all rap about books 
 Still have the hood go bap bap, fam 
 It ain't that I've seen the strap stuff, I see the bigger picture of where we are trapped at 
 A junction, a function, people are munching on our flesh 
 'Cause were meat for the luncheon 
 So I punch them, ones that come with assumptions 
 That I won't rumble for lunches 
 I'm hungry, I'm starving, bones I am munching 
 Fuck crews I'm taking on countries 
 Why bring your rap to a nuclear war fight? 
 Give it 2 sec, be dead like your hype 
 10 years and I've been round the world twice 
 Why am I lying? like 10 times 
 And I bend rhymes lines, to ascend minds 
 And I'm 10 times guys that your friends hype 
 Yes I'm the best and I'm blessed, so don't test 
 Who ever questing whether knowledge is power, are you fucking deaf?
