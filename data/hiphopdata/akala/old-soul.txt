I don't wanna romanticize another time that's gone by 
 But I have to be honest and tell you that 
 I am an old soul 
 So some Nina Simone is gonna put me in the zone 
 Quicker then some talk of Patron 
 Or Crystal or Pistol it's oh so tedious 
 I want to hear some tunes 
 Like strange fruit with meaning in 
 I want to hear the wolf howling and the waters muddy 
 I want it to dance, want it to make me cry but also funny 
 Feeling that inner city blues, Marvin's the town crier 
 Some Soul II Soul 
 Some Aswad with Dub Fire 
 Some Gregory Isaacs, 
 A little touch of Dennis Brown 
 I love the soul but nothing moves me like that Reggae sound 
 Jamaican blood, sound system upbringing 
 Our black American cousins are big influences 
 On the songs we are singing 
 It's all Soul with Africa at it's base 
 So Fela and Masakela, Makeba play from the same place 
 I remember, I remember 
 Do you remember? 
 I remember 
 I remember, I remember 
 'Cause I'm just an old soul 
 I'm just an old soul 
 I'm just an old soul 
 Do you remember? 
 I'm quite sure the right chords are a cure for disease 
 If music is the food of love, let us feast 
 An open appetizer, whose songs cannot retire 
 The legend Stevie Wonder comes bursting out through the wire 
 The main course, of course, is Hendrix and Marley 
 James Brown will get down and start the after-party 
 After dark is only Pendergrass 
 Grab a partner and do the slow-grind wallpaper dance 
 There is something about the old sound on the analogue 
 And real musicianship that we just can't carry on 
 Or maybe I just am an old soul romanticizing 
 About the good old days when Miles Davis was a commercial artist 
 When singers could sing soul 
 And had a message 
 And if you saw them live they sounded better than the record 
 But how would I know I was not even on the globe 
 When most of these artists rocked 
 Simple, I'm an old soul 
 I remember, I remember 
 Do you remember? 
 I remember 
 I remember, I remember 
 'Cause I'm just an old soul 
 I'm just an old soul 
 I'm just an old soul 
 Do you remember? 
 Old souls, old souls 
 Old souls, old souls 
 And it feels like 
 And it feels like 
 Like I've been here before 
 Are you like me, are you an old soul? 
 Do you only like music from before you were born? 
 When you're listening to records 
 Or contemplating the questions 
 Do you ever get the feeling that you've been here before? 
 Do you find yourself talking about the kids these days 
 Then have to remind yourself about your actual age? 
 If it's only Reggae or Soul since you were five years old 
 A little Blues, a little Jazz 
 You know you're an old soul 
 I remember, I remember 
 Do you remember? 
 I remember 
 I remember, I remember 
 'Cause I'm just an old soul 
 I'm just an old soul 
 I'm just an old soul 
 Do you remember?
