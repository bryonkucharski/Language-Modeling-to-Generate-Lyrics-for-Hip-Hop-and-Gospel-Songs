Truth 
 Who knows it? 
 Definitely not me 
 And they say they do? 
 They ain't said shit 
 Look at their attitudes 
 Who Knows what the truth is 
 'Cause when I'm stupid enough to claim the exclusive 
 Rights on nulling of the facts, bullshit 
 Its just another attack, causing 
 You to be pushed to the back, move it 
 If you accept that you lack, prove it 
 Skill's of your own 
 Are you groaning 
 Your tone 
 In your phone 
 Gonna add your pay to poem? homes? 
 Accept my definition 
 Of yourself then you're in my prison 
 Whos reality's 
 Gradually 
 Having me 
 Casually 
 Can you fathom the insanity 
 Of believing the truth is held by a few 
 And it ain't me or you 
 Ain't no truths just points of view 
 If it ain't known then is it still true 
 And If God made scriptures? 
 Can you tell me? 
 What language did she write in? 
 And if she picked one, out of the thousands? 
 How is that enlightening 
 For those that don't speak the language 
 How they gonna understand it? 
 Or is god that underhanded 
 That he'd act just about as dumb as man is 
 People just wanna feel important 
 Reporting ideas of the truth extorting 
 Those without nothing are the ones that brought in 
 Look at religion its almost deporting 
 Hard to admit that the world we're brought in 
 We ain't got a clue what the fuck the force is 
 That makes uncountable stars in the cosmos 
 Easy like a painter doing odd jobs 
 Accept that we don't know what's what 
 All gonna die anyway so what's lost 
 Good, bad, heaven, hell 
 Just ideas that are sold so well 
 By all the people with power and privilege 
 To trap us in fear, living like invalids 
 C'mon look at the BASTARDS like 
 Telling you to wait for the afterlife 
 They Ain't gotta live with half the strife 
 Fuck turn the other cheek, hardest strike 
 For anyone that tries to take your power 
 And use it in their way selfish 
 Nah, fuck these cowards 
 You're as divine as anybody else is 
 Anyone that tries to trouble your loved ones 
 That is the time and the place that you can buss guns 
 Numb fucks livin' off trust funds 
 Got us down hear struggling for nuff crumbs 
 People end up dumb, killing over lump sums 
 Look how quickly we become accustom 
 To picture the paper that's pretty 
 The price of a tenant to live in the city 
 Life were defending has ever been shitty 
 They write all the endings and never been with me 
 Look what they feed us, leaders 
 Prophets a profit, think that they're Jesus 
 Did Jesus ask for a church collection? 
 Or drive a rolls royce with a turbo engine? 
 Lines in my voice and the words I mention? 
 Inspired by choice that of false pretension? 
 Blinded by noise of the poise of pension 
 Sang with my boys we are music henchmen (?) 
 See? the truth I mention 
 Beyond my own comprehension
