Lose myself in you 
 Find myself in you 
 Sometimes I feel like, I'm not enough 
 Can you please complete me? 
 Or at least let me sleep with ease 
 Convince myself to at least release me 
 I wanna be more than my wealth more than my health 
 I think I need your help 
 Be all that I can more than a man that I am 
 But still not someone else 
 I put you down just projecting weight by the pound 
 That drowns my direction 
 Hate by the pound surrounds my reflection 
 I do this for my own protection 
 Reject it before I'm neglected, defective as it is 
 That's my directive, the simple truth is that, I feel protected 
 Only at times that we're connected, 'cause 
 I wanna be more than myself 
 I think I need your help 
 This song ain't gonna write itself 
 I think I need your help 
 This wrong ain't gonna right itself 
 I think I need your help 
 I wanna be more than you know 
 I just wanna, I just wanna 
 Lose myself, find myself, see myself 
 Be myself, lose myself, find myself 
 I just wanna, I just wanna 
 Lose myself, find myself, see myself 
 Be myself, lose myself, find myself 
 I just wanna, I just wanna 
 I wanna be more than myself 
 I think I need your help 
 I wanna be more than you know 
 I just wanna, I just wanna 
 I wanna be more than myself 
 I think I need your help 
 I wanna be more than you know 
 I just wanna, I just wanna 
 Lose myself in you 
 Find myself in you 
 See myself in you 
 Be myself with you 
 Save the drama 
 I'm far from a knight in shinning armour 
 I just do the best that I can as a man 
 I believe in Karma 
 Leaving the drama, is easily harder 
 When you find someone, easy to partner 
 They ask and its easy to answer 
 I think I have found what I seem to be after 
 'Cause 
 I wanna tune to your rhythm 
 I want a guide that relies on your wisdom 
 Open my eyes is closing my vision 
 So it's no surprise that I notice division 
 But 
 I wanna be more than the ordinary 
 Ain't you bored of the orderly? 
 Just a robot you know what 
 You could just order me 
 I, pretend I'm the remedy, but I could never be 
 'Cause of my energy, I am the enemy, always eventually 
 Back where it's meant to be, I'm just a remedy 
 So 
 Whatever the weather, however clever 
 You never, ever endeavour, to wrestle with for ever 
 Want to get better? Then we gotta sever 
 This big ego won' work together 
 I wanna be more than myself 
 I think I need your help 
 This song ain't gonna write itself 
 I think I need your help 
 This wrong ain't gonna right itself 
 I think I need your help 
 I wanna be more than you know 
 I just wanna, I just wanna 
 Lose myself, find myself, see myself 
 Be myself, lose myself, find myself 
 I just wanna, I just wanna 
 Lose myself, find myself, see myself 
 Be myself, lose myself, find myself 
 I just wanna, I just wanna 
 I wanna be more than myself 
 I think I need your help 
 I wanna be more than you know 
 I just wanna, I just wanna 
 I wanna be more than myself 
 I think I need your help 
 I wanna be more than you know 
 I just wanna, I just wanna 
 Lose myself in you
