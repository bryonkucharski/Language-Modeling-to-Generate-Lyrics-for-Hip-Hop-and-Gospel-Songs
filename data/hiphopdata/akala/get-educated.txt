Gordon Bennet 
 I'm flabbergasted 
 Smart Barstard 
 Why don't he plsy his role and just act retarded 
 'Cause when you're born single parent poor thts your place 
 Don't read too many books, sag your jeans screw your face 
 Chat shit 
 Act thick 
 Practice 
 Your backflips 
 Put your motherfucking arse out for the cameras 
 Providing entertainment for your cultural betters 
 Men of letters think we can only be good if they let us, 'cause 
 Knowledge ain't for punks, they market it like it is 
 'Cause who the fuck wants to be Carlton from fresh prince 
 But geeks designed the system devisions of poleticions 
 Marthis, and the smiths were livin' in their vison 
 So, Knowledge is power 
 For devouring cowards that showerd you 
 With propaganda each and every hour that's why 
 Malcolm never died as, just another tug on the road 
 A symbol over the globe 
 'Cause did you know? 
 The most rebellious thing you can do is get educated 
 Forget what they told you in school, get educated 
 I ain't sayin' play by the rules, get educated x4 
 Break the chains of their enslavement, get educated 
 Even if you're on the pavement, get educated 
 What a weapon that your brain is, get educated x2 
 We speak of power 
 When we speak of education 
 Free your body free your mind 
 What you think Toussaint did? 
 Planned rebellion, that's the way to use your brain kid 
 That's the only way were gonna make it outta this matrix but 
 Gotta know the basics 
 We can look around say that we hate it but 
 But how do we change it 
 Or rearrange it, all to replace it 
 Gotta step into the mind that designed ya 
 What do you reckon when you step into the fire 
 What are you reppin' is it definitely bias 
 Severing your effort in the ways they require? 
 Act like you're lesser than better 
 Severing (?) is clever 
 I know a bag of youths that act like they ain't clever 
 'Cause it's become fashionable to say we all clap a tool 
 Never symbols of the state, only those that look like you 
 So whose love are we doin', pursuin' our ruin 
 The riddle ain't very hard, brother you fill the clue in 
 So when we clappin' our tools and play the fool 
 We ain't breakin' the rules, it ain't very cool, you know what to do 
 So you want to hide something from Blacks 
 Then you should put it in a book 
 Still some brothers won't even look, it's like they shook 
 It's not just us, dumber you act the more they promote it 
 'Cause dumb people will not rebel, sure you know this 
 Yo, look at the dreams that they feed to our babies, your seeds 
 Look at the means that they tell us you make all the P's 
 Dumb celebrities say girls act like you're me 
 If you suck dick and film it, get a show on TV 
 Because we don't want too many women thinkin' like bell hooks 
 We want a bag of hookers that bend over and just cook 
 Our silicone addressers do anything to impress us 
 Of course a woman's life is lived just for the fellas 
 Much as the next man, I love a woman that's shaped up 
 But there's nothing more unattractive than a woman that play dumb 
 But the ego with a reason to see you 
 Lesser than equal to be you 
 But wanna keep you 
 At all the bullshit that we do deceitful 
 And we're evil 
 I wouldn't want to be you 
 Putting up with our bullshit, and I mean me too 
 The anger burns inside of me, violently, its dividing me 
 One moment I'm cool, the next I think that you're tryin' me 
 'Cause of course I believe in peace, theoretically, generally 
 But if you love something then you got to defend it, see 
 Not tellin' you be a coward, no coward could be a friend to me 
 You should know your enemy, cut the head of a centipede 
 But know the one whose head needs to get severed 
 For the one who just lives it 'cause they just don't really know no better 
 The yout across the block ain't your enemy brother 
 And if you really knew the truth you'd be defending each other
