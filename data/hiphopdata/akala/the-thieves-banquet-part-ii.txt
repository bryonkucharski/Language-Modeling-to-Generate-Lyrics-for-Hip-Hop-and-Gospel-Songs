Towards the end of the feast the devil decided 
 He was so inspired, he couldn't be bothered with giving no prizes 
 In fact he said he would just retire 
 'Cause he could see that what was required 
 To keep our children living in fire 
 Could be supplied by these thieves and these liars 
 Who had respectable titles 
 So he pronounced that he would bounce 
 Go back to hell as his house 
 Co-sign his work to these thieves like it was just an ounce 
 We know not what what was said 
 But still live with the effects 
 Of what was agreed by the greed 
 That night on the Banquet of thieves 
 The gist is this: The devil bestowed 
 All of the powers for ruling the globe 
 Only to those who would sell their soul 
 And take the devilish oath 
 I solemnly swear to steal and kill 
 Not because I'm hungry for meals 
 But because my hundreds and millions 
 I wanna see turned into billions 
 I solemnly swear to make a place 
 Where women and children are raped every day 
 Where some eat ourselves to death 
 And others can't get a crumb on the plate 
 I solemnly swear to turn the globe 
 Into a living hell for most 
 And drug with death, anything left 
 That grows or has a pulse 
 The monarchs and dictators, religious leaders and the bankers 
 Had one more course before they could complete the Banquet 
 Screaming and panting, baby children were brought on plates 
 The end of their tantrums came 
 When they were stabbed in the heart with a stake 
 And chopped into pieces, served raw with the blood still warm 
 All the thieves gobbled down the children without a second thought 
 The devil explained; if ever they got to a place where they suffered pain 
 Or the slightest of shame, for killing a child 
 They should leave the game 
 'Cause the noblest aim is to turn a child's flesh to flames 
 For the hollow concept called profit so known as personal gain 
 The devil explained, there is a god, death is his name 
 So treat this life as if it was nothing more than a monopoly game 
 So get to work 
 There's people to starve and people to slaughter 
 And also to torture, any rebellious son or daughter 
 If ever you fail, or find yourself getting to frail 
 An angry devil will be forced to return from the comfort of hell 
 All the thieves got up from their seats and gave the devil applause 
 Baby's blood dripping from their jaws, totally reddened the floor 
 With that the devil vanished 
 And left the thieves in the palace 
 The banker was the first to speak on how they could meet the challenge 
 Look my fellow thieves 
 As long as we unite on the scheme 
 We'll be living with dreams 
 There's never been a team this mean 
 Yes spiritual death 
 Is what I provide at the Devil's behest 
 Monarchs can make laws and the courts 
 That would serve and protect 
 Our interests and nothing else 
 Commoners can fuck themselves 
 'Cause we all see, democracy will just fuck up our wealth 
 That's where I can add some value 
 To this gathering of men 
 I can kill in broad daylight 
 I don't have to pretend 
 I can do the things that all you rich developed countries 
 Can't be seen to do in public 
 But we all know you love it 
 Yes! 
 And we can pretend we're enemies, still at war with each other 
 Though we couldn't be further from the truth we are practically lovers 
 You're quite right Mr. Banker deception must be used 
 We'll hire prostitutes to spread our views 
 And call it news 
 Another set of prostitutes that call themselves artists 
 To say what we tell them to 
 Spineless Bastards 
 Religious leader 
 Thou art a wonderful thief 
 The last thing that we do need before our schemes complete 
 Is a set of puppet politicians 
 That talk a lot 
 That the people think hold the power but they're really our dogs 
 Yes yes yes, yes oh fucking yes! 
 Let us drink to murder and theft 
 Until there's nothing left 
 The thieves took a toast of warm blood 
 And nearly drowned in laughter 
 The Bankers passed out a charter 
 That they had carefully drafted 
 For the international organisation 
 Of theft and murder 
 If we could sign this in blood 
 It would be totally perfect! 
 That's what they did 
 They used the child's bleeding finger 
 To sign a commitment 
 To keep the human spirit a prisoner 
 That's how it's been since then 
 A cannibalistic system 
 Run by themes dressed in death 
 Blessed with the Devil's wisdom
