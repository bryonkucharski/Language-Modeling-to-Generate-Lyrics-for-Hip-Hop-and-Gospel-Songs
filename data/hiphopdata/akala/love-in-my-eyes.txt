Remember when I met you? 
 Heart went racing 
 But I won't chase I was in a strange place then 
 Faking, what on my face was blatant 
 You could be mine but I'm scared of the taking 
 Pacing, I was not used to the waiting; contemplating 
 And I'm not talking about consummating 
 Just conversation, let alone debating 
 All the time in the world is all we've got and there's no need for waiting 
 All the thoughts in my mind of what we could find got me anticipating 
 Right now we're just friends and I like how we're shaping 
 Plus I need time for the doubts that I'm facing 
 Not about you, it's me who needs changing 
 Look on my face you'll see that I'm gazing 
 But life is no oasis 
 And soon things got complicated 
 So I jumped ship, real quick 
 'Cause I hit ship, sink and I really cannot take it 
 'Cause I've never been here before 
 In fact no where near before 
 I don't quite know 
 But I feel it from my afro to my big toe 
 It's not working and I need my space 
 Plus I gotta deal with this bullshit case 
 So we parted ways and it felt real strange 
 Didn't get much done with my days 
 How will we ever see eye to eye? 
 I don't agree with myself even half the time 
 Then it dawned on me, it's never plain sailing 
 You can't succeed if you're afraid of failing 
 All the time in the world is all we have 
 And there's no need for racing 
 All the thoughts on my mind of what we could find got me anticipating 
 Right now we're best friends and I like how we're shaping 
 Plus I got over the doubts I was facing 
 Couldn't change time but time had me changing 
 Now on my face you'll see when I'm gazing
