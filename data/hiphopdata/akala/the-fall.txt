In 1492 Columbus sailed the ocean blue 
 Being the cunt he was, the genocide that ensued 
 Was half a millennia of permanent blood bath 
 Today we celebrate the rapist and his fucked up past 
 Decimate a native, leave him in our path 
 Death and destruction, we kick back and we just laugh 
 When the culture values dogs more than certain humans 
 It is certain it will come up with the worst solution 
 Decimation, erase a nation and proudly stating 
 Nowadays the language has change 
 But it's the same shit since the Nazi's did within Europe 
 What Europeans was only supposed to do to natives 
 The word "genocide" now carries a little weight with it 
 But we don't really mean it, a killer is our patriot 
 Ain't nothin' better than a resource theft 
 Ain't nothin' more sexy than black and brown death 
 We'll tell you what is comin' yeah we'll tell you what is next 
 'Cause we've eaten here before, we're familiar with the chef 
 Hmm, what's cooking? The same dish, different dressing 
 The same priest, different confession 
 But will still give you a blessing yeah 
 A baptism in blood, in fact it was a flood 
 In fact it was some grub who packed triggers and mug 
 A whole nation, this is empire 
 The question is can we aspire to any higher? 
 We're living through the fall of the empire 
 We're living through the fall of the empire 
 And we don't even know what is meant by it 
 And we don't even know what is meant by it 
 We're living through the fall of the empire 
 We're living through the fall of the empire 
 And we don't even know what is meant by it 
 And we don't even know what is meant by it 
 See, any foundation that is built on greed 
 Raping and pillaging will never succeed 
 We're living in the age of information 
 Enslavement, call it colonization 
 I call is straight piss taking 
 Call it money or lose your debt making 
 Breath taking, soul destroying, back breaking 
 Where they crack whips for fake staters 
 Our society is broken down 
 So I don't get a loan or credit cards 
 See that is out of bounds 
 Freezing all your assets, stopping any bank or draws 
 Read in to the future 'cause the past is showing many flaws 
 We are not collateral, we are something greater than 
 Take a stand, let's all take our money out of filthy banks 
 Mental evolution, no confusion built communities 
 Until my last breath, I won't stop until we all are free 
 Shouting People's Army, see I kow there's something blessed in me 
 'Cause when it all falls down I know there's so much meant for we 
 We're living through the fall of the empire 
 We're living through the fall of the empire 
 And we don't even know what is meant by it 
 And we don't even know what is meant by it 
 Colonize and savage take what is a land 
 Then we justify it by claiming that we already had it 
 'Cause who needs facts when we got force? 
 Who needs their own minerals, we'll just take yours 
 We ain't talking bout music when we say tours 
 Rape mothers and mother nature 'cause they both are whores 
 Tell our kids every day that crime don't pay 
 But there's no way we believe the bullshit we say 
 'Cause it's as clear as the light of day 
 The light is lighting up the way 
 Of those who trade in graves 'cause death does pay 
 Supply arms to both sides in the fight 
 And if you ain't fighting you ain't paying attention to your alliance 
 I know something that we ain't learnt 
 Yeah, maybe hell is real and one day they'll burn 
 But in the meantime, sure they'll earn 
 Till their empires done and another one gets its turn 
 We're living through the fall of the empire 
 We're living through the fall of the empire 
 And we don't even know what is meant by it 
 And we don't even know what is meant by it 
 It's over, the fall 
 It's over
