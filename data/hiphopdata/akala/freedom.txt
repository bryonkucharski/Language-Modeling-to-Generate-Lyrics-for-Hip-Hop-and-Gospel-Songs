 I want freedom 
 I don't know the meaning and how to achieve them 
 'Cause freedom founded 
 I was thinking how freedom is 
 But that's the kind of freedom 
 That's crazy and make appealing 
 And all other forms of freedom 
 Is crazy dangerous demons 
 Pray your brains on the ceilings 
 For entertaining the meaning 
 It's political 
 Physical, spiritual and it's healing 'cause 
 Freedom is difficult 
 It requires a critical 
 Master the population 
 Not following the typical 
 Propaganda accused 
 Media supreming news 
 In fact it ain't even shock anymore 
 It's just real, mask killers 
 Dining on fine dinners 
 While preaching to us about freedom 
 Like we are

 Listen, I want to be free like the number 
 When I feel like to wonder 
 Don't want to feel like I'm under 
 But over saturated my imaginaticial wonder 
 Your boxers and cotton, is something I want to come to 
 'Cause I'm a freedom hunter 
 A true terrorist, a live killer 
 Me and Akala brought the pen inside, five fingers 
 It's musical medicine 
 Dude want to collide with us 
 We fighting the spiritual war 
 Can I get a further witness 
 More fire, more power 
 The worst hours 
 I can free myself for more these cowards 
 The up and downs 
 The biggest enemy ain't a coward 
 In my surrounds 
 My biggest enemy is the enemy 
 I'm a stoned gutter

 If knowledge is power then tell me please what is freedom 
 Can you define a single word that has many meanings 
 If you mean it, like I mean it 
 Do we really need it 
 Is definition another prisoner that we believe in 
 Can you be free in prison sitting in your cell 
 Can you be free of the system when you living in hell 
 Can you be free if the vision is too difficult to tell 
 'Cause we going round in circles like a dog chasing his tale 
 Time will tell, if we fell 
 If we live to tell the tale 
 If we will ever break the spells that they telling us well 
 And get free 
 Free from the pressure 
 Free from depression 
 Free from the lies they tell us in the history lessons 
 Free
