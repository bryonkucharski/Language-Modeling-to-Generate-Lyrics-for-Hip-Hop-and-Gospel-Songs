Dat boy Akala's a diamond fella 
 All you little boys are a comedy of errors 
 You bellow but you fellows get played like 
 The cello, I'm doing my ting 
 You're jealous like Othello. 
 Who you? what you gonna do? 
 All you little boys get Tamed like the Shrew 
 You're mid-summer dreamin' 
 Your tunes aren't appealing 
 I'm Capulet, you're Montague, I ain't feeling 
 I am the Julius Caesar hear me 
 The Merchant Of Venice couldn't sell your CD 
 As for me, All's Well That Ends Well 
 Your boy's like Macbeth, you're going to Hell 
 Measure for Measure, I am the best here 
 You're Merry Wives of Windsor not King Lear 
 I don't know about Timon 
 I know he was in Athens 
 When I come back like Hamlet you pay for your action 
 Dat boy Akala, I do it As You Like 
 You're Much Ado About Nothing 
 All you do is bite it 
 I'm too tight, I don't need 12 knights 
 All you little Tempests get murked on the mic 
 Of course I'm the one with the force 
 You're history like Henry IV 
 I'm fire, things look dire 
 Better run like Pericles Prince Of Tyre 
 Off the scale, cold as a Winter's Tale 
 Titus Andronicus was bound to fail 
 So will you if Akala get at ya 
 That's suicide like Anthony and Cleopatra 
 Cymbeline was a modern day Bridget Jones 
 Love's labours lost, a woman on her own 
 She needed Two Gentlemen Of Verona 
 This is Illa State and I am the owner 
 Wise is the man that knows he's a fool 
 Tempt not a desperate man with a jewel 
 Why take from Peter to go pay Paul 
 Some rise by sin and by virtue fall 
 What have you made if you gain the whole world 
 But sell your own soul for the price of a pearl 
 The world is my oyster and I am starving 
 I want much more than a penny or a farthing 
 I told no joke, I hope you're not laughing 
 Poet or pauper which do you class him 
 Speak eloquent, though I am resident to the gritty inner city 
 That's surely irrelevant 
 Call it urban, call it street 
 A rose by any other name, smell just as sweet 
 Spit so hard, but I'm smart as the Bard 
 Come through with a Union Jack, full of yard 
 Akala, Akala, where for art thou? 
 I am the black Shakespearian 
 The secret's out now 
 Chance never did crown me, this is destiny 
 You still talk but it still perplexes me 
 Devour cowards, thousands per hour 
 Don't you know the king's name is a tower 
 You should never speak it 
 It is not a secret 
 I teach thesis, like anicent Greece's 
 Or Egyptology, never no apology 
 In my minds eye, I see things properly 
 Stopping me, nah you could never probably 
 I bare a charmed life, most probably 
 For certain I put daggers in a phrase 
 I'll put an end to your dancing days 
 No matter what you say it will never work 
 Wrens can't prey 
 Where eagles don't perch 
 I'm the worst with th words 
 'Cause I curse all my verbs 
 I'm the first with a verse to rehearse with a nurse 
 There's a hearse for the first jerk who turn berserk 
 Off with his head, 'cause it must not work 
 Ramp with Akala, that's true madness 
 And there's no method in it, just sadness 
 I speak with daggers and the hammers 
 Of a passion when I'm rappin' I attack 'em 
 In a military fashion the pattern of my rappin' 
 Chattin couldn't ever map it 
 And I run more rings round things than Saturn 
 Verses split big kids wigs when I'm rappin' 
 That boy Akala, the black Shakespeare 
 Did not want to listen, when I said last year 
 Rich like a gem in Ethiope's ear 
 Tell them again 
 For them who never hear
