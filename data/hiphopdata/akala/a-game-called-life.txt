Um, In a game named life 
 In a game named life 
 In a game named life 
 In a game named... 
 A game named life where fools make the rules 
 And poets paint pictures with words that change nothing 
 Survival of the fittest they say, are they sure? 
 Or just the survival of those with the will to kill more? 
 The heart that thinks itself purely, surely is not hungry? 
 Hungry hearts know too well, the world is fuckery 
 And nature is indifferent to the suffering of infants 
 That think ourselves growing human beings and something special 
 But as fate would have it, I ain't buying the idea of fate 
 It seems we shape every place that we grace with hate 
 Depending which side of the fence or which epoch 
 You die a slow death or be singing from the treetops 
 Praise for the status quo, 'cause you're comfortable 
 Those who lost out in this lottery, ha, fuck 'em all 
 Nice with this roll of the dice, I'm quite proud and 
 I don't know if we will ever roll another time round 
 It's a game named life 
 In a game named life 
 In a game named life 
 In a game named life 
 In a game named life 
 Where the dice decide where I go 
 There I go, in a game named life 
 I dream to be let go 
 A game named life, where fools make the rules 
 And poets paint pictures with words that change nothing 
 Young child soldier, revolver not bluffing 
 In a game that teaches children to kill but can't love them 
 What is the journey of a bullet from the ground until we pull it? 
 A piece of earth made to blow holes in souls 
 I'd like to know does a child choose in its mother's core or before as just a sperm to be born in war? 
 Does another sperm choose greatness floating in his father's pleasure? 
 Or does the game only begin when the umbilical's severed? 
 Is that the reason babies born screaming? 
 Because they know they left the spirit world 
 To live here with no meaning among demons 
 That see them as nothing more than chess pieces 
 In a game named life where even the winners stop breathing 
 And the whole thing is as tedious as a tale that is told twice 
 We clone life but don't even own our own life 
 It's a game named life 
 In a game named life 
 In a game named life 
 In a game named life 
 In a game named life 
 Where the dice decide where I go 
 There I go, in a game named life 
 I dream to be let go 
 Sacrifice, pain and strife 
 This game named life is over 
 Before we even know 
 Life is a mirror always looking at you 
 It's not what we say or think, we are just what we do 
 With the time that is given it comes with no ribbon 
 Because life is not a gift to everyone that's living 
 Most of the moves are made before you took your first go 
 Some got a huge head start before their first role 
 So you could play with more skill than the other players 
 They will still be head because the past generations 
 Accumulated spaces so they could practice with acres 
 Illuminated arrangements so they could manage retainers 
 Are you foolish? They ain't racing we're chasing the pay slip 
 So they have won before even the game starts unless we change it 
 To another set of rules different from the fools 
 But to do that we are going to have to use their tools 
 And therein lies our greatest dilemma 
 In this game named life, who's playing it better? 
 It's a game named life 
 In a game named life 
 In a game named life 
 In a game named life 
 In a game named life 
 Where the dice decide where I go 
 There I go, in a game named life 
 I dream to be let go 
 It's a game named life 
 In a game named life 
 In a game named life 
 In a game named life 
 In a game named life 
 Where the dice decide where I go 
 There I go, in a game named life 
 I dream to be let go
