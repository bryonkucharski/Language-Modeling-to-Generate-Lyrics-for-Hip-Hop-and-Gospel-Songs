Yo, Akala, listen... 
 Who's the Gangsta? 
 We claim Gangsta 
 Hip hop tells us we're gangsta 
 But do we make the straps and the scales? 
 Or just pack the jails 
 So please ask yourself 
 Who's the gangsta? The real gangsta 
 I don't give a rat's arse 
 Or a rassclaat 
 Who you're spars are 
 Or where you par par 
 Don't start 
 Are your bars hard? 
 Have you mastered 
 How to spar with a bastard? 
 Been dark since the march of the Spartans 
 Before Eve ate the fruit of the garden 
 I was in pursuit of the truth like a slalom 
 Dodging these sergeants 
 Slave masters 
 Whether they cuffed or they feathered and tarred 'em 
 Same shit 
 Different Jargon 
 Same Clip 
 Different cartridge 
 Same whip 
 Different master 
 Look closer 
 We ain't got past it 
 The shackles are not tackled 
 They're just different 
 Cattle rattle and rattle 
 But they collect the dividends 
 We're a fuel for someone else's engine 
 We don't run a damn thing We're just pretending 
 So all the big talk, don't affect me 
 My elders lick banks So you can't impress me 
 With all the talk 'bout another man's gun 
 That we use to kill each other for fun 
 When the master sends the overseers to see us 
 We toss the weapon and run 
 Boy dem run in your yard diss your mother 
 Dashing her knickers all out of the cupboard 
 Got us face down with their feet on our neck 
 But we still believe we are vets 
 But... do we make the straps and the scales 
 Or just pack the jails 
 So please ask yourself 
 Who's the gangsta? 
 Do we make the planes and the boats 
 That import the coke? 
 So please ask yourself 
 Who's the gangsta? 
 We blow each other's brain in 
 So entertaining 
 They drop bombs of depleted Uranium 
 You broke the law? 
 You go to prison 
 They kill a couple million, stack a billion 
 Business as usual, death in the colonies 
 What is that but state to state armed robbery 
 Just a road move on a bigger level 
 Think we are mountains but we're just pebbles 
 Better yet a sand grain 
 Go pop a little champagne 
 But the people in the south of France are not our fans mate 
 Would love to live nice and happy too 
 But ask yourself this 
 Does anyone that you know control the flow of capital? 
 The answer is no 
 And if you knew the business deals man are negotiating 
 You would know you could never ever claim that I'm hatin' 
 Vegan 'cause but I get the bacon and eggs just fine 
 In case you're mistaken 
 And if I don't like that? 
 I don't like that 
 Grew up on Big Yout and Gregory Isaacs 
 No surprise that 
 Revolution on my track 
 Been right there from right back 
 Sacred Geometry 
 Don't follow me 
 Still just an angry yout that spits horribly 
 Trying to live peaceful, I remember 
 What happened the last time I lost my temper 
 And believe I ain't trying to be hard 
 The abuse that I suffered 
 I'm emotionally scarred 
 Supposed to be only beholding the bars 
 Instead I'm a professor that never went to class 
 I write literature, they write bars 
 The Celtic warrior, Marooned from yard 
 When you compare me to these little tarts 
 All you are showing is you're not very smart 
 Real MC it's my culture 
 Grew up on the sound systems with the toasters 
 You man'a put down 
 Its third gear to me 
 Tenth planet ain't not another one near to me 
 When I orbit 
 Clicks forfeit 
 'Course it flows 
 My yout don't force it 
 Or try brush man off 
 As just conscious 
 Come out my face with that nonsense 
 Tug revolution, that's what it is 
 Never do we run from one of these kids 
 If we ain't shook with the owners of the plantation 
 Why would we run from a slave? 
 We've all got goons 
 That love us enough to wanna die for us 
 So just behave 
 'Cause man'a old school straighteners 
 One two one two face of the haters 
 Chasing their papers 
 Nah! 
 Man are chasing freedom 
 But papers are making and blatantly shaking and quaking in their boots 
 Anytime you talk about breaking enslavement 
 So I do feel like Neo in the Matrix 
 'Cause I don't understand 
 Why is everybody so scared of the agents 
 When they are powerless blatant 
 Got a little bit, but I put it on the line 
 Listen to the shit that I spit in my rhymes 
 Ali at his prime, principal first 
 Even if it means that I don't get heard 
 'Cause the herds are absurd 
 Their hating the nerd 
 But the nerd's controlling the face of the earth 
 So I tell a man so straight I'm a nerd 
 But duppy a track at my worst 
 Cold as a blizzard in a furnace 
 A wizard of a wordsmith 
 Riddles that I chisel in stone 
 Perfect 
 Ask for yourself on the road 
 They'll tell you Akala is cold 
 He kicks knowledge for the block 
 Never gonna stop 
 Progression on my albums 
 Never gonna flop 
 When that shit's on 
 It starts to dawn 
 This whole shit is chess 
 And they want us to celebrate the fact that we are just pawns 
 But I am not on it 
 See 
 The last thing they want is man with road energy 
 To stop killing one another and think cleverly 
 And ask why you're living where you're living and how you're living 
 Did you create the conditions that you're raising you're kid in? 
 And if you didn't who did it? 
 Is it really for the hood 
 If our oppressors like our lyrics 
 If only by crushing your aspirations 
 Can they maintain this here situation 
 Only by destroying the dreams of your kids quick 
 Can they keep their unearned privileges 
 And that is what it's all about
