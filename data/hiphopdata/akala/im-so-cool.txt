I'm an emcee first so guess what shithead 
 I can be an arrogant prick too dickhead 
 We all got tugs on the road that spit lead 
 What you choose to promote what's your intent 
 Man done hundreds of shows no deal 
 Can count countries I been and I still 
 Ill shit kill shit red and blue pill shit 
 Talk sense but tugs still feel shit 
 14 in coliseum with big women 
 Every other week when the shots kept ringing 
 So pardon me if I don't give a fuck lately 
 But half of these bars emcees wanna spray me 
 Only care if you wanna educate me 
 Or great emcee like Biggie was baby 
 I've no response if you hate me 
 Don't lie to yourself claim that you don't rate me 
 Who else can make intelligence seem sexy 
 Girls try hard, still can't get me 
 Gotta be a queen, stay select 
 Grown man don't run when I get a wreck 
 Not any girl that can feel the sweat, heat 
 Push the mind sex and I change the technique 
 Who the fuck, you wanna claim you rep street 
 You ain't out there with the youts and get deep? 
 I'm so cool playing the game 
 But I make my own rules 
 I'm so cool stay in your lane 
 Or you'll get took to school 
 I'm so cool playing the game 
 But I make my own rules 
 I'm so cool, so cool so fucking cool 
 Many man talk shit but they got no talent 
 Everything that I spit classic 
 Known from Sudan to Zimbabwe the hard way 
 Livin' off the work of the words that the bard spray 
 Teaching my shit in the schools since the first disc 
 What would you think when I'm there, I'm a wordsmith 
 In the truest sense of the word have you heard prick 
 It's a new day absurd with my nerd shit 
 ...We know Akala we know that he reads 
 Never run from no guy and see men bleed 
 We all talk tough on the track oh please! 
 You ain't out there on the street 
 I am not Superman 
 You are not Superman 
 But I don't need to pretend that I am 
 I'd rather fight with the right foe that has stole land 
 Soul stone cold put a price on your soul man 
 You can take my wisdom for weakness sweetness 
 Don't believe that 'turn the other cheek' shit 
 Fuck Akala with all that deep shit? 
 Please tell me, really what's street shit 
 Italian designers, chilling on the block with you 
 Shot rocks, pop Glocks, hop blocks with you? 
 We own the straps and the scales? 
 Or the fashion sales? 
 Or... just pack the jails 
 I'm so cool playing the game 
 But I make my own rules 
 I'm so cool stay in your lane 
 Or you'll get took to school 
 I'm so cool playing the game 
 But I make my own rules 
 I'm so cool, so cool so fucking cool 
 A military mind since back in 04 
 Who's relevant from then it's oh so poor 
 Emcees come through and the last one sees 
 And I'm bleeding and breathing the meaning we feel it 
 Don't want credit for the message I discuss 
 Nuff' conscious emcees are boring as fuck 
 Credit 'cause my swag, is fly through the roof 
 A bop when I spit the fire in the booth 
 Credit 'cause I am the best emcee 
 Oh lord dear God just flee fuck me! 
 Credit 'cause I am oh so original 
 You ain't the only bro that knows criminals 
 Don't shout out my OG's on the track 
 They're way too serious for all of that crap 
 Man's that buy yard and (yawnin) in Ghana 
 Might be gangstas but always were fathers 
 Can't rate man that is smuggling parada 
 'Cause yout dem a struggle it's dumb fuck retarded 
 Few emcees have got the game twisted 
 Don't be ashamed you're earnin' an honest living 
 How many fucked up 'cause our dad's in prison 
 And if they were around there would be less killing 
 And if you must die then die for the right cause 
 Die like a muthafuckin' man in the right war 
 Die like Toussain 
 Die like Dessaline 
 Die like Malcolm 
 Scheming on a better dream 
 Die for your family 
 Die for your Kids home 
 Don't die for a dumb block that you don't own 
 I'm so cool playing the game 
 But I make my own rules 
 I'm so cool stay in your lane 
 Or you'll get took to school 
 I'm so cool playing the game 
 But I make my own rules 
 I'm so cool, so cool so fucking cool
