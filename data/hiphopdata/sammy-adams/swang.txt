Yeah 
 Sammy Adams 
 Swing your drank, but if you ballin' swing that bottle 
 Yeah 
 Swing a drank if you balling swing a bottle 
 We in the club get your girl back tomorrow 
 'Cause we get it poppin' only hitting models 
 If you ain't a ten get your hands off my bottle 
 I'm up in the club chillin' with a couple twelves 
 Bottles of the Goose rollin' up a couple L's 
 Heaven bound? I don't know, I might go to Hell 
 'Cause you know I'm a sinner. Baby girl you couldn't tell? 
 Now I'ma get my mind, get my mind, get my mind right 
 Hard to not be the man, catch me in the limelight 
 Catch me at my table standing on the joint 
 Two chords and my mic and my mac are connected like cable 
 Shorty swing your drank to the side then drop it 
 I can fill you up my supply's not stopping 
 'Cause we hit the club and it's just like shopping 
 Any bottle that you like, girl go cop it 
 Swing a drank if you balling swing a bottle 
 We in the club get your girl back tomorrow 
 'Cause we get it poppin' only hitting models 
 If you ain't a ten get your hands off my bottle 
 Swing a drank if you balling swing a bottle 
 We in the club get your girl back tomorrow 
 'Cause we get it poppin' only hitting models 
 If you ain't a ten get your hands off my bottle 
 Yeah 
 V.I.P. and your girl's trying to roll 
 She's about 26, chick you a little old 
 Not to mention that you only care about my dough 
 Or the fact that I can spit it any stage, any show 
 We livin' in a world that they say is so cold 
 But life's good baby 'cause my champagne gold 
 My girls stay hot when the wintertime goes 
 And they all know who they are they ain't nothing if they don't 
 [?] Shoes with a black dress matching 
 3 bottles poured up call that a hat trick 
 Yeah 
 Just wanna see you jump till your knees can't bend 
 My entourage deep so you need your friends 
 Hop up in the Beem with the two [?] 
 Plus four on the rims 
 That's what we be in 
 Like what you see? Baby please come taste it 
 Not a Jersey boy but I am the situation 
 Swing a drank if you balling swing a bottle 
 We in the club get your girl back tomorrow 
 'Cause we get it poppin' only hitting models 
 If you ain't a ten get your hands off my bottle 
 Swing a drank if you balling swing a bottle 
 We in the club get your girl back tomorrow 
 'Cause we get it poppin' only hitting models 
 If you ain't a ten get your hands off my bottle 
 Swing your drank, swing your bottle 
 (Swang, Swang) 
 (4x) 
 Swing a drank if you balling swing a bottle 
 We in the club get your girl back tomorrow 
 'Cause we get it poppin' only hitting models 
 If you ain't a ten get your hands off my bottle 
 Swing a drank if you balling swing a bottle 
 We in the club get your girl back tomorrow 
 'Cause we get it poppin' only hitting models 
 If you ain't a ten get your hands off my bottle 
 Uh

 Maybe your drinks do 
 (Hahaha) 
 That's why we got bottle service baby 
 All night 
 Oh yeah
