Sammy Adams 
 Comin' up, comin' up. 
 Yeah, Boston 
 Matty Trump 
 Yeah, uh 
 Uh, uh, uh 
 I'm comin' up, I'm comin' up on it 
 Running airlines from LA to Boston 
 Can't stop and I told you I promised 
 So you ain't gonna hear nobody that's hotter (hotter) 
 Hear nobody that's hotter, ain't nobody that's hotter 
 Nobody hotter, ain't nobody that's hotter 
 What up haters, I'm back so how's my dick taste? 
 I'm spitting grimy, like mouths without toothpaste 
 Never thought of mixing blood with my confidence 
 She was in my city, showing love to me's the consequence 
 Cause my wills coming, whether or not you're liking it 
 Felt like the tip of the pen that checks the counterfeits 
 Like, your girl ain't never heard of me 
 Sike, 'cause she'd probably search the world for me 
 Ha, ha, ha, ha I laugh on tracks 
 You burst face to go hard cause your ass can't rap 
 About to take all, see the stripes and the stars on my window 
 Plane flying on the air pitch dark 
 I'm comin' up, I'm comin' up on it 
 Running airlines from LA to Boston 
 Can't stop and I told you I promised 
 So you ain't gonna hear nobody that's hotter 
 Hear nobody that's hotter, ain't nobody that's hotter 
 Nobody hotter, ain't nobody that's hotter 
 I told my parents that I was gonna get some 
 Hop on stage and get higher than a jet, son 
 Getting love told me why you never getting none 
 Born to the game, never pose as a step-son 
 I'm that new to iTunes, what's next shit 
 Rewind that track, what time before I exit 
 Like I could give a fuck, really what y'all think 
 Destiny is blessing, bartender give me a tall drink 
 So I could fade out, dreams of being played out 
 City radio I'm good and look at how I made out 
 Uh, on the stroll my path's paved, telling me to do it all up 
 So now I'm off stage, taking shots, I'm just trying get in cage 
 Coming up bar, see the numbers on the fan page 
 Can't stop 'cause they want 'em on the airwaves 
 Late night in Boston, west coast in the LA 
 I'm comin' up, I'm comin' up on it 
 Running airlines from LA to Boston 
 Can't stop and I told you I promised 
 So you ain't gonna hear nobody that's hotter 
 Hear nobody that's hotter, ain't nobody that's hotter 
 Nobody hotter, ain't nobody that's hotter 
 And my sky line's so contagious 
 Jet fuel on my tongue, ain't hungover 'cause I'm wasted 
 Chewing on success, so close I can taste it, 
 Came too far, homie feel like I'mma make it 
 Yeah, and you know I'm gonna get 'em 
 Agencies hawking, never can forget 'em 
 Slowly moving strong in positions that I'm winning 
 Better let 'em know 
 (Sammy Adams yeah tell 'em) 
 I'm comin' up, I'm comin' up on it 
 Running airlines from LA to Boston 
 Can't stop and I told you I promised 
 So you ain't gonna hear nobody that's hotter 
 Hear nobody that's hotter, ain't nobody that's hotter 
 Nobody hotter, ain't nobody that's hotter
