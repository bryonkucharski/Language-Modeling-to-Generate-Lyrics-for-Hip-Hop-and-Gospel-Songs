And I'm ok baby, I'm just fine 
 And I must step back, and close my eyes 
 I can't see the ground 'cause I'm so high 
 I'm so I'm so I'm so high 
 That's just the way it goes 
 Rock bottom watching my inspiration fold 
 Thrown in the game, no warm-up but I ain't cold 
 Transition from ice cold to luke warm 
 Wanna feel my story homie come and put my shoes on 
 Yeah, Cause since the beginning people be hatin' 
 When I see 'em I'm just grinnin' 
 (What up hatas) 
 Grew up in the city blowin' Ls while we winnin' 
 You know I'm going just had as hard in the ninth inning 
 As the first thanks Boston for Raisin' me 
 Thoughts clear with a splash of complacency 
 Sammy Adams the prey of the agencies 
 Unless it's Ari Gold 
 Homie get the fuck away from me 
 Waitin' on the game so patiently 
 Living life styles that you would think were make believe 
 Never stole a swag, bit a line, none of this 
 I only did me thinking how I could become the shit 
 And I'm ok baby, I'm just fine 
 And I must step back, and close my eyes 
 I can't see the ground 'cause I'm so high 
 I'm so I'm so I'm so High 
 So high, dodging jets straight, straight yay flow (zoom) 
 No pipe dreams, getting pesos 
 But I'd rather get love, get besos, 
 Tracks on repeat, girls asking who makes those 
 Give a damn if your boys don't like me 
 I'm on track now like Nike, almighty, 
 If you get money just tend to it politely 
 If you get bars, beating me is unlikely 
 Always had a chance 
 You never had a glance 
 I'm the cool kid in the meetings, 
 When others would piss they pants 
 Head up in the clouds, sophisticated stance 
 While my body's in the office, supplyin' their demands 
 And every hour in the booth that I'm getting paid for 
 Wonder why it's dark outside, and where today go 
 'Cause it's easy to get your name known, 
 When everything you're recording is straight fuego 
 And I'm ok baby, I'm just fine 
 And I must step back, and close my eyes 
 I can't see the ground 'cause I'm so high 
 I'm so I'm so I'm so high
