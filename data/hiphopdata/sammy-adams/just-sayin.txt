 Champs league 
 Chicks at my table lookin' at me all perplexed 
 Like if you ain't interested in me at least give me sex 
 What's next 
 Take over electro, get dough 
 Longer than a giraffes neck go lets go 
 Wanna party with animals baby lets live 
 Rollin' up while my manager checks in 
 Your girl came through my spot with a terrence 
 Told me she was dolo so they heated when they rolled in 
 Secretary askin time on the weekday 
 For you and homies to come check them on reply 
 Iyaz runnin' that solo no relay 
 Juice all up in my rhymes 
 Who are these lames 
 Wake up tip on to the next one 
 Am I running this game no question 
 Sammy MP3 on the kick drum 
 Drill us up don't matter where we come from 
 Who are they playin', who are they playin', who are they playin' 
 I'm just sayin', I'm just sayin', I'm just sayin' 
 Third wind haven't slept don't plan on it 
 Rather smoke a couple grams go spit flawless 
 Yup, the studio lookin' like my home 
 I'm gettin' views like apps on the iphone 
 Yeah, on tracks keep 'em local 
 I might head down south MP3 get Loco 
 Yeah, but I'm fine like Ocho 
 Touchdown drivin' my label gettin' more dough 
 And I'm winnin' over the promo 
 Shit I'm burnin got me movin in slo-mo 
 From the biv that we burnin in the studio 
 For all my fans I love y'all the truest song 
 Wake up tip on to the next one 
 Am I running this game no question

 I'm just sayin', I'm just sayin', I'm just sayin' 
 Who are they playin', who are they playin', who are they playin' 
 I'm just sayin', I'm just sayin', I'm just sayin' 
 Who are they playin', who are they playin', who are they playin' 
 I'm just sayin', I'm just sayin', I'm just sayin' 
 Wake up tip on to the next one
