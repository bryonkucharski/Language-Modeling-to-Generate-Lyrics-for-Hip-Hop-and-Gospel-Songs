Don't let it go to waste 
 Go to waste 
 Go to waste 
 Go to waste 
 Don't let it go to waste 
 Oh yeah, yeah 
 I say life's what you make it 
 Whether you working nights or day shift 
 Extra money on the side as a waitress 
 While you go to school, tryna keep your grades straight 
 You a dropout 
 Never fit in with the crowd, getting cropped out 
 In every picture that your crew and cool friends post on Facebook 
 A Twitter or whatever they on 
 And it's no wonder why you feel alone 
 Parents moved so much you never had a home 
 Just tune out the world, you can turn me on 
 No, I'm just here for you for a couple songs 
 No, I'm just here for you for a couple songs 
 So tell me what your pain is 
 Being you what defined you as a great kid 
 It's the easy way out so go get wasted 
 But if you get a chance to change don't waste it 
 Every day 
 That you wanna change 
 And break away 
 And break away 
 Every day ay ay 
 That you get faded 
 While they get famous 
 It's also takin' it 
 Don't let it go to waste 
 Go to waste 
 Go to waste 
 Go to waste 
 Don't let it go to waste 
 You gon wake up on the right side 
 Instead of lookin' back you lookin' for the bright side 
 Oh you got a good look from a bad chick 
 And some other shit that you didn't expect to happen 
 See the point of the story kid is to dream big 
 You never know what's gonna be there when the saints wakes 
 Could be you on a soldout stage 
 Just the fans that raise anything you say 
 I'm talkin' to everybody in the world 
 Who's ever been scared of reach 
 Who's ever been scared of girls 
 Who's ever been scared of boys 
 I'm talkin' to all of y'all 
 Telling you stay true, I'm telling you stand tall 
 'Cause all it takes is one move to be on your way 
 Whether you're tall, fat, skinny, pretty, straight or gay 
 Seems easy to say fuck it and get wasted 
 But if you get a chance to change don't waste it 
 Every day 
 That you wanna change 
 And break away 
 And break away 
 Every day ay ay 
 That you get faded 
 While they get famous 
 It's also takin' it 
 Don't let it go to waste 
 Go to waste 
 Go to waste 
 Go to waste 
 Don't let it go to waste 
 You got caught off a good thing 
 Get a job, just becoming something routine 
 And you feel like the whole world hates 
 But it's something that your soul can't fix so 
 Take a deep breath, take a step back 
 Know you good as long as you can get past 
 All the pressure but it's close till you taste it 
 But if you get a chance to change don't waste it 
 Every day 
 That you wanna change 
 And break away 
 And break away 
 Every day ay ay 
 That you get faded 
 While they get famous 
 It's also takin' it 
 Don't let it go to waste 
 Go to waste 
 Go to waste 
 Go to waste 
 Don't let it go to waste
