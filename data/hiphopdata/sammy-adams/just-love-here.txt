I, I got so much to say 
 Don't even know how to say it 
 All this hype, all this noise 
 I'm ready 
 First stop high school rookie 
 Not a single fan writing rhymes playing hookie 
 Back around the time Fred Durst got nookie 
 Couple years before my ass had ever seen pussy 
 Yeah, young Sammy with a fantasy 
 Found my mind first time I blew a gram of tree 
 Used to hate on my brotha 'cause I didn't see 
 That good weed made a shackled man feel free 
 But they could never see that, nope 
 And my music seemed weak 
 Embarrassed to play me tracks embarrassed to be me 
 Yeah, stepped up with my levels on the beats 
 Made a damn anthem for my high school team 
 But no features, packed bleachers 
 Hearing myself blast out of car speakers 
 And that's when I started to believe and finally realized 
 I should let myself succeed (I should let myself succeed) 
 And when I leave stage, and the limelight 
 And the groupie girls, when the times right 
 And I fly home back to my life 
 With my fam around me yeah it sounds right 
 When I leave LA with my mind right 
 On a couch at home for the whole night 
 No drugs here, just love here 
 Just love here 
 Next stop tears in my eyes 
 Remembering the person I was so set to disguise 
 Packing up for college no parents at the time 
 Starting a new chapter of Sammy Adams life 
 Write, and my got better 
 Spittin' everyday new vocabs clever 
 I Hate College allowed me to enter 
 The realm of popularity I thought I'd reach never 
 Ever, and loves an endeavor 
 I want my girl to love me but my music wont let her 
 Chasing all my dreams while I float like a feather 
 Yeah, and my grades going south, 
 But as an intellectual I needed to get out so 
 I visited to see what it was bout 
 And being close to Boston it made a better route 
 These fake ass promoters stay running their mouth 
 Reacting to what they say with a handful of doubt, ouch 
 And when I leave stage, and the limelight 
 And the groupie girls, when the times right 
 And I fly home back to my life 
 With my fam around me yeah it sounds right 
 When I leave LA with my mind right 
 On a couch at home for the whole night 
 No drugs here, just love here 
 Just love here 
 Third stop, waiting at my gate, 
 This home sick feeling is something I can't shake 
 But make no mistake I was born to do this 
 Born to make music, boy I'm gon' prove it 
 I can't sleep on the flight 
 Which isn't helping out 'cause I can't sleep at night 
 And even with some Ambien a half of bar bites 
 Consumes my damn stomach which continues to be tight 
 Yeah, and my dreams will ignite 
 On hooks while we fight 
 Fan base broad, real click slight 
 Focused on point I'm tryin' to live right 
 Right and I'm about to graduate 
 And all these agencies know how to aggravate, 
 I wish they would just leave me alone 
 I just wanna go home, I just wanna go home 
 (But I also want the throne) 
 And when I leave stage, and the limelight 
 And the groupie girls, when the times right 
 And I fly home back to my life 
 With my fam around me yeah it sounds right 
 When I leave LA with my mind right 
 On a couch at home for the whole night 
 No drugs here, just love here 
 Just love here
