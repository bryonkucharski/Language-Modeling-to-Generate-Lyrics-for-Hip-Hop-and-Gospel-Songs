Yeah, RIP Kim 
 That's all right 
 That's okay 
 We take a couple poppers and we get to that gate 
 Twist up over heaven 
 Every single day 
 The days we chilled 
 Talked shit 
 Got Laid 
 And hey 
 Sucks when it happens to those who can take it 
 But your life Kimb should be celebration 
 So we gunna embrace it 
 Till we see your face kid 
 Till then can't wait to see you again 
 Can't wait to see you again 
 Can't wait to see you ah 
 Without love we perish 
 Like losing another brother we cherish 
 Not to mention all such parents 
 Make you wonder what got these fairings hung 
 We could walk through fairness 
 Seeing Kimber O.C. marriage 
 Sipping on some young so careless 
 Wonder right now what he's wearing 
 Chillin' up in the stars 
 Still can't believe he's gone 
 Kimber you still live on 
 Through the lyrics of this song 
 Just know that we love you kid 
 No, man, no I just stopped the tip 
 We hating the game up rocket ship 
 And this is why I spark a blizz 
 That's all right 
 That's okay 
 We take a couple poppers and we get to that gate 
 Twist up over heaven 
 Every single day 
 The days we chilled 
 Talked shit 
 Got Laid 
 And hey 
 Sucks when it happens to those who can take it 
 But your life Kimb should be celebration 
 So we gunna embrace it 
 Till we see your face kid 
 Till then can't wait to see you again 
 Can't wait to see you again 
 Can't wait to see you ah 
 My Dude, my Bro, my Dog 
 Never thought I would see you gone 
 And you know I pray to God you with us when these times are hard 
 And if I had these calls 
 Tonight your life be here with ours 
 But you never had to make a song 
 Loved your Case, your Dad, your mom 
 And I look up in the sky 
 When I get lonely 
 Or I get high 
 Put on Kimber 
 Blast this shit 
 Till my fucking tears coincide 
 And you know I die inside when I hear this shit on rock 
 Just let it rock, yeah 
 Just let it rock, yeah 
 That's all right 
 That's okay 
 We take a couple poppers and we get to that gate 
 Twist up over heaven 
 Every single day 
 The days we chilled 
 Talked shit 
 Got Laid 
 And hey 
 Sucks when it happens to those who can take it 
 But your life Kimb should be celebration 
 So we gunna embrace it 
 Till we see your face kid 
 Till then can't wait to see you again 
 Can't wait to see you again 
 Can't wait to see you ah
