Uh, check it out now 
 Uh, no doubt now 
 Uh, yo, check it out now 
 Uh, no doubt, yo 
 Special girl, real good girl 
 Biggest thing in my itty bitty world 
 Called her up and she made me feel right 
 Wish bliss could never take flight 
 Sittin' back with this mic in my hand 
 Spittin' hot shit tryin' to see grand 
 Imprinted on my mind every minute 
 Make my plans and you always in it, yo 
 It's such a vivrant thing, 
 Vivrant thing, a vivrant thing 
 And even though we both fly 
 Give each other space and not the evil eye 
 Actin' like grownups 
 Don't even try to hide cause the spot blown up 
 Girlfriend tellin' you she wanna see 
 I say 'I dunno' but you say 'Gladly' 
 And when we both do hemp 
 We go on and on and on and on and on and 
 Sweeter than Ben and Jerry 
 Can I rhyme? 
 Well you know I gets mine 
 Sittin' round in my abstract part 
 This abstract thing doin' abstract parts, yo 
 Gettin' back to my MC status 
 All the willy that I kick make the other niggas mad as 
 Movin, to your town and situation 
 Shorty thought she subtle but she really was blatant when she 
 Shook her thing and violated 
 Now these wolf-like thoughts are formulated 
 I'm sayin', 'Yo is this some heart felt shit in here' 
 Am I a strongman nigga well shit yeah 
 Plus we can hold a convo 
 Or go to the movies, my crib, whatever yo 
 Just wanna see you by my side 
 We on 95, know the stash is in the ride 
 A rappin' nigga for real 
 You would find me in a cypher if I didn't cop a deal 
 Rap slate like big grate 
 You buy, I sell, we split big cake 
 Uh uh, just move your little thing 
 Move it around and shake your little thing 
 Uh Uh
