To all the lowriders, and big-riders 
 Lowride 
 What happened in the car yo? 
 F'real, let a nigga 
 Brand new Truck butter soft seat 
 4 point something with a low ridin' something 
 Ain't nothing better than to ride out the hood with it 
 Who looking better and damn you looking good in it 
 Take a chance with a nigga in the choice ride 
 Listen to the CD's I play inside 
 Mos Def, Jay, Prince and Stevie 
 Marvin Gaye, Led Zeppelin and Biggie 
 And when the evening is over love 
 Gonna find a nice spot for the Rover love 
 Do things to make the man in the moon blush 
 My mind race but I tell my waist don't rush 
 You's a upper echelon piece 
 So when you find there's a stash then you don't freak 
 You wanna nibble on a nigga ear 
 And do all the things that make a nigga wanna get near 
 Oh I'm a Queens representative 
 Get wild by any means my incentive is 
 When we done, I start it up again 
 And ride round with you cause you my special friend 
 Me and you, I think we should ride 
 Come on, come on, come on, come on 
 Don't worry just come get inside 
 Come on, come on, come on, come on 
 The second cut, my ride is like art 
 We get creative in it when we take it out and spin it 
 The backseat is the canvas we paintin on 
 Abstract, the work we create an own 
 The TV's in the back and the dash too 
 Got miss napkins and bamboo 
 Don't worry, the tints passed the legal one 
 Outkast's banging loud in my eardrum 
 The way the wheels spin cutting through the still wind 
 Outsiders looking in with the ill grin 
 Fuel injected brand new inspected 
 Emissions got tested details perfected 
 Got the Armor All touch, empty out the dutch 
 No tobacco spillin on my rug klutz 
 Kick off your shoes show off your peticure 
 Shake off the blues we all forgettin more 
 More of that thing 
 Stuff that brings ecstasy makin' you cling 
 A little harder than your average hug or grab 
 Lady tell me this is better than takin' a cab 
 And when you bounce, tell all your girls 
 You rode around hot-wheelin drinkin', no earl 
 Vacationin, V up my V8 
 Just one night we drive and we escape 
 Me and you, I think we should ride 
 Come on, come on, come on, come on 
 Don't worry just come get inside 
 Come on, come on, come on, come on 
 Me and you, I think we should ride 
 Come on, come on, come on, come on 
 Don't worry just come get inside 
 Come on, come on, come on, come on
