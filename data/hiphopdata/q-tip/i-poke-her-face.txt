So, what's the deal, why you frontin' keep it real 
 Do you wanna get funky with me? 
 If you think eye got something that you want, 
 Suga nothin' here comes for free 
 Eye been around this way 
 Got lost and found 
 Lemme see if you remember my name 
 You can try to get it but eye can't let you hit it 
 'Cause you never gon' be the same 
 I got a box a chocolates 
 That'll rock the sox of any 
 Girl that wanna come my way 
 And eye ain't got no time to waste 
 If she ain't makin' bank and scared of 
 What a brutha got to say 
 She want the b-o-x-a-chocolate everyday 
 So what's the deal are you sportin' some wheels 
 Or are you ridin' in a limousine? 
 This ain't prom night and eye don't wanna 
 Fight so you betta get your dirty clean 
 Eye hear your words goin' up and down your 
 Skirt your gonna get a chance to prove it 
 You best believe if you wanna get wit me 
 It takes a real woman to do it 
 (Chorus (q-tip)) 
 So what's the deal are you gay or poppin' pills? 
 Why you still wanna take my hand? 
 This discotech is 'bout to make me a wreck 
 My feet are singin' louder than the band 
 Eye see you got the feelin' 
 Flashin' lights up on the ceiling 
 Say you gotta get your weekend now 
 What difference does it make? 
 You know you can't make chocolate cake 
 If ain't nobody ever showed you how 
 She want the b-o-x-a-chocolate everyday
