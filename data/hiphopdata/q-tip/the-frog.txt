 She's waitin' for me now, man, don't wanna blow the move, man 
 'Cause you know I gotta go to her place 
 I go to another space when I look at her face 
 And look at her eyes they're deep like pools of water 
 I'm really turned on now and I know that I oughta 
 Hold her hand, let my love pour dance on the dance floor 
 If you can't dance, baby, I can show you 
 Jus' clap yo' hand and let the music take you 
 And put your foots in, and let it all shake ya 
 And take yo' head and put you hands up, ah 
 And shake your waist, ah, and you can tip it up 
 Just move your hands, eh, and move your waist, eh 
 You're looking in my eyes and in my face, ah 
 And then I feel you when I keep pace, ah 
 And then we dance, and we let the music happenin' 
 We fall in love all over again, again, again, we say

 Gotta girlie lookin' at me, peeping at my hood, man 
 No time to waste when you're up in the spout 
 'Cause there's too many boppers that make my cock block 
 So I git myself together, make sure I'm looking smooth, man 
 Walk up pumpin' it as, and what you do, man 
 She tol' me she chillin' and they doin' nothin' 
 So I said maybe later we can get in the sun 
 We can skip to a diner and sip a little coffee 
 And talk about hip hop stars and astronomy 
 By the way baby what's your sign

 And this was her favorite dish 
 And I never met a virgin pretty like this
