 Hasty decisions we may still prevail 
 Both needed breaks, we both needed to bail 
 Walking through the corridors of my mind 
 The hideaways, the nooks, there filled with good times 
 Memories certainly yes they still bind 
 Still a common man and yeah that's for sure 
 Still a bankroll and yeah still can tour 
 The madness, the thing we had was much more 
 Come back home, don't be out in the world 
 It's a rat race and always for a girl 
 And most scavengers have found the pretty pearl 
 It's for the faint of heart who never get enough 
 Gotta get tough, buckle 'em up, we call 'em duds 
 And we, and we and we ah 
 We gotta gettin' up 
 We gotta gettin' up 
 Today is nice come on we gettin' up 
 Said we gettin' up 
 Said we gettin' up 
 Tonight is right come on we gettin' up 
 Said we gettin' up 
 Said we gettin' up 
 Come over here baby, don't look so grumpy 
 This kind of lifestyle could be so comfy 
 We can start a clan just like the Kennedy's 
 You and I advance, certainly we can expand 
 Feelings that should never end 
 And you respect me like a friend 
 But love me like your man 
 No other could contend 
 Or we could be like Doves exposed 2 history 
 Like staying with each other with truth and chivalry 
 The things we go through they shape our identity 
 Yes pretty let's do this all night 
 Consummate this thing and make it all right 
 And when we cuddle up and promise that it's right 
 We gotta gettin' up 
 We gotta gettin' up 
 Today is nice come on we gettin' up 
 Said we gettin' up 
 Said we gettin' up 
 Tonight is right come on we gettin' up 
 Said we gettin' up 
 Said we gettin' up 
 I like to watch everybody gravitate towards you 
 Your magnetic presences make them come through 
 The same way you got them you got me too 
 Now look at our lives so colorful 
 A wonderful spectrum, not 1 tone dull 
 Full of excitement and not 1 lull 
 See we had an understanding, oh yes we did 
 I'm bringing it back, I'm puttin' in my bid 
 Have a couple of kids, have a couple of cribs 
 We like Louie D and [? ] like martin and corretta 
 Doin' it to death, no one can do it better 
 When we leave our physical our sprits still together 
 Come on now, here's a placement for your hand 
 You rockin' with the #1 MC man 
 The #1 controller of right with the plan 
 We gotta gettin' up 
 We gotta gettin' up 
 Today is nice come on we gettin' up 
 Said we gettin' up 
 Said we gettin' up 
 Tonight is right come on we gettin' up 
 Said we gettin' up 
 Said we gettin' up
