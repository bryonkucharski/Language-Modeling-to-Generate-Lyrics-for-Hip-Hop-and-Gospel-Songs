1-2 1-2 keep it on 
 Listen to the shit because we kick it until dawn 
 Listen to the abstract got it going on 
 Listen to the ladies come on and let me spawn 
 All your eggs then you you go up the river 
 Listen to the abstract that freaky nigger 
 I'm ad rock and I shock and I tick and I tock 
 And I can't stop with the body rock 
 See I've got heart like john starks 
 Hitting mad sparks 
 Pass me the mic 
 And I'll be rocking the whole park 
 I'm the m to the see to the a and it's a must 
 The rhymes that we bust on the topic on lust 
 And my moms is not butt, but fuck it 
 Let me get down to the rhythm 
 Yes I'm getting funky and I'm shooting all my jism 
 Like john holmes, the x-rated nigger 
 Listen to the shit 'cause I'm the ill figure 
 Nobody's getting any bigger than this 
 Ad rock down with the ione 
 Listen to the shit because both of them is boney 
 Got to do it like this like chachi and joanie 
 Because she's the cheese and I'm the macaroni 
 So why all the fight and why all the fuss 
 Because I ain't got no dust 
 Yea, you know I'm getting silly 
 I've got a grandma hazel and a grandma tilly 
 Grand royalprez and I'm also a member 
 Born on the cusp in the month of November 
 I do the patty duke in case you don't remember 
 Well, I freak a funky beat like the shit was in a blender 
 Well, I'm long gone word is born 
 Don't need a mother fucking fool telling me right from wrong 
 I don't think I'm slick nor do I play like I'm hard 
 But I shall drive the lane like I was evan bernhard 
 And I've working on my game because life is taxing 
 Got to get it together and see what's happening 
 I go one two like my name was biz mark 
 But I had to do the shit just let me embark 
 On the lyric and the noun and the verb 
 Let's kick the shit off 'cause yo, I'm not the herb 
 Well, it's not the herb but the spice with the flavor to spare 
 Tho moog with the funk for your derriere 
 While we're on that topic, yes I like to mention 
 When it comes to boning I'm representing 
 Spacing, zoning, talkin' on the phone and 
 My brain is roaming and I don't know where it's going 
 Talking lots of shit a little tweaking on the weekend 
 I've got to get him by the reigns because I know that I'm freaking 
 Well, I'm a funky skull and I'm a scorpio 
 And when I get my flow I'm dr on the go 
 So q-tip, what you on the mic for 
 Because I had to talk about the times that I rhyme 
 And when m.c.s come in my face, I'm like mace 
 Because I back them off with the quills 
 Nigger 'cause I tell you, nigger 'cause I'll keep you under prills 
 Resting on nine one one sixteenth ave off the Farmes boulevard 
 I'm from Manhattan m.c.a.'s from Brooklyn 
 Yeah, m.c.a., your shit be cooking 
 Praying mantis on the court and I can't be beat 
 So, yo tip, what's up with the boot on your feet 
 I've got the timbos on the toes and this is how it goes 
 Oh one two, oh my god 
 One two, oh my god, I've got some shit 
 I've got the kung fu grip behind my green trap kit 
 Never ever ever smoking crack 
 Never ever ever fucking wack 
 I eat the fuckin' pineapple now & laters 
 Listen to me now, don't listen to me later 
 Fuck it 'cause I know I didn't make it fuckin' rhyme for real 
 But, yo technically I'm as hard as steel 
 Gonna get it together, watch it, gonna get it together ma bell 
 I'm like ma bell, I've got the ill communications
