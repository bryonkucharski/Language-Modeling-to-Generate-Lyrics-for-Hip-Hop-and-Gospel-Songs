Are you runnin' late? 
 Did you show 'em love? 
 Even if you didn't there will never be another 
 Like you 
 Did you write the hit? 
 Did you hit the bong? 
 Even if you did it wit your friend under covers 
 It's you 
 Maybe it was on a strong run 
 Either way actin' like get it done 
 For the lovin' it was all one 
 Cause girl you know it takes one to know one but 
 Do, Do you, dig you? 
 Do, Do you, dig you? 
 Did you drink the drink? 
 Talkin' up the sun? 
 Fightin' off the dragon when it's lookin' in the mirror 
 At you 
 Workin' all day 
 Playin' all night 
 All I wanna do it just get a little hit up 
 To you 
 It's you 
 Do you dig you?
