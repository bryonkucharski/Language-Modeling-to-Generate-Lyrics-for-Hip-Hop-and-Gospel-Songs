Un, deux, trois 
 Bang, bang, bang 
 Feathers, I'm plucking feathers 
 One by one, by one 
 No more skylarking, around my head 
 Your information 
 But there's no hiding, behind moulting feathers 
 On the plane, on my brain, 'bout to do the sho' 
 40k contract, take it out the do' 
 Dice, symbolize my life, roll 'em on the flo' 
 From your grubby hands, as you hand the grandstand 
 You live a shitty life, we live a bon, bon vie 
 Hotter than the book, while we watch the tv 
 Think you got us fooled, ooh never again 
 First time, shame on me, second time, your time will end 
 No way, bang your dead, here's your silhouette 
 Je te plumerai la, tete 
 Je te plumerai la, tete 
 Bang your dead, alouette, here's your silhouette 
 Je te plumerai la, tete 
 Je te plumerai la, tete 
 No way, no, (the clock) it's ticking forward 
 No way, it's just a cruel, cruel world 
 Cruel world is fittin', they got us all hittin' 
 With late night divisions, and lab app decisions 
 But based with decisions, to fight a fricassee 
 And you've clearly decided, on how to handle me 
 Difficile, imbecile, is it fake, is it real 
 Are we dying on our feet, are we trying in our sleep 
 There's a rumour goin' 'round, 'bout the suits runnin' town 
 If you look into the sky, them birds fly high, high, high 
 Numbers, you got that number 
 You're looking outwards, and don't see the big picture 
 Over your shoulder, you'll get no last words 
 Because it's too late, you've clipped your own wings (your own wings) 
 No way, bang your dead, here's your silhouette 
 Je te plumerai la, tete 
 Je te plumerai la, tete 
 Bang your dead, alouette, here's your silhouette 
 Je te plumerai la, tete 
 Je te plumerai la, tete 
 We're never gonna, believe in, the stories, that you're weavin' 
 We're never gonna, believe in, the stories, that you're weavin' 
 We're never gonna, believe in, the stories, that you're weavin' 
 We're believin' in the proof, we're believin' in the truth 
 We're believin' in each other, not you, you, you 
 Stories (you with the tall tales), how many stories (so many tall tales) 
 We climb the structure (you scale the ladder) 
 You build it higher (you make us madder) 
 We take our aim (so now we're bearin' off) 
 You perch above your nest (in your charms) 
 The stories in your head (it's a crazy bald head) 
 That's what got you dead 
 No way, bang your dead, here's your silhouette 
 Je te plumerai la, tete 
 Je te plumerai la, tete 
 Bang your dead, alouette, here's your silhouette 
 Je te plumerai la, tete 
 Je te plumerai la, tete 
 Un, deux, trois 
 No one ever does it like that anymore 
 Bang, bang, bang 
 When feathers fly, you deny everything (alouette)
