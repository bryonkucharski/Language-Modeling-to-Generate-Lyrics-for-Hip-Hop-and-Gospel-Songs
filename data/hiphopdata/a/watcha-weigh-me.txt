 (What you weigh me) 
 Suave House East Coast 
 (We must go)

 Seal 'em off the one who doubts the A+ now where yo nuts at 
 Let 'em fall the basketball I'm asking y'all 
 Naw fuck it I'm telling right at the door 
 We gone meet in the park for the six million pimps march 
 We spark brain sticky (I'm controllin' the top nines) 
 Connected with real pimping my niggas done popped wine 
 Tell ya broad to stop look at me close 
 'Cause I ain't saving 
 The way a chick could come with that shit can be amazing 
 (Act bad) fuckin' with your mind 
 (A million ways for me to act bad) Only need one to get the job done 
 False niggas step in my path what I'ma do 
 I'ma cut the sheepskin off of the wolf reveal the truth 
 Ain't no use in helping no good niggas 'cause they betray you 
 Frost eyes strapped with a sword ready to slay you 
 I'ma lay you down busta you can't replace me 
 I got your daddy feeling like a woman now what you weigh me 
 They say life is a bitch shit 
 So is death 
 Until die and then came to life again ask yourself 
 Is you frontin' for your manhood from the go 
 Or are you fronting for a certain section or a certain ho 
 I intend to take no mo 
 No blows 
 Knock 'em out opposite of No-Doze 
 Say plus never can us never can say we 
 Love ho's go to pay me now what you weigh me 
 Who in the fuck is this? (MJG) I'm in yo shit 
 Leave yo door locked down (my fault) I'm in yo bitch 
 See you told me in the beginning she had a large heart 
 Hell but I didn't know she had large lips and down the part 
 And good throat too (deep as the ocean) now I can see how she provoke you 
 Man she can swallow some shit any other bitch would choke to 
 She got you outta yo mind from flattery took yo paycheck 
 Promised to be down and you ain't never seen that day yet 
 You fuckin' with niggas that who coast ho's 
 Pointin' fingers and slick tricks and broke ho's 
 I dispose of those 
 We broke toes they can't stand on they own ten 
 We don't fold the competition gets blown in 
 I'm known in and out of state 
 Bitches come a dime a dozen no niggas get outta place 
 I relate to all the true ass sistas who truly play me 
 Ho's you passed you gone in yo heart now what you weigh me 
 You can't stop a young entre-pre-nuer doer 
 Bitch as soon as you can take the tour 
 She's easy dog wanna make it with me splurge life 
 The chick would kill for me 
 Just to be my third wife in my third life 
 She's a passed around phony hand me down ass ho 
 And when niggas think they know everything you don't know 
 Jack sh (nah) two cent trick you need a fix 
 You got the Jones 
 Call that broad and pay to keep the lights on 
 The good life living like you was raised 
 You coming with that check well pimpinery gets paid 
 And ain't no minuses 
 It only be pluses when I'm involved 
 And any funny business go down it get resolved 
 'Cause I ain't got to be taking a chance 
 Playing my life just like a lottery 
 Shaking my hand 
 But still you wanna put a stop to me 
 Say you wanna get on down 
 Well OK we stumble and fumble now what you weigh me 
 (Scratches) 
 (Be careful)
