Feat. Canibus, Mr. Cheeks) 
 (Mr. Cheeks) 
 Basically, LB Fam to the motherfuckin death 
 Park side, Queen's niggaz represent 
 Long Isle, how we do? They new our style 
 Represent niggaz in and out the P now 
 Yo, I could do this mother shit for a while 
 I don't give a fuck, my rap style be true yo 
 Yo, eh yo, yo, yo, how we do this 
 Hey yo well back on my South Side, Jamaica part of town 
 Where us real niggas love to get down 
 Where you only hear G and P finessin tracks up on the tape 
 We stuck in Queens and I'm not tryin' to escape 
 Yo I'm havin' cess', drinkin', I'm kickin raps and Emceein 
 LB for life, kid my way of bein 
 Its time to, set up shops, wild in this game and got props 
 And fuck cops, we puffin lah wit windows up in drop tops 
 Nothin' stops my crew from gettin' it we learn from the past 
 Puffin on this ounce of weed, I got this drink in my glass 
 Conversatin with myself, what does my future hold? 
 Niggaz is dyin', will I make it past 30 years old? 
 I can't run, I guess I gots to hold it down till I'm done 
 What the fuck's the deal? I been doin' this here from day one 
 Official Queen's nigga, be a Lost Boy till my death 
 Until I breathe my mothafuckin last breath 
 (Chorus: Mr. Cheeks x2) 
 Eh yo from boyz to men 
 We're strictly Fam, no longer friends 
 Lets keep it thorough, I hold it down till its on again 
 Until we meet again, yo I'm back up on the street again 
 I'm tryin' to make it, throw out my nine but pack the heat again 
 (A+) 
 Check this out 
 Yo, yo 
 My mind is reachin' twice that size than it only did last year 
 Three times its likely to feel clear 
 A+, I transform into a super emcee 
 With super vocals quicker than Superman can find a phone booth 
 The whole truth nothin' but the whole truth, I roast you 
 Thermonuclear vocals get hotter that in Shanobal 
 The double O, just abide nuclear explosions 
 Exposin radiation like a vulcan 
 I'm the only guy that knows why the golden eye 
 Was stolen by five soviet spies 
 They told me to lie, they don't want to hear the god spit 
 Chop my hands off at the armpits but I regenerate limbs 
 Like Star fish, comin' at you with the hard shit 
 Swallow my beeper and page myself so I can communicate with a dolphin 
 Lyrical arson rush the planet like a million martians committin arson 
 Walkin' the tarpits in India with snake charmers that place all the weight 
 Down... 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo A+ fuck the nonsense 
 I got the reinforcements 
 To crush any enemies offense with a hundred thousand Horsemen 
 And the hardest muthafucka on the market right here 
 I'll complete in a minute what would take you a light year 
 Extra-terrestrial biological entities with infinite energy 
 Battling for world supremecy 
 Who wanna get touched 
 The CAN-I-BUS will crush you 
 With hard jigsaw puzzles and strong jaw muscles 
 Ambushin emcees jumpin' out the trees 
 Like Vietnamese in fatigues covered with leaves 
 Interrogatin you wack emcees like MIB's with dark glasses 
 Askin you to tell me exactly where that alien craft landed 
 By flashing bright light in your eyes with those silver gamas 
 So when you revive you can't recall or understand it 
 That's how the Canibus keeps tabs on the planet 
 I use amnesia to neutralize public panic 
 And take advantage of oppurtinites to do damage 
 I pierce your heart with evil thoughts 
 The only thing faster then tha speed of light is the speed of dark 
 With the jaws of a great white shark I rip you apart 
 My state-of-the art lyrical lasers is razor sharp 
 Splatter the brain matter of my enemies 
 With the same bullet trajectory that murdered John Kennedy 
 In the back of his cranial cavity which is actually 
 What happens to any motherfucker for tryin' to battle me
