 (Yo, how we livin'?) 
 This is New York City 
 Ninety-seven Sosa 
 A to Z up in the spot representin? 
 Takin' it back from here it's ?sposed to be 
 Takin' ya back, son, take it back 
 Check it 
 Six digit trickin? Coke and Henny mixin?, many listen 
 Fuckin' give me mine, don't wanna see no penny missin' 
 It's old tradition how we click and fall in position 
 The rap coalition, we gettin' rich an 
 Poetically I'm deadly like a crucifixion 
 Buddha addiction 
 Dismissin' competition when they roll wit friction 
 My whole crew be schemin? flippy 
 Like ixing for that chicken 
 Smith brothas and A on ya Mason-Dixon 
 Who want the steel cap, feel the real rap 
 Patiently my whole crew waited and we rock premeditated 
 Chucked underground like the rap genie 
 And watch the shore by the rising tide 
 Now the whole world can see me 
 When they get foul that's when my style gets wild 
 I hang a man in front of a crowd without a trial 
 Kapow, yo that's all she wrote, end the quote 
 For frontin', a brotha got a dome and his legs broke

 Yeah son, I want it all, your crib, cars and beepers 
 Wit hundred dollar sneakers my sounds blowin' ya speakers 
 Burgundy Landcruisers, chrome rims on blue Rugers 
 Lyrical hollow tip, slug point trugers 
 Yo, yo, yo, drug connects 
 Diamond cut bergets drippin' wet 
 My hole is there from Quebec, got her flippin? checks 
 What? I push a black Lex with gold on my neck 
 You rockin' wit a vest tryin' to catch a hole in ya chest 
 Firm official, exotic girl but wanna be the ritual 
 Leavin' lights shine light, they've been psyched to slip through 
 I will abolish MC?s, get straight up demolished 
 Yo, my mind is like a nine, I load it up wit knowledge

 The realism must continue, where I live is like a battlefield 
 We all poor but on my block is like a half a mil 
 Surrounded by the most criminal type of elements 
 Blunts, stunts, gunshots, broken-down developments 
 It's all illegal, young juveniles wit the Desert Eagles 
 Street sweepers, heaters, soon-to-be retreater 
 It's routine, people seem to go through a cycle 
 So confused, to choose between the Bible or the rifle 
 Watch 'em stifle 
 Yo, me an son gon? escalate this 
 And get these papers run some capers 
 While they catch the vapors 
 Yeah, son, don't got no time for no chicken trickin? 
 It's the lyrical addiction 'cause me an? AZ be politicin?
