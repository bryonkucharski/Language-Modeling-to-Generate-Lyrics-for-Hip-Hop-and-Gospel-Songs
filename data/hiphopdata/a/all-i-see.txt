Boy, all I see, is you and me 
 And all I do, is think of you 
 Yo, I remember when we met the whole scene was set 
 Backstage rockin' black shades 
 Told you not to be afraid 
 We touched and when your smile turned to a blush 
 (Incomprehensible) 
 I had to get to know your name 
 Then I got your number 
 17 and under, maybe just a little younger 
 Had to get to know you, 'cause there's things I wanna show you 
 Forget them other brothers they know lines that they told you 
 Now your acting all shy, hmm I wonder why 
 Everytime I looked at you, you turned and drop your eye 
 We faced, began to lace you up with lines 
 Fragrance by Ann Klein had me losing my mind 
 With your zodiac sign, my perfect match, in fact 
 I'm compatible with anything from Mio to Ash 
 Now it's all about us we're hooked like drugs 
 I'm on my way to being a thug, show me love 
 Boy all I see, is you and me 
 And all I do is, think of you 
 Give me the chance to know your name 
 I'll never turn and walk away 
 I can't get you out of my mind 
 I'd be lying if I said I wasn't hooked after just one look 
 Yeah see you at the mall with your mom looking all flashy 
 Poppin' out of a taxi, met eues when you passed me 
 Been inside of my head all day, what can I say? 
 All I can do is reminicse like Mary J 
 I want to get with you 
 So come and get with me 
 We'll be K-I-S-S-I-N-G and all that good stuff 
 Calling you bluff, now look at us 
 Just met and already talkin' 'bout trust 
 All the things we did, how we planned to live 
 How you got rid me of that kid, who use to call you crib 
 Shut it down 
 Now look what you found a state of dawn 
 You da bomb, plus you got props from my mom 
 Now it's all about us we're hooked like drugs 
 I'm on my way to being a thug, show me love 
 I can't get you out of my mind 
 Think about you all of the time 
 Wanna get to know you baby, oh 
 I'm glad I made my move 
 I'm glad I stepped to you 
 Enough respect that my whole crew accepted you 
 Even my ex called you 'cause she wasn't insecure 
 Feeling got a little hurt but was being mature 
 Gave her blessings that she learned some valuable lessons 
 Now she use me as her reference 
 She's my best friend 
 Don't even stress, 'cause all I see is you and me 
 Like Latifah you're Queen, let's bring some unity 
 Ain't no reason to fight, you know we're keeping it tight 
 Whether walking or holding hands or sharing seats on the bike 
 Always on my mind with your Gucci design 
 Feel free to drop a line, yeah that would suit me fine 
 It's all about you boo, and all the things you do 
 Making dreams come true, buying rings for two 
 Now it's just be you we're hooked like drugs 
 I'm on my way to being a thug, show me love 
 Boy all I see, is you and me 
 And all I do, is think of you 
 Give me the chance to know your name 
 I'll never turn and walk away 
 Boy all I see, is you and me 
 And all I do, is think of you 
 Give me the chance to know your name 
 I'll never turn and walk away 
 Boy all I see, is you and me 
 And all I do, is think of you 
 Give me the chance to know your name 
 I'll never turn and walk away
