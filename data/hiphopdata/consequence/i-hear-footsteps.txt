This is a warning, that you need to take into 
 Otherwise the consequences that'll leads to 
 Cold sweats that'll feel like a steam room 
 And dark nights that you probably won't sleep through 
 Just when you think you about to call it a night 
 You get a funny feeling that something ain't right 
 Because all the way home with your son and your wife 
 You realize this game have to come with a price 
 So payback's a bitch when you caught in the life 
 And the Lost and the Damned cut you off with the bikes 
 That's how it goes when you caught in the hype 
 And now your worst nightmare's coming to life 
 Because they tip, toe, real, slow 
 And you can hear the screams through your window 
 How they even get up on your whip? Whoa! 
 Until you take it off like a strip show 
 I hear footsteps, coming up the stairs 
 I turn around but no one there 
 I hear footsteps coming up the stairs 
 I turn around but no one there 
 I hear footsteps coming up the stairs 
 I turn around but no one there 
 I hear footsteps coming up the stairs 
 I turn around but no one there 
 Just when you said you quit the game if you could 
 The homies won't holler that you left them for good 
 And you thought it would be calmer in this neck of the woods 
 So if you could get a weapon and some armor you should 
 Because now you got decisions that are hard to avoid 
 The good night sleep that you used to enjoy 
 Has been interrupted by a startle of noise 
 That lurks in the dark and won't respond to your voice 
 Because they tip, toe, real, slow 
 And lift up the screen to your window 
 How they even find out where you live? Whoa! 
 They want the best scheming from the get go 
 Just when you thought you put the past behind you 
 News flash, it's right behind you 
 In a black mask breathing hard to find you 
 And that's when the feelings in your heart to find you 
 Is you going to let them run up in your crib? 
 And put the gun up to your kid? 
 Well if that's the way it is, you can push to the limit 
 Till something's got to give 
 Because they tip, toe, real, slow 
 And lift up the screen to your window 
 Guess who's waiting for them in the crib, whoa! 
 And his trigger finger's about to let the clip go 
 I hear footsteps
