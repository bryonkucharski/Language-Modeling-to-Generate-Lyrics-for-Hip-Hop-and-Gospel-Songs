 Put your flags up in the sky (Put them in the sky) (Jogue lá no alto) 
 And wave them side to side (Side to side) (Lado a lado) 
 Show the world where you're from (Show them where you're from) (We are one, baby) 
 Show the world we are one (One love, life) 
 Ole, ole, ole, ola 
 Ole, ole, ole, ola 
 Ole, ole, ole, ola 
 Ole, ole, ole, ola 
 When the going gets tough 
 The tough get going 
 One love, one life, one world, one fight 
 Whole world, one night, one place, Brazil 
 Everybody put your flags in the sky and do what you feel 
 It's your world, my world, our world today 
 And we invite the whole world, whole world to play 
 It's your world, my world, our world today 
 And we invite the whole world, whole world to play 
 Es mi mundo, tu mundo, el mundo de nosotros 
 Invitamos a todo el mundo a jugar con nosotros 
 Put your flags up in the sky (Put them in the sky) (Jogue lá no alto) 
 And wave them side to side (Side to side) (Lado a lado) 
 Show the world where you're from (Show them where you're from) (We are one, baby) 
 Show the world we are one (One love, life)

 One night, watch the world unite 
 Two sides, one fight, and a million eyes 
 Full heart's gonna work so hard 
 Shoot, fall, the stars 
 Fists raised up towards the sky 
 Tonight watch the world unite, world unite, world unite 
 For the fight, fight, fight, one night 
 Watch the world unite 
 Two sides, one fight and a million eyes 
 Hey, hey, hey, força, força come on sing with me 
 Hey, hey, hey, allez, allez come shout it out with me 
 Hey, hey, hey, come on now 
 Hey, hey, hey, come on now 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

 É meu, é seu 
 Hoje é tudo nosso 
 Quando chega o mundo inteiro pra jogar é pra mostrar que eu posso 
 Torcer, chorar, sorrir, gritar 
 Não importar o resultado, vamos extravasar
