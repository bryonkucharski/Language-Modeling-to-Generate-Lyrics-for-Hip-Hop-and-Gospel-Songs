 That little cuban from Miami, Pitbull! 
 I appreciate y'all giving me the oppurtunity to spit on this shit 
 Go headdddddddd!

 Y'all know we on some halloween shit 
 Start trickin' 'n' treatin' 
 But I'm on some halloween shit too 
 Gettin' messed up for the radication BOOM! 
 From the palm trees to the red clay 
 We get down the same way 
 Lil Jon's from Scott but this little cuban's 
 From the county of Dade 
 Pitbull is here to voice his opinion 
 And y'all gone hear it 
 All up and down the eastside 
 I'm'a show y'all how dirty we ride 
 From Dade to Decatur 
 Only difference is y'all blow dro 
 And we blow crip 
 But reall there's is no differecne 
 'Cause they're both green and sticky 
 I don't mean to be picky 
 But Jon, tell your boys from the Eastside 
 To put me down with one of those 
 Redbone who has a pretty face, n waist 
 And thick thighs 
 From the M-I-A to the A-T-L 
 We been connecting on work 
 But keep that on the DL
