Umm... Umm... Umm... Umm... 
 Anjuli Stars... Pitbull... 
 This is dedicated to anybody that's lost somebody important in their life 
 Don't worry they in a better place now 
 Verse 1 (Anjuli) 
 I fear not what the future holds 
 But more what the future unfolds 
 'Cause I'm dying each time that I breath in life without you 
 Every hour is solemn I need you 
 I'm devoured, I've fallen now what can I do 
 There is so much to give 
 If only I had my hands to fix what you did 
 So I hold it inside, 
 Watch as it dies, 
 I can't even look at the sky, 
 It's burning my eyes, 
 Similar to cigarette smoke, 
 I wish I could float far away from here. 
 Raindrops, I hope one day that this pain stops no, no 
 Raindrops, I hope one day that this pain stops 
 Washing me away 4x 
 Pitbull 
 Still dealing' with the death of my father 
 Still dealing with the death of my best friend 
 Eddie I'm a miss you dog 
 But you know I'm a ride to the end, I love you 
 I ain't cry when you died, but I'm a let my tears fall on the track 
 My brother Uly just came home and it feels good to have him back, welcome home dog 
 See everything happens for a reason, you don't know what you have till it's gone 
 That's why I'm a take advantage of the fact I'm breathing and the words of this song 
 Are dedicated to Eddie and Barilla, but I know in the future I'm a see ya 
 I know you both looking down on me proudly, I know y'all both love me 
 Raindrops, I hope one day that this pain stops no, no 
 Raindrops, I hope one day that this pain stops 
 Washing me away 4x 
 Pitbull 
 See in Life things go wrong, if it don't kill it's only gonna make you strong 
 So you must hold on, If everything was right then there is something wrong 
 Ironic ain't it, that's just the way life is, that's why I thank God any chance that I get for blessing me with beautiful kids 
 What's victory with no loss, what's smiling with no tears, what's love with no hate, what's courage with no fear 
 Just think about it and apply it to your life and no matter what the problem is, don't worry baby, keep your head up it's gonna be all right 
 Raindrops, I hope one day that this pain stops no, no 
 Raindrops, I hope one day that this pain stops 
 Washing me away 4x
