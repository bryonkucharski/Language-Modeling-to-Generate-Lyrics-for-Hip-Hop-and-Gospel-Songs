That is of course 
 If you want some of this Candyman 
 Just stand in front of the mirror 
 Say "Candyman" three times 
 Baby, just call me 
 (Candyman) 
 You know they call me 
 (Candyman) 
 That's right they call me 
 (Candyman) 
 Every city, every state, every country 
 Mami I'm known as 
 (Candyman) 
 Baby just call me 
 (Candyman) 
 When ya want some of this 
 (Candyman) 
 Say name in the mirror 
 Three times baby, just call me 
 I don't think that you're ready for the bang bang 
 When I bump in the guts 
 I be tearin' it up doin' my thang thang 
 Hey, hey, hey little mama 
 I'd love to see that ass 
 In Victoria's Secret pajamas 
 Yes, yes, yes 
 I'm a freak freak that eats 
 Eats pussy like Jeffrey Dahmer 
 Ay mi madre, gimme a night 
 And I promise I'll change ya life 
 But remember, baby girl that you're not my wife 
 Other then that I don't give a fuck 
 Let's keep in touch 
 Baby, just call me 
 (Candyman) 
 You know they call me 
 (Candyman) 
 That's right they call me 
 (Candyman) 
 Every city, every state, every country 
 Mami I'm known as 
 (Candyman) 
 Baby just call me 
 (Candyman) 
 When ya want some of this 
 (Candyman) 
 Say name in the mirror 
 Three times baby, just call me
