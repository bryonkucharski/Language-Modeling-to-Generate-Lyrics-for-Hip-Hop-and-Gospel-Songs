Being overlooked, being slept on 
 Being started but I just keep going 
 Being up, being down 
 Payed dues, earned stripes 
 Been in lawsuits, welcome to my life 
 I'm too Latin for hip hop 
 And too hip hop for Latin 
 So you all figure it out I'ma keep rappin' 
 But that's okay 
 'Cause I'ma be on the top one day 
 Con pasiensia y vaselina 
 El elefante se la metio a la ormiga 
 And that's the slogan I live by 
 Me, I just hang in the hood 
 Y'all just drive by 
 Lights out, lights out like a drive by 
 My life is real 
 I ain't got nothing to lie about 
 You can ask anyone that's with me 
 How this lil' chico right here 
 Took over the city 
 Luke, trick they were the start 
 But that lil' chico Pitbull, he was the spot 
 Now this nigga's picking up rappers 
 Like they know what's up 
 Two at a time, nigga 
 Who would have thought 
 The bottom on top 
 Today's lil rappers not to take it to heart 
 If you can't finish don't start 
 Hey, if you can't finish don't start 
 Hey, if you can't finish don't start, rah
