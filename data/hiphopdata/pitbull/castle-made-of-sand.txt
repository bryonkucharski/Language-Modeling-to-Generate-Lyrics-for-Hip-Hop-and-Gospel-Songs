 So you tried, to believe in the castle made of sand 
 When it falls to the sea and your feet can't find dry land 
 Reach for my hand.

 I sacrifice my life to give you my life through speakers, 
 Try to do good even though I've been crossed like Jesus, 
 God knows I got a good heart but my blood is filled with demons 
 I'm fighting myself, believe me, 
 I'm far from ignorant, Far from greedy 
 If you know what I come from, knew what I've been through 
 You think there should been another outcome 
 Just like most kids, a father I did it without one 
 Come from the city where they'll x you like Malcolm 
 Then you wonder how come 
 I can move in the room full of wolves so swift so smooth, 
 Thank you mom for making me a man 
 Let a motherfucker knock down my castle made of sand

 Pitbull 
 I lived my whole life with the world on my shoulders, 
 So I could care less what this music game throw us, 
 I see them looking for them keys but they won't find it, 
 I come from struggle, I'm a fighter' must you be reminded, 
 My mothers past has her trapped, has her blinded, 
 But I took her past, I took her pain, I made it strength, I fought the game 
 Do or die, Pitbull's the name. 
 Now all I see is the future, 
 Mom I love you, I salute you 
 And no matter what happens just know you're the reason that I'm rappin'.

 Look 
 I'm from the home of the spitters, the winners, the big apple 
 Came down to south beach to build a new castle 
 Every day I'm hustling and every day you hassle, 
 Doing what you can and I'm doing what I have to, 
 Throw me in the jungle and I'll show you I'm a winner, 
 I'm coming out with dinner and wearing a chinchilla, 
 I did it for my town to show 'em the big picture, 
 Pit hit the switch, I promise to never switch up, 
 This is for my brother took three and went to jail, 
 I'm send all the pictures of my shows through the mail 
 He hit me with a letter, said: I know you'll never fail, 
 So put me on a beach with a bucket and a pale
