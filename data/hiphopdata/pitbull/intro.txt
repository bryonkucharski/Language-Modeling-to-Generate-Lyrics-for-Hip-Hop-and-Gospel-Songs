Yeah niggas, Welcome to Dade County 
 Where we slang rocks that claim blocks 
 And those red and blue lights just keep our streets hot 
 C'mon and ride with a nigga so I can show you what Dade County really got 
 See don't be fooled by South Beach 
 Thinking when you come to the Bottom you can just run these streets 
 You and your jewels are like a menu 
 And trust me nigga we intend to eat 
 Fuck around and cross that I-395 
 You just run into a bunch of dead end streets 
 Niggas with wifebeaters and bare feet 
 That's right, I'm talking straight goon style 
 Go beyond that about 3 miles and you're now entering the infamous Lil Havana 
 Now I know y'all studio gangsters be vibing off the movie "Scarface" 
 But the wrong move in this place, you'll fuck around and meet the real Tony Montana 
 So fuck them palm trees 
 I got shit for you to really see 
 Like there's a graveyard with bury sub with niggas buried 4 generations deep 
 And I ain't even talking about sister lined next to brother 
 I'm talking granddaddy to grandmother piled up on top of each other 
 And all that rap about you're Lil Haiti connections? 
 Nigga you don't even know a real zo 
 But I can introduce you to one that'll kick in your door 
 Put you faced down on the floor 
 And have your whole family wiring money from Chicago 
 But you a star, though 
 Okay, nigga if you a real G 
 This is where you tell your car to go 
 Opa Locka 
 Where there is continuous spotlight helicopters and a triangle full of choppers 
 Carol City will make holes in you so big, they can't be plugged by doctors 
 Nigga, this is the real Dade County 
 Where we are soldiers from birth to the hurst 
 That's why my childhood consisted of a bulletproof vest and a pyrex 
 Nigga, you haven't even seen the real Miami, yet 
 So Welcome to Miami-Dade County, the real Miami 
 Where we live and die, for life
