I'm falling in love with party, friends and alcohol 
 I'm falling in love with party, friends and alcohol 
 We falling in love with party, friends and alcohol 
 That's why I'm falling in love I'm falling in love 
 With you tonight 
 Spent my whole life waiting for a girl like you 
 Baby tell me what I got to do 
 We can leave this party, back to my room 
 You could show me a thing or two 
 'Cause I been spending all my money 
 On these pretty girls and alcohol 
 But honey they ain't got a thing on you 
 You shook me once, you shook me twice 
 Now take me to your paradise 
 You know there's just one thing left to 
 Let me show you I'm talking about 
 If you let me be your lover 
 I'd do anything for you 
 I could rock you like no other 
 Oh oh come on girl get loose 
 Baby shake that body, now turn around 
 Slow motion for me now (oh yeah) 
 Girl you got me going, now I'm going down 
 Yeah you know what I talking about 
 'Cause I been spending all my money 
 On these pretty girls and alcohol 
 But honey they ain't got a thing on you 
 You shook me once, you shook me twice 
 Now take me to your paradise 
 You know there's just one thing left to 
 Let me show you I'm talking about 
 If you let me be your lover 
 I'd do anything for you 
 I could rock you like no other 
 Oh oh come on girl get loose 
 I'm the mailman I deliver 
 Take her to dinner 
 Conversate a little then I split her down the middle like Miam's river 
 I like my women one up one down Kerry Kittles 
 Here's a riddle 
 What's the opposite of walk ? run 
 What's the opposite of go ? come 
 That means I hit it, you come 
 Fe fi fo fun, tear the club up! 
 All my sexy ladies that came to lose their minds 
 Put you hands up high tear the club up! 
 She ain't looking for me, she just looking for a really good time 
 That's right! tear the club up! 
 Let's drink that bottle and forget what we doing tonight 
 Tear the club up! 
 I ain't trying to be your lover for life just your lover tonight 
 That's right 
 If you let me be your lover 
 I'd do anything for you 
 I could rock you like no other 
 Oh oh come on girl get loose 
 If you let me be your lover 
 I'd do anything for you 
 I could rock you like no other 
 Oh oh come on girl get loose
