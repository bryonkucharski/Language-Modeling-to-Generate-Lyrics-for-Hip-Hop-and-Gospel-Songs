It's that little Chico Pitbull 
 This my way of letting my City know 
 I'll ride for 'em! I'll Cry for 'em! 
 Bust five for 'em! And most of all, 
 Fucking die for 'em! 
 (Repeat 4x) 
 Hey 305! till I die! 
 (Chorus Repeat 2x) 
 I'll ride for my muthafucing click! For my click! 
 I'll die for my muthafucking click! For my click! 
 I bust heads with my muthafucking click! With my click! 
 If a nigga talk shit, Watch my shit go click! 
 Click, click, click, click! 
 Man, I've been on the grind, 
 1 in the head, 16 in the 9 
 I'm extra Man! 
 The game is mine, in due time 
 It's all right, I'm patient Man! 
 I know how to play my position 
 I know how to play my part 
 I know how to play these bitches 
 I know how to play with they hearts 
 I've done some dumb things 
 But for the most, 
 I've played it smart 
 Who cares if you run things 
 'Cause I'm as live as 106 and park! 
 This game is nothing, 
 But a pool of blood with a bunch of sharks! 
 Only the strong survive 
 It's Do or Die get it Right! 
 That's why I roll for my peoples 
 Cock back, go to war with my peoples 
 Break bread with my peoples 
 Man I'll die for my peoples 
 Everybody knows it's the truth 
 That's why they respect everything that I do 
 Everywhere that I go, every fiend, every foe 
 Every bitch or a hoe 
 Man I sold it all 
 From the weed to the x 
 From the x to the blow 
 Mark my words "I'm next to blow!" 
 P to the I, I to the T, T to the B, B to the U, to the double the L 
 Me I'ma sell like ice cream in hell 
 This for my peoples that's locked up in jail 
 I'ma succeed, I'm never 'gon fail! 
 Papo just watch me! 
 Man I'm watching the game closely 
 Uncle Luke that man done coached me 
 He told me the who, what, where's, and why's 
 How to cross T's, how to dot I's 
 Little did he know he created a Monster 
 PITBULL Nigga, I'm that Monster 
 DB, them Chico's is Monsters! 
 Lil'Jon, that Nigga is a Monster 
 Everybody in the clique is well equipped 
 Ready for Pit to take over shit 
 This here is not a game 
 This here is our lives 
 We can't fuck this up 
 We gotta get it right 
 If you wit us and you ready for war 
 Then let's Ride! 
 LET'S show 'em how we do in the south 
 Kick in they door, run in they house 
 Since them boys think they spit fire 
 Fuck it, put the gun in they mouth! 
 Follow me now 
 All these bitches wanna swallow me now 
 All these niggas that I don't even know 
 Wanna hollah at me now 'cause the wanna be down 
 But fuck'em man 
 Me I turn it up a notch 
 To my hustlers be careful when they murdering the block 
 To my killers be careful when you burning up the glock 
 Last thing you wanna be is running from the cops 
 Pit's 'gon take it from da bottom to the top 
 Haters can hate, but it ain't 'gon stop 
 Everybody knows I'mma blow just listen to the flow 
 This Chico got it on lock HA 
 (Repeat 12x) 
 Hey 305! till I die!
