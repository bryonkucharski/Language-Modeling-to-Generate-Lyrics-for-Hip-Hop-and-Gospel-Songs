Its Pitbull, Lil Jon 
 It's my way of paying you back dog 
 For all the love that you gave me 
 (Pitbull) 
 I'll be more than happy 
 To show you how I rap 
 Who I am, where I'm from 
 And what's coming up next 
 Fuck the glitter and gold 
 And all the glamour and glits 
 I'm here for 1 reason 
 And survey says! To get rich 
 So give me the loot (loot) 
 Show me the cash 
 Open the safe 
 Show me the stash 
 I suggest that you show ?? Operation 
 Or end up in the hospital 
 Getting emergency operations 
 Family asking doctor doctor 
 Will he make it through 
 But there's nothing that doctor doctor can do 
 When the chi-chi-chi-choppers 
 Are chi-chi-chi-chopping at you 
 That's it, your done 
 Your finished, your through 
 There's no coming back 
 What you think were cooking crack 
 Just one question dog 
 What the fuck are you looking at 
 I know its hard 
 Its hard to understand 
 But Pitbull will serve you anyway 
 Even underhand 
 Don't fuck around 
 Because you just might end up 
 Under land 
 I'm not the coward motherfucka 
 I'm the man 
 I'm the killer on tracks 
 Call me the son of sam 
 I don't know if y'all ready 
 But bet ya ass I am 
 (Lil Jon) 
 Who run this shit! 
 Bitch we run this shit! (What!)
