(Pitbull:) 
 I know you Full Of Shit 
 Your so Full Of Shit. (x8) 
 Believe none of what you hear 
 And only half of what you see 
 Believe none of what you hear 
 And only half what you see 
 Believe none of what you hear 
 And only half of what you see 
 Let me tell you what I think about there boys out here in the state they call the game 
 Believe nothing of what you hear and only half of what you see. 
 I'm sick of these rappers slash actors pl-pl-pl playing a part 
 All they talk about is they money, je-je-je-jewels and cars. 
 So put pha pha phatoms and bentleys 
 And how they squeeze till its empty 
 How they move yay hooray 
 Another doe boy wannabe 
 All in the club talkin' back 
 Wha wha what what they got 
 Pull out the club on 26's 
 Go str straight to they mama's house 
 Like southern cali they hardly make it rain or drizzle 
 That's why I do them so opposite of these nizzle for shizzles. 
 Uh tell um. 
 Your so Full Of Shit. (x8) 
 Believe nothing of what your hear 
 And only half of what you see. (x4) 
 The boy know his alaphabet, so now he think he a G 
 Run a little Pac so he think he a thug 
 Bu bu but all eyes on me 
 They used to wanna be like mike 
 Now they just want a piece of the mic 
 They cut fucked-up deals in music 
 Imagine they got 25 to life. 
 They'll be singing like whitney 
 Before before she met bobby 
 These boys think think they hard 
 Knowin' they green like wasabi 
 They'll be singing like whitney 
 Before before she met bobby 
 These boys think think they hard 
 Knowing they green like wasabi. 
 Now tell um. 
 Your so Full Of Shit. (x8) 
 Believe nothing of what you hear 
 And only half of what you see. (x4) 
 Your heard me. 
 These boys right now they got a house full of cars 
 A bank account full of money 
 They act like they on full 
 But check this out fool 
 I know your Full Of Shit. 
 Your so Full Of Shit. (x8) 
 Believe nothing of what you hear 
 And only half of what you see. (x4)
