We gonna rock the boat, rock it till it breaks down 
 Rock the boat, hop it till it can't be found 
 Rock the boat, break it to the underground 
 Tonight I'm thirsty and I'm drinking like a grizzly bear 
 'Cause I'm on fire like a chilli super? 
 I got a lighting ball on my hair, let's party? 
 We're gonna rock the boat, rock it till it breaks down 
 Rock the boat, hop it till it can't be found 
 Keep on rockin' we ain't stopping 
 Rockin' rockin', keep on hoppin' 
 Rock the boat, bring it to the underground 
 Now go, ? the world wide down marvelous 
 I'm so hot, I'm hotter than lava is 
 I don't know what you're thinkin' but I hope you're thinkin' what I'm thinkin' 
 ? Don't ? my witness, and I treat sex like it's psychical fitness 
 Up and down let the ? now baby let me give you the business 
 First trip baby you gonna see you be riding with me 
 Second trip, baby you gonna see you be rollin' with me 
 Third trip, baby you gonna see you be rockin' with me 
 Forth trip, you gonna be rockin' alone with me 
 We're gonna rock the boat, rock it till it breaks down 
 Rock the boat, hop it till it can't be found 
 Keep on rockin' we ain't stopping 
 Rockin' rockin', keep on hoppin' 
 Rock the boat, ?rockin', keep them rock the boat 
 Rock it till it breaks down 
 Rock the boat, hop it till it can't be found 
 Keep on rockin' we ain't stopping 
 Rockin' rockin', keep on hoppin' 
 Rock the boat, bring it to the underground 
 We're gonna rock the boat, rock the boat 
 We're gonna rock the boat, rock the boat 
 We're gonna rock the boat, rock it till it breaks down 
 Rock the boat, hop it till it can't be found 
 Rock the boat, rock it till it breaks down 
 Rock the boat, bring it to the underground.
