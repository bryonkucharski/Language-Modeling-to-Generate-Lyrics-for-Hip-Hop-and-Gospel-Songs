To all the DJ's out there I appreciate the love 
 Let's show 'em why Pitbull one of the rawest (Mr. 305) 
 I'm one of the best, one of the rawest 
 Nah I ain't perfect but bitch I'm flawless 
 Nah I ain't stupid but the flow is retarded 
 Barely made high school, the streets was my college 
 Rappin' here for years, workin and grindin 
 On the streets if you copped it, I supplied it 
 I've worked everything, every drug you name it 
 I've seen families get tied up for missin' payments 
 Keep thinking that this thing is just entertainment 
 Disrepect, get introduced to the pavement 
 Catch me somewhere on the islands of Caymen 
 Me, I see the future, y'all boys cavemen 
 Now it's cartoons and TV shows 
 First album gold, remix did fo, El Mariel in stores 
 I hustle (I hustle), I grind (I grind), 
 That's why they call me Mr. 305
