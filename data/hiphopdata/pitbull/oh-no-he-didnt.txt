Mr. Perez 
 Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth 
 And nothin' but the truth, so help you God? 
 Fuck you, honor 
 Pit is back for another one 
 This time he's back harder, stronger, and, and 
 And a little more troublesome 
 Double the guns, guns 
 Double the funds, funds 
 Double the bitches, bitches 
 Double the fun, fun 
 We can take it to the north, then bring it to the south, the dirty, dirty 
 Where they got them choppers, choppers and them 30, 30's 
 You can be a hell of an elephant, nigga 
 You ain't gotta be intelligent to see that's irrelevant, nigga 
 Size and shit when they firing clips 
 You ain't a thug or a gangsta, stop lyin' you bitch 
 I see you study 2Pac like a history lesson 
 His murder was a mystery that made history bridgin' but 
 No matter how much juice he had, when it came to the law 
 He got no poetic justice, that's the truth dawg 
 The what? That's the truth dawg 
 Truth hurts, but, but, but that's the truth dawg 
 Oh, oh no he didn't 
 Oh, oh yes he did 
 Oh, oh no he didn't 
 Yes he did, yes he did 
 Oh, oh no he didn't 
 Oh, oh yes he did 
 Oh, oh no he didn't 
 Yes he did, yes he did 
 Oh, oh no I didn't 
 Oh, oh yes I did 
 C-U-B-O gonna rip it up 
 Y'all don't want that extra clip 
 I'm from Miami, man, pretty some y'all understand 
 Understand I'm the man, move them thangs hand to hand 
 I open shop, shop, takeover yo block, block 
 Pull up on that thang slow, everybody stop, stop 
 I'm a stunna, baby 
 Hustla, baby get it, baby take it, baby 
 Drive 'em crazy 
 Now really, have you see me lately? 
 There he comes, there he goes 
 Where he flows, people know 
 He gon' blow 
 He been talking get, get, get, get that dough 
 Y'all hear that blocka, blocka 
 So call the doctor, doctor 
 I deal what I deal 
 When the bottom talk, the choppers chopper 
 So get ready for Cubo, 'cause they say he gon' blow 
 Get, get ready for what? Get ready for Cubo 
 So get ready for Cubo, 'cause they say he gon' blow 
 Get, get ready for what? Get ready for Cubo 
 Oh, oh no he didn't 
 Oh, oh yes he did 
 Oh, oh no he didn't 
 Yes he did, yes he did 
 Oh, oh no he didn't 
 Oh, oh yes he did 
 Oh, oh no he didn't 
 Yes he did, yes he did 
 Verse two, don't make me flip out, turn around and hurt you 
 I ain't the violent type, I'm a nice guy 
 Light skin, light eyes 
 Who dreamed of a totally, totally different type of American sliced pie 
 Two point one seven eight, exact weight 
 If it's that raw like the south, here to turn base 
 If ya smart when you see that murder, turn yo' face 
 Fuck DNA bitch, nigga we'll burn the place 
 If ya don't see me at the crib 
 Mean I'm on the road, puttin' food on the table for my kids 
 All my hungry hustlas made it stick to your ribs 
 Ain't too many hustlas that can do what I did 
 I stay on my grizzle fo' shizzle, fo' shizzle 
 Thanks to my nizzle little jizzle, I'm off them hizzle fo' shizzle 
 The what? That's the truth dawg 
 Truth hurts, but, but, but that's the truth dawg 
 Oh, oh no he didn't 
 Oh, oh yes he did 
 Oh, oh no he didn't 
 Yes he did, yes he did 
 Oh, oh no he didn't 
 Oh, oh yes he did 
 Oh, oh no he didn't 
 Yes he did, yes he did
