 Baby I'm a love you down 
 This is not a drill 
 This is not a false alarm 
 This shit is for real 
 Baby I'm a love you down 
 I-I-I don't wanna waste your time 
 Big girls don't cry wolf when they cry 
 Someone's gonna fall in love tonight 
 Yeah we might fall in love tonight 
 I-I-I don't wanna waste your time 
 Pretty girls always tell pretty lies 
 Someone's gonna fall in love tonight 
 This is not a drill 
 This is not a drill 
 This is not a drill, this is not a drill 
 This is not a false alarm 
 I got that sweet D, mami got that sweet pea 
 When I get her, all she says is "ay papi, si, si" 
 She give me that Road Runner, long neck, beep, beep 
 And her tongue do a little more than just French kiss, wei-wei 
 I'm talking them big numbers, Microsoft and DC's 
 Bring a friend and a friend, Chicago Bulls, 3-Peat 
 Mami got them looks that kill, yeah, she's real 
 Take it all off, keep them heels, this is not a drill 
 I-I-I don't wanna waste your time 
 Big girls don't cry wolf when they cry 
 Someone's gonna fall in love tonight 
 Yeah we might fall in love tonight 
 I-I-I don't wanna waste your time 
 Pretty girls always tell pretty lies 
 Someone's gonna fall in love tonight 
 Mami got that top off, mami got that low ride 
 Mami got that big trunk, wet paint, that right 
 Mami got that get down, she got that lock jaw 
 She got that slip, she got that slide, that Pacquiao 
 Mami's a knockout and that's for real 
 Ring the fire alarm, this is not a drill 
 Mami's a knockout and that's for real 
 Ring the fire alarm, this is not a drill 
 I-I-I don't wanna waste your time 
 Big girls don't cry wolf when they cry
