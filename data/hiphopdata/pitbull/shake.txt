 Aqui llego el locito que dice mami ponme lo hay que te la voy a partir 
 Asi asi asi dale, aqui llegaron los animales 
 Con permico mai dale, dale por er pico mami dale 
 Esto es lo que pasa en la discoteqa 
 Cuando estoy tomado y se me para la escopeta 
 Estoy fuera de control, ben paca ben paca ben paca mi amor 
 Tengo la carne y tengo el sason 
 Y podemos jugar pero no dejes el chupon 
 Mami ten cuidado 
 Como los homres en la carse que se les caen el javon

 *Verse 2 (D-Roc)* 
 That little momma is known around the world 
 Shake that ass if u a nasty girl 
 Back that ass up says juvenile 
 Show a nigga some tities like girls gone wild 
 Tear off this clip of clothes, i wanna see u in the nude 
 You can keep on your high heel shoes 
 So follow me down to yellow brick road 
 Where niggas go to see naked hoes 
 Shake that shit bitch 
 And be off in the club with a hard ass dick 
 Then drop like this bitch 
 If you wanna make the money shawty work that shit 
 Put a hump in your back 
 And lick it raw 
 To a 3 point stance 
 But u mess up yo ass 
 You must be on that kanye work out plan 
 Like head shoulder knees hoes 
 *Chorus* 
 Shake shake just shake shake

 Shake shake just shake shake

 *Verse 3 (Kaine)* 
 Take em out in cruise 
 Take em out all dressed 
 Is the realest true niggas in the ATL 
 Yeah we break it down betta shake a booty hoe 
 And them hoes and the girl with the real tight clothes 
 One time for the gang with the ying yang twins 
 We already know we off the reel 
 Dont tolerate that talkin 
 Bitch u can make the walkin 
 Patrollers is where im groaking 
 The only way that we are talkin 
 If your breath smells like mine 
 Girl dont give a fuck cause u fine 
 I miss em fo i kiss em 
 I pack em fo i stack em 
 So while we in the club betta get these girls 
 Cause on the streets there aint no action
