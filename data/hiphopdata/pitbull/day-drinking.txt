Day drinking 
 Sun goes up and drink goes down 
 Gonna pass another round 
 To you and me and all these crazy muthafuckers 
 ] 
 In Little Havana 
 We be eatin' tore up from the floor up, gettin' hammered 
 Can you go down, down, baby, "Country Grammar" 
 Sorry Miss Thang, pardon my grammar 
 But I got gifts and hoes, call me Santa 
 We don't need no holiday 
 No we don't 
 We ain't even on spring break 
 'Cause I know 
 We can make our own va-cay 
 And I can show you how we do it 
 Day drinking 
 Sun goes up and drink goes down 
 Gonna pass another round 
 To you and me and all these crazy muthafuckers 
 Yeah we like to party 
 And like to fuck to "Drunk In Love", Beyoncé 
 Do ya thang, who cares what they all say 
 Put your lips like a ring around my Woo! 
 Now that's a fian-stay 
 We don't need no holiday 
 No we don't 
 We ain't even on spring break 
 'Cause I know 
 We can make our own va-cay 
 And I can show you how we do it
