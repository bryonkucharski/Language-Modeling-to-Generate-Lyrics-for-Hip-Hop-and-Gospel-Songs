 Big star 
 Oh, oh 
 Haters in the club (back up) 
 Gold diggers (back up) 
 Broke niggas (back up) 
 I suggest, I suggest that you (back up) 
 I'm in the club and I cut into the scene 
 Couple of pair fray fool smoking the green 
 She's got her hand on my nuts what does that mean? 
 Pointed at her friend and she said there a tag team 
 Now who said dreams don't come true 
 It's like in dreaming when I come through 
 I always find something to run through 
 Speak into the mic mami mic check one two (ha, ha, ha) 
 Drunk in the club off the chain 
 But who gives a fuck that's why I came 
 So pour it up and get down 
 You have no choice but to listen to Pit now 
 Put your ass in reverse baby (back up) 
 It don't involve money then (back up) 
 Doggy for me and (back up) 
 Every time I fall I get right (back up) 
 Haters in the club (back up) 
 Gold diggers (back up) 
 Broke niggas (back up) 
 I suggest, I suggest that you (back up) 
 Everybody knows Pit's got tight raps 
 When I'm in the club DJ's bring it back 
 When those questions asked but the number one question is (Does he got cash?) 
 Lil Jon's at the bar while me and the Eastside Boyz smoke out 
 Roll another one no doubt 
 Get a couple hoes roll out 
 Beef you don't want none gun go blao 
 Dum diddy dum dum my time's now 
 The city I'm from is coming with better riles 
 That ol' make your crew run, run, your crew run, run 
 It's nice to cum huh 
 Put your ass in reverse baby (back up) 
 It don't involve money then (back up) 
 Doggy for me and (back up) 
 Every time I fall I get right (back up) 
 Haters in the club (back up) 
 Gold diggers (back up) 
 Broke niggas (back up) 
 I suggest, I suggest that you (back up) 
 I convinced mami to creep on the DL 
 Even though my head is spinning like some Sprewells 
 Skip the details 
 It's the bottom line that's testing my patience like doctors 
 I'm not impressed by the cool shit 
 All those jeans all that ice all them cars all that's bullshit 
 If that's what you're looking for keep looking hoe 
 'Cause you got the wrong one bitch I'll let ya know 
 Mami's like damn that groupie shout out 
 Bitch I came to the club to wild out 
 If you came to act up 
 Then you came to get from me bitch and um back up 
 Put your ass in reverse baby (back up) 
 It don't involve money then (back up) 
 Doggy for me and (back up) 
 Every time I fall I get right (back up) 
 Put your ass in reverse baby (back up) 
 It don't involve money then (back up) 
 Doggy for me and (back up) 
 Every time I fall I get right (back up) 
 Haters in the club (back up) 
 Gold diggers (back up) 
 Broke niggas (back up) 
 I suggest, I suggest that you (back up) 
 Haters in the club (back up)
