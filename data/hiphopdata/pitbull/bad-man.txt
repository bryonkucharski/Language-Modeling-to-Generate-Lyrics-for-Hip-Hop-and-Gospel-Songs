 They say he don't rap no more 
 They say like LeBron, he ain't got the heat no more 
 They say he ain't street no more 
 But like Jay say "How sick am I?" wish 'em health for sure 
 But I'm cool with it, act a fool with it 
 Went to one of my old neighborhoods and built a school in it 
 It's crazy baby the way that the 80's made me 
 I thank God every day that music saved me 
 I thank my mom for all the vision she gave me 
 I thank Miami for the way you raised me 
 I'm a bad man, in an evil world (that's right) 
 And you're my type of goody two-shoes girl (give it to me baby) 
 Baby I'm a bad man, in a woman's world (ha, ha) 
 Come on over, give me what I deserve (give it to me baby) 
 Are you ready for love? 
 Come and get it, girl 
 Ooh-ah, ooh-ah 
 Ooh-ah, ooh-ah 
 Ooh-ah, ooh-ah 
 Ooh, come and get it, girl 
 Ooh-ah, ooh-ah 
 Ooh-ah, ooh-ah

 Building a billion dollar business from an ounce 
 Not bad for a Cuban that came from the south 
 Mami let's make like tig ol' bitties and bounce 
 So we can make like a baby in here now 
 I'm cool with it, act a fool with it 
 With my own playbook, I got no rules in it 
 I like the girls that's freaky, wild, yeah, and crazy 
 I like the girls that dirty dance, I'm Swayze 
 I like the girls that's hot, and fire and blazing 
 I like the girls that like the sex amazing 
 I'm a bad man, in an evil world (that's right) 
 And you're my type of goody two-shoes girl (give it to me baby) 
 Baby I'm a bad man in a woman's world (ha, ha) 
 Come on over, give me what I deserve (give it to me baby)

 I know how to move in a room full of woo's 
 Baby, I'm a bad man 
 I'm a good man, good guy, but don't get it confused 
 Baby, I'm a bad man 
 And I still fight every day like I ain't got nothing to lose 
 That's right 
 I'm a bad man, in an evil world (that's right) 
 And you're my type of goody two-shoes girl (give it to me baby) 
 Baby, I'm a bad man in a woman's world (ha, ha)
