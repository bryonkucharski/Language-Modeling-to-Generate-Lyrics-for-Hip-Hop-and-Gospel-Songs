Stephen Marley, let 'em know what time it is 
 We came here to party, we came here to dance 
 You know that you're my girl, damn right I'm your man 
 This night going too good, don't fall for the games 
 Or the he said, she said dumb shit 
 I got a whole lot of names and a whole lot of numbers 
 But I'll throw them away 'cause I think I might love you 
 Could be the Mary Jane or the spell that I'm under 
 But I know what this could be 
 Tearing up my history for you 
 I got, I got, I got, I got options 
 You the, you the, you the, you the top one 
 So baby, baby, if it ain't a problem 
 Can I get some of your love? 
 I got, I got, I got, I got options 
 You the, you the, you the, you the top one 
 So baby, baby, if it ain't a problem 
 Can I get some of your love? 
 Been around the game, been around the fame 
 Been around the money, been around some names 
 But the chico's still the same, some things never change 
 Here's a tip, show me your friends 
 I'll show you your future, keep the change 
 I've seen 'em come and go, I've seen 'em sell they souls 
 You my number one draft pick, baby, let's pick and roll 
 I always keep you up, up on a pedestal 
 Misery loves company, baby, don't sweat these hoes 
 I got a whole lot of names and a whole lot of numbers 
 But I'll throw them away 'cause I think I might love you 
 Could be the Mary Jane or the spell that I'm under 
 But I know what this could be 
 Tearing up my history for you 
 I got, I got, I got, I got options 
 You the, you the, you the, you the top one 
 So baby, baby, if it ain't a problem 
 Can I get some of your love? 
 I got, I got, I got, I got options 
 You the, you the, you the, you the top one 
 So baby, baby, if it ain't a problem 
 Can I get some of your love? 
 They looking for the perfect man 
 They looking for the perfect life 
 They take some perfect pics 
 They want some perfect dick 
 But there ain't nothing perfect, girl 
 No such thing as a perfect world 
 These broads try hard to be 
 Who they not and not who they are 
 Baby, you sweating what? Baby, you sweating who? 
 You talking 'bout such and such who tries to be you? 
 Man, you JFK, mami, you out your mind 
 Misery loves company, I'll tell you one more time 
 I got a whole lot of names and a whole lot of numbers 
 But I'll throw them away 'cause I think I might love you 
 Could be the Mary Jane or the spell that I'm under 
 But I know what this could be 
 Tearing up my history for you 
 I got, I got, I got, I got options 
 You the, you the, you the, you the top one 
 So baby, baby, if it ain't a problem 
 Can I get some of your love? 
 I got, I got, I got, I got options 
 You the, you the, you the, you the top one 
 So baby, baby, if it ain't a problem 
 Can I get some of your love? 
 Baby, you know, you know we got a strong thing 
 So stop thinking 'bout the wrong things 
 You know, you know we got a strong thing 
 So stop thinking 'bout the wrong things 
 I got, I got, I got, I got options 
 You the, you the, you the, you the top one 
 So baby, baby, if it ain't a problem 
 Can I get some of your love? 
 I got, I got, I got, I got options 
 You the, you the, you the, you the top one 
 So baby, baby, if it ain't a problem 
 Can I get some of your love?
