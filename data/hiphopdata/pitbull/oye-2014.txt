Oye, que vuelta come pinga? 
 Uh, uh, uh 
 Hey true, bang it up for the track 
 We gon' take it to the top and that's the truth 
 Truth hurts 
 Ha, ha 
 Oye! 
 If you broke but you still pimpin', drinkin', smokin', then say 
 Oye, oye! 
 If you ballin' buyin' bottles, then say 
 Oye mami! 
 If you pimp in your steps and your ass is fat, then say 
 (Oye papi!) 
 If you willin' to fight then we fuckin' tonight, then say 
 Oye, oye!(Oye!) 
 Oye, oye, oye! 
 All I can see, all the mamis pull your thongs up and party with me 
 On the count of three, everybody claim where your from 
 One, two, three! 
 The Bottom, that's where I'm from, that's where I reside 
 That's what I represent till I die 
 Tuck your chains in, put your drinks down 
 And your sex up and get wild for the night 
 Pit Bull rock stikes move like a Lex truck 
 Mami you got the next stunt (Alright) 
 Piccalo in the V.I.P. whip, four fingers in the air 
 Hollerin' for life 
 I'm the chico that'll put it down for his people 
 Get my hands on any and everything 
 But I always keep my hands clean 
 'Cause Miami's full of dirty money and dirty things 
 Oye! 
 If you broke but you still pimpin', drinkin', smokin', then say 
 Oye, oye! 
 If you ballin' buyin' bottles, then say 
 Oye mami! 
 If you pimp in your steps and your ass is fat, then say 
 (Oye papi!) 
 If you willin' to fight then we fuckin' tonight, then say 
 Oye, oye!(Oye!) 
 Oye, oye, oye! 
 Mami look good from far, but when she got close 
 She was far from good, and I was like "off" 
 I got the vodka, Cubo's got the cranberry juice 
 Now it's time to get loose! 
 Se consigue para lo marinero que tiene mas cadena que cuello 
 Por dinero y una panza que parece que ese comieron le son 
 Entero 
 I see mami who messes with nothin' but big tymers 
 Who loves to get her "Roll On" (Roll on) 
 Askin' me if I could get my hands on some vitamin E 
 And I was like mami hold on 
 But she must've loved Pac 'cause she was grabbin' me, tellin' me 
 "Papi picture me rollin" 
 So I pictured it, and it would've been a sight for the blind to see 
 So I gave it to her for free 
 Oye! 
 If you broke but you still pimpin', drinkin', smokin', then say 
 Oye, oye! 
 If you ballin' buyin' bottles, then say 
 Oye mami! 
 If you pimp in your steps and your ass is fat, then say 
 (Oye papi!) 
 If you willin' to fight then we fuckin' tonight, then say 
 Oye, oye!(Oye!) 
 Oye, oye, oye! 
 Verse three, I said it once and I'll say it again 
 I want all y'all to eat but first me 
 Get it? Got it? Good 
 It's good that you got it 'cause I got no time to be misunderstood 
 I don't know if it's the liquor that's got me lit 
 But damn, mami's thicker than thick 
 If you like coke roll a dollar, snort it up 
 If you like weed then you know the routine 
 Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke that shit 
 Puff puff then pass that shit 
 Mami, mami! Shake ya ass, but watch yourself 
 'Cause messin' with me, you might end up in a movie 
 Literally watchin' yourself, ha 
 Starrin' yo boo, in the hit movie called Amtrack 
 Choo-choo! 
 Oye! 
 If you broke but you still pimpin', drinkin', smokin', then say 
 Oye, oye! 
 If you ballin' buyin' bottles, then say

 (Oye papi!) 
 If you willin' to fight then we fuckin' tonight, then say 
 Oye, oye!(Oye!) 
 Oye, oye, oye!
