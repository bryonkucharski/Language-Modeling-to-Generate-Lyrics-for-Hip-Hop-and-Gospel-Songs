Pitbull 
 : 
 All it takes is, some Voli on the rocks (Havana Brown) 
 Next thing you know, she's on top of the bar 
 No clothes fo'sho (Afrojack) 
 She's telling me to slow down, I live a fast life (Mr. Worldwide) 
 Funny thing is, she wasn't saying that last night-- Dale 
 Havana Brown 
 : 
 I can't believe what we did last night 
 I'm gonna wake up in the morning sun 
 Going nowhere, telling everyone 
 I can't believe what we did last night 
 I wanna say oh my god, that was so much fun 
 Ill never forget it, telling everyone about last night 
 Pitbull 
 : 
 What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas 
 What happens in Miami, never happened 
 Never happened 
 Last night we were off the chain 
 You name it, we did it 
 You loved it fo'sho 
 I can't remember her name, but her ass--That I remember fo'sho! 
 Convenient amnesia 
 Remember the good, forget the bad 
 Remember the present, forget the past 
 She don't get down, then forget that ass 
 One life, two worlds-- English, Spanish 
 One night, two girls-- English, Spanish 
 She's telling me to slow down 
 I live a fast life 
 Funny thing is she wasn't saying that last night-- Dale

 Different night different city 
 Different girl but it's all the same 
 I party every night like my last 
 Be careful buddy you might run into my past 
 I don't got a conscience, 
 And I don't got time to deal with the nonsense 
 I came to get off to everything 
 So alert all the bondsmen, heh 
 One life, two worlds-- English, Spanish 
 One night, two girls-- English, Spanish 
 She's telling me to slow down
