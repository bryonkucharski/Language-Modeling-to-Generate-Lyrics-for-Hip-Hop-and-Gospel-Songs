Pitbull 
 To these rappers I apologize, I know it ain't fair 
 Only ball I drop, New Year's Times Square 
 The world is mine, sixth sense, I see the seven signs 
 Now baby, let's get started for life 
 Shakira 
 Every time I look into your eyes (Mr. Worldwide) 
 I feel like I could stare in them for a lifetime 
 We can get started for life (tonight) 
 For life (tonight) for life (tonight) 
 We can get started for life (tonight) 
 For life (tonight) for life (tonight) 
 We can get started 
 Pitbull 
 You know it feels right 
 Big news, Pitbull, Tom Cruise, Mumbai 
 I lit up their December nights like the Fourth of July, vanilla sky 
 Thrilla in Manila, knocking them out like Pacquiao 
 No Ali, no Frazier, but for now it's off to Malaysia 
 Two passports, three cities, two countries, one day 
 Now that's worldwide, if you think it's a game, let's play, dale 
 Shakira 
 Every time I look into your eyes 
 I feel like I could stare in them for a lifetime 
 We can get started for life (tonight) 
 For life (tonight) for life (tonight) 
 We can get started for life (tonight) 
 For life (tonight) for life (tonight) 
 We can get started 
 Pitbull 
 You know it feels right 
 I am what they thought I'd never become 
 I believed and became it 
 Now I'm here to claim it 
 I hustle anything, you name it, name it 
 I went from eviction to food stamps 
 To baggin' work, wet and damp 
 To a passport, flooded with stamps 
 Now it's Voli everywhere I land 
 Two passports, three cities, two countries, one day 
 Now that's worldwide, if you think it's a game, let's play, dale 
 Shakira 
 'Cause if it feels right (you know it feels right) 
 We shouldn't waste any more time 
 Let's get it started (let's get it started) 
 Don't think about it (let's get it started) 
 You know I'm going to make it alright, alright (let's go) 
 'Cause if it feels right 
 You know I made up my mind 
 Let's get it started (let's get it started) 
 Don't think about it (let's get it started) 
 I know that we can make it alright, alright 
 Every time I look into your eyes 
 I feel like I could stare in them for a lifetime 
 We can get started for life (tonight) 
 For life (tonight) for life (tonight) 
 We can get started for life (tonight) 
 For life (tonight) for life (tonight) 
 We can get started 
 Pitbull 
 Don't start what you can't finish 
 Let's go 
 You know it feels right
