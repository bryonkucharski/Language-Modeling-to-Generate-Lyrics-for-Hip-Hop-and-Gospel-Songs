School y'all to somethin' right quick 
 Sit down, open your ears, close your eyes, listen 
 Here's a little story that I got to tell 
 About this chico named Pit everyone knows so well 
 Illmatic like Nas but that ain't hard to tell 
 Owes it all to Dade County and the ATL 
 Picked rap and skipped the triple beam scale 
 And it's a known fact he gon' die before he fails 
 These boys rap about hustlin' but can't make bail 
 I call that hustling backwards and that's real 
 Miami's hot so I can vacation in hell 
 The way the game is shit, man, I mind as well 
 I look at these fools on camera flashin they tools 
 They must've forgot the streets got codes and rules 
 But me, I'm confused 
 'Cause rappers wanna be gangstas 
 Gangstas wanna be rappers 
 Ballers wanna be rappers 
 And rappers wanna be ballers 
 The truth is its more sickening than Ebola 
 Until they handcuff then it's over 
 Pop up no dandruff, no neck, just head and shoulders 
 Bust guns, sell drugs, that's what the streets showed us 
 But corporate America, that's what they sold us
