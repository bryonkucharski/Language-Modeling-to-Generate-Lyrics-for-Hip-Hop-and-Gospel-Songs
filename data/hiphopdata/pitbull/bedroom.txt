Qwote: 
 Can I get a bedroom encore? 
 Just can't get enough girl I want more 
 From when you feel between the sheets tonight 
 Is more than I can ask for 
 Can I get a bedroom encore? 
 Just can't get enough girl I want more 
 From when you feel between the sheets tonight 
 Is more than I can ask for 
 Pitbull: 
 Mami I just wanna ride you 
 And giddy giddy up, giddy giddy giddy up 
 And take it to the room like 
 Giddy giddy boom boom giddy boom giddy bye bye 
 And taste tu fruta de bomba 
 Como dice el gata 
 Dale muyaya 
 Qwote: 
 Wanna believe in you, what else can I do? 
 Wanna believe it's true when I hold on to you 
 Let's make love right under the moon 
 Baby it's right here in my bedroom 
 Can I get a bedroom encore? 
 Just can't get enough girl I want more 
 From when you feel between the sheets tonight 
 Is more than I can ask for 
 Shawty let go go go 
 Break it down slow slow slow 
 Riding like a pony oh oh 
 Until tomorrow 
 No one ever said goodbye 
 Even if you ask me why 
 I keep trying now 
 I'm finding how I'm gonna love you so 
 Can I get a bedroom encore? 
 Just can't get enough girl I want more 
 From when you feel between the sheets tonight 
 Is more than I can ask for 
 Can I get a bedroom bedroom bedroom... 
 Can I get a bedroom encore? 
 Just can't get enough girl I want more 
 From when you feel between the sheets tonight 
 Is more than I can ask for 
 Wanna believe in you, what else can I do? 
 Wanna believe it's true when I hold on to you 
 Let's make love right under the moon 
 Baby it's right here in my bedroom
