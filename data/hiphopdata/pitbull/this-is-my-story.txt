Superstar I am! I haven't dropped the classic, 
 No Illmatic, it was written, all I am! 
 Honest to the public, that I am! 
 Mr. 305 that I am, 
 A rapper I'm not, perhaps that's you! 
 A hater I'm not so perhaps that's you! 
 Signed a fucked up deal, perhaps that's true, 
 But I own my publishin', unlike you. 
 If y'all would look passed all my hits, 
 Notice when I say: 'All my hits!' 
 Pete's got a track record unlike them, 
 Money made me see 
 My enemies is really just my friends! 
 Riding a Lamborghini but not till the end 
 Money's what you got, not what you spend, 
 Listen to this verse here, closely 
 These boys are soft like butter, 
 But they still wanna toast me, 
 So put your hands up, nice and slowly 
 This is stick up, 
 Now give me what you owe me 
 TVT now, you know what it is, 
 I'ma make your name world wide 
 For not paying us shitttt
