 (What would the music be without sounds?) 
 Young Bo$$, Miss Trina, Pitbull 
 Let's show 'em how we get down 
 I party like a rock star 
 I look like a movie star 
 I play like an all-star 
 I fuck like a porn star 
 Baby I'm a superstar 
 Always posted at the bar 
 Always wit' a couple broads 
 Maybe I'm just dat dat raw 
 Dawg check da résumé 
 I hit somethin' every day 
 Ask about me and they'll say 
 That chicko run MIA 
 Pitbull, Young Bo$$ 
 That's fire 
 Go girl wear it out 
 Till you're tired 
 Just tryin' to pay tuition 
 Liar 
 My corner is like HBO's wire 
 So please don't play no games 
 And baby don't say no names 
 And we can do this one more again 
 Next time you can bring your friends 
 (Pitbull and Young Bo$$) 
 So go get your friends 
 And I get my friends 
 And we can be friends 
 Do dis every weekend 
 We can hit your place 
 We can hit my place 
 She's on my top 8 
 I bagged her off of MySpace

 Shake dem dice and roll 'em 
 Shake dem dice and roll 'em

 You say dat's the hustle man 
 (Young Bo$$) 
 Girl I wanna know your name 
 Girl who you be? 
 Don't care wit' who you came 
 As long as you leave wit' me 
 What you sippin' on? 
 I'll buy you a drink 
 Get you in them shiny things 
 Your grill be pink 
 I see those Jimmy Choos 
 Those Vera Wangs 
 I love the way you work 
 Girl do your thing 
 You see my stunna shades

 My click is full of ballas
