Ah le leke leke leke leke leke... 
 It's Pit there, for sure 
 Now get down, get low 
 Who's got Miami all night long 
 That's not a question, no more 
 The world is my block 
 The globe is my home 
 It's a proof, in fact 
 But that chico got his own 
 I don't spit it down, gotta live it 
 Millions of dollars, go get it 
 Billions of them 
 Now way, watch out 
 I don't call, now slim it 
 When I blast the game 
 And I'm more like 
 "Yeah, kill it" 
 I'll be up all night 
 Go ahead and be the realist 
 All the ladies when you're ready let me let me know 
 Dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing 
 Where she'd said she go? 
 All the ladies when you're ready let me let me know 
 Dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing 
 Where she'd said she go? 
 All the ladies when you're ready let me let me know 
 Dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing 
 Where she'd said she go? 
 Pit showed up and broke up 
 On stage with two big booties 
 Yo, like me, it's cool 
 I'm lord of Pit, Pit's suma 
 They count it, what school me 
 Y'all fools, you can't fool me 
 I'd never worried 'bout beef 
 Because my brother is 6th Avenue 
 I got that point out of my blood 
 All I know is how to lead teams 
 I grew up around, no kinda games from T.N. 
 As IPs, HCs, BOBs, LPs, VIPs 
 So pale, shine oh, wide low, 
 All the ladies when you're ready let me let me know 
 Dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing 
 Where she'd said she go? 
 All the ladies when you're ready let me let me know 
 Dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing 
 Where she'd said she go? 
 All the ladies when you're ready let me let me know 
 Dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing 
 Where she'd said she go? 
 It's that shit that defines me 
 MBA came find me 
 Even if they did I'd sell for two billion, smiling (ha ha) 
 Mo lokey no sirens, grew up around keys and violence 
 Was taught to stay silent 
 Now silence 
 All the ladies when you're ready let me let me know 
 Dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing 
 Where she'd said she go? 
 All the ladies when you're ready let me let me know 
 Dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing 
 Where she'd said she go? 
 All the ladies when you're ready let me let me know 
 Dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing 
 Where she'd said she go?
