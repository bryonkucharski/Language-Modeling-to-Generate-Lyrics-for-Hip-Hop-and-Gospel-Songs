Toby Love, Scott Little, it's that little chico Pitbull 
 Now let me see you go to work on that strip pole 
 I love it when you work that hit the floor 
 How you do that gimme some more 
 Humpback, humpback, hoochie momma 
 All I really want is some coochie momma 
 You a star when you work the pole 
 We don't make it rain we make it snow 
 When you go fast then break it down slow 
 From the window to the wall 
 Get low 
 This is for the strippers that be shaking for them tips 
 Big oh ass big oh tits, pretty ass pussy, pretty ass lips 
 Baby your amazing... 
 Tell me who your creeping with, I wanna know 
 Lying to my face again 
 I know you on the low 
 My boys done told me that your doin' wrong 
 So baby tell me 
 No le hagas caso daddy 
 Yo solo soy tuya, amor 
 Deja que se mueran de envidia, no bailo desnuda 
 You think that I'm a fool babe 
 Don't make me lose my cool babe 
 Not tryin' to hear what you say 
 You can't play me 
 You must go 
 I caught you on that stripper pole 
 Ain't never gonna trust you no 
 Ass in the air, grabbin' dollars while you droppin' like oh oh oh oh... 
 You don't know the half of it 
 I found you out last Friday 
 Thought I was out to get you 
 At the club I met Peaches 
 She said she knew your secret 
 I asked if you were hookin' or creepin' 
 I had a quick lap dance 
 Damn near skeed in my pants (Whoa) 
 Look how bitches got me sweatin' in my white-T 
 Lovin' how she do me 
 Then I saw you in stilettos and a thong 
 Shaking that booty to the "Do the Brown" song (Do the Brown) 
 Shorty gots to go ooh oh... 
 You must go 
 I caught you on that stripper pole 
 Ain't never gonna trust you no 
 Ass in the air grabbin' dollars while your droppin' like oh oh oh oh [x2] 
 Let me see you climb the pole to the top 
 Let go, make it drop 
 Make it clap, don't stop 
 One check at a time don't stop 
 I've been waiting all night to see you take it off 
 I got some paper baby you can take it all 
 What you wanna do? 
 We can go to the back boom, boom fo' sho 
 These just them things that be going down in them strip clubs 
 Bend over baby come over and get these crispy dubs 
 No le hagas caso daddy 
 Solo soy tuya, amor 
 Deja que se mueran de envidia, no bailo desnuda 
 You think that I'm a fool babe 
 Don't make me lose my cool babe 
 Not trying to hear what you say 
 You can't play me 
 You must go 
 I caught you on that stripper pole 
 Ain't never gonna trust you no 
 Ass in the air grabbin' dollars while you droppin' like oh oh oh oh... [x2] 
 How you gonna play this thug
