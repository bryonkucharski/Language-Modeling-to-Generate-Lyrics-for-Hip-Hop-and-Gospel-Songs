Mr. Worldwide, I just want to welcome everybody to my life 
 It's heaven on earth, but it's one hell of a ride 
 Let's show everybody why love is a battlefield 
 Tell them how you feel 
 We are young, heartache to heartache we stand 
 No promises, no demand 
 Both of us knowing, love is a battlefield 
 Closed the Grammys and got all the credits, literally 
 But I'm a hustler boy, you can't rid of me 
 I'm not religious but my passport looks like a bible 
 Presidential debates unreliable 
 Politicians want to politick and politrick 
 That's why I call this shit politricks 
 I'm a young man, old soul 
 I can't listen to this new school shit 
 To me it's just so-so 
 I did my own thing, created my own lane 
 I may not like the players, but I love the game 
 I love the hustle and that's real 
 And that's why love is a battlefield 
 We are young, heartache to heartache we stand 
 No promises, no demand 
 Love is a battlefield 
 We are strong 
 No one can tell us we're wrong 
 Searching our hearts for so long 
 Both of us knowing, love is a battlefield 
 Born in Miami, Cuban boy in the '80s 
 Took over the game and they thought we were crazy 
 You name it we did, we bought it, we sipped it, we run it 
 Let all these public traded companies know that we're coming 
 David vs. Goliath, live in the flesh, Armando Perez, boy am I blessed 
 I learned from the worst, but listened to the best 
 Figure out that riddle and figure out success 
 I did my own thing, created my own lane 
 I may not like the players, but I love the game 
 I love the hustle and that's real 
 And that's why love is a battlefield 
 We are young, heartache to heartache we stand 
 No promises, no demand 
 Love is a battlefield 
 We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong 
 Searching our hearts for so long 
 Both of us knowing, love is a battlefield
