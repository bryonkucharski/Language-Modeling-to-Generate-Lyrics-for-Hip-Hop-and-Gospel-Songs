Pa-ra pa-pa-pa-pa-pa 
 Pa-pa-pa-pa 
 (Repeat 4x) 
 (Verse 1 - Pitbull) 
 Woke up this mornin' with my pockets on E 
 F-ck being broke men this sh-t ain't for me 
 I'm lookin' for a lick, was sh-ttin' on them bricks 
 Makin' it rain in the club, outside jack boy sh-t 
 Make them strip in the dough 
 Drop that shit, hit that flow 
 Blow that shit, that's the show 
 'Cause if you do them things would go pa 
 Pa-ra pa-pa-pa-pa-pa 
 Pa-pa-pa-pa 
 (Repeat 4x)
