I'd advise you to turn back 
 It's not safe 
 Rock Bottom 
 On the map 
 Where's it at 
 (Cubo) 
 Papa Dade county nigga I rest my feam 
 Triple my dough with a triple beam 
 Laid back in the back with a cat on my lap 
 And a fastac ready to serve a feen 
 I live a dream and work my spot 
 I ain't talking about clicking rocks 
 I'm talkin' 'bout that shit you blow 
 When you ride around and you push that drop 
 Blueberry I put you down, 38 might get you a pound 
 34 how the fuck you sound 
 And 33 get a bitch shot down 
 Come down to overtown 
 Where them boys roll with a 4 pound 
 And and 4-5 with a deuce-deuce 
 Look at all boys they get loose 
 Watch out, Cubo's coming 
 Coming through when he spitting something 
 Some of y'all are spitting nothing 
 Frontin' like you killing, what! 
 Imma rep, 305, till the day, that I die 
 You niggas got a problem with a nigga like this 
 In the club, that shit, we could go outside 
 Let 'em fly, ride a clip, lose the clip, shoot the clip 
 Y'all niggas don't want no beef with me 
 I'm telling you niggas seriously 
 Ain't nothing wrong with bangers 
 Leave a nigga cooked like angus 
 Niggas wanna drop with that anus 
 I'm telling y'all niggas we dangerous 
 (Pitbull) 
 Rock rock bottom, more the math, where it's at 
 There's no receipts in these streets 
 If you caught it, you keep it, that's that 
 I got that fal-con of glued mentality 
 I do this for every hood, every block 
 To the ones that push keys 
 To the ones that push petty rocks 
 If you pull off that, then I pull it pop 
 Lemme show how them boys down here roll 
 They know how to cook a yellow slab 
 And stash their mouth with yellow gold 
 No job's a handful of work 
 And the bitches down here work poles 
 These bootlegers pimp harder 
 They niggas they the ones that work hoes 
 D-A-D-E where we sell coke and hoes 
 From pools to C-C-O-T to OP, Windwood, to AP 
 Them boys up pull up in the van, jump out like the A-Team 
 And they love, and they love to spray things 
 Let's not talk about the night 
 Cause this just a motherfucking day thing 
 Welcome to the bottom, we call it the crib 
 B-E-T, that's how we live, banana clips (?) 
 You banana split, we got plenty bullets to give 
 So fuck that South Beach shit, yeah, that's what it is 
 Next time y'all come to the bottom 
 Make sure y'all come over the bridge 
 (Bun B) 
 I'm from the bottom of the map, the bottom of the atlas 
 The bottom of the globe, where they stuffing dope in the mattress 
 And how do they cash into yours, stashing guns in they rides 
 And be the snitch ass niggas be badder than pride 
 I'm in that big body, pins on fold, no grub 
 I don't ride with a (?), and I don't roll with scrubs 
 I don't party in clubs, and don't laugh and clown 
 Keep it one hundred and one, man don't be fucking around 
 Cause in my side of the city, pretty shit don't live 
 Nice shit don't exist, and ain't no love to give 
 What you want out of this life you gots to go out and take it 
 'Cause they ain't giving one no opportunities to make it 
 You come in this world naked, and mama can dress you 
 But sooner or later, you come out and deal with the pressure 
 There are niggas that you've lost only to not return 
 So whatever you've earned, protect it, (?) 
 It's time you learned
