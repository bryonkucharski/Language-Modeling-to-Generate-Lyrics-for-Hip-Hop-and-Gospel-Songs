 Chain 200 grand 
 Watch with matchin' band

 Candy paint we drip wet

 With Killa Cam and Dip Set 
 I'm packin2 bangers 
 The other rapper ain't gangsta 
 (Why?) 
 You had to say my name 
 And you still ain't famous 
 (Damn) 
 Clover G's don't take no shit 
 We bake them bitches to come up 
 Keep runnin' you lip my gun 
 On my hip so don't run up 
 Creepin' on a come up 
 With million dollar shoe deal 
 Old cars with new wheels 
 Yellow rocks in blue steal 
 You know Lil Flip got skills 
 You know Lil Flip got mills 
 You can ask B.E.T how the fuck I live 
 They know I'm rich as fuck 
 So nuck if you buck 
 'Cause down in Houston Texas 
 We jammit screwed up 
 We riddin' 84's and we also poppin' trunk
