 Imma kill 'em in the club with this one 
 Imma tear the club the fuck up 
 Imma have 'em goin' to war over this one 
 Partna, just listen 
 If you don't want those things to click-clack 
 Take a few steps back 
 Because I'm playin' for keeps, go ahead keep playin' with me 
 And watch how I hit 'em in the head once again 
 For those who didn't believe in the kid 
 Y'all might as well be dead 
 Because what y'all thought couldn't be done, I did 
 I'm like Ray Charles dawg, I don't see none of y'all 
 I'm blind to the fact that half of y'all rap, and I'm outrunnin' y'all 
 When I hit 'em from the back 
 I got them mamis saying dammit man 
 When I put it in they mouth 
 I got them mamis saying duh-huh-huh-muh (Time out, woo!) 
 When I hit 'em from the back 
 I got them mamis saying dammit man 
 When I put it in they mouth 
 I got them mamis saying duh-huh-huh-muh 
 Put that up dammit 
 But me and you both know that these niggas ain't ready 
 They're just too petty, I'm just too deadly (Woo!) 
 When you see them boys 'round your way, holla dammit man! (Dammit man!) 
 When you see them boys 'round your way, holla dammit man! (Dammit man!) 
 When you see them boys 'round your way, holla dammit man! (Dammit man!) 
 When you see them boys 'round your way, holla dammit man! (Dammit man!)

 Pitbull's that underrated, underdog, killin' the underground 
 But that's just an understatement 
 It's hard to understand why I'm still underpaid 
 Just look in my blue eyes and see the hunger and pain, dammit man 
 But I don't plan it man, because I do what I wanna do, move what I wanna move 
 Y'all gonna see what I mean when I live out my dreams 
 Imma tell you like Biggie told me, cash rules everything around me 
 I could give a fuck about what you say about me 
 'Cause when those things get pulled out and squeezed, they'll spray about three 
 Hit 'em up, wet 'em up, get 'em up, give it up, that's how it goes 
 Pit's gon' spit it up, flip it up, rip it up, but I'm a pro (Time out, woo!) 
 Hit 'em up, wet 'em up, get 'em up, give it up, that's how it goes 
 Pit's gon' spit it up, flip it up, rip it up, but I'm a pro 
 So all y'all amateur ass niggas do-don't try to sit home 
 Pit's co-co-comin', runnin' gunnin' fo-for that throne 
 When you see them boys 'round your way, holla dammit man! (Dammit man!) 
 When you see them boys 'round your way, holla dammit man! (Dammit man!) 
 When you see them boys 'round your way, holla dammit man! (Dammit man!) 
 When you see them boys 'round your way, holla dammit man! (Dammit man!)
