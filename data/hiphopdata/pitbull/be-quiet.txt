Shakespeare 
 Mr. 305 
 This is to them boys that be in the club that talk a whole lot of nothing 
 Shhh... 
 Be quiet 
 Keep it cool, you don't wanna start a riot 
 Shhh... 
 Be quiet 
 Keep it cool, you don't wanna start a riot 
 Let's ride (let's ride) 
 Let's go (let's go) 
 Let's ride, let's ride, let's go (let's go) 
 Let's ride, let's ride, let's go (let's go) 
 Let's ride, let's ride, let's go (let's go) 
 Let the beat ride (hey, hey) 
 Now let the beat ride (hey, hey) 
 Now let the beat ride (hey, hey) 
 Now let the beat ride (hey, hey) 
 Now let the beat ride 
 I'm rolling 
 Through the backstreets 
 Them boys don't applaud 
 But they clap heat 
 I'm in that seven forty-fizzle 
 With them dark boys on it low key 
 Blowing that ooh-eee... 
 Jump out they like who's he? 
 Imma snatch about two or three 
 It's a Dade thing when you speak cocaine 
 Slash perico, chi chi get the yayo mang 
 I'm stating facts 
 This where we from 
 The bottom dawg 
 This where you come 
 When you need it, want it, don't got it, in the drought 
 Looking for a good price 
 Hit 95 south 
 K's as in kilos 
 P's as in pounds 
 E as in ex, 
 We got it on deck 
 So show some respect 
 To the cocaine capital 
 Dade County bitch! 
 Shhh... 
 Be quiet 
 Keep it cool, you don't wanna start a riot 
 Shhh... 
 Be quiet 
 Keep it cool, you don't wanna start a riot 
 Let's ride (let's ride) 
 Let's go (let's go) 
 Let's ride, let's ride, let's go (let's go) 
 Let's ride, let's ride, let's go (let's go) 
 Let's ride, let's ride, let's go (let's go) 
 Let the beat ride (hey, hey) 
 Now let the beat ride (hey, hey) 
 Now let the beat ride (hey, hey) 
 Now let the beat ride (hey, hey) 
 Now let the beat ride 
 Shhh... 
 Be quiet 
 Keep it cool, you don't wanna start a riot 
 I'm cool, I'm quiet 
 A couple shots will put yo' ass on a diet 
 This is for them big boys 
 Doing them big things 
 In the big Chevy's 
 With them big rims 
 Making big noise 
 With them big speakers 
 And any time they cook yaye 
 It's some big beakers 
 Listen buddy 
 We off the chain 
 Now what they do, what it is, what it ain't 
 Listen buddy 
 We off the chain 
 I suggest you hand over them thangs 
 I got my game from Jose Antonio Armando Perez Torrez 
 Ese si era mi consorte 
 And I missed ya dad 
 But I know you watching me 
 With you in heaven 
 I know ain't stopping me 
 The game is mine now 
 I'm building clientele 
 I'm just tryna get paper like Seinfeld 
 Sign, seal, deliver: It's done 
 Ready or not, here I come 
 Dale! 
 Shhh... 
 Be quiet 
 Keep it cool, you don't wanna start a riot 
 Shhh... 
 Be quiet 
 Keep it cool, you don't wanna start a riot 
 Let's ride (let's ride) 
 Let's go (let's go) 
 Let's ride, let's ride, let's go (let's go) 
 Let's ride, let's ride, let's go (let's go) 
 Let's ride, let's ride, let's go (let's go) 
 Let the beat ride (hey, hey) 
 Now let the beat ride (hey, hey) 
 Now let the beat ride (hey, hey) 
 Now let the beat ride (hey, hey) 
 Now let the beat ride 
 Shhh...
