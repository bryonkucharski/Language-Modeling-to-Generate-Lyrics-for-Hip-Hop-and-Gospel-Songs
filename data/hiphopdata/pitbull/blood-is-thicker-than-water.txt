I know y'all listen to my music (redd eyezz) but what I'mma do know is try and describe my life to y'all 
 (Pitbull:) 
 Sometimes I fell like I'm losing it 
 My life is upside down 
 A gift and a curse that's my life now 
 There is no looking or turning back 
 I used to watch coke turn to crack that's what made me turn to rap 
 I fell like keanu reeves in the movie devils advocate 
 Confused but blessed with extravagance 
 I thank god for all the opportunities 
 Given the opportunity dem boys would put two in me (bla bla bla) 
 We live in the land of the free, hustlers and thieves 
 I made money now I got uncle sam hustling 
 Me for a quarter of what I make 
 Hand a quarter sentence to a fake and watch them turn state (that's right) 
 Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is) 
 Until the fed's step in (that's just the way it is) 
 Most of these fools are characters 
 Men with no character welcome to America 
 Where we fight for freedom 
 If ain't about oil than we don't need them 
 Ain't that the truth? 
 Pitbull I'm just tell y'all the way I fell 
 Thank god that god made me to keep it real 
 Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is) 
 Until the fed's step in (that just the way it is) 
 Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is) 
 Till that fame step in (that's just the way it is) 
 Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is) 
 Till dem bitches step in (that's just the way it is) 
 Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is) 
 Till that money step in (that's just the way it is) 
 (Redd eyezz:) 
 Huh hun yo 
 After the turf war the smoke clears 
 All these years around these busta I'm convinced there ain't no hope here 
 In the past four years of my lifetime I witness leaders sacrifice freedom just to get this pipeline 
 Guess I'm chosen at the right time mama stress 
 Facing the table and she's snorting up white line 
 Blood is thicker than water 
 In a few cases your daughter can have touched for the money that in dem suit case 
 Tighten my shoelaces the fugitive running 
 In fear of a criminal past 'cause dem folks is coming 
 I've been wrongfully judged being from this environment 
 The city gangs planning retirement 
 I'mma a dade nigga 
 Voicing my set 'cause a spray quick 
 Took some of the same steps through little haiti as these main nigga (like who) hit man, big dogg, and shehound 
 Y'all predict it back then shit I see it know 
 Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is) 
 Until the fed's step in (that just the way it is) 
 Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is) 
 Till that fame step in (that's just the way it is) 
 Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is) 
 Till dem bitches step in (that's just the way it is) 
 Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is) 
 Till that money step in (that's just the way it is) 
 (Pitbull:) 
 I escape poverty (poverty) 
 I don't own jewelry motherfucker I own property 
 You can send dem tsunamis that hit indonesia (but but but) 
 Ain't no motherfucking thing stopping me 
 Like good coke I'm a good swimmer god knows I done lost but god dam I'm a good winner 
 It feels great to make something out of nothing yeah I'm humble but I tell y'all to push a chico's buttons 
 And watch how them thing get to dumping 
 Real-estate new york game now you saying something 
 I only talk about what I know about 
 Illegal turn legal this year that's what I'm all about 
 I'm from the south and I ain't gonna lie 
 At fist time I preach ye till god struck me with pride 
 I was confused now I'm like let's ride 
 305 till I die 
 305 till I die 
 Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is) 
 Until the fed's step in (that just the way it is) 
 Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is) 
 Till that fame step in (that's just the way it is) 
 Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is) 
 Till dem bitches step in (that's just the way it is) 
 Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is) 
 Till that money step in (that's just the way it is)
