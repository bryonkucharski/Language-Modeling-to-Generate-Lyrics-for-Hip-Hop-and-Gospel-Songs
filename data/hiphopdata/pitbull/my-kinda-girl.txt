Intro - Pitbull: 
 My girl is the kind of girl that walks in this world, (Mr. Worldwide) 
 Other girls want my girl, which I think is cool. (Nelly) 
 My girl is what these other girls wanna be, 
 But that's what she's with me, my kinda girl! 
 Chorus - Nelly: 
 You're like my kinda girl, 
 She walk like my kinda girl, 
 She talk like my kinda girl, 
 I guess my kinda girl is you! 
 So I think I better get in line, 
 Get in line, get in line, 
 Get in line, get in line, get in line 
 Yeah! cause every nigga in here want you! 
 Verse 1 - Pitbull: 
 You name it, she's got it,.. realistic about it, 
 Disrespecting, acting fool in public, I doubt it! 
 If this skeleton is in a closet, that's where she keeps it, 
 I don't do business with sharks, so she stays quiet and peeps 'em. 
 Even if she's playing with time sequence, she keeps 'em, 
 Never goes through his mind, she respects the crown, 
 I respect her mind, that's why I made her, man! 
 For me she'll fight the world, and that's my kinda girl! 
 Verse 2 - Pitbull: 
 My kind of girl, yeah, she's got a vision! 
 That's food for thought; now let 'em haters do the dishes! 
 A pair of high heels and her stockings business, 
 And ain't talking fishing, she's got a six sense. 
 ... Don't impress her, 
 She'll break a full... so watch how you press her! 
 She came some nothing till she know some, yeah, that's true! 
 For me she'll fight the world, and that's my kinda girl! 
 Bridge - Pitbull and Nelly: 
 My girl is the kinda girl that walks in the room, 
 Other girls want my girl, which I think is cool. 
 My girl is what these others girls wanna be, 
 But that's why she's with me, my kinda girl! 
 Outro - Nelly: 
 Sometimes she's,.. sometimes she's... 
 And when she's with me, she know she's good, 
 Yeah, she's my town ass bitch!
