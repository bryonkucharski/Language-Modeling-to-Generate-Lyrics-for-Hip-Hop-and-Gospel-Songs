 It's a 3-oh-5 movement, better say a revolution 
 And you know we got it on lock 
 Let 'em know-ah - yeah, yeah, yeah [x4] 
 Dis "Da Bottom" nigga! 
 Pitbull got 'em shook now 
 All y'all boys want is real crack rap get the coke start a cookout 
 Cause, I don't know nuttin 'bout nuttin nowhere 
 So don't even go there 
 To the police, feds, and the DEA 
 I'd rather be dead than a snitch all day 
 Bust head, bust lead with the same boys 
 That I break bread with - "Da Bottom" bitch! 
 Gotta speed it up, Miami heat it up 
 Y'all better D 'em up 
 These haters are worthless like a ki uncut 
 We don't see them, but they damn sure see us 
 Got 'em callin on Jesus, believe us 
 When we say we hit nuttin but bad bitches and divas, so leave us 
 The hell alone unless you wanna catch a fever 
 From the heater, 3-oh-five, let's ride, let's go 
 Let 'em know - yeah, yeah, yeah

 Let 'em know - yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
