 Hey Jim Jones, let's show these boys how it really goes down 
 Hey Lil Jon, you know what we tell these boys when they campin' out wit' the blunt, right? 
 We tell 'em puff, puff, pass wit' yo' pussy ass 
 I said puff, puff, pass wit' yo' pussy ass 
 I smell that sticky icky, who got that sticky icky? 
 I got that sticky icky, icky, icky 
 I smell that sticky icky, who got that sticky icky? 
 I got that sticky icky, icky, icky 
 I smell that sticky (oh yeah) 
 Who got that sticky? (I do)

 Who got that sticky? (me too)

 Who got that sticky? (I do)

 You know the drill, break it up, break it up 
 You know the drill, roll it up, roll it up 
 You know the drill, light it up, light it up 
 You know the drill, smoke it up, smoke it up 
 Now puff, puff, pass wit' yo' pussy ass 
 You fuckin' up the rotation, that thang there burnin' fast 
 This ain't a joke, stop playin', I need to smoke 
 This thang can get dirty and I ain't talkin' 'bout sprinklin' coke 
 I need that sticky icky, that Miami crippy 
 That Washington High purple, watch out that thang will hurt you 
 I need that Cali chronic, damn, a chico on it 
 Some of that Seattle supersonic will have you like Nevada want it fucked up 
 That's right, high as a kite 
 Now roll the next one and pass me the light 
 'Cause we ready fo' sho', ready to go 
 Ready to blow, let's roll 
 I smell that sticky icky, who got that sticky icky? 
 I got that sticky icky, icky, icky 
 I smell that sticky icky, who got that sticky icky? 
 I got that sticky icky, icky, icky

 If thirty's the new twenty, Patrón's the new Henney 
 Roll in a new Bentley, blowin' like two twenty 
 That ain't the price of the car, now that's a half ounce of piff, dawg 
 You gotta have a strong chest just to hit the raw 
 Or you'll be coughin' up a lung 
 Harlem, where we from so of course we gettin' drunk (twisted) 
 We hit the parties, poppin' bottles just for fun 
 Smokin' weed in your club, call the coppers, let 'em come 
 Miami, Trey O Five, we cop it out the bro house 
 A generator so the lights don't go out 
 A big profit in that greenery 
 We now stoppin' by the beach just for scenery 
 When here it's 45, up here it's 65 
 Meet you in Carolina, get it for 55 
 (We got them pounds) Nigga 'cause every day we hustlin' 
 It's heavy cake and druggin' it, so heavyweight we smuggle it 
 (Pitbull)
