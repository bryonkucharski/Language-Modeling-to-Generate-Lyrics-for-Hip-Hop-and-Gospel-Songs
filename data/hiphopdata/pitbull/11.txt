(Vein) 
 Vein! 
 (Pitbull) 
 Someone point me to the nearest park (Mr. Worldwide) 
 (Intro - Vein) 
 Let's have some fun 
 I mind my business like (whistle) 
 Waiting his clock to strike (whistle) 
 (It's a celebration) 
 (Pre-Chorus - Vein) 
 Everybody rise 
 I wanna make a toast to me tonight 
 It's 11: 59 
 And I can't wait till the clock strikes 12 
 (Chorus - Pitbull) 
 So I can jump jump jump jump jump jump 
 I just wanna jump jump jump jump jump jump 
 Everybody jump jump jump jump jump jump 
 I just wanna jump jump jump jump jump jump 
 (Verse 1 - Vein) 
 I'm a live it up 
 Today I don't give a what 
 Let me re-phrase that 
 Today I don't give a fuck 
 I just wanna jump jump like I'm a dunk dunk 
 I'm bout to dribble all through here 
 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 like it's the new year 
 It's my day first time, I want all my shine 
 Even though I won't remember at all 
 I'll prob'ly end up in a broll 
 I'm going toe to toe with the wall 
 (Verse 2 - Pitbul) 
 We shut down Times Square, extra extra read all about it 
 New year, it's our year, to be clear, we here 
 Immigrant parents but I'm living the American dream for them now 
 It's it's it's about to go down 
 This is for Eddie, Bobby, Rudy, Johnny 
 Up in the sky drinking poly loddy doddy 
 I don't need a Maybach or Buggati 
 Couple of beds and some sheets, that's a party 
 Go DJ, blow the speakers 
 All my women wear heels, no sneakers 
 Grim reaper, the night is mine 
 Meet me at 11:59 
 (Pitbull) 
 I think I'll fuck the track now 
 (Bridge - Pitbull) 
 I want everybody to put their glasses in the air right now 
 And now that you got 'em up 
 (Breakdown - Vein) 
 Not let's make a toast 
 Put 'em higher now, get 'em so much higher for me 
 Not let's make a toast 
 Reach for the sky right now for it's so much higher than me
