(The New Royales) 
 Money got your tongue tied 
 It's a slow ride up till you're goin' down 
 Funny how your friends lie 
 It's a landslide when you wear the crown. 
 (Give it to me) 
 (Pitbull) 
 The people you see on the way up 
 Same people you don't see on the way down 
 (Can't stop me now) 
 The people you see on the way up 
 Same people you don't see on the way down 
 (Can't stop me now) 
 They said I couldn't do it but I did it 
 Fought TBP, beat the most attention 
 Met with all labels they didn't get it. 
 Now I'm taken over, fuck with it. 
 Time to get flithy rich, try to stay not guilty bitch 
 They said they used to handle bricks 
 I believe them when they projects are brick 
 All they rap about is crack and coke 
 Knowin' they ain't never dealt crack or coke 
 Yeah it's a joke but thanks 
 'Cause I'm laughin' all the way to the bank

 It's not how you fall, it's how you get back up, dawg 
 Struggle, hustle, fight hard, that's all I know, that's right, dawg 
 Blood of a king, heart of a lion (heart of a lion) 
 Based on rental, pussy boy 
 Someone please pass me the iron 
 Death before dishonor, 
 That means for years I've been dyin' 
 Stop your blood clots cryin', 
 I'm here to save Private Ryan
