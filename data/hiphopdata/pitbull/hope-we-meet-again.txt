We could be anywhere tonight 
 Could be right here underneath the lights 
 I see the colours in your eyes 
 Beautiful rainbows all around us 
 We got the whole world in our hands (Mr. Worldwide) 
 This is the night we won't forget (Chris Brown) 
 Whatever happens in the end 
 I just hope, I hope we meet again 
 La la la la la 
 La la la la la 
 La la la la la 
 I just, I hope we meet again 
 One thing's for certain, two things for sure 
 Iheartradio, I close show 
 My life's like broadway 
 No camera welcome to the show 
 One champ for them boys in dictment 
 Broadway, negro, I'm poser than posed 
 My boy I told ya, baby coming back one day 
 Throw this song to the world and watch her catch it like a bouquet 
 Australia or the uk jump the puddle straight to the UK 
 Its okay let 'em hate, 'cause they'll be coming back one day, dale 
 We could be anywhere tonight 
 Could be right here underneath the lights 
 I see the colours in your eyes 
 Beautiful rainbows all around us 
 We got the whole world in our hands 
 This is the night we won't forget 
 Whatever happens in the end 
 I just hope, I hope we meet again 
 La la la la la 
 La la la la la 
 La la la la la 
 I just, I hope we meet again 
 Now the world is my backyard 
 And I would like to thank y'all 
 'Cause I was at point, point blank 
 That I would point blank y'all 
 I found myself intern I lost my mind 
 Sometimes I feel like an old school manny better lost in time 
 They say to be wise, is to know what you don't know 
 And I don't know shit, does that make me wise, papo I don't know 
 But this mean I can't say, to my friend eddie, my father, guarilla, abuelo rudy, to my brother drama I'll be back for you one day 
 We could be anywhere tonight 
 Could be right here underneath the lights 
 I see the colours in your eyes 
 Beautiful rainbows all around us 
 We got the whole world in our hands 
 This is the night we won't forget 
 Whatever happens in the end 
 I just hope, I hope we meet again 
 La la la la la 
 La la la la la 
 La la la la la 
 I hope we meet again 
 I hope we meet again 
 I hope we meet again
