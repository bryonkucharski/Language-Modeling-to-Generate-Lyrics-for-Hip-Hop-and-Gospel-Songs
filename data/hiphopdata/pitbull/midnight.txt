 It's the 3-0-5 till it kill me 
 I'm like a deck of cards 
 Ya gotta deal with me 
 Want war? Then Navy Seal with me 
 I don't need ice for women to chill with me 
 Drivin' crazy like Bobby did Whitney 
 Or like Kevin did Britney 
 Or maybe like Kanye did 50 
 I'm as drunk as a skunk, high as a hippie 
 Whole lot of vodka, lil bit of Crippie 
 All suckee-suckee, please no hickey 
 Baby mess with me, I'll have you in da

 Wanna taste ya (taste ya) 
 Wanna feel ya (feel ya)

 But them nights (nights) 
 Only happen (happen) 
 Once in ya life (life) 
 And I ain't rappin' 
 I wanna take ya till ecstasy without ecstasy 
 Just follow me (follow me) 
 And let me do the things I want to 
 I promise baby that you'll want me to 
 I wanna strap ya, shake ya, break ya 
 Make ya lose ya mind, lose control and lose it all 
 C'mon baby, I make it hot weather - spring, summer, fall 
 That's why
