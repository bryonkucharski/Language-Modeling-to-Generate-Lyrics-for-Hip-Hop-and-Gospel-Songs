(Timbaland, David Guetta, 
 Mister World Wide, 
 Here we go!) 
 Everybody goes dance floor and give it up 
 Baby put it down and give it up 
 Nigga, set the floor and take it up 
 Baby, put it down and give it up 
 Everybody goes dance floor and give it up 
 Baby put it down and give it up 
 Nigga, set the floor and take it up 
 Baby, put it down and give it up 
 So listen a couple girls 
 Who was in and now I mess with cover girls 
 Of magazines, you can catch me on a cover, girl 
 I created my own planet to hover the earth and cover the world 
 I spit so sick, I'm calling the world 
 I see you tryna claim her now I play with her pearls 
 ? 
 ? But I made her my girl 
 Now she does what I say, does what I please 
 ? She lives on her knees 
 Jack and Jill went up the hill 
 Each with a buck and a quarter 
 Jill came back with $2.50 
 What a working girl! 
 Now work it, girl! Like 
 Hey girl, I like to do it, but when I do it, oh oh my God 
 Hey girl, I like to do it, but when I do it, oh oh my God 
 Oh oh my God, oh oh my God, oh oh my God, I like to do it 
 I love when you make a pass at me, a pass at me 
 I love when you make a pass at me, a pass at me 
 I love when I see your pretty ass on the floor 
 I like when I see you break it down like you in control 
 I gotta ? and I cripple my left 
 With Timbaland they can't make a breath 
 ? 
 I got a girl to my right and a girl to my left 
 The one in the middle and I'm feeling on her breasts 
 Hey girl, I like to do it, but when I do it, oh oh my God 
 Hey girl, I like to do it, but when I do it, oh oh my God 
 Oh oh my God, oh oh my God, oh oh my God, I like to do it 
 I love when you make a pass at me, a pass at me 
 I love when you make a pass at me, a pass at me 
 I love when I see your pretty ass on the floor 
 I like when I see you break it down like you in control 
 I love when you make a pass at me, a pass at me 
 I love when you make a pass at me, a pass at me
