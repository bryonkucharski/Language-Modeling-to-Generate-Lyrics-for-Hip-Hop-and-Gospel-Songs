Ricky Ross, with something special right here 
 Excuse the marijuana, just trying to drug myself 
 We got some gangstas in the house too 
 Come on 
 I got a bunch of dollars, I can spend them on her 
 'Cause she can be my lady, she can be my lover 
 Call me on the late night, get right he ain't acting right 
 Every super woman needs a super man, here I am 
 Sight seeing, we might be in 
 The Codra port or that new white BM 
 Home from FAMU with a gorgeous face 
 Next semester she transfer to Florida state 
 Cooking like home-etch for financial aid 
 I highly doubt she has problems with financial aid 
 Remember mean time, my finance is straight 
 I even open up the doors to the penitential states 
 'Cause she used to fight with her moms 
 Till I sat 'em both down, now she's tight with her moms 
 Yeah, I put the ice on her arm, now she know she getting sliced 
 Spending nights in Milan 
 We still blow weed together 
 Cheated on her but we still gon' be together 
 With the house on the water, hit the beach whenever 
 She's from the north and still can't believe the weather, boss 
 I got a bunch of dollars, I can spend them on her 
 'Cause she can be my lady, she can be my lover 
 Call me on the late night, get right he ain't acting right 
 Every super woman needs a super man, here I am 
 Hear I am and here I go 
 Why you looking for that other, when you got the best? 
 The previous was a test for ya, now you in the big league 
 A black Sine brother, who wouldn't wanna play for me? 
 Ya last man was a chump and you can tell him I said it 
 He was talking a lot at first but you can see that dead it 
 You can see I ain't sweat it 
 Hell I'll even call him up myself and tell him I even get it 
 Naw please, don't confuse me, miss 
 I'm tryna see, I could put you on my Christmas list 
 I hope you ain't offended by this 
 But I think your ass fine as shit 
 And that's straight up real talk 
 All bullshit aside, she replied, ?I like to do the wild thing? 
 Action took place at my place 
 Now my place is her place, yeah 
 I got a bunch of dollars, I can spend them on her 
 'Cause she can be my lady, she can be my lover 
 Call me on the late night, get right he ain't acting right 
 Every super woman needs a super man, here I am 
 Mo' better, mo' cheddar, not the man off your clothes, last sweater 
 Hoe getter, gorilla, fuck chuffers I went and got mo' killas, boss 
 I rock with niggas like Fabolous 
 'Cause he tell the truth baby like fabulous 
 But you make it look glamorous 
 Here's spaghetti strapped heels not for amateurs 
 Risk quite rocky, talk like foxy, job like Roxy, spark that broccoli 
 Walk quite aky, let me sexy, I will save you if you let me 
 Fly with me, get high as me I love the alphabet, girl I'm a G 
 Time will tell, Rolex watches, we show stoppas, hoes just watchin' 
 I got a bunch of dollars, I can spend them on her 
 'Cause she can be my lady, she can be my lover 
 Call me on the late night, get right he ain't acting right 
 Every super woman needs a super man, here I am
