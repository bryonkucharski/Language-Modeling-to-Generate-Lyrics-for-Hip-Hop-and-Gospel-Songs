 Yeah nigga! Ha ha 
 Let's go nigga, this is what it is 
 Tupac cut his head bald 
 Then you wanna cut yo' head bald (You PUSSY Nigga!) 
 Tupac wear a bandana 
 You wan' wear a bandana 
 Tupac put a cross on his back 
 You wanna put 2 crosses on yo' back 
 Nigga you ain't Tupac... THIS is Tupac! 
 (Verse One: 2Pac) 
 They say more money and women are funny, 
 But in this tragic endings I can make a million and still not 
 Get enough for spendin' 
 And since my life is based on sinnin', I'm hell-bound 
 I'd rather be buried than be worried different than be held down 
 My game plans to be trained well 
 Military mind of a thug lord sittin' in a cemetery car 
 I've been lost since my adolescent callin from Jesus 
 Ballin' as a gangsta wonderin' if you see this 
 Young black male crack sales got me three strikes 
 Livin' in jail, this is hell, enemies die, 
 Wonder when we all pass, is anybody listenin? 
 Got my hands on my semi-shotgun, everybody's snitchin' 
 Please God can you understand me, bless my family 
 Guide us all before we fall into insanity 
 I'm makin' a point for all my people to be warlike 
 Buy some shit to have you stupid bitches all tight 
 Go niggas wanna get on that's right 
 I gots some niggas in my click that make they muthafuckin' jaws tight now 
 Go niggas wanna get on that's right 
 I gots some niggas in my click that make they muthafuckin' jaws tight now 
 (Pitbull) 
 I'm doing the impossible 
 I gotta big flow that's unbelievable, 
 I'm achieving the unachievable 
 I'm taking over like coke and baking soda 
 The streets are waiting for me 
 But for those who don't know me don't hate on me come on homie 
 Y'all should know me better 
 Don't be mad 'cause I'm a go getter from the bottom of NY to LA 
 Cubans and Essays and old school Chevys 
 Blacks and Hispanics getting money I know y'all can't stand it 
 That's why I say fuck 'em that just gives me more reason to buck 'em 
 If you're felling lucky, then dog, press your luck 
 And watch how quickly you get stuck I'll make sure when they hoes you down 
 You wont get up, Dade County back that up. 
 For building me the way I've been built to the day I get killed 
 I'ma get money and run through bitches like rigid stilts 
 Chamberling emptied the chamber in in your face 
 And leave your brains outa place 
 That's what happens to slow niggas that think they can live life at a fast pace 
 To them boys on the way to Tennesse listening to MJ G breaking there verse down in Eightballs 
 Be careful with them keys 
 Don't hesitate to squeez watch out from them feds 
 'Cause they hate y'all 
 Bank accounts over seas when them Feds come for me all they gonna find is CDs and tapes, dog 
 Sipping hypnotic and hennessy I know y'all envy me but l wont let my tallent go to waste, dog.

 Now since you're cryin for mercy I promise 
 My success'll be the death of you 
 Lo and behold you sold your soul 
 Nigga there's nuttin left of you 
 Look in the mirror, ask yourself who are you? 
 If you don't know who you are, how could your dreams come true? 
 Motherfucker, I sat back and watched 
 You pretended to be 'Pac, you pretended to be hot 
 But you're not NOW! 
 I see it so clear 
 You can't take the pressure, you pussy 
 I warned you not to push me 
 You see me and chills run up your spine 
 Hardly even in the same war, but your heart ain't like mine 
 Press, they look at me like I'm a menace 
 I was playin' with guns 
 While your momma had your punk ass playin' tennis
