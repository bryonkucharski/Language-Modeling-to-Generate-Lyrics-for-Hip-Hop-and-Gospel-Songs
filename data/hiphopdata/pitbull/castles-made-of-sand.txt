So you tried to believe in the castles made of the sand 
 When it flass to the sea and your fear can't find ... 
 Each from my hand. 
 I sacrifice my life to give you my life to speakers, 
 Tryna be good even know I've been crossed like Jesus, 
 God knows I got a good heart but my blood is filled with demons 
 I'm fighting myself, believe me, I'm far from ignorance, 
 Far from greedy if you know where I come from 
 Know what I've been through, you think that should have been another outcome 
 Just like most kids or father did it without one come 
 From the city, with a x you like malcom 
 Then you wanna outcome 
 I can move in the room full of wolves so switched so smooth, 
 Thank you mom for making me a man 
 Let 'em mother fuckers knock my castle in the sand 
 So you tried to believe in the castles made of the sand 
 When it falls to the sea and your fear can't find ... 
 Each from my hand, each from my hand. 
 I'm from the home where the speed the wind is the big apple 
 Came down the south build the beach and a new castle 
 Every day I'm hustling and every day you hustle, 
 Doing what you can't and I'm doing what I have to, 
 From me in the jungle and I'll show you I'm a winner, 
 I'm coming out with dinner we're wearing the chinchilla, 
 I did it for my town to show 'em the big picture, 
 Hit the switch, I promise to never switch up, 
 This is for my brother ... went to jail, 
 I'm sending all the pictures and of my shows to the mall 
 He hit me with a letter, I know you never fail, 
 So put me on a beach with a pocket in the pail 
 So you tried to believe in the castles made of the sand 
 When it falls to the sea and your fear can't find ... 
 Each from my hand, each from my hand.
