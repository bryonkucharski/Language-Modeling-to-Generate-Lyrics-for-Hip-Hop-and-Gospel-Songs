 That's right, Armando Christian Perez 
 And when it comes to that pretty little beauty, cutie 
 Don't stop, get it, get it baby, let me pay it 
 I got that wild love 
 Love to get wild, dirty, freaky, nasty, yeah I said it 
 I'll make you lose your heart and your mind at the same time 
 Don't believe me, bet it 
 I'm obsessed with that wild love for sure 
 Even though it's a kiss one to two 
 It's a gift and curse for sure 
 But baby you know that you love it too, that's why 
 You need it, you want it 
 All over your body 
 This loving I'm giving 
 It's worth more than money 
 You need it, you want it 
 All over your body 
 I know that you want this 
 Wild, wild, love
