This is for all the woman that has been stripped of their innocents. 
 She was Daddy's Little Girl.

 All alone in the world.

 I was raised by woman, a woman made me a man 
 It just to bad that a man, took her innocents 
 And god knows that I will feel the shame 
 Commit the shame end up killin' him 
 Blame it on the ignorents that's were her childhood went 
 No country no langues that's how 7 years was spent 
 Turn's you can't deny it and someone they don't hear 
 I know that we bump beds, just know Mom Dad I'm here

 And that was to be.

 Took care of me, just like a mother 
 Till you got pregnent, then there was all the tortyre 
 He was tough but we but we was borded tougher for you cause you had no father 
 Know I understand know then I'm a man 
 How much a woman needs someone to call Dad 
 You cut through the pain, you walked through the rain 
 The game ain't played you, baby you played the game 
 Now you're in surch of that father figure 
 If you find him he deny he didn't fucked that 
 Come as a bitch even though I know she wished 
 She was Daddy's Little Girl.

 This for all the woman who stayed strong and beat all the audience 
 The ones that have been raped or grew up father less 
 But still found a way to raise their kids to do the right thing 
 This for y'all, I love y'all.
