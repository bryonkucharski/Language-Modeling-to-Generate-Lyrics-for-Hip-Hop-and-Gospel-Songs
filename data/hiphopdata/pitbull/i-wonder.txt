(Intro - oobie) 
 Everytime I see you, you're tryna' to take me home 
 And it makes me wonder, if we were to get it on 
 Would you take the time to touch me (touch me) 
 And take me into ecstasy yeah 
 (Chorus - oobie) 
 And I wonder if I take you home 
 Would you give me good love baby 
 Would you fulfill my fantasies 
 Or would you just do me wrong (would you just do me wrong) 
 I wonder if I take you home 
 Would you give me good love baby 
 Would you fulfill my fantasies 
 Or would you just do me wrong (would you just do me wrong) 
 (Verse 1 - pitbull) 
 Mami what's up wit ya' 
 I just wanna get to know you better 
 Mami you tight work 
 And I know I could get you wetter 
 I know you hear this a lot 
 And I know you fed up 
 I know life is hard 
 But you gotta keep ya' head up 
 You got the real game, check 
 Nail game, check 
 Hair game, check 
 Everything, check 
 That's why I can't wait to slip off your clothes 
 And lick you from head to toe 
 And give you some of this fire head till you explode 
 I wanna make you cum till you can't cum no more (ay, que rico) 
 I wanna see you girl, roll your toes (ay, que rico) 
 I wanna be the one to turn you out (ay, que rico) 
 I'ma show you what I be about 
 I'm not a hot boy, I'm a hot man 
 That'll eat yo' ass, till you say god damn 
 Girl I love this 
 And if you think you got some undefeated Tyson pussy 
 Bitch I'm Buster Douglas 
 (Chorus - oobie) 
 And I wonder if I take you home 
 Would you give me good love baby 
 Would you fulfill my fantasies 
 Or would you just do me wrong (would you just do me wrong) 
 I wonder if I take you home 
 Would you give me good love baby 
 Would you fulfill my fantasies 
 Or would you just do me wrong (would you just do me wrong) 
 (Verse 2 - pitbull) 
 I wanna be that man, that you've, never had before 
 I wanna be that man, that'll put it on you fast and slow 
 I wanna be, everything that you need baby and more 
 It would be no fun, if I told you everything that's in store 
 You've got those body parts, I just wanna explore 
 Como me vuelves loco, ven paca mi amor 
 You got my two boys, below my waistline, singing the blues 
 Tell me baby, honestly, what is it exactly you got to lose 
 Nothing at all, except climbin the walls (ay, que rico) 
 Don't lie you know you want some more (ay, que rico) 
 I'ma have you going crazy, praising the lord (ay, que rico) 
 I fuck like I rap, hardcore 
 I'm not a hot boy, I'm a hot man 
 That'll eat yo' ass, till you say god damn 
 Girl I love this 
 And if you think you got some undefeated Tyson pussy 
 Bitch I'm Buster Douglas 
 (Chorus - oobie) 
 And I wonder if I take you home 
 Would you give me good love baby 
 Would you fulfill my fantasies 
 Or would you just do me wrong (would you just do me wrong) 
 I wonder if I take you home 
 Would you give me good love baby 
 Would you fulfill my fantasies 
 Or would you just do me wrong (would you just do me wrong) 
 And I wonder if I take you home 
 Would you give me good love baby 
 Would you fulfill my fantasies 
 Or would you just do me wrong 
 And I wonder if I take you home 
 Would you give me good love baby 
 Would you fulfill my fantasies 
 Or would you just do me wrong
