I wear my heart upon my sleeve, for you to see 
 (Mr. Worldwide) 
 I don't care what they believe we should be 
 (Leona Lewis) 
 I won't run away 'cause I can't change how I feel 
 This is for those that never believed in what we got goin' on 
 We don't have to say a single thing about you and me 
 (We appreciate y'all) 
 We could be the only ones, only ones to know 
 (Sing it to 'em, Leona) 
 We could be the only ones, only ones to know 
 (Let's ride) 
 We could be the only (only, only) ones to know 
 We could be the only (only, only) ones to know 
 I see you baby (Yeah) 
 I wanna feel you baby (Yeah) 
 Sexy to hear you baby 
 Just keep your lips like the Navy, and seal them baby 
 I live a life that movies are made of 
 Sex, money, power and mayhem 
 These boys ain't' players, they need to get their game up 
 They can't even hit a lay up 
 Forget the Facebook, forget the Twitter 
 Forget the Snapchat, forget the Instagram 
 Baby I got a master plan 
 Gingerbread man, catch me if you can 
 We could be the only ones, only ones to know 
 We could be the only ones, only ones to know 
 We could be the only (only, only) ones to know 
 We could be the only (only, only) ones to know 
 Baby let's get away and enjoy paradise together 
 And if you understand my vision 
 Then we could knuckle up and take on the world together 
 I've lived this life forever 
 No one has to know how we move 
 No one has to know what we do 
 Just me and you 
 Just you and I 
 Bonnie and Clyde 
 Step on the gas, let's ride 
 Forget the Facebook, forget the Twitter 
 Forget the Snapchat, forget the Instagram 
 Baby I got a master plan 
 Gingerbread man, catch me if you can 
 We could be the only ones, only ones to know 
 We could be the only ones, only ones to know 
 We could be the only (only, only) ones to know 
 We could be the only (only, only) ones to know 
 They're mad 
 Because they can't do the things that we can 
 And they never been the places we've been 
 That's right, all they do is talk shh... 
 They're mad 
 Because they can't do the things that we can

 That's right, all they do is talk shh... 
 We could be the only (only, only) ones to know 
 We could be the only (only, only) ones to know 
 We could be the only (only, yeah) ones to know 
 We could be the only (only, only, only) ones to know
