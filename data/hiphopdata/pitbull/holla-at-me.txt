(Khaled) 
 This is... This is 
 This is... AND HE GOES BY THE NAME OF 
 (Lil Wayne) 
 Yeah you got the right one, It's Weezy Fuckin' Baby 
 And if your woman lookin', I'll let the woman taste me 
 Okay now I'm with Khaled, we wilyn in Miami 
 We got a bunch of bitches, we pile 'em in the phantom 
 They follow us to Mansion but I don't mean the club 
 I'm talking bout my crib, mama I'm trying to fuck 
 It's Cash Money Baby, It's Young Money Biatch 
 Now you can swallow that or you can suck a dick 
 Okay, tell me shit, Lil Wayne fuck a bitch 
 Lil' nigga, big money, big gun full of that shit 
 Nigga I ain't Will Smith, Nah, I ain't a fresh prince 
 Nigga I'm a young king, Nigga I'm a Bun B 
 Yup, I go hard, ask my broad 
 Miss Stevie Wonder, she ain't lookin' at y'all (She can't see) 
 The rest goes without me having to say 
 I say, go, go, go, go (DJ) 
 (Chorus: Paul Wall) 
 Holla at me, What it do, What it is 
 You ain't never seen a playa like this (Holla at me baby) 
 I'm a pimp, I'll show her how I live 
 Take her back then I put it in her wrist (Holla at me baby) 
 I'm a monster, I do it real big 
 You ain't never seen rocks like this (Holla at me baby) 
 You can see me from a far I'm the shit 
 Scream at me What it do, What it is (What It Do) 
 (Paul Wall) 
 It's Paul Wall baby, Swishahouse club rocker 
 Chunk a deuce, sip a deuece, pourin up big goose vodka 
 Lone star beast straight up out the H 
 Sure stoppin' all the hate, sippin on the ski taste 
 I got the I-N-S on my tail, immigration still harass 
 'Cause they see me in a foreign ridin' on a pointed glass 
 Gettin' cash is my number one task 
 Until I'm under the grass, that's why I'm top of the class 
 I'm a grit boy lookin' for an ass like Ketoya 
 Leave a bitch back all nutty like Almond Joy 
 My boy Toy I E got to sleep 
 And we got to see and who got the freaks? 
 Beat it up like an ass whipping 
 The album dropped and there's been a lot of ass kissing 
 But I ain't trippin', I'm trill 
 That's why I'm posted with Khaled 'cause he real one 
 A hundred baby like a bill, Holla at me baby 
 (Fat Joe) 
 Nah homie, you done got it fucked up 
 You ain't got as much money as us (Nope) 
 We sent Campbell in 'cause he got goggles on 
 And he's pushing something far and it's fucked 
 Now all I gotta do is push a little button quick fast 
 And the chopper come out of the stash 
 Yeah money ain't jewels motherfucker you lose 
 I'll make you do the Fuck Sean Comb dance (Follow me now) 
 Who wanna come test the kid 
 Have your baby mama bless the team 
 Shit, I ain't even know she could twerk it like that 
 She a motherfuckin sex machine, Holla at me baby 
 (Rick Ross) 
 Stuntin in a magnum ridin' with my hat low 
 Forty-five magnum, barrel full of air holes 
 Dade County, represent, Dopeboy ever since 
 Know that I'ma veteran, Million dollar president 
 Rick Ross, big chips, AK's, flip clips 
 Off set rims on a rear six inch lips 
 Started on the benches, rose through the trenches 
 Now I'm the shit bitch, go and check your senses 
 Known for the benz's, Chrome on the bentleys 
 Smokin' on the mentleys, Dade county, big cheese 
 Flip soft, whip that, Rick Ross rip that 
 Khaled go hard dawg, talk to 'em Paul Wall 
 (Pitbull) 
 It's Mr. 3-0-5 A.K.A 
 Mr. Snort yay, spit rocks, made in day 
 I owe my future to 
 Last name Campbell, first name Luther 
 The gun shine stayed, well that shoulda 
 Bought him the crib, what it do, what it is 
 Bust a clip, flip a brick, hey buddy where's the lick? 
 That's all we talk about, well welcome to the south 
 We in, get our bread then we out, no doubt 
 Harlas and priests 
 These boys dirty, they'll fuck your mother, sister, daughter and nieces 
 Oye da loca, mueve a la carada, oye da loca, even la meraya (?)
