 Girl, my body don't lie (RedOne) 
 I'm outta my mind 
 Let it rain over me 
 I'm rising so high 
 Outta my mind (Marc Anthony) 
 So let it rain over me (WHOOOO-HOOOO!!!!!) 
 Ay ay ay

 Let it rain over me (WHOOOO-HOOOO!!!!!) 
 Pitbull 
 A billion's the new million 
 Voli's the new vodka 
 40's the new 30 
 And baby, you're a rockstar 
 Dale veterana, que tu sabe 
 Mas de la cuenta, no te hagas 
 Teach me baby or better yet, 
 Freak me baby, yes, yes 
 I'm freaky, baby 
 Imma make sure that your peach feels peachy, baby 
 No bougie broads, I like my women sexy, classy, sassy 
 Powerful yes, that love to get a little nasty ow 
 This ain't a game you'll see, you can put the blame on me 
 Dale munequita abra alli, and let it rain over me

 A billion's the new million 
 Voli's the new vodka 
 Latin's the new majority, ya tu sabe 
 Next step la casa blanca 
 No hay carro, nos vamos en balsa 
 Mami you know the drill, they will know what I got 'til they read the will 
 I ain't trying, I ain't trying to keep it real 
 I'm trying to keep wealth and that's for real 
 Pero mira que tu estas buena, y mira que tu estas dura 
 Baby no me hables mas, y tirame lo mami chula 
 No games you'll see, you can put the blame on me 
 Dale munequita abra alli, and let it rain over me
