 We've been around the world, say ain't so 
 Work hard, play hard, all day long 
 All the continents get jealous over me 
 You can see me 3D overseas 
 If you know me then you know where to find me 
 Off to the Bahamas with the play room behind me 
 Now live it up, live it up, live it up 
 Baby pick it up, pick it up, pick it up 
 And we gon' 
 Boom boom around the world 
 Boom boom no kidding girl

 Well I've been patiently waiting for you to shake and shake it 
 Make it or take it 
 The point is we made it 
 Quarter by the game, call us Tom Brady 
 And it's not our fault that we have all the ladies 
 But it's hard to see these ladies when your middle name's Equator 
 All around the globe, matter fact see your later 
 They're great, we're great at world war, dominators 
 And we're also some smooth operators, and we gon' 
 Boom boom around the world 
 Boom boom no kidding girl 
 Boom boom

 Live it up (Live it up), don't let life live you (Live you) 
 It's a good time (Good time), so we give you (Give you) 
 Now live it up, live it up, live it up
