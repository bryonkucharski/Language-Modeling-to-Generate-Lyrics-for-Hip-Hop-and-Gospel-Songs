I tell the truth even when I lie 
 Take a deep look in my eyes 
 All you know and see is fine 
 Let's wake up the world, let's ride, dale 
 Wake me up in the morning 
 Slow me down in the evening 
 Get me whatever you want to make me feel alive 
 Wake me up in the morning 
 Slow me down in the evening 
 Get me whatever you want to make me feel alive 
 I'm so 3000 and great, they're so 2000 and hate 
 They want me to fall and fail 
 Hurry up and wait, I'm a pyscho on a beat 
 Norman bates, I'm on that bally, as well, as the fire great legs, break 
 Five, six, seven, eight, I'm some like a pimp, when I put my words on a track, slap 
 Hussle, hussle, hard, grind, I'm known for that, slap 
 Hussle, business, manager, and now he's a business man 
 That chico got more flips than gymnist man 
 Who is the man? chip chip bang 
 Wake me up in the morning 
 Slow me down in the evening 
 Get me whatever you want to make me feel alive 
 Wake me up in the morning 
 Slow me down in the evening 
 Get me whatever you want to make me feel alive 
 Let's get it like it, automatic 
 Space invader, dancfloor operator 
 Supersonic, elevator, next level, upgrader 
 Take you higher, margin later, right now not later 
 I feel alive baby, I feel alive in this club 
 I feel alive baby, I feel alive in this club 
 I feel alive baby, I feel alive in this club 
 I feel alive, feel alive 
 Wake me up in the morning 
 Slow me down in the evening 
 Get me whatever you want to make me feel alive 
 Wake me up in the morning 
 Slow me down in the evening 
 Get me whatever you want to make me feel alive 
 I be going faster, and faster 
 Better make it last, make it last yeah 
 I be going faster, and faster 
 Better make it last, make it last now baby 
 Wake me up in the morning 
 Slow me down in the evening 
 Get me whatever you want to make me feel alive 
 Wake me up in the morning 
 Slow me down in the evening 
 Get me whatever you want to make me feel alive 
 I feel alive baby 
 I feel alive baby 
 I feel alive baby now I feel great
