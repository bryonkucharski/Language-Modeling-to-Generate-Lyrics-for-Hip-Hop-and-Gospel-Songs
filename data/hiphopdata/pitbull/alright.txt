It's alright, you walked up on back of me and it's so tight 
 No space to move up in here but the vibes nice 
 We don't really care what nobody say 
 We come to ride my jeep, we come to break away 
 It's alright, I've been watching you, baby, all night 
 The way you move your body is so right 
 And I just want to say 
 Hey, hey, baby, what's your name? 
 Hey, hey, baby, what's your name? 
 It's alright, it's okay 
 We gon' party all night and drink all day 
 It's alright, it's okay 
 We gon' party all night and drink all day 
 Perry Marshall came to take over the world 
 If you don't believe me just watch us 
 God bless Haiti and just like Haitians 
 It takes more than earthquakes to stop us 
 What don't kill you make you stronger 
 And there's nothing that can feed this hunger 
 We gon' keep coming with the heat 
 Skippity do wop and flip the beat 
 Pit got this, watch this, you sound monotonous 
 Stop this, I already told you, not this 
 Hey Miss, you me, me you 
 You and I tonight, alright? 
 It's alright, you walked up on back of me and it's so tight 
 No space to move up in here but the vibes nice 
 We don't really care what nobody say 
 We come to ride my jeep, we come to break away 
 It's alright, I've been watching you, baby, all night 
 The way you move your body is so right 
 And I just want to say 
 Hey, hey, baby, what's your name? 
 Hey, hey, baby, what's your name? 
 It's alright, it's okay 
 We gon' party all night and drink all day 
 It's alright, it's okay 
 We gon' party all night and drink all day 
 Shake up your body now it's alright 
 Wind up your body 'cause it's okay 
 Jump up and down and do what you like 
 Work up yourself and go crazy 
 Drink what we want and do it all night 
 Party don't stop 'til the break of day 
 Pump up the music, turn up the lights 
 Swing it, don't stop until we say 
 Girl get fine and wind up your bomba 
 Boy, wind up like you don't care 
 Back in time, now rev up the bomba 
 Love, all the man, them balling 
 It's alright, you walked up on back of me and it's so tight 
 No space to move up in here but the vibes nice 
 We don't really care what nobody say 
 We come to ride my jeep, we come to break away 
 It's alright, I've been watching you, baby, all night 
 The way you move your body is so right 
 And I just want to say 
 Hey, hey, baby, what's your name?
