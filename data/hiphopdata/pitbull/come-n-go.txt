(Enrique Iglesias) 
 I make the girls come! 
 I make the girls go! 
 (Pitbull) 
 I've been around the world, and there 
 Seen a little bit of everything 
 Heard the la, learned the la, on how to hit the spot, ding, ding, ding 
 And if the price is right, I mean the night is right, I mean the time is right 
 So do her thing, and I know the price, night, and time is right 
 So dimelo mami, don't play no games 
 Dale mama, talk to me straight 
 Please, please no chase 
 Now this isn't the debate, and I ain't even chase 
 Mami you're the internet, and I'm looking for a download 
 And if you don't know, now you know 
 Yeah, I make them come and go 
 (Enrique Iglesias) 
 I make the girls come!

 I make the girls go!

 Make them go-o-o 
 I make them come, make them come

 Now you heard about me, and I ain't gotta say much 
 I ain't talking about cars, it's automatic and pop your clutch 
 You gon' do things baby, you never done before 
 And you will say things baby, you never said before 
 You will think us baby, you never thought you did 
 This is SY shot, turn those cans, so baby don't blame 
 Mami you're the internet, and I'm looking for a download 
 And if you don't know, now you know 
 Yeah, I make them come and go
