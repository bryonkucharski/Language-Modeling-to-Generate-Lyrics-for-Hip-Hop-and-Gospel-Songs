Eh 
 Wyclef with Pitbull 
 The clubs ain't safe tonight 
 (Wyclef) 
 Mamacita so nice to meet ya 
 You drunk off that rum 
 You shouldn't drive tonight 
 Give me the key to that beemer 
 She looked at me and laughed 
 Started shakin her ass 
 She said her brother just came home 
 From the jungle 
 (Pitbull) 
 It's a jungle sometimes 
 It makes me wonder 
 How I keep from goin' under 
 With all these around me 
 I got 'em all colors, shapes and sizes 
 I'm in over my head, these women gone drown me 
 Spike Lee was definitely talkin' 'bout me when he made that movie 'Jungle Fever' 
 'Cause I like 'em a little bit darker 
 Take it from the back to the front, Rosa Parkuh 
 But to tell you the truth, it makes no difference 
 As long as they know what they doin' when it's time to get busy 
 We can take it from the floor to the bed from the bed to the kitchen 
 Coffee with no cream 
 That's like a rock with no fiend 
 Martin Luther King with no dream 
 John Lennon Couldn't even imaging such a thing 
 And for those that don't know nothin' 
 Welcome to the jungle 
 'Clef tell 'em somethin' 
 (Wyclef)

 COMO?! 
 If you got that hot blood 
 Esto es pa' la gente con sangre caliente 
 Turn around now back up 
 Preparate mujer que mi lengua es de fuego 
 Morenita que rica esta 
 She don't speak Spanish, Aii mama 
 That's cool 'cause I'll put the Spanish in ya 
 And by the end of the night you'll say aii papa 
 I'm that chico that got a fetish with women 
 Light skin red bones they blow my mind 
 I'm that chico that'll get 'em and hit em 
 Now all of a sudden they wanna be mine 
 Stop playin' with me 
 Say it with me 
 Dale papi, dale papi oh 
 And for those that don't know nothin' 
 Welcome to the jungle 
 'Clef tell 'em somethin' 
 (Wyclef)

 It's that jungle fever 
 Fever 
 It's that jungle fever 
 Fever 
 Watch out watch out 
 It's that jungle fever 
 Fever 
 It's that jungle fever 
 Fever 
 It's that jungle fever 
 Fever 
 Watch out watch out 
 It's that jungle fever 
 (Pitbull) 
 Now what I'mma do is uh, explain this uh, jungle fever to y'all 
 This doesn't necessarily mean I like uh, dark women 
 Doesn't necessarily mean I don't like dark women 
 What it means is, uh: 
 To get nasty 
 To get freaky 
 To do things you've never done before 
 To act like an animal straight out the jungle, that's jungle fever 
 Whites, Black, Latin, Chinese, lo que sea 
 You know what I'm talkin' bout, right Clef?
