We gon' take it from the bottom 
 (M I A M I to Houston) 
 H-town, Pitbull, Bun B 
 My dogg Demi, keep ya head up, I gotchu, I promise 
 All my chicos, I gotchu, I promise 
 Miami, I gotchu, I promise 
 I'ma take over this bitch, I promise 
 So get ready mothafuckaz, this is not a game 
 (Eee, yoo, uuu) 
 I'm from the dirty, dirty, where a lot of these cats mix the weed 
 With the coke and blow dirty, we're off the chain meng 
 Rap game, crack game, cut it, cook it, chop it, record it 
 Album shop it, it's all the same thang 
 Y'all look at these blue skies and think paradise 
 I look at these blue skies and think what a disguise 
 That's why it's called the Magic City, it's a treat to your eyes 
 Cross the bridge and it'll fuck with ya mind 
 Word of advice, don't follow the streets, follow the signs 
 'Cause the last thing you wanna do is get lost 
 'Cause it might just cost ya life 
 Y'all heard about the smash and grabs 
 So watch where you put the map on the dash 
 'Cause they might end up clapping ya ass 
 Why you think the traffic lights, they blink at late night? 
 They don't want you to stop 'cause the streets'll be filled wit red stripes 
 Like Jamaican beer, we fry 'em like bacon here 
 Yo life'll get taken here, I just thought I should make it clear, yeah 
 Everything we do is dirty 
 We pull up in the drop, it's dirty 
 We pound that twat, dirty 
 Miami, we're dirty 
 Where they lace 'em, roll 'em 
 Smoke 'em and blow 'em dirty 
 Guns they hold 'em 
 If they clean dogg, we make 'em dirty 
 Everything we do is dirty 
 We pull up in the drop, it's dirty 
 We pound that twat, dirty 
 Miami, we're dirty 
 Where they lace 'em, roll 'em 
 Smoke 'em and blow 'em dirty 
 Guns they hold 'em 
 If they clean dogg, we make 'em dirty 
 Straight up outta Texas, the reckless, PA to be exact 
 Where the streets is cutthroat and fiends kill you for a G of crack 
 8 Gg's and Cadillacs, Chevys cut on the deltas 
 Might swang up on ya then hurt ya, nobody here gon' help ya 
 2000 heltah skelta, talking bout families and killers 
 Vicious like silver back guerrillas, see then peel ya 
 Niggaz down here ain't tryna feel ya, see ya, hear ya, know ya 
 Serve ya, for ya or for ya 
 (Feel it) 
 You pussy niggaz been hatin' on us for too long 
 So we finna prove you wrong, teach you hoes a new song 
 (That's what's up) 
 'Cause the time is now 
 (Now) 
 The place is here 
 (Here) 
 I could smell you scared nigga, I could taste your fear 
 Go make it clear and move the smoke outta yo eyes 
 So that when everything go down 
 It won't be no kind of surprise 
 And I got no time for yo lies 
 (No time for lies) 
 Save 'em for Peter 
 Just remember my name, I'm facing my heater 
 (Bitch) 
 Let's get it dirty 
 Everything we do is dirty 
 We pull up in the drop, it's dirty 
 We pound that twat, dirty 
 Miami, we're dirty 
 Where they lace 'em, roll 'em 
 Smoke 'em and blow 'em dirty 
 Guns they hold 'em 
 If they clean dogg, we make 'em dirty 
 Everything we do is dirty 
 We pull up in the drop, it's dirty 
 We pound that twat, dirty 
 Miami, we're dirty 
 Where they lace 'em, roll 'em 
 Smoke 'em and blow 'em dirty 
 Guns they hold 'em 
 If they clean dogg, we make 'em dirty 
 These boys from the bottom are obsessed with old school Chevys 
 We call 'em verts and donks, some we call box Chevys 
 Seven-duece, seven-trey, seven-four, seven-five 
 M I A M I till I die, 3 0 5 
 Candy paint and leather, they don't fuck wit nothing but dubs or better 
 Y'all call 'em street sweepers, we call 'em choppers 
 'Cause when the bullets spit they spin like helicopters 
 This city's filled with crooked coppers and crooked doctors 
 So how could these streets not be filled with crooked bitches? 
 And niggaz, cocaine cooking, brick flipping bitches, trippin' for figures 
 This Cuban has seen it, heard about it and lived it 
 That's why I spit it so vivid, you got it, I want it, you give it 
 This is for everybody in county, TGK 
 Metro West and Stockade doing time 
 And if you got more than 365 
 And you're up the road rep MIA with pride, that's right 
 Everything we do is dirty 
 We pull up in the drop, it's dirty 
 We pound that twat, dirty 
 Miami, we're dirty 
 Where they lace 'em, roll 'em 
 Smoke 'em and blow 'em dirty 
 Guns they hold 'em 
 If they clean dogg, we make 'em dirty 
 Everything we do is dirty 
 We pull up in the drop, it's dirty 
 We pound that twat, dirty 
 Miami, we're dirty 
 Where they lace 'em, roll 'em 
 Smoke 'em and blow 'em dirty 
 Guns they hold 'em 
 If they clean dogg, we make 'em dirty
