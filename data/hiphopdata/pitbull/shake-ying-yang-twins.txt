 My nigga Kaine 
 Up in the cut 
 Pouring it up 
 Rolling it up 
 Holding it up 
 Ain't her breasts swollen or what 
 Yes sir, yes sir 
 Oh, we gonna take it back like thieves and foes 
 Nasty as I want to be 
 That makes me too live for your crew 
 Ho get down get low 
 I'm crossin' these mama like tic-tac-toe 
 Let's ride, let's go 
 Get loose, get crunk, get drunk, get blown 
 That's right, let's roll 
 MIA ATL fo sho

 All the lil' mamas, all around the world 
 Shake that ass if you a nasty girl 
 Back that ass up says juvenile 
 Show a nigga some titties 
 Like girls gone wild 
 Tear off this clip of clothes 
 I want to see you in the nude 
 You can keep on your high heel shoes 
 So follow me down to yellow brick road 
 Where niggas go to see naked ho's 
 Shake that ass bitch 
 And be off in the club with a hard-ass dick 
 Then drop like this bitch 
 If you want to make the money 
 Shawty, work that shit 
 Put a hump in your back 
 And lick it raw 
 To a three point stance 
 But you mess up yo ass 
 You must be on that Kayne work out plan 
 Like head shoulders knees ho's 
 Shake, shake, just shake, shake 
 Just shake, shake 
 Just shake chica, shake, shake 
 Shake, shake, just shake, shake 
 Just shake, shake 
 Just shake chica, shake, shake

 Take 'em out and cruise 
 Take 'em out all dressed 
 Is the realest true niggas in the ATL 
 Yeah, we break it down 
 Better shake a booty ho 
 And them ho's 
 And the girl with the real tight clothes 
 One time for the gang with the Ying Yang twins 
 We already know we off the reel 
 Don't tolerate that talkin' 
 Bitch you can get to walkin' 
 Patrollers is where I'm groaking 
 The only way that we are talkin' 
 If your breath smells like mine 
 Girls don'are give a fuck 'cause you fine 
 I diss 'em fo I kiss 'em 
 I pack 'em fo I stack 'em 
 So while we in the club 
 Betta get these girls 
 'Cause on the streets there ain't no action 
 Shake, shake, just shake, shake 
 Just shake, shake 
 Just shake chica, shake, shake 
 Shake, shake, just shake, shake 
 Just shake, shake 
 Just shake chica, shake, shake
