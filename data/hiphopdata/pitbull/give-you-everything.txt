Me not working hard? 
 Yeah right picture that with a kodak 
 And better yet, go to times square 
 Take a picture of me with a kodak 
 Took my life from negative to positive 
 And I just want y'all know that 
 And tonight, let's enjoy life 
 Tonight I will love love you tonight 
 Give me everything tonight 
 For all we know we might not get tomorrow 
 Let's do it tonight 
 I will love love you tonight 
 Give me everything tonight 
 For all we know we might not get tomorrow 
 Let's do it tonight 
 Don't care what they say 
 All the games they play 
 Nothing is enough 
 Till they handle love (Let's do it tonight) 
 I want you tonight, I want you today 
 I want you tonight 
 Grab somebody sexy tell 'em hey 
 Give me everything tonight 
 Give me everything tonight 
 Give me everything tonight 
 Give me everything tonight 
 Get busy tonight 
 'Cause to more and more to do bad before and for Prius 
 Desperate tonight 
 I can make you my queen 
 And make love to you eanless 
 This is insane, the way the name growin', money keep flowin' 
 Hustlers move aside, so I'm tiptoein, keep flowin' 
 I gotta locked up like Lindsay Lohan 
 Put it on my life baby 
 I can make you feel right baby 
 I can't promise tomorrow 
 But I promise tonight 
 Excuse me 
 But I might drink a little bit more than I should tonight 
 And I might take you home with me if I could tonight 
 And I think you should let me 'cause I look good tonight 
 And we might not get tomorrow 
 Tonight I will love love you tonight 
 Give me everything tonight 
 For all we know we might not get tomorrow 
 Let's do it tonight 
 I will love love you tonight 
 Give me everything tonight 
 For all we know we might not get tomorrow
