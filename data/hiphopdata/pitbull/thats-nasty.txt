 Picture me, pullin' up in the truck on twenty fo's 
 I'm like spinnas, the quicker you stop the faster I go 
 Don't mess wit' us, ('cause) we quick to cock back and unload 
 This Pitbull, for those that don't know 
 All my chicos in the south that's been puttin' it down puttin' in work 
 Bitches been turnin' them out, snitches get put in the dirt 
 Pit's been chillin' in the bottom wit' no deals 
 If them boys talk a lot then they no reals 
 Shimmy y'all shimmy yam shimmy ya 
 Catch me wit' Piccolo riding on them thangs ah 
 See the south is known for ridin' high 
 'Cause they ride high on twenty fo's and they smoke and drive 
 Everybody wanna know where's Pitbull from, what has Pitbull done? 
 I've done enough to have these bitches fiendin' for Pitbull's cum 
 So when you see me on them tewnty fo's spinning 
 You know they cut me a serious check 
 But for now I'm still grindin' fiending for a lickin' 
 That's some serious shit (Woo!) yeah

 (Pitbull) 
 I'm from the land where you name it everything's crooked 
 Watch what you do 'cause, everything's looking 
 Man these streets got ears and eyes 
 And they wanna know it all - who, what, where's, and why's 
 Everybody wanna know is Pitbull really ridin' twenty fo's 
 Everybody wanna know if his rims spin, you know how it goes 
 These streets don't just talk, they gossip like Oprah 
 Right now I ain't got a damn thang 
 But the day I get some rims, they'll either spin, chop, or poke ya 
 When the barrel spin, like the fiend with the rock I smoked ya 
 On top of the game shit, one day I hope ta 
 But for now I'm tryin' ta get y'all hooked like that coca-ine-a 
 Don't start no shit dawg, won't be none 
 And other than jigga a lot of these rappers? Dawg, I don't see none 
 So when you see me on them twenty fo's spinning 
 You know they cut me a serious check 
 But for now I'm still grindin' fiending for a lickin' 
 That's some serious shit (Woo!) yeah 
 Twenty fo's on my truck that's nasty (Woo!) 
 They spin when you stop that's nasty (Woo!) 
 Twenty fo's on my truck that's nasty (Woo!)

 If you pump it ima dislocate your soul from the streets 
 Remember me lil' g A-town to the O (Ooh)

 Is ya hatin' 'cause my cup got rhinestones in it? 
 Is ya hatin' 'cause my twenty fo's keep spinnin'? 
 G's up and whatever else down!

 Lay it down loud, (it'll) get ya shot to the head 
 But y'all want ya conversation, I just want yo' bread
