 This is for them boys on there way to Tennessee listening to M.J.G 
 Breaking dem birds and 8-balls 
 Be careful with them keys 
 Don't hesitate to squeeze 
 Watch out for them feds 'cause they hate y'all 
 Bank accounts overseas 
 When them feds come for me all they goin' find is C-D's no weight dog 
 But wait dog 
 'Cause Pit is back, bigger badder stronger its all right you can hate dog 
 But don't be surprised if a chico do you like 
 They can escape then blow your motherfuckin' face off 
 Who the fuck wanna face off 
 'Cause I'm willing and ready to cock, aim and bang 
 Show the world what it means to be born and raised 
 In the home of the 'Canes that's the county of Dade 
 Well they used to shoot straight phase now they shoot A-K's 
 So if they kick in your door I suggest you do what they say 
 These are the facts of life minus them three bitches 
 They don't rap no more 
 All they do is snitchin' 
 I went from no pot to piss in 
 To gettin' taught how to whip up a pot in the kitchen 
 Listen 
 Cook Cook whip whip chop chop oh 
 Hear the shots don't look stop drop roll 
 Hit the block tell them fiends stop cop go 
 Used to be my life but not no more 
 Fuck em, hop in the bucket and haul ass 
 Fuck em, hop in the bucket and haul ass 
 Fuck em, hop in the bucket and haul ass 
 Fuck em, hop in the bucket and haul ass

 How you want it? how yella? or light brown 
 I Feel like Method Man I got him feenin' with they pipes out 
 Let's ride out and reminisce on them days 
 When dey used to jack tourists everyday in Dade 
 That's how J-T Money got his name 
 Miami all it equals is tons of cocaine 
 This is what we grew up and 
 Learned to do 
 These cubans'll teach you 'bout a bird or two 
 Keep acting like these boys won't murder you 
 Down here the sun ain't the only thing burning you 
 This where the bitches go two ways 
 Niggas love gun play 
 And a triangle equals a one way 
 If you know what I'm talking bout then you from Dade 
 If you don't then welcome to where I been raised 
 The bottom 
 Welcome to where I been raised 
 The crib 
 Welcome to where I been raised 
 Magic city 
 Welcome to where I been raised 
 305 County of Dade
