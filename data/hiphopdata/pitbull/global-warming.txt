Up in this a new million 
 You heard me, Sensato 
 It's Mr. Worldwide 
 Y El mundo helpatio 
 Let my dreams y'all dormant 
 Category 6's are stormin 
 Take this as a, take this as a warning 
 Welcome to, welcome to global warming 
 I'm tired of this rap shit 'cause all they do is rap shit 
 About coke shit, crack shit, click clack shit 
 But they never sold coke crack or click clack shit 
 That's why I'm laughing to the bang, ha-ha bitch 
 Private jets, I'm on that mile high shit 
 Without Denver, I'm going to November 
 Earth, wind, fire, I'm all for September 
 George Lopez puto, you remember 
 Now I'm stalked by bankers and lenders 
 Fuck these fake sugar ass niggas Splenda 
 I see your game, your plan, your agenda 
 They'll push your shit way back to Nintendo 
 No Facebook, Twitter or Instagram 
 I do it for the paper, I'm a business man 
 If you get it that's cool 
 It's all about the billionaires baby, welcome to the new school 
 Al banco voy a abrirle una cuenta 
 Pa' meterle miles miles y matarile 
 I get's money, en mi bloque hay misiles 
 Hay que comprarle chemises y zapatos bien reptiles 
 It's all about them billionaires 
 I'm so fucking serious 
 Look, I love them zeros, they looking like Cheerios 
 Monty like her period, y'all niggas gotta hurry up 
 My team is in your area, regando la epidemia 
 Tengo una novia Albania, blanquita macademia 
 Estoy enfermo de leucemia 
 Y'all bronkers got anemia 
 So if you get it that's cool 
 It's all about them billionaires baby, 
 Welcome to the new school
