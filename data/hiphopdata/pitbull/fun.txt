 Chris Brown, you set it off 
 Chris 
 Oh, feeling crazy 
 The moon is up, the night is hazy 
 Let's get lost in the shadows 
 Somewhere we can go and no one else can find 
 Lose 'em everybody baby come undone 
 Lose 'em everybody baby come undone 
 Lose 'em everybody baby come undone 
 Lose 'em everybody baby come undone 
 Oh my mind, looking like a good good time 
 Don't disguise the way you wanna love tonight 
 Oh my mind, hook you with a brand new high 
 Don't be shy, I just wanna live tonight 
 Have a little F.U.N, fun

 Fresh from Monaco, performing for Microsoft 
 Miami to L.A., G4, we takin' off 
 I'm a hard worker, I'm far from the boss 
 But when it's said and done, I'm owning it all 
 I know you think it's just rap 
 Just this, just that, haha right 
 Now baby, this my life 
 Wanna have fun for a night? Then just

 Don't disguise the way you wanna love tonight 
 Oh my mind, hook you with a brand new high 
 Don't be shy, I just wanna live tonight 
 Have a little F.U.N, fun
