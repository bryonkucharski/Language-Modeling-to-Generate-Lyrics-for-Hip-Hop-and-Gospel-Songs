Pitbull Intro 
 Drop, They thought he was done dawg, 
 But he's back bigger, better, stronger and free, 
 Like I ain't fought my way out of all these muthafuckin' situations, 
 Watch this. 
 Pitbull 
 I'm here to remind y'all, just in case you forgot, 
 Mr. 305 no label stay hot, 
 38 choppers, but please no glock, 
 Used to move work but had no drop, no block, no spot, 
 Mah was cool with the work, but no rocks, 
 Until she found my first nickel rock bag, 
 Said I had enough of this shit wit'cha dad, 
 Told me to get the fuck out the pad, 
 I was out to my first baby mama's crib, 
 Caught her fuckin' round off to abuelas crib, 
 Thank god for music my savior, 
 That's what helped me fight Xavier, 
 Don't believe these rappers and what they playin' 
 I wanna be owner, fuck a player, shit better said it, 
 I am an owner, bitch! Fuck a player.

 I got the city on my back & I won't surrender, 
 Let 'em know now that they gon' remember, 
 City on my back and I won't surrender, 
 Let 'em know now that they gon' remember, 
 They don't know what I got into 
 They don't know everything I been through 
 They don't know what it takes to get through 
 They don't know, they don't know. 
 Pitbull Chorus 
 My life, pain, struggle, hustle, grind, them boys knock me down, you must be out yo' fuckin' mind, 
 My Mom taught me to fight, 
 Dade county raised me right, 
 And we gon' take over this thing, put down my fuckin' life. 
 Pitbull 
 Don't call it a come back, I've been here for years, 
 Grindin' blood, sweat and tears. 
 I don' gave the game my life, 
 I've turned the streets from my bitch to my wife, 
 Every mornin' I woke up to the same shit, 
 Everybody sayin' that I ain't shit, 
 Them boys in the streets on that hate shit, 
 Them boys on the same street, same block doin' that same shit, 
 Planned to move bricks, but it's 8 balls, 
 Y'all want me, I hate y'all but I ate y'all, y'all can stay with Rillas and Apes, 
 I'm on my way to the show, gettin' paid, marvelous rates, 
 You the ace I'm the spade, 
 Cut cut Dade, where they buck buck spray, this ain't a duck duck goose, 
 This duck duck hey, press luck get duct taped ASAP okay!

 I got the city on my back and I won't surrender, 
 Let 'em know now that they gon' remember, 
 City on my back and I won't surrender, 
 Let 'em know now that they gon' remember, 
 They don't know what I got into 
 They don't know everything I been through 
 They don't know what it takes to get through 
 They don't know, they don't know.

 Avery Storm 
 Now you can stack the world against me, 
 Close the doors, I'll kick 'em in, 
 You could bet your life against me, 
 Bet your ass I'm gonna win, 
 You take that chance, you roll them dice, 
 I prove you wrong, you prove me right, 
 So damn what they say anyway.
