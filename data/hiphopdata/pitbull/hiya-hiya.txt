 Pitbull aka Christian great. 
 But please, baby you can call me 
 I make you fall in love. 
 I'm a thief with the heart. 
 To me it's an art. 
 Baby your eyes don't lie. 
 I can see you want a little bit of me. 
 In your life. 
 I can treat you like the princess you are. 
 But behind closed doors. 
 We can do it all. 
 Ladies first, when I open doors. 
 I got an open mind, let me open yours. 
 You can come see me while I'm on tour. 
 But until then, besitos mi amor. 
 Samha f dar ou jaya b alf khbar. 
 Ou ana aliha ma nkdaar.

 Watching you, watching me, 
 Watching you, watching me, 
 And I'ma give you want right, 
 Watching you, watching me, 
 Watching you, watching me, 
 And I'ma give you want right.
