I wanna go somewhere exotic 
 Let the summer search my body 
 Meet a sexy stranger in the lobby 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey 
 I wanna jump into the deep end 
 Get lucky like the number 7 
 Treat every day like a vacation 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey 
 I wanna see sexy beaches, hotels 
 I wanna see sexy beaches, hotels 
 Little mama wanna turn it up 
 Little mama wanna burn it up 
 Little mama wanna live it up 
 Well, little mama better give it up 
 And the mama is like wow 
 And the booty's like bang, bang, bang 
 I don't bring sand to the beach 
 Bring the beach to the sand 
 And I know what they want 
 And I know what they need 
 I just look'em in the eyes 
 And they're leaving with me 
 We will do all the wrong things 
 Wrong things you like 
 Baby, better do it tonight 
 Let's ride 
 I wanna go somewhere exotic 
 Let the summer search my body 
 Meet a sexy stranger in the lobby 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey 
 I wanna jump into the deep end 
 Get lucky like the number 7 
 Treat every day like a vacation 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey 
 I wanna see sexy beaches, hotels 
 I wanna see sexy beaches, hotels 
 You can't save me, babe, it's too late 
 I'm looking for a freak, not a soulmate 
 Sexy beaches, hotels 
 Mirrors on the roof 
 Making more fun - ain't that the truth 
 Whose on the world are not mine 
 I just aim that time 
 And bring a girlfriend 
 'Cause she's so damn fan 
 And I know what they want 
 And I know what they need 
 I just look'em in the eyes 
 And they're leaving with me 
 We will do all the wrong things 
 Wrong things you like 
 Baby, better gonna do it tonight 
 Let's ride 
 I wanna go somewhere exotic 
 Let the summer search my body 
 Meet a sexy stranger in the lobby 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey 
 I wanna jump into the deep end 
 Get lucky like the number 7 
 Treat every day like a vacation 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey 
 I wanna see sexy beaches, hotels 
 I wanna see sexy beaches, hotels 
 Sexy beaches, hotels 
 Sexy beaches, hotels
