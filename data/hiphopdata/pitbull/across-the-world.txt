(Talking: Pitbull) 
 Hey Jim (laugh) it's like these boys wanna make music for the block, yano, for they hood they city 
 I'm tryna make music for the world. You feel me, right, B.O.B.? 
 This is what we came up with 
 [Verse One] [Pitbull]: 
 I got up today and my flight was late 
 On my way to L.A. 
 I jumped up on a plane 
 And put on my shades 
 And threw on my headphones 
 I was vibin' to this beat 
 It made me move my feet 
 Boy that thang was sticky 
 And then I heard this melody 
 The dopest one I've ever seen, something out the usual 
 So Mr. Pilot, please 
 I think I got a hit on me, hurry to the studio 
 (Chorus] [B.O.B) 
 I'll play across the world 
 Across the world 
 Across the world 
 I'll play across the world 
 Across the world 
 Across the world 
 I'll play across the world 
 Oh 
 [Verse Two][B.O.B]: 
 Well I got up today 
 Put some gas in my tank 
 To make it to the studio 
 And then I heard this beat 
 It made me move my feet 
 Hell yeah that thang was super dope 
 And then I sang this melody 
 The dopest one I've ever seen 
 Something out the usual 
 So Mr. Engineer 
 Turn up the auto-tune 
 So I'll be on the radio (radio) 
 [Chorus][B.O.B]: 
 I'll play across the world 
 Across the world 
 Across the world 
 I'll play across the world 
 Across the world 
 Across the world 
 I'll play across the world 
 Oh 
 [Verse Three][Pitbull]: 
 Been around the world 
 Same old song 
 Now on stage they throw bras and thongs 
 Long way 
 From what I came from 
 Fightin' in the club just for sayin' somethin' 
 Now my passports full, I'm out of pages 
 New places, new faces 
 New fans, all ages 
 Black pink purple orange Caucasians 
 Latinos, Europeans, and Asians 
 In Japan they knew all my lyrics it was amazin' 
 They spoke Spanish: que mas carne, ni mas carne, asi viene sanwich 
 I guess it's true what they say 
 Music is the universal language 
 It's a true blessing you know? 
 To travel the globe... 
 [Chorus][B.O.B]: 
 I'll play across the world 
 Across the world 
 Across the world 
 I'll play across the world 
 Across the world 
 Across the world 
 I'll play across the world 
 Oh
