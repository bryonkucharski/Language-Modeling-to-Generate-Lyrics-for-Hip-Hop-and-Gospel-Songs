A couple of years. 
 And I'm gonna know your name. 
 It's like I waited for you forever. 
 And I know this might sound insane. 
 But it won't be long 
 Till we're gonna take this up. 
 What I'm talking about our future love. 
 You're so far away 
 And baby you're right next door. 
 Got me picturing your face again. 
 Something worth waiting for. 
 I put all others behind me. 
 They don't live up. 
 I know what I want what I need to the T. 
 Baby if they ask me. 
 I would say I don't even know your name. 
 And when they ask me, 
 Does it change? 
 No it don't change a thing. 
 'Cause it's something about the way you love me. 
 There's just something about the way you know me. 
 And I can't explain enough. 
 Just something about our future love future love future love. 
 Something about a future love future love future love. 
 Walking hand in hand. 
 Going on a second date. 
 I can picture how we're touching 
 And the kiss I can almost taste. 
 I imagine the all the ways. 
 We meet for the very first time. 
 I can see the place feel the love at first sight. 
 Baby if they ask me. 
 I would say I don't even know your name. 
 And when they ask me, 
 Does it change?

 We standing there like destiny. 
 When it feels like you're fighting just to breathe that's when you know. 
 The minute I pull up next to you. 
 Suddenly you don't know what to do 
 Everything inside you says that I'm the one.
