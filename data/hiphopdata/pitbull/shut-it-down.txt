Can't tell me nothin' now baby I know how to fly 
 Can't nothin' hold me down 
 I'm gon' to touch the sky 
 Can't nothin' nothin' hold me down, down 
 Can't nothin' nothin' hold me down, down 
 Can't nothin' nothin' hold me down 
 Now watch me, now watch me, now watch me shut this thing down 
 Sube sube, hasta las nubes, 
 Pa'lante, lante, no mires pa'tras 
 I hit the jackpot jack, 
 Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ching 
 Real peoples do real things on the road to get diamond rings 
 Moved up from the streets 
 Graduated hustla on it's way to a entrepreneur undefeated, Douglass Busta' 
 Now baby save me 
 From the game before it plays me 
 My life's a movie, call me Martin Scorsese 
 I can care less if you love me or hate me 
 Life's a bitch... now fuck you, pay me 
 Sube sube, hasta las nubes, 
 Pa'lante, lante, no mires pa'tras 
 Can't tell me nothin' now 
 Baby I know how to fly 
 Can't nothin' hold me down 
 I'm gon' touch the sky 
 Lose my money, honey 
 Now pay me what's you owe me 
 Mami's a hurricane you should see the way she blow me 
 I don't make it rain, I spit that global warmin' 
 This ain't no Biggie, ready to die, number five, there is no warnin' 
 Now baby, save me from the game before it plays me 
 My life's a movie, call me Martin Scorsese 
 I can care less if you love me or hate me 
 Life's a bitch... now fuck you, pay me 
 Sube sube, hasta las nubes, 
 Pa'lante, lante, no mires pa'tras 
 Can't nothin' hold me down 
 I'm gon' touch the sky 
 Can't tell me nothin' now 
 Baby, I know how to fly 
 Can't nothin' hold me down 
 I'm gon' touch the sky 
 Can't nothin' nothin' 
 Hold me down, down 
 Can't nothin' nothin' 
 Hold me down, down 
 Can't nothin' nothin' 
 Hold me down, 
 Now watch me, now watch me, now watch me shut this thing down 
 It's my life 
 Imma do what I do 
 And if you don't like it, it's cool, 
 Fuck you
