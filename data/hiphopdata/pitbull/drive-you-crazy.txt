Do you wanna ride baby 
 'Cause I don't mind driving you crazy 
 I heard you like to go fast girl 
 'Cause no, I don't run out of gas girl 
 So would you let me pull up to your bumper 
 In my new black car 
 Girl rev up your engine, I'll push start your ignition 
 Pull up to your bumper 
 In my new black car 
 Girl rev up your engine, I'll push start your ignition 
 And let's ride... baby 
 While I drive... you crazy 
 Let's ride... baby 
 While I drive... you crazy 
 Catch me on New Year's Eve, on Fox 
 Bringing that Miami Heat, white hot 
 She's like "papi, why you work so hard", why not? 
 That's not what she says when I'm working that box 
 Now ride baby, forget about the past and ride baby 
 Once you give it up, you'll be mine baby 
 Not on the first night, don't lie baby 
 'Cause girl I like it fast, you like it slow 
 Where I'm gonna take you, you never been before 
 Hit the gas until we lose control 
 You in for a wild ride 
 Do you wanna ride baby 
 'Cause I don't mind driving you crazy 
 I heard you like to go fast girl 
 'Cause no, I don't run out of gas girl 
 So would you let me pull up to your bumper 
 In my new black car 
 Girl rev up your engine, I'll push start your ignition 
 Pull up to your bumper 
 In my new black car 
 Girl rev up your engine, I'll push start your ignition 
 Ride it like a first class seat on a plane 
 Baby, go insane, make me remember your name 
 As we go up and down, roller coaster ride 
 Spread it open, let me go inside 
 Let me slide in between and park my stretch limousine 
 When I slap that ass, you soaking wet 
 Tonight's one night, that you won't forget 
 We tryna get a bone, let's play fetch, baby 
 I'm on deck like an old cassette 
 When I'm through, you gon' want you a souvenir 
 Stuff so good, make you shed a tear 
 With a smile on your face from ear-to-ear 
 And a tattoo that say "Juicy J was here." 
 'Cause girl I like it fast, you like it slow 
 Where I'm gonna take you, you never been before 
 Hit the gas until we lose control 
 You in for a wild ride 
 Do you wanna ride baby 
 'Cause I don't mind driving you crazy 
 I heard you like to go fast girl 
 'Cause no, I don't run out of gas girl 
 So would you let me pull up to your bumper 
 In my new black car 
 Girl rev up your engine, I'll push start your ignition 
 Pull up to your bumper 
 In my new black car 
 Girl rev up your engine, I'll push start your ignition
