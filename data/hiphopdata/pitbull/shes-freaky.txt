One time for my freaks 
 That know what to do when I 
 Skeet, Skeet! That like it 
 Hard, raw, face down, ass up 
 Yes sir! That like their hair pulled 
 When you beat from da back 
 That's what I like 
 But mami can you really get down like that? 
 She's Freaky! She knows how to do what I like just right! 
 She's Freaky! She likes you to talk dirty all night! 
 She's Freaky! She likes her ass slapped when she rides! 
 She's Freaky! And a freak is what I need in my life! 
 One, little two, little three, little four 
 Five, little six, little seven, little hoes 
 Now calling all freaks that like blind folds 
 Fi, fi, fo! FUM go ahead and blow me now 
 I need a freak to hold me down! 
 I like the way you move 
 And the way you do the things you do 
 Can I get at you? 
 I'm just telling you the truth 
 Maybe I'm too blunt, but why front! 
 You got it going on, just pull up your skirt 
 I know what to do with your thong! 
 I'ma Pull it to da side and rub it down right 
 Let me know if I'm wrong! 
 Look at those eyes, look at those thighs 
 I could tell by da way she act that 
 She's Freaky and knows how to keep secrets 
 And knows how to throw it back right! 
 Go ahead and hurt me... 
 Put it on me, put it on me 
 Throw it back like an old jersey 
 I want y'all, I want y'all 
 To get loose, get crunk, get high, get drunk 
 To da point of no return, take one more shot 
 And feel da burn, now work it out 
 Shake that thing till you can't no more now! 
 Work it out, take that thing d-down to da floor now! 
 Work it out, Shake that thing till you can't no more now! 
 Work it out, take that thing d-down to da floor now!
