Austin man keep doin' yo thing 
 Let these boys keep slippin' man 
 I'm not into gymnastics but I'm into flippin' things 
 I told these women that it's all about the team, Jordan and Pippen man 
 So if you wanna join the team 
 Now tell me up in this thing, dale! 
 When I saw her 
 Walking down the street 
 She looked so fine 
 I just had to speak 
 I asked her name 
 But she turned away 
 As she walked 
 All that I could say was 
 Mmm mmm yeah yeah 
 Mmm mmm yeah yeah 
 Mmm mmm yeah yeah 
 All that I could say was 
 Mmm mmm yeah yeah 
 Mmm mmm yeah yeah 
 Mmm mmm yeah yeah 
 All that I could say was 
 Rollin' up one time, we'll make it up as we go 
 I know you feel it 'cause I mean what I said said said said 
 We can do whatever, do whatever we want 
 If she walk past me I say hehe he he he (he he) 
 So tell me where you're from, where you wanna go 
 But she walked past me like ain't said a word 
 Stood there like man 
 Girl I don't usually feel some type of way 
 But this one hear me out it's some kind of place, God!

 Six inch heels clickin' up and down the street 
 You know she's comin' and when she walks away way way way 
 Look I'm a big big deal, a little fun's all I need 
 But I can tell she don't believe what I said said said said said 
 So tell me where you're from, where you wanna go

 She looks so good but she bad bad 
 You can that back from the front front 
 Move it like criss cross, jump jump 
 Meet me in the middle of the ocean 
 We can find ourselves and lose a magi rewind 
 Wawawawa, play 
 Find ourselves and lose a magic day 
 Austin, man Armando acabando latinos y gringos gozando me entiendes 
 For those that thought that we would stop 
 They don't even have a mind to think with, brainless 
 Most of them broke but they're famous 
 Some got hitched but they're nameless 
 But mamita, forget about that

 All that I could say was 
 Mmm mmm yeah yeah
