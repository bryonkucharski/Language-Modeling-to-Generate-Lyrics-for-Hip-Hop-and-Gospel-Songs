You have to have vision to understand love is blind 
 Talk to 'em Ty 
 It's been a while and you found somebody else 
 They say you really doing good for yourself 
 But I know you out there feeling so lonely 
 As far as my eyes can see 
 Don't need no proof or no validation 
 You leave no wound on you second to none 
 You said you over me but you looking lonely 
 So as far as my eyes can see, you look better on me 
 Aw aw aw, aw aw aw, aw aw aw 
 You look better on me 
 Aw aw aw, aw aw aw, aw aw aw 
 As far as my eyes can see, you look better on me 
 Got a room with a mirror on the roof 
 Down in the keys keys keys 
 And I could bet the bank and almost guarantee 
 That you will always look better on me 
 I handle my business in the boardroom and the bedroom 
 My name ain't max but I always got headroom 
 G-g- get it, g-g- g-g- get it 
 Went from selling perico and reefer 
 To New Year's Eve with Snoop and Latifah 
 I shut down Spain 
 And I ain't even have to take a pill in Ibiza 
 I'm a beast bro 
 I love when you put on them sexy one piece outfits 
 With the hole in the middle 
 Now take a look in the mirror 
 And see you always look better on me 
 It's been a while and you found somebody else 
 They say you really doing good for yourself 
 But I know you out there feeling so lonely 
 As far as my eyes can see 
 Don't need no proof or no validation 
 You leave no wound on you second to none 
 You said you over me but you looking lonely 
 So as far as my eyes can see, you look better on me 
 Aw aw aw, aw aw aw, aw aw aw 
 You look better on me 
 Aw aw aw, aw aw aw, aw aw aw 
 As far as my eyes can see, you look better on me 
 I'm allergic to the fake and these negative crabs 
 So get from me with your negative ass 
 I live for the future, you live in the past 
 Found somebody else, I hope that it lasts 
 But you know that I know that we know that you'll be thinking 'bout me 
 But you know that I know that we know that you look, that you look better on me 
 I ain't here to sell ya, I'm here to tell ya, all I've ever done is learn from my failures 
 So god bless mami, cause God knows I wish you the best mami, that's right 
 I love when you put on that sexy one piece outfit with the hole in the middle 
 Now take a look in the mirror and see you always look better on me 
 It's been a while and you found somebody else 
 They say you really doing good for yourself 
 But I know you out there feeling so lonely 
 As far as my eyes can see 
 Don't need no proof or no validation 
 You leave no wound on you second to none 
 You said you over me but you looking lonely 
 So as far as my eyes can see, you look better on me 
 Aw aw aw, aw aw aw, aw aw aw 
 You look better on me 
 Aw aw aw, aw aw aw, aw aw aw 
 As far as my eyes can see, you look better on me 
 Better on me 
 Better on me 
 Better on me 
 You look better on me 
 Better on me 
 Better on me 
 As far as my eyes can see, you look better on me
