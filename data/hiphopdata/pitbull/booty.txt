 On the dance floor 
 She got the boom, shake the room 
 That's the lightning and the thunder 
 You wanna meet her 
 You wanna touch her 
 See the light in her eyes 
 And it starts to make you wonder 
 All the sexy girls in the party 
 Go and grab a man, bring him to the dance floor 
 Go on let them jeans touch you while you're dancing 
 It's his birthday, give him what he ask for

 Hold on tight for the ride 
 'Cause you know you wanna love her
