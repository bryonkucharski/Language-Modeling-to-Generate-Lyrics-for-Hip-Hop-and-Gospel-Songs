 You got dat sexy walk 
 You got dem pretty eyes 
 You like Aaliyah, one in a million, 
 Dat's how I feel inside 
 So I'm writin' you dis one page letter, 
 To let you know what it is 
 I think about you while I'm in 
 Da car, da club, da crib 
 I don't know what you do to me 
 First time I feel this way 
 I don't know what to do no more 
 Attracted to you in a freaky way 
 I can tell that you know what to do, 
 When you do what you do 
 So how 'bout we get together some time, 
 Baby just me and you, I want to

 (Both) 
 Love it when you lick your lips, 
 Love your smile 
 Love it when you let your hair down, 
 That drives me wild 
 Baby you're just right, 
 Baby you're my type 
 How 'bout we leave the club, 
 And make this our night? 
 Let's fulfill fantasies, and live out dreams 
 I promise baby, I aim to please 
 So if you're thinking, what I'm thinking 
 Let's stop thinking and go 
 I'm your secret admirer, keep it on the low

 So if you need some love, give me a call boo 
 I can be the one, to come and freak you 
 At night I think of you (you, baby) 
 I want to be your lover baby 
 And I won't hesitate to come and fall through

 Can't get enough of you
