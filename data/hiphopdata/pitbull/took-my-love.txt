 You took my love, I thought I was the only one 
 You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun 
 You took my love, but my heart keeps telling me you're the one 
 You took my love, took my love 
 Dadadadadi dadadadadada...

 Loquita, I don't play you, you know what time it is with me 
 You want my heart, you got the world, 
 Now show me you'd ride up there for me 
 I can see right through your eyes, and I know what you tryin' to do 
 You tryin' to rob, steal, take my love, well fuck you 
 Take my love, ha ha, not a woman on earth that can do that 
 Say what, I don't know where you from, or where you been at 
 I'm letting you know what's up, and if you don't know, play by the rules 
 Or baby, you get cut, I talked so much, you took my love 
 Vein 
 You took my love, I thought I was the only one 
 You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun 
 You took my love, but my heart keeps telling me you're the one 
 You took my love, took my love

 Yo, I'm in the club, and the place is poppin' 
 Seen a sit in bar, and her face is knockin' 
 Times are great, 'cause I'm with my crew 
 But my smile was fake, 'cause I'm missing you 
 Baby you know that I didn't learn my lesson 
 Shoulda gave you more time, more love and affection 
 And when I see you later with that other guy 
 Keep telling myself that a player ain't suppose to cry

 You took my love, took my love

 She took my love, and played me for a sucker 
 But it don't even matter, 'cause you know I still love her 
 She took my heart, and threw it on the ground 
 But it don't even matter, 'cause I still want her around 
 She's such a love taker, she's such a love taker 
 It's guaranteed that she's a professional heartbreaker 
 But a great lovemaker, all in a sheet 
 She made my heart skipped a beat 
 But for now she's a close as it comes 
 Not mags, no life and no guns 
 She took my love

 You took my love, I thought I was the only one 
 You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun 
 You took my love, but my heart keeps telling me you're the one 
 You took my love, took my love
