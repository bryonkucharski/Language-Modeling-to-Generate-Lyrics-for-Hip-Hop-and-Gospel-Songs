 Catch a chico in Paris 
 Getting money like Arabs 
 Divroced from the game 
 But the streets and I bled marriage 
 I'm allergic to the fake 
 I'm from the land of cake 
 Gloves, mask, tape, 
 Choppa's open ... safe (gimmie that) 
 Funny talk on the phone 
 I'm sorry papo, no sale 
 Down here, yeah they got weight 
 But I'm sorry papo, no scales 
 Banana clips they pop 
 Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pill 
 Think they won't but they will, 
 And they just dying to kill 
 Voli, bad one, always behind me 
 Room full of billionaires that's where you'll find me 
 So far ahead of the game 
 They can't catch me if they rewind me 
 Pull the trigger yourself, 
 Blow your brains out and don't mind me 
 Dale!
