Have you ever seen someone 
 That you thought was so sexy 
 And even though you had a man 
 He was still turnin' you on 
 Move the feelin' right 
 And I see you standin' there 
 Not an ordinary night 
 Feeling lust is in the air (hey) 
 Way your body looks 
 Its turnin' me on 
 They way you lick your lips slow 
 Makes me want you even more 
 Whoa oh oh oh oh 
 Your turnin' me on 
 Whoa oh oh oh oh 
 Your turnin' me on 
 If so attracted 
 Could this be wrong 
 To feel this way 
 And come on so strong 
 Wont take my time 
 Cause you might be gone 
 Don't know your name 
 But your turnin' me on 
 Whoa oh oh oh oh 
 Your turnin' me on 
 Whoa oh oh oh oh 
 Your turnin' me on 
 All alone tonight 
 And I left my man at home 
 I can't 
 Get you out my site 
 I know 
 This feeling is so wrong (hey) 
 I wanna approach you 
 Let you know how I feel 
 Wanna do more to 
 Try to seal this deal 
 End of the night 
 Can I 
 Wait for you outside 
 We can 
 End this evening right 
 We can 
 Kick it on the side 
 I need to experience 
 What you can do 
 We'll have a private party 
 For just me and you 
 First time I ever been so 
 Attracted to a stranger 
 Don't know if this is wrong but 
 Don't mind if in a danger 
 You caught my eye 
 Minute that I saw you 
 Knowin' that a may wanna get to know you 
 Can I get your name 
 Makin' me say (your turnin' me on)
