I know you full of shit 
 Your so full of shit 
 Believe none of what you hear 
 And only half of what you see 
 Believe none of what you hear 
 And only half what you see 
 Believe none of what you hear 
 And only half of what you see 
 (Let me tell you what I think about there boys out here in the state they call the game) 
 Believe nothing of what you hear and only half of what you see, ya heard me 
 I'm sick of these rappers slash actors pa pa playing a part 
 All they talk about is they money 
 And ch ch chosin' cars 
 So put pha pha Phantoms and Bentleys'? 
 And how they squeeze to listen getting high 
 They move it hooray 
 Another dope boy wannabe 
 All in the club talking back 
 Wha' wha' what what they got 
 Pull out the club on 26's 
 Go str-straight to they momma's house 
 Like southern Cali they hardly ever make it rain to drizzle 
 That's why I do them so opposite of these nizzle for shizzles 
 Ah tell 'em 
 Believe none of what your hear 
 And only half of what you see 
 Believe none of what your hear 
 And only half of what you see 
 Believe none of what your hear 
 And only half of what you see 
 Believe none of what your hear 
 And only half of what you see 
 Ya heard me 
 The boy knows his alphabet so now he think he a G 
 He run a little pot so he think he a thug 
 Bu bu but all eyes on me 
 They used to wanna be like mike 
 Now they just wannabe on the mic 
 They cut fucked up deals with music 
 And even if they got 25 to life 
 They'll be singing like Whitney 
 Before before she met bobby 
 These boys think think they hard 
 Knowing they green like wasabi 
 They'll be singing like Whitney 
 Before before she met bobby 
 These boys think think they hard 
 Knowing they green like wasabi 
 Now tell um 
 Believe none of what you hear 
 And only half of what you see 
 Believe none of what you hear 
 And only half of what you see 
 Believe none of what you hear 
 And only half of what you see 
 Believe none of what you hear 
 And only half of what you see 
 Ya heard me 
 These boys right now they got a house full of cars 
 A bank account full of money 
 They act like they on full 
 But check this out fool 
 I know your full of shit 
 Believe none of what you hear 
 And only half of what you see 
 Believe none of what you hear 
 And only half of what you see 
 Believe none of what you hear 
 And only half of what you see 
 Believe none of what you hear 
 And only half of what you see
