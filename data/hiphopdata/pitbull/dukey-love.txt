Drop that beat, 
 It's the truth. 
 You don't know what you have until you lose it. 
 I've had all the women you could possibly imagine, in my life. 
 I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the money, in my life. 
 I've had my ups, my downs, I paid my dues. 
 Learn my stride? 
 Love for the passion... ? 
 All I know is the hustle and grind. 
 All you want is some quality time. 
 I can't give it to you due to the life that I choose. 
 My heart is so close to the point my blood had froze. 
 I might wear diamonds if they really could freeze time. 
 But then again time is money and I need mine. 
 There I go again being selfish, 
 And there you go again the love and helpless. 
 You mean the world to me baby you know it's the truth. 
 But I don't know who I love more you or the booth. 
 These are just the things I need to get off my chest. 
 Sometimes I feel like all I can give you is sex. 
 I'm sorry 
 I've had all the women you could possibly imagine, in my life. 
 I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the money, in my life. 
 I've had my ups, my downs, I paid my dues. 
 Learned my stripes. 
 Love... ? 
 I ain't gone lie, baby this life is addicting. 
 The fame, the money, ecspecially these bitches. 
 I've been around it all, I've seen them ball. 
 Seen them fall, go broke and lose it all. 
 That's why I work hard, 365. 
 24-7, baby that's my life. 
 I bleed, I feed, I sleep, I shit this. 
 I got a bad stomach with these haters on my shit list. 
 I know it's hard to understand, 
 But it's outta my hands, 
 This is God's plan. 
 I came, I saw, I conquered. 
 I apoligise, but this game is a monster. 
 I've had all the women you could possibly imagine, in my life. 
 I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the money, in my life. 
 I've had my ups, my downs, I paid my dues. 
 Learned my stripes. 
 Love... ?
