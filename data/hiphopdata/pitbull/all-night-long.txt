I see everybody around but it feels like we're in private 
 I know you want me so bad cause you just can't seem to hide it 
 The lights are moving to the rhythm of the music, 
 When we're together, 
 Everything just comes together, baby 
 So inspired by the movement, 
 We can lose it, I hope you're ready 
 As long as I see the strobe lights, 
 I'm dancing all night long 
 When we're together, baby, 
 I'm feeling all right, 
 You got me all night long 
 So tell the DJ play it all night long, 
 All night long, all night, night, night 
 So tell the DJ play it all night long, 
 All night long, all night, night night 
 So tell the DJ play it 
 Tonight the admission is free, 
 Now we're shutting the club down 
 We moving now to the streets, 
 All we got left is love now 
 Feel my troubles fading to the rhythm of your heart beat, 
 When we're together, 
 Everything just comes together baby 
 Every motion calls your name, 
 Baby once you start me 
 And I hope you're ready 
 So tell the DJ play it, 
 All my worries help me put the past behind 
 All around us this worlds in a hurry 
 While we stand still in time 
 Feels like we're moving to the rhythm of the music, 
 When we're together 
 Everything just comes together, baby 
 So inspired by the movement 
 We can't lose it 
 And I hope you're ready 
 So tell the DJ play it, 
 It's only you and me together 
 And this feelings so strong, 
 Wish it could stay like this forever 
 All night long, all night long 
 Said all night long.
