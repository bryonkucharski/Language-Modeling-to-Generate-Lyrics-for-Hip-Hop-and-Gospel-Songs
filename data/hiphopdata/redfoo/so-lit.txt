What I need is you and me 
 Sucking and fucking each other, the birds and the bees 
 You know you hot, but you ain't got 
 A nigga like me to hit the spot 
 Ecstasy is what we'll be 
 Tell your clique, we finna dip 
 You're coming with me 
 Oh, we gon' party at the afterparty 
 It's just I'mma take you home alone before everybody shows up 
 'Cause you got me so lit 
 Come and take me higher, baby 
 You got me so lit 
 Come and take me higher, baby 
 Cruising and strip in the convertible, hands up 
 I'm losing my grip 'cause you so beautiful when you stand up 
 In the backseat, hair blowing in the wind 
 Girl, watch yourself before I jump back there and get up in it 
 Now I'm actually ghost riding the whip 
 'Cause I'm fucking with you 
 If we crash, I don't give a shit, no I don't 
 'Cause girl, you make me so fucking hot, I wanna burn up 
 The way you make up at the spot when we turn up 
 It's beautiful 
 Girl, yo booty's full like the moon in the sky now 
 'Cause you got me so lit 
 Come and take me higher, baby 
 You got me so lit 
 Come and take me higher, baby 
 You got me so lit 
 You got me so lit 
 Come and take me higher 
 You got me so lit 
 Come and take me higher, baby 
 You got me so lit 
 Come and take me higher, baby
