Yo, I need to know 
 Who came to turn up at their favorite festival 
 I need some people, some party people 
 To jump on stage and rage with your bro 
 That's why I'm calling all my ravers, best-in-candy flavors 
 Calling all my hipsters too cool to be my listeners 
 Calling all the scenesters with ironic t-shirts 
 "Say no to drugs", "Gay for pay" and "Free Justin Bieber" 
 "Excuse me, who are you? Excuse me, who are you?" 
 I am the conductor, the beat is your instructor 
 All aboard! 
 Get on that party train 
 Get on that party train 
 Chigga chigga chigga chigga chigga chigga chug 
 Chigga chigga chigga chigga chigga chigga chug 
 Chigga chigga chigga chigga chigga chigga chug 
 Chigga chigga chigga chigga chigga chigga chug 
 Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug 
 Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug 
 Get on that party train 
 I can feel I need to let loose, loose in your caboose 
 I need to drink some juice with some gin so I can win 
 And party with all of my friends 
 That's why I'm calling all my groupies 
 And rats that like them bottles 
 Calling all my duck-faced Instagram models 
 Calling all the cuties doing squats for their booties 
 And Snapchatters, I need more disappearing boobies 
 Ass, cash or flash, no one rides for free 
 Ass, cash or flash, no one rides for free (But me!) 
 I am the conductor, the beat is your instructor 
 Get on that party train 
 Get on that party train 
 Chigga chigga chigga chigga chigga chigga chug 
 Chigga chigga chigga chigga chigga chigga chug 
 Chigga chigga chigga chigga chigga chigga chug 
 Chigga chigga chigga chigga chigga chigga chug 
 Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug 
 Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug 
 Get on that party train
