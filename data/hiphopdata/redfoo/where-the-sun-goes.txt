Lady, I've been watching you 
 Ooh, baby, I know you've been watching me too 
 You're the type of girl 
 In demand and loves to dance to make the boys go insane 
 If you're the type of girl 
 Drink in hand and loves the sand 
 Then baby I'm your man 
 Let me take you where the sun goes 
 I can make your fantasies come to life 
 Wherever the sun goes 
 Baby we can leave our shadows behind 
 (Let's Stevie get something now) 
 Baby, like animals in the wild 
 We could play all day and all night 
 Underneath the stars 
 I'm the type of girl 
 In demand and loves to dance to make the boys go insane 
 Yeah, yeah, I'm the type of girl 
 Drink in hand and loves the sand 
 So baby take me by the hand 
 Let me take you where the sun goes 
 I can make your fantasies come to life 
 Wherever the sun goes 
 Baby we can leave our shadows behind 
 Whoa-oh, leave our shadows behind 
 Whoa-oh, leave our shadows behind 
 Yo, yo, let's go now 
 Beep, beep, beep beep 
 Guess who's rollin' in the snowed out Jeep 
 On fleek, got an extra seat 
 If you wanna roll with me and be free 
 Ooh wee, let the games begin 
 Turn up, volume on 10 
 What a feeling, no ceiling 
 Hands up, hair blowing in the wind, uh 
 Two villains on the run 
 Yeah, two kids following the sun 
 Footprints in the sand, skipping rocks 
 Holding hands, knee deep in the white wash 
 It's getting late but we ain't done yet 
 Till the Coast Guard take our postcard by the sunset 
 Me and you sippin' Malibu with a view 
 Let me take you where the sun goes 
 I can make your fantasies come to life 
 Wherever the sun goes 
 Baby we can leave our shadows behind 
 Whoa-oh, leave our shadows behind 
 Whoa-oh, leave our shadows behind 
 (Sun goes, sun goes) 
 I'm gonna take you where the sun goes 
 (Sun goes, sun goes) 
 I'm gonna take you where the sun goes
