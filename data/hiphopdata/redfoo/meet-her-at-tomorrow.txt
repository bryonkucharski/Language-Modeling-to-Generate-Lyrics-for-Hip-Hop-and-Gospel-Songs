Pretty girl always on my mind 
 When I try to chase her, I be running out of time 
 Yesterday, I set her free, my heart's a little hollow 
 If it's really meant to be, then I'll meet her at tomorrow 
 Pretty girl always on my mind 
 When I try to chase her, I be running out of time 
 Yesterday, I set her free, my heart's a little hollow 
 If it's really meant to be, then I'll meet her at tomorrow 
 What we had was magic 
 What we had was magic in our love 
 What we had was magic 
 What we had was magic in our love 
 Our love is like two doves in flight 
 Two gloves fitting tight, true loves will unite 
 Our love is like chemistry, heavenly 
 Ivory, ebony, opposites meant to be 
 And you're the one I'm choosing 
 That's why I keep our love cruising 
 In time, we will be back together 
 Pretty girl always on my mind 
 When I try to chase her, I be running out of time 
 Yesterday, I set her free, my heart's a little hollow 
 If it's really meant to be, then I'll meet her at tomorrow 
 Pretty girl always on my mind

 What we had was magic 
 What we had was magic in our love 
 What we had was magic 
 What we had was magic in our love
