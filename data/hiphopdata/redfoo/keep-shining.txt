 Nobody knows how it all turns out 
 We promise to party out of control

 We gon' keep shining, shining, shining 
 We gon' keep shining, shining, shining

 I'm walking in the club like every night 
 If you're hating on me, you must be in the line 
 I been on my grind, now it's my time 
 To kick back and enjoy this vodka and lime 
 Yo, I got my Party Rock crew, we raging 
 Shuffle bot and Q in the b-boy stance amazing 
 Got a beat that rocks the bass man 
 Industry that tries to chase me 
 When it's me, I'm only racing 
 So you see I'm first place, man

 Good vibes and we feeling right 
 Everybody, raise your shots 
 'Cause this is what we do when we party rock

 I'm like that long shot, 30 to 1, strong slot 
 Never carry a gun, but I'm gon' pop 
 Now I'm earning some and it won't stop 
 Won't stop, can't stop, the man's hot 
 #1 in the dance spot, yo 
 #2 is the place for you if you're racing Foo, face it dude 
 I like to shock ya, rock ya, drink some vodka 
 Shots up to my crew and you and to my Foo fans 
 Move into the movement, groove into the smooth synth 
 This is a deep abyss, I keep a fist pumping 
 And the bass thumping, and I see your hands up in the air 
 We got this place jumping, taking these shots like we don't care 
 Yo, it's all good, she wants it all wood 
 I see some cuties with booties, I think we all should
