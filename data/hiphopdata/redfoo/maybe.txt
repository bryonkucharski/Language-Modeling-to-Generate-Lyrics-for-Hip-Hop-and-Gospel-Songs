Maybe I wrote this song 'cause I had to 
 Maybe I wrote this song to pay the bills 
 Maybe I wrote this song for an excuse when we're alone 
 Maybe I wrote this song to say I love you 
 Maybe I wrote this song for the super fans 
 Maybe I wrote this song to show 'em exactly who I am 
 Maybe I wrote this song for an excuse when we're alone 
 Maybe I wrote this song to say I love you 
 Yeah, Jason on the drum 
 All I can see in this world is you and me 
 Living and laughing and playing as one 
 But when I have to leave you, I realize that I need to 
 Look you in the eyes and say I love you 
 Maybe I wrote this song to say I love you 
 'Cause all I can see in this world is you and me 
 Living and laughing and playing as one 
 But when I have to leave you, I realize that I need to 
 Look you in the eyes and say I love you

 Maybe I wrote this song to say I love you 
 I said maybe I wrote this song for an excuse when we're alone 
 Maybe I wrote this song to say I love you 
 I love you
