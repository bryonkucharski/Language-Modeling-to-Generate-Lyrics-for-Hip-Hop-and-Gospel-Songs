 Hot flashes in your face 
 They call your name all over the place 
 What you see Redfoo with the animal print 
 When you move real quick hands up in the sprint 
 Yeah! Whip that hair! 
 Turn around, stop and stare 
 Work it and it ain't hard to see 
 You got what it takes to be a nominee

 Where did she go? 
 Let's shake the tape 
 Does the red carpet ma-match the drape 
 I shake that body like a mount of Play-Doh 
 I peel that dress like a ripe potatoe 
 Skin tight all night 
 Sweatin' like we were just tipin' a fight 
 Finish last too much to handle 
 I got something big to put on your mantle 
 And it ain't a Mackerel 
 And it ain't a Jackle 
 And it ain't a fractal 
 But it'll last forever 
 And it ain't a sweater 
 And it ain't pleather 
 More like a leather 
 Lets sing together 
 Girl, I'm lookin' for a winner 
 (Who's hungry?) For the dinner 
 And maybe just show me 
 Do you want the big trophy? 
 Ah! If you do that girl! 
 Do it! If you do that girl! 
 Ah! If you do that girl! 
 Do it! If you that girl like! 
 Ah! If you do that girl like! 
 Yeah! If you do that girl like! 
 Ah! If you do that girl!

 Body! (Do it!) My body! (Do it!)

 Body! Um... Bo! Um... ah! 
 Um... Can I get a glass of water? 
 And a lozenger? Oh thank 
 Oh not a lobster a lozenger!
