(Richie Rich) 
 Come out and play... 
 (Woman's Voice) 
 Playboy... 
 (Richie Rich laughing) 
 (Woman's Voice) 
 Playboy... 
 (Richie Rich) 
 Whatchu know about that? Ah... 
 All bad bitches, lock windows 
 Lock doors 
 Fake pimps lock hoes 
 Niggas with diet game too late stole clothes 
 Real bitches fuck with deez and not those 
 When I'm at the club and they pop the doze 
 Nigga keep ya eyes open, watch the hoes 
 Could it be the walk foo? 
 The shoes, or the clothes? 
 Or maybe they be bound to the game I throw 
 It's the raspy, genuine, into mine 
 When I'm on the field keep him on the sideline 
 That soft shit you spit, it ain't tight 
 I never known the hoes to bite on game light 
 'Cause it ain't right 
 To slide through in S Fish 
 Lauren's a dish and deals with the best bitch 
 Trick I shoots this 
 Like Marcus Ray-Boy 
 I bring it to life 'cause I'm a true playboy nigga... 
 Playboy, he's runnin' the game straight raw 
 Playboy, he's givin' you much much more 
 Playboy, he's runnin' the game straight raw 
 Playboy, he's givin' you much much more... 
 (Richie Rich) 
 I just knocked a euro-bitch in a mazarate 
 See Rich pimp hoes in tennis shoes and gym clothes 
 But I'll boot a bitch 
 Who got ass like she's black 
 Love to fuck me, Bruce Lee sucky-sucky 
 Now I run hoes of all nationalities 
 And when I'm in the zone 
 Her breasts might be silicone 
 Might catch me on the stroll with a bad bitch 
 I'm checkin' loot 
 Nigga listen to the game I shoot 
 When I'm out alone 
 I seem to knock straight hoes 
 Be on the lo-lo 
 But niggas screamin dat's they hoe 
 You come and get this bitch 
 'Cause double-R got more 
 And what I do 
 My stable stays stuffed like glew 
 I put my vocal on it 
 And call me raspy nigga 
 9 hoes, fine hoes 
 Don't even ask me nigga 
 I ace 'em up 
 My shoes, my bitches, lace 'em up 
 It's the real McCoy 
 A O.G. Playboy foo' 
 (Some beat boxing) 
 (Richie Rich) 
 Since I'm gonna be 
 Heres a map, for the wanna-be's 
 The game pick up niggas 
 Stick away quick 
 Why push 19s, when I could slip on dubs 
 And check this 
 Once or twice a day switch fits 
 Be a heat packer 
 Safe from the street jackers 
 I rock ice 
 The type of cat to hit a block twice 
 Call up once, sac run up, baby no fronts 
 Smoke blunts 
 Only let her hit the light once 
 Compare 
 So damn different than a playa 
 The first one 
 He be the worst one 
 Bitches to the left 
 Me and my cat Hew Hef 
 Play me 
 Ya lose the L and pay me in ?? toes 
 That's the type of shit I tell hoes 
 Prefer puppies 
 That drown in the game like guppies 
 Now they swimmin 
 Straight lakes, born to chase women 
 Play it slow 
 My lifestyle's smoother than Trojan nigga
