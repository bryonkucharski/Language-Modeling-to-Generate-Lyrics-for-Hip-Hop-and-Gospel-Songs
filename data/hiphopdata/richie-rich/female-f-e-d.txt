I would hope that you are clue-in' this, 'cause I'm pursuin' this 
 My manager's money, keeps me doin' this 
 I'm a Trojan when it comes to rhyme 
 I'd be a Bulova if I were made to keep time 
 But I'm a rapper, so my title is an M.C 
 I'm from the O-A-K-L-A-N-D 
 Sunny California if you know what I mean 
 West Coast, baby boy, where the walls are clean 
 Uzis packed, so don 
 t talk smack 
 The crew's 12-deep, you're bound to get jacked 
 Makin' money, yes, in the city of O 
 Wakin' up every morning tryna clock that dough 
 So many gifts from the grind 
 Ragtop Beamers to the drop 6-9 
 I can't walk a block without my gat 
 And the reason being: it's just like that 
 Payin' lawyers case after case 
 And to soothe the pain, I need the studio's bass 
 Every day I read the news, dope game blues 
 Two brothas killed on a joyride cruise 
 Front-page story, way too heavy 
 Teenagers found dead in a 6-9 Chevy 
 Just the other day, I don't why 
 I got at this woman in a Samurai 
 Her jeep was red, the top was white 
 We made a date for Saturday night 
 Well, Saturday came and I just couldn't wait 
 To take this girl on a hot date 
 So I took a trip to the mall 
 To get a fresh brand new kit, shoes and all 
 Wad in my pocket, about 2 G's 
 Conrad's beepin', jockin' me 
 Too much business and too little time 
 It's a quarter to 8 and my date's at 9 
 Should I kick it with the money or should I wait? 
 With a pocket full of cash, I'd sure feel great 
 Rushed to the house, showered, changed my clothes 
 Then I got my butler to clean the vogues 
 The Beamer's cool, but it's too legit 
 So on this mission, I'll squat Biarritz 
 Got to her house one minute late 
 She opened up the door lookin' great 
 Her hair real long and the outfit Guess 
 But me in the kit, I was way too fresh 
 I led her to the door, politely opened the door 
 Reserved dinner, and then we flew to the show 
 When the show was over, it was time to eat 
 But in my pants, I felt my meat 
 Startin' to grow to a larger size 
 As I stared at her creamy thighs 
 She didn't say much but she asked a lot 
 That's when I thought it was a plot 
 Could a girl like her fall for me? Of course 
 But I kept thinkin' she was part of the force 
 So we skipped dinner and went to her room 
 A brotha like me, I couldn't wait to groom 
 Within ten minutes, I'd be in the cooler 
 Pumpin' and pantin' like a raw old schooler 
 'Cause that's just part of the Oakland game 
 Ten minutes to the cooler and I don't know the name 
 She gave her name, then dropped the Guess 
 The big camisole sure did impress 
 I pumped for hours and fell asleep 
 And woke up straight in questioning 
 I was steamin', my face dark red 
 Got juiced for a date with a female fed 
 So they questioned me, answered my pager's calls 
 And this was the start of my downfall 
 I got 7-to-10 for tax evasion 
 But I got away with three because of lawyer's persuasion 
 Three years went by, pockets way in the red 
 My first phone call was to a man named JED 
 He hooked me up with some studio time 
 'Cause he knew I had more than a talent to rhyme 
 D dropped some beats, I added some lyrics 
 And now it's on the market so the people can hear it 
 She was a female fed (x2)
