Dedicate this to my man Tupac 
 Rest in peace, boy, you know it's all luv 
 Do we get to go? Do we go? 
 I want to know right now, I need to know 
 Who holds jurisdiction over my twisted thoughts? 
 And I'm not to blame for what happens off in this game 
 I'm do or die about my scratch but I know 
 This dope game for me just ain't tha way to go 
 But still I'm there grin and Waten 
 For that next paper thinkin' about how to loaded another caper 
 It's some cold shit to know, I can slang all night and slang all day 
 But never have tha courage to pray 
 Believe I know better but somehow I feel that I'm lost at the crossroads 
 But I'm afraid to cross, could it be what I'm drinkin' ? It got me thinkin' 
 Like I'm thinkin', "Lord I need help but I can't help my self" 
 I awake to to sirens, homies dien, kids in tha street with no food to eat 
 Hoes gettin' money in they only profession 
 But Lord I only got one question? 
 Do G's get to go to Heaven? 
 'Cause I don't wanna die 
 But if so I'd like to know 
 Do G's get to go to Heaven? 
 'Cause I don't wanna die 
 Do G's get to go to Heaven? 
 'Cause I don't wanna die 
 But if so I'd like to know 
 Do G's get to go to Heaven? 
 'Cause I don't wanna die 
 And if I took a life are perhaps sold some dope 
 Would you discriminate upon my entry to tha gate? 
 I need to know my fate, 'cause now my life ain't straight 
 But look at this place where I live it's so so crooked 
 I didn't shot that man but I watched him die 
 And saw tha pain and struggle in his eye and didn't cry 
 So when I hear tha thunder are you takin' me under? 
 Are is my seein' as bad as tha gooder 
 Do G's get to go to Heaven? 
 'Cause I don't wanna die 
 But if so I'd like to know 
 Do G's get to go to Heaven? 
 'Cause I don't wanna die 
 Do G's get to go to Heaven? 
 'Cause I don't wanna die 
 But if so I'd like to know 
 Do G's get to go to Heaven? 
 'Cause I don't wanna die 
 For every time I walked by and every time I got high 
 For every man that I watched die, Lord, I need to know 
 Do Gs get to go for all tha women I run through? 
 Those I did and didn't plan to? 
 For every scam I ran my hands through? 
 Lord, I need to do gs get to go? 
 And if they get to go, when it's time to meet my maker 
 Will, he understand that I'm only a man flesh 'n' bone 
 Born to die in tha zone, and gets loney trying to make it on 
 Ya own 
 And when my baby cries my intentions are to feed 
 And fulfill tha needs of my one and only seed 
 And if I rob and steal let it read in my will 
 "Payback tha ones who fell victims to my guns on tha run" 
 But knowin' that I can't hide, why do I feel tha way I feel in side? 
 It's like my soul is leavin' me, are you deceivin' me? 
 I hear voices, sayin' believe in me, is it you I hear? 
 There's a man named God that can fix it, when it's twisted 
 Not sayin' I'm all that bad but I can use a lil help 
 'Cause at times I can't help my self 
 Do G's get to go to Heaven? 
 'Cause I don't wanna die 
 But if so I'd like to know 
 Do G's get to go to Heaven? 
 'Cause I don't wanna die 
 Do G's get to go to Heaven? 
 'Cause I don't wanna die 
 But if so I'd like to know 
 Do G's get to go to Heaven? 
 'Cause I don't wanna die 
 Do G's get to go to? 
 Do G's get to go to? 
 Do G's get to go to? 
 Do G's get to go to? 
 Do G's get to go to Heaven? 
 Do G's get to go to? 
 Do G's get to go to? 
 Do G's get to go to? 
 Do G's get to go to Heaven? 
 'Cause I don't wanna die 
 But if so I'd like to know 
 Do G's get to go to Heaven? 
 'Cause I don't wanna die 
 Do G's get to go to Heaven? 
 'Cause I don't wanna die 
 But if so I'd like to know 
 Do G's get to go to Heaven? 
 'Cause I don't wanna die 
 I know what's wrong, I know what's right 
 Will I go to Heaven if I die tonight 
 If I feel down, I might find 
 Will I got to Heaven if I die tonight? 
 Only you know whether it's day or night 
 Will I go to Heaven if I die tonight? 
 Heaven, oh, Heaven 
 Will I go to Heaven if I die tonight? 
 Heaven, oh, Heaven 
 Will I go to Heaven if I die tonight?
