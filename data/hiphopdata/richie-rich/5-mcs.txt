(Yo, what's up, Rich, man? The word on the street is that 5 MCs wanna get wit' you on the showdown tip.) 
 (Man, is they gettin' like that out there?) 
 RR: Man, if it ain't one thang, it's another. I'm just gonna kick it to 'em with this element of surprise, you know what I'm sayin'? 
 (Richie Rich) 
 Instrumental flow, lyrical write-off 
 Brothas wanna peek the styles and try to bite off 
 The way that I rhyme, when I flow, I'm flowin' slowly 
 But see the punks, they don't know me 
 So they run up, most of 'em strapped, I ain't trippin' 
 I'm relaxed, I'm 'bout to bust a cap 
 Baseball hat holdin' sweat on my brow 
 I'm kinda nervous now 'cause I don't know how 
 Should I flow slow, fast, or maybe off-beat 
 On the knowledge tip, or should I kick it to the street? 
 Save it, I've got another suggestion 
 A freestyle from the mind's collection 
 MC Number 1, he stepped up 
 I pressed up, so his rhyme was messed up 
 Spit a little rhyme about the way that I served it 
 Man, and the sucka deserved it 
 I wasn't deep, solo, no crew 
 Then steps up, MC Number 2 
 He's talkin' about havin' money for real 
 So I steal, and dished the man a raw deal 
 He couldn't stomach it, he started coughin' up blood 
 Two MCs to the mud 
 I try to tell these fools that Richie Rich ain't playin' 
 While the music's playin', the tongue be slayin' 
 They didn't hear me though, they kept slippin' 
 And MC Number 3, he better come in rippin' 
 I peeked his hoe card, he's look like a biter 
 I ain't sweatin' that, 'cause I'm a writer 
 And a freestyler, and man, I get wild 
 On a trick MC who wants to bite my style 
 See, there's only one Richie Rich in the industry 
 And suckaz will soon learn to quit offendin' me 
 Man, I ain't takin' it, I'm headed for one place 
 To get my money on in the cool rap race 
 See, Dubble-R, to me, he's just a shadow 
 The one who appears when it's time to battle 
 But Richie Rich, he's bound to grow fa sho 
 So step on up, he's MC Number 4 
 When the man approached, he struck for the neck 
 But the rhyme was weak, so the boy was checked 
 Like a lawn mower with a high-speed blade 
 I got wit' him, first with a high-top fade 
 And then the chest section, 'cause he was lackin' a vest 
 He fell to the floor, that's when he confessed 
 That's four MCs, man, I'm no joke 
 I surprised Number 5 with a dose of the Loc 
 (D-Loc) 
 Wait, hold it, buddy, it ain't over wit' yet 
 Number 5, step up, the last contestant 
 You can't get away with dissin' my man, Rich 
 You know why? 'Cause D-Loc is on top of it 
 Now I'mma flow like wind when it blows 
 And it ya like a hurricane, swing ya like a tornado 
 When the whirpool ends, once again, Richie Rich holds the title, rated champion 
 The mistake you made was to play the game played by big macks 
 Rulers of the 24-tracks 
 I got news, silly: you better get wise, 'cause you're dealin' with the element of surprise
