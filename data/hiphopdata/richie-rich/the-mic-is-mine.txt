(As we go a little somethin' like this) (x4) 
 (As we go a little somethin' like this... hit it!) 
 See, the mic is mine, and I'm down to use it 
 And battle any pigeon that dares to abuse it 
 I'm a rhyme artist, so it belongs to me 
 I'm Richie Rich, Dubble-R, that down MC 
 I took a trip to New York disguised as a geek 
 Since they say they're so hard I had to take a peek 
 I went to Queens, the Bronx, and even Brooklyn 
 Had the girls in a daze, and kept them all lookin' 
 Went to all of the parties, I left houses burnin' 
 From Jersey City to Bridgeport and Mount Vernon 
 And I just couldn't see why they're rated so high 
 Man, I'm an Oakland city gangster, a California guy 
 And the mic is mine 
 That's right, it's mine 
 Well, when I left Mount Vernon, what did I see? 
 A light brown beauty, she was fitted for me 
 So, I spoke to the girl as she stared in amazement 
 She said 'hi,' but then she led me to the basement 
 But when she opened the door, oh man, gee 
 The walls were full of pictures, pictures of me 
 She said "drop that disguise, I know who you are 
 You're MC Richie Rich, the California rap star" 
 Her dress slid down, the body go round 
 The baddest old man in the town, he wouldn't frown 
 And a body like hers, the woman had curves 
 But to mess with me, man, she had to have nerves 
 And now she's mine 
 That's right, mine 
 I moved on to Buffalo, and then Woodlawn Beach 
 Got on the mic, 'cause I had a lesson to teach 
 To the New York suckaz who just won't quit 
 Who think they're oh so hard and so legit 
 I tell ya like this, children of New York 
 All the growlin' and yellin', it's soft as pork 
 When it's boiled in a pot of beans 
 And I prefer it over bacon like Sizzlean 
 I'm the California star, the best by far 
 I'm being given gold and dollars, and European cars 
 And when I see something I want, I simply say gimme 
 And pretty soon there will be another rap in me 
 And it'll be mine 
 That's right, mine 
 So when I take things, like your gold or your freak 
 Don't be upset, look, man, it's kinda unique 
 You gotta peek it out this way, you met a rap star 
 He took your gold and your girl, and left you a car 
 You say you know that brotha from the Oakland town 
 Be a player, hang tough, hold your own and be down 
 'Cause on the mic, I'm clownin', punks I'm downin' 
 Don't try to smile, your teeth are jacked, keep frownin' 
 The mic is mine 
 That's right, mine 
 So I left New York en route to L.A 
 I said, what the hell, it's a sunny day 
 I'm a microphone master and I'm in demand 
 I'd get a rent-a-car and head to Disneyland 
 Got off of my plane about 6 o'clock 
 The rent-a-car place was around the block 
 Grabbed my baggage and jogged to the door 
 A sign was posted that I never seen before 
 Printed clearly, it read like this, my friend 
 'We rent Ferraris, Lamborghinis and Benz' 
 My eyes popped out, without a doubt 
 I had a briefcase full of money and too much clout 
 I was next in line and I could hardly wait 
 To get a Lamborghini, so I could devastate 
 So then she took my credit card and 200 in cash 
 Smoking a cigarette, she lightly dumped her ash 
 Then politely she whispered 'red, white or blue?' 
 I said, 'Ah, nah, could this be true? 
 I'll take the red one, ma'am, and I'll also take the key 
 'Cause I'm a rap star, I got places to be.' 
 So I rushed out the door to the fresh red 'ghini 
 Spotted a thick black girl in a bikini 
 I picked her up and took to the room to grind 
 And by the way, that Lamborghini is mine 
 That's right, mine 
 The mic is mine 
 That's right, mine 
 The mic is mine 
 I'm out
