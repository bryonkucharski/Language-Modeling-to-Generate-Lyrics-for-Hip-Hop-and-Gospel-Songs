(Hurry, hurry, step right up 
 And see the side show in town 
 For only 50 cents) 
 (D-Loc) 
 Wait, wait, cut this stuff, man 
 This ain't no side show 
 Rich, kick the side show

 (Make it funky) 
 It's a Saturday night and my girl's lookin' real pretty 
 But jack that, I just left Campbell City 
 Straight lace Zeniths and vogues on a point 
 On my way to the Town to get a doja joint 
 Pushed it to the 7 to get some dank 
 Hit the liquor store to cold get drank 
 Now I got my doja, my drink is like Nitro 
 Peace, playboy, I'm on my way to the side show 
 Down Bancroft, to the light 
 Let me warm it up, I hit a donut tight 
 There's a Chevy on my side, windows straight tinted 
 I think he got hype when he saw me spin it 
 I'm up outta there, sideways to the next light 
 Vogues kinda smokin' but Zeniths still tight 
 I'm at the side show, parlayin and playin' 
 Music on hit, head straight swayin 
 To the sounds of the 415 and the Locster 
 Girlie on the corner on jock, so I approached her 
 Spoke real smooth and said, "Hey, what's happenin'?" 
 She said, "Dubble-R, is that you rappin'?" 
 I said, "Ah nah, baby, that ain't me 
 You listen to the sounds of the L-o-c 
 The same clique, the 415, we make paper 
 But back up, girl, I can see you got the vapors 
 A lazy, tore up and tore down, yo 
 She's lookin' for a trick at the side show 
 You know what I'm sayin'? 
 In Oakland, California, every Saturday night, brothers be ridin' 
 Straight lace Zeniths, drop tops, buckets, high performance 
 We really don't be trippin', you know what I'm sayin'? 
 But now it's like this 
 Police came through, but now they're gone 
 In other words, the side show's on 
 Troy's in a 5-point straight up lit 
 Short's comin' through in a Benz with a kit 
 Oakland's movin somethin', and that's real 
 Bruce from the Deuce comin' through in a 'Ville 
 This is a side show, boy, we don't fake it 
 Police come through on a fluke and try to break it 
 Up like that with a riot hat 
 You're gonna need more than a billy club and a gat 
 To stop the side show, officer, just think 
 Maybe you should come and hit the spot with a tank 
 'Cause the brothers from the O are gonna keep on ridin' 
 Yolkin', hittin' tight ones, straight sidin' 
 See, we ain't really trippin' off jail or the tickets 
 A brother wants to post, make mail and kick it 
 Now listen, this is the code to the show 
 For the people out there who just don't know 
 If your car is real clean, then bring it 
 If it's high-performance, then swing it 
 If it's a motorcycle, you better serve it 
 And if you get a ticket, you better deserve it 
 As long as you can say, "Man, I let 'em know" 
 Then peace, you did it at the side show 
 It's a everyday thing 
 Every Saturday night, brothers be tearin up cars 
 Brothers be comin' through swingin' 'em 
 I don't know what's goin' on, I'm juiced 
 I'm in the Town, I strikes through 
 I see girls, corner to corner, block to block 
 You know, basically it's just (funky) 
 Corner to corner, block to block 
 Flock Zeuses and EV's that knock 
 Gold-diggin women in the City of O 
 Lookin' for a brother with a cash flow 
 That's the type of things that gets 'em off 
 Material stuff, at the side show, boss 
 Brothers get started, and man, don't quit 
 Kiki's on a ninja, servin' it 
 It's about 2 o'clock and the show's still movin' 
 Girls all at the gas station choosin' 
 A brother like me never ever spends cash on those 
 Nah, I need a new set of vogues 
 Candy paint will make a freak peep 
 But she'll never get a nickel or a dime out of me 
 Peace to everybody in the O that I know 
 Dubble-R gettin' witcha at the side show 
 Believe that 
 'Cause it's real 
 This one goes out to my DJ Daryl-Ski 
 My homeboy L-o-c 
 And of course the jigga, the JED
