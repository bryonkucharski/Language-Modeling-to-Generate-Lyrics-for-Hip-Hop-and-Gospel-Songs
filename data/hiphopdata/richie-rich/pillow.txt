Lay your head on my pillow 
 And just relax, relax, relax 
 Lay your head on my pillow 
 And just relax, relax, relax 
 Here we are in the room together 
 Holding hands and it's gonna get better 
 And I know that you're in the mood, yes 
 So I put your purse down 
 And take off your jacket 
 Oh girl it's about to get nasty 
 You'll love what we gonna do 
 So lay your head on my pillow 
 And just relax, relax, relax 
 Lay your head on my pillow 
 And just relax, relax, relax 
 Lay your head on my pillow 
 And just relax, relax, relax 
 Lay your head on my pillow 
 And just relax 
 The cutie pies they all know 
 They can always lay on my pillow 
 The cutie pies they all know 
 They can always lay on my pillow 
 The cutie pies they all know 
 They can always lay on my pillow 
 They can always, they can always
