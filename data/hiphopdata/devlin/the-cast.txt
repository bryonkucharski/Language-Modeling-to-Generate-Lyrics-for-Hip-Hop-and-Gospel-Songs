We're all part of the moving picture 
 We're all part of the moving picture 
 We're all part of the moving picture 
 We're all part of the moving picture 
 Stay still while I finish the portrait 
 You are part of the picture now 
 Everybodys got roles to play 
 Inside of my picture house 
 The film premiere of life events that would pick me now 
 Somebody better sit me down 
 I'm too direct when I'm making a stand 
 Those who watched from afar 
 Thought the clock was a'fast 
 Those who watched me advance know how far that I've come from the past 
 Now this motion picture, ocean's bigger, I'm way too fast 
 You supported me in the awkward scenes, now you're part of the cast 
 We're all part of the moving picture 
 We're all part of the moving picture 
 We're all part of the moving picture 
 We're all part of the moving picture 
 This goes for the fans 
 Who stood by me from the day one 
 From tales of the crypt 
 The art of rolling and all that I've done 
 Bud, sweat and beers to here 
 It feels like I've already won 
 But if I had more luck, but now looks like the fortune the one 
 Thanks for the fans that followed me 
 And helped me in building a colony 
 You showed more fight than mars 
 The war God from roman mythology 
 Forget what the cameras capture 
 Because I'm the main character here 
 But believe me, I ain't actor 
 I'm just trying to write the next chapter 
 We're all part of the moving picture 
 We're all part of the moving picture 
 We're all part of the moving picture 
 We're all part of the moving picture 
 Thank you to everyone that played their part 
 And taking me from the bottom to the middle 
 To somewhere near the top 
 'Cause now you're all part of the cast (and the clock don't stop) 
 The last few years of my life 
 Have gone too quick 
 Pick from the bits and dangle with the life inside 
 A life full of paper, power and glyphs 
 I come from the real world, still I'm not sure what planet this is 
 I don't really feel well, I'm sick inside of insanity's grip 
 Make an action film for this 
 Leaving the drama, finding the grip 
 The lights below, I could be a father 
 But then I gave birth from this 
 Now you're a part of the picture 
 You got an insight into the scripture 
 You get it 
 My job here is done roll the end credits 
 Big love to every single one of my fans 
 And everyone who bought the tickets to one of my shows 
 Everyone that bought one of my CDs 
 Every download of any of my songs 
 Not about the mixtapes 
 OT crew
