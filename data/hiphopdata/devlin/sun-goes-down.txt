Hide to fight for my life, and nearly everything in it 
 This ain't just lyrics I'm bringing, I'm giving you insight into a world that I live in 
 Where if you don't stand up, man up, you might as well be dead in the seat that you sit in 
 I switch my life from an awkward position, I wanted more... than work and still being poor 
 I don't need criminologists proving that young men have acted like animals lately 
 Ain't that what you made this for, nothing inside but hatred and war 
 All I ever learn from policemen, was how to kick through a door 
 But I retain composure, now I can't stop 'til the sun burns out 
 Life as you know it is over, I used to run around town 
 Thinking of scams and plans 
 Now you see my face on a poster, you must have thought that I was a no hoper 
 Or a joker 
 I can't let your vision be 
 The only part that's made for me 
 'Cause when the sun goes down I gotta be 
 Content when I lay my head, I lay my head 
 Until the sun goes down, on every broken town that I'm rolling around 
 I'll have my heart in my palm and I'll show you my hand 
 'Cause no matter what happened you won't ever see me a broken man 
 My faculty grows on rations now we make dough an we share it around 
 I can feel a change in power, now life don't seem so sour 
 I used to sign on them ride on when I told myself 
 That I weren't gonna work 'til I'm old for means to an end one more bloody hour 
 So, say hello to my ex boss he's still getting up at half five for a shower 
 Times are crazy in my world is dreams a baby 
 I never did think that I would have been the best MC in the whole UK scene 
 'Til the sun goes down I'm a run this town like Rihanna and Jay-Z 
 There's no stopping me now, I'm a warrior now, I'm telling you, take heed 
 I can't let your vision be 
 The only part that's made for me 
 'Cause when the sun goes down I gotta be 
 Content when I lay my head, I lay my head 
 Until the sun no longer rises 
 The fall of mankind, the change of climates 
 You'll find me grinding, this life that I'm in 
 It's full of surprises, but you'll still find them fighting 
 Until the sun no longer rises 
 The fall of mankind, the change of climates 
 You'll find me grinding, this life that I'm in 
 It's full of surprises, but you'll still find them fighting 
 I can't let your vision be 
 The only part that's made for me 
 'Cause when the sun goes down I gotta be 
 Content when I lay my head, I lay my head
