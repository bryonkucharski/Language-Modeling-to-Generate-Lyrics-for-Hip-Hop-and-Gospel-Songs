Welcome to my ghost ship 
 The one I resurrected like the Black Pearl 
 And had it stay afloat in 
 And from the day I boarded on this vessel 
 I feel as though I've done a lap of every single ocean 
 And the seven seas too, but I got the wind on my sails and a good crew 
 Of men who grew up in the same neighborhood I knew 
 And I will turn to sail to where the sky's forever blue 
 Along the way I learned of lives I never knew 
 And I can't shut my mouth, who am I to hide the truth 
 But really, who am I, just a navigator 
 Guided by the north star and now my time is due 
 I'll keep floating down the river till you see a pale figure roll up saying how'd you do 
 I'm like Columbus with the compass 
 So let me move 
 I've been rowing down the river so long 
 And I don't even know where I belong 
 It's hard to find the right life in this song 
 It's like my head feels tired but my heart's still strong 
 As life goes on, the river takes me different places 
 The fight goes on 
 This ship's lowering it's anchors 
 'Cause I've been rolling down this river so long 
 So long, so long, I've been rolling down this river so long 
 So long, so long, I've been rolling down this river so long 
 So long, so long, I've been rolling down this river so long 
 So long, so long, I've been rolling down this river so long 
 I started in a raft, I made into a craft 
 Then I was gone at the rasing of the mast 
 I've seen pain behind my craft 
 Cross paths and I see your ship alike like the Cutty Sark 
 In the woods where the pirates throw 
 In the water where the pirates dwell 
 I never justify the odds I defied myself 
 I said I'll never make this, horrible scenario, shape shift, yeah 
 And all my crews got a few stars like a Orion's Belt 
 We make the pilgrimage here upon a river full of tears that were taken from lost souls 
 Left to cry in hell, a cry for help 
 Is what this started as, but now my life's sick like the psychotic pitbull it's barking mad 
 How I came from nothing, now I control the water ways your barge is banned 
 I've been rowing down the river so long 
 And I don't even know where I belong 
 It's hard to find the right life in this song 
 It's like my head feels tired but my heart's still strong 
 As life goes on, the river takes me different places 
 The fight goes on 
 This ship's lowering it's anchors 
 'Cause I've been rolling down this river so long 
 So long, so long, I've been rolling down this river so long 
 So long, so long, I've been rolling down this river so long 
 So long, so long, I've been rolling down this river so long 
 So long, so long, I've been rolling down this river so long 
 My mum gave birth south of the Thames 
 Then I float down to this ghost town, now I call my ends 
 Where a county starts and the city ends 
 And I learned to be careful when you're picking friends 
 Between the few men we had to build a boat 
 Lie it low, just to keep the dream afloat 
 A lot of people thought that it was washed up 
 Hence the reason why they looked like they've seen a ghost 
 Call me Brook, call me Black Beard or Davy Jones 
 One captain that will send your whole navy home 
 And I will never rest with my skeleton 
 Therefore it's relevant you'll never call me lazy bones 
 So welcome to my ghostship 
 That has promised me the one day it'll free my soul 
 So when the tide comes in upon the beat you know who knows 
 You know you might get to read my scrolls 
 I've been rowing down the river so long 
 And I don't even know where I belong 
 It's hard to find the right life in this song 
 It's like my head feels tired but my heart's still strong 
 As life goes on, the river takes me different places 
 The fight goes on 
 This ship's lowering it's anchors 
 'Cause I've been rolling down this river so long 
 So long, so long, I've been rolling down this river so long 
 So long, so long, I've been rolling down this river so long 
 So long, so long, I've been rolling down this river so long 
 So long, so long, I've been rolling down this river so long
