Devlin, yeah 
 Wretch 32 in the building 
 Let's take it back there, time to go in 
 Tell 'em Wretch, tell 'em Wretch 
 I'm on some off with your head shit 
 I keep firing, I'm not The Apprentice 
 Devs told me to go in, ah yeah 
 So I ran - blocked all the exits 
 Yes I'll be here forever 
 And tread so far I'll leave here in leather 
 So dark, so cold 
 With a couple girls sitting on my lap 
 I'm never gonna say I'm back 
 I'm a little too in love with plaques 
 I moved in to the hall of fame 
 So I wipe my feet on tracks 
 I'mma kill it, I'm a killer 
 See me with one glove, it's a Thriller 
 I already had a number one for my dinner 
 Me and Devs go in there, inner 
 And we're out of here, I doubt you're near 
 I've already been a thousand 'ere 
 But if you live for the money, then you die for the money 
 So I ain't even trying to count it, I swear 
 And if you don't think I'm fucked 
 Middle finger up 
 Fuck me, fuck you 
 I'll make you feel small when I big you up 
 Up, up and away, I can't see ya 
 On my own scale, I'm a Libra 
 Told 'em leave me alone, I wanna leave, uh 
 Had to give 'em some dough to get a pizza 
 Every day I have take away 
 Tomorrow won't be the same today 
 I don't score when I'm at home 
 I strike more when I play away 
 Shut down the asylum 
 Before I creep through the exit, find it 
 Jump any fence inside then drag a man 
 Out of the car that he just was driving 
 And then put the pedal to the floor 
 I'm back and I'm ready for the war like a Viking 
 I ain't gotta tell 'em any more, me and Wretch 
 Already killed this UK Grime thing 
 And there's not a lot left that could swing with Shipman 
 The doctor of death 
 Like Wretch 32 said it's off with his head 
 Got cold feet then it's frost on your creps 
 Never mind where you're walking, watch where you step 
 Mind what you're talking, I might dissect 
 Any guy trying a bullshit vibe on a sec 
 Can't fuck with me like my wife on the reds 
 Too unorthodox to let it go 
 So I let 'em know that I'm pro, but my name ain't Stephen 
 Soul seems to be involved 
 I'm burying men six deep in a hole, no reason 
 You're getting buried alive, I'm tryna better my life 
 While some men are cutting up suits 
 With scissors and severing ties 
 I let 'em know that it's Devlin's time 
 No disputing I shift to the move 
 This game from the days of The Movement 
 Using the only utensil I knew to 
 Now I need loot this, alike to my figures on YouTube 
 Retreat or advance then, you choose 
 At the present I'm king like Presley 
 Test me, then I'm running out full of anger 
 And envy and stamping you out in my blue shoes 
 Ride a beat like a Traktor, ey 
 But I ain't getting on a train, 'ey 
 Everybody wants to act up, yeah 
 'Til you put 'em in the frame 
 And I ain't got time for shit, patience's thinner than my toilet roll 
 I'm a fixed up brother from a broken home 
 I remember I used to watch Home Alone 
 Now I'm home alone in my own home 
 This millennium, got a loada dome 
 Rome then roam 
 Came home smelling like hot Cologne 
 Had a success overdose, oh 
 You see my roll-on flow 
 And I'm so sure that I can't be old 
 Yet all my heels I carry on toe to toe 
 When we take this game now, so cologne 
 You couldn't play my post 
 I'm an old soul like an ancient ghost 
 That created his name in the game and he 
 Took shit to another level on the whole 
 I can't really explain my brain 
 But if you peeked inside of my skull 
 You'd see shit so deep in my rear right lobe 
 That you'd know why I feel this cold 
 And I feel like the caped crusader 
 Here on the brink of a dangerous caper 
 I'm always collected and calm in battle 
 Can't be rattled, go sample a shaker 
 OT, I'm an out taker 
 I'm taking out any men that are minor 
 And think that they're major, there's a devil and a 
 Wretch that just broke out of the chamber 
 Yes, now I'm going for the hat-trick 
 One singer, one model, one actress 
 But I might disappear if you're acting 
 Or singing me a new tune on a mad pitch 
 Back to my rap shit 
 I'mma go hard this year 
 Can't be looking at the past this year 
 That won't help me get past this year 
 In an extra zone next to tracks 
 Multiple hits but with extra swag 
 I've divided my time 
 Royalties won't forget to add 
 And I ain't adding nobody on my BB 
 IPhone when I want you to see me 
 I played, YouTube 
 See me on Wretch32 TV 
 I'm getting flashbacks from the past 
 Head full of hate and a mouth full of bars 
 Me and Wretch just stretched this game to a next span 
 Taking the extra yard 
 We're going extra hard, no I can not be barred 
 Say what you want, but you couldn't keep Devs out 
 Anyways, I've already broke through the fence now 
 And I'm quite relentless when I vex out 
 Everybody wants to the the next out 
 But they get stripped like a bitch when her dress down 
 Think you're a face round 'ere? 
 Get left lying face down in a next town 
 Pull strings like Rory Lamont 
 On the beat and I'm dropping the bomb 
 I'll make you all feel sick like Sue Bo dropping her thong 
 This ain't Sumo but I'm too big and too strong
