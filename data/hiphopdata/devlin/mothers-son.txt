Every mom loves their son 
 Remember that the next time you're loading up the gun 
 Cock it back, make it throw in and you run 
 Breaking them and turn them holy at the sun 
 Then the Lord, Jesus and Mary Magdalen 
 But our mom's mind is below imagining 
 The subjects I'm tackling, left to cry tears when I scream, see this really happening 
 Every young soul that's killed in the field 
 Never perish to the hating pull to his own 
 This rap tool to his home, till his own home 
 To leave the marker on this first wounds talk broke 
 You can never really hurt one person 
 Only damage everything they ever know 
 So next time you see red, think slow 
 Before you strip another woman of her soul 
 We are just children trying to cope in 
 We crawl to our feet and we try to run 
 Won't be one of the fallen 
 Our love has just begun 
 In the end we're all just flash and blood, all set and done 
 We're all our mother's sons 
 Whether you're rich or poor 
 Live like a king or you're sleeping all alone, cold 
 Concrete floor, summer in the city 
 Nearly every man has a mother he adores 
 But when the time comes to leave the nest 
 We have to learn to fly alone and fight our own wars 
 For the trouble that will always be stars 
 Some man's right, but some close doors 
 Today is like I don't know what to say 
 Looking in the face the whole human race 
 In dismay I think that we forget 
 Who we evolved from the first drowns of DNA 
 Creating many types of men 
 Think as a fire as the men in different shades 
 Opinions, measurements, shapes 
 And though, within our mother's eyes we'll be great 
 We are just children trying to cope in 
 We crawl to our feet and we try to run 
 Won't be one of the fallen 
 Our love has just begun 
 In the end we're all just flash and blood, all set and done 
 We're all our mother's sons 
 Let me take the opportunity to say 
 I tell my loved ones I love them every day 
 Rule children of the planet trying to grow while the minutes slip away 
 Some try hard and fly for the flip off 
 Some strawl into glory like it's faith 
 But whatever life decides, the car dripping dope if you were to hate 
 We are just children trying to cope in 
 We crawl to our feet and we try to run 
 Won't be one of the fallen 
 Our love has just begun 
 In the end we're all just flash and blood, all set and done 
 We're all our mother's sons 
 We are just children trying to cope in 
 We crawl to our feet and we try to run 
 Won't be one of the fallen 
 Our love has just begun 
 In the end we're all just flash and blood, all set and done 
 We're all our mother's sons
