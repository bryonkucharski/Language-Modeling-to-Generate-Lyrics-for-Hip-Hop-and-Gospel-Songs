When the sky breaks it rains 
 So just let the H2O splash upon the graves 
 Of all the souls I used to know but now have passed away 
 Men say that time can heal a situation 
 But this pain is not a passing phase 
 Now I'm curious how many years a heart can ache 
 Feel like a Minotaur meandering this darkened place 
 Trying to find a way to maybe find the light of day 
 If I could rewind then I'd re-live my life again 
 And sit and hold my nan's hands while she felt the pain 
 And say hello to old mates behind the pearly gates 
 Given the chance to glance back at my childish face 
 I'd try and smile the way I smiled just like a child again 
 Before I had to say goodbye to anybody 
 And the loved ones I've lost all had life within their bodies 
 My side was less lonely then 
 You wanna cry well come and hold me then 
 I think I need the blessing of some holy man 
 'Cause everything is different now 
 I'd really like to tell you how 
 How I wanted you here by my side 
 I know what I said but I lied 
 It looked like I laughed but I cried 
 But I wish I could push rewind 
 If I had minutes on my hand just like a time piece 
 I'd turn the clocks back and maybe try to find peace 
 As well as my ID, so rewind me 
 Just like a video cassette 'cause I'm upset that I ain't seen 
 Some faces in a while just apparitions in my dream 
 That ends abruptly when they try to hug me through the screen 
 Of smoke that's engulfing me 
 Like the coastline with its high tide 
 And you can see the sands and the oceans meet 
 No one told me when this ride began to hold my seat 
 Time flies like Emmet Brown was in the driver's seat 
 You talk of irony 
 Well now I'm lonely 
 But I'm searching for my privacy 
 This life won't comply with me 
 I think I need some dead relatives either side of me 
 To keep me company and guide me through the library 
 Of never-ending stories full of lies and deceit 
 Hi Ho Silver, Lone Ranger riding to the beat 
 'Cause everything is different now 
 I'd really like to tell you how 
 How I wanted you here by my side 
 I know what I said but I lied 
 It looked like I laughed but I cried 
 But I wish I could push rewind 
 If I could rewind time to its slowest 
 I'd look at life at its heights and its lowest 
 So I could maybe try to recollect 
 What made me who I am besides a poet 
 Besides a poet 
 How I wanted you here by my side 
 I know what I said but I lied 
 It looked like I laughed but I cried 
 But I wish I could push rewind
