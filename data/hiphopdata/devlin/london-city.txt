Let your hair down in London City... everybody just keep 
 Moving with me. 
 Let your hair down in London City... everybody just keep 
 Moving with me. 
 Bud, sweat and beers! 
 And tonight we're in London city. 
 I'm on the A13 on the way to the city, where the lights 
 Are bright with some boys that like to fight, 
 I'm leaning. Out the window, smoking a spliffy. 
 Through the wind in my eyes, like tears that I cry, 
 Getting high on the essence of life. 
 Cause' tonight we're in London city. And I got bout' 400 
 With me... 
 15 minutes ago we left barking, now we're approaching 
 The city, I'm a laughing. 
 Wanna hit a restaurant first cause' I'm starving. Eat 
 Well for the start of emptying glasses. This is London 
 City. 
 The best city in the world when everybodys not shanking 
 And blasting, young men moving to music and females 
 Shaking their asses. 
 Let your hair down in London City, everybody just keep 
 Moving with me, just keep dancing with me, just keep 
 Rolling with me. 
 Let your hair down in London City, everybody just keep 
 Moving with me, just keep dancing with me, just keep 
 Rolling with me. 
 All right, I've finished my plate. Now I'm walking out 
 The restaurant, lighting up the cigarette and then I 
 Pass half to my mate. 
 Many clubs and bars await. We're gonna drink and dance 
 Till it's late. 
 And my name is Bait, so a lotta young ladies wanna 
 Glance at my face. One a' got a glass in their hand and 
 A wiggling their ass and their waist. 
 It's the old t-show, sexy ladies who wind down low. And 
 If ya get approached by a bloke, who smells of weed, 
 Smoke, don't act like you don't wanna know. 
 Cause' we got the city on smash. As the strobe lights 
 Flash, all I do is drink more champs and spend more 
 Cash... London City no match. 
 Let your hair down in London City, everybody just keep 
 Moving with me, just keep dancing with me, just keep 
 Rolling with me. 
 Let your hair down in London City, everybody just keep 
 Moving with me, just keep dancing with me, just keep 
 Rolling with me. 
 As the night comes to a closure I'm far from sober, but 
 I carry on drinking like a soldier, even when the night 
 Club's over. 
 Straight up in the morning and I still look smart but 
 I'm far from a poser. I'm sporting, Ralph Lauren, 
 Lacoste, Lyle and Scott 
 I'm 19 with more grades than my Dad's got and your 
 Girls still trying to watch. Well I guess my face just 
 Lights up the spots. 
 And now I'm pissed up running in the road, staggering, 
 Looking for a cab back to Bagenham to kick back and 
 Cotch, 
 With this sexy blue eyed brunnette girl that I got. 
 With the light in the cab it was more than a lot. 
 London City just pop. 
 Let your hair down in London City, everybody just keep 
 Moving with me, just keep dancing with me, just keep 
 Rolling with me. 
 Let your hair down in London City, everybody just keep 
 Moving with me, just keep dancing with me, just keep 
 Rolling with me. 
 ... London City just pop. 
 Let your hair down in London City...
