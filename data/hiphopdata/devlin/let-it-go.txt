(I will be gone before you wake 
 I will be gone before oh yes 
 I will be gone before you wake 
 I will be gone) 
 Listen, yeah carry on whinging and whining 
 And get left to regret what you said 
 I'll be out the door in a sec 
 Like Usain Bolt I'm quicker than lightening 
 I'm tired of irony 
 And hours on end, the bickering, fighting 
 I blame my surroundings 
 A relationship defined in violence 
 It blossomed, and it bloomed 
 Now it's rotten and I'm blue 
 And even though I still love you 
 I can't go through with the doom and the gloom again 
 That's the truth my friend 
 I'm not leaving for another lady 
 I felt I had to depart 
 'Cause if I didn't I'd kill you, maybe 
 Ah, everything fades away 
 The sun don't always glow 
 You can't go against the grain 
 You gotta let it go, let it go 
 Ah, everything fades away 
 The sun don't always glow 
 You gotta let it go, let it go 
 I just wanna be left alone, 
 It's time to let it go 
 I just wanna be left alone 
 I think it's time you let it go 
 The sun doesn't always shine 
 I'm stuck in a solar eclipse 
 Even though I love you to bits 
 I'm done with the pain that we both inflict 
 Upon one another 
 It don't make me happy to watch you suffer 
 Run back to your mother 
 Tell her I turned out the same as the others 
 I don't know how to handle ya 
 All you do is make me angrier 
 Till I wanna manhandle ya 
 I'm contemplating whether to kiss ya or strangle ya 
 But I can't put my hands on ya 
 Like a burning flame in the burning flames 
 In hell if I did so I'm walkin' away 
 I can no longer stand with ya 
 You took me high you took me low 
 You sold your soul with lies you told 
 And now it's time to ride alone 
 The lights will guide me home 
 The more I gave, the more you take 
 Now I'll be gone before you wake 
 'Cause I just can't ignore my fate 
 Forget the day you saw my face 
 (I will be gone) 
 In the blink of an eye 
 (I will be gone) 
 With the stars in the sky 
 (I will be gone) 
 And you're askin me why 
 (I will be gone before you)
