I've been here for a period of time 
 So long that my brain has gone delirious inside 
 I think back on all the years that I've survived 
 Holding back the tears that keep appearing in my eyes 
 But now I'm yesterday's news 
 And I'm tomorrow's promise but I've got my mince pies 
 Open wide trying to visualize devils in disguise 
 Devz I'm like Picasso 'cause I've been through every shade of blue 
 I'm walking under rainy skies but the flame never died 
 It stayed alive 'cause I was made to ignite 
 Like dynamite I'm from the cold with heavy night 
 I'm riding tight notice flows slip and slide 
 Like a tire in the snow cause there ain't no grip on ice 
 I'm cold in the Moscow and it's minus 29 
 So welcome to my life, I've cleverly designed minds 
 Lost souls just trying to live the higher life 
 I've been here so long through the sadness and the blues 
 But it's funny how I'm still here, with the government and yesterday's news 
 I've been here so long through the sadness and the blues 
 But it's funny how I'm still here, with the government and yesterday's news 
 Devilin, I'm dangerous I'm dead guys 
 And every week forgotten like yesterday's headlines 
 I've been through the blues just like Elvis' best time 
 But I ain't wearing suede shoes, I've just got the best rhymes 
 I refuse to die, you could attempt to kill me twenty times 
 But I'll still rise like I'm the day walker Wesley Snipes 
 So let me stick my teeth into the game and bleed it dry 
 When I witness blood seeking through his veins 
 This has become apparent I've got a talent that these other rappers haven't 
 So what would be the point of bloody keeping it in chains 
 About my rhymes but when I'm talking about? 
 So cut the conversation 'cause I've been lower rating 
 Taking anything I'm pleasing taking off the aviation 
 To a better place in time better for leaving this place behind 
 I've been here so long, through the sadness and the blues 
 But it's funny how I'm still here, with the government and yesterday's news 
 I've been here so long, through the sadness and the blues 
 But it's funny how I'm still here, with the government and yesterday's news 
 I can't see no reason why I can't retain success 
 I just need a real good time away from all this stress 
 I can't see no reason why I can't retain success 
 I just need a real good time away from all this stress 
 I've been here so long, through the sadness and the blues 
 But it's funny how I'm still here, with the government and yesterday's news 
 I've been here so long, through the sadness and the blues 
 But it's funny how I'm still here, with the government and yesterday's news
