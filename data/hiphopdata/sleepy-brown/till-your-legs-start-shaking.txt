Uh uh uh, You know it's on right... 
 Now that I've got you home with me tonight 
 They say I'd rather love 'cause this feels so right 
 I'm on top of you, you're under me 
 There's no place in this world that I'd rather be 
 Ooh 
 I got my arms upon your legs as 
 You hold on girl don't be scared just 
 Tell me the secrets in your head as 
 I get into you 
 Must express your every motion 
 Fallen deep in who I chosen 
 You keep tellin' me keep going 
 I know what to do 
 I won't stop till your legs start shaking 
 Keep on going till your legs start shaking 
 Every motion till your legs start shaking 
 To what I know till your legs start shaking 
 You're so good till your legs start shaking 
 Like I knew it boo till your legs start shaking 
 I don't stop till your legs start shaking 
 Till I reach the top till your legs start shaking 
 Ooh now that the moment's here 
 Baby lift my cup for you to drink my dear, Baby 
 Ooh I know that you're lovin' me 
 Don't be ashamed baby, go on and take that thang 
 Now that you're on top of me and 
 I caught up in your ecstacy and 
 I know that you're feeling me and 
 Every part of you 
 Must express your every motion 
 Fallen deep in who I chosen 
 I keep tellin' you keep going 
 You know what to do 
 Shake it baby shake it baby, ooh 
 Shake it baby shake it baby 
 Ooh 
 You are so fine 
 So divine (I love you so) 
 Shake it baby shake it baby 
 Shake it baby shake it baby 
 I'll never let you go 
 I'ma keep on hit me till your legs start shaking 
 Till your legs start shaking [x4] 
 (Chorus: till end)
