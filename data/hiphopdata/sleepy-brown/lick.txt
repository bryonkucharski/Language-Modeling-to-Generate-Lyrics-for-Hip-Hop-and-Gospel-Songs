I lose all control 
 When you grab a hold 
 And you do your trick 
 I love it when you lick 
 Lick 
 You've got lock and key 
 Every part of me 
 Know what makes me tick 
 I love it when you lick 
 Lick 
 I'll put my heels on for you baby 
 The ones that wrap all around my leg 
 Your every touch excites me 
 And damnit I ain't too proud to beg 
 And even when you're not around me 
 The tingling just won't go away 
 Don't make my body wait no longer 
 Because this pussycat's ready to play play play play play 
 I lose all control 
 When you grab a hold 
 And you do your trick 
 I love it when you lick 
 Lick 
 You've got lock and key 
 Every part of me 
 Know what makes me tick 
 I love it when you lick 
 Love it when you lick 
 Lick 
 It feels so good I'm going crazy 
 My eyes roll back inside my head 
 Explore my inner warmths of pleasure 
 And hold on tight 
 Hope you ain't scared 
 I promise I'll return the favor 
 I'll do that trick you can't resist 
 Two rights don't make it wrong 
 Makin' love till the break of dawn 
 Emotions all up in a twist twist twist twist twist 
 I lose all control 
 When you grab a hold 
 And you do your trick 
 I love it when you lick 
 Lick 
 You've got lock and key 
 Every part of me 
 Know what makes me tick 
 I love it when you lick 
 Lick 
 I'll put my heels on for you baby 
 The ones that wrap all around my leg 
 Your every touch it just excites me 
 And damnit I ain't too proud to beg 
 And even when you're not around me 
 The tingling, the tingling won't go away 
 Don't make my body wait no longer 
 Because this pussycat's ready to play play play play play 
 Oh oh sing 
 Da da da da da da da da 
 Da da da da da 
 Ba da ba ba ba 
 Ba ba 
 Ba ba 
 Ba ba 
 I lose all control 
 When you grab a hold 
 And you do your trick 
 I love it when you lick 
 Lick 
 You've got lock and key 
 Every part of me 
 Know what makes me tick 
 I love it when you lick
