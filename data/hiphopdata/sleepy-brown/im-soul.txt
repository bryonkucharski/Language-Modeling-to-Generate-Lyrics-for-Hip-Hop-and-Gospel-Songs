Unh... yeah... you know uh... it's the A baby... 
 It's me (watch me) it's me (watch me) 
 It's me (watch me) it's me (watch me) 
 It's me (watch me) it's me (watch me) 
 It's me (girl, I'm so) 
 (Soul) so real (soul) so fly 
 (Soul) so wise (soul) so right 
 (I'm soul) so grown (soul) so on 
 (Soul) so on (soul) 
 Cadillac night and caramel cake 
 Sittin' on vogues with golden flakes 
 Kangol tilted t'wards yo' way 
 Ridin' slow down M.L.K. 
 I'm soul... I'm soul 
 That's soul... that's soul 
 A-Town's gleamin' 'cross my face 
 Everybody's watchin' me 
 Say pretty lady, are you hungry 
 We can go somewhere get some buff'lo wings 
 That's soul... that's soul 
 I'm soul... I'm soul 
 Later on we can do our thing 
 Sippin' while we're cuddling 
 Baby makin' love by the fireplace 
 While I'm whisperin' in yo' ear 
 I'm soul... I'm soul 
 That's soul... that's soul 
 (Bridge: female singers) 
 You know that he's the soulest brother in the A, Town 
 The girls call him Pat, or Sleepy Brown 
 He got a mean ass walk, straight gangsta stroll 
 When he walks through the girls point they toes 
 'Cause they love him (I love him) 'cause they love him (I love him) 
 'Cause they love him (I love him) 'cause they love him (I love him) 
 'Cause they love him (I love him) 'cause they love him (I love him) 
 'Cause they love him (I love him) 'cause they love him (I love him) 
 Women want, men wanna be 
 Oh so clean from my head to my feet 
 Out here hustlin', on these streets 
 Ain't nobody bad like me 
 I'm soul... I'm soul 
 That's soul... that's soul 
 If you hatin' gon' yo' way 
 If you want me here's where I stay 
 Where everybody knows my name 
 When you see me baby, throw up the A 
 I'm soul... I'm soul 
 That's soul... that's soul 
 (Music to end)
