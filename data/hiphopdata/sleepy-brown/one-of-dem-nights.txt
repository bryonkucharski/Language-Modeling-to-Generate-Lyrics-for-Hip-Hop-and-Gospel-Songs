Everybody's ready, time to get it 
 'Cause it's 'bout to be ('bout to be) One of dem nights 
 Hope you keep it steady, time to get it 
 'Cause it's 'bout to be ('bout to be) One of dem nights 
 (It's about to be) one of dem nights (one of dem nights) 
 One of dem nights ('bout to be) One of dem nights 
 (It's about to be) one of dem nights, one of dem nights 
 (You will see) One of dem nights 
 It's time to get it on, we got it laid out for you 
 Whatever turns you on (on) 
 Don't stop from dusk till dawn, even then we'll keep partyin' 
 And vibin' to this song 
 Whatever your groove, we got it (all right) 
 Ain't nobody leavin' 'cause it's time to get on board 
 We're gonna groove, till morning 
 If you got to leave then you just might as well go home 
 'Cause it's one of dem nights 
 Everybody's ready, time to get it 
 'Cause it's 'bout to be (it's 'bout to be) One of dem nights 
 Hope you keep it steady, time to get it 
 'Cause it's 'bout to be, One of dem nights (it's about to be) 
 One of dem nights, one of dem nights ('bout to be) 
 One of dem nights (it's about to be) 
 One of dem nights (one of dem nights), one of dem nights (you will see) 
 One of dem nights 
 Can't you tell by the moon, that it's a special evenin'? 
 We're about to leave real soon (soon) 
 These here say shubble acts, that you're about to witness 
 Girl ain't no turnin' back 
 Music, Bridge 2: 
 One of dem nights, one of dem nights 
 One of dem nights 
 One of dem nights, one of dem nights 
 One of dem nights 
 (Music to end)
