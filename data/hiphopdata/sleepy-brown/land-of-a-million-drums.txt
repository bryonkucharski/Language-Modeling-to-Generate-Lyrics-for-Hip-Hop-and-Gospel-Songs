In the land of a million drums 
 There is always something going on, on, on, on 
 If you can't locate your thought off 
 Might as well go on take your dead home, home, home, home 
 In the land of a million drums 
 I catch a pattern that spit rings around you like Saturn 
 Intergalactic tracks, I make 'em like magstrulium 
 This one for Scooby, pass the doobie I'mma do me one, do me one 
 Only you clean over 
 I pick up the mic and rock it while I'm sober 
 For the rated G exposure if you listen to what I'm tryin' to told ya 
 We fathers with seeds of our own 
 We're talking about sons and daughters boy, not roots and clones 
 Now that the theory gone wrong 
 An embryo with no soul 
 Stuck in this green mini-van with my lungs in a choke hold 
 Shaggy, pass the bombastic 
 Daphne said, "Don't do that" 
 Freaky Fred smashed the gas and slammed us into traffic 
 Now Scrappy want to box and throw them bows 
 So I had to sic the pitbull on him before he could pass one blow 
 Scooby-Doo, Scooby-Doo, Scooby-Doo, Scooby-Doo (Scooby-Doobie-Doo) 
 In the land of a million drums 
 There is always something going on, on, on, on 
 Woke up from a long night of hanging out with Shaggy 
 Oh no, lost my last baggy of Scooby snackies 
 Shaggy, wake up, we've been had 
 Our Scooby snacks, they got the whole stash 
 He said, "Who who, I don't have a clue" 
 I suspect the thirteen ghosts of Scooby-Doo 
 Call Vincent Price up on the Nextel 
 Tell him to send another package right through the mail 
 In the meantime, I'mma call Thelma to tell her 
 To get the Mystery Machine ready 
 I'm two-wayin' Daphne and Freddy 
 Me and Shaggy dressed in all black, strapped 
 Dippin' through the flash, tryin' to get our stash back 
 Roundin' up suspects, collectin' clues 
 I got a question, where the hell is Scooby-Doo when you need 'em 
 The hound's only found when you feed him 
 In fact he probably got my sack 
 Tell him holler back 
 In the land of a million drums 
 There is always something going on, on, on, on 
 If you can't locate your thought off 
 Might as well go on take your dead home, home, home, home 
 Break it down, break it down baby, till the flow jumps off the ground 
 Oh break it down, lookin' over yonder till the walls come tumblin' down 
 Oh, yes lord why ain't gotta tell me two times but you know I know 
 Oh, break it down, break it down baby, 'cause I want why y'all all to know 
 We rock the world 
 (Repeat: x5) 
 I could of got away with it, if it wasn't for ya meddlin' kids 
 (Oh no, oh no)
