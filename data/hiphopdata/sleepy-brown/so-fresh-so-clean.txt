 Sir luscious got gator belts and patty melts and Monte Carlo's 
 And El Dorado's I'm waking up out of my slumber feeling like Ralo 
 So follow it's your time at the Apollo 
 Minus the kiki shepard what about a ho in a leopard print 
 Teddy pender gra** cooler than Freddie Jackson 
 Sippin a milkshake in a snowstorm 
 Left my throat warm in the dorm room at the AU 
 We do hey you and might do some cake too 
 But you must have me mistaken with them statements that you make 
 'Cause 
 Ain't nobody dope as me I'm just so fresh so clean

 Canary yellow seven house of business on display 
 My n**** bungle whipped it up so I gone get my rims today 
 So a n**** can ride out to the colorful hideout 
 I'm a show you how to wild out like Jack Trippa 
 Let me be bambino on your snippas 
 YKK on yo zippa lick you like a lizard 
 When I'm slizzard or sober six million ways to fold ya 
 Like Noah I get crews to choose and you get pretty deep 
 But I'll call yo ass round eightish I know you'll be there for me 
 'Cause 
 Ain't nobody dope as me I'm just so fresh so clean

 Those huge baby eyes get to runnin' off at they mouth 
 Tellin' me everything that's on yo nasty mind 
 They say your malnutrition in need of vitamin D 
 And inviting me to that tingle in yo' spines 
 I love who you are love who ya ain't you so Anne Frank 
 Let's hit the attic to hide out for bout two weeks 
 With change and no chains and whips I do suck lips 
 Till hips jerk and double time the boy next door's a freak 
 Ha ha 
 Ain't nobody dope as me I'm just so fresh so clean 
 (So fresh and so clean clean) 
 Don't you think I'm so sexy I'm just so fresh so clean

 (And we are) 
 The coolest motherfunkers on the planet 
 (In my mind) 
 The sky is fallin' ain't no need to panic 
 (But oh oh) 
 I got a stick and want yo' automatic 
 (Oh oh oh) 
 Compatible created in the attic
