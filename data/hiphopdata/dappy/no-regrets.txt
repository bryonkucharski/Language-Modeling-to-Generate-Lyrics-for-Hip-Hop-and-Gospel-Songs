Ooh-oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh 
 Na Na Na Na Na (x2) 
 Ooh-oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh 
 Hear me out... 
 This is my king's speech, I'm nowhere near the end, 
 If I s-stutter... Sorry, I ain't heaven's sent, 
 I messed my life up, yeah I've been down, 
 I'm a changed man now... Chris Brown, 
 Ya know I feel your pain 'cause I done been through it, 
 I'm Kurt Cobain but I just couldn't do it, 
 No point in turning back, just to hit rewind, 
 Back To The Future... Ma... Marty McFly, 
 Inside, there's a fire 'cause I'm no longer looking in a reflection that I admire, 
 I paint a picture of a fighter 
 But there's no one looking back at me since I'm a liar, 
 If I should die before I wake... The least that I could ever say, 
 I made mistakes but held on to my faith... 
 'Cause when I look in a mirror... I don't even recognize myself, 
 Got the heart of a winner... but looking back at me is someone else. 
 No Regrets (x2), 
 No point in crying over yesterday 
 Eh 
 No Regrets (x2), 
 'Cause we ain't even seen the best of days 
 Ooh-oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh Na Na Na Na Na 
 Ooh-oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh 
 This is my last chance, I'm on my final straw, 
 I came so close to b-breaking like a spinal chord, 
 I came from nothing... Some kid in Camden, 
 Now I'm flying with the birds... Richard Branson, 
 I'm a prince... Yes I will... Get the crown, 
 Kate stays in my dungeon when her sister's round, 
 So please forgive me... If I make mistakes, 
 But I'll blow the bloody doors off... Michael Caine 
 If I should die before I wake... The least that I could ever say, 
 I made mistakes but held on to my faith... 
 Oh, 
 'Cause when I look in a mirror... I don't even recognize myself, 
 Got the heart of a winner... but looking back at me is someone else. 
 No Regrets (x2), 
 No point in crying over yesterday 
 Eh 
 No Regrets (x2), 
 'Cause we ain't even seen the best of days 
 I'm free to be whatever I... 
 'Cause I'm famous... Call me Gallagher... 'Cause I'm so shameless, 
 The papers sold a page at the cost of my failures, 
 Victimised by the public... don't know if I can take this, 
 So I sing "So when you feel like there's no more nothing left but the life you've broken." 
 No regrets... No turning back... Pick up yourself and tell them I'm just being me... 
 'Cause when I look in a mirror... I don't even recognize myself, 
 Got the heart of a winner... but looking back at me is someone else. 
 No Regrets (x2), 
 No point in crying over yesterday 
 Eh 
 No Regrets (x2), 
 No Regrets... 
 'Cause when I look in a mirror... I don't even recognize myself, 
 Got the heart of a winner... but looking back at me is someone else. 
 No Regrets (x2), 
 No point in crying over yesterday 
 Eh 
 No Regrets (x2), 
 'Cause we ain't even seen the best of days 
 'Cause when I look in a mirror... I don't even recognize myself, 
 Got the heart of a winner... but looking back at me is someone else. 
 No... No. Nobody crying over yesterday.
