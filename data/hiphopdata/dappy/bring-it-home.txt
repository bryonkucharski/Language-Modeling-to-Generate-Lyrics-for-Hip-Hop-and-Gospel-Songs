We are, we are, 
 We are, we are the only ones 
 That can bring it, bring it home 
 We are, we are, 
 We are, we are the only ones 
 This is an invasion, 
 The unwanted kind 
 I'm all about domination 
 That's my state of mind 
 I'm gonna build an empire 
 So what's yours is mine 
 We're gonna take it home tonight 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 Lets make this one to remember 
 We're blowing up the sky, like the fifth of November 
 We don't stop 'cause we're impatient 
 The anticipation is pumpin', pumpin', pumpin' 
 Carry the light 
 From the fire 
 I can see it burning in your eyes 
 Do or die 
 We're crossing the light 
 There's no where left to hide 
 Tell me what you're waiting for 
 What you're living for 
 We're bringing it home 
 Oh oh oh 
 No one's left behind 
 You're not alone 
 'Cause we are, we are, 
 We are, we are the only ones 
 That can bring it, bring it home 
 'Cause we are, we are, 
 We are, we are the only ones 
 When I'm gone will you miss me? 
 We'll find out in time 
 I'm gonna go down in history 
 As the one who changed your mind 
 They said that I'm dangerous 
 So what's yours is mine 
 We're gonna take this 
 Home tonight 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 Lets make this one to remember 
 We're blowing up the sky like the fifth of November 
 We don't stop 'cause we're impatient 
 The anticipation is pumpin', pumpin', pumpin' 
 Carry the light 
 From the fire 
 I can see it burning in your eyes 
 Do or die 
 We're crossing the light 
 There's no where left to hide 
 Tell me what you're waiting for 
 What you're living for 
 We're bringing it home 
 Oh oh oh 
 No one's left behind 
 You're not alone 
 'Cause we are, we are, 
 We are, we are the only ones 
 That can bring it, bring it home 
 'Cause we are, we are, 
 We are, we are the only ones 
 Right here where you're meant to be 
 I'm gonna get my hands on you officially 
 I swear life's a bitch 
 And mine's called victory 
 That's why I always come first literally 
 There ain't another like your kind 
 All eyes on the prize but you're mine 
 Never give up on something you can't go a day 
 Without thinking about 
 Just carry the light 
 From the fire 
 I can see it burning in your eyes 
 Do or die 
 We're crossing the line 
 There's no where left to hide 
 Tell me what you're waiting for 
 What you're living for 
 We're bringing it home 
 Oh oh oh 
 No one's left behind 
 You're not alone 
 'Cause we are, we are, 
 We are, we are the only ones 
 That can bring it, bring it home 
 'Cause we are, we are, 
 We are, we are the only ones 
 That can bring it, bring it home
