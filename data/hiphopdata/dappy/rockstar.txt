They say that I'm dangerous 
 Like everything I touch falls apart 
 If I were to tell, they'll kill me now 
 Well imma cut to the chase 
 I used to wish on a star but nowadays I need space: Satellites 
 See the black shades white chain, flashing lights 
 Never thought I could have felt this low in the highlights 
 So I asked Phyllis its still another day in paradise 
 Is the heaven for the forever 27 
 Could it be three years till I'm jammin' with legends? 
 I got thousands of fans, but I don't get the obsession 
 There's a nice guy inside, I guess I've never met him 
 'Cause I could buy a fast car But not even an aeroplane can seem to get me out of here 
 The pressure and the stress are both dying to see the end of me 
 And the man in the mirror is looking at me like an enemy 
 Whoa 
 What doesn't kill you makes you stronger every time 
 Naahoo 
 Don't let 'em tell you how to live your life, causee 
 They say that I'm dangerous 
 Like everything I touch it falls apart 
 If I were to tell, they'll kill me now 
 Well imma cut to the chase 
 'Cause I'm living like a Rockstar 
 I ain't afraid the good die young 
 'Cause I be living like a rockstar 
 I blow up a million miles away, away, away 
 Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh 
 Chicka BANG BANG 
 Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh 
 Chicka BANG BANG 
 Mama always told that there's someone looking over me 
 Think she meant the guy with the camera tryna photo me 
 Be careful what you wish for, cause the truths a little different 
 If the Guardian's my angel, why's the Sun burning holes in me? 
 They let me loose on the public, but I didn't prepare 
 I get shock by a lens every time I appear 
 Put a star in the room, I swear it changes the atmosphere 
 'Cause I'm a celebrity, can someone get me out of here 
 Whoa 
 What doesn't kill you makes you stronger every time 
 Naahoo 
 Don't let 'em tell you how to live your life, causee 
 They say that I'm dangerous 
 Like everything I touch it falls apart (ooh like everything I touch it falls apart) 
 If I were to tell, they'll kill me now 
 Well imma cut to the chase 
 'Cause I'm living like a Rockstar (Yesss I ammm!) 
 I ain't afraid the good die young (whoa oh oh oh) 
 'Cause I be living like a rockstar 
 I blow up a million miles away, away, away 
 'Cause I don't care, I don't care 
 Take me there, take me thaere 
 Na na na I ain't scared, I ain't scared 
 Take me there 
 Well Imma cut to the chase 'cause I be living like a 
 You ain't a legend till your set in stone 
 For now your just flesh and bone 
 Just a likkle bruder tryna build a home 
 I'll be the best till my dying breath: Brian Jones 
 A wise girl once sung tears dry on their own 
 Fuck a moment of silence in my house 
 We shut the whole shit down for Winehouse 
 So I've got something to say 
 Take aim, pull the trigger 
 Cause your never going to blow me away (Awwway, ooh whoa) 
 They say that I'm dangerous 
 Like everything I touch it falls apart 
 If I were to tell, they'll kill me now 
 Well imma cut to the chase 
 'Cause I'm living like a Rockstar 
 I ain't afraid to die young 
 'Cause I be living like a rockstar 
 I blow up a million miles away 
 'Cause I don't care, I don't care 
 Take me there, take me thaere 
 Na na na I ain't scared, I ain't scared 
 Take me there 
 Well we can cut to the chase 'cause I'm living like a 
 'Cause I'm living like a rockstar! 
 Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh 
 Chicka BANG BANG 
 Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
