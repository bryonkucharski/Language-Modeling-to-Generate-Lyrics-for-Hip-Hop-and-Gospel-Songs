Live from the Apple 
 Slicing the American pie 
 With dope lyrics 
 Watch me get America high 
 By your appearance I can get a glimpse of your vibe 
 They say you are what you wear, I am Yves Saint Laurent 
 Mixing Martin Margiella 
 Catch me at the Montreyon 
 Fella I'm getting money that's why you all jealous 
 This ain't a rap song, this is a rap psalm 
 Immaculate so I'ma be the first to cast on 
 In kindergarten I was filling out my tax form 
 While my other class mates was learning Jimmy Crack Corn 
 ? How can I go broad, riding shot gun with Lupe through Chicago hood 
 Hat tilted to the side like a GD bumping a Pac CD 
 Picture me rollin' holla when you see me 
 This easy sorta like my ABC's 
 And I'll take another ? nigga 1, 2, 3 
 Know my name when I spell, it's D-I two G's 
 Rather die before I'm telling see I'm too G 
 Digg is like 
 Life or death 
 I'm a rebel 
 My poetry's deep I never fell 
 Digg is like 
 Half man half amazing 
 Digg is like 
 Life or death 
 I'm a rebel 
 My poetry's deep I never fell 
 Digg is like 
 Half man half amazing 
 It's the return of the light skin 
 Okay all right then 
 The king on my name is separated by a hyphen 
 Looking at my Breitling it's about that time 
 Stunting like a Badboy out the Porsche just shine 
 Gotta rap like a peda stomp a rat in front of pedo 
 When its comes to cooking heaters I'm a baker like I need her 
 Can't come up ? like a phone off the receiver 
 I know you're all eager to see me compete with Bieber 
 Not knowing that's my homie, we chilling kicking our feet up 
 Don't do business with a worker so direct me to your leader 
 In a few years I'll be the chairman of ?, Warner, Elektra, Atlantic, re-up 
 And when I go watch the money go pre-nup 
 We going hard in the paint nigga D-up 
 Try to bring the heat and you'll still lose if y'all team up 
 This is for my fly niggas jetsetters we are
