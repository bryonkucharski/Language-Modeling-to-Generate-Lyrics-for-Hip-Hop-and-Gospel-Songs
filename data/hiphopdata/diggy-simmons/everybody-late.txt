Y'all better catch up right now 
 Before y'all all get left out (yeah... get em!) 
 Jet Setters general 
 Eatin' these niggas-cannibal 
 Eat 'em like they got ham on em 
 Literally go ham on em 
 I'm an animal, snappin just like a camera 
 Give me a minute Imma mop up these rappers up like janitor 
 Didn't know? You know now 
 This is how it goes down 
 You a clown. I got more niggas than you do in your town 
 Take a chance. I did. 
 A nigga put his hands on me 
 And that'll be the last thing he do 
 Atlantic, filling up my planner 
 Getting ready to have the whole world in a panic 
 Imma get it. New York City know I put it down 
 Tell Amare Stoudemire I said welcome to my house 
 Here we go. I'm fly when I'm fly 
 Don't matter what I wear when I'm on that G5 
 And I don't even try 'cause it's in my design 
 And I know that deep down that you pray on my demise 
 Diggy! 
 See me coming, everybody wait 
 I'll be, I'll be on that early 
 Everybody late 
 See me coming, everybody wait 
 I'll be I'll be on early 
 Everybody late 
 Get it poppin'. Get it, get it poppin' 
 Get it poppin'. Get it, get it poppin' 
 Get it poppin'. Get it, get it poppin' 
 Get it poppin'. Get it, get it poppin' 
 You ain't rockin' thos 
 Red and guacamol 
 Gucci slippers when I'm chillin' in Galapagos 
 Yeah I'm on a boat, somewhere in Pacific coast 
 Just updated my status 
 I ain't need no post 
 Acting hard, when you a male Ke$ha 
 Hot steppin in your Sketchers 
 You a square, L-7 
 Put the L up to your heaven 
 Raise your 11s to the heavens 
 Make a promise you won't be a lame in 2011, ha! 
 I'm the real deal, you a make shift 
 Holiday, you only get busy on occasions 
 I'm a problem. You not in the equation 
 A little nigga hungry, got munchies but I ain't blazin' 
 From stages to stages 
 20 thou for an hour that's a basic 
 I'm still on with the squad that I came with 
 The only Mohican left; the last of the greatest.
