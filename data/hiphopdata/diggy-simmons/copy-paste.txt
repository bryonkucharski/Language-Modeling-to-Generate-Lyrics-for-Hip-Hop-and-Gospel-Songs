Uh, it's Diggy 
 Queens, you with me? 
 Yeah, let's get it, let's get it 
 Uh, check my million dollar swag 
 I tell 'em 10-4 'cause they wanna copy that, uh 
 In the mall, lotta shopping bags 
 Baby girl, what you want? Your boy got the tab 
 If ya man say, "Where you at?" 
 I'ma tell 'em, "I ain't seen her" 
 Better hit her on the jag 
 She's gone for the evening 
 I make 'em lean back Don Cartagena 
 Yeah, you know what's up Martin, Tommy, Gina 
 I'ma leader like Derek Jeter, they copy my demeanor 
 I'd be jocking I know they're watching, they act like I don't see 'em 
 I'll never stop 
 Keep me on the job and they be tryna 
 Copy and paste me, copy and paste me 
 I'm on and I be in my zone and they be tryna 
 Copy and paste me, copy and paste me 
 I'm gone 
 My shoe game look here I'm rockin' 'em 
 Moccasins or go Jeremy Scott on 'em 
 Louboutin look like they got spots on it 
 My ratings up cause everybody watching it 
 I be V.I.P., you on line where the rope is 
 Don't come any closer, you might step on my cultures 
 Ladies it's your jam leave you jacket on the sofa 
 Have a little class, put your glass up on the coaster 
 Get it on the floor shake it 
 Shake it like you're supposed to 
 If you know getting over 
 Tell 'em copy, copy, over 
 I'll never stop 
 Keep me on the job and they be tryna 
 Copy and paste me, copy and paste me 
 I'm on and I be in my zone and they be tryna 
 Copy and paste me, copy and paste me 
 I'm gone 
 Copy, paste 
 Copy, copy, paste 
 Everything that I do, they tryna do the same 
 (The same thing) 
 Copy, paste 
 Copy, copy, paste 
 Tryna do it how I do it, they can't do it like me 
 (Do it like me) 
 Copy paste, copy, copy, paste, copy, copy, paste 
 Copy, copy, copy

 Copy, copy, paste
