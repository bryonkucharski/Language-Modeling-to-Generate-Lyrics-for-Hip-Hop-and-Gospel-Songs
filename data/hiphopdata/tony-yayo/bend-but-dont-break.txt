 Bend but don't break give before you take 
 Always look 'em right in the eye 
 These are words to live by 
 Jim proposed to Sue she said I do 
 They eloped into a summer's night 
 Heading for Loredo that's the way wind blew 
 They got in their first real fight 
 Standing at the alter shoes and her halter 
 Jim sweating out his Sunday best 
 Looking all around them but nobody found them 
 And this is what the preacher said 
 Bend but don't break give before you take 
 Always look 'em right in the eye 
 Always have a reason dress right for the season 
 Never cheat and never lie 
 These are words to live by 
 Billy's washing dishes and all the time he wishes he could find a better way 
 Yeah and no season had rain for a country singer bound for a life of that fortune and fame 
 He wrote a couple songs and they got a long into the hands of a bad Nashville man 
 Playin' on the radio and he ain't never seen no doe 
 Looks back down at them ugly pots and pans 
 You know times in our life are nervous and reckless, sometimes it's hard just to get by 
 Ain't it good to know that we can still grow So gimme one word and tell me one time 
 Always me and mother and never were no other Daddy died when I was just three 
 Always understood that she did the best she could I needed someone right there Momma would be 
 I never thought twice to ask for advice when I got crazy in my head 
 What ever the 'cause she would slowly pause And this is what Momma said
