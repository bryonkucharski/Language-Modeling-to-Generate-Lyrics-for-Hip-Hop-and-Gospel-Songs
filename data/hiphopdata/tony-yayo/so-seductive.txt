 Got your bitch on my dick I stack them chips 
 And a flash as a fuck my jewels so sick 
 From a block away you can see them kid 
 Don't front mothafucka you know my style

 And you know I'm feelin' to take her back to the crib 
 Here we go imma show her how a playa live 
 At the door I tell her to take her clothes off... shit

 If I wake up next to her in the morning 
 I'm a turn over and tell her let's do it again

 The way that she move makin' me horny 
 If I wake up next to her in the morning

 (Tony yayo verse) 
 I put the g in g-unit baby I got game 
 Head to go good to go and I don't know your name 
 Is it the wheels on the hot car meals on the shock bar 
 Or you just wanna quickie with a rap star 
 Ladies tell the truth you know I'm cute 
 But what really turns you on is the rims on my coupe 
 Before you jump in my whip and you get dropped off 
 You goin' to the telly and you gettin' popped off 
 I can't stop thinkin' of the things you do 
 When your freakin me and I'm freakin you 
 I said the ice on my neck make the shortys stare 
 Baby let me fly you in my lair 
 Stop slow down baby if you hear this in the club shake and go down baby 
 Its past my curfew but parole don't know 
 Tear up the club don't call my p.o. 
 (50 CENT) - shorty so seductive dancin on me 
 It's the way that she move that makin' me horny 
 If I wake up next to her in the morning 
 I'm a turn over and tell her let's do it again 
 (YAYO) - shorty so seductive dancin on me 
 The way that she move is makin' me horny 
 If I wake up next to her in the morning 
 I'm a turn over and tell her let's do it again 
 (Tony yayo verse) 
 My ways be spinnin I charm the amazing way 
 You know them black and them white and the asian women 
 Lets cut the small talk you know why I brought you 
 I can't stand when a dime act anti-social 
 Gucci, lip gloss, louis baton, and the boots from batego vanetto cost a arm 
 Yayos a don my car European 
 You got mirrors in your pants 'cause I can see me in um 
 Listen I piss out cris inhale haze 
 I'm a get married and get laid all day 
 Tattoos and piercings and rings in your tongue 
 Shorty things like that will make my black ass cum 
 I need groupie love the coupe on dubs 
 I'm in this club with a tre pound star 
 Don't blame it on david I'm all iced out 
 Cause 50 got me rich so the bar all priced out 
 (50 CENT) - shorty so seductive dancin on me 
 It's the way that she move that makin' me horny 
 If I wake up next to her in the morning 
 I'm a turn over and tell her let's do it again 
 (YAYO) - shorty so seductive dancin on me 
 The way that she move is makin' me horny 
 If I wake up next to her in the morning 
 I'm a turn over and tell her let's do it again
