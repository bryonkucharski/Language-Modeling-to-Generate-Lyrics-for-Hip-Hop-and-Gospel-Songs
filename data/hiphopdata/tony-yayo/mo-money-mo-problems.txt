Can't trust my friends, can't trust my enemies 
 Can't trust these hoes, I can't trust this industry 
 Everybody out to get me but 
 It's mo money mo problems 
 It's mo money mo problems 
 It's mo money mo problems 
 It's mo money mo problems 
 Yeah 
 The Unit ain't been the same 
 But I'm a hold this shit, down the streets screamin my name 
 I got so cool beef with you know who 
 I just bought thirty swammies to supply the crew 
 This weed got me paranoid, you feel it in the air 
 If I get too paranoid, I shoot the engineer 
 Yeah, I'm flyin in a Lear from Estonia 
 I got the sniper money I just spent a home on ya 
 When it's time to ride, there's a Hum (mer) full of niggaz 
 When it's time for a show, there's a Bent (ley) full of niggaz 
 Snake ass niggaz is reptiles 
 Till I shoot 'em up fill 'em up with projectiles 
 Stay focused, these faggots in European cars 
 Only thing European is the wood on the Rolls 
 Hudred EX with the suicide doors 
 My car give you a hug to strike a pose
