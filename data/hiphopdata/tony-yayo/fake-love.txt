 (Tony Yayo Intro) 
 Yeah... 
 Yeah... 
 Yeah... 
 Fake love's when your homie give you dap 
 Smile in your face but he wants your ass clapped 
 Fake love... 
 Fake love's when they never be around 
 But once you get rich, they all get down 
 Fake love... 
 Fake love's when your friend fuck your bitch 
 Don't think with his head only think with his dick 
 Fake love... 
 So my friends enemies and my enemies be friends 
 Don't show no love, don't pretend 
 50 got Yayo gettin' all this cash 
 Now all these Yes men wanna kiss my ass 
 But back in the street you ain't help me re-up 
 Locked up, I had court dates, you never showed up 
 What the fuck, tell me what you grinnin' at nigga 
 If I get killed, my stash, you spendin' that nigga 
 Some people want nutin' outta life 
 And some people want it all, let's ball 
 I see the jealousy and envy when you see me shoppin' 
 Saphire watch, got your jaw droppin' 
 When I move that 8th, you were 7 gram coppin' 
 You ain't happy for me, you hope that the Feds watchin' 
 I ain't stoppin', homie I'm number one 
 Why you schemin' on me, I'm plain and dumb 
 So when it comes to the point, that you ready to flip 
 I'ma pull out first, and let off my clip, Take That!

 So my friends enemies and my enemies be friends 
 Don't show no love, don't pretend 
 Now your man ain't your man if he extortin' you nigga 
 And your man ain't your man if he shortenin' you nigga 
 Listen money talks, and bullshit run marathons 
 When your money's gone, that's when them hoes gon' 
 Fake love is when a nigga sets you up 
 How he knew about your chain when your ching was tucked 
 You know the type that rats you out, sell you out 
 Get locked, your man ain't gon' bail you out 
 You got a brand new whip, your shit is lovely 
 Yeah it's aight, but its rims is ugly 
 Fake friends, show fake love 
 You know the type of nigga that'll leave you in the club 
 Fake love...
