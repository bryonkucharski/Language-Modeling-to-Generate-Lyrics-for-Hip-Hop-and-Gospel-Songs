Tony Yayo: 
 I need a gangsta bitch 
 'Cause I'm a gangsta nigga 
 (Verse 1: Tony Yayo) 
 Some days I'm happy and some I'm not 
 You was there for me baby when I was on lock 
 And them 8 hour trips really meant alot 
 You even called MCI when the phone was blocked 
 Listen ma, I ain't tryin' to be ya baby father 
 I'll be there when you need me ya knight in shining armor 
 Sippin' Malibu loungin' in the Malibu Mountains 
 Now we livin' straight no more Section 8 Housing 
 Its just me and my bitch you know like Big said 
 Take me to exctasy lovin' in the bed 
 Do you love me or love that I'm rappin'? 
 Nah she like that white gold, rose gold, pink gold and platinum 
 (Chorus: Olivia) 
 Oh I'll do anything for you 
 I'll do anything that you want me to 
 'Cause I'm your gangsta boo 
 Yeeeeesss I'll take a Greyhound trip for you 
 Carry that work across town in a day or two 
 'Cause I'm your gangsta who'll do anything for you 
 (Verse 2: Tony Yayo) 
 My uptown mami she materialistic 
 My BK shorty down to hold the biscuit 
 My Qu shorty she one of a kind 
 So if you ain't got game don't waste your time 
 My down south bitch she keep it crunk 
 And my bitch in Cali man she love them blunts 
 When it comes to sex baby the kid can last 
 I stay real real hard like the calculus glass 
 Ma my hands up your shirt girl feelin' on your panties 
 Fingers all sticky off that pink cotton candy 
 Sexin' on the beach where its hot and sandy 
 Apple martinis out in Miami 
 (Chorus: Olivia) 
 Oh I'll do anything for you 
 I'll do anything that you want me to 
 'Cause I'm your gangsta boo 
 Yeeeeesss I'll take a Greyhound trip for you 
 Carry that work across town in a day or two 
 'Cause I'm your gangsta that'll do anything for you 
 (Tony Yayo: Singing) 
 We had our share of troubles 
 Many more than others 
 With a little love and understanding 
 We can fly high than any mountain 
 Ha ha I'm just playing 
 (Verse 3: Tony Yayo) 
 What make you a good girl with Gucci on your feet 
 Livin' in the club and hangin' in the street 
 Keeki a dime she straight from uptown 
 She move like Mimi's girls in the Pussy Pound 
 And Hera 
 I met her in Lord And Taylor 
 By Clinique and Mac 
 Baby got back 
 What's up with that? 
 Don Perigon 
 The boots from Batetto Vennetto cost a arm 
 (Chorus: Olivia) 
 Oh I'll do anything for you 
 I'll do anything that you want me to 
 'Cause I'm your gangsta boo 
 Yeeeeesss I'll take a Greyhound trip for you 
 Carry that work across town in a day or two 
 'Cause I'm your gangsta who'll do anything for you 
 Olivia: 
 Gangsta boo
