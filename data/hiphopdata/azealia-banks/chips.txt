Jammed in the bill came with the deal 
 This about to be another jam on the reals 
 You can dance if you're with it put your game on stills 
 But you can't can't slip it while the dance on shills 
 Saw your man, I should meet him and your man toss chips 
 Went to France on a visa, a hundred grand for the trip 
 When I lean I could greet him with then lamb on a strip 
 Little bambs with for the visa for the game and the fit 
 Damn little diva you're the champ, you're the shit, 
 You're the glam, and the glitz, you're a vamp you're a bitch 
 Listen up my nigga, you're a fan, you a trick 
 You be amp to the spits with ya man's in the whip 
 And I heard you're rich, heard you're "rich nigga" rich 
 Heard your click, had to lick 
 Can you stick to the bricks 
 And if it splits get your cran in your tips 
 Put your hand on your dick 
 Take a gander at this 
 High you been on my mind, you been on my eyes, 
 Realize this 
 Show me, show, show me one time 
 Right, and even your right the look in your eyes 
 I like it, 
 Won't you just show me one time 
 Uh, uh, uh 
 I'm everywhere you can't go 
 I'm everywhere you wish you could 
 I'm sussed up in that Van Vogue 
 My weave long and my pussy good 
 I lift it up, and I tip it slow 
 That chocolate body that tootsie roll 
 That flirty Hershey, lawda mercy 
 Do it to me, don't hurt me, hurt me 
 Rollie polie, float your boatie 
 Dick it up it's so swolely swolely 
 Swolely swolely, he holdin' holdin' 
 He packin' pack and I'm throwing back 
 And I'm counting racks while he lick the crack 
 If he acting up then he gettin' slapped 
 If I pop the trunk, then he gettin' clapped 
 I'll pop ya rump and I'll split your back 
 High you been on my mind, you been on my eyes, 
 Realize this 
 Show me, show, show me one time 
 Right, and even your right the look in your eyes 
 I like it, 
 Won't you just show me one time 
 Uh, uh, uh 
 Can I get that 
 Can I get that whip 
 Can I take that trip 
 Can I get that grip 
 Can I split that chip where my bitch pat 
 Where my rich cat, 
 Will you keep that shit when you hit that strip 
 When you hit that scene, and the scene get a tan 
 And a six pack, where my bitch pack 
 Where'd you get them clothes 
 How you make that roll, how you make that dose 
 Sip it slow, sip it slow, sip it, sit back 
 Quit the chit chat 
 Before I rip that bow, when I rip your soul 
 When I rip that bow 
 High you been on my mind, you been on my eyes, 
 Realize this 
 Show me, show, show me one time 
 Right, and even your right the look in your eyes 
 I like it, 
 Won't you just show me one time 
 Uh, uh, uh
