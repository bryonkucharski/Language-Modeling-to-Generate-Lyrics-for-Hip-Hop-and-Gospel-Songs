Bambi, belle of the ball 
 Banji, better than them all 
 Never been a flaw 
 Pretty kitty, manicure the claws, silly 
 Never been a draw 
 When I purr, bet he wanna paw 
 Cause a stur when she on the floor 
 Given it her all 
 Champagne always on the pour 
 Some happy, others can applaud 
 Bum bitches aggy, but of course 
 Mermaid coming on the shore 
 Take the prince crown and the coin 
 Shut it down, then a bitch is gone 
 'Nother round of Dom Pérignon 
 Downtown, vampin' to the song 
 Tiara on my head when it's worn 
 Style get the critics in amor 
 Physically shawty is the bomb 
 Whether blue weave or the blonde 
 Harlem or Milan 
 Banks break the bank and the bonds 
 I used to think I was fierce 
 'Cause I was in all the houses 
 I won trophies 
 I used to munch trade for dollars, too. 
 But see, I'm fiercer now 
 'Cause I got a job, I got an education 
 And I got somebody waiting at home for me, God damn it. 
 Now, one queen ask me the other day, was it. 
 She told me: "Miss Thing, you think you're fierce?" 
 I said: "Of course." 
 She said "All queens think their fierce." 
 I said "Miss Thing, all queens and me." 
 Bon Appetit, I'm a feast for the eyes 
 The reason why I'm, in luxury design 
 So chic, so ahead the time 
 Kunt queen, princess of the prize 
 Witness the baddest bitch alive 
 I'm reporting from the belly of the night 
 Gorgeous: plus the world is mine 
 A girl with a twirl and a rhyme 
 Welcome to her house in the sky 
 The house, the house, work me the house 
 You pay ten dollar get to the ball you - 
 Work me 
 the house, 
 work me 
 the house, 
 work me 
 the house 
 Cause you pay ten dollars to get to the ball you - 
 Work me 
 the house, 
 work me 
 the house, 
 work me 
 the house 
 Cause you pay ten dollar get to the ball you - 
 Work me 
 the house, 
 work me 
 the house, 
 work me 
 the house 
 Cause you pay ten dollars to get to the ball you - 
 Work me 
 the house, 
 work me 
 the house, 
 work me 
 the house 
 Cause you pay ten dollars to get in the ball you mock? 
 The house, the house, the house, the house 
 Work me, God damn it 
 Work me, God damn it. 
 Back at it 'gain 
 My only bad habit (s), my addiction to win 
 She only mad at it, did it better than her friends 
 You only have Cheddar to attend 
 Wang gown with leather on the trim 
 Get together with the slim 
 Mermaid who came on the swim 
 Wave to the gents 
 Do my dips and the spin 
 Turn tricks for the fucking ends? 
 You turned dick for the fucking gem? 
 You a bum bitch to the end 
 Come again, come again? 
 You running to the wrong sip, rum to the gin? 
 Bambi work it out like felons in a gym 
 Hey fella, f-fella I'm better than a ten 
 Eleven in the denim 
 About twelve in her skin 
 Young mademoiselle, the devil wears Prada 
 I'm giving them hell, you bitches gettin' nada.
