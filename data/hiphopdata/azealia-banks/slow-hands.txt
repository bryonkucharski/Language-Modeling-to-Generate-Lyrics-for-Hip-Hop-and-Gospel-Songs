Yeah but nobody searches 
 Nobody cares somehow 
 When the loving that you've wasted 
 Comes raining from a hapless cloud 
 And I might stop and look upon your face 
 Disappear in the sweet, sweet gaze 
 See the living that surrounds me 
 Dissipate in a violet place 
 Can't you see what you've done to my heart 
 And soul? 
 This is a wasteland now 
 We spies 
 We slow hands 
 Put the weights all around yourself 
 We spies 
 Oh yeah we slow hands 
 You put the weights all around yourself now 
 I submit my incentive is romance 
 I watched the pole dance of the stars 
 We rejoice because the hurting is so painless 
 >From the distance of passing cars 
 But I am married to your charms & grace 
 I just go crazy like the good old days 
 You make me want to pick up a guitar 
 And celebrate the myriad ways that I love you 
 Can you see what you've done to my heart 
 And soul? 
 This is a wasteland now 
 We spies 
 Yeah we slow hands 
 You put the weights all around yourself 
 We spies 
 Oh yeah we slow hands 
 Killer, for hire you know not yourself 
 We spies 
 We slow hands 
 You put the weights all around yourself 
 We spies 
 Oh yeah we slow hands 
 We retire like nobody else
