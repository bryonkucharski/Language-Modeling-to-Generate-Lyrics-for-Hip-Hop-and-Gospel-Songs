 Black women's attraction 
 All the white girls join in the action 
 Do you jingle when you dingle-dangle? 
 Everybody does the bingle-bangle, Ow 
 Nude Beach a Go-Go 
 Nude Beach a Go-Go 
 Don't ya don't ya know-know? 
 Sun tan in the snow-snow 
 Everybody goes where the roses bloom 
 Come and enjoy the living rooms 
 By the lifeguard station by the coral reef 
 Hallelujah, Heaven, Hell and all in between 
 There's no clothes to wear 
 And there's summer in her hair 
 And chiffon and silk and wool and cotton 
 They all are forgotten
