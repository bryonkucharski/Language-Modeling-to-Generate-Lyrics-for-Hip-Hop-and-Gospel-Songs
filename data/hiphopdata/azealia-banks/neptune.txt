 Damn should've have shacked breeze with the champion 
 Looking for my nigga my feast is the phantom 
 Phantom this is that young bitch Lil Keke

 Chill with some fillers from end the shikies

 Hey what's your sign, tell me what else is you into?

 Take it off your wishlist, can you feel-feel this 
 I'm the type of girl yo mama warned ya about 
 Stop fucking with your head, blow your brains all out 
 Tell me what you like, me a real bad gyal 
 Give it to you good, make your head turn mad now 
 Not vanilla we're cinnamon sticks they'll be killing bitches 
 I'm on my liquorice shit till the niggas diggie it stiff 
 Like Agamartis, riga-rigamortis tipi tipi on his lips 
 We could take flights to the West Indes 
 Check her dipping out the sea with a mermaid please 
 Sip of liquor, bit of rum right under the trees 
 Tell this London girl, what's your fantaseas, boy?
