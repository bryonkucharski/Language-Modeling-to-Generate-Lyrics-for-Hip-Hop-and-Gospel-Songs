I tried to hide behind tired eyes, I sigh 
 I'm tired of trying to try not to cry and 
 I say soda, soda 
 Tye dye O'er

 I coast, I dose, I 
 A smile a guise 
 I'm trying to hide behind tired eyes, I sigh 
 I might survive the nighttime, I might die 
 I say soda soda, I'm a high roller 
 Yo sir I pose for the poster- Yep 
 Icy Cola Coca, Sprite I love the most-a 
 I ride rollercoasters! I try all the cultures 
 A smile, a guise 
 Nighttime, is mine to lie eyes awide and I 
 I'm tired of trying to try not to cry and 
 I say soda!... 
 I'm lota, yo sir 
 I ride roller- 
 I try all the cultures 
 Light my swollen smoker 
 I might comatosa

 Been thinking 'bout the way you'll leave me right, here
