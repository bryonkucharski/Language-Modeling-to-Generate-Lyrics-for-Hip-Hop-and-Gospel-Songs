(Damn nigga damn, took a chance on ya, double and dipped again) 
 GO! 
 You could do your dance 
 Take a chance with your lover like this began! 
 Sing 
 I want somebody who can take it apart 
 Stitch me back together make me into who I wanna be 
 But all you ever do is sit in the dark 
 Dealing with the Devil, you ain't never ever gonna be mine 
 'Cause I'm born to dance in the moonlight 
 I feel like spending my nights alone 
 I try to give you a little more space to grow 
 White lies, I don't wanna be around anymore 
 I'm through giving, I've got to go... 
 Am I chasing time? 
 'Cause I wasted all mine on you (you) 
 Am I chasing time? (time) 
 'Cause I wasted all mine on you (you) 
 Check my watch, I had the future in my pocket 
 But I lost it when I gave it to you (you) 
 If tomorrow drops, I had my time right in my locket 
 But I lost it when I gave it to you (you) 
 Damn, nigga, damn 
 Took a chance on you, double and dipped again 
 And, scram, nigga, scram 
 Hit your man's up and tell 'em to get the van 
 And reminiscing can't 
 Bring it back to the cabin in Michigan 
 But man, this the plan 
 Say goodbye to your lover cause this the end 
 'Cause I'm born to dance in the moonlight 
 I feel like spending my nights alone 
 I try to give you a little more space to grow 
 White lies, I don't wanna be around anymore 
 I'm through giving, I've got to go... 
 Am I chasing time? 
 'Cause I wasted all mine on you (you) 
 Am I chasing time? (time) 
 'Cause I wasted all mine on you (you) 
 Check my watch, I had the future in my pocket 
 But I lost it when I gave it to you (you) 
 If tomorrow drops, I had my time right in my locket 
 But I lost it when I gave it to you (you) 
 Yo, get lost hit the highway, freeway 
 We've been off-course like the wrong-way relay 
 Need me a boss, you're a constant delay 
 These the kinda thoughts I've been having for three days... 
 Feel like you're more of a homie 
 Please, you don't even know me 
 You think I'm starting new relations 
 I'm just departing and need my space and 
 Time to myself, ventilation 
 No time for you, I lack the patience 
 And you're like, "Girl, how you do that?" 
 My attitude is bitchy but you already knew that... 
 And since we can't get along 
 I think we should both move on 
 (GO!) 
 'Cause I'm born to dance in the moonlight 
 I feel like spending my nights alone 
 I try to give you a little more space to grow 
 White lies, I don't wanna be around anymore 
 I'm through giving, I've got to go... 
 Am I chasing time? 
 'Cause I wasted all mine on you (you) 
 Am I chasing time? (time) 
 'Cause I wasted all mine on you (you) 
 Check my watch, I had the future in my pocket 
 But I lost it when I gave it to you (you) 
 If tomorrow drops, I had my time right in my locket 
 But I lost it when I gave it to you (you)
