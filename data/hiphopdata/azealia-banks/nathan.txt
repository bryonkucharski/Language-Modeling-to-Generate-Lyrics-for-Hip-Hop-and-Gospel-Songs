Azealia Banks: 
 What up, what up? 
 Do you motherfuckers 
 Wanna gamble with your luck? 
 Better roll four, five, six 
 Then up and up 
 I'm a roll head, crack trips 
 You got the nuts? 
 I'm a call your bluff like 
 "I'm next, small talk" 
 Never turn the big bucks 
 Fine man, fuck got they 
 Hand and with a fucking fine man 
 Smoke a lotta ciga 
 Do a nigga have to bust this nigga? 
 I don't wanna slump this nigga 
 I don't wanna dump this nigga 
 I don't wanna lunch this nigga 
 I don't wanna hit your little goon 
 In the chest and the stomach 
 Douche gut this nigga 
 You don't really want this nigga 
 Y'all niggas, stay hating 
 Y'all niggas ain't getting Nathan 
 Y'all niggas don't want no drama 
 (Y'all niggas don't want no problems) 
 Y'all niggas, y'all niggas, y'all niggas 
 Y'all niggas, y'all niggas, y'all niggas 
 Y'all niggas, none of y'all want it 
 Y'all niggas ain't getting Nathan 
 Y'all niggas, stay hating 
 Y'all niggas ain't getting Nathan 
 Y'all niggas don't want no drama 
 (Y'all niggas don't want no problems) 
 Y'all niggas, y'all niggas, y'all niggas 
 Y'all niggas, none of y'all want it 
 Stay talking that shit, y'all hating 
 (Y'all niggas ain't getting Nathan) 
 Styles P: 
 Y'all niggas ain't getting Nathan 
 Fuck is y'all anticipating? 
 That will make me just lose my patience 
 Grab a gun and just strip you naked 
 No KONY, no island 
 Phony nigga, you was never wildin' 
 Warrior nigga, I'm forever styling 
 No trying, four five 'em 
 We looking for 'em, I'm lying 
 Two guns up, I'm riding 
 You ain't looking for me, I ain't hiding 
 Ain't the park nigga, no sliding 
 You could see saw, see a sawed-off or C4 
 "Bom Pow! " 
 Nigga Batman words 
 "Where the juice? " 
 Nigga gat man words 
 "Where's the bread? " 
 Nigga fat man words 
 "Where's the block? " 
 Nigga crack man words 
 Ya niggas, ya niggas 
 Can't fuck with my niggas 
 That's my word 
 Yeah it's Ghost 
 And Azealia Banks 
 Go head nigga 
 You can feel that shank 
 Go head nigga 
 Just light your dank 
 Mind your business 
 And drink your drink 
 Yeah!

 Ketchup 
 I'm hot, dog 
 Frankfurters, you're Nathan 
 But relish hatin' 
 Trust me, I pop off 
 Ain't one of y'all 
 None of y'all gonna make it 
 Spread you like Mustard 
 Don't trust em' 
 Burn em', boil em' 
 Grill em', bake em' 
 Nada, no problem 
 Zero, zilch em', vacant 
 It's nothing- Nathan 
 Back to the basics, poppin' Aces 
 Poker face, I'll pop your face in 
 You already know I got this blazin' 
 Back up with that cocky statement 
 Don't make me have to cock my favorite 
 How you want it, roof or basement? 
 Birds Eye view or bottom lake it 
 How bout gon strip to make it? 
 Stripped 'em naked, stripped the bacon 
 Left this muthafucka with his pistol shaking 
 Racy like eight Jamaicans 
 Bust your nigga grape and 
 I scraped his raisin 
 Kept my cool and I held my patience 
 I bet your boy becomes a trauma patient 
 I bet your boy ease up the combination 
 If you ain't talking money 
 Skip the conversation 
 Y'all niggas, stay hating 
 Y'all niggas ain't getting Nathan 
 Y'all niggas don't want no drama 
 (Y'all niggas don't want no problems) 
 Y'all niggas, y'all niggas, y'all niggas 
 Y'all niggas, none of y'all want it 
 Stay talking that shit, y'all hating 
 Y'all niggas ain't getting Nathan 
 Y'all niggas, stay hating 
 Y'all niggas ain't getting Nathan 
 Y'all niggas don't want no drama 
 (Y'all niggas don't want no problems)

 Y'all niggas, none of y'all want it 
 Stay talking that shit, y'all hating 
 Y'all niggas ain't getting Nathan
