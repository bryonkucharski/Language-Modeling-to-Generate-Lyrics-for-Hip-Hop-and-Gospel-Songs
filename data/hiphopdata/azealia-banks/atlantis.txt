Hi, hi, all right, hey, all right 
 Why you've been running your mouth 
 All out, and wipe for it's just island 
 Right to mention you, and I heard why a word 
 But I was in New York, New York, New York 
 I, I, I know you might like do you feel her world 
 But you just ride away in desire 
 Tryina say hello, some of you mean hello 
 It's all right, let's do, let's do 
 You know I spit slick game, slick game, to the brothers 
 When I hip hop slang bang bang for the summer 
 I'm the sweet sweet thing they say you the summer 
 So they nick nick name named me the mother 
 Of hip hop, pray, pray for your butter 
 You in tip top shake, shake nigga running 
 To the escape, straight, straight to the cover 
 Little wish pop, Jupiter queen 
 Your bitch make hits never do it for free 
 I can't take that risk, never 2 out of 3 
 And took the blue out the scene 
 The blue in the wave 
 And hit the bam bams niggas then it blue in the raise 
 Word to you and the man get the blow in the cheese 
 If you a big shot nigga I am see you believe 
 And spit the shit on the labour 
 Hit yourself with the name 
 You little witch pop nigga, nigga who could it be? 
 (Verse: repeat)
