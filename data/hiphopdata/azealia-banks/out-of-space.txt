I take your brain to another dimension 
 I take your brain in a parallel universe trip 
 I'm the only no parallel bitch 
 Things running and shit, maneuvered in deep 
 Then I murder you and you spit 
 Get your little outdated frozen a hip 
 On the word click click 
 How much is for this clip 
 Blast it off last 'er, you might be stuck on this dick 
 Look at this bitch, tick tick 
 What you do, wanna get hit hit 
 Four fifth move quick, four fifth's in the whip 
 What dimension is this 
 I'm gonna send him to outer space, to find another race 
 I'm gonna send him to outer space, to find another race 
 I'm gonna send him to outer space, to find another race 
 I'm gonna send him to outer space, to find another race 
 Pay close attention 
 I take your brain to another dimension

 Get your little outdated frozen a hip 
 On the word click click 
 Close attention 
 Yo what's up Neutron 
 Giving you money what planet you flew from 
 I've been pressing the hard rock 
 Promise group on 
 Cosmos kitchens, known as the New York 
 Out of world witch, breakers and new borns 
 Space ships push the roof on 
 Platform boots hanging out the coop door 
 Out of the world bitch, chicks a new born 
 Every little pun errupt a new song 
 I'm ahead of your shaky shoe show 
 ET phone room full of photon 
 Ever since, no need for the blues off 
 Keep on, the feening, the feen off 
 The fews go finally speed off 
 Here to take you higher than leeloo 
 Bounce off, casanova libra 
 Pay close attention 
 Pay close attention 
 Pay close attention 
 Pay close attention
