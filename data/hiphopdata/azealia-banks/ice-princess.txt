Azealia Banks: 
 I'm so cold I'm dripping icicles 
 I go and take your man that nigga Might miss you 
 Spent his whole commission on my neck and ear 
 To stand around me need to have ya winter gear 
 Pay me coats 'n' benz's and that berg-ice 
 That's why I do not feel these bitches, Frostbite 
 Grown money, ever since a youngin' made my own money 
 You broke honey, and they call me Banks, 'cause I can loan money 
 Colder than December, my diamonds on Anna Wintour 
 So that's fly ice in my life 
 I don't see no limits so I strive and I shine twice 
 I ride around and get it, just listen for a minute 
 That was only one thought let me finish... 
 Competition I'mma beat 'em so relentless 
 I'ma be legendary when I end this 
 They rise when I arrive in this 
 "All Hail The Supreme Ice Princess!" 
 Tell the carriage, hurry up and come and get me 
 Tell the haters run along you can miss me 
 Hollywood you can go and A-list me... 
 I like a shot of hard whiskey... 
 Angela McCluskey and Azealia Banks: 
 Feelin' it, I'm feeling a change 
 I'm feeling it, in the air 
 I'm feelin' it, I'm feeling a change 
 I'm feeling it, in the air 
 So let me in! 
 Azealia Banks: 
 Her motives is frozen 
 Giving chill pill to them polars 
 Corrosive, the coldest, city is a tundra 
 Stay focused, no wonder, - Frigid princess come from 
 Cold cash and them ice chunks, Stone frost in my Celine pumps 
 Rolls-Royce, snow white-ups 
 Colder than December, diamonds on Anna Wintour 
 These glaciers glamour and glisten 
 Antarctic, it's like a blizzard, my jargon (is) 
 "Fuck you I'm frigid" 
 Cool it down or get avalanched 
 Igloo'd cold-cased and bodied 
 And ice-cubed up in the lobby 
 Bitch, white fox, peep the opulence... 
 Ice box the coolest confidence 
 Isis-Queen, the Icy-Witch 
 Winterfresh in that whitey-Benz 
 Shimmering Aphrodite 
 Winter-wonderland body so frosty in that Bugatti 
 Porcelain-Snowflakin' Papi, popsicle in ya pocket... 
 I'm polarizing ya profits 
 I freeze 'em, flip 'em, and rock it 
 Cocoa a-la mode, who's frozen from head to toe 
 Ice-grillin' the status quo 
 Cold-killer so now you know 
 Angela McCluskey and Azealia Banks: 
 Feelin' it, I'm feeling a change 
 I'm feeling it, in the air 
 I'm feelin' it, I'm feeling a change 
 I'm feeling it, in the air 
 So let me in!
