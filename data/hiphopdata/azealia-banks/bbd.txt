Uh 
 Let me get that 
 Let me get that ooh 
 I get it when I get that ooh 
 I spend it when I whip that 
 Flossin' on them haters 
 It's that boss - the bitch, that caker 
 Tricks that's born to tip that shaker 
 He's forfeiting all that paper 
 Niggas coughing off that 8th of- 
 I wanna hit them vapors 
 It's that sporty bitch that game 'em 
 They calling me Super Sega - hit that! 
 I'm just really out here livin' 
 Something like the new edition 
 They say I'm poison what's the difference?
