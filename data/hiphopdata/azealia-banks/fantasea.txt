Close to the moon [x3] 
 Oh so close to the moon 
 Close to the moon [x2] 
 I wanna take you so close 
 A passion for life fantastic 
 Less they gonna go basket, next to go 
 I'm a hug against the good life, X n' O 
 Hey, feel better than X n' Blow 
 Get high from a line turn text to notes 
 See these niggas gased up like Texaco 
 Watch your bitch pulling Pepsi Co 
 Ever since it was a NBO 
 Had magic glow, young dynamo 
 Young fool, young killa' with the finer flow 
 Young rapping doe, never will, never half a ho 
 Give me celebrate and have a toast 
 Young sister pretends to though 
 Boy me and you, oh 
 So close to the moon 
 If it's okay-ay for you 
 Close to the moon 
 And I wannna take you so close 
 Tryina say I'm here for the fantasea 
 Trust me, your fantasea 
 Trust me, your fantasea 
 Take you close 
 Fast forward live half your life 
 No wrong cause the cash was right 
 Have a bitch bling twice like a hazard light 
 More than weekly pass the fights 
 Non believers on astronome 
 Burning people like Fahrenheit 
 Run the world like Satellite 
 Baby girl got, baby girl got options 
 Right DJ to the beat, H pass the light 
 Far from the passive type 
 I excite your life and ass it 
 Better than your average 
 That is captain of the ship baby just imagine 
 Everything you want, you can have it 
 Trip, trip, trip, you on a magic 
 Do you really, really want the Ask us? 
 Growing with the Phoenix from the ashes 
 Corn with the Cash n' 
 No Quarter, No Ration 
 Numbers on the masses, runners of the nashin' 
 Anything you want is established 
 Anything you want you can have it 
 (Music Interlude) 
 So close to the moon 
 If It's okay for you 
 Oh so close to the moon 
 Oh so close to the moon 
 And I wanna take you so close 
 Spoken Section: 
 Life is a series of choices 
 What you eat, how You Look 
 Whether you do drugs or not 
 See only you can decide because the only person responsible is you 
 And if you make the right choice, there's nothing you can't accomplish 
 If you make the wrong choice, all your decisions will be made for you
