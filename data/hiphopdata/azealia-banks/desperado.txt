Peter Rosenberg: 
 Yeah, you know what it is, it's Hot 97 
 My name is Peter Rosenberg, and, uh 
 We're gonna get to some new music right now 
 This is a record called "Desperado" 
 Okay, by my girl, Azealia Banks 
 Man, I've been waiting for Azealia Banks 
 Waiting for Azealia Banks 
 Waiting for Azealia Banks 
 (Desperado) 
 Azealia Banks: 
 Up's and up, seductive pup 
 Flux - did a dip, pack up then strut 
 Up's nigga, w-what's up nigga? 
 With that buck, can I get that rrr-rompin' uh 
 Mutts in tux, deluxe and such 
 I be in the mirror lookin' Luxe N Plush 
 Looks and such, seductive strut 
 I be Aquafizzy or that Passion Punch 
 Or the Fashions Munch, but the fabric's lush 
 You don't get the access none 
 Spun him on my axis - Sun 
 Hit him with the hazard, hun 
 Denim and a satin rump 
 Blend it with the carrot blush 
 Plus I got the cash and the bass have ya spazzin' some 
 Come get ya limps in bum 
 Dinner with the princess one 
 Printed in expensive funds 
 MJ Cole: 
 Hey, yo 
 That's how I do my thing 
 Desperado 
 Hey, yo 
 That's how I do my thing 
 Desperado 
 Azealia Banks: 
 I be pretty, prissy, plenty plush and stuff 
 You be piggy-pissy, penny-crushed and crunched 
 Crust and dust, slumped and jumped 
 Queen scissor-cut suit, other's not trump 
 Giddy up, this buck - titty tuck, no such 
 I be freaky frizzy in the front and up 
 You be very sleazy lady-lump hip-strut 
 Betty-bump this bun, parrrump-pun-dun 
 MJ Cole:

 Azealia Banks: 
 Hit 'em with that acid tongue 
 Venom in that Python Pump 
 Bet he hunt this hun 
 Here the huntress come 
 Get amongst this one 
 If the freaky function fun 
 I could be the perfect one 
 Splurgin' on the purchase, yum 
 Mergin' on the purpose, won 
 When the verse is spun, I'ma hertz this 
 Can't-can't rehearse this, none 
 This is 147th street 
 Next is 157th 
 Desperado!
