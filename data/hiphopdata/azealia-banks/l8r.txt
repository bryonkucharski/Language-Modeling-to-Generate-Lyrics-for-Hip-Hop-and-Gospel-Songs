Yo, you rocking with with the man crook 
 You can get your man took quicker than your hand shook 
 No frontin', it's about his paper 
 He a giver, I'm a taker and a fibber and a faker 
 You gotta spend a lot for this behavior 
 If it ain't about a dollar, I'm a holler at you later 
 Yeah, you already know 
 I get the dough and it's never slow (and it's never slow) 
 Never know, and if you don't, it's whatever, yo 
 (Pay, pay, pay) 
 Gotta get it, gotta get, I gotta get it 
 You gotta spend a lot for this behavior 
 If it ain't about a dollar, I'm a holler at you later 
 Light skin world, light skin girls 
 Switching his vanilla 'cause he likes that swirl, yeah 
 He like black girls and he love a musician 
 And fucking with this older nigga, he a fucking magician, son 
 He tricking off, cause my verse perverse 
 And jerking off when a bitch rehearse him 
 When I lift the skirt, your nigga never gotta be coerced 
 Just squirt and he eats the dessert and that's some real shit 
 I mean real tits, nice ass, tight twat 
 Dome fucking up a nigga home, call a bitch S.W.A.T 
 I get it tighter than a gridlock 
 Open your face and let a bitch squat 
 I tell him you should let his bitch watch 
 'Cause she wanna piss, nah 
 I tell her she could lick this box 
 'Cause I ain't really with that dick-swap 
 Even if you switch socks 
 Bitch is fishier than Chip Shop 
 And he was praying that her shit pop 
 Every time I say deeper, I get it warmer than a space heater 
 No ordinary taste either, this that candy 
 He was tryin' lick it off to see through my panties 
 I was tryin' kick it, but he was like can he- 
 Eat a little dinner, want to sit with my family 
 Nah, there's probably not a lot in this container 
 If it ain't about a dollar, I'm a holler at you later (ha!)
