Sometimes I wanna get away from all the confusion 
 Causin' pollution 
 I know you wish you could run away from this institution 
 Cause there's no solution, to survive 
 Another day when I'm waking up 
 I turn my TV on CNN 
 Another homie done bit the dust, my best friend's back up in the pen 
 Somebody hit the twin towers, ? and the buildings came tumbling down 
 All we could do was watch in tears 
 While the people of America wondered how we let it go down 
 Then, I heard a sound when I turned around 
 This old man said pray for me 
 Said I've been in the world for 88 long years and go now can you stay for me? 
 I looked him in the eyes, and gave him a smile and said mister I don't mean no harm 
 But you ain't going nowhere, so just pull up a chair 
 I got greens fresh off the farm 
 And with that he pulled a bottle from his pocket and said youngin' ima give it a try 
 I said hold up pops, I ain't forget about the knowledge you promised so pass it by 
 And then he said... 
 From dusk to dawn, mom's always tellin' me you must move on 
 Let the past be the last thing to dust you son 
 And I trust you mom 
 But the ? lust for fun, wanna bust my gun 
 Wasn't much to some, then you measured up to most started walking down the road 
 To the treasure up the post 
 You just never f***ing know what you gonna see, where ya gonna be, who you gonna meet 
 It's true you gonna sleepin', slip into silence 
 Shot guns fired, choppers and sirens 
 Spotlight shinin, flashin on the glance 
 At a boy without a chance and the Devil on his ass 
 I be sayin' though, livin' my life... wishin' and hopin 
 I be sayin' though, chasin the dreams... 
 I be sayin' though same thing that will make you laugh will make you cry 
 That's how we know man, why that's why 
 I be sayin' though taken away from the frustration 
 I be sayin' though teach me to use my imagination 
 I be sayin' though same thing that will make you laugh will make you cry 
 That's how we know man, why that's why
