Say I ain't got time 
 (Akon) 
 Got no time to stop and speak to friends passin' by 
 (Said ain't got time) Got no time to stop and speak to friends passin' by 
 (Man ain't got time) Got no time to stop and speak to friends passin' by 
 (Pass me by) Got no time to stop and speak to friends passin' by 
 ( 
 Cause I gotta' be on my way) On my way 
 (Ain't got time to play) Time to play 
 (I can't go broke another day) Broke another day 
 (No way Jose) No way Jose ( 
 cause I ain't got no time) 
 (Bash) 
 My lifestyle so cold, holla' for the gold 
 Some say I'm too drunk, some say I'm too blowed 
 And rollin' wit' kilos and stackin' them C-Notes 
 Watchin' my cheese grow and blowin' on trees dawg 
 And I really can't help it I'm a gifted at timin' gorilla grindin' no time for groupies or freestylin' 
 Want it green as a gecko I'm respectful to some of y'all 
 But some of y'all be frontin' I don't owe shit to none of y'all 
 I got bills to comprehend, popo's be poppin' in 
 Waitin' and watchin' when, they can take my block in 
 Comin' in in all the traffic supplyin' they bad habits 
 The game is gettin' graphic but man I got to have it 
 Some love a drug addict 
 But it ain't no excuse 
 I got these money mackin' skills I'mma put 'em to use 
 And I ain't doin' too much, y'all just ain't doin' enough 
 And I refuse to let a so-called ruin my stuff

 I'm movin', and got nothin' to say 
 Cause 24 hours ain't enough time in a day 
 So time doesn't exist and I'm watchin' my wrist 
 If a peck on the cheek mean death watch for the kiss 
 Take time under pressure 
 By any means or measure 
 Remember one's trash is another man's treasure 
 Buisness befo' pleasure I'm disciplined and I'm focused 
 Why you rap cats battle to see who dopest 
 I'm in the trenches face down in the game bruh 
 And can't nobody know my real name bruh 
 Livin' in the season they killin' fo' no reason 
 And if I make it past 30 then I'm over achievin' 
 Believin' in the truth, believin' in the way 
 The light that I follow might bring me a brighter day 
 In the truth, in the way 
 The light that I follow might bring me a brighter day
