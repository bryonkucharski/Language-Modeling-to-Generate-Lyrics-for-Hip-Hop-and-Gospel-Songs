Paul Wall, Baby Bash, what dey talkin' bout (I'm jus sayin') 
 Its throwed off playa, it's throwed off playa its throwed off play (its goin' down) 
 Its throwed off playa (already) 
 Its throwed off playa (already) 
 Its throwed off playa (already, u already know) 
 Its throwed off playa (already) 
 Its throwed off playa (already) 
 Its throwed off playa (already, know ev'rywhere we go) 
 Now its about dat time, we rearrange ur mind 
 We jammin jersey 4 shersey we blowin' on dat pine 
 Dey call me baby bash 
 So wet wen I park I splash 
 I only fuck wit da trill dat ain't no sucka task 
 Now lets accelerate 'n' get 2 celebratin' 
 I'll throw my drink in ur face wit all dat playahation 
 I'm not gon have it 
 Super unleaded watch me pimp 
 We got 'em thrown hard down at da rocky pimp 
 I gotta supa bed 
 We keep it on da cool 
 Space city, h-town man wat it do? 
 Let's get it gravitatin 
 Get thrown out da club 
 I'm throwed off like a muthafucka poppin' bub 
 Now you jus tuned into da crunk show 
 Nephews 'n' my uncles 
 We poppin' purk put in work 
 So wats up tho? 
 We like it big 'n' heavy 
 Enormous an humongous 
 An on my fingers an the glock it grew some green fungus 
 I'm tryin' na bump a beat 
 Wit out even tryin' 
 I'm throwed off like a fastball from 
 Nolan Ryan 
 Sum like 2 get it hypie 
 Sum like 2 get it crunk 
 Sum like dat bold fast 
 And sum like dat perky stuff 
 (Verse 3 paul wall) 
 I'm da Chick Magnet 
 Imma da people's champ 
 I'm in da club throwed off 'cause I'm da peoples tramp 
 I'm takin' shots of Patron 
 I wash it down wit a beer 
 I spit da same mackin game to ev'ry dime piece here 
 I'm da topic of discussion to da gurls at da bar 
 Dey wonder if I'm drinkin' alcohol 
 Or sippin on barre 
 Dey fell in love wit my car 
 Dey wanna marry my cash 
 Dey wanna be down wit a playa 
 'Cause I'm ridin' wit bash 
 I already 
 I pull up on pirelli drippin candy paint 'n' jelly 
 I stop, at *chimmy chan's* an throw sumthing in my belly 
 Its paul wall, a G in da mack 
 Its goin' down, 'cause I'm dope like dat 
 I'm jus sayin' tho
