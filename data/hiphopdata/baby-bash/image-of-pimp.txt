(Yeah, yeah, uh) 
 Its such a filthy game, 
 Its such a dirty game, 
 Da game don't eva change, 
 My image is everythang. 
 (Chorus translated in English) 
 You know my image as a pimp, it can be kind of hard to ignore, 
 Because of my image, I might call you a hore 
 You know my image as a pimp, it can be hard to accept, 
 You gotta be open for some disresepect 
 (Baby bash) 
 Word around town is I pop these P's, 
 Word around town is I hold these G's, 
 Word around town is I blow these trees, 
 Word around town is Baby Beesh, 
 Pimpin' in high velocity, y'all squares betta back up off me, 
 'Cause we gonna do what the hell we do, 
 Baby Bash the ghetto socrities, 
 Gettin' all these keys at playa prices, 
 Top notch ho by da name of Icess, 
 Soak it up qick 'cause da game is priceless, 
 Money and mackin' is nuttin nice (bitch), 
 I'm out in Ohio man I missed my trial, 
 Feds after me 'cause I serve this D, 
 Got blessed as Golden child 
 (Oral Bee translated in English) 
 I dominate the ladies, insult the ladies 
 Some think that Oral Bee is badgering the ladies 
 I massage some ladies'but keep it on the hush, 
 I'm a pimp, shit, I'm not supposed to have no crush 
 Met this lady, she was off tha hook, 
 A playa got hard off her sexy look, 
 To my homies I said that she was crazy horny, 
 And, like most *****es she was dumb and corny 
 ...Well, the truth is that this girl was mad intelligent, 
 I wanted to follow her ass everywhere it went, 
 Yeah suh! This mama turned me on, 
 But then she met some slick-talkin' playa and was gone, 
 He was a nasty playa who called her a queen, 
 Now, I can't do that, I am a pimp-machine, 
 ...Sometimes I wish that pretty ***** still was mine, 
 But, I got the image of a pimp, and I stay true to it all the time' 
 (Third verse) 
 Image of a pimp is wut I got, 
 Take a look at me girl I live it hard, 
 I ain't chose to rhyme my game is cold, 
 Million dollar mouth piece have you bringin' doe, 
 Back to da daddy in a candy caddy, 
 Wit a half bag of afghanastani, 
 'Cause me and Beesh see we blowin' big, 
 Can't help us now 'cause we on it, 
 Oh look we slammin' da bom on it, 
 Don't act like yo @ss ain't noticed it, 
 I'm rollin' wit a bunch of hoggs, 
 Y'all ready know they like to ball, 
 I get paid fo sex give me the money on a daily basis, 
 Have yo @ss on the track till 8 in da morning, 
 I'm a mack baby I ain't savin' h0s. 
 (Baby Bash) 
 Blow one... 
 Now wut it do, wut it do, is yo smokin' nephew 
 Wut it do, wut it do, is yo smokin' nephew 
 Wut it do, wut it do, is yo smokin' nephew
