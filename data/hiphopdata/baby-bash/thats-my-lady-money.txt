Money Money Money 
 (Nate Dogg) 
 That's my lady, she will never jack me down (Money, money, money) 
 That's my baby, she's gone always be around (Money, money, money) 
 She will never play me, she stray true when I leave town (Money, money, money) 
 That's my playmate 
 Got my mind on my money 
 Got my money on my mind 
 (Baby Bash) 
 She's my peso, my denero, my paper, my playmate 
 She's always on time and never a day late 
 She's never on a diet, my pockets they gain weight 
 And me without her is something I can't take 
 Now we gone ride like the wind, my lover, my dividends 
 She my fatty, I'm her dirty and she's my best friend 
 Got me spending weekends in Kingston Jamaica 
 Eww my favorite charge 
 Eww I love my paper 
 And when she step out of line, that he gone get on the grind 
 Facing penitentiary time, but she's eventually mine 
 The same color as my hydro, I swear the only breezy I die for 
 My mind sold 
 In love with this cheddar 
 Me and her go together 
 Like birds of one feather 
 She keep me riding on leather 
 And chrome, you know it's on when my baby come home 
 She's my playboy bunny that's sweeter than honeycomb

 Got my mind on my money

 Love at first sight 
 Sex on the first night 
 My blessing when I'm stressing, she's keeping my game tight 
 She's doing the thing right 
 She's beeping compliancy 
 If I'm Ricky Ricardo, then she's my Lucy 
 My fly serenity, my pockets is energy 
 As a matter of fact, she's gone bring the Hennessy 
 I'd love to hold her, fold her, her love is so douja 
 Got them dime pieces making love to my poster 
 (What is it?) 
 I'm loving this part of the game 
 And my money ain't genocide I ain't got to explain 
 Swinging her from lane to lane 
 We doing the damn thing 
 My money, my motivation, my national campaign

 That's my playmate 
 Got my mind on my money 
 Got my money on my mind 
 (Feminine Voice and Baby Bash) 
 My pride, my joy, my everything (that's what I am talking about) 
 I ride my boy on everything 
 My pride, my joy, my everything (that's what I am talking about) 
 I ride my boy on everything 
 My pride, my joy, my everything (that's what I am talking about) 
 I ride my boy on everything
