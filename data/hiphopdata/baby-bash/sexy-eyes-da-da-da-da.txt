Sexy Eyes, they're so lovely, 
 Sexy Eyes Make me wanna love ya 
 Sexy Eyes,

 Da da da da da, 
 Ya know I got the cognac, 
 Da da da da da, 
 And the phat bomb sack 
 Da da da da da, 
 Your sexy eyes got me hypnotized, 
 Lady come and take a ride with me 
 Shorty do you know the time 
 All I wanna do is vibe 
 Put you on the suga rise 
 Smilin' wit your pearly whites 
 Sexy eyes 
 Sexy waist 
 Sexy each and every day 
 When I put this thang up on ya 
 Sexy mama wanna marry me 
 But hold up now, we just met 
 Let me see how long you keep it wet 
 Hold it steady, already, 
 Baby girl we done did dat 
 It's like a stairway to paradise 
 When I look into your eyes, 
 Mama very nice 
 And we can do all type of thangs 
 Rollin' in them whips and I like to swang 
 You know it's nathan to a trildo 
 Your sexy eyes are so spiritual 
 The steelos so kamikaze 
 Shrinin' like Liberachi 
 Smellin' like Burberry 
 Me Issey Miyaki 
 It's goin' down like gravity 
 Yo baby daddy mad at me 
 And I throw these things so handley 
 Cop me an assault and battery 
 She still wanna love me like a playboy bunny 
 Lookin' like warm hunny 
 So classy and stunning 
 Faithfully, she waits for me 
 Like the real ones really do 
 So gracefully she's made for me 
 And you know that's on the cool 
 Girl get your shine on like candle in the wind 
 Gotta keep my mind strong 
 When I'm hammerin' the fin 
 And one look is all it took 
 Incredible thighs 
 And one look is all it took 
 Incredible eyes 
 (x2) 
 Time don't wait for love 
 And life don't wait for a break in the weather 
 It's time for me and you to hook up 
 Let's get this thing together
