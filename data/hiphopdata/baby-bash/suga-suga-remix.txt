(Chorus: Major Riley) 
 You got me lifted, shifted higha than da ceilin' 
 And ooh wee it is the ultimate feelin' 
 You got me lifted feeling so splifted suga how you get so fly 
 Suga suga how you get so fly (ayo) 
 Suga suga how you get so fly 
 Suga suga how you get so fly (ayo) 
 Suga suga how you get so fly 
 (Verse 1: Baby Bash (fast):) 
 You know it's leather when we ride 
 Wood grain and raw hide 
 Doin' what we do watchin' screens gettin' high 
 Girl you keep it so fly witcha sweet hunny buns 
 You was there when the money gone 
 You'll be there when the money comes 
 Off top I can't lie, I love to get blowed 
 You my lil' suga, I'm ya lil' chulo 
 And every time we kick it, it's off to the groovy 
 Treat cha' like my stickey ickey or my sweet oowey gooey (fa real though) 
 (Chorus: Major Riley) 
 (Verse 2: Baby Bash (fast):) 
 Now I ain't worried 'bout a thing 'cause I just hit me a lick 
 I gotta fat sack and a supafly chick 
 And (uh) if that ain't good than you can say we playaz 
 'Cause doowop she fly like there's a plane in the air (dat's right) 
 She full grown and settin' the wrong tone 
 I'm diggin' the energy and lovin' da o-zone 
 So fly like a dove, so fly like a raven 
 Quick to politic wit' some fly conversation 
 In a natural mood, then I'm a natural dude 
 And we some natural fools, blowin' out by da' pool 
 She like my sexy coo' mama wit' blades on her barada 
 Rockin' dogi cabana wit' hydro cabana's 
 (Chorus: Major Riley) 
 (Verse 1: Baby Bash (2x):) 
 You know it's leather when we ride 
 Wood grain and raw hide 
 Doin' what we do whatchin' screens gettin' high 
 Girl ya keep it so fly wit' cha sweet hunnybuns 
 You was there when the money gone 
 You'll be there when the money comes 
 (Chorus: Major Riley)
