(Russell Lee) 
 Yeah, Yeah 
 I'm a spit some of this real game 
 Some real shit 
 Some real talk 
 Whoa-oh, Whoa 
 (Richie Rich) 
 Ugh, check my watch 
 Check my chain 
 It's simple and plain 
 The Chevy wit the blew out brains 
 As I bounce and mash 
 Count this cash 
 Floss and flash 
 Cop and blow a zip wit Bash 
 Since everything is big in Texas then where's the zag's? 
 I'm a cross the finish line 
 Tell me where's the flags? 
 Brought my rag top 
 Should have brought the Jag 
 On the beach me and Beesh 
 Look at all this ass 
 I could tell you stories but can show you cash 
 Give you game and secrets that I know you'll pass 
 To the next playa hater 
 And he'll break like glass 
 Now I got a bunch of people digging' through my pads 
 So I choose to floss 
 'Cause who's the boss, let's ink it 
 It's Richie Rich for those who thought re-think it 
 Some yell it and tell it 
 I blow it and smoke it and smell it 
 Let's spend tokens wit my people who sell it, what? 
 (Chorus): Russell Lee 
 I can show you better than I can tell ya, tell ya 
 I can show you better than I can tell ya, tell ya 
 I can show you better than I can tell ya, whoa yeah 
 But it's really nothin' though (But it's really nothin' though) 
 But it's really nothin' though (But it's really nothin' though) 
 (Baby Bash) 
 I could show you somethin' dirty deep up in them corners mayne 
 What the deal? 
 I could bend the block and make it hotter than a Forman grill 
 I got the keys to the Chevy Caprice 
 I could show you mother fuckin' snitches straight to Belize 
 Now that's low 
 Fa sho', conspiracy and parole 
 I could show you real cats doin' time over a ho 
 I could show you poor and happy, or rich one's that lose they mind 
 I could show you dime pieces in school fashion design 
 I could show you street lights and heart beak hotels 
 I could show you young cats gettin' popped wit yayo 
 Down to do what I gotta do to satisfy the man in me 
 And from the looks of thangs the popo's ain't understandin' me 
 The original digital scale reader 
 The pedigree playa who be stackin' his Velveeta 
 I could show you boss stuntin' so fuckin' disgustin' 
 I could show you rapper's frontin' but mayne it's really nothin' 
 (A-Wax) 
 I could show you 
 I could reach you and teach you 
 I know you and where you comin' from 
 I understand it 
 This been goin' on forever dog 
 It's no end 
 Life is like a bullet in your back from a close friend 
 Disappointed to the point where I'm runnin' by myself 
 Never knowin' where I'm goin' start to wonder myself, yeah 
 Money was a necessity 
 My greed got the best of me 
 You think you smokin' Uncle B 
 Who got the recipe? 
 I'm sayin' it's nothin' 
 I say it sincerely, and speakin' clearly 
 I'd rather you respect me than fear me 
 I came a long way and still I got a while to go 
 You probably thinkin' to yourself "What's he smilin' for?" 
 My dog Bash about to be platinum doin' his thang 
 So if you hate him for it, boy you fakin' and know it 
 We takin' this money 
 Big bundles of bills 
 I'm like a whole 'nother person when it come to this skrill
