Low G) 
 Ghetto Soldier, I'm representin' from that Houston 
 Second War, that be the place where I do my dirt 
 Kickin' doors, sellin' dope, only my God knows 
 I have to do what I have to do, just to stay alive 
 I lost a friend, but God blessed me with some real niggaz 
 LSR, I kept it real from the fuckin' start 
 I stay strapped, cause my neighborhood is so dirty 
 I kiss my Grandma goodbye, but my jefa looks so worried 
 Pitbulls from my tierra that I call my home 
 It ain't much, but its something I can call my own 
 I go to war at any times, at any place 
 Why yo punk twelve gauge, all in your face 
 I want your j' s, your jacket, and your jewelry 
 What the fuck you on my block, if you ain't cool with me 
 You crossed the line, ain't no time to press rewind 
 I caught you slippin' 'cause I heard that you dropped a dime 
 On my perro, now he doin' twenty-five to life 
 Low G, now I got to earn another strike 
 Ghetto star, Greyhound is my fuckin' car 
 Ghetto close, but I'm feeling like I'm ghetto far 
 (Chorus: repeat 8X) 
 Don't disrespect my mind - don't disrespect my clika 
 (Baby Bash) 
 A maggets gon' be a magget, fagget's gon' be a fagget 
 But if they want some static, I got an automatic 
 This automatic, if I grab it 
 Sometimes it's tragic, causin havoc 
 Bullets blastin, but he had to have it from startin racket 
 Looked at the wound and autographed it 
 The game is graphic, and the classic, in and out of traffic 
 Money stackin, by any means keep your gadget 
 And find a way to keep supporting my weed habit 
 I get my shit dirt cheifed, the way I like it 
 You disrespect the clik, puto I get excited 
 My trigga finger get itchy, like I was Lionel Richie 
 A Commodore, when I go to war 
 So get down so I can touch you quickly 
 No substitute for these thugs, who love to shoot and cut the loot 
 You fuck with punks, that's why I don't fuck with you 
 Cock strong, pretty boy but don't get it twisted 
 A savage with this beat you want it mayne then come and get it 
 Cause every blow has nothing but these bad intentions 
 So now you know Baby Bash keeps it gut wrenchin'
