 Lemme see ya go mama go mamma 
 Get your girls and put on a show mama 
 Get it on the floor dip it low mama 
 (Baby Bash) 
 I'm a holla back when I pop my collar back 
 Girl I see that dunka dun dunk I want all of dat 
 Follow dat train mane follow that caboosie 
 Ain't nothin' in the world like some thick and some juicy 
 She goin' downtown 'cause her favorite DJ's spinnin 
 I'm all up in the door so I'm already winnin' 
 I got a lotta women but I'm way too choosy 
 And man I love my cake like that Ricky love Lucy 
 On some peanutbutter leather with the wood so grainy 
 It must be rainin dollars 'cause she's lookin' so gravy 
 Sophisticated lady poppin' till the end what it do what it is 
 Baby girl tell me what's hannenin

 Lemme see ya go mama go mamma 
 Get your girls and put on a show mama 
 Get it on the floor dip it low mama 
 (Baby Bash) 
 She move like she dancing on youtube 
 The kinda chica that you really ain't used to 
 Dame lo dame lo momma shoot through 
 In my ear talkin' bout Imma do you 
 Everyone top notchin, everybody watchin 
 Ain't no punk when she pop lock and drop it 
 Straight show stoppin' watchin me perform 
 Got the cyclone ringtone on the phone 
 I'm feelin' on my body baby girl I'm in the zone 
 Must be the goose mixed with a lil trone 
 She make it happin cappin feelin' on me 
 We in the bentley and we feelin' like yeee
