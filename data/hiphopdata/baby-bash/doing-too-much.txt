I'm leaving messages and voice-mails 
 Telling you I miss you 
 Baby, am I doing too much? 
 Why you trynna dis me 
 When I just wanna kiss you 
 Baby, am I doing too much? 
 Baby, tell me what's the issue 
 Who I give these lips to? 
 Baby, am I doing too much? 
 This is turning into 
 Something I ain't hip to 
 Baby, am I doing too much? 
 See you got me all alone 
 Waiting right here by the phone 
 For you to call me 
 Just to hear your voice tone 
 I keep on wonderin' 
 If you was even feelin' me 
 I keep on wonderin' 
 If this was even meant to be 
 Tell me am I wastin' time 
 Boy you're showin' me no signs 
 Is it cause you on your grind 
 Cause you always on my mind 
 I keep on wonderin' 
 If everything you said was true 
 I keep on wonderin' 
 If you were really coming through 
 Now here I go again 
 Blowing you up 
 And my girlfriends keep telling me 
 I'm doing too much 
 Oh, now here I go again 
 Blowing you up 
 And my girlfriends keep telling me 
 I'm doing too much 
 I'm leaving messages and voice-mails 
 Telling you I miss you 
 Baby, am I doing too much? 
 Why you trynna dis me 
 When I just wanna kiss you 
 Baby, am I doing too much? 
 Baby, tell me what's the issue 
 Who I give these lips to? 
 Baby, am I doing too much? 
 This is turning into 
 Something I ain't hip to 
 Baby, am I doing too much? 
 I'm out with my girls 
 Trynna have a good time 
 And you know I'm lookin' fly 
 Trynna meet someother guys 
 But it gets hard sometimes 
 Cause there ain't no one just like you 
 I try my best but I can't shake this 
 Spell you got me through 
 All I can picture is the color of your eyes 
 And the way you make me smile 
 I ain't felt this in a while 
 But I came to the conclusion 
 That this is an illusion 
 Chaos and confusion 
 But I'm not goin' let it ruin 
 The way I feel about myself 
 'Cause I got self-esteem 
 Sometimes I wonder 
 If I'm just chasing a fantasy 
 I'm leaving messages and voice-mails 
 Telling you I miss you 
 Baby, am I doing too much? 
 Why you trynna dis me 
 When I just wanna kiss you 
 Baby, am I doing too much? 
 Baby, tell me what's the issue 
 Who I give these lips to? 
 Baby, am I doing too much? 
 This is turning into 
 Something I ain't hip to 
 Baby, am I doing too much?

 Just leave your name and number 
 And Imma holla at cha 
 Just leave your name and number 
 And Imma holla at cha 
 Just leave your name and number 
 And Imma holla at cha 
 Just leave your name and number 
 And Imma holla at cha 
 'Round your way all day 
 Women in the hallway 
 (?) 
 Losing track of the people 
 Trynna call me 
 Don't take this the wrong way 
 I've been havin' long days 
 Doin' it, movin' 'round town 
 Where ever I'm gettin' my song played 
 Now here I go again 
 Blowing you up 
 And my girlfriends keep telling me 
 I'm doing too much 
 Oh, now here I go again 
 Blowing you up 
 And my girlfriends keep telling me 
 I'm doing too much 
 I'm leaving messages and voice-mails 
 Telling you I miss you 
 Baby, am I doing too much? 
 Why you trynna dis me 
 When I just wanna kiss you 
 Baby, am I doing too much? 
 Baby, tell me what's the issue 
 Who I give these lips to? 
 Baby, am I doing too much? 
 This is turning into 
 Something I ain't hip to 
 Baby, am I doing too much?
