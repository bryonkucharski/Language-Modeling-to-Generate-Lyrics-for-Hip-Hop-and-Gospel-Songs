I don't need no love, all I need is the DJ 
 I don't need no love, all I need is the DJ 
 It was midnight 
 I got the booty call 
 She said "I'm at the club" 
 So I threw on my drawers 
 I'm lookin' throwed in my 'fit 
 Candy coat on my whip 
 The po-po's all on my tip 
 But man, I don't even trip 
 Sent me a dirty text 
 So I text her back 
 Scooped up the Stuey Boy 
 'Cause he had the purple sacks 
 And now we gone with the wind 
 It's on and poppin' again 
 We rebel rockin' and rollin' 
 This club is outta c-, outta c-, ou-ou-outta control 
 She got me outta control 
 She make you go crazy when she out on the on floor 
 She know the DJ, he's on Serato 
 He date them models, he crack them bottles 
 Everybody say, fellas, what do ladies like? Money, money, money 
 Ladies, what do fellas like? They monkey, monkey, monkey 
 Money, money, it's outta control 
 She showed that monkey, whoo, it's outta control 
 I'm double fistin' now, under a strobe light 
 Its lookin' like a movie, but it's feelin' so tight 
 Now I got one in the cage, and I got two on the stage 
 I got a waitress on the under tryna' give me some face 
 They played some Lil Wayne 
 Mixed with some T-Pain 
 They mashed a Journey record 
 Now they dropped some Coldplay 
 And now they playin' my song 
 The girls, they showin' their thongs 
 We rebel rockin' and rollin' 
 This club is outta c-, outta c-, ou-ou-outta control 
 She got me outta control 
 She make you go crazy when she out on the on floor 
 She know the DJ, he's on Serato 
 He date them models, he crack them bottles 
 Everybody say, fellas, what do ladies like? Money, money, money 
 Ladies, what do fellas like? They monkey, monkey, monkey 
 Money, money, it's outta control 
 She showed that monkey, whoo, it's outta control, yes sir! 
 I don't need no love, all I need is the DJ 
 I don't need no love, all I need is the DJ 
 I don't need no love, all I need is the DJ 
 I don't need no love, all I need is the DJ 
 I don't need no love, all I need is the DJ, DJ 
 Outta control, she he got me outta control 
 She make you go crazy when she out on the on floor 
 She know the DJ, he's on Serato 
 He date them models, he crack them bottles 
 Everybody say, fellas, what do ladies like? Money, money, money 
 Ladies, what do fellas like? They monkey, monkey, monkey 
 Money, money, it's outta control 
 She showed that monkey, whoo, it's outta control, yes sir! 
 Eh, eh, it's outta control 
 Eh, eh, it's outta control 
 Eh, eh, it's outta control 
 Eh, eh, it's outta control 
 It's outta control, control, control
