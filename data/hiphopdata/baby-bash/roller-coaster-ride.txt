Baby Bash, Mikael, 
 What is it? 
 Your body's like a rollercoaster 
 My favorite attraction let me get closer, 
 You're the drug I got addicted 
 This time I'm pleading guilty 
 I know I'll be convicted, 
 I lose the sense of gravity 
 When you start moving on me 
 We're on the same orbit 
 You know that I love it, 
 I was poisoned You're the remedy 
 When you're kissing over me 
 Baby what d'you do to me. 
 Laughing, smiling telling jokes is how we does our thang, 
 Take me for that ride, let your boy inside let me bring you pleasure-pain, 
 Is it just a game No Way Jose bust about you all night and day, 
 I'm a ride you like I ride that wave let me keep you hotter then a microwave. 
 And it just don't stop, we bubbuling till we pop, it's good to the last drop, I'm loving that woopwop! 
 And it just don't stop, we bubbuling till we pop, it's good to the last drop, I'm loving that woopwop!

 You'll stay close to me 'cause I need you so 
 You will never be, far away from me 
 I would get crazy, and would miss you so
