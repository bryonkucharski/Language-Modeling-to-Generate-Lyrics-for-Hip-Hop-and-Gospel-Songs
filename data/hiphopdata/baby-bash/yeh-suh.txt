 (Yeah Suh!) 
 No Lie 
 (Yeah Suh!) 
 Off the Trank and the dank so High 
 (Yeah Suh!) 
 It's my arrival, and my survival 
 I'm skyin higher then messiah an' his bible 
 Watch for that rifle 
 Watch for that psycho 
 Yo breezy chosen, n she lookin' kinda tight though 
 Now if you talk that talk 
 Ya better walk that walk 
 Don't let this pretty face fool ya 
 'Cause I'm a savage 
 Like a Dallas Maverick 
 Got nephews that'll do ya 
 Snatch that jeerzy off your skeleton with the quickness 
 And if its wall ta wall betta guard your jaw we handlin bi'ness 
 Servin' this game like tennis we up in this mean Muggin 
 Crackin' the fuck up at them squares dream thuggin' 
 Blowin' our trees cousin 
 It gets sticky in the pain 
 Tricky in the tank 
 And don't miss me wit that dank 
 500 on the street equals 65 G's 
 In that Jordan briefcase like that boy from the piz 
 Bigger then show biz 
 So I'm stayin focused 
 When they holla at the club 
 "How much them blows is"

 Showed me how ta slang heat Hollerin 
 Fixin how ta talk man we gona bring beat Ya 
 Now guess what I'm goin' through and this what I stand fo 
 Thuggin' ain't that legal but I'm doin' what I can boy 
 But I sound small I as I is 
 Sound as raw as I is 
 I pop 'n' lift mic's while I bench press heads 
 Down is all in it 
 See niggaz ballin in it 
 Aiighty, tellin' a sad story we know why I got it 
 Niggas bad at the game they ain't showin no love 
 That's cold nigga deal with it show'em you thug 
 Havin', Partnah's in prision n a few dead friends 
 Was the Streets way of showin me two dead ends 
 Then the beats got to showin me you can make ends 
 Goin' hard in the pank when the pussy boys can't 
 One thug that had some said that boy Bash 
 That manilla world send max pain comin' for that ass. YESSAH!
