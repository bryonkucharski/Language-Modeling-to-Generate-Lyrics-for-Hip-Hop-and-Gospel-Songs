 Sexy butterfly, skin tone butterscotch 
 The finest linen, the type of ish she love to cop 
 The miss Stiletto heels, she a fan of Barcelona 
 She hating attention, but every naked eye on her 
 Straight out of Arizona, I told her that I'm a loner 
 I'm offering crystal, but she prefer lime and Corona 
 Super Saucy, Sergio ??? sandals 
 And when she in the Jacuzzi ooh, she lighting candles 
 Stuntin all the way across the floor for sure 
 Freshly molded by the hands of the lord and oh 
 Heavens angel, curves in every angle 
 Time play two to tango, bring the hook sang 
 (Chorus-Avant) 
 You're the apple of my eye 
 I'm feeling like a drug I'm so high 
 Everything is so sweet 
 Like a peach, strawberry baby your saucy 
 So take a ride with me off in the whip 
 I'll push the keys to you just let me 
 Everything is so sweet 
 Like a peach, strawberry baby your saucy 
 (Verse-Baby Bash) 
 Uh, I'm trying to get it crunk-a-lating between us I'm saying 
 You on the brink of bubble-lating, your body's displaying 
 And I'm a spitter on the come up been patiently waiting 
 To tour Jamaica, maybe meet a couple Jamaicans 
 That makes us equally compatible, expectations 
 For you its education, for me is to rock the nation 
 Now that's a combination we should be modulating 
 Crunching on Greek salad under some conversation 
 Sipping on apple pucker twerping that mariuchi 
 I'm digging the purse, your matching, that's authentic guuchi 
 And you the chick that I been searching for across the globe 
 And I just wanted you to know... 
 Let's get it crunk-a-lating 
 Let's get it bubble-lating 
 You got the Motts and I'm a boss 
 Yeah that I'm saying
