I'm standing on the curb, 
 Puffin on the herb, 
 Tryin' get what a mother fucker deserve, 
 I'm trying stay high, 
 True to the trilla, 
 Tryin' get richer 'cause it all about them illaz, 
 I'm standing on the curb, 
 Puffin on the herb, 
 Tryin' get what a mother fucker deserve, 
 I'm trying stay high, 
 True to the trilla, 
 Tryin' get richer 'cause it all about them illaz, 
 Well that's the way I put it down, 
 R & D we faced the clown, 
 Purple essence all around, 
 See me and my folks we blaze the pounds, 
 Ain't no brown, it's all green, 
 Playas know what the hell I mean, 
 A whole new scheme, a whole new dream, 
 I just got me a triple beam, 
 From a dope feen, 
 But he a homie though, 
 Use to be a balla, 
 Till he started using all his dough, 
 Rock it up, Chop it up and a Sack it up, 
 All true to the rules may be, 
 No fool you always actin' up, 
 And they know woofin, 
 They loving what these gentles cookin, 
 That's why I'm jukin, 
 That candy crème, wit that puddin', 
 Baby Bash all about that cash, 
 And that Mary Jane, 
 You know tha game, 
 I gots to gets tha money man, 
 My playz dreams are magical, 
 My top notch game is valuable, 
 I'm stackin my mathematical, 
 'Cause I just bumped me a badder hoe, 
 A Las Vegas Nevada hoe, 
 Strip her into national, 
 Some big old tits and ass an all, 
 She loves all by that grass I grow, 
 Her schedule ain't flexible, 
 They all live in Mexico, 
 Got a semi truck with hella blow, 
 And he scats across the border hoe, 
 That's why, the duck is coming buckets, 
 Posted on the gizzard 
 Blowing sweets like they gots trumpets, 
 Before I run out 
 Let me be cocky 'cause I have the habit, 
 That fluffy rabbit, 
 That Purple puss, 
 That white magic, 
 It got them feening, 
 For a mouth piece that be poppin' pees an, 
 Got them sick and queezin, 
 Can't let them haters be the reason, 
 You taking losses, 
 Fuckin' off ur credit that ain't cool, 
 Then you wonder why these fool ride and blast at you, 
 That's the game and the game gonna take a stride, 
 Its Baby Bash, baby boy I'm come take a ride.
