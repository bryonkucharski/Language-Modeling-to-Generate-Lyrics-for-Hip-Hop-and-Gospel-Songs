She got a caramel, round, round, brown 
 Make me go crazy when she come around 
 Baby is my buttakup, oh, I got a sweet tooth 
 Baby is my buttakup, oh, I, oh, I got a sweet tooth 
 When she got them skinny jeans, body down low 
 She's my baby candy, had to let her know 
 Baby is my buttakup, oh, I got a sweet tooth 
 Baby is my buttakup, oh, I, oh, I got a sweet tooth 
 Yeah, you crossin' out yo label, girl, you bustin' all night 
 Not a top notch top rank or top flight 
 But it ain't a butta finga or it ain't a babe ruth 
 Got ya dancin' way loose like you off the gray goose 
 Caramel dummy's on my mind on the frappachino 
 Betty crocker dunkin' hines taste like rios 
 Her body so Cleo colder then Alaska 
 Break me off slow she gone break me off fast 
 And you know she broke me off from the south to the north 
 East to the west, baby, do it so soft 
 Got me singin' boy, yoy, boy, yoy 
 She got that goody gum drop, oh boy 
 She got a caramel, round, round, brown 
 Make me go crazy when she come around 
 Baby is my buttakup, oh, I got a sweet tooth 
 Baby is my buttakup, oh, I, oh, I got a sweet tooth 
 When she got them skinny jeans, body down low 
 She's my baby candy, had to let her know 
 Baby is my buttakup, oh, I got a sweet tooth 
 Baby is my buttakup, oh, I, oh, I got a sweet tooth, sweet tooth 
 Let's feelin' tastes great, that's my thang 
 Honey buns dum dums coconut cream 
 Cut her up clean 'cause she sweeter then my swisha 
 I give her cap a key everytimes I get wit her 
 She's my cover girl, lover girl, sweet as Amaretto 
 Lookin' so vicious when she do it in stilettos 
 Hip hop or heavy metal, she workin' that Jello 
 And she love to bring it home and help me count my spinedo 
 Kisses for my lady cadyver 
 I ain't got a square, I gots me a ryder 
 Put her on the flyer, betcha club jump off right 
 Guarantee she gone, keep it bumpin' all night 
 She got a caramel, round, round, brown 
 Make me go crazy when she come around 
 Baby is my buttakup, oh, I got a sweet tooth 
 Baby is my buttakup, oh, I, oh, I got a sweet tooth 
 When she got them skinny jeans, body down low 
 She's my baby candy, had to let her know 
 Baby is my buttakup, oh, I got a sweet tooth 
 Baby is my buttakup, oh, I, oh, I got a sweet tooth, sweet tooth 
 You're my top notch, lady make the club go crazy 
 Let me see ya goody, goody gum drop 
 Thicka then a snicka with her body off the liquor 
 Let me see ya goody, goody gum drop 
 If you're sexy and you know it and you're not afraid to show it 
 Let me see ya goody, goody gum drop 
 And get your frame off the chain', make ya say mane 
 Let me see ya goody, goody gum drop 
 She got a caramel, round, round, brown 
 Make me go crazy when she come around 
 Baby is my buttakup, oh, I got a sweet tooth 
 Baby is my buttakup, oh, I, oh, I got a sweet tooth 
 When she got them skinny jeans, body down low 
 She's my baby candy, had to let her know
