(Cormega) 
 As death nears you sink deeper 
 In his reach as you're caressed by the grim reaper 
 As my heat enters your flesh, you begin to meet up 
 With the same streets you claimed was yours they remain yours 
 Your blood stains the floor where the candles were lit 
 Your thugs came to mourn but ain't handling shit 
 Your drugs are now my drugs 
 I can't front your re-up was a little more than mines was 
 I didn't kill you, greed did 
 Son, you think I only know niggaz in Queensbridge, I'm a made nigga 
 An outlaw, you can take it to your grave nigga 
 Eternally known my heat blaze niggaz 
 Stuck me for that Q, should've never bucked it 
 The eleventh commandment, is never fuck me 
 You hit me in the chest 
 Lucky I was wearing a vest but the impact hurt my fucking flesh 
 Fucked up my avirex and made my neighbors upset 
 Your own gun created your death 
 Look at you now, a reminder of consequences 
 In the street, but loyalty is nearly non-existent (that's deep) 
 You should've seen yo man faces when I came to the wake 
 Had the mac with the compressor, under my black leather 
 Bitches crying niggaz eyeing whispering "that's Mega" 
 Tension in the air I pause 
 Ice grills turned to fear 
 You don't want it 
 I let them breathe at the same time yes believe "coming here fronting" 
 You never leave, as I approach your open casket 
 I'm in your face like "damn I smoked this bastard" 
 You was a dead man walking 
 Now you a live nigga laying in the coffin...
