Pardon me brother 
 As you stand in your glory 
 I know you won't mind 
 If I tell the whole story 
 I had the streets waiting 
 Like a drought, my niggaz be patient 
 My daughter was recently born, I took a brief hiatus 
 Then Ty died, then I fell into a deep oasis 
 Others sparred, which reappeared, when Spree' was traded 
 Love is love, even with people hatingg 
 Niggaz be slingin' daily, with no hope, expect for beatin' cases 
 I frequent places, where single mothers, are teens with babies 
 And fatherless homes are common as police who hate us 
 For the color of our skin, or the v's we came in 
 Rockin' these beats, doin' those sneakers, my scheme be plannin' 
 Since I came with The Realness, I been labeled the illest 
 Dealer, M.C., leavin' people amazed with my lyrics 
 We don't need you to feel us, just recognize 
 We in the building, with heaters concealed 
 Burnin' our name in the ceiling, Legal Hustle, nigga 
 My hood divided, I don't fuck with the niggaz from the other side 
 My homies drop it, like flies 
 Painful timems have a nigga livin' reckless 
 All I expected was to see another day 
 Take my momma out the pj's, it got's to be another way 
 They pumpin' on my chest, and I'm screamin' 
 I stop breathing, my love one's leaving 
 Money never went to those that really need it 
 Brownsville, Bed-Stuy and Fort Green and 
 The whole Eastside's sayin' 'fuck the police' 
 On the mic, I'm a beast 
 The church tried to critize me for my disbelief 
 Mentally I'm at war, I'mma smorse' it all 
 Trials and tribulations, false accusations 
 Of me, being in deep, we'll shit, they rob me, nigga 
 Stay on a mission, checkin' my trigger, you niggaz figure 
 Thinkin' for some reason, this ruger won't make your body shiver 
 But I'mma let you know, from the start 
 I was born at this game, now it's a shame to seen it torn apart 
 Moms cryin', never knew what son had beef 
 Kissin' his cheeks, and a heart's feelin' nothin' but grief 
 Receivin' reefs, placin' him at his feet 
 It's kinda fucked up, to see things happenin' in the streets 
 Nine-three it was ill in my town 
 You either buck now, or lay down, or let a nigga feel your pound 
 That's how it be up in the streets 
 Money hungry bitches is bigger, noted 
 But to just let them live, I'm for this eat 
 And I'mma tell you about niggaz with money 
 Sorry to say but us blacks be actin' real funny 
 That's why I deaded Moe on the eighth 
 Because every time we drama, he always end up coming late 
 Nowadays niggaz get snaked for being fake 
 Airin' cats out, and takin' trips out of state 
 That's how it be up in the city, where niggaz act shitty 
 Gettin' shift and pretty, I'm trynna hold like Biggie 
 You niggaz with me, against me, don't' try to stick me 
 Playin' both sides, I'm bustin' you until I'm empty 
 Legal Hustle, nigga...
