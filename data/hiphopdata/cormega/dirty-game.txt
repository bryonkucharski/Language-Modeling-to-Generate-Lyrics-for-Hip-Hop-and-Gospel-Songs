Yeah 
 Know what I'm sayin' Premo' 
 Tell these niggas about my life know what I mean 
 It's been a crazy, crazy journey for me, know what I mean 
 I spend my days in a steel cage 
 Where brothers feel rage 
 And get real with razor blades 
 In ill ways so when my cell close 
 My brain cells expose 
 And my pen excels to a part of hell froze 
 Inside of me was tellin' me to stay out 
 Reality was tellin' me that if I find a way out 
 I had to stay out 
 Plans I had to lay out 
 In order to elevate from my identity 
 Mentally accelerate 
 I seen a lot of men break down 
 Being an inmate 
 Now I realize I couldn't make the same mistakes 
 It was real being concealed in steel gates 
 Where brothers who feel hate against a another race 
 Which only indicates a snake mentality 
 These are my days of reality 
 The streets is a dirty game 
 My heart's still home in the streets 
 It's a damn shame 
 The streets is a dirty game 
 But niggas stay strapped in the hood 
 It's a damn shame 
 The streets is a dirty game 
 My heart's still home in the streets they still callin' 
 It's a damn shame 
 The streets is a dirty game 
 But niggas stay strapped in the hood 
 It's a damn shame 
 The streets is a dirty game 
 My heart's still home in the streets 
 Often I think of my people the board denied they freedom, a mirage 
 Disappearing before our eyes 
 We were born to strife 
 Now living in courts decide 
 Missing their children we can feel it when our mommas cry 
 We was hustlin' but would the jury find me guilty? 
 They seen us strugglin' 
 Doing what we have to do to ease the sufferin' 
 We know its wrong but so was havin' us freezin' 
 Left the stove on wearing our sneakers until the soles are gone 
 We constantly holdin' on, being broke 
 And hopin our phone is our only escape 
 And when our favorite TV shows is on shots ringin' echo in the ear before the cops came kids was everywhere 
 And women cryin niggas going to jail 
 A mothers eyes fill with tears as she nears 
 Realizing he's surviving she exhales like Angela Bassett 
 I'm a poet amongst slums, crimes, and crack addicts 
 I live a lonely existence 
 Lately I've become a mathematician 
 As I divide my friends with phony niggas I confide in God 
 As for sins may he forgive 'em 
 If you have dreams they can be achieved never give up 
 Look at me once a convicted felon 
 Once addicted to sellin' 
 The substance which corrupted many men in my era 
 I stood in awe at the dope fiends 
 Drove by those caught in the coke game 
 Some proper some locked up some sold claim 
 The main team wanted the shine 
 Streets so alive I felt the air breathe 
 Not only did I misplace time 
 I could remember as an inmate 
 At midstate I stayed in the law library 
 Some chose to lift weight, fine 
 As if they content with they time 
 They strip us at the visit 
 Limit our education 
 Ridicule us niggas 
 Modern enslavement 
 Even though I'm out of the cages 
 I'm the voice of the soldier in the yard with the banger
