 (Cormega) 
 Cormega the illest 
 Niggaz feel this 
 My rhymes and raps 
 Like dmx 
 I'll kill this 
 One final request 
 I'll fulfill the this 
 Niggaz don't know the 
 Shit I grew up wit 
 Single parent home 
 Welfare checks 
 No phones 
 Still surviving, multiplying 
 Trying to make it 
 In the rap game 
 The only sane nigga 
 I never would complain 
 I put crack aside 
 Tried the hip hop ride 
 Stepped my game up 
 Layed the bitch up 
 In 99 I try to make my shit blow up 
 Cause a nigga young as me 
 Never thuggin' 
 But still known as a g 
 Can you feel me, no 
 But you know I'm there 
 Creepin' through your crib at night 
 Kill yo mamma 
 Your brutha, your sister, and your wife 
 Some call me trife 
 But it's all 'cause I live a thug life 
 It's a thug life nigga 
 Say whut??? 
 It's a thug life nigga 
 Say whut??? 
 It's a thug life nigga 
 Say whut??? 
 It's a thug life nigga 
 Say whut??? 
 [Crystal: Singin] Thug Life 
 (Cormega) 
 Sometimes fear takes control of us all 
 Niggaz never realize 
 The seriousness of it all 
 Jelously and envy 
 Takin' over the streets 
 Make a nigga like me wonder what 
 We did to deserve these feats 
 Hungry children in the ghetto 
 Without enough to eat 
 Families in housing projects during 
 The winter without no heat 
 Speak about it all you want 
 With reverand jesse jackson 
 With faracon, cochran, 
 And mr. affirmative action 
 That's just step one son 
 Apply it to life 
 Just like the law about handguns 
 And remember no nigga out there 
 Should have to lose his life 
 Fuck it 
 I guess it's just thug life 
 (Cormega) 
 Them muthafuckas on wall street 
 Don't give a fuck about the ghetto 
 They would rather suck dick than help you 
 And ain't afraid to let you know 
 Then they run for office 
 Get up and talk shit 
 Win your vote, get elected 
 And don't do shit 
 I was born and raised 
 A new york native 
 Sold drugs, got paid, 
 Until the operation was raided 
 It makes me sick, day after day 
 That bum *(clinton) smokes celtzer (weed) 
 And gets mad paid 
 The government will never get rid of drugs 
 They get too much money for it 
 Congressmen shoot up 
 And then go to work and legislate 
 Sounds great 
 I wish I was a politician 
 My only mission would 
 Be to smack crack and pretend like I'm listening 
 So fuck 'em 
 We'll handle our problems on our own 
 They'll probably get mad, try to to take our life 
 Well nigga 
 That's just thug life 
 (Cormega) 
 Yo this is cormega 
 And I'm here to tell all of you 
 Livin' on the streets 
 In housin' projects 
 And in ghettos 
 To keep ya head up 
 Times are bad on the streets 
 Killin' and shit 
 But I want each and everyone of you 
 To keep up hope 
 Peace out
