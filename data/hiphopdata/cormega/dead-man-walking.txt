(He got the slip on you) 
 This how it went down... 
 I had to undergo therapy, not surgery 
 The nigga wetted me but, he didn't murder me 
 Dun, I survived 
 He thought that I died 
 Now it's time to throw the nine clip in, mission revenge 
 Once was friends, now that shit's dead 
 That stupid muthafucka shoulda shot me in the head 
 So I went to Brooklyn and met with Dread 
 And told Dread, I want the pussy clot shot dead 
 That nigga started a war fuckin' with me yo 
 Hit me with a four-four and jetted with a kilo 
 He hit me in the chest 
 Lucky I was wearing a vest, but the impact hurt my fuckin' flesh 
 Right after he left, I noticed I was bleeding by my neck 
 And I was type-scared to death 
 Yo, I blacked out 
 I woke up, my man had the mac out 
 Said we gonna get the nigga back no doubt 
 He told me to rest 
 I seen my nigga standing at the door with a tec 
 In case a muthafucker flex 
 I told him how the muthafuckin kid co-flipped 
 And he said parlay son, payback's a bitch 
 Yo, shit is real, I feel better 
 Word out on the street is that a four-four can't stop Mega 
 The nigga musta heard I didn't die, son he hidin' 
 I snatched up his man inside a van and started drivin' 
 His man started dymin' 
 Said the nigga drivin' in 735 and he knows where to find him 
 Cool, tell my man to drop the kid off 
 Soon as we hit the next darn block, blew his fuckin' wig off 
 Now that's one down, one nigga to go 
 Just drive slow so we don't have to worry 'bout five-o 
 Now it's time to get even, 
 We in, five jeeps deep with the mad heat and steamin 
 Oh shit, I see him, he gettin' out the seven 
 My man started wetting at the nigga with a mac-11 
 I specialize in war 
 Now it's time to blow him, I'ma show him how to use a fuckin' four-four 
 I said "yo son, ya games over" 
 I let off, and yo my shit was spittin' fire like a flamethrower 
 He started wettin back 
 I caught him in his fuckin' back 
 When he flung, I think his lungs collapsed 
 He just a dead man walking 
 Ay yo, fuck that shit... I'm through talking 
 (Gunshot)
