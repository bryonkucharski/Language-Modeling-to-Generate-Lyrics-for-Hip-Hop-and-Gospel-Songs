Yo I write rhymes for beemers, rovers, overachievers 
 Drug kingpins who pick up more than one ki up 
 Inmates in every state, live heavyweights 
 Who had they own estate like scarface with large gates 
 Five-star luxury cars in your garage 
 Niggaz who live and die to get large and get power 
 Yo I write like a scholar in Asia praisin Allah 
 Amazing how a rhyme could make alot of dollars 
 I seen feens devour white powders sniffed in bills 
 And get mad if a portion of a gram get spilled 
 For real I analyze like the livest soldier 
 Yo my rhymes are designed like the finest scultpture 
 So exotic, the LS Lex, neck brolic 
 Wherever snakes dwell death follows 
 The best knowledge is respect power 
 And never test ours 
 Cause live niggaz lay, stiffer than dead flowers 
 I represent excellence, my minds an eye 
 My third eye an extra clip yet to flip 
 So never question this 
 Poetry I'm manifesting this 
 Graffiti filled testament 
 (Mega talking) 
 Yeah you know, this is like uncut raw dope you know? 
 Bag this up, ship this to every hood 
 Nawmsayin' son? 
 You pump this on your block 
 This is what I stand for, my clientele you know 
 Then after that we have a major distribution of this, werd 
 Yo I need stacks of green, either rap or crack to feens 
 Its mad trife I seen indictments trap my team 
 Life is felonies, fear and jealousy then death finally appears 
 Save your tears 
 When I rhyme niggaz be wildin' 
 Enemies silent 
 My mic temperature is like a Caribbean island 
 Consider me, living energy 
 My poetry, so complex whatever I bless you know it's me 
 I hear the anguish, vulgar truth, forbidden language 
 If I'm getting two D's peak, and I'll explain shit 
 Yo, I knew a few who never showed true love 
 I'm condemned due to my association with thugs 
 The streets raised me, made me, the weak praised me 
 Indeed it was written you will one day betray me 
 Listen, as my money starts to escalade I estimate 
 Fake thugs forbidden, written in my testament 
 (Mega talking) 
 Yeah, don't even question it 
 It's real right now, nawmsayin'? 
 We gonna establish our own commission 
 Have our own business 
 The east the west 
 The money green on your side the money green on my side 
 Let's get it, let's get it together 
 Younawmean? 
 My testament, it's what I stand for 
 You either with me or you against me
