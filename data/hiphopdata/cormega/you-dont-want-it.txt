 Yo, guerilla war nigga, what 
 Guerilla war nigga, what what 
 Guerilla war nigga, what what 
 Guerilla war nigga, what what 
 Guerilla war nigga 
 It's on 
 (Cormega) 
 Yo, y'all niggas don't know the art of war 
 Now you dyin' and my gun'll keep burstin' till your mama cryin' 
 I'm defying your whole crew, y'all niggas weak 
 It could be on officially if you had heart 
 Nigga your overrated, props old decaying 
 Not known for sprayin', what the fuck you sayin' 
 Your crew fell, you jeal', 'cause mine doin' it 
 Yo quit the jealousy, let's get the felonies 
 My niggas sellin' keys, your niggas sellin' dreams 
 Your plans ain't precise, you need better schemes 
 'Cause yo, I ain't tryin' to lose another nigga 
 And if so enough blood is spilt to fill a river 
 And I'll part the Red Sea like Moses dad 
 And smite my enemies despite the penalties 
 You could live like kings, but die from injuries 
 You about to be a memory nigga (You don't want it!) 
 I don't hate you, I despise you 
 I call you cocksucker, 'cause it describes you 
 I know you wish you had a real crew, like I do 
 Niggas'll send shots and get props like my crew 
 Look at you nigga, you had status, most of that vanished 
 Y'all niggas has been, addicts, unestablished 
 What the fuck happened? You had the block clickin' 
 Now you in denial, y'all are finished 
 You out position, but you no competition 
 To my niggas with heaters yo, we not feelin' you either, what 
 You wanna talk violent, but Sig P.'s for solution 
 I stalk silent, when I precede execution 
 Taught by the, realest niggas to walk the planet 
 With one thought you vanish, like the corp remanded 
 You on the ave with your weak man's frontin' 
 When you see my niggas comin' (You don't want it!) 
 My nigga Biggie must have prophesized 
 When he said somebody got to die 
 I'm like the jackal, when I attack you die from gat wounds 
 Frank Nitty couldn't do it that smooth 
 Life's a bitch, I'm the pimp, you own Mad Duke's crew 
 I proved you weak, you ride dick to eat 
 You ain't real, ill, or prepared to kill 
 Man you better chill, you could get it for real 
 I live this life of gangstas, ever second it's changin' 
 The enemy is rarely a stranger 
 The treachery in the heart cemented jealousy's best friend 
 That's the reason felonies will never end 
 How you feel is mutual, I don't fear retaliation, I'm shootin' you 
 This is a mere evaluation, I do what you to scared to do 
 Motherfucker I'm prepared, you don't, want it nigga
