Even though mad niggas hate it 
 I remain the most anticipated 
 Those glad a nigga made it bast your Nickel-plateds 
 And salute the realness, 'cause mad niggas fake it 
 When I peel hit the floor 
 I conceal bricks so raw 
 I got the sickest Six-Four you ever seen 
 I saw and conquered 
 When it's on and poppin' my Dogs are barkin' 
 To eat food, my enemies feel heat like Purico 
 Some suggest they're equal 
 Lyrically I'm like a Desert Eagle 
 Mentally I measure Kilos 
 Physically I'm compared to Tito Trinidad, both hands are lethal 
 The crowned Prince 
 My underground shit you don't fuck around wit' 
 I move pies and fire loud shit 
 I'm in the tunnel with the crowd nigga fuck V.I.P 
 Where Brooklyn go crazy when you bump B.I.G. and Queens feel it when you 
 Pump that Mobb Deep 
 That Jay-Z and Nas beef doesn't involve me 
 I'm sorry, legal hustle, Infamous affiliated 
 Last rapper to test me I humiliated 
 And for your information the jewels ain't rented from Jacob 
 When I move I leave a dent in the pavement 
 My name ring in jail and not for givin' no statement 
 That type of foulness consider it flagrant 
 O.T., give me a brick and see I'm gifted as Masons 
 I'm the realness, you spittin' that fake shit 
 Life's a bitch, I'ma take her on an expensive vacation 
 If it's on I'm the Reaper with the glistenin' bracelet 
 Sleepers awakened 
 Screamin' like they seen Satan 
 Word to Christ I need paper, keep the fake love 
 A fake thug couldn't sell a rock on the block I was raised on 
 Huh?! 
 Get out my way, gimmie mine or I'ma take what's yours 
 Make love war, spray up doors 
 Get out my way, you industry, we in the street 
 Wit' the heat pickin' weight up raw 
 Get out my way, stop screamin' what set you rep if you don't come around 
 The way no more 
 Get out my way, who want what, say no more 
 Matter fact that chain off Dog. 
 I gave niggas enough time - to front 
 I'm a beast on the street like crushed white 
 You can't be me, close your eyes, you can't see me 
 I'm the phantom in your concience 
 The shadow in the darkness 
 Savage when I write, I'm heartless 
 I'm iller than you, realer than you 
 Still with more Killers than you 
 It's mandatory, I'm self explanatory 
 Don't front on me, you didn't have cash before me 
 I'm the essence 
 You don't gotta like it, respect it 
 Like the ice on my necklace 
 And the fact I'm supplyin' connections 
 If you rhyme ill I'm the sickness that caused it, you thought you'd 
 Assume my position 
 I be hustlin', bubblin', gettin' money 
 Causin' blind rage with the Twenties 
 Y'all niggas is funny like Martin Lawrence 
 We out before the Narcs get on us 
 My life wasn't written, yours was, you livin' a lie 
 I'm dealin' wit' pies, all feelings aside 
 My enemies kneel when I rise 
 The realness in my eyes 
 From blood, sweat, and tears I cried 
 I got friends who died before they got to see me shine 
 How dare you compare your weak CD to mine 
 Or think you could see me with rhymes 
 Easily I'm, nicer than you and all your peoples combined.
