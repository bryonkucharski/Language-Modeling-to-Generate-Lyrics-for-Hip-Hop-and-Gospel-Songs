Yeah 
 Little Brother, uh 
 Khyrsis on the boards with the heat 
 Ah, 'Mega, yo 
 They wanna know who it is, it's I who doin' it 
 Rapper bring it iller than most, no brag, no boast, I tell it like it is 
 Been across the globe, couple records sold 
 Couple hoes lost control, I ain't tryin' have kids 
 Tryin' have biz, import, export 
 UPS-out sort, minority on 'scort 
 Loyal on the team, got my people's L back 
 My brother Ronnie back, tryin' keep him out of court 
 Keep him out of sorts with the same drug hustle 
 Eight years later, we facin a new struggle 
 Bet it all, black, tryin' see my money double 
 Spun it to the red, now I know we all in trouble 
 [Unverified] both startin' to bubble 
 Both startin' to hustle, stack our chips 
 I thought I went straight when we first started out 
 But now I'm lookin' back, neither one is legit, shit 
 Yeah uh 
 Niggaz sayin' Phonte's the embodiment 
 Of hip-hop, so when my shit drop 
 Just cop any verse and watch him body it 
 Leave your team stone faced like monuments 
 Cross-country, shit, I'm cross-continents 
 Take a trip where we get that dough 
 Niggaz lookin' at me like, "Is that so?" 
 But we flip that dough and dip like condiments 
 Cheap nigga but I still stay confident 
 Hell, I'm only payin' taxes and compliments 
 While all of y'all watch me, there's been a murder 
 Y'all should call for the autopsy 
 Or call the law, somebody should stop me 
 Killin' each track is the shit I'm on 
 QB to NC is how we get it on 
 LB and 'Mega real rap Renaissance, check it out 
 My lyrical skills is superior to many arguably 
 Mental energy generate artistry 
 And hip-hop is not deceased, it's dealing with Christ 
 Ironically yet His calm'll manifest it like a prophesy 
 The art was disregarded for economy 
 They played us, it ain't like the labels let the artist eat 
 They bait us with dreams of dreams poverty 
 VMA'ed ya, yet they pay us like minorities 
 Need to raise up like a Quantum Leap 
 Stay up, ain't no time to sleep 
 Save and buy some property, then cop you a V 
 Acknowledge these jewels are conflict free 
 I style on you when I rhyme and that was just me 
 The last MC on the track with LB 
 (Shit) 
 My rhymes are doper than a crack head's dream 
 I drew more text than Artest's sheet 
 Which means even the haters must respect my game
