(Man talking) Yo Mega man, what's the deal son? 
 (Mega) Yo son, whattup? 
 (Man) Yo, I'm just sittin' here, zonin' out, thinkin' about how life is 
 Yo, life's general for us, you know? how we livin' out here, you know, 
 Things we go through man, why we gotta go through this life? 
 (Mega) Life is an interlude to death son, you ever thought about that? 
 The saga begins 
 I'm a reflection of the drama within 
 The ghetto I live in, niggas Moms on crack, Pops just disappeared 
 The first time you get locked up who really cares? 
 I see a little snotty nosed with his sneakers on backwards 
 Sleepin' on a mattress when I go to make a sale 
 At times I wonder, are we goin' straight to Hell? 
 Or does God realize we're tryin' to make it as well 
 My sleep is interrupted by food on the stove 
 Not gun shots, we're immune to those 
 Some of my friends first bids are two to fours 
 Others are on the run with huge rewards 
 Mothers watch Son's walk through the door 
 For the last time till they go view at the morgue 
 Life is deep, we all just tryin' to eat 
 Rap's a mental narcotic, I supply the streets 
 Look at my life, you see white coke and black roses 
 And tears shed for passed soldiers 
 We all walkin' the path chosen 
 From the cradle till the casket's lowered 
 I still got the black ski mask to throw on 
 But I can get richer off the tracks I flow on 
 I'd be lyin' if I said I wasn't hustlin' no more 
 Look at my life... 
 Life ain't fair, shorty pregnant with nowhere to live 
 Sleepin' in a crackhouse 'cause she don't got no relatives 
 Her friends want to drink brew and beef about who's sale it is 
 Now she's gettin' hungry, she smells the marijuana scent 
 I paint a picture vividly 
 As if Picasso's spirit entered me 
 Starin' at the Heavens, secluded in a tinted jeep 
 I'm sick of hearin' eulogies 
 I realize my nigga Blue is - a reminder of my past like Greek ruins 
 Yet his seek keeps bloomin' 
 Uneffected by police intrusions 
 Or street illusions we were consumed wit' 
 I've even grown away from people I grew wit' 
 I mean we cool, but I don't need to bullshit 
 My mood could switch easily from smooth to ruthless 
 We ain't built the same so mind games are useless 
 Times change, like the climate I change 
 Check the forecast, I reign 
 Live niggas I rep for, deceased, I pour Moet for 
 Those incarcerated, my heart is wit' y'all 
 I know at times it gets hard behind penetentiary bars 
 Then once free you realize you're mentally scarred 
 If not physically, if subjected to correctional facilities 
 Prepare for your future to the best of your ability prosper, otherwise 
 You've been conquered 
 Blowin' up her mobile phone so she can send you a box 
 Son, I sit inside my residence 
 And thank God I'm blessed with this poetical gift evident in every 
 Ghetto like graffiti and crack sales 
 And cabs that won't stop for Black Males 
 Undercovers givin' younger Brothers bad stares 
 Fours clap, Dogs crap in the grass here 
 You love to hear the story Son, the saga began here 
 MC are fictitious yet there's actual facts here 
 Like the Bible said, Jesus had napped hair
