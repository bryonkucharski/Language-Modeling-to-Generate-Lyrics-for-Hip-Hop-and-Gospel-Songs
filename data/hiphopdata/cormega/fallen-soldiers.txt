* Differs from The Sqwad's "Fallen Soldiers b/w Straight No Chaser" 12" 
 (Cormega) 
 What, I'ma live for my niggas 
 I'ma shine for my niggas 
 How can I express the sorrow, I learn to dread tomorrow 
 Had to see my nigga Yammy dead, but he can rest with honor 
 'Cause he was reppin on his quest for dollars 
 I was the one who took him Uptown, with someone into measure powder 
 I treasure our memories together, hard to believe 
 I'ma never see you again, but I'ma make you breathin through pen 
 So everyone can see you my friend, in fly sneakers again 
 Life is sweet and kinda deep when it ends 
 Still remember you, beefin over bullshit calls at basketball games cheatin' 
 Yo, my cipher ain't complete, I'm sorry for that argument we had 
 On twelfth street over a sale, knowing well that you was seekin' dough as well 
 What we made up the same night 
 And through the years remained tight, the same love 
 The same drugs rockin' the same Nikes 
 Now that you gone, I'm here to reppin your name right, yo 
 Chorus (Cormega) 
 Did you ever lose a nigga you love? 
 Then ask yourself is there a heaven for thugs? 
 And will you be forgiven when your spirit is judged 
 This song is dedicated to my niggas above 
 Did you ever lose a nigga you love? 
 Then ask yourself is there a heaven for thugs? 
 And will you be forgiven when your spirit is judged 
 This song is dedicated to my niggas above 
 (Cormega) 
 And to my cousin Bam 
 You my fuckin' man, I find it hard to understand 
 You gone, you physical form is dormant 
 I'm lost like the Bulls without Jordan 
 Tell my man J.B. from Edgemere I said peace 
 Son, I live a thug life, I clutch mics 
 With the same intensity that I used to crush white 
 G-Fresh was at your funeral, son I felt it 
 And if I start cryin when I rhyme I can't help it 
 Analyze, never think I forgot you, you my heart 
 And even death can't keep the two of us apart 
 From day one, watchin cartoons and shootin playguns 
 Who ever thought we see this day come 
 Tell my moms I miss her, give her a kiss and tell her 
 That her younger child done her proud 
 I know she heard about me runnin' wild 
 Y'all gone now, but livin' in my memory 
 Fallen soldiers, sleepin' in serenity 
 (Cormega) 
 Killa Black, whattup my nigga? 
 I know you chillin' with my nigga Ill Will 
 Inside a ghetto heaven building 
 With a Mac-11, stealin your jeans, screamin Infamous Queens 
 Forty-First Side kid, you know me 
 I know the O-Z's are whiter there, pussy much tighter there 
 Pac and Eazy-E coming through on low riders there 
 The same old thing, except there ain't no pain 
 Your brother Havoc doing his thing, yo ferreal 
 It's all good in the hood, the Escalade with the wood-grain 
 Son was never misunderstood, dearly departed 
 Hear me acknowledge all my people who passed 
 Whether holdin' heat, or in it for cash 
 Some of y'all led sinister paths, some are pure like 
 Dominican raw, knockin' on heaven's door 
 The only thing my niggas ran from alive is law 
 I reminisce your memories for you this Hennessy we pour 
 Chorus with Variation to last line
