Younawmsayin' son? 
 Shit is real 
 Yo, I'm from a place where niggaz get it on 
 And bullshitters get shitted on 
 And dead niggaz keep living on 
 And memories once the henny's pourin' 
 I see the sadness of so many mourned 
 Yet the beauty of so many born 
 And the only man I trust is god 
 Cause the devil come in many forms 
 On the day I rest eternally 
 I'll be a thug for eternity 
 The longer word is fire burning me 
 But you younger thugs could learn from me 
 Love is love...
