(Feat. Dona) 
 (Cormega) 
 I'm filled with optimism as I write a composition 
 That might ease the hunger pains that'll keep me out of prison 
 Some claim they use to hustle in they verses 
 I'm cursed with a past addiction, of getting paid off crack addictions 
 Glad I'm living, shit changed I'm looking at flicks of fam who's missing 
 Some angels, some in prison 
 Sending letters to they girl, who endeavor in the world 
 And like it or not, seeks pleasures of the world 
 I'm fighting with my conscience, like rival gangs in Compton 
 'Cause I don't like a person, should I refrain or pop him? 
 I write the trifest verses, in the hood I'm like a prophet trying to fight the serpent 
 And live a thug life, I'm determined 
 To get right like Tony but I don't sniff white 
 I hit mics straight up, no cut, my flow just 
 Improving, hip-hop is in a state of disillusion 
 And I'm a infiltrate the weak 
 Like my rhyme invigorates the beat, like my nine intimidates the street 
 My mind is deeper than wounds inflicted when I blaze my heat 
 It was predicted I would come from the slums 
 And show these fake niggaz how it's done, uh... 
 (Hook x2: Dona) 
 For years niggaz glorified the ill criminal life, Personified 
 I'm just trying to do me, stay alive 
 Get money, keep my family tight 
 Legal Hustle till I die... 
 (Dona) 
 I remember rocking the same jeans for the whole weak 
 Staring at my mother, watching her drink her misery 
 Nothing for me to do, God'll see us through 
 In the ghetto everybody's not me or you 
 I'm strong minded, the rest is blinded 
 Even through the darkest nights I shine like a diamond 
 Baby's crying, dogs barking, in the background you can hear Marvin 
 Singing the blues, some fights you win or you lose 
 To tell you the truth, I ain't into losing 
 This is a ghetto reunion, all my niggaz is here 
 I swear, I wish my grandpops was here 
 To see his baby girl on top 
 In Heaven, I know you watching, the shit don't stop 
 Biggie and Pac, remember, forever 
 We all play hard together, let's get money together... 
 (Hook x4: Dona)
