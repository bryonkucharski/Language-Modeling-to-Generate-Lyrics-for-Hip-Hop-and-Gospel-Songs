(Cormega) 
 Yo, laid back like a fat buddha holding my pearl handle luger 
 In a landcruiser rims shine like daytime in Bermuda 
 I rap tight smoother than niggas who be fronting like parakeet movers 
 I had to be financially set new lex 
 In front of my duplex my shine dripping wet 
 New nine's in case your group flex 
 My brown eyes leaving your boot stretched 
 So bad you had to get a new rep vest 
 'Cause I collect stats, my advice is to accept that 
 Step back blast don't even wet that, yo 
 It's mandatory, I'm self explanatory 
 Don't front on me shorty 
 Your man's working for me 
 (Havoc Chorus) 
 Ayo we move ki's 
 Angel dust son you get touched 
 Dress up get rushed 
 Stepping up or press luck 
 Cormega coming through, duck 
 Move slowly get bucked 
 Criminal minds get stitched up 
 Down to buy your watch or bitch up 
 (Cormega) 
 Ayo this crime addict mind 
 My rhyme status shines 
 Like a nine 'matic 
 Yo I'm scarface for real I wanna die blasting fuck stashing 
 My next 50 g's I'm buying me a five wagon 
 Thugged out leather interior, mega superior 
 My art of war deaded your area 
 My mugshot praised in jail cells and drug spots 
 My razor touched faces and cut rocks 
 Corrupt cop cases had me on semi vacation 
 In state greens laid down weight schemes 
 With niggas that get paid and take cream 
 Drug supplier, thugs admire 
 Ghetto dun dun gun fire deep mind none higher 
 Your drama equalizer 
 I speak the murder Kiser Sose, no survivors 
 (Cormega) 
 Teach on threats 
 Concepts I didn't speak on yet 
 Courts feared mentally severe to the ear 
 Thug general, white lines for criminal minds to listen to 
 Chemical rhymes sparkle like a '62 
 Invinsible foulness my style is trife like Rikers Isle get 
 Queen Bridge projects is lounging on a cocaine mountain 
 Ayo Hav let the four pound spit, what!
