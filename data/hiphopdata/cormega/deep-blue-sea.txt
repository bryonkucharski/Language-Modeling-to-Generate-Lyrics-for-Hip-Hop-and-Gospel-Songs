(Feat. Jayo Felony, Kurupt) 
 (Kurupt) 
 Experiment, exercise, nigga get ya build up 
 Hardest ran, and nickel poppin' up, build up 
 Sinister sniper, I'm the venomous viper 
 Poetic riddler, Gotti ate off Hitler 
 Hood patrol, sharks up against tadpoles 
 Fire up the nickels and chrome 
 I don't fuck with y'all bitches, see I dip, deep dishes 
 International militia's melocious 
 Vicious, separate and sware you're sickening 
 I got longevity like Burn and Glickman 
 My girl bad as Kelis is, momma ring, is spread 
 The fire increases, please believe it, talent's reachin' 
 Coast to continent, you will find none greater 
 Hannibal the 8th, they call me a traitor 
 'Cause I do what the fuck I wanna do 
 Hood nigga, metropolis, gorilla, loose from the zoo motherfucker 
 (Chorus x2: Kurupt) 
 Nigga, I got beretta's, I'm hot 
 Always hot, I'mma show you niggaz how a real hood rock 
 Why, stop, givin' right by 
 Drive, nigga let me tell you 
 (Jayo Felony) 
 Emergency, get back, away, hurry, it's quick to get scary 
 Too quick to get hit with a flurry, from you, and that's on my mama 
 I'mma lay it down, until they fill it, intimidate Earl and P 
 I'mma take this shit back like Cornbread, Earl and Me 
 Ain't a bit of girl in me, see, be gitty when you get named 
 And ain't gon' come back hurt and shamed, or you'll know the'll get tamed 
 I don't play when it comes to this rappin', man, my alias is spit 
 Crossin' out and hittin' up, all over your shit 
 Which bitch wanna get hit with a tech or something 
 Actin' like y'all wreckin' something 
 On the streets, you ain't get no respect for nothing 
 Talkin' loud ain't doin' nothing 
 You want me to involve you with something? 
 Get back to it, nigga, what you doing, something 
 He fuck with me, and get clapped, you ain't nothing 
 Pullin' most, or I'm stay hustlin' 
 Please don't get up in my way cousin, all my motherfuckers buzzin' 
 Bitch ass niggaz never play the dozen 
 Nigga, don't bang it, white, cuzzin' 
 (Cormega) 
 To my thugs and g's, movin' all drugs and keys 
 Movin' lovely, now the women wanna fuck with me 
 Lovin' me, 'cause they see livin' in the bubble v 
 Livin' comfortably, young g's wanna puff with me 
 Gun at the D's, and they come for me 
 Can't get the fiends, what to me, nigga, don't fuck with me 
 My niggaz suited to mask up, act up, and we shootin' your ass up 
 Motherfucker, we, straight ass g's, takin' your keys and we 
 Movin' up faster, the bigger wanna take my enemies 
 They was fuckin' me, these motherfuckers ain't touchin' me 
 The coke man can't get enough of me 
 These to all the niggaz all trustin' me 
 This the way it gon' go down, we in rider, and we slow now 
 We the one that the women wanna know now 
 G's up, hoes down, is you ready for the show down 
 Fuck with us, so don't fuck with us, we thug niggaz and hustlers 
 Who guzzled up, separate love from lust, now niggaz ain't touchin' us 
 Streets corrupted us, y'all niggaz want fly car with the five star 
 SUV's or the side bars, nigga like me, live or die hard 
 Rather lied God, than stand scared, never could understand a man's fear 
 Cormega come through and stand clear, you busted, been touchin', nigga 
 The game all fucked up...
