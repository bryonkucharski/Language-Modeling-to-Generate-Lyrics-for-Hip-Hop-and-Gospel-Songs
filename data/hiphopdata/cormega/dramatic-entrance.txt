Yo... yo... A man is condemned or exaulted by his words... 
 Exalt me... yo... this what y'all niggas wanted... 
 The streets was waitin' 
 Here I am, a beast awakened 
 In a Beamer Station Wagon with massive gleamin' bracelets 
 After years of bein' patient 
 Sheddin' tears and beatin' cases 
 I'm ready for whatever yo (Mega!) 
 No more to say 
 Words can't explain like Rich Porters grave 
 This is a ghetto monument, my confidence is more apparent 
 The mind like a Nine automatic 
 Graceful yet capable of causin' damage 
 I'm too ill, lyrically I feel I'm too real 
 Dough or die, either way I do deals 
 I'm gifted, my only fear is death or prison 
 What other lyricist conveys such sincereness? 
 I been through the ghetto life and drug concealings 
 Fearless, and betrayal with trust is given 
 Now I deal with a few, I don't fuck with niggas 
 It's not arrogance, it's I'm-not-havin' it 
 Niggas act like they was sendin' me packages 
 When I was upstate gainin' weight and lackin' friends 
 Think about it, I don't talk about it, I be about it 
 I get money and I still be in the Projects 
 Fuck rap, nigga like me is eatin' regardless 
 Even during the drout I had a Ki in the closet 
 Connects was tellin' me I ain't need a deposit 
 They were seein' the progress on my net, smashin' niggas 
 I was pitchin', you was catchin' feelings 
 Like D's when they seen they couldn't catch my niggas 
 41st side, what, we had cracks in the building 
 The 4-5, Infra red Mac and the Sterling 
 It was all for the cause except my dogs got careless 
 I suppose those who ain't like us feared us 
 The life we chose inspired me to write these poems 
 I'm takin' mine like the Rikers phone 
 The Realness... 
 My niggas waitin' for this... pump this on the corner... 
 Pump this in ya ride... pump this in ya jail cell... 
 The essence of a hustler my nigga... what... Mega
