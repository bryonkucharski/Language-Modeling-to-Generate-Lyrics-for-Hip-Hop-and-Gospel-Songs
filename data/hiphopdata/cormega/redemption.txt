(Feat. AZ) 
 (AZ) 
 It's that shit right here 
 It's that big boy music! 
 Yahmean? 
 Thinkin' of a masterplan me and my man 
 Hand to hand on the grind since a half a gram 
 Understand even then you couldn't pass me hand 
 Was on the land all geared up and Dapper Dan 
 Around the year of them classic jams 
 I done seen niggaz get bitch slapped and ran 
 Word to yam a few got rich and swam 
 While I was sunk with they G packs trying to pump 
 It's over, no closure cars gave niggaz exposure 
 I was carried by Allah on his shoulders 
 Sober my first AR in the hood 
 Would of stuck a muhfucker and bring his truck if I could 
 Understood I was strong headed 
 But them streets and them guns gave me the wrong fetish 
 Cool whatever, I'm here we can do whatever 
 From the cars to clothes to the jewels whatever 
 Why worry? I'll rest when I'm dead and buried 
 So for now I'ma dress, get head and be merry 
 (Muthafuckers) 
 My minds still in the grind you wouldn't understand 
 It's been a long time since we was going hand to hand 
 When the block was too hot we had the look out man 
 Playing the corners to warn us soon as he saw the blue van 
 (Cormega) 
 Plans to conquer the street 
 Branded in my head like the mark of the beast 
 My knowledge so ominous I plot in my sleep 
 When I eat my niggaz eat 
 We take the bitter with the sweet 
 If I die few'll cry, less'll do a bid with me 
 Once intrigued with money and fast cars 
 Stubbornly I sold crack to my man's moms 
 Suddenly it troubles me so I asked God 
 Forgiveness for pasts wrongs and future sins 
 Presently the coop I'm in 
 View as heavenly as the roof of ?Sens? 
 Like Vince Carter I'm too intense 
 For dudes defense to stop me I abuse the rim 
 Anybody can ball I do it to win 
 Son it's +Doe or Die+, all that other shit aside 
 Any sign of betrayal my nine'll improvise 
 I spit the sickest rhymes 
 Daydream of getting mines 
 Fuck scales and just as I ?tri-beamed to digitize? 
 Pure white perrico I cooked over a greasy stove 
 From Brooklyn to Queens to O-T 
 With keys I sold in a V 
 So cold when I hit the street many people froze 
 My team deaded the block till it decomposed 
 And was under our complete control to each his own 
 I don't sleep on niggaz in the street no mo 
 'Cause when shit hit the fan even Nino told
