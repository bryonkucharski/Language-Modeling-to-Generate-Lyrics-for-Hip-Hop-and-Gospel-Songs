 My futuristic swag make these girls look dumb old 
 And I ain't even fronting ice but I'm damn cold

 I buy my own diamonds, I buy my own pearls 
 And good for nothing, corny woman make me wanna hurl 
 I like that independent woman that can handle hers 
 I'm so sick with it but they don't get it, get it 
 Forget the funny faces, I tell them run with it 
 They call me hot stuff 'cause I blaze, blaze 
 I like his eyes low off the haze, haze
