It's in my DNA-ehay-ehay-ehay (that's right) 
 So let the music play-ehay-ehay (let it, let it) 
 It's in my DNA-ehay-ehay-ehay (rock wid it) 
 I was born to shut it down 
 Rye Rye 
 Eh, It's natural 
 I don't need no Adderall 
 And just let the beat bump 
 And Imma make yo bodies jump 
 All my chickas reports to the dance floor 
 Or, better yet, sweat our your dance pores 
 Pull out cho weaves 
 Done for 
 These niggas run the world, I rep fo um 
 We get stupid, we get dumb 
 Party all night 
 Till we numb 
 I got shades on, forget a hater 
 And don't be throwing no ass in tha ...? 
 That's right, that's right 
 We can keep these niggas till they turn on the lights 
 Let's go, Let's go 
 Cause a party ain't a party till you put on a show 
 Natural killah-killah 
 Now my body move realer-realer 
 Up in the club, screamin' we don't give a fuck 
 ...?

 This is a party anthem 
 Hand in tha air 
 You can talk that shit 
 But truly, we don't really care 
 And tonight, you came to party 
 Hands in tha air 
 And you're feelin' yourself getting zoned out 
 Say hell yeah 
 I said, put me on the dance floor 
 And you can catch me freakin' on a bad boy 
 Workin' my body-yoddie-ah 
 And I'm feeling so naughty-oddie-oddia-ah 
 Now when the DJ spin that record 
 We be goin' reckless 
 We be throwin' shades, party rockin', and two-steppin'
