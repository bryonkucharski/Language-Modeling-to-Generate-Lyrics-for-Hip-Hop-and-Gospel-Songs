Get ready, get, get, get ready 
 Get, get ready, get, get, get ready 
 See I've been in it for a minute 
 Holding my spot down 
 I ain't seein' no shit that could move a crowd 
 I ain't seein' no shit that moves likes this 
 I ain't seein' no shit comin' on like this 
 'Cause I'm a rider 
 And everything I just turn cut 
 I came to school, you dizzy ducks 
 Like the games, I'm fun, I'm too cool for my own shit 
 Swag's outrageous, my style's retarded, I'm so contagious 
 Holla, holla, come on, let the drum play 
 Holla, holla, come on, let the drum play 
 Actin' dumpy on the table top, let the drum play 
 Actin' dumpy on the table top, let the drum play 
 Holla, holla, come on, let the drum play 
 Holla, holla, come on, let the drum play 
 Actin' dumpy on the table top, let the drum play 
 Actin' dumpy on the table top, let the drum play 
 See I've been down for a minute but I'm right on time 
 It's gonna take two of me just to steal my shine 
 Check the streets and my stats if you think I'm lyin' 
 And with a body like this you can sway, I'm wrong 'cause I'm erotic 
 And everything I just turn cut 
 I came to school you dizzy ducks 
 Like the games, I'm fun, I'm too cool for my own shit 
 Swag's outrageous, my style's retarded, I'm so contagious 
 Holla, holla, come on let the drum play 
 Holla, holla, come on let the drum play 
 Actin' dumpy on the table top, let the drum play 
 Actin' dumpy on the table top, let the drum play 
 Holla, holla, come on, let the drum play 
 Holla, holla, come on, let the drum play 
 Actin' dumpy on the table top, let the drum play 
 Actin' dumpy on the table top, let the drum play 
 Get, get ready, get, get, get ready 
 Get, get ready, get, get, get ready 
 Get, get ready, get, get, get ready 
 Get, get ready, get, get, get ready 
 Get, get ready, get, get, get ready 
 Get, get ready, get, get, get ready 
 Get, get ready, get, get, get ready 
 Get, get ready, get, get, get ready 
 Holla, holla, come on, let the drum play 
 Holla, holla, come on, let the drum play 
 Actin' dumpy on the table top, let the drum play 
 Actin' dumpy on the table top, let the drum play 
 Holla, holla, come on, let the drum play 
 Holla, holla, come on, let the drum play 
 Actin' dumpy on the table top, let the drum play 
 Actin' dumpy on the table top, let the drum play
