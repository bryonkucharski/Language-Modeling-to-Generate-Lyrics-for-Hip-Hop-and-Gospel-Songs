Sunshine it's a friend of mine, 
 At the school line, checkin' all the boys who were fine, 
 We were in line when we got the first sign, 
 The boy she liked checkin' out was mine.

 And this time I'm flamed, 
 Cold blooded in this, yeah you know my name, 
 Home girl I'm doing my thing, 
 Put it down and in the real that's just my game, 
 No hoes they Ain't the same, 
 Start feeling their stuff start acting up, 
 Some thought (our ass?) start back it up, 
 Tell my homies on the track lets wrap it up, 
 But, we go ghost riding, 
 Got the pumps in the back, 
 Let a hoe keep hiding, 
 We jump beside it, 
 Stomp the yard, to the club, on the floor we sliding, 
 Pop a juice when they see me shine, 
 Fellows take my coat hang it on the rec line, 
 Now its time and we proceed, 
 Come get with me if you know my seat.

 Hot girls keep looking, 
 Post it up throwing up so mad 'cause I'm looking, 
 I can get yo man and his friend too, 
 All I do is crack a smile when they fall through, 
 I'm so bad and they so not, 
 Turning my back tell 'em go kick rocks, 
 He said, she said, they said, ah 
 When I say, you say, we all say, ah 
 I don't take home losers, 
 You come through my hood ya right after school ya, 
 Got my right hand girl on one side, 
 The left side make sure you up high, 
 Ain't my fault got my girls on my side, 
 We stay calm, fuck girls gone wild, 
 And you know we hit the chop beat up? 
 Man I told you once, yo that's what's up.
