(Rye Rye:) 
 So, I was sitting outside one day 
 Waiting for the dude to come down my way, 
 Praying, wishing, hoping, thinking, 
 And I felt my emotions sinking. 
 I've been waiting for the phone to ring, 
 I check constantly, but it was all a dream 
 I never thought you could be so mean! 
 Tired of the waiting, so it's time to come clean 
 And why do boys have to be so shady? 
 First it's all good and he's glad you his lady 
 Baby this, baby that, see another chick and he act like that. 
 But the thing with me, I can't take it, 
 Kept it 100, was real, now face it! 
 You gonna eat your words and Imma make you happen 
 So, we're ready for the action. 
 Chorus: [Robyn] 
 'Cause you never were, and you never will be mine! 
 That's right, that's right, that's right! 
 No you never were and you never will be mine! 
 That's right, that's right, that's right! 
 There's a moment to seize every time that we meet, 
 But you always keep passing me by. 
 No, you never were, and you never will be mine! 
 (Rye Rye:) 
 Yo, Yo, Yo 
 If you havin' problems with the one you love so much 
 And you wanna feel his touch, 
 Put your hand in the air, let them know that you truly care 
 You don't wanna do the fight fuss, 
 Getting sick of the love pain, 
 All the lies and the trust games, 
 Guessing, age don't make a difference, 
 And I'm getting fed up, so listen! 
 First you told me that you loved me dearly, 
 I loved you, did I make that clearly? 
 And you're thinking that you can play my game, 
 But I wanna think twice, so retain my claim 
 And I'm kinda mad at myself, 'cause I let you get the best of me, 
 To confess to me, her 
 Oh boy, I'm through! 
 Tell that chick that she better get at you 
 Chorus: [Robyn] 
 'Cause you never were, and you never will be mine! 
 That's right, that's right, that's right! 
 No you never were and you never will be mine! 
 That's right, that's right, that's right! 
 There's a moment to seize every time that we meet, 
 But you always keep passing me by. 
 No, you never were, and you never will be mine! 
 Rye rye: 
 Question: what happened to forever? 
 Me and you always together! 
 Too bad I was too much clever, can't be played a fool 
 That's never. 
 Suppose she made you happy or whatever 
 Learn from the past, proceed, get better 
 Good girl gone mad 
 Guess you didn't realize just what you had 
 Chorus: [Robyn] (x2) 
 'Cause you never were, and you never will be mine! 
 That's right, that's right, that's right! 
 No you never were and you never will be mine! 
 That's right, that's right, that's right! 
 There's a moment to seize every time that we meet, 
 But you always keep passing me by. 
 No, you never were, and you never will be mine
