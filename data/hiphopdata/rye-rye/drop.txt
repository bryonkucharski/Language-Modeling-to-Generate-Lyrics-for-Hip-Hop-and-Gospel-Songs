I drop to the floor, it's nothing, drop to the floor, it's nothing 
 It's scraping on the floor, it's scraping on the floor 
 Back it, back it up and gimme some more 
 It's in the, I, I bring it down low and get low, with it 
 Low with it, I'm seeing you go with it 
 Get up, go, get it, move your body real slow with it 
 Get up, slow with it, I'm seein' at, go with it 
 Get up, go, get it 
 I wanna get it good, when I fly a boy chillin' over there 
 I wonder if he noticed that I want him over here 
 I see him watch them hers, I show mine's every year 
 I dropped it down low, I put my booty in the air 
 And I'm a rockstar so you know I don't care 
 Till I fly your shit, when I fly your hair 
 And I'm so sick of the aerish chair 
 I'm a hot girl, don't white girl share 
 I drop to the floor, it's nothing, I drop to the floor, it's nothing 
 It's scraping on the floor, it's scraping on the floor 
 Back it, back it up and gimme some more 
 As in, I, I bring it down low and get low, with it 
 Low, with it, I'm seeing you go with it 
 Get up, go, get it, move your body real slow with it 
 Get up, slow with it, I'm seein' at, go with it 
 Get up, go, get it 
 And I hope I got time to be joking 
 Boys in the back must smoking 
 It's in the this holla, on the dance floor roastin' 
 And fake cheeks and my face keep pelsing 
 I'm lookin' at him real smooth like cool 
 And he lookin' at me like, "Girl, how you do this? " 
 I brought my hips real slow, we can do it 
 It's getting rough girl, go music 
 I drop to the floor, it's nothing, drop to the floor, it's nothing 
 It's scraping on the floor, it's scraping on the floor 
 Back it, back it up and gimme some more 
 As in, I, I bring it down low and get low with it 
 Low with it I'm seeing you go with it 
 Get up, go, get it, move your body real slow with it 
 Get up, slow with it, I'm seein' at, go get it 
 Get up, go, get it 
 Move your body to the bass line 
 Dude, now you got your hands on my waist line 
 Hurry up, I don't waste time 
 You rude boy, I had it to the great fine 
 You talking real slick, I like that 
 You blowing kiss kiss, blow right back 
 You can call me candy girl 'cause I'm so sweet 
 You can see the way I work so you know I'm not weak 
 I drop to the floor, it's nothing, drop to the floor, it's nothing 
 You can call me candy girl 'cause I'm so sweet 
 You can call me candy girl 'cause I'm so sweet 
 Drop the eight away, so you know I'm goin' free 
 Drop the eight away, so you know I'm goin' free 
 You can call me candy girl 'cause I'm so sweet 
 You can call me candy girl 'cause I'm so sweet 
 Drop the eight away, so you know I'm goin' free 
 Drop the eight away, so you know I'm goin' free
