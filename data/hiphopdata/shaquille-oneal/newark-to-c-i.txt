(Shaq) 
 Before anyone gets upset 
 We're only sayin' funkin' 
 F u n k I n 
 Ah ha ha ha 
 Ah ha ha ha 
 Ha ha ha ha 
 That's right boy 
 George The King Village 
 Watch this seven footer spit rhymes like a loogie 
 Funked up like some doogie warrior just like sazuki 
 Ah Twism man of steel organism 
 Combined with phat rhymes comin' from my wall prism 
 In my league hoopers don't act their age 
 You might be another dead boy front page 
 I make more cash than the president 
 Find a bigger residence 
 Shaq is the man and that's evident 
 Irelevent, what them critics say 
 Until they come rhyme, come act, come play 
 Get out me way 
 Or come trip into this rhyme funk 
 I'm nut-rageous, outrageous, like the Buddha monk 
 It's about where you're from not where you went 
 Newark, New Jersey, represent, represent 
 To the fullest, you messin' round, you's a dead man 
 Prepare for the Redman 
 (Keith Murray) 
 Oh yo yo yo, hold up 
 Due to certain circumstances, Redman will not be performing tonight 
 But we got Keith Murray from the Def Squad up in here 
 So, you know what I'm sayin', check it out 
 Never question who I am, black 
 I slam jams with Redman, Erick Sermon, and the Shaq 
 I wreck this with wreckless emotionless 
 Above any beyond the depths of physics 
 With bio feed back techniques 
 I speak over the beat 
 So peep a true thug from the streets 
 Of New York 
 Where you get outlined in chalk 
 And the herbest person gets foul like pork 
 You walk and talk into tripizoid 
 Boy I can flipizoid, trapizoid on record 
 All these MCs out here is a big dissapointment 
 So I refuse to lose and ooze like ointment 
 Into a deconcentration 
 I scrape you and your scab-ass crew up like vaxitration 
 And if you're 6-9, 280, tryin' to get ill 
 I'll have my man Shaquille O'Neal push your grill 
 And that's real 
 (Shaq) 
 Some choose to pack a mack, I choose to pack my Shaq 
 Twenty twos 
 I wonder how you'd act if you was in my shoes 
 This is how I take the old from the new 
 All my nines down the line kick and lead it too 
 Rugged never smooth with this move as I flow 
 On and on this track, my papes stacked in the back 
 Step up to get funk in your face 
 '88 was Runs house, but '95 is Shaqs place 
 Cracked up like Boogie, from New Jack City 
 High with the clowns, but down with the nitty gritty 
 Fool, child, with the high profile 
 Style kind of hoop-hoppa-listic wild 
 Come, get some 
 From the one that freaks the fees, the foes, the fies, the fums 
 I flip my style like a pancake flipper 
 Dive-dive dipper 
 Let me pull up my zipper 
 I'm sick and tired of pissin' on this track 
 Newark represnts lovely 
 Redman and the Shaq 
 For the '96, '97 
 Jersey is representin' 
 Always and fo'ever 
 Fo'ever and always 
 Prince Street, where ya at 
 George The King Village, where ya at 
 Naughtyville, where ya at 
 Can't forget the brothers in Chilltown, J.C. 
 Oakstreet representin' 
 Ha ha, and I'm out
