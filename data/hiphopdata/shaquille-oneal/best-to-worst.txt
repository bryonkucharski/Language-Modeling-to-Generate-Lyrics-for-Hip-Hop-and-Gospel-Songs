Chorus: Peter Gunz 
 I'm sending rappers to heaven 
 So call me uplifting 
 I greet ya defeat ya 
 Take all your recognition 
 Be in the ignition first gear 
 I'm gone 
 Had the best to the worst confess my lyrics is strong 
 Verse 1: Shaq, Peter Gunz 
 I was born to raise hell and cause havoc when I enter 
 Have the pin back hands up white flag surrender 
 What I'm into pulling stocks and bonds and cheddar 
 Gauaranteeing the world you can't find nothin' better 
 So whatever 
 Bring it the front and put your money by your mouth 
 Find your teeth and cash coming out 
 I bring drama to your momma if she want it 
 You think I'm fronitin' a fruad 
 Peter tell 'em how I want it 
 Aiyo Shaq the world is yours 
 But can I get a city 
 Gritty blocks shitty cops 
 Broads with tingo bittys 
 Hit 50 in the ruckus mutha 
 Is I happy 
 You callin me fraud but your broad's calling me daddy 
 While you pumpin dollar bottles on the floor looking funny 
 I'm going drop hits with Shaq kid 
 And dirt getting money 
 Sunney days is made the pain it rains no more 
 The cash will last from now the guns hits the floor 
 Verse 2: Shaq 
 Check it 
 Enrico dope like perscriptions from pharmacys 
 Injecting through speakers with no limit slash no mercy 
 The ill beat seaker 
 I mystify minds like I'm a preacher 
 When I meet ya start convulsing like a seizure 
 You best believe I got more tricks up my shirt sleeve 
 Expidisouly I get loose like hair weave 
 Which MC out there wanna come test me 
 Put footprints in your chest like Kareem did me 
 I run rhymes like drunk drivers on stop signs 
 I change my name to Deon 'cause I'm mutha freaking prime time 
 Verse 3: Peter Gunz 
 Out the alleys of the ghetto there echos a voice sweeter 
 The melon a felon under the first name Peter 
 Looking out the hour glass what do I see 
 Guliani with tacky at me with death penalty 
 I dodge the cops bob and weave to the left 
 Young gifted and black but yet I'm still marked for death 
 My breath and oxygen is limited 
 They did me in with it 
 They took my lungs my heart they kept my brain and headed with it 
 I live alive to see my seed breath airs 
 In and exhale but please breath clean air 
 Runnin' 'round killin' people with sex you flex 
 Spread in the bed ask me dread who's next
