 I wanna girl like my dear yeah 
 {Tall, slender, brown eyes with the legit like this} 
 (Verse One: Shaq) 
 I wanna girl like my dear, that's my mom dukes 
 Someone to kick back with no fake no juice 
 Beautiful cars cool collective 
 Settle down chill out that's my objective check it 
 My game put my on the map at first base 
 Make up like cake in your face just ain't my taste 
 Some girls try to play me but yo I find another 
 Because I gots that crazy game and I'll make like my mother 
 ???? Speakin' I'm like I'm tweekin 
 My business never leak in the street 
 The packin is so complete, like 7-up I never had it but maybe I will 
 In need a women that reminds me of Lucille, my dear yeah 
 (Verse Two: Shaq) 
 Let's get it on I've been feeling down 
 Baby know maybe you can help me out

 Let the good times roll in the heat ofthe night 
 I'm supafly TNT Shaquille O'Neal 
 Reach out for me I'll be there you know the deal 
 Now ain't that peculair I found a wonder full one 
 Ain't nothing like the ral thing buggin out having fun 
 A man will always be a man he sippin on ??? I understand 
 So let me stick to drinkin' up these Pepsi joints 
 Dunkin, actin' and rackin up these points 
 I look over I see you in the stands 
 I'm showing off actin' a fool for you and my fans 
 I put my peace sign high up in the air 
 I think I found a girl just like my dear yeah 
 (Verse Three: Warren G) 
 Ah a brand new verse to smoke as I'm ??? all the way 
 'Cause this DJ is kickin up dust from the urban Eastside 
 Twenty-First street and Louis that's where my funk ride 
 Chillin' with my man Shaq Diesel, cock diesel 
 Yes it's me Warren jiggy jiggy G'z 
 So G-funk, we funk till the end of our lives 
 With respect for our mamas Miss Dee is right 
 (Verse Four: Shaq) 
 I'm glad I found that significant other 
 She remind me of my mother 'cause yo there ain't no other 
 I treat her right like father MC 
 'Cause I check Ralph Tresvant for "Sensitivity" 
 Behind every great man is a great woman 
 I keep it commin baby baby I keep it comin' 
 And you don't have to worry about a thang 
 'Cause living in the fast lane just ain't my thang 
 Peace to Lucille and Miss Ola May 
 'Cause women of today like to play what can I say 
 I'm glad I found me a girl that's real 
 She reminds me of my number one baby Lucille yeah 
 (Chorus till fade)
