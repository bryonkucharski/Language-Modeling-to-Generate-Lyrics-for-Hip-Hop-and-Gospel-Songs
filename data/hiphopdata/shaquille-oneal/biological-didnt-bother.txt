Yo, yo, I want to dedicated this song to Philip Arthur Harrison 
 Word up, 'cause he was the one who took me from a boy to a man 
 So as far as I'm concerned, he's my father 
 'Cause my biological didn't bother 
 Biological father, left me in the cold, when a few months old 
 Aa father's child was greater than gold but I guess not 
 You brought me into the world but you're not my dad 
 Mess around with those drugs makes my moms mad 
 So we left you with no remorsal pity, took the first bus 
 From York to Jersey City, women and child alone 
 Noww that's pressure, mom's got to go to work, drop me off 
 By Obesa momma, aunt DeDe, whoever aunt Falma, uncle Roy 
 We stuck together, a year went by and I could walk y'all 
 Moms got that good ol' job at city hall 
 She probably didn't trust men anymore 
 Until Philip Harrison walk though the door 
 Went out a few times but what about Shaquille 
 Mom's offered him a million dollar package deal 
 She said, "You want me, you gotta take my son" 
 Or else it's like a hot dog but without the bun 
 Guess what he accepted, responsibility he never left it 
 He kept it, he kept it he took me from a boy to a man 
 So Phil is my father, 'cause my biological didn't bother 
 He took me from a boy to a man 
 So Phil is my father 'cause my biological didn't bother 
 He took me from a boy to a man 
 So Phil is my father 'cause my biological didn't bother 
 He took me from a boy to a man 
 So Phil is my father 'cause my biological didn't bother 
 He took me from a boy to a man 
 So Phil is my father 'cause my biological didn't bother 
 January fifth, Phil made a promise, what's that? 
 He joined the army, we moved to Fort Mamth 
 He disciplined me right from the get go 
 Age two bottle and my mom shaquille let go 
 Actin' spoiled, rotten, trippin' 
 Got a butt whippin' because I didn't listen 
 Back then you see privates made no bucks 
 Had to get another job driven trucks 
 Workin' hard as hell didn't satisfy him 
 Had to another job working at the gym 
 He wasn't gone with the wind like Clark Gable 
 Work all them jobs to put food on the table 
 Phil's my father, daddy and that's the scoop 
 Can I go to the gym with you and shoot some hoops 
 Come on he, put me under his wing 
 Was the ball boy for his little Arthur team 
 Sometimes he even made me mad but it didn't matter 
 'Cause I still wanted to be like dad but a little bit better 
 Encouraged me to stay in school and to get then good letters 
 I wasn't a brainiac but I tried hard 
 Got to watch the knicks, play if I had a good report card 
 All types, all sorts, disobeyed my dad and I couldn't play sports 
 I learned to dribble from right to left, I couldn't do a damn thang 
 With all them F's, age fifteen father and son confrontation 
 That's nothin' but father and son trials and tribulation 
 Back then I could understand but I'm glad you did it 
 'Cause now I'm a man, he took me from a boy to a man 
 So Phil is my father 'cause my biological didn't bother 
 He took me from a boy to a man 
 So Phil is my father 'cause my biological didn't bother 
 Look at me now successful for sure 
 Phil raised me well to be an entrepreneur 
 And if your making big dope be materialistic 
 'Cause you'll end up another statistic 
 Everything's going well following my dreams 
 I dunked on Patrick Ewing, I won the ring like Hakeem 
 Oh, what do you know? Biological one's on the Ricky Lake show 
 What does he want, does he want money? What people do for money 
 It's kinda funny to me, he ain't gettin' no check from me, check it 
 He can go on all the talk shows he want phil is my dad 
 So don't even front, he took me from a boy to a man 
 So Phil is my father 'cause my biological didn't bother 
 He took me from a boy to a man 
 So Phil is my father 'cause my biological didn't bother
