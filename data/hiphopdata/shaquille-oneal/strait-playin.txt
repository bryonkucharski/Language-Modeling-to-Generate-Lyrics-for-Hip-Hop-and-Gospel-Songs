It's hard being this good 
 Yeah 
 Uh 
 Yeah 
 I took a stand in the 90's 
 Shook but heard turnin' it 
 The fact that Shaq could leave a cold track burnin 
 Even though in the Tahoe 
 My whole crew could follow 
 I convoy 100,000 dollar car follow 
 Keep your eyes on the biggest big man in the era 
 Represent rap for all 
 Enrico Gates bring the terror 
 T, W, I s to the M The World Is Mine 
 I'm gonna shout till a thousand 99 
 I'm dope for breakin backboards easy 
 Even caught bills slippin 
 Like they greasy 
 Pockets stay cheesy 
 Believe me 
 I can stack your chips on the remix 
 And you still couldn't see me 
 Now pay me 
 Run to the border 
 Hit the water 
 Cause your style and your profile is out of order 
 I flow like a river 
 None come bigger 
 It's a fact big Shaq is just one bad 
 I like playin' on the west side 
 Even though I miss playin' on the east side 
 My girl Michelle still got my back and its all right 
 We could do it from the night until the daylight 
 **I got suckers from my past tryin' to feel me 
 And all the ones gettin' fresh tryin' to kill me 
 A force goes through her body that could chill me** 
 There's nothing left for you to do but try to feel me 
 We can cut through the red tape 
 And bust through the fakers 
 Keep your eye on big Shaq 
 And put your money on the Lakers 
 I'm guaranteed 
 (You'll do what?) 
 I repeat I'm guaranteed 
 To bring it to your face indeed 
 Type of brother who can stay up all night and hit 40 
 After the game get naughty 
 And pull your shorty 
 And its hard to the next stage to bring it to your idol 
 Bring it to your whole team and bring home the title 
 Let my crew known for how we do when we travel 
 Let's straddle leavin' folks grounded like gravel 
 Saddle up your horse and hit the course 
 It's your turn 
 You could stay in my face and watch your whole crew burn 
 Now some say I 
 Don't shine I 
 Know a different story, never lie 
 Come watch me fly the sky's no limit 
 And Shaq's no gimmick you can mimmick 
 But you front and your finished 
 I like playin' on the west side 
 Even though I miss playin' on the east side 
 My girl Michelle still got my back and its all right 
 We could do it from the night until the daylight 
 **I got suckers from my past tryin' to feel me 
 And all the ones gettin' fresh tryin' to kill me 
 A force goes through her body that chill me** 
 There's nothing left for you to do but try to feel me 
 Now peace to the playa haters that hate me playin' 
 Knock what I do knock what I'm sayin' 
 I'm pullin out the red carpet and your inside it 
 Bring it to the front and light it and get excited 
 Trauma my good fellow mellow like a cello 
 Enrico Gonzalez one rich fellow 
 And watch me make your girl jiggle like jell-o 
 Whose world is this? 
 Over here baby hello 
 I like playin' on the west side 
 Even though I miss playin' on the east side 
 My girl Michelle still got my back and its all right 
 We could do it from the night until the daylight 
 **I got suckers from my past tryin' to feel me 
 And all the ones gettin' fresh tryin' to kill me 
 A force goes through her body that could chill me** 
 There's nothing left for you to do but try to feel me 
 I like playin' on the west side 
 Even though I miss playin' on the east side 
 My girl Michelle still got my back and its all right 
 We could do it from the night until the daylight 
 **I got suckers from my past tryin' to feel me 
 And all the ones gettin' fresh tryin' to kill me 
 A force goes through her body that could chill me** 
 There's nothing left for you to do but try to feel me 
 Rock on baby 
 Rock on baby 
 Oh yeah 
 Rock on and on 
 Oh yeah 
 I love Superman 
 I love Superman 
 I love Superman 
 I love Superman 
 I love the Westside, it's time to party 
 Whenever Superman is in the house 
 I love the Eastside, it's time to party 
 Whenever Superman is in the house 
 (Music repeats until end)
