(Ice Cube) 
 I'm sick wit' it but it'll still take ten of why'all 
 To take the Emperor's temperature 
 Can I represent wit' ya? 
 Smokin' hemp wit' ya 
 Pass the blunt from East to West 
 [Cube to KRS] (yes) 
 Take it from the Don 
 Where I'm from the Man of Steel is made of Teflon 
 Keep yo' vest on 
 Hit me with yo' best one baby 
 And watch me mack you 
 Comin' through with hard *** & Shaq-Fu 
 Never up in Spago's when we knock hoes 
 Head her off with some Reeboks and cagos 
 Westside rollin' even if the car's stolen 
 Even if my eyes shut and jaw swollen 
 That's how it's goin' down 
 You always smile when I frown 
 'Cause you want the crown 
 You fuckin' clown 
 I keep it real no more beef with Cypress Hill 
 Now we super friends makin' super ends 
 Westsiide 
 (Shaq) 
 It's a fact many know that Shaq made of mils 
 But did you know that Shaq made of Steel 
 Feel me! 
 No matter what I do the billy it's gone flourish 
 Big **** just like a bus full of Japanese tourists 
 Or it's styles that flow like Hudson River debris 
 Ship quarter keys of them Shaq CD's Roo roo 
 Next MC that claim to keep it real 
 Shaquille gone slap 'em with a mil 
 Criss cut clean numerical order bills 
 Ill, now put it on the wrist 
 The best thing since grits and fake tits 
 Man Of Steel who you with? 
 I'm so fly when I walk I levitate 
 My caliber's first rate 
 Exceptional above great 
 Diesel's large, guilty on every charge 
 Of bein' dope imagine Superman with a dookey rope 
 1 2 3 4 Hit it 
 It's the Men Of Steel bangin' with the drum Hit it 
 4 3 2 1 
 Shaq be Real KRS Peter Gunz (Ice Cube) 
 1 2 3 4 Hit it 
 It's the Men Of Steel bangin' with the drum Hit it 
 4 3 2 1 
 Shaq be Real 
 (Be Real) 
 Hip hop has plenty of Steel 
 With Shaquille and Chris and Real 
 Nobody move stay still while the Masters build the Track 
 React the foundation hip-hop *** generation 
 Hear my voice playin' at the station 
 Immortal thought for the recorder 
 Consider the picture deliver the scripture still hit ya 
 If the shoe fits ya wear it 
 You'll inherit the culture 
 Let me break down the whole structure 
 East Coast West Coast universal flava 
 Pullin' together with my neighbor no playa haters 
 Just real no outrageous fantasies 
 Jump out the pages from the book of MC's 
 And nothin' can penetrate the Steel mind state 
 Like Shaq when he go back and dominate 
 (Peter Gunz) 
 Aiiyo I stop many hearts 
 Part many wigs 
 *** & get it twisted & 
 Play me for any pig 
 Conceived in the Bronx 
 Born and raised but on the real 
 I be made of Steel like O' Neal 
 Feel me if ya got the skill 
 Squeeze pale **** cause disaster 
 Have you makin' Tracks like Master 
 Faster ghost like Casper 
 Man Of Steel hangin' and bangin' in yo' district 
 Never get it twisted I'm lifted, gifted 
 Like Steel hard to penetrate 
 Generate dollar signs you follow mine 
 Come in peace money I will bless that 
 Bring the noise leave you on the Fourth 
 Where I rest at For real 
 1 2 3 4 Hit it 
 It's the Men Of Steel bangin' with the drum Hit it 
 4 3 2 1 
 Hip-Hop's the same no matter where you came from

 (KRS-One) 
 Whoop whoop 
 That's the sound of EMS 
 After some boy try test the KRS 
 Pick a single any single 
 What I bring you makes you tingle 
 It's the lingo from the star like Ringo 
 And I mingle in the clubs 
 DJ's MC's get rug cut like shrubs 
 Over the dub sound buzz 
 No one's really knowin' 
 How I'm comin' and goin' showin' and flowin' cold 
 Throwin' these rappers chasin' the dough 
 And out the frame my name remains the same 
 I came to maintain 
 Hip-Hop's the same no matter where you came from 
 It's all the same son get it correct 
 All that metal to pleather whatever 
 Give me respect! 
 Then I'll collect a check and you can expect 
 Something you'll never forget 
 Comin' from my intellect 
 Oh what the heck 
 Lyrical flex cash checks 
 I step through the brush like a Tyrannosaurus Rex 
 KRS-One is the nicest 
 Shaquille O'Neal definitely from Men Of Steel 
 You know how we feel 
 Comin' through like that on the track 
 KRS-One and we back (ooh ooh) 
 1 2 3 4 Hit it 
 It's the Men Of Steel bangin' with the drum Hit it
