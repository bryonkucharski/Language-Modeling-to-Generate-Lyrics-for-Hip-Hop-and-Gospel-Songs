Shaq 
 Yo yo (yo yo) 
 I don't really wanna play the game (nah) 
 But if you want me to play the game, and wait a while 
 I will 
 Ha ha ha 
 S.H.E. 
 Let's wait a while 
 Before it gets too late 
 Let's wait 
 Let's wait a while 
 Before it gets too late 
 Let's wait 
 Shaq 
 Yo, the first time I met you it was love on sight 
 No matter what I do I can't forget that night 
 In my mind you was fine as wine, air tight 
 Somethin' like a movie, but this is real life 
 No mistaken, unh, I was taken 
 Girl you hit me harder than the music I be makin' 
 I exercise, push-ups, how you feel huh? 
 What's your name girl? how can I get wit' ya? 
 I can't believe that she didn't heed that 
 No type of feed back, I need to pull my sleeves back 
 And try again, time after time 
 But I won't stop until I make the girl mine 
 S.H.E. 
 Let's wait a while 
 Before it gets too late 
 Let's wait 
 Let's wait a while 
 Before it gets too late 
 Let's wait 
 Shaq 
 I got the digits, unh, remember I was 
 On the telephone kickin' willy bone for hours 
 Buyin' candy and flowers, often 
 I can't count amounts but I know I spend a fortune 
 I never sweat it, you was so cute 
 That I ran like Pacman in hot pursuit (back back back) 
 All my friends say you must be buggin' kid 
 You say I'm just a friend to make me feel like this 
 But I would never do you like the next guy did 
 Scared to love again and keepin' your heart hid 
 And just when I think you might come around soon 
 You proceed to hit me wit' that wait a while tune 
 S.H.E. 
 Let's wait a while 
 Before it gets too late 
 Let's wait 
 Let's wait a while 
 Before it gets too late 
 Let's wait 
 Shaq 
 Vision of love, the one I think of 
 If I had my way we'd be tighter than a glove 
 On the scale of one to ten you must be an eleven 
 Baby hold my hand and walk the highway to heaven 
 I'm not the same old thing runnin' the game type 
 Love 'em and leave 'em alone, catch the next flight 
 I promise you, I'm a stay true 
 If you call my name I'll come to the rescue 
 I mean a queen like you deserves honor 
 Scoop you in a drop-top Porchse, my tire's armored 
 For worse or better, no matter what the weather 
 It don't really matter, we still down together 
 I got your back, in fact, I'll never hurt you 
 Mislead, deceive, Shaq won't desert you 
 Just call me crazy, I just say whatever 
 Prayin' for the day I'll make you my girl forever 
 S.H.E. 
 Let's wait a while 
 Before it gets too late 
 Let's wait 
 Let's wait a while 
 Before it gets too late 
 Let's wait
