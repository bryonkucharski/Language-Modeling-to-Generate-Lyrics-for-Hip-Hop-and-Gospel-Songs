Intro: Shaq 
 Yo yo 
 This jam right here dedicated to all the little bad knuckleheads runnin' 
 Around 
 Gettin' in trouble 
 Just follow your dreams and you'll be aight 
 Chorus: Peter Gunz 
 Yo it was all a dream 
 Deprising and uprising my schemes 
 But surprising realzing that 
 Yo it was all a dream 
 I kept my head above the water for cream 
 But now I'm turnin' all heads when I step on the scene 
 (Yesterday it was just a dream 
 Never thought this could ever happen to me) 
 It was all a dream 
 (How a change came around in my life) 
 Verse 1: Shaq 
 I went back and forth from ??? to chilltown JC 
 At first it's just me and mommy 
 Then Phil came along, he bought a basketball go to the park 
 Get your game on Shaq but have your butt back by dark 
 I was acting like the doc, my game was the joint 
 Dribbilin' between my legs like Norm Nixon at the point 
 Materalism kept them other kids biz'm 
 While I was selling my game they was sellin' izm 
 Words by Phil be a leader not a follwa 
 Don't let the masses of technology swallow ya 
 La-d da-d we all likes to party 
 I'm followin' my dreams I'm gonna be somebody 
 Verse 2: Shaq 
 Now check it, commodores was my favorite joint 
 Till I heard Planet Rock on the bop, that jam's on point 
 I used to rhyme in the mirrior, like I was down with UTFO 
 Doug E. Fresh singin' a show 
 For a big kid I had crazy rhythm 
 Size 13 suede crews with thick shoe strings in 'em 
 I was the baddest popa, baddest rhyme dropper 
 Bustin' more mills than Superman to helicopters 
 I had the name buckle kids used to jock 
 Public Enemy came out, I had the clock 
 My favorite jam was by Big Daddy ain't no half steppa 
 My mic sounds nice check 1-2 by Salt N' Pepa 
 Heavy D, Rakim, Eric B, Ricky D 
 Scott LaRock and BDP 
 I never knew 'em but I used to look up to 'em 
 Battles in the park in the dark I ran through 'em 
 Verse 3: Shaq 
 Somebody wake me up this can't be real 
 Lookin' in the paper, Shaq's about to make a hundred mil 
 Somebody smack me, it's gotta be fake 
 20,000 square foot crib on the back of a lake 
 Five movie deal with Disney 
 Damn I'm getting busy like Dizzy Calepsi 
 20 mil check from Pepsi 
 Let's see, red benz and black porsche 
 ??? Room suburban with roof-top hole and of course 
 Boat with my name on the side so I can ride on the water 
 With my wife and my baby daughter 
 I oughta write a book so y'all can see 
 How easy it is to be who the hell you wanna be 
 This is a message from Shaq, react bring it on back 
 Follow your dreams and it's like that
