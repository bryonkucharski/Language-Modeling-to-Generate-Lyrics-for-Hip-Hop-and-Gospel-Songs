Al set it off! 
 Hey yo, Ill you set it off! 
 Hey yo, Shaq set it off! 
 Hey yo Al, you set it off! 
 Hey yo Shaq, you set it off! 
 Hey yo, Ill, you set it off! 
 Eh yo, Shaq set it off! 
 Al, set it off: 
 Well, it's the mister nasty that's beyond match 
 Come around my way AK.A. Al Skratch 
 Hey yo, gimme mic check... 
 Nah hold up black, gimme that mic check 
 1-2 it's the Shaq 
 Hey yo, who!? 
 Shaquille! Ooh you know my style 
 I'm a' rhyme my way with big 
 Eh-ooh-la-isle? 
 Tall, schizophrenic- don't act dumb 
 Hey yo gimme mic check 1-2 I wanna get some 
 Big Ill, the bomb in the boondocks 
 Reporter 
 The border you flexin' in my section 
 Manslaughter 
 Pop in the tape, pump up the transistor 
 Mister, mister brassly (?) 
 A to the L 
 Finger to the trigger to the shell 
 As I open up the frequency 
 Come on and creep with me 
 I'll let you in on a secret, G 
 When I grab the microphone yo kid, I don't joke 
 Now cheer when I slam the jam 
 The Shh was dope 
 Mic check 1-2, 1-2, mic check 
 Mic check 1-2, 1-2, mic check 
 Mic check 1-2, 1-2, mic check 
 It's the Ill-Al Skratch-Shaq about to get tracked 
 Shaq it! I could freak it Shaqapello 
 This big fellow 
 Is that you're girlfriend? 
 How you doin' hello 
 A-E-I-O-U, and sometimes Y 
 Call me Jimmy Snuka 'cause I'm super fly 
 Now who's the man? Me 
 No one's greater- Big Ill 
 What's up Shaq? 
 Take me out with the fader 
 Knock 'em up, knock 'em up 
 Here I come dummy 
 Not even big Shaq can take a rebound from me 
 I'm gummy (?), my debt is set and paid in full 
 Comin' through like a writer or raging bull 
 You're jugular protect your neck 
 Because I'm strangling 
 The gang, a man, will leave you hanging 
 From a tree dangling 
 One two here I go the natural 
 When I start the flow 
 I'm not the average Joe Shmoe 
 Rhyme a' say rhyme a style 
 I mock who's style? 
 With the O-ee-o-ee-o-ee, o-ee-o-ee-ah 
 Don't let me play you 
 Not on this debut 
 With the 7-foot S-H-A-Q 
 Mic check, 1-2, 1-2, mic check 
 Mic check, 1-2, 1-2, mic check 
 Mic check, 1-2, 1-2, mic check 
 It's the Ill-Al Skratch-Shaq about to get tracked 
 Hey yo I got a bling ding 
 Throw on the camouflage 
 'Cause I'm livin' too large 
 I'm livin' too large 
 Everybody know my face, now I'm down with Shaq 
 With the uptown connect that's right you got my back 
 Big Ill, I bounce like the ball in his hand 
 Now can I pass it back? 
 Yes you can, yes you can-can 
 Ashes to ashes, dust to dust 
 Rhymes I bust 
 Don't want to cuss 
 I'm in a rush 
 Plussss... I'm on a warpath 
 So get lost, break off 
 Step off with you're stork bags (?) 
 Mama said knock who out 
 How that sound? 
 Down with the brothers from Brooklyn uptown 
 Connect! 
 You better hit the deck 
 And protect you're neck 
 When I end the mic check, I catch rep 
 Mic Check, 1-2, 1-2, mic check 
 Mic Check, 1-2, 1-2, mic check 
 Mic Check, 1-2, 1-2, mic check 
 It's the Ill-Al Skratch-Shaq about to get tracked 
 Tell me: who got my back? 
 I got you're back Shaq 
 I'm Big Ill, the mack 
 Creepin' through the hood with the nap sack 
 Pants sagging, hat cap to the rear 
 Slacker and so bobblin' 'cause I got the beer 
 You connect the funk known as mystique 
 Funk dunkah, lunkah funkah 
 My technique is at the finagle 
 Fly high, big up in the sky 
 I, why ask why? 
 Pleasure principle 
 No rump to bump hunt (?) 
 Times my art from Donald Trump 
 Inflate rhymes with my instra-pump 
 Tic-tac-toe I rip that flow 
 Like a real rap pro just to get that dough 
 Al-Skratch 
 Mac to my black groove 
 As I bust the jack move 
 My rap rules 
 I'm that smooth 
 Mic Check, 1-2, 1-2, mic check 
 Mic Check, 1-2, 1-2, mic check 
 Mic Check, 1-2, 1-2, mic check 
 It's the Ill-Al Skratch-Shaq about to get tracked 
 Mic Check, 1-2, 1-2, mic check 
 Mic Check, 1-2, 1-2, mic check
