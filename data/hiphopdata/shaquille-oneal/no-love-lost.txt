 Believe it or not, I love all playa hatas (bring it) 
 Ha ha ha ha 
 Cause ain't no love lost here baby 
 Say what you gotta say 
 (Tariq) 
 People know me on these streets playa 
 I ain't new 
 Lookin' at me all funny while I'm countin' my money 
 Surpise 
 What I do is already legalized 
 Analyze what I toss across 
 There ain't no love lost 
 (Shaq) 
 Exuberant, change, cross, exilhurated 
 Flomboyant, but boncey on beat breaks, I'm animated 
 Now it's been stated, I'm lyrically enthusiastic 
 I'm dope like all east coast CDs wrapped through plastic 
 What's the meaning of life, y'all should know 
 In my lifetime I need a whole lotta dough, bro 
 No need to get zealous, you jealous, say you jealous 
 I spike on that --- like Monica Seles 
 I split a divine rhyme, exsquisite like some elegant wine 
 Here's a toast, the world is mine 
 I promise I'm a keep it punk 
 I represent the real hip-hop, I ain't no freakin' country bumpkin 
 Hooparistic, freakaristic, poetic frenzy with conception 
 I got more flavor than a mystic 
 Fringe benfit-ic, urging y'all to get wit it 
 Style postulates, now pause while you gets splitted 
 I'm not just taco, I'm the whole enchilado 
 Enter any center blowin' up like Desperado

 L.A. to Bronx to Bekailen 
 Together we provide a ton of better on the way and 
 We rhyme related 
 Very under-estimated, that's why I'm winnin' 
 In this world of sins, steady grinning, money boss spendin' 
 Distanced from dirty women, Lord, I'm quite influential 
 Spirtualy and mental, what you into I'd a been through 
 Preachin' my words and don't know it, you owe it 
 It shows you wanna be me but won't show it 
 Ain't nothin' changed but the playas 
 The game remains the same 
 I had a ten year run, hey, I can't complain 
 Took the next step see, from Coke to Pepsi 
 From the B.X., we ridin' to South Beach on jet ski 
 Play to survive, you ain't live, you just livin' 
 You breathin' a good one, but where I'm from y'all forbidden 
 Come around, bad decision, you'd rather be in prison 
 Ain't no duckin' when I'm delivering, won't be forgiver-in' 
 Layin' there shiverin, half the night 
 You gotta walk towards the light, everything is aight 
 Make sure, everything you endure stays tight 
 Big Shaq, Lord Tariq, Jay-Z outta sight 
 (Jay-Z) 
 People know me on these streets and the towns I been through 
 Looking at me, stay focused, I'm givin' 'em straight focus 
 Suprise, what I do is already legalized 
 Analyze how I floss across 
 Of course there ain't no love lost

 Fo' sho', everything's for dough now 
 I flow, y'all gotta pay a little mo' now 
 It's platinumn, nowadays we put the gold down 
 We stepped it up, y'all don't ever wanna showdown 
 Get wetted up by the sleeve that leave the bets wild 
 Y'all don't like it, sue me 
 Got settled out 
 Ghettoed out, in the vehicle bent 
 These days I mellowed out 
 See, success make a fella content 
 Un huh 
 You know, this rap stuff, pop a ??? 
 Jay-Z hugo, course playa, you lost playa 
 I know you rappers wanna see me fail 
 But quick to see a six-hundred S.L. B-12 
 Live wit it 
 Y'all got dough to get get it 
 I got mine 
 Your little bit of money couldn't stop mine 
 Your block time too high, too many hands in your pie 
 Seventy thirty, the ------ work for, work for me 
 Bottom line
