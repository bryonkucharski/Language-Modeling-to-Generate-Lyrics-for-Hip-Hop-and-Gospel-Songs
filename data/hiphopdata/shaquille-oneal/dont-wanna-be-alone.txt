 Check it 
 Chorus: One Accord 
 I don't wanna be alone 
 No no no 
 I can't let you go 
 I won't let you go 
 Verse 1: One Accord 
 Thinking back 
 To when we first met 
 Your pretty brown eyes 
 Now how could I forget 
 That day when you caught my eye 
 Ooh girl you were looking so fly 
 Baby I don't wanna lose your love 
 Lady 
 Verse 2: One Accord 
 Can't you see 
 Just what you mean to me 
 You're every little thing 
 A man could ever need 
 The way you wear your hair 
 The stylish clothes you wear 
 It really turns me on 
 And I don't wanna be alone 
 Verse 3: Shaq 
 I got everything I want in this world except you 
 Mansions, villas and yacths, and friends won't do 
 I see you not amazed by my wealth and it's cool 
 My family, yo they be sayin' that you play me for a fool 
 So what a playa do? give it up for a sis 
 Cause you my dime you shine more than this joint on my wrist 
 L.A., me and you the whole world's at my feet 
 With you at my side my whole life is complete
