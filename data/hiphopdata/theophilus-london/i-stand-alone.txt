The journey starts beneath the stars I stand alone 
 I put all my fears to all these years, 
 Swept away they're known 
 And know I run this town to be near you 
 No gray skies has ever turned blue 
 I stand alone 
 I stand alone 
 I stand alone 
 I stand alone 
 The rain is phenomenal, the way that it falls 
 Slammin' down like a domino and lay in the moss 
 Today is a new day, I'm lookin' for new prey 
 I'm tryin' to survive, tryin' to take in this love so 
 The clothes don't make the man 
 It's the man that makes the clothes 
 And if this war doesn't end there's nothing left to fight 
 And I'm sure you'll have it tonight and 
 I stand alone 
 I stand alone 
 I stand alone 
 (And know I run this town to be near you) 
 I stand alone 
 (Gray skies never turn blue) 
 It's the skill and the confidence 
 The will and the dominance 
 The deeper you get, the more the revert is prominent 
 When Uncle Sam knock on door 
 I tell him that I'm headed for the dock on the shore 
 Sailin' away, are you comin' with? 
 Just pack for the stay, 'cause we're finna get, get (heh) 
 The war don't end there's nothing left to fight 
 And I'm sure you'll have it tonight 
 'Til I stand alone 
 It starts beneath the stars I stand alone 
 I put all my fears to all these years, swept away they're known 
 And know I run this town to be near you 
 And no gray skies ever turn blue 
 I stand alone 
 I stand alone 
 I stand alone 
 I stand alone 
 I stand alone 
 I stand alone 
 I stand alone 
 I stand alone
