And this here is my destiny 
 And it felt more fuckers death for me 
 Last night, evil stole my heart 
 But somehow I feel it resurrect in me 
 So toast out now, keep testing me 
 And you can talk your shit but have the check for me 
 And if your whole team from Long deserve the hip hop 
 Tell them they can get off my Herbie Hancock 
 It's more refresh breath could be 
 And if you don't know I tell you what's next for me, for me 
 From the bird's view, from the third view 
 In the sky without no curfew 
 From the bird's view, in the sky without no curfew 
 I know you've been waiting for the thunder 
 Let's give them the Indian summer

 People back to call me caps 
 But when you gonna drop that new shit 
 Home boy it's Theopilus the son 
 They wrote no more taken from a full of shit 
 Pick, pick up the phone 
 It's a girl trying to interview the spit in my cool shit 
 Is she coming over, fifty-fifty win 
 No home takin' no job, oh shit 
 The whole city covered in white 
 She discovered the light 
 Yeah, she get naked on Skype 
 And now she wear my night 
 Yes, I ain't gon' bow down to no man 
 I'm gonna say, "Aldo, that's cold, huh?" 
 I don't battle, I come program 
 Ge-ge-get broke to come grind

 In this here blight excellence 
 It's a nation of bloom black wrestlin' 
 I give them the elbow like Ray Johnson 
 I'm on Elizabeth like Steve Vossen 
 I'm with a rap chick gettin' a feed 'doption 
 Who got her hair red like Dee Votman 
 You can't stop now, I'ma keep boppin' 
 You a gay welfare nigga keep rockin' 
 Back to the rich front reflection 
 Some cops gave some change for the next trip 
 We go out for blaze source of action 
 They call me Flavor 'cause I rap shit 
 If you bite your directions 
 Popo in the back we rap shit 
 Super bad, save you, do me a favor 
 Keep getting your paper, come on
