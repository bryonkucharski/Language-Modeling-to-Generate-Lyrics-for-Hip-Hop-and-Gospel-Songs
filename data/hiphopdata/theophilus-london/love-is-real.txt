I fell in love with a disco queen 
 In the heart of the city at a bistro scene 
 A long story short, chick kinda at lost term 
 In the house to the port 
 We took a trip down Mexico 
 I nearly shopped myself like plexico 
 And with a mouth so fast, she was technico 
 Don't turn to a festival, hey 
 You walk to the show 
 I slept through the day, done nothing more 
 The sky lit up the stars 
 We're million miles apart to get where you are 
 Is that what you want? 
 'Cause love is real, just look at the time 
 Is that what you want? 
 'Cause love is real, just look at the time 
 Catch rest in the motel room 
 When the roosters call, I escape this doom 
 The humming bird is the humming man 
 Six years later you will understand 
 I spoke four words from the last night 
 Night, yikes 
 And the motherland for another life 
 Or another man, damn 
 You walk to the show 
 I slept through the day, done nothing more 
 The sky lit up the stars 
 We're million miles apart to get where you are 
 Is that what you want? 
 'Cause love is real, just look at the time 
 Is that what you want? 
 'Cause love is real, just look at the time 
 Try make the most of this 
 Don't throw it all away 
 She had to change her number twice 
 And no time to count the days 
 She a disco queen 
 Party all night like ya shit so clean 
 If you meet those eyes 
 It might be me in the deep skies 
 You walk to the show 
 I slept through the day, done nothing more 
 The sky lit up the stars 
 We're million miles apart to get where you are 
 Is that what you want? 
 'Cause love is real, just look at the time 
 Is that what you want? 
 'Cause love is real, just look at the time 
 You walk to the show 
 I slept through the day, done nothing more 
 The sky lit up the stars 
 We're million miles apart to get where you are 
 Is that what you want? 
 'Cause love is real, just look at the time 
 Is that what you want? 
 'Cause love is real, just look at the time 
 Is that what you want? 
 'Cause love is real, just look at the time 
 Is that what you want? 
 'Cause love is real, just look at the time
