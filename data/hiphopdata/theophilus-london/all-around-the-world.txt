Whoo 
 Bad boy just stepped town 
 Bad boy stepped town 
 Asked me, "I am worthy now?" 
 We heard that the best won't fuck around 
 Uh, we're the people who came to see 
 He came to break it down 
 Cut the lights, cue the sound 
 See the bodies hit the ground 
 Them pretty girls be textin' 
 They wonder where my stacks at 
 They call me futuristic 
 They think I am Mister Jetson 
 Uh, follow this tour bus 
 We'll get you to the next show 
 Un-forgetful 
 Dudes still be gettin' low 
 Ooh, we go all around the world everybody singin' along 
 Never lookin' back, it's a long, long way from my home 
 Ooh, just tell the sheriff that the party's goin' on all night long 
 We are back and makin' music like it's nineteen sixty four 
 Hey, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, hey 
 Back on the road again 
 Hittin' Paris on a tent 
 Kiss my mom and call my friends 
 Seems like this tour would never end 
 These kids is fly, these kids got attitude 
 This is a little somethin' that I had to do 
 'Cause tired of hearin' your crap 
 About who need to bring rap back 
 The girl, they snuck back stage like 
 "Can we get your autograph?" 
 The stupid interviews 
 Questions make us so all laugh 
 Who are you to ask? 
 Tell my PR I'm gonna pass 
 Skip the whiskey, roll a joint 
 Plus my outfit stays on purple 
 Ooh, we go all around the world everybody singin' along 
 Never lookin' back, it's a long, long way from my home 
 Ooh, just tell the sheriff that the party's goin' on all night long 
 We are back and makin' music like its nineteen sixty four 
 Melbourne, Paris, Tokyo, Berlin 
 London, Liverpool, Beijing, New York 
 Melbourne, Paris, Tokyo, Berlin 
 London, Liverpool, Beijing, New York 
 Uh, this feels so good right now 
 You're now listenin' to the world renowned international 
 International player, uh 
 All around the world, seen all around, the best 
 See many places, many different things 
 Every night I wake up and I respect 
 Close your eyes and go to dreams 
 I've seen it all, baby 
 Ooh, we go all around the world everybody singin' along 
 Never lookin' back, it's a long, long way from my home 
 Ooh, just tell the sheriff that the party's goin' on all night long 
 We are back and makin' music like its nineteen sixty four 
 Ooh, we go all around the world everybody singin' along
