Gone until the early evenin', search for her, a voice inside 
 That I've been yearnin' for your love, if there's a way to catch you 
 Through the air waves, to change your mind 
 Tonight I hope you hear me callin' one last time, hey 
 Everybody is somebody's baby 
 Until the point till you drive me crazy 
 And no answer, no phone, I'm not home 
 Drop everythin', headed over to Stockholm 
 You dealt with your fears, hide the truth 
 The out lookin' in, ignited the fuse 
 The words you made emerge 
 Leadin' on a verse to a path you should deserve 
 People around town tell me words, it's absurd 
 Now I got a light in the dark, I'm at the curve 
 Lookin' for my love like you're mighty but only hurt 
 Never face to face but it's time we make it work, make it work 
 Hold up, got stories to tell 
 Someone pack us in smile, have recorded the mail, the mail 
 My love, my love, see you next time 
 Just know, never forget mine, hey 
 Gone until the early evenin', search for her, a voice inside 
 That I've been yearnin' for your love, if there's a way to catch you 
 Through the air waves, to change your mind 
 Tonight I hope you hear me callin' one last time, hey 
 Talk to me, I need you now 
 Sing to me and soothe my ail 
 See it was all giggles when you was here 
 And now the snapshot, is it shoe for nail? 
 You the queen bee on some love kim shit 
 Let's fly away, handle our business 
 My best bud and my hug bug 
 And now you know I've got bitten by a love bug 
 And when you're dancin', shake that curly hair 
 Strange takin' back to the early years 
 Had a skin tick, I was lookin' for a clue 
 I'm checkin' in, ask the clerk if he saw you 
 And on some young shit, hum drum dumb shit 
 Skyline great, got my body on some numb shit 
 If not now, guess I'll see you next time 
 Just know, never forget mine, hey 
 Gone until the early evenin', search for her, a voice inside 
 That I've been yearnin' for your love, if there's a way to catch you 
 Through the air waves, to change your mind 
 Tonight I hope you hear me callin' one last time, hey 
 Gone until the early evenin', search for her, a voice inside 
 That I've been yearnin' for your love, if there's a way to catch you 
 Through the air waves, to change your mind 
 Tonight I hope you hear me callin' one last time, hey
