You stole my heart like a thief in the night 
 Stopped in your tracks in the middle of a fight 
 To make it right let the brimstone's burn 
 I'll letchu' live yours, now let me have my turn 
 Butchu' wrong thinking you could stop time 
 A few hours ahead baby girl not mine 
 I look ahead I know you see the stop signs 
 Blind men know, it's not green on time 
 You drive me insane Mrs. Rain Cloud 
 Moving on the road, took the same vow 
 Now I'm tryna u-turn on the way out 
 The fire all around us is played out 
 Standing on all fours on the bed 
 They say some things is better not said 
 I'll paint you red and stick horns on your head 
 I'll paint you red and stick horns on your head 
 If you think you're special, you're probably not 
 Why, why, why even try? (Why even try?) 
 Just living a lie (Living a lie) 
 Never been like that (Never been like that) 
 So why even try? Why even try to change? 
 Okay, okay Mrs. Rain Cloud 
 Make the sun shine till the days out 
 You're not alone, call my name out 
 But what if, there's no way out 
 And no, your words aren't audible 
 Reception is bad when I'm calling you 
 Confusion, and it's the thought of you 
 You're no spy, I'm onto you 
 This letter was written in bitter form 
 So read carefully, don't get it wrong 
 See that's us, but that's gone 
 The scarecrows, in the back lawn 
 That's another dress, well put that on 
 I keep it real, is that wrong? 
 I'll paint you red and stick horns on your head 
 I'll paint you red and stick horns on your head 
 If you think you're special, you're probably not 
 Why, why, why even try? (Why even try?) 
 Just living a lie (Living a lie) 
 Never been like that (Never been like that) 
 So why even try? Why even try to change? 
 Making little sunshine 
 Till lthe days out 
 Making your sunshine 
 Till your calling my name out 
 What if there's not a simple way out'? 
 Reception is bad and you're calling me now 
 Never been like that 
 Never be like that 
 Why, why, why even try? (Why even try?) 
 Just living a lie (Living a lie) 
 Never been like that (Never been like that) 
 So why even try? Why even try to change?
