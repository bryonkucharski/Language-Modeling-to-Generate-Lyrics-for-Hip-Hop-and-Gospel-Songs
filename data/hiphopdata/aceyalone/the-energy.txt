Gather around, gather around 
 We are about to spark this potential energy 
 And we gonna channel it to one source 
 Because the energy can, and will be dictated 
 In any direction, in any situation 
 Any which way any one shall choose 
 Right now since I'm the center of this energy 
 I choose to make it positive energy 
 And as for the negative energy 
 I'm gonna overpower the negative energy 
 Because I know it's out there and it's like a disease 
 And see, once my light magnifies, the disease dies 
 Ya understand once my light magnifies the disease dies 
 The energy 
 Yeah, disease can't fight oxygen and light 
 I box 'em in so tight, nowhere they gon' go 
 And jiggawatts is low, they won't know what hit em 
 I warn em, then I let the energy submit em 
 Police yourself, increase your wealth 
 So you can live longer and stronger, for real doe 
 I don't know what you subject to 
 But I suppose it, ain't a bed of roses 
 And neither is mine, so let the energy combine 
 There's strength in numbers, there's no need to wonder 
 Or slumber, or blunder 
 From the land down under the pipe storms drain 
 Wouldn't hurt so good but it's, not pain 
 I mean it hurts so good but it's, not pain 
 I said it hurts so good but it's, not pain 
 Just the electric charge comin' from the mainframe 
 And my main aim to dig through the dirt, stay alert 
 Insert the power cord so my energy will work 
 Pure energy spurts, sporadic, automatic 
 Mathematic melodramatic -- acrobatic 
 Diplomatic, charisssssmatic 
 Even my static, asiatic 
 Microphone fanatic 'alone 
 Blown in, in the whirlwind 
 Eye of the storm, make the energy transform 
 And convert, introvert turn extrovert 
 Assert myself to eliminate the hurt
