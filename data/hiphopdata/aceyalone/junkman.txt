(Somebody say ho-oh...) 
 (Say ho-oh-oh...) 
 (Aceyalone - talking) 
 Yesss man 
 But I'm not a motherfuckin' yes man 
 Yeah you know how it goes down 
 You just longer now, ain't nothing to it but to get it done 
 You know I'mma throw in this PMG 
 I got this love and hate on my mind 
 You know I'm sayin'; it's a cool little summer day 
 You know winter day, spring day, fall day, everyday, all day 
 You know good brothers own day with sisters 
 Good life baby 
 You can catch me rollin' through your area 
 In something big like a aircraft carrier 
 With the big beat bangin' on the stere-a 
 Sitting next to a pitbull terrie-a 
 On the loan so it's no hysteria 
 In the cut just like the interio-a 
 Scoop the homies so it's more the merrier 
 You make a move for ya mic and I'll bury ya 
 (Aceyalone) 
 You either got new friends or new enemies 
 When you show the world ya true identity 
 You see I move with a God type energy 
 It's so big one of me make ten of me 
 You have no idea what it's finna be 
 You see the whole car smoking like a chim-a-ney 
 Yeah I got the poison and the remedy 
 To get mo' hands moving in the center p 
 (Ah, that was tight) 
 (Yeah the west keezy easy) 
 (Yeah, AC... hey man, wha?, hey, hey!) 
 (Aceyalone) 
 Rollin' in my two thousand and twenty-one 
 More than machine with expandable wings 
 I land on the scene like a man from a dream 
 And grip the highway like water in the stream 
 Faster than your locomotive 
 Swoop by quick so no one would notice 
 Project lotus to styles to oldest 
 The coldest motherfuckas with the world on they shoulders 
 Top break-a bigga than a tank-a 
 Might stop and drop the anchor 
 Make em' bounce an ounce on my lap 
 And that's a rap, that's a rap (that's a rap, that's a rap) 
 Drive by just like Mr. Invisible 
 You can't see me, it's not possible 
 You can't feel me out, it's not probable 
 Control the course and move past the obstacles 
 (Aceyalone) 
 You either got new friends or new enemies 
 When you show the world ya true identity 
 You see I move with a god type energy 
 It's so big one of me make ten of me 
 You have no idea what it's finna be 
 You see the whole car smoking like a chim-a-ney 
 Yeah I got the poison and the remedy 
 To get mo' hands moving in the center p
