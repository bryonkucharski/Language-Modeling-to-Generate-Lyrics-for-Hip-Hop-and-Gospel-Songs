Greetings 
 Ok I'll make this short 
 We in the house 
 We got mikah 9 abstract rude peace 
 Vic hop fat jack and myself aceyalone 
 We come for the glory of the b-boy kingdom 
 Bring them laughter after which bring them tears 
 I seen it comin' and knew it was a plot 
 Legislation had a plan to kill hip hop 
 I got wind from a snitch I kept in contact w/this 
 Bitch ass judge who was paid off 
 Soon after that he got laid off 
 I'm lettin' niggas know you tryin' to stop a muthafucka's flow 
 Hold your black stallions and your black sheeps 
 Black clan aided a nigga and got heat 
 We met up on stepney and market sparked it 
 Mapped out the target 
 We gon' take out their number one sergeant 
 Young and strong we bailed up on their front lawn 
 To kill the enemy 
 Remember me 
 Well if you remember me you'll remember 
 I'm the one who broke into the pentagon took fouls planted bombs 
 Now I possess the blueprint 
 I counter the message you sent 
 No longer will you slander and tamper w/our music 
 Copies of the document we're xeroxed 
 The ghetto took offense in defense of hip hop 
 Shot down rolled 'em up loc'ed up bailed out 
 Saved the day 
 Then into thin air I fade away 
 Scorpion 
 We come for the glory of the b-boy kingdom 
 Bring them laughter after which bring them tears 
 The story had never been told until now 
 As the glory of the kingdom come comes down 
 Disguised as a janitor the washman 
 I swept and mopped the floors 
 Better yet I was a spook behind the door 
 W/a perfect view from the bannister 
 Feeling like lee harvey 
 'Cept I got a hundred million years in me 
 First thing I did was aim 
 Lock him in my scope 
 Squeeze 
 Bust his melon open now I'm pleased 
 In the name of mc's 
 Already passed the time that they allotted me 
 The housekeeper spotted me 
 It was either her or me 
 Click clack 
 She says I will not say what I see 
 But I never could have trusted her so I busted her in her chest 
 Then laughed 
 Then headed for the elevator shaft 
 But it was too late the jig was up 
 There was pigs all in the building 
 So I tried to escape to the fire escape from homicide 
 Yeah I killed him 
 Hangin' from the third story ladder 
 I dropped and I felt my ankle shatter 
 No time to lose juice from my bladder 
 My mission was completed and that was all that mattered 
 The van was parked a hundred yards from the scene of the crime 
 But it was hard to run w/a broken foot 
 Just like I thought they blasted 
 I took one to the gut 
 I was laying there thinkin' about death 
 Just watchin' my blood spill out 
 Just then the van pulls up and I jump in 
 And then we pull out (? lickin'?) shouts for the glory 
 We come for the glory of the b-boy kingdom 
 Bring them laughter after which bring them tears 
 I walk in like a normal black 
 Gun peckin' jaw snatching 
 Slide 
 They like the way I glide 
 To the back break out my backpack and stack my shit up 
 Ah it's bulging now 
 Looked around heard a gun shot 
 Pow 
 I looked down I whipped out my shit 
 Unloaded my clip 
 Jetting by the count I slipped 
 Tripped out 
 Landed on my hip crawled out 
 I hit a tuck and roll up and out 
 Into a flip and boned out now I'm zonin' 
 I'm nine glocks and seven 380's richer 
 I'm fit to blow the foundation off this beyotch up 
 Synchronized for the race 
 I push the button 
 Nuke the place 
 Timed myself dashin to the ride 
 I hops inside 
 Keys already in the ignition 
 I cranks it slaps it in drive 
 Fizorty-fizive seconds till dizamage 
 Ride b-boy 
 Kingdom 
 We come for the glory of the b-boy kingdom 
 Bring them laughter after which bring them tears 
 We come for the glory of the b-boy kingdom 
 Bring them laughter after which bring them tears
