(Uncredited spoken word poet forms the song's intro) 
 I had forgotten the incredible butter softness of his long fingers. 
 How they felt on my back when he slow-dragged with me, 
 At a fateful "Blue Lights in the Basement" party. 
 The dim lights making his honey-colored eyes barely visible as he, 
 Flashed a penlight in my eyes! 
 "Look directly into the light this time." 
 (Aceyalone) 
 I say look into the light 
 See what you look like 
 I scribble on a clean surface, the earthless and worthless {*echoes* 
 It's life, at the tunnel of the point of purchase {*echoes* 
 Aiyyo freedom got a microphone, AND a AK {*echoes* 
 Make way, and prepare for the melee {*echoes* 
 (Aceyalone) 
 The method of my madness could NEVER be known 
 The microphone magic of Aceyalone 
 Don't, try to set home or off of the dome 
 Because wigs are known to be SPLIT 
 And a, fan is known to be hit with shit 
 Rubber band flows that snap back in place 
 Rap in they face, get this motherfucker outta here 
 He talks way way way WAY too much 
 Spit for the victory, till they sick of me 
 I never wallow in the bickery or trickery 
 There's no con-FUSION, just the FUSION 
 No il-LUSION, cause God rule them 
 Held high, nailed in the sky 
 The artistic eye leaves you mystified 
 You're once denied, soon openly obliged 
 (Aceyalone) 
 They say, "rock you don't stop" but what you talkin' bout 
 Well let me guess, you come fi test 
 But test not he who knows best, put nonsense to rest 
 Preachin on a soapbox, dope on the block 
 Choke on your tongue, smoke from the gun 
 Broke in the middle, I hope you're havin' fun 
 HIGH post, high dose, high strung 
 Wind through the lungs, spirit of the young 
 Salt on the slug, caught with the plug 
 Fought with the drugs, taught by the thugs 
 Eye of a tiger, head of a lion 
 Walkin' through the interior of Siberia 
 Chip away at the rock, or a dynamite block 
 Right where they had to stop, we continue 
 Think the worst, ink into the verse 
 Sink into the earth, die by the end of the rhyme 
 What a rush, too much to discuss 
 I close it up by sayin' this
