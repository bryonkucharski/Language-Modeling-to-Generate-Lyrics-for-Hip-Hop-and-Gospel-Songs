All right, yo, this all came about one time when... 
 I was, I was, I was, on a plane back going back to Los Angeles 
 Coming back from somewhere else 
 And I sat next to this lady and she was telling me some things 
 I don't remember it verbatim but I do remember some of the things she said 
 It was like this 
 She said... 
 Life as we know it is about to change 
 I smell it within the air, the weather is getting strange 
 Drugged up, sedated and numb from the pain 
 The sickness in America has spread to her brain 
 She is no longer fit to make good decisions 
 She is completely blind and void of any vision 
 She parties hard and she keeps her conscious mind in prison 
 Therefore, she's headed for the ultimate collision 
 She can no longer hide the scars on her face 
 The innocence, now gone, is hard to replace 
 She has no shame, no remorse, or any grace 
 She embraces the Devil and she hates over race 
 Ms. America, the beautiful, the free 
 Fallen within the cracks I wish that you could see 
 She buried her misery with this society 
 It's obvious you've got no regard for me (yeah) 
 That's why you caught up, in the belly of America (yeah) 
 Lost, in the stomach of America (yeah) 
 Broken down, in the bowels of America (yeah) 
 Sinkin, in the garbage of America (yeah) 
 STUCK, in the brain of America (yeah) 
 Sufferin, in the body of America 
 Lyin', in the wicked spirit of America (yeah) 
 Dying, in the old soul of America (yeah) 
 Ms. America, you've been a very bad girl 
 You nearly disgraced humanity in the eyes of the world 
 Vanity has took you over, you're not deserving 
 The mirror of reflection, is quite disturbing 
 She made so many promises, she couldn't keep 
 She neglected to mother her young, so they don't sleep 
 They scream out for justice, and then they weep 
 We're not to blame Ms. America, it's what you reap 
 The audacity of your inventions to rule us all 
 The tragedy of your intentions, to fool us all 
 You should've gave in to nature, and to the law 
 It's only a matter of time, before you fall 
 The things you should've worked out, in your first colony 
 Took some of your own advice, and your psychology 
 You destroyed all morale, and the ecology 
 I'm sorry but I don't accept your apology (yeah) 
 I'm caught up, in the belly of America (yeah) 
 Lost, in the stomach of America (yeah) 
 Broken down, in the bowels of America (yeah) 
 Sinkin, in the garbage of America (yeah) 
 STUCK, in the brain of America (yeah) 
 Sufferin, in the body of America (yeah) 
 Lyin', in the wicked spirit of America 
 Dying, in the old soul of America (yeah) 
 Oh Ms. America, so much attraction 
 They should've taken responsibility for their actions 
 We work around the system and make adaptions 
 So you could let freedom ring, within your faction 
 How can people still be hungry, when there's a surplus? 
 Suffering within your home, you made them worthless 
 Damn near police the state, and make us nervous 
 Even though some conform and join your service 
 Your presidency is the biggest joke, but where the laugh? 
 I always smell the gun smoke, on your behalf 
 I think I should send a telegram to your staff 
 America, you're down and dirty 
 You need a bath 
 So tell your Secret Agents don't be paranoid 
 This wasn't taught by Socrates or Sigmund Freud 
 This is simply God's work, you can't avoid 
 Every nation ever built, has been destroyed (yeah) 
 'Cause we caught up, in the belly of America (yeah) 
 Lost, in the stomach of America (yeah) 
 Broken down, in the bowels of America (yeah) 
 Sinkin, in the garbage of America 
 STUCK, in the brain of America (yeah) 
 Sufferin, in the body of America (yeah) 
 Trying, in the good old spirit of America (yeah) 
 Dying, in the old soul of America (yeah)
