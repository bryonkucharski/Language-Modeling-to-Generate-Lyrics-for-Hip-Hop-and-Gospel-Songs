 Heavy on the green, don't pop the pill 
 Amphetamine, or aspirin

 And if the DJ pull up, I still do my thing 
 Hey! I gotta let you know I'm (real, real, real, real)

 Look, I'm exceptional shine (real, real, real, real)

 Psyched, motivational I guess it's just 
 A sign of the times, and when I'm facin' you 
 It's real, real, real high, I got a tune for you 
 More than just a couple of lines...
