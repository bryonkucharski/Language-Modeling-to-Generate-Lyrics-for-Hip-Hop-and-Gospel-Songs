It goes one for the treble, two for the bass 
 Brace, Brace 
 In your face 
 I said one for the treble, two for the bass 
 Brace, Brace 
 In your face 
 I said one for the treble, two for the bass 
 I said, I said, I said one for the treble, two for the bass 
 Come on Acey, let's rock this place 
 Aceyalone: 
 Now I am the man, yes I'm only the man 
 And when it's time expand 
 I'll chop my way to the center and I'll stand 
 Feet first, me first 
 Baby, bubba 
 Let me show you what it all boils down to 
 I'll tap that ???? clown you 
 Now you know the half 
 Pullin' their wigs completly off they scalps 
 Writin' and recitin' is the easy part 
 To have a little style is the hard part 
 I'm moving like an aardvark 
 Screamin all your marks from the jump start 
 I'm ready after dark so spark 
 Up an L, now what the hell? 
 You've been here before, you know how it goes 
 Abstract Rude: 
 Actually, I've found the key to my survival 
 Now I'm liable to do anything to come up up and about 
 Well I can get in it and I can get wild 
 I can get up, I can get out, I can get around with style 
 Well, I've been rhyming since '84 when I was a child 
 I was good then, now I'm good, now I'm a be real good for a while (Abstract) 
 And Aceyalone on the microphone, service you constantly 
 [Acey:] I'm Aceyalone on the microphone I service you constantly (Abstract 
 Rude) 
 Both: 
 Yes Yes Y'all 
 I guess y'all 
 Now what the fuck y'all 
 Thought I had it bucked y'all 
 I didn't just touch y'all 
 All balls don't bounce 
 Bounce, bounce 
 Bounce, bounce (ooh give it to me) 
 spoken: 
 In your face, big baby 
 In your face 
 Aceyalone, Abstract Rude, Tribe Unique up in this open wide 
 Yeah we up in here wide open, fools 
 You just not knowin' 
 You just not knowin' 
 And you ain't gonna never know 
 That's the thing, you ain't gonna never know 
 All b-balls don't b-bounce, fool 
 Yeah, service you constantly 
 All b-balls don't b-bounce, fool 
 Bounce, bounce 
 Bounce, bounce 
 Bounce, bounce 
 Bounce, bounce 
 You're not bouncing 
 Yo they say how you doing 
 How you runnin' through 
 You runnin' through the maze 
 Lost in the masquerade 
 Lost, all these fools is lost 
 In a maaaasquerade 
 I went to the masquerade party 
 I pulls up 
 Perfectly manicured head 
 Yo, take that back 
 Right to the top 
 (Chorus fades out)
