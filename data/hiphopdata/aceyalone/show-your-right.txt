Aww... show your right 
 To all of my brothers 
 Show your right 
 To all of my sisters 
 Show your right 
 To my mothers and my fathers 
 Show your right, you know you're right 
 Show your right 
 Yeah, what up people livin' in this world 
 Who know that the time is now 
 Peace to the sun child, Gods and earths alike 
 Truly we got that know-how, we got that know-how 
 That what, where, why and when 
 Oh, wow, is that fool at it again? 
 Oh yes, we goin' to the promised land, jack 
 Where you won't get spooked by a casper 
 Last of the second half who spoke and spat it 
 Kick the science and then math to add it 
 Life is a habit 
 Don't combat it, dog 
 I gots to breathe and smoke before I breathe in smog 
 I step outside and I hug the street 
 I spit life through the mic, flow and love the beats 
 So let me count the ways while I count my scars 
 I count for paydays but I still count stars 
 Can't count counterclockwise 
 I gotta count yards 
 So don't count me out on account I ain't actin' hard 
 So don't tell me how it could be 
 'Cause positivity has been good to me 
 And negativity is no good to me 
 It's not good for me 
 It's understood to me 
 Show your right 
 To all of my homies 
 Show your right 
 To my fair weather friends 
 Show your right 
 To all the people that love me 
 Show your right 
 And all the people that hate me 
 Show your right 
 All the people in shackles 
 Show your right 
 And for the people that passed 
 Show your right 
 Back to the essence 
 Show your right, you know you're right 
 Show your right 
 Now what if I told you you never gonna win 
 Too high to get over to low to get under 
 You stuck in the middle and you never gettin' in 
 Universal soldier smokes too much doja 
 Can't stay sober to hold your game 
 When you're all numbed up like novocaine 
 Well just wash my brain, I can't complain 
 About a thang 
 I'm walkin' outside in the rain 
 Yes, I'm walkin' outside in the rain 
 I ain't scared of the rain 
 Or the sleet or the snow or the pain 
 Or the pleasure or the loss or the gain 
 Sorry that I didn't get to read your mind 
 Instead I read in between the lines 
 Gotta break ground when I break down 
 Don't make a sound 
 The snakes are all around, intend to take you down 
 But I can see their intent 
 Even though I look through the eyes of a squint 
 And I get bent 
 Hmm they constantly askin' why 
 Havin' the audacity to question my capacity 
 But I won't be pacified or classified 
 Shit, I'll be the last to die 
 Show your right 
 To all the free thinkers 
 Show your right 
 To the worldwide scams (?) 
 Show your right 
 To the old and the wise 
 Show your right 
 To the young and the curious 
 Show your right 
 I got my ears on the ?? 
 Show your right 
 I got my eyes on the future 
 Show your right 
 I got my physical finesse 
 Show your right 
 You know you're, show your right 
 Oh yes, put your bid in 
 Get in where you fit in 
 Sittin' on these righteous flows 
 Head shoulders knees and toes 
 Move that body across the floor 
 Head shoulders knees and toes 
 Move that body across the floor 
 Uh, yeah
