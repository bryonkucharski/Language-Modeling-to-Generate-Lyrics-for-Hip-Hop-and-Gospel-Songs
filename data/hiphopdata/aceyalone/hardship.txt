Yeah! and you don't stop 
 Now, once again ace one is on the wax 
 And this one goes out to everybody 
 Who experienced in their lifetime 
 Or going to experience in their lifetime some type of hardship 
 Because everybody goes through hardships 
 See hardship belongs to me 
 I will never give it away or sell it for a fee 
 I regret to inform you I will never set it free 
 Everyday I'm reminded of how hard it could be 
 I take my pain just like a g 
 Got my struggle of life down to a t 
 It's nobody's fault but mine if I can't see 
 So I open my eyes and start looking for the key 
 Hardship is mine to hold onto 
 All through to the yellow brick road it goes 
 My shoulders got the heaviest load but I pack light 
 And I compensate I got act right when I conversate 
 See some people relate but they don't understand the words 
 Some people can climb mountains but can't jump curbs 
 And vice verse. I know it's such a nice verse 
 But hardship makes everything worse 
 And worse is a reminder to stay on the path 
 But hardship is mine to have 
 Because hardship keeps me in check 
 Mainly so I can check myself I give up full respect 
 Because he's real like a hundred-dollar bill 
 Without hardship you wouldn't appreciate your meals 
 Without hardship I wouldn't appreciate my skills 
 And so I do and so I grew and so I knew 
 That hardship not only makes most of my days blue 
 But it teaches me how to struggle in the jungle 
 And never crumble and how to remain humble 
 Some people they live life inside a glass case 
 Some people they live life in the vastness of space 
 And others will live long at a snail's pace 
 I live with hardship slapping me in the face 
 Because hardship belongs to me, 
 I will never give it away or sell it for a fee 
 I regret to inform you I will never set it free 
 Everyday I'm reminded of how hard it could be 
 How hard it could be... 
 How hard it could be... 
 Everyday I'm reminded of how hard it could be.
