I think 
 My name's the reverend deacon minister maximillion speaking to you 
 About the laws of the land and flaws of man 
 See the walls can't stand higher than we can put 'em now can they 
 Anybody need to be saved today 
 Got a 2 for 1 special w/a shave today 
 Now how 'bout I wave the tray and I pave the way 
 To the front of the church I don't really wanna hurt ya 
 But what I really wanted to say was that uh 
 There's something special inside of my mental cargo vessel 
 And it runs on lethal ethyl methane profane 
 Kinda like a flux capacitor 
 But it ain't no passengers 
 It's more like a capsule that snaps so quick 
 Or the rap's so sick or the absolutely 
 Put together each and every link and get me cosmically in sync 
 I think
