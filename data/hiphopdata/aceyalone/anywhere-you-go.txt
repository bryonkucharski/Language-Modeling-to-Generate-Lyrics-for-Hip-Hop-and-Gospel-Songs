Check it out y'all... 
 This is aceyalone on the microphone 
 And we got my nigga punish on the beatbox 
 And we gonna show you how we does it... 
 Anywhere you go 
 I am going to find you 
 And every time you flow 
 I'll be right behind you 
 Just to let you know and 
 Constantly remind you 
 You can never be as dope as I am 
 God-damn 
 Now I know you hate it when the MC ain't fly 
 So I come in the party live 
 Chopping rappers down to size 
 I know 'em when I see 'em 'cause they got that look in their eyes 
 Surprise 
 Aceyalone has arrived 
 They surround around the microphone like shit attracts flies 
 I arise 
 The thai gets me high 
 I find him, stand right behind him and I spy 
 No more than two tries; either freaks it or you die 
 I waited; somebody stated "he's intimidated" 
 I was faded; I played it like any other brother would've played it 
 Nut soon as I grabbed the microphone I went into a frenzy 
 Started givin' niggaz black eyes like spuds mackenzie 
 When that bud's in me 
 Now one of these niggaz tried to tell me my shit was hopeless 
 His homeboy was on the other side sayin' "man your shit's the dopest" 
 All of a sudden another rapper pushed his way through the crowd 
 Came and stood in front of me and told me he was proud 
 Then he bowed, told me that he liked the way I styled 
 I thanked him, I smiled 
 Then I had to be out 
 Anywhere you go 
 I am going to find you 
 And every time you flow 
 I'll be right behind you 
 Just to let you know and 
 Constantly remind you 
 You can never be as dope as I am 
 God-damn 
 Now I'ma give shout out to all the dope MC's in the world... 
 Y'all know who you are 
 You know I got the kinda style that everybody yearns 
 I mic check; I break a niggaz nectar like kerns 
 Cause you are a worm, you are a germ 
 And you are about to be stepped on 
 So you should be concerned 
 Iif you have a perm then it's permanent 
 It's affirmative you will burn 
 Make a right turn turn 
 Then a left turn 
 Then a u-turn turn 
 Come all the way back, return 
 Stand stern and maybe you just might learn 
 About the firm 
 I used to be a sperm -- shoot 
 Got derm 
 Nobody better not squirm 
 Till my meeting is adjourned 
 Okay I'm through 
 And I rock from here to peru 
 Vern 
 I could've sworn you knew 
 That ac's having a rap sale 
 You wanna buy 1 or 2? 
 Or 3 or 4 or 5 
 Or 6 or 7 or 8 
 Or 9 or 10 or 11 
 Or 12 or 13 or 14? 
 Cause me and the mic are courting 
 My circuit breaker's shorting 
 My memory is aborting 
 I can barely remember this flow 
 But wack MC's ya still got another zillion miles or so to go 
 Anywhere you go 
 I am going to find you 
 And every time you flow 
 I'll be right behind you 
 Just to let you know and 
 Constantly remind you 
 You can never be as dope as I am 
 God-damn 
 They pushed that rapper in front of the train 
 Took him to the doctor sewed his arm on again 
 Stabbed that rapper right in his heart 
 Gave him a transplant for a brand new start 
 And then he stopped; he started again 
 He forted bounced it and vomited 
 Now you know who's the dominant dog 
 That got to be given you that rhyme style 
 Man child, locked in the promised land 
 I'ma stand in the middle of an open hand 
 That's extensive 
 'Cause I don't flow religiously or relentlessly 
 For innocent-minded-ticity 
 Okay I win and the battle's like over 
 Got a satellite rover 
 With a rocket telescopic sprocket pocket pulley 
 And a fully automatic stun gun 'cause I'm a bully 
 My hair was wooly I'm a muillion 
 A calmer jeffrey dahmer hater 
 I'm greater than the latest greatest innovators 
 Can go to hell, 'cause I say this so well 
 You can whistle my melody or noel 
 You're still gonna get the speak 'n' spell 
 I get my ink from inkwell 
 My paper from the trees 
 I swell up when I eat mcs 
 So eat these 
 And stand at attention 
 Did I forget to mention 
 My classes aren't expensive 
 That's if you are an uncomprehensive 
 Defensive sensitive 
 Toy rapper 
 Little boy rapper 
 Momma's wittle wappin man wapper 
 Now you got me reachin' for my zapper 
 I'll cut you off with a clapper 
 But that's for old gentlemen 
 Who drink coffee with cinnamon, it'll take ten of them 
 Then again did I mention I'm potent 
 Totin holdin' reloadin votin 
 With my channel changer fool 
 And since I don't speak greek stranger 
 I'ma give it to you in layman's terms so you'll learn... 
 Anywhere you go 
 I am going to find you 
 And every time you flow 
 I'll be right behind you 
 Just to let you know and 
 Constantly remind you 
 You can never be as dope as I am 
 God-damn
