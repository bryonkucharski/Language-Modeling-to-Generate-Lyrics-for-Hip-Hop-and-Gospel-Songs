It's about the art 
 It's about the all right... all right listen 
 First rule of Art Club, there is no Art Club 
 Second rule of Art Club, there is no Art Club 
 Walkin' around, talkin' to myself 
 But you're only crazy if you answer back and the chances of that 
 Are high enough to scrape the sky, me myself and I 
 My inner battles are way more excitin than the ones I have on the mic 
 I have the time of my life 
 Dissectin it, overstandin it and perfectin it 
 And protectin it, it's become my drive 
 The more it gets to be heard, the longer it stays alive 
 My Art, Club 
 We meet daily, we sleep rarely, we bend barely 
 Fairly new, very artsy, very artsy 
 Do not disturb the session in progression 
 Just my teachers, and students and employees 
 And a map of the world, I could rap to the world, destroy MC's 
 Let it be noted that, no one man can hold it 
 Most overloaded and folded under the pressure 
 Most difficult task, last shall be first to get the treasure 
 To carry hot stones is an honor, and a duty 
 Storm weather, warm weather 
 And rainy nights, my Art Club built of solid steel 
 Yeah you know 
 And one diamond light 
 Your interpretation of artists you know 
 Will always be in the forefront of the world's... 
 Future, it's past, imagination y'know 
 Yeah it's true, aight... 
 I refuse to take part, in any lesser art - felt 
 Break your little hip-hop art and watch you melt 
 First assignment, evoke the path, provoke the future 
 Choke and strangle your Devil before he shoots ya 
 Full of serum to fear him 
 But my Club supports the God so it's difficult to hear him 
 We meet, over the beat, bring your drum machines and (?) 
 Dem days fly by fast, meditating with the sensei 
 Be forever in debt with the powers that be 
 My solid steel integrity, kills a celebrity 
 So let it be, we shall fulfill our destiny 
 My Art Club

 The current show was called, 
 "Art Hurts: Visions From Young Los Angeles Artists." 
 It was a madhouse!
