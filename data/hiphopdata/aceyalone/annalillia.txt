Yo I met this queen yo I met this queen named Annalillia 
 Annalillia oh Annalillia 
 Annalillia oh Annalillia 
 Annalillia oh Annalillia 
 I bet you think I'm silly huh Annalillia 
 Annalillia oh Annalillia 
 Annalillia oh Annalillia 
 Annalillia oh Annalillia 
 I bet you think I'm silly huh Annalillia 
 Now I was in a bar when I met Annalillia 
 Drunk and high drinkin' shots of tequillia 
 Chasin' it with genuine draft 
 Tellin' wack jokes as the bartender laughed 
 I was about one drink away from my limit 
 In came a black dress with a black body in it 
 She looked so timid 
 It took me a minute 
 To get her in focus 
 He said what'll it be 
 And just so she could notice acey I said yo this one's on me 
 And she stormed 
 I don't even know who you are fool 
 Keepin' that barstool warm like Norm 
 Then it hit me 
 Right there center in my heartbeat 
 Shot down but I loved it 
 I was talkin' out the bottom of a shot glass anyways 
 I says I insist that I pays 
 By the ways 
 What your mama name you what they call you 
 Can I call you and soon claim you 
 I was diggin' a hole I knew I'd fall through 
 But I aimed to just understand her 
 A woman that not many men knows 
 She looked me in my windows and said Annalillia 
 Annalillia? 
 Annalillia oh Annalillia 
 Annalillia oh Annalillia 
 Annalillia oh Annalillia 
 I mean well really uh Annalillia 
 Annalillia oh Annalillia 
 Annalillia oh Annalillia 
 Annalillia oh Annalillia 
 You wanna smoke this philly huh Annalillia 
 Now once I broke the ice on the lake the water felt cold 
 But nevertheless it was water 
 My conversation caught her 
 Some daddy's daughter and my mama's son 
 Said I'm acey de uno and I do know how to have fun 
 I comes from the hills 
 1 in a mil 
 2 out of 3 ain't bad 
 4 a 5 dollar bill 
 And a half a dozen thrills 
 Just see how it feels 
 7 8 9 
 Now he pre-10's (pretends) he's real 
 And she thought that was so funny 
 And she put her drink away went to pay with her money and squirted 
 All because a brother just flirted 
 And didn't know how to word it 
 I blurted out the door but she never heard it 
 Then Annalillia deserted 
 Annalillia oh Annalillia 
 Annalillia oh Annalillia 
 Annalillia oh Annalillia 
 I bet you think I'm silly huh annalillia 
 Annalillia oh Annalillia 
 Annalillia oh Annalillia 
 Annalillia oh Annalillia 
 I mean well really uh Annalillia 
 Now I was in my car when I seen Annalillia again 
 Hmm with her friend 
 Yo haven't we met before 
 Of course we have 
 We crossed paths at a local pub 
 And I was like a lickle drunk on everything I love 
 I didn't mean to run you off but I did 
 I must have put too much on it to make you pop your lid 
 But you did 
 But what you did for me physically and mentally 
 Got my chemistry just like goin' you just not knowin' 
 Well anyway ok let's try this again 
 We might as well be friends and do what friends do 
 Foxy lady brown sugar mama karma queen you 
 Don't think I'm a fiend 
 Just give me your number and I'll give you a ring 
 Tingalingaling 
 She said first of all I got a boyfriend 
 And a girlfriend 
 And a couple of rugrats and a cat 
 Splat 
 Ooh she threw me all out of my game 
 She was open like a button fly 
 So I asked myself the what and the why 
 So I said self what are you doin' 
 Why are you canoeing when you could have a motorboat instead 
 Then I told her hold her head peace 
 This ain't what I wanted 
 But right before I shook the spot I said let me tell you somethin' 
 Annalillia I'm proud to announce 
 That all balls don't bounce 
 And that's all that counts 
 I'm out 
 Annalillia oh annalillia 
 Annalillia oh annalillia 
 Annalillia oh annalillia 
 I mean well really uh annalillia
