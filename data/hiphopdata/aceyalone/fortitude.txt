I got I got I got I got 
 Fortitude, gratitude, attitude 
 Latitude 
 Longitude, horizon 
 Vertical 
 Angular, rectangular 
 Circular 
 Perpendicular, particular 
 I got I got I got nothing to lose (uh ha) and nothing to gain (uh ha) 
 And nothing from nothing don't leave a God damn thang 
 I can't win for losin' 
 Cause winnin' is strange 
 If you were born to be a loser lost and toss in the flame 
 But unfortunately what they predicted wasn't so (na uh) 
 I'm the Lone Wolf addicted to the flow I kicked it once before 
 Yeah I got that glow 
 You know when lights illuminate 
 When the atoms and the molecules accumulate I fumigate (HUH) 
 Catch my sprawled out on the skyline 
 When the mother ship crawls out the heavens y'all won't be hard to find 
 Yeah I'm out my mind but I'm in yours 
 Mr. Outsider indoors 
 I been through the war (yeah) 
 I seen many men war tryin' to read they memoirs 
 Sincerely yours 
 Mine and hers and his 
 Even the cowardly lion is tryin' to find the Wiz 
 At least I think he is 
 But I can save him a trip 
 'Cause I got more courage brains and heartbeat to make sure his don't skip 
 'Cause I'm from Cool World, Water World and the Real World 
 Worlds of fun and the world has just begun 
 And is restin' on my shoulders and it ain't no place to run 
 Now who's house? (WHO'S HOUSE?) 
 Ace One no doubt 
 I busted out to my labor of love I stay devot 
 I got I got I got height, width, weight (wait) don't forget mass 
 And class and raps for that ass and lyrical jazz 
 The inner city slash outer limit pass point of no return 
 Pass the joint don't let it burn (hold that) 
 I learn throughout my term don't be concerned (naw) 
 With these suckers don't let them latch on 
 Just keep on travelin' it'll take them way too long, to catch on 
 To this 
 I'ma diss and dismiss those who's suppose to be the bomb 
 Front 
 When they got the mic up in they palm 
 The rap game done changed everybody's on 
 We all know someone who flows and rhymin' after long 
 So call it what you wanna 
 I'm a bonafied loner and a stoner 
 Starvin' like Marvin' and Nona 
 Still bendin' corners and a proud owner of the skill 
 To get the whole party poppin' like a pill 
 I don't stop till 
 You had your fill 
 And till the sunshine starts showin' over the hill 
 Till I'm over the hill and over the hump 
 I'm a let my music bump and give the people what they want 
 'Cause I got... 
 I got I got I got showed that the world was cold 
 People was cold hearted from young to old (spit) 
 From old to young from the moon to the sun 
 From one to a billion back down to one 
 I back down to none 
 Crack down that rum 
 I grab the beatbox beat to flip it to 'em have fun 
 I got my eye on it 
 He got a three piece suit and a nice tie on it 
 Might have to fly on it 
 Go ahead and touch on it 
 Taste on it 
 Put your face on it 
 I know you want it but don't got the right component 
 Yeah I know you want it but don't got the right component 
 I'm a thunderbird thunderin' flyin' through the air and wonderin' 
 Where should I land with this wide wingspan? 
 But I ended up landin' on the same ship you commandin' 
 When I'm through expandin' I'm gonna have the whole world standin' sayin'...
