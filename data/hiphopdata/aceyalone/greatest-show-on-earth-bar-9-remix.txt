My pride and joy... 
 Okay listen up gentlemen 
 Veterans vitamins specimen Letterman 
 Tell a friend pedalin' 
 Amphetamine medicine Medalin 
 Hematology skeleton trojan velatin 
 Reverend see no evil since Solomon 
 Origin motherland 
 Must I begin babbling? 
 Amphibian oblivion 
 I'm livin' the life of ten men following a mannequin that leads you 
 Straight into a brick wall you shall fall like Berlin 
 You believe in oppression lesson learnin' Zen 
 Gatherin fondlin' oxygen 
 Wonder if this never could truly never be comprehended 
 I bled so sick when down to a mic and a pen 
 Listen 
 It's the greatest show on earth 
 Nah, it's the greatest show ever heard 
 Wanna surf my internet highway, complete with beats and words 
 On any occasion 
 My language invasion will toy with you at will 
 My spills flood country crops and small town villages 
 My image is seen through, moonstruck shadow, big screen, space station eight 
 'Faceless voice placed in timeless verbal arenas 
 While you tiptoe ballerinas step past your past I pass 
 My everlasting, spell casting, mass occultation (?) 
 You need more livation (?) 
 So drink from my hands, while you sink down into the sand 
 One allows you to take stand and then 
 You collapse and you land lifeless 
 Just mere flesh and bones 
 And some ideas that went unknown 
 No more fears, we can go home now 
 Sincerely, Aceyalone 
 I know some brothers full of hate 
 Some full of faith and some full of... 
 As I drift this animated digital state 
 My mental gets more sick 
 I have journeyed from the sperm to the germ 
 When no stone's unturned 
 From a haunting past 
 Only wanting what will last is my concern 
 It's the greatest show on earth 
 Nah, it's the greatest show on the planet 
 Can it be that you just can't see what I see 
 Granted 
 Now maybe I should warn you 
 Before I storm on you some more 
 Disarm you, reform you 
 Don't wanna harm you or alarm you 
 But nobody's leavin' here till they stop breathin' and choke 
 Ever since I was a child teethin' 
 And able to speak I spoke heathen 
 Under this tent's the greatest show ever seen ever heard 
 From the evergreen to the neverland ranch you never dreamed 
 But you slept and I witnessed it 
 It's over your head it's way outta your grasp now 
 You're outta weed outta cash outta gas and you're outta style 
 Outta place and you're outta time and you're outta touch and you're outta line 
 And you're outta turn outta tune and you're outta wind 
 And you're one outta ten who must be outta their goddamn minds 
 I'm outta reach I'm outta you're element out of the ordinary outta sight 
 I'm a outsider 
 It's outta my hands I'm outta this world on the mic 
 And this is the greatest show on earth 
 It's the greatest show in the world 
 Gotta pocket full of dirt and rocks 
 But I'm tryin' to give you this pearl 
 It's a concrete forest of course it is of course it is 
 The lamp posts are the oak trees the street tops are the streams 
 The natives stay inside their huts until that bright sun beams 
 Then slowly they crept out to get some air 
 Some argued some screamed some beamed some slept 
 Some re-tatched some wept some hobbled some betrayed 
 Some planted some begged some parted others laughed 
 Some panicked some breathed some movement by the trees (gotcha) 
 Somebody some magical logical something in the loom 
 Some whom shall I say that 
 Someone is watching every step you take 
 Some doom is waiting for you in my shed 
 Some thought some book some author's point of view 
 Some bled some bland some music by the band 
 Some danced some stood some drunk some plotted 
 Some plant some growth some joint some exotic 
 Some got it in the end and they bought the farm 
 Some dared some apple some charm some scared 
 Some hands around your neck 
 Some place some trouble some scalpel 
 Some fallin' from beginnin' to end 
 But never could understand 
 That greatest show on earth 
 It's the greatest show on earth 
 It's the greatest show in the world 
 Gotta pocket full of dirt and rocks 
 But I'm tryin' to give you this pearl 
 It's the greatest show on earth 
 It's the greatest show on the planet 
 Can it be that I just can see what you can't 
 Granted 
 It's the greatest show on earth 
 It's the greatest show ever heard 
 Wanna surf my internet highway 
 Complete with beats and words 
 It's the greatest show on earth 
 It's way beyond belivin' 
 Everybody end up coming 
 But nobody end up leavin'
