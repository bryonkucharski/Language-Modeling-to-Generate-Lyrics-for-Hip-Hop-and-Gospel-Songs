Aceyalone (spoken): 
 Excuse me, sir 
 Whose microphone is this? 
 "I think it's that guy over there" 
 This guy over here? 
 Excuse me, is this you're microphone? 
 "Yeah" 
 I mean, I've seen a lot of mcs on this microphone 
 But this is your microphone, right? 
 "Yeah, yeah, it's mine" 
 I mean, what I really wanted to know is, 
 Is this really, I mean really, really your microphone? 
 Aceyalone: 
 This microphone is mine 
 Whenever I hold it, I transcend time 
 This microphone allows me to shine 
 Bright, with the light 
 This microphone is my weapon 
 This microphone is my confidant 
 This microphone is my magical wand 
 To make all y'all, all y'all 
 I mean all y'all respond 
 Yeah 
 This microphone takes me one step beyond 
 This microphone helped to save my soul 
 This microphone helped to pave this road 
 They say "what do you do? " 
 I say "what do you mean? " 
 They say "what's your profession" 
 I say "microphone fiend" 
 This microphone is the one and only thing 
 That lets me live, lets me open up and give 
 This microphone helps me not be broke 
 This microphone helped to feed my folks 
 This microphone always keeps me awoke 
 I tell the truth and I don't tell jokes 
 Now check it 
 I tell the truth and I don't tell jokes 
 Now check it out 
 This microphone, when it's in my hand 
 With or without a band, or a mic stand 
 I command, even if it's static-y and distorted 
 I still gotta automatically record it 
 This microphone, connected to the power supply 
 My thoughts blossom, like flowers in the sky 
 This microphone... 
 P.e.a.c.e.: 
 Deactivate factor 
 We fracture microphones 
 Is that a microphone? a microphone? 
 Go on and roam, take out loans 
 If you wanna own, backpains, swallow it down 
 Live from la, it's peace and aceyalone 
 Speak rhymes over cell phones 
 Now I know you not gonna sing that song 
 Why? 'cause ain't nobody gonna understand that, homes 
 This fool is the most assured ? ? and thongs on 
 Down car phones, somebody passed out 
 With the car door opened, assed out 
 Run up on him, see what he got 
 A nice box of microphones, microphones 
 These are the same ones being slung to the clones 
 Ooh, another busted busta getting broke by the microphone... 
 Acey (spoken): 
 Okay, now I see you proved you're point 
 So now, I do have another question for you 
 "What's that? ", "why so many questions, man? " 
 I want to know, who's style is that?
