So as he stands so unaware of the fate the lies before him 
 Tunnel vision traps him in a maze 
 And in amazement, locked in a gaze 
 Caught in a phase, but it's just a stare 
 But he's just so unprepared cause the hunter seems to find you where 
 You just knew he wouldn't look 
 The moment is seized! 
 The enemies of those who were the creators of 
 Seek their just due 
 Now just due as it was written a hundred years after you 
 Submit to the will of your destiny 
 "But I control my fate!" he screams 
 As time goes trickling down his dreams 
 "If I won't let it happen, it ain't gon' happen," 
 He leaves, as he walks away 
 But what a foolish man to believe that 
 He would deceive 
 And on the eve of his day of retribution 
 Deny his execution 
 Before the hunt, the hunter has every intention of capturing his prey 
 He sets out with this in mind 
 Sometimes he'll have a plan 
 Other times he'll rely on instinct 
 And to find his catch 
 Is his only focus, and his only goal 
 The hunted on the other hand 
 Has a different mind state, but in essence the same 
 He also may or may not have a plan 
 And be forced to rely on his own instinct as well 
 All in all, both willingly and unwillingly participate in 
 The Hunt
