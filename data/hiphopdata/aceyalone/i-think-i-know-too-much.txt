 I was born into the goodness, graciousness of all mighty god 
 Faced with temptations, lies, emphasize 
 War, weapons of destruction, mayhem 
 Slaughter of the people, Satan 
 Worldly ways, godly ways, holidays, sorrow 
 No one is guaranteed tomorrow, yesterday was borrowed 
 Picture perfect sunsets, ocean front 
 Toxic waste dump, smog, clogged arteries 
 Lotteries, rechargeable batteries 
 Flattery, vanity, stars 
 Jet propelled cars, men behind bars 
 Murder, justice destruction 
 Cats that quit, setups 
 Evidence, identity, plus agility 
 Politics, revenge 
 Natural ability, idolatry, and chemistry 
 Fear, friendship, enemies and energy 
 Heat, humidities. crimes against humanities 
 Carry these, harmonies, melodies and galaxies 
 Trinities, remedies and memories are fallacies 
 I think I know too much! you don't know shit! 
 I think I know too much! you don't know shit! 
 I was born into the purest perfection of love of all mighty god 
 Faced with the sword of the truth like a lightning rod 
 City, states, countries and all abroad 
 Spacecraft all aboard 
 Convoy are destroyed 
 Books, TV, radio and telephone 
 Records, phonographs, speakers and microphones 
 Dance, cultural expression 
 Unity, neighborhood community 
 Youth and the elderly 
 Parties, battles, skills and graffiti art 
 Determination, reputation, strong and the weak at heart 
 Gods, gangsters, griots and gigolos 
 Kings, queens, bitches and silly hoes 
 Money, cars, clothes and diamond rings 
 Houses, horses, stock, the finer things 
 Food, family, future, a purpose 
 Knowledge, wisdom, understanding this circus 
 Time, travel, audio and visual 
 Creative adaptive, lonely individual 
 One nation under a groove, indivisible 
 Mind, soul, spirit and the physical 
 I think I know too much! you don't know shit!
