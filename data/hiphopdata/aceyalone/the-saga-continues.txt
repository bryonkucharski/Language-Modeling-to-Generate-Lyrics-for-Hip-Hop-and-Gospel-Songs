"Yeah, one, two 
 One, two 
 Where you at? 
 Where you goin' to? 
 What you gon' do about it? 
 What you gon' be about it? 
 Project Blowed, Abstract, Fat Jack, Aceyalone 
 Ladies and gentlemen, good people 
 Yeah, good brothers good sisters on deck 
 Dig this, peep the twist 
 Hand over fist, handstand on the cliff 
 Layin' stiff, expand on the gift 
 Uplift the masses, and pass me the spliff 
 It's a love thang, it's a hate thang 
 It's a great thang, Cali, to the state of mang 
 It's a world thing, and I'm a soldier 
 Always a war goin' on, it's never over 
 I make music, for the people 
 Who try to live a good life and keep it peaceful 
 And be resourceful, and keep achievin' 
 Every season, we represent the reason 
 I'm from the fellowship, I'm from the projects 
 I tell all access is the object 
 It's to beautiful, it's so painful 
 I do the work, and don't forget where I came from 
 The saga continues 
 On the road again 
 To different venues 
 We rescue 
 We step true 
 Because we got that soul 
 The lonely 
 The only 
 The MC's of the Project Blowed 
 What you gonna do about it? 
 What you gonna be about it?
