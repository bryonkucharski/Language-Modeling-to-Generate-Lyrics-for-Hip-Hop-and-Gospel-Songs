If it wasn't for a mic check I wouldn't have a check at all 
 - A one two, a check a one two 
 If it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all 
 - A check two, a mic a check two 
 If it wasn't for a mic check I wouldn't have a check at all 
 - A one two, a check a one two 
 If it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all 
 - A one two, and I'm a check you 
 I start most of my raps off kinda slow 
 Just so you could see exactly where it gonna go 
 I make sure your body's strapped in 
 'Cause I'ma tailspin and you're liable to get thrown 
 The bible is the microphone; I read from the scripture 
 Leave it up to you to see the pictures 
 I hover above MC's like a flying saucer 
 With the sorcery to alter the future 
 Present and the past, don't be hesitant to ask 
 Me to be the man I'll be the last 
 I'll be movin fast on that ass, I stipulate your fate 
 I take a grip I'll take a shot I'll break your plates 
 Now can you take the weight or do I have to make it lighter tighter 
 Than you could imagine that I had to been when I recite a rhyme 
 I might as well be inside of your mind 
 I know you thinkin', "Damn! How does he? What was he a man 
 Or a machine with computerized diagrams?" 
 I tell em, "Nope! I am of the flesh, fresh, dope" 
 I'm set apart you're just a shot in the dark 
 And the darkness casts no shadow 
 And I'll be victorious, no matter who I battle 
 So every rapper in the house shut the fuck up! 
 'Cause if it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all 
 - Check one, check two 
 If it wasn't for a mic check I wouldn't have a check at all 
 - Check a one two check a one two 
 If it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all 
 - A check one check two now I check you 
 Now everyone knows I got the Milk like D, homemade quilt 
 To get your wig peelt, like it should be 
 Top o' the mornin to ya, it's so many ways to do ya 
 I offer you the shield, just before I deal on ya 
 I recommend, that when I squeeze the puss from your skin 
 You pretend it ain't happenin' 
 Cause everywhere is my stompin grounds 
 When MC's stepped in I stomp 'em down to the lowest 
 You the slowest rapper that I met, but you owe us all a favor 
 Not to, jet (nah you ain't goin' nowhere) 
 Not until you show us you be flippin 
 I give your body lashes and whippins 
 T crashes the board like Pippen, I has to be trippin' 
 Not for your pleasure or your entertainment I came with 
 A crew called self, and everybody looked just like me 
 And we agreed that we dope fool 
 We got flavor and everyone knows who's the saviour 
 Cause everyone knows, everyone knows 
 Everyone knows I got flow 
 And if it wasn't for a mic check I wouldn't have a check at all 
 - A one two, a check a one two 
 If it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all 
 - A check two, a mic a check two 
 If it wasn't for a mic check I wouldn't have a check at all 
 - A one two, a check a one two 
 If it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all 
 - A one two, and I'ma check you 
 (Alternate last verse) 
 Yeah, peep this out, peep this out, peep this out... 
 This here's real life, right 
 And we are fully animated, highly intelligent, original life forms 
 Landin' in your leavin' (living) room 
 Now back up from the tell-lie-vision I need breathin' room 
 We'll be leavin' soon on a runaway brain train 
 So sustain and seckle 
 'Cause wild game can't be tamed or tackled or shackled when I echo this mic check 
 You know that 
 Can't hold back the blowed back when I flow that 
 Ooh, blew his wig back for tryin' to ride pig (piggy) back 
 Now dig that 
 I done slid back 
 Used my view finder 
 I'mma give you a reminder 
 I'm on the straight and narrow with no blinders 
 No blinders 
 But I still see the rhyme designers that bite like sidewinders 
 With ten toes down and I spin flows 'round and 'round 
 On an angle, with anger, the angular warlock-like strangler 
 Sociopathic, graphic 
 Psycho symptom: drastic 
 Plastic coated, bloated 
 Fatty tissue acid 
 I'm Jurassic I unmask it with a bread basket full of mold and yeast 
 The stench is a clencher when the gases are released 
 So inhale 
 'Cause you know you know you inhale 
 As it is in heaven 
 This is to my sistren and my brethren and it goes 
 If it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all 
 Now check one check two 
 Check one check two 
 Check one check two 
 (Fade out)
