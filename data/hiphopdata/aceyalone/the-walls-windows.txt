The walls have ears, the windows have eyes 
 And a wise man tells no lies 
 The walls have ears, the windows have eyes 
 And a dead man tells no lies 
 No lies, no lies, no lies 
 And a dead man tells no lies 
 If these walls could talk 
 They would tell you things you wouldn't believe 
 These windows have seen sights you couldn't imagine 
 And it can't be erased by Windex or a coat of paint 
 Surprise! 
 For each and every wall that ever stood it has a story 
 Some are not so obvious and some are self-explantory 
 It's padded wall in my laboratory 
 They're lookin' through the keyhole of you dormitory 
 Meanwhile, up in my observatory, my telescope sees the glory 
 And it also sees the horror and the gory they speak derogatory 
 These walls in this hotel room 
 Tell more tales about fat tales and head 
 It was heard but never said, instead the walls bleed 
 Yeah, while they bleeding 
 You could hear the couples cheating, undercover meetings 
 Behind these seedy motel walls best believe they had it all 
 Wreaking balls don't bounce against the wall 
 To make that building fall 
 The walls outside my apartment complex 
 Building projects are so complex 
 Yet they are taken all out of text 
 Like the wall of Berlin, the wall of 'Nam, the wall of China 
 And my tag on the wall as a reminder 
 Now of course the eyes are the true windows to the soul 
 As well as the window to the world's soul 
 Whether plain glass or stained glass 
 Every set of eyes has a set of windows with a set of eyes 
 Now tell me what the world would be 
 If we did not have windows (We did not have windows) 
 You would hardly ever catch the criminal or see the swindle 
 Everyone inside would need A/C when they assemble 
 A private penitentiary at home is what it might resemble 
 See my window-pane got so much pain 
 The glass is busting out the frame 
 So let the candle kindle in the window as a symbol 
 I be leavin' my window open hoping that I might get a breeze 
 But when the wind comes in the eyes 
 Come in and eyes don't seem to want to leave 
 Because spying eyes by eyeing the prize 
 And eyeing on your movement 
 You can change your wall and windows 
 With some building home improvement 
 But looky looos they still be trying 
 You look inside your window 
 The walls will hear it ever single time you voice crescendos 
 It's enough to make you tremble, leave you in limbo 
 Can it also be simple? 
 Because these are fundamentals 
 For the mental so don't get sentimental 
 Because these are not your windows 
 These wall are really rentals 
 They know everything your into 
 And all the business that you tend to 
 So keep your windows rolled up 
 And don't hold up the wall against the floor 
 And while you're window shopping 
 Don't bother stopping at my store 
 I put a note in the window, but you couldn't read what is said 
 So I took a rock and carved it in the glass and it read:
