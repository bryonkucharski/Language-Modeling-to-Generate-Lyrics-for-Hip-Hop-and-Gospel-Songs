 This goes to all you ugly rappers, pretty rappers 
 Big city rappers, country rappers, greedy rappers 
 Itty-bitty rappers, witty rappers, two-for-fiddy rappers 
 Hello-kiddie rappers, Frank Nitty rappers and [edited] rappers 
 All you dapper rappers, young whippersnapper rappers 
 Gun clapper rappers, fun rappers, Gamma Kappa rappers 
 Gum rappers, idiotic rappers, psychotic rappers 
 Melodic rappers and narcotic rappers 
 All you phoney rappers, baloney rappers 
 Me-and-my-homie rappers 
 Tony Toni rappers and all that, yeah 
 All you hood rappers, misunderstood rappers 
 Think-it's-all-good rappers 
 Let me tell y'all somethin' 
 Look... I just wanna work it all out 
 I just want everybody to do they thing and be cool 
 Be who they are, you know 
 First thing you should know is I'm not afraid 
 Every rapper has the potential to be laid 
 Down on his or her back 
 When I'm down on my luck I get down on the track 
 I clown on the rappers sort of like Barnum and Bailey's 
 My stardust-bust is bigger and brighter than Hailey's 
 Comet, I vomit up the astronomic on the daily 
 Peel the steel skin off the mic and do a scaley 
 The think rapper to shrink-rap that rapper 
 And sink that boat of his 
 My rap motor is a million mega-cycles 
 My rap folder is a megaton and higher than the Eiffel 
 Tower with sniper rifle power 
 To blow off your melon and it ain't no tellin' 
 All you heard was rappers yellin' 
 My lyrics start propellin 
 I get to wellin on 'em from the dome 
 After I trail 'em home 
 I like to catch 'em alone and STRANGLE 'em with the microphone 
 And drag 'em back to Project Blowed 
 Hold as many mics as I can possibly hold 
 And rip up the session after the last rapper flowed 
 I never fold, even though my pokerface is old 
 The world's cold, probably why I stay in battle mode 
 I would love to touch your ego 
 European, latin or negro 
 Rap Evil Knievel, but I ain't evil 
 It's all nice, especially with the mic device 
 When it's in my hand it's like throwin' the trick dice 
 It's the worldwide underground heist 
 And what I'ma give back is more than suffice 
 Pour me over ice and drink to think 
 You're only as strong as your weakest - 
 I dwell amonst the deepest 
 As long as there's speakers I make songs for the peoples 
 I push the ink, who gives a f[edited] what they think 
 It's tight now, wait until I iron out the kinks 
 It's tied down, wait until I iron out the kinks 
 ...Wait until I iron it all out, it's gon' be cool 
 But like I said I want everybody to be able to do they thing successfully 
 This goes out to all you shallow rappers 
 Bottom-of-the-bottle rappers 
 Spit-and-swallow rappers, hollow rappers 
 Love-to-follow rappers, Apollo rappers 
 And rah-rah rappers, yeah, all that, yeah 
 To all you Big Willie rappers, silly rappers 
 'My-mack-milli' rappers, smoke-a-Philly rappers 
 Illy-illy, killy-killy rappers 
 Not really rappers 
 Yeah, all you signed rappers 
 Blind-to-what's-goin-on-behind rappers 
 Crime rappers, 'I'm-in-my-prime' rappers 
 Part-time rappers, one of a kind rappers, too 
 Yeah, you wanna go around the world, but you gotta have ??? 
 You wanna paint a perfect picture but ain't got no paint 
 But I'm the painter with the brush and the easel 
 I like to rush 'em and I hit 'em with the ??fleezle?? 
 I got a stick of dynamite, you got a stick of gum 
 He tried to chew it up before I blew it up, it's done 
 It's done, it's done, it's done...
