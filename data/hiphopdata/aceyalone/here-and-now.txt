When I first splashed out the water, it was all wet 
 Covered in blood, mama covered with sweat 
 The umbilical cord wrapped around my neck 
 Chokin' me, doctor pushin' me and pokin' me 
 I said to the motherfuckin' nurse "You must be jokin' me" 
 Ten fingers, ten toes like it's supposed to be 
 Thank god it ain't no coke in me 
 That's what my momma spoke to me 
 She said, "Son, your uzi weighs a ton" 
 The world for you has just begun, now go Darien have some fun 
 But don't abuse time on earth 'cause time's worth more than gold 
 The here is here and the now is now and the world is hell and cold 
 So off into the street I strode 
 I think I'm supposed to take your head as far as I was told 
 It's a shake-shake of the dice, you should take-take my advice 
 You dealin' with snakes and mice, that means you can't win 
 But losin' I'd never have trouble choosin', 'cause what I'm gon' use 'em 
 If it ain't worth doin' now, it ain't worth doin' at all 
 I ain't bullshittin' wit y'all 
 Your life is here and now 
 No need to beat your brow 
 These moments won't belong to you, tomorrow 
 Well here I am, here I stand, here I be 
 Behind this mic tryin'a set my life free 
 Let my shit be testimony of a G 
 Who seen sights that other people just couldn't see 
 They say "Where you wanna do it?" I say "Here" 
 They say "When you wanna do it?" I say "Now" 
 They say "How?" I say "With my style, one of the few things I got in this world 
 My family, a couple friends, my beautiful baby girl" 
 And procrastination, lack of motivation in your operation 
 I'm sorry but I just don't have the patience 
 You'll never get a second chance to dance 
 While you sit on your hands, we spit out the jams for the fans 
 And I'm so far advanced, I had to bring it back some 
 And I said fuck it, let's take it to the maximum 
 Like walking with your legs broken, mic spoken 
 Arms draggin, staggerin' and laughin', here and now 
 I don't cry later, I put it down now, I don't wanna try later 
 I seize the time, the eves from behind 
 I freeze-frame the game for the grind, I came for your mind 
 Not for the fame, but the deaf, dumb, and blind 
 'Cause everybody's gonna get just what come to 'em 
 Find your God, and run to 'em 
 I wanna talk now, no you can't call me back 
 You're too anxious, yeah, you could call me that 
 I wanna eat now 'cause there the food right there 
 No I can't wait, I just want my fair share 
 So where the food at? Call all the shots at 
 "Patience is a virtue," Yeah man, I got that 
 But my clock reads half past a monkey's ass 
 And a quarter to his balls, and it's moving fast 
 I just wish some people wouldn't dick around 
 'Cause I want it here and now, I can't stick around 
 Yeah, so I probably won't be in the lobby 
 Waitin' for Bobby to give me a jobby-jobby 
 Hey Simo, primo, Kemo-sabe 
 Knees knobby, but stand firm, not wobbly 
 So where we at? ight here, when time is a now 
 Motherfuck the day, motherfuck the trial
