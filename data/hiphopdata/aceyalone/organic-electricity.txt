(Uncredited spoken word poets form the song's intro) 
 "After a week of smoky nothingness.." 
 {*Voice SLOWED down* ".. the stars had returned" 
 "The mountains were blue now, and purple along the upper reaches" 
 {*SLOWED again* "And as the sun left off, 
 The moon took up her reign over the true blue spaces." 
 "It was very solemn." 
 (Aceyalone) 
 As I stand in place, as the center of my galaxy 
 I am, organic electricity 
 My eyelids expose - the circumfrence 
 My mind tends to bend - irreverant! 
 Unparalleled - chaotic! 
 My fairy tale - psychotic 
 Lifespan - infinity 
 I am, ORGANIC ELECTRICITY 
 Equality and harmony - transmit 
 Contact shockwave - I'M HIT! 
 Program exchange - compute 
 Reformat hard drive - comply 
 Quantum leap time travel - exist 
 Exiting the exodus - connect 
 Brainchild nucleus - reality 
 I am, ORGANIC ELECTRICITY 
 All that has ever been - I shall be 
 And all that will come to be - I will become 
 God word radiate - authenticity 
 I am, ORGANIC ELECTRICITY 
 Cocooned in ignorance, silence and darkness 
 Blessed with intelligence, keenness and sharpness 
 To explore the seamless dreamless nightmarish illusion 
 Enhanced by your perception but, no conclusion 
 Mainframe access - DENIED 
 Password G.O.D. - supplied 
 Universal guidance - odyssey 
 I am, ORGANIC ELECTRICITY 
 Divining at the power source - intensity 
 I am, ORGANIC ELECTRICITY 
 Beauty of the inner pain - experience 
 Struggle of the forces - serious 
 Stargate pathway - enlightened 
 Thought process - engaged 
 Completing composition but imperfect intuition 
 I orbit in position, gravitational suspension 
 Past the 3rd and 4th and 5th dimensions 
 The extensions of, the pieces of, the essence of this power 
 And carve the earth, mountains, land and seas 
 Rivers, lakes and valleys, and deserts 
 YOUR EYES'LL NEVER HOLD IT ALL AT ONCE - just the small pleasures 
 My everlasting backspin, around the solar system-atic 
 AUTOMATIC CONTROLLER, fold in place by space and time 
 Tear down the walls of nothing 
 We are all full of individuals and independencies 
 'Cause I am, organic electricity 
 As I sit in place, as the center of my galaxy 
 I am, organic electricity 
 My eyelids extends - the circumfrence 
 My mind tends to bend - irreverant! 
 Unparalleled - chaotic! 
 My fairy tale - psychotic 
 Lifespan - infinity 
 I am, ORGANIC ELECTRICITY 
 Contact shockwave - I'M HIT! 
 Equality and harmony - transmit 
 Program exchange - compute 
 Reformat hard drive - comply 
 Quantum leap time travel - exist 
 Exit to the exodus - connect 
 Brainchild nucleus - reality 
 I am, ORGANIC ELECTRICITY 
 All that has ever been - I shall be 
 And all that will come to be - I will become 
 God word radiate - authenticity 
 I am, ORGANIC ELECTRICITY
