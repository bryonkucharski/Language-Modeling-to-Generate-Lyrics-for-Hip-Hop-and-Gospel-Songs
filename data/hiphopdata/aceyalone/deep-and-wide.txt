Breath out breath in breath out 
 There's a MC flowin' deep and wide deep and wide 
 Rhymes I got plenty keep 'em right by my side 
 Come and get a flow jump inside the boat for the ride 
 There's a MC flowin' deep and wide deep and wide 
 Now everybody up odd man in 
 Fit to play a game of Russian roulette and God's fit to win 
 I hope you're equip for the adventure men to the front 
 And the women and children to the back of the boat 
 Fit to be afloat in about fifty seconds 
 Better believe we brought enough free chicken for the picnic 
 And while the time is tickin' 
 Automated belt drive felt tip scribe I'm your guide 
 To the innermost outtermost post to the other side 
 Now my body is my temple and my temple is my prize 
 And my mind shine like the sun do 
 And here's a little word from the wise 
 You go up the river down the creek cross the lake 
 And over the stream tryin' to escape this MC 
 There's a MC flowin' deep and wide deep and wide 
 - What is it 
 MC's flowin' deep and wide deep and wide 
 Rhymes we got plenty keep 'em right by our sides 
 Come and get a flow jump inside the boat for the ride 
 There's a MC flowin' deep and wide deep and wide 
 - What is it 
 Obviously this happens periodically 
 It's not me it's the god in me I'm rappin' so melodically 
 Aeronautically Aaron is I, Aaron is high, Aaron is flying 
 Why in me means the glare in your eye 
 They're in the lyin' down position 
 The music's a masseuse 
 Goin' through your body makin' all the tension loose 
 Audio boost their reaction means satisfaction 
 Seems to happen when I'm rappin' and they hear me clearly 
 And cheering even teary-eyed in the b-boy kingdom 
 We some rude stylish scattin rappin' world twists 
 But that's just for audio analysis 
 The dopest you diagnose this 
 But still don't get too close this 
 May have a ferocious side 
 There's and MC flowin' by deep and open wide 
 - What is it 
 MC's flowin' deep and wide deep and wide 
 Rhymes we got plenty keep 'em right by our sides 
 Come and get a flow jump inside the boat for the ride 
 There's a MC flowin' deep and wide deep and wide 
 - What is it 
 Breath out breath in breath out 
 - Yo Ab feel the wind blowin' 
 Breath in breath out 
 Breath in breath out 
 I am a universal soldier
