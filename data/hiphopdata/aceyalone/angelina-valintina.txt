She-devil 
 And she was ghetto 
 Dirty as the bottom of her high-heeled stilettos 
 I couldn't believe she got as far as she got 
 And fresh food gone, rotten 
 Angelina valintina 
 A bad girl 
 A trick 
 A lover, a fighter 
 A cold-hearted bitch 
 Running through the times, leave this shit behind 
 She wasn't even fine, she was average 
 But everybody love the way her titties and her assets 
 She was the classic hoe that you love to hate 
 Maybe that you love to date 
 That can make a man break 
 Get in close and then flip like a pancake 
 She todl lies the same ones told to her 
 She was out to get everything she thought was over her 
 And if you show to her any sign of weakness, 
 She'll stab you in your back and leave you speechless 
 Angelina valintina 
 She kinda figured that she'll fuck her way to the top 
 Not a bad idea for a girl who got what she got 
 But not just the body the brains 
 Rob steel sex appeal it's all the same 
 She had a way of spitting game better than most dudes 
 Soon as you get close to her heart you was old news 
 That's how she rose through 
 A thorn on a rose who had horns on that head 
 And did exactly what the hoes do 
 She was up for sale 
 Even went to jail 
 Go through her man's mail, looking through his handheld 
 Well you could tell she was a filthy young hooker 
 Her mind state was crooked that's why everybody shook her 
 But that's why everybody loved and respected her 
 Daddy neglected her mama rejected her 
 So she lived by the code on the street 
 Man to man 
 Plan to plan 
 Her life was cheap 
 Wicked foul poisonous vixen black widow little girl who's your next victim 
 Madam redemption sexual tension 
 Heaven in between the walls of the fifth dimension 
 Voodoo woman who do you love 
 Besides your own bullshit what are you thinking of 
 Other than the surface shallow end of the pool 
 Throw you like a dirty birdy high off a super cool 
 Now who's the stupid fool her or the one she trapped 
 Long walk to the top stepping on people's backs 
 Angelina valentina don't know how to act 
 There she come there she go I can't believe she did that 
 One man's queen is one man's slut 
 And one girl's dream is blind and twisted up 
 She never really knew her own purpose in life 
 Part-time hoe part-time wife
