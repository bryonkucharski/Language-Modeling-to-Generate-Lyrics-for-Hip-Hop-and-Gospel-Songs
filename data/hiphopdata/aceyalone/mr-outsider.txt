I am a universal soldier walkin' in the path of the Math 
 After the aftermath I'm a still be a soldier in America's blood bath 
 Look at it through the wrath of a universal soldier you could never monitor my 
 Craft 
 I am not a graft I am a original soldier walkin' in the path of the Math 
 Now 
 You're gettin' outside yourself boy you're gettin' outside yourself - is 
 That right 
 You're gettin' outside yourself boy you're gettin' outside yourself - uh huh 
 You're gettin' outside yourself boy you're gettin' outside yourself - uh 1 2 
 You're gettin' outside yourself boy you're gettin' outside yourself - ooh 
 Well I scrapes the neighbourhoods lookin' for odd jobs 
 It's hard livin' like God in a world full of bobs 
 John doe's and jacks joe's and mary mack's 
 I guess babylon wasn't made for blacks now was it 
 Well it doesn't really matter does it 
 Cause it be dependin' on the who what why's and the whereabouts 
 And I'm a nigger that the world don't care about 
 Mr outsider 
 It's all about bein' a fighter 
 Use the guide to open up your mind a little wider 
 My mellow my ace 
 Movin' from place to place all a nigger want is a taste 
 Working on the docks wearin' a smock 
 I clock in I clock out about 5 o'clock 
 I keeps a calm disposition 
 So I won't arouse suspicion 
 But then I know what you're wishin' 
 That you could put a bullet in my head plate w/out all that red tape 
 And lead me straight to the grave 
 You're either a slave or Jesus got you saved 
 Or you don't know how to behave but you're brave 
 A mixed up African w/a fingerwave 
 And the load ain't gettin' no lighter 
 Even though I'm in it to win it I'm still a outsider 
 Well back in the days they told me hip hop pays 
 So I says I strays aways from L.A.'s average 
 Cause C.k-in' and B.k-in'* was bein' a savage (* referring to Crips and Bloods 
 Maybe?) 
 And M.C.-in' and DJ-in' was bringin' the cabbage 
 Now it ain't like a nigger talking hella late in the game 
 I'm talkin' '80 ace deuce 
 Nobody think about truce 
 No Menace no Boys In The Hood no Juice 
 It was more like Coolie<sp> High and 
 Niggers truly die like they do 
 When I found out you got to choose your path I knew 
 Not red and blue 
 The blackness is true 
 My tactics was new 
 That's when the practice grew and I flew 
 I wanted to be a rapper so simple and plain 
 From Los Angeles city of the big bang theory 
 Where everyone is leery 
 Now a whole mess of MC's fear me 
 But it's important everybody hear me 
 As I tell you about the unwanted man who got blunted and took what he can 
 And he ran 
 From city to city and town to town 
 Bouncin' around like he's about to blow the world up 
 Cause his mind's not dormant anymore his door's ajar 
 And his jar's full of somethin' else 
 Now everyone knows that scarecrows w/velcro hair ain't real 
 Yeah 
 But if your psyche is likely to be spilled 
 Ain't no tellin' 
 You'll be sailin' across the seas like Magellan 
 Way out your range and since I don't speak greek stranger 
 I'm a (?let me?) give it to you in layman's terms so you'll learn 
 I paid the piper I'm gon' pick the tune 
 But I don't listen to music like that 
 So 
 You're gettin' outside yourself boy you're gettin' outside yourself - is that 
 Right 
 You're gettin' outside yourself boy you're gettin' outside yourself - uh huh 
 You're gettin' outside yourself boy you're gettin' outside yourself - uh 1 2 
 You better run and hide yourself boy cause you can't provide for self 
 Inside outside 
 That's what doin' it is all about right 
 Inside outside inside outside 
 That's what doin' it is all about 
 Now I'm a outsider but not like ponyboy 
 I'm Aceyaloney boy 
 And I transcend 
 ?W/both hands in? 
 And I transfer the answer from w/in 
 And I strain and I gain the strength to bust a blood vessel 
 As my dirty thoughts mudwrestle in my head muscle 
 You got your lucky charm I know you believe in warlocks 
 You better be keepin' you door locked and bolted 
 Say praise the lord as I raise the sword and revolted 
 Psychological warfare for the holy 
 Smoke your last bowl-y 
 Your little ship a capsizes your rap dies slowly 
 Got a good old fashion passion for smashin' what they built 
 W/no guilt 
 At full tilt 
 At full speed 
 At full blast 
 Comin' full circle on that ass 
 I'm the idealistic realistic mystic from the past 
 That just gets more intelligent 
 Don't risk it I'm fast 
 Better get involved don't know how the world revolves and evolves 
 And solve all that you can solve before your mind dissolves 
 Now who kilt (killed) this lion? curiosity 
 Now why's the black man dyin' it's an atrocity 
 Does history really repeat itself or is it phophecy? 
 So until I leave my physical shell there ain't no stoppin' me 
 'Cause I paid the piper 
 I'm gon' pick the tune 
 But I don't listen to music like that 
 So
