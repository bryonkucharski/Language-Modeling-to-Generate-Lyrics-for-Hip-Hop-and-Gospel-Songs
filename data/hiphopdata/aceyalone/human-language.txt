Aceyalone: 
 Every time I flow I get this vision and I know 
 Every time I know I manifest and then I grow 
 Everywhere I go I plant a seed I hope it grow 
 But every seed planted ain't always granted life though 
 Some grow slower then they flourish in the end 
 Then again some go fast then they die out soon as they began 
 Now many music on my seed 
 Planted in the minds to feed 
 Yes indeed I cut off bleed 
 I sweat in tears until I'm free 
 My set for the 213 
 Wit protect to the e-y-e 
 Just soak it in like mother earth 
 Who was once this jewel 
 Is just a cesspool for fools 
 Truly world there's another chapter to that never ending capture rapture 
 I tap yo mental 
 And strokes ya mind so gentle 
 I'm the sunshine not the star and I rhyme irregular and bizarre 
 But I no exactly who I are 
 Ye... and I love keepin' true and not off guard 
 Nobody likes to be a waterboy foreva 
 Neva seein the field thinkin' you got it together 
 Playin' foosball in the street its yo game but its they concrete 
 It's my ball it's my treat an it's my world it's my hit 
 And I live a hell hole in the wall and I don't never see the light of day 
 So flipnos controlling alla y'all but they won't take mines away 
 What is that instict 
 To react before you think and make that thought complete tell it to the weak 
 Smell before you eat 
 See I neva try to mislead 
 And I walk this planet keyed 
 Yes indeed I cut off bleed 
 I sweatin tears until I'm free 
 My set to the 213 
 My protect to the e-y-e 
 Just soak it in despite all this anguish 
 For a book of human language 
 The lion will never ever lie down with the lamb 
 That's how its taught when I sought out to tell them who I am 
 I exam 
 I loot for the bank and swam 
 Change my program 
 But they hold me back like water in a dam 
 But I won't be held 
 Even though I'm trailed with bread crumbs 
 Ill take 'em to the max headroom 
 You'll need more then excedrin 
 Codina 
 Morphina 
 Nicotina 
 Caffeine in yo cantine 
 In yo bloodstream 
 Ima well oiled machine keep my area quarantined 
 From the gardens of florentine to shores of tripoli 
 Scientifically ain't to rippen me I'm terrifically well spoken 
 See many attempts to get a glimpse of what the hell I'm smoking 
 But it ain't no bamma 
 I just mastered this bastard grammar 
 I go outside my perimeter and stretch out my diameter 
 It gets bigger than gamera so picture that wit your camera 
 My st-eez-amina and st-eez-yle and st-eez-ory as a child 
 Ain't much more harsh than yours 
 I just express mines a little different 
 Cause life ain't fair but who really cares? 
 I know some people that's over here but they wanna be over there 
 I know some real cool cats ya but they wanna be bears an when I see 'em chasing chickens I get heated like a flare 
 On your face looks scared ye space suit's got a tear 
 You're a square and I'm beyond comparen I'm rare ya 
 And I'm sick of turning apples into pears 
 Soon as I get a little bit of it ima share 
 See I never try to mislead and I walk this planet keyed 
 Yes indeed I cut I bleed 
 I sweatin tears until I'm free 
 My set to the 213 
 My protect to the e-y-e 
 Just soak it in despite all this anguish 
 For a book of human language
