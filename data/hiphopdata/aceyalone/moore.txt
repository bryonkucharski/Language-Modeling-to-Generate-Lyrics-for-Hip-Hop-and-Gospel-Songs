More and more and more and more... 
 Just a little bit more 
 Just a little bit more 
 Just a tiny bit more 
 More and more and more and more... 
 They always want a little more than they got 
 Never take a little when they always take a lot 
 Didn't any want more 'cause they never stop 
 You always on the bottom and they always on the top 
 They know what to say, you face 'em every day 
 Always got a place for you in case you wanna play 
 A fire in the hole couldn't chase 'em away 
 They come around and take it all and never wanna stay 
 Gotta have extra, add to the texture 
 I don't want a lecture but that's a nice gesture 
 Need a bigger portion put it on my plate 
 Gluttony and suddenly there's nothin' else to take 
 Less is more unless you poor 
 Gimme everything and leave a mess on the floor 
 Want the best score and the rest of yours 
 They forge and the gorge and they whore just a little bit... 
 More and more and more and more... 
 Just a little bit more 
 Just a little bit more 
 Just a tiny bit more 
 More and more and more and more... 
 No they not satisfied no it's not enough 
 Make mine bigger pile it up to the roof 
 Over your head I need more bread 
 Even my ego needs to be fed 
 Locked and load headed for the war zone 
 I need more stones to crush more bones 
 Greedy and lust for 'em must have been known 
 We only want everything leave us alone 
 Want you to give up more than you ever did before 
 Open doors so I never get bored 
 It's never too many, gimme gimme gimme 
 Come on down my chimney and gimme somethin' good 
 Add somethin' to it super size kick it up a notch 
 Gimme everything that you got in your stock 
 Make it a double I don't want trouble 
 I'm takin' all the rest of these don't look puzzled 
 More and more and more and more... 
 Just a little bit more 
 Just a little bit more 
 Just a tiny bit more 
 More and more and more and more... 
 It's perfectly normal to not have morals 
 No more talented they want every morsel 
 Who is the mortal I see every mornin 
 With more than a little bit he must be important 
 No I'm not surprised you want more fries 
 You wanna be formally immortalized 
 Mortified at the borderline 
 Cause this moron got more than mine 
 I need morphine, I want more things 
 The mortgage is due and I need more green 
 To get more high, bye bye bye 
 Take it or steal it or get it with a lie 
 An eye for an eye, make it more wide 
 I need more room when I jump the ride 
 There's more than enough more stuff I can hide 
 I need all mines in an endless supply
