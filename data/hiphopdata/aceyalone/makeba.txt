This is not a love ballad but it is a slow song 
 (?) Tell you 'bout this girl I know well this girl I used to know 
 Her name's 
 Makeba

 Yo how you doin' baby it's been a long time 
 Haven't seen you in a couple of years and the last I heard you lost your mind 
 Well how you been who you been with how's it been goin' 
 Still into hip hop are you still flowin' 
 Oh yeah that's cool 
 We should kick back maybe have a session 
 I remember you tellin' me you had to get away couldn't stay another day 
 In the life of l.a. in the city 
 That's peace 
 Yo where you been china Africa greece 
 Least you coulda dropped me a letter or a phone call 
 Let me know you was all right 
 Your friends and your family and they kept tellin' me 
 Makeba disappeared in the night 
 Now I know that you had big dreams makeba 
 But I had big dreams too 
 And all this time you were searchin' makeba 
 Did any your dreams come true 
 I remember I used to be down for you and you was down for me 
 I had your back and you had my back makeba 
 I wanted you to be my g 
 Makeba 
 Yo you know I got another girl after that right 
 She kinda looked like you too a little bit 
 Sweet makeba 
 Yo why don't you just come to the crib you know 
 We could listen to some music talk about things 
 Ooh I see you're not a young girl anymore and you're all grown up 
 And you been around the world 
 Wanna see what life's gonna offer you it's your young world and it's all for 
 You 
 You probably got a man in every country that wants you 
 Like I wanted you but you didn't want that 
 Remember how we used to make love makeba 
 'Member how you loved it when I hit it from the back 
 Makeba 
 I had love for you 
 I had wanted you 
 I had needed you 
 I remember comin' to your house seven in the morning 
 Ready for school but we didn't even go 
 It was right back to my house where we kissed liked kids 
 And we jumped in the bed and you know 
 I loved makin' love to my makeba 
 She was like my queen of sheba 
 I remember how we used to smoke chiba 
 Oh you don't smoke no more well that's cool 
 Well everybody gotta stop sometime 
 I remember one time when you hid my stash and saved my ass from the one time 
 I remember some fools tried to jump me and you jumped up before anybody did 
 We used to say if and when we get married we'll have kid after kid after kid 
 After kid 
 After kid after kid after kid after kid after kid 
 Damn that's a lot of kids 
 Makeba 
 Sweet makeba 
 I had love for you 
 I had wanted you 
 I had needed you 
 How I loved makin' love to my makeba 
 Well remember how the whole crew used to hang tough 
 Well everybody's doin' they thang and stuff 
 And everybody's still actin' like they know 
 And a few more people ain't w/us no mo' 
 Oh me I'm just chillin' 
 Makin' my music livin' and buildin' 
 Tryin' to make a million out this little ol' dime and this nickel 
 And lickin' lickle shots for the prophets we forgot 
 But other than that I'm glad you back on deck 
 I expect to see you in the near future 
 If you wanna just sit and chat talk about the good old days 
 Good old times what was in style what's goin' on now 
 Cause it has been a while 
 Makeba 
 Honey girlfriend 
 Left in a whirlwind put a brother in a tailspin 
 Just twirlin' 
 Had a few laughs and kicks 
 But me and my clique don't be trippin' no tricks 
 I still got a piece of me to give you 
 You still got a piece of you to give me 
 You listenin' but you don't hear me 
 We can pick up right where we left at but 
 I gotta be me and you gotta accept that 
 I just wanna be homies 
 'Cause I ain't got love like monie 
 Cause soon as you got close you got ghost 
 And you tried to leave acey 'lone-y 
 So hook up w/me if you can cool 
 But you know I know what you get loose to 
 And if you play your cards right get your shit tight 
 Then we might be down like we used to 
 Makeba
