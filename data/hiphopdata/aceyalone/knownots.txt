This goes out to everybody in the whole wide world 
 Fresh coast gettin' rowdy 
 We don't represent out west we signifyin' 
 We showin' out 
 And we about to tell y'all what it's all about 
 So as I ease back from this microphone 
 I'm a let it go to aceyalone 
 Little somethin' like this 
 Check it out people whoever you are 
 Whoever you with where ever you at 
 Where ever you from where ever you goin' 
 I'm 'on' put you up on this here cause youse not knowin' 
 Verse one: 
 Let me take a little time out to holler at ya 
 You go get your partners 'cause I'm fit to drop a bug in your ear 
 See what we have here is uh ruh yeah 
 The helluva ill type shit you fear 
 That's 'cause we knowin' but you don't really know 
 Cause every nigga that call hisself rappin' don't really flow 
 Really though 
 I'll open up my mind and take you places you can't go 
 I woulda been a catcher behind the plate but you can't throw 
 Cause you don't know but you don't hear me though 
 Yo check this out 
 My body collapse in the raps 
 And snaps like a wild mongoose in a trap 
 Better watch your table manners boy and give me room 
 I'm servin' shit constantly tune 
 And laughin' like a ticklish babboon 
 On the way to the moon w/a stick and a broom 
 And the cream of the crop hip hop 'cause we be 
 Crackin' the whip on the poppin' be pimpin' the whole punk block 
 At the junk shop 
 Fellowship shop shape sha-bob-a-lob-a 
 Sloppin' the side of a pig pen with the grape ape babboon 
 Wanna see this jack o'lantern panted planted ball that don't bounce 
 Against the wall like you think 
 Well thanks but no thanks 
 Pranks or no pranks 
 I'm a let 'em know they can't rank bank or no bank 
 I would if I could but I can't so I ain't gon' stop flowin' 
 But I'll put you up on this here 'cause you's not knowin' 
 Damn acey flay me he kinda hittin' I ain't bullshittin' 
 Written into the fellowship you know freestyle 
 Meanwhile back at the hall of justice 
 Abstract bust this this track ain't for suckers 
 Verse two: abstract rude 
 Immediately exceeding the reality of normality 
 By radically and automatically startin' off rapidly 
 Rap w/me 
 Come on perk a little work a little 
 In the middle nuclei we are responding 
 Stimuli dim the lights 
 I gotta really grab you 
 Cause you just not knowin' about flowin' I can climax to 
 You rap too short too long too slow too fast 
 You lacks on point you wrong you won't last 
 I'm up on a good foot you're out on a bad note 
 I'm dope 
 Ice 
 Fresh 
 Automatic oh yes 
 Creatively talkin' about how I'm fadin' you vocally 
 Your mouth's not openin' man you just not knowin' damn 
 These niggas got me fucked up aw what up abstract rude 
 Rap dude ain't nobody fade the fresh coast 
 You know them heavyweights you know what I'm sayin' 
 That ganja k you know what I'm sayin' 
 That dolla holla comin' w/that watts up you know what I'm sayin' 
 It's like I ain't even tryin' to understand why people comin' at me 
 W/that nonsense 
 They ain't knowin' 
 Verse three: aceyalone 
 See I engineered it I geared it I steered it 
 I took it to the whole world and everybody cheered it 
 I hauled it I yes y'all'ed it and they feared it 
 I called it I outlawed it and they cleared it 
 Now I am I and it is it and that's that 
 But ain't that a bitch 
 It ain't shit 
 Think it ain't all that that they say 
 Forever and a day 
 To live and die in l.a. 
 California u.s.a. 
 But I am a universal soldier 
 Ok 
 Walkin' through the party tryin' to find my way 
 Bumped into my main man ganja k 
 I gave a nigga a pound and he lit up a j 
 I took a hit and a half and got high and a hey 
 My coconut was mellow but my vision was gray 
 Looked on the dance floor and I seen my DJ 
 Cool hands kiilu grand he knows what to play 
 So we headed for the booth to get the party on the way 
 Walkin' through the crowd I heard somebody say hey 
 It was mikah 9 he said what up double a 
 Tryin' to make my pay tryin' not to stray 
 But you know my forte I let a sleepin' dog lay 
 We on that old missin' link 
 In between the baboon and the common man 
 They don't understand tho 
 They ain't even tryin' to know 
 Check this out 
 Verse four: mikah 9 
 I and I echo with old sentiments 
 Rudimentary tenements 
 House reverberates 
 Richochets to small invertebrates 
 Even all these spineless jellyfish 
 Rhyme-less bass with no taste jazz 
 Enthusiastic spastic hemophiliacs 
 Memorabilia or acting siliac sense (less) milia 
 Minature expenditures 
 Spine tingling adventures 
 Keenly architectures 
 Of a lecture 
 That blockade and bust dental caps and dentures 
 Hey! let's start a new business venture 
 No you're not dreaming I'll be the pincher 
 The millimeter by millimeter doberman boombastic mix 
 Where rotweiller while a rhyme of 
 Graffiti traffic autobiographic 
 Ethnic cleansing benzing lacing 
 Culture oscars inch by inch deans and costners 
 Who foster my rhythmic memories 
 Collectible sacks of my mossberg and telebeam 
 Scope enemies with enemas 
 I'm leaving them helpless and hopeless like the 
 Running victim that falls in the scary cinema 
 Huh huh it was like three black guys and they like had skills 
 Yeah skills 
 They were like kinda kinda funky and fresh and stuff 
 Yeah nigga you just not knowin'
