Oh man I got a splittin' headache 
 And my heart is broken up into a thousand tiny little microscopic pieces 
 I got a head full of headaches a heart that's full of woes 
 I'm constantly singin' them downhome blues and not many people knows 
 That leaves me with a twisted view of the whole wide world as I know it 
 And I guess I got no choice but to be a poet 
 Verse one: 
 Now in my natural habitat I gravitate towards having that 
 And I elevate on having that 
 And I'll never get caught in your rabbit trap 
 From yellowstone to venezuela 
 Nigeria down through australia 
 There's somethin' I learned that I gotta tell ya 
 There's a whole lot of us ain't wrapped too tight 
 Now I could been your doctor or your lawyer 
 Or come to your house and clean up for ya 
 Self destruction won't destroy ya 
 If you got somebody that's lookin' out for ya 
 Men are murdered women raped 
 People gettin' beat on videotape 
 And people elsewhere tryin' to escape 
 Just to come to America to lick the plate 
 Helicopters scope the land 
 Hell is here so I hope you 'stand 
 Hip-hop culture is African 
 And rappers like me gon' rule the earth 
 Verse one: 
 Now everyday I manifest and I generate and smoke cannabis 
 And I penetrate and I innovate and I demonstrate from los angeles 
 From amsterdam to the northern border 
 Panama Spain to atlanta georgia 
 Somethin' I learned that I haven't told ya 
 Brothers like me don't live too long 
 Now I know you know it ain't who you know but do you know you 
 See cause you could go just like any joe and that's for sho' true 
 So if you're straight and you're narrow and the snake's in the barrel 
 And the serpent is under the rainbow 
 And you're head over heels instead of the reals 
 Then you're bound to be tangled 
 Cause brothers are singin' and dancin' and rappin' 
 Like they was a vaudeville act 
 But knowledge is wealth and you gotta know self 
 And you gotta know god's still black 
 Cause every so often I sit and I wonder why I even trip at all 
 Cause half are down when I get down 
 The other half wanna see me fall 
 Waitin around all heaven bound and you seen that your l-7's round 
 And when the sky falls to the ground 
 And you found that the only way up is down 
 Don't give me no additives no sedatives or preservatives 
 Or repetitive rhetoric you give 
 Just let it live 
 Yet my head is poundin' I'm dealin' with this load on my mind 
 I got a head full of headaches a heart that's full of woes man 
 I'm constantly singin' them downhome blues and not many peoples knows man 
 That leaves me with a twisted view of the whole wide world as I know it 
 And I guess I got no choice but to be a 
 I got no choice but to be 
 I guess I got no choice but to be a poet 
 I guess I got no choice but to be a prophet 
 I guess I got no choice but to be a griot 
 A gangster 
 A athlete 
 A bum 
 A nobody 
 A criminal 
 A convict 
 A black man 
 A MC 
 A MC 
 A MC 
 Verse three: 
 You know that's right 
 That's why people got to get their high so they can get high 
 They blast and they passed the pipe to get high 
 Just like a jedi 
 Never said I would i 
 Even if I could i 
 Didn't do it but I just rather get a little shut eye 
 So I sleep from dawn to dusk in a bomb shelter 
 Cause ya never know 
 When the man is gonna drop that big one 
 Oh pelting, people burning melting 
 Alarm the farmers 
 Armageddon karma psychic readings 
 Greetings earthlings I'm from mars 
 Got two more planets to go and then I'm on my way to the stars 
 Oh no there I go through the ozone layer hole 
 Where the men are the men and they mean it 
 Down where the wind don't blow where the indo grow in the snow 
 And everybody po'
