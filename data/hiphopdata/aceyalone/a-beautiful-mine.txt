A Beautiful mind, turned water into wine 
 But that's not all 
 Broke the water, shined through 
 Shaped the earth, created the colder life 
 Radiated with energy, the great boat of life 
 The spark 
 Sparkling through the dark night 
 Then walked 
 And took forever without a thing in sight 
 Didn't hear a sound to the first ?treat? 
 ?Deaf to the ocean swelled?, washed up a miracle 
 A Beautiful yours, a beautiful mine 
 By the grace of fire, out sprouts the land 
 And did desire, footprints in the sand 
 On top of the mountain peak where the man speaks to himself 
 Cursing to them with a start 
 What he felt can't be described 
 It's alive 
 Rise with the tide 
 Communicate with all sides, nothing wants to die 
 Buildin' this, build a bridge 
 Build a tower 
 Construct a dam, nigga, ho 
 Build a flower 
 Ultraviolet rays magnified the essence 
 All praise to the presence, one pure thought 
 Taught him the lessons 
 This spread with the first migration of the heads 
 The first wants to flock 
 A beautiful yours, a beautiful mine 
 One's so enlightened; one's so divine 
 The planet's hour line, all devoid of time 
 A beautiful mind 
 They opened up the brain and opened up the heart 
 What is man made of? 
 Love from the dark 
 The will to invent the will 
 Work the field, the shield, the intent to kill, the uphill 
 Matter of existence, matter of persistence, 
 Matter of distance to search for the mystics 
 Finder of lost souls, teacher of apostles, the mind's so colossal 
 A beautiful mind 
 A beautiful mind, a beautiful idea 
 One that was right here, blind to the naked eye, tied to a fear 
 Once it was nothing and now it is here 
 A beautiful mind 
 Not accidental, coincidental, experimental 
 A beautiful man, though a touch so gentle 
 A life so simple to spin on the axis to access the temple 
 A beautiful mind 
 A beautiful mind, put fruit on the vine 
 At the same time he made love a crime 
 Mellowed out the strings of all mankind 
 Walked along side you when you was left behind 
 Purified the waters, carved the canyons 
 Fed the families when it was starved and famine 
 Drew the blueprints so everyone had a chance 
 Organized the people and made man advance 
 A beautiful yours, a beautiful mine 
 Something outa nothing 
 Oh, what a far cry 
 More than a hard tribe 
 Pointed out the start guide 
 Made love, made hate 
 Saved sake 
 Nothing left the crate but fate 
 Constructed structures, ?? a labyrinth 
 Detailed a portrait 
 Healed nations 
 Took blame when no one else was happening 
 Evolved the species, and had patience 
 Wrote the scroll in thousands of languages 
 Came with us to fight against a giant ?? 
 Created chaos, pervaded destruction 
 Made law and order and then corruption 
 Laid the foundation for all things to stand on 
 Then cleared the ground for the mother ship to land on 
 Sailed across the seas, followed the breeze 
 Cured disease 
 Made poison 
 Settled the fear, took them on the righteous path, 
 Gave them the math, and still had the time to laugh 
 What a beautiful mind to have
