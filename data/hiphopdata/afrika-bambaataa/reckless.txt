You make me reckless, reckless everyday 
 You make me reckless 
 Standin' by the disco floor 
 Spot this girl 
 My heart jump and move 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Walk over said to her 
 Lovely things 
 She said I was a fool 
 Oh no 
 She said 
 This is not the right time baby 
 I came here to groove 
 And recklessly 
 I took my time 
 When I look back 
 The girls had made a move 
 Yeah, yeah 
 The music played on, played on 
 Why didn't you make your move 
 Somebody came on, came on 
 And stole the girl from you 
 It's the groove 
 That makes you move 
 So come on and get down 
 To this funky sound 
 Do what you please 
 You are entitled to flaunt 
 Get wild and reckless 
 If you want 
 'Cause the sound we deliver 
 Will take you higher 
 Most definitely with 
 Desire, desire, de si si si sire 
 You make me reckless, reckless everyday 
 You make me reckless 
 You make me reckless, reckless everyday 
 You make me reckless 
 You make me reckless, reckless everyday 
 You make me reckless 
 You make me reckless, reckless everyday 
 You make me reckless 
 So as the music play 
 I had to find a way 
 To catch her eye 
 Yeah, yeah 
 The partner she was with 
 He did not know how to gig 
 Said i 
 Oh no 
 She said 
 Mister get away from me 
 I need a man 
 That knows how to move 
 Yeah, yeah 
 We start to dance 
 Suddenly a quick romance 
 Ooh yeah, yeah 
 The music played on, played on 
 Why didn't you make your move 
 Somebody came on, came on 
 And stole the girl from you 
 This is a message 
 That you should discover 
 You can't trust a girl 
 Or judge them by the cover 
 They can lead you on 
 And keep you in a daze 
 Keep you head over heels 
 And keep you amazed 
 Its up to you 
 Whether you fall in the trap 
 Just remember when you push up 
 To have a strong rap 
 'Cause now-a-days 
 Things are real funny 
 You can bet more than all she wants 
 Is your money 
 So listen to what I say 
 With or without 
 Yo, the girls is ok 
 Girls are the same everywhere 
 You can bet all they want from you 
 Is what they can get 
 And when they finish 
 You can bet that you've tried her 
 They'll leave you penniless 
 With desire 
 You make me reckless 
 You make me reckless, reckless everyday 
 You make me reckless
