We're in the building 
 Where they make us grow 
 And I'm frightened by 
 The liquid engineers 
 Like you. 
 My Mallory heart 
 Is sure to fail 
 I could crawl around the floor 
 Just like I'm real 
 Like you. 
 The sound of metal 
 I want to be 
 You 
 I could learn to be a man 
 Like you. 
 Plug me in 
 And turn me on 
 Oh everything is moving. 
 I need my treatment 
 It's tomorrow they send me 
 Singing 'I am an American'. 
 Do you? 
 Picture this 
 If I could make the change 
 I'd love to pull the wires from the wall 
 Did you? 
 And who are you 
 And how can I try 
 Here inside I like metal 
 Aren't you 
 All I know 
 Is no-one dies 
 I'm still confusing love with need.
