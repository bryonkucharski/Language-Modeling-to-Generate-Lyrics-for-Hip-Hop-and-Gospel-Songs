Ya Boy who to talk about, 
 And if there's hoes in the club we gon' walk 'em out, 
 MTV, I've never been there before, 
 But they all wanna go 'cause they already know where I'm (going), 
 Yeah straight to the top, 
 I already wear your advance in my watch, 
 BET, I've never been there before, 
 But they all wanna roll 'cause they already know where I'm (going)

 I don't really know but I know he got bucks, 
 Everything he own got it sittin' on dubs, 
 If he stay in the club gettin' high pourin' bub, 
 Ya boy live a rock star life, 
 Come home every night to a pop star wife, 
 We both have a ball baby, 
 Threesomes and all, 
 They all get low windows to the wall, 
 And I'm not Lil' John, 
 But I make em' get naked with their high heels on, 
 She could be a black broad like Christina Milian, 
 Or, a tall blonde like Paris Hilton, 
 She ask what I do, 
 I say get money, 
 And I'm gonna do that until the Reaper come for me, 
 Call me Ya Boy cause erbody love me, 
 Just in case you forgot bring the hook back for me, 
 I'm (going)

 Five hundred dollars for the tune, 
 Five hundred dollars for the shoes,

 As for that red I'll show ya what the hoochie do, 
 Got the whole world talkin', 
 Who this dude? 
 He remind me of Too Short cause his mouth is rude, 
 And he so West Coast like Snoop and Cube, 
 But his flow like Jay-Z on the DJ Clue, 
 He's (going) goin' gone, 
 They said I wouldn't make it so I gotta prove 'em wrong, 
 These rappers ain't right so I gotta do 'em wrong, 
 These hoes ain't shit so I gotta do 'em all, 
 And you know I'm gonna ball like I'm eight feet tall, 
 Cause my flow like sushi it so so raw, 
 It means my career will be so so long, 
 They know where I'm going so I had to do the song, 
 Baby girl I'm (going)
