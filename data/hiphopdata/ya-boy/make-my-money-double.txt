The ladies love the way I touch dough, so 
 I'm on the block trying bump more 
 I can't help the way I stunt though 
 I'm trying to make my money double 
 I'm in the street with the white 
 I got the work and the price 
 State to state, taking flights 
 All day and all night 
 Yo, bricks of the white 
 Pounds of the purp 
 And for the right price, come around to the turf 
 We don't keep tucked outside with the work 
 I strap it on a bitch make her fly with the work 
 Ya boy want 17-5 for the work 
 23 in the south take a ride with the work 
 Fuck what you heard, I'm a grind till it hurt 
 Knock on wood, I get caught won't say a word 
 We call it a brick, they call it a bird 
 We call it a corner, they call it a curb 
 I got a hotline, you can call for the herb 
 Mathematics with a addicts, you can call me a nerd 
 I don't get money nigga, that is absurd 
 I passed it like magic, then ball like Byrd 
 You can find me in the hood from the first to the third 
 Goin' hard for them clear diamond stones and infirms 
 You know 
 The ladies love the way I touch dough, so 
 I'm on the block trying bump more 
 I can't help the way I stunt though 
 I'm trying to make my money double 
 I'm in the street with the white 
 I got the work and the price 
 State to state, taking flights 
 All day and all night 
 That's only 10 bricks 
 Coulda swore I saw more 
 I chop 'em all up, you can call soft *** 
 I got white galore 
 So, my money comin' more 
 Bank America know, my accounts are offshore 
 Why have a girlfriend when I can have yours 
 The boy so fly, got butterfly doors 
 Lord knows the hores love Bentley exhaust 
 So I got mine, all black, fresh from the store 
 Fresh out the door, pimping like Fylmore 
 Slim tell her sprint till her feet get sore 
 And if it's raining bitch you walk between the rain drops 
 Then get a nigga dough till you see the rain stop 
 Keep quiet nigga, you ain't gotta name drop 
 The tech, different snitches, they all the same cops 
 We call a half, different mother, same pops 
 Different cover but it still the same cars 
 You know 
 The ladies love the way I touch dough, so 
 I'm on the block trying bump more 
 I can't help the way I stunt though 
 I'm trying to make my money double 
 I'm in the street with the white 
 I got the work and the price 
 State to state, taking flights 
 All day and all night 
 And cracks in the walls got packs in the drawers 
 My bitch enter the door, the gat and the bra 
 Half these niggas that got a gat in their drawers 
 Behind closed doors with the captain and sarge 
 I'm might be on the block with the sack in my balls 
 UPS if the package is large 
 Send it to Mississippi, surpassing the law 
 Then the money appears the next day like voila 
 I'm tryin' to double up 
 Nigga I tell you what 
 My creme makes the fiends jump like double dutch 
 The black lambo float like a rubber duck 
 Precise game, every bitch want some of us 
 But I'm all about the cash, all about the paper 
 The money see me now so the hoes see me later 
 If flippin's a crime, I down for the caper 
 That's why I got the ride's inside alligator 
 You know 
 The ladies love the way I touch dough, so 
 I'm on the block trying bump more 
 I can't help the way I stunt though 
 I'm trying to make my money double 
 I'm in the street with the white 
 I got the work and the price 
 State to state, taking flights 
 All day and all night
