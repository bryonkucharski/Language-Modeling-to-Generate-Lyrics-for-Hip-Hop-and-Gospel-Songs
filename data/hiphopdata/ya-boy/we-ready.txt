Leaders aren't born, they're made 
 And there made just like anything else through hard work 
 That's the price we gotta pay to achieve our goal 
 Let's get it 
 Last of a dying breed, heart of a lion 
 All of my soldiers with me, we all right 
 Ain't no stopping once the red light turn green 
 I will not lose, I know they heard me 
 I go hard still fly were the birds be 
 If he tryna stop me then he gon' need surgery 
 They can't serve me, waiter or hater 
 On my way to glory baby I see you later 
 Ain't nobody promise this 
 Please check my accomplishments 
 Better find your niche 'cause you ridin' in the wrong lane 
 Call me anything besides a king, you callin' me by the wrong name 
 I'm like LeBron James here and it won't change 
 See, this is my life, this is not a game 
 I jam the court if they let me 
 Ask me if we ready for war, I'ma tell you 
 We ready, fresh off the block 
 We ready, coming for the top spot 
 We ready, that's right, we came to win 
 I'm going in, I'm going in 
 We ready, fresh off the block 
 We ready, coming for the top spot 
 We ready, that's right, we came to win 
 I'm going in, I'm going in 
 I got it done when they said I couldn't do it 
 I never stopped for bullshit, I kept it moving 
 This is why I grind like Ali in his prime 
 I put in the work so this is why I shine 
 Don't tell me I'm great, I hear that all the time 
 You just tell a friend and spread the word while I climb 
 And if I don't get the crown for some reason 
 I be back to put it down for next season 
 It's on my soul, I put my heart in it 
 You say you want it real when I'm so authentic 
 Y'all won't finish 'cause y'all so timid 
 Every pass, every play, every yard I been in 
 We ready, fresh off the block 
 We ready, coming for the top spot 
 We ready, that's right, we came to win 
 I'm going in, I'm going in 
 We ready, fresh off the block 
 We ready, coming for the top spot 
 We ready, that's right, we came to win 
 I'm going in, I'm going in 
 Everybody's got a dream, repeat after me 
 Not right now but on three 
 One, two, three, say we ready 
 One, two, three, say we ready 
 Go for the crown, don't never back down 
 Every city you hit make it jump down 
 We run that city, run that city 
 Say I run this city, I run this city 
 Follow the leader, I show you how it's done 
 I never let us down, we remain number one 
 All the greats before me gave me the stamp 
 Remember that name, Ya Boy, your true champ 
 We ready, fresh off the block 
 We ready, coming for the top spot 
 We ready, that's right, we came to win 
 I'm going in, I'm going in 
 We ready, fresh off the block 
 We ready, coming for the top spot 
 We ready, that's right, we came to win 
 I'm going in, I'm going in 
 YB, I'm goin' in, it's the lack of fate 
 That makes people afraid of taking chances 
 I believe in myself, how 'bout you? 
 It's not a game, it's more than a game, we ready
