 'Cause when I pull up I don't need identification 
 Make way for the rockstar 
 Red carpet next to a pop-star 
 I'm Obama's momma

 Fuck what they say I run the bay 
 Brought this bitch all the way to L.A.

 Some dubz and I'm strapped like a seat-belt bitch 
 Hatin' on me that's female shit 
 Wrags out my niggas detail shit

 Economically depressed 
 Play a boss ?a fossil? make you open up your chest

 Drugs, money, murder, sex 
 Blocks boomin we ?slam coonin? the best 
 We love to spoil ourself we such a mess 
 Gotta hit and put it on her arms and necks 
 Put this in the bra like a text message 
 Money call, Jupiter ballin 
 Speakers knockin', truck throbbin 
 Generals ?cobbles? on Tennessee's seargants 
 Diamonds glare, females stare 
 40 you dat dude, ain't no compare 
 Diamonds glare, females stare

 Yes sir, it's the best of 
 The new west so you best of ?westa? 
 The block ?BB eyes? he plottin on a robbery 
 'Cause I'm about to steal the red beam you got me 
 Bring the beat back I'm about to heat that 
 This is just foreplay baby so let me tease that 
 See I be the hardest regardless 
 Beats, food, and I'm about to harvest 
 I goes harder than y'all 
 Stackin up paper higher than Captain Bacard 
 What you expect from a dego boss 
 They go dego hard, or put they go on 
 So next time you mention Hood's name at all 
 Make sure I'm big dipper hood superstar

 Diamonds shinin look at my rise 
 Diamond in the back chandelier inside 
 Too much floss, gotta play the cards 
 To make it as the boss 
 So as I walk in front and spy 
 Everything stops, the parking lot pops 
 Mouthes just drop, I am but you're not 
 They comin' in flocks 
 If some not got yeah I know you spyin 
 Hatin' on the shine, I must still got it 
 I take me trips out to Covo 
 ?Feel it? on the beach, vanilla colored Diablo 
 'Cause I'm a superstar, a super-duper-star 
 When my car pull up to the front of the party 
 They be like there go Young Gotti 
 I see they runnin' up but they don't really want it with me [they don't really want it with me (2x)] 
 I run the baddest hit my status they know we be [they know we be, they know we be (2x)]

 They cameras goin' off 
 Your bucket rollin' off 
 My Bentley rollin' in 
 They say I'm showin off 
 Man I'm just showin up 
 Them dueces twirlin round 
 ?Nigga? dipped in butter 
 It keeps your girl around 
 You see this Gucci belt 
 ?C-Cuggi? hug my waist 
 Might fit it on ?promel? 
 ?Come rileys? hug my face 
 Each day as I appear 
 Them girl won't leave me alone 
 This week is Halle Berry 
 Next week is me alone
