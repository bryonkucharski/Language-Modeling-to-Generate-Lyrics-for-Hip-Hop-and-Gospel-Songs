If you hear this on the radio 
 Then we've already said our last goodbye 
 I won't be there when you get home 
 By now there's someone else that hears you cry 
 I wonder if he holds you like I did 
 I hope that he can love you better 
 'Cause we were everything that's right at the wrong time 
 I didn't want to lose you 
 Leave you with a broken heart 
 But wherever we are, we're miles apart 
 I know that we tried, but this is the last goodbye 
 Oh, I didn't want to let you go 
 But wherever we are, we're miles apart 
 I know that we tried, but this is the last goodbye 
 We were almost beautiful 
 A broken piece of art put on display 
 But we were never possible 
 Another perfect moment thrown away 
 I know somebody out there will love you 
 They'll be the forever we never were 
 'Cause we were everything that's right at the wrong time
