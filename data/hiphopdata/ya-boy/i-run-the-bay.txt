I get money, money I got (yup) 
 Stunts call me honey if they feel real hot 
 (Yeah they do) 
 I get money, money I got (that's right) 
 Stunts call me honey if they feel real hot 
 Ya Boy: 
 I get money, I-I get money I-I get money (tell em) 
 I get I get (What I get nigga?) I get I get money 
 Money I got 
 I-I get money, money I got 
 I-I get money (yeah, they gotta feel me) 
 Money, money, money I got 
 (Haters do what the fuck you do nigga) 
 I run the bay! 
 Ay, I'm Montana in his prime 
 Hammer on my side 
 Term said I need a bandana when I ride 
 K in the bushes, cannon in the ride 
 Gotta stay strapped, simple that's the way that I survive 
 Rush a nigga fast, like Sapp off the line 
 Then know off his mask when I clap off the nine 
 Niggaz in the hood gimme that off my grind 
 And hoes in Hollywood gimme head off my shine 
 I turn them hoes around, lemme hit it from behind 
 Then I put that long, black, Bay shit in they spine 
 Rappers always say that fake shit in they rhymes 
 They ain't sold no dope, they ain't clutched no nines 
 I'm like a parkin meter how I touch those dimes 
 And quarters, I have ya orders 
 On time 
 Got the best flow in the west to this day 
 Its gon' stay that way 
 Ask around, I run the Bay 
 I run the Bay 
 I run the Bay 
 Wh-What's good LA 
 I run the Bay 
 Ya bitch know I run the bay 
 Ya momma know I run the bay 
 Wh-What's good LA 
 Shout out to Troy Carter, let's get this dough 
 There ain't another nigga that can spit this flow 
 There ain't a younger nigga with chips this long 
 So I play with cars like I'm six years old 
 I need my bread and my biscuits hoe 
 I fry these niggaz, I got a fishstick flow 
 Ya Boy is dope, ya betta sniff this blow 
 And if ya broke you betta fix it hoe 
 Call me the bus, you missed it hoe 
 You can kiss my ass with yo lipstick on 
 Look good, Ya Boy throw that slick shit on 
 Did it for the nookie, like Limp Bizkits song 
 Made her sip this Trone, lick this bone 
 And after I hit it I'm gone 
 No lie, hop in the Astin 
 Wave while I'm passin 
 Puffin on that big bubba kush while I'm chantin 
 (I get money) 
 I run the Bay 
 Ya bitch know I run the Bay 
 Wh-What's good LA 
 I said ya bitch know I run the bay 
 Ya momma know I run the bay 
 I run the bay 
 What's good La
