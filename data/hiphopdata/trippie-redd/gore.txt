I said even if it kills me 
 I'ma always keep it real, b 
 Yeah, ya dig 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah I, yeah I, yeah I 
 I said even if it kills me, even if it kills me, I'ma win 
 Yeah, I said even if it kills me, even if it kills me, I'ma win (huh)

 Hold 'up, ay 
 Put that on my momma, fuck that drama 
 I'ma keep getting these commas 
 On my momma, got a nigga ballin' like I'm Iguodala 
 For the dollar, I go brazy on this set 
 Keep a ratchet it go 'blat!' 
 If you talk down you get blessed 
 With this yoppa at your neck, I don't want no smoke 
 I don't play no games, I don't tell no jokes 
 If a nigga try me best believe that nigga gettin' poked 
 Got this water on my neck, you try to take it you get soaked (uh) 
 That's that heat wave, let the heat blaze 
 Left hand came back, like LeBron Heat days 
 Keep the peace, ay, gotta keep the peace way 
 'Cause it get real, nigga, for Pete's sake

 Even if it kills me 
 Even if it kills me 
 Yeah, put that on my mom 
 Put that on my mom 
 Put that on my mom, put that on my mom 
 Put that on my mom, even if it kills me, even if it kills me, ay 
 Even if it kills me, ay 
 Even if it, ay 
 Even if it, ay 
 I said, even if it kills me, even if it kills me, even if it kills me
