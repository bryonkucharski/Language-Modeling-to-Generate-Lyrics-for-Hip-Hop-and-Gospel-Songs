Baby what you wishin' for? 
 Maybe you should wish it more? 
 Maybe the world is yours? 
 Maybe when it rains it pours? 
 Keep on wishin' (I don't know how to wish anymore) 
 Keep on wishin' (I don't know how to wish anymore) 
 I got it all (Or do I) 
 Wish you'd get out my face, might go MIA 
 Might just blow my brain, R.I.P Kurt Cobain 
 I can't feel my face 
 I can't feel my face 
 I can't feel my face 
 I can't feel my face 
 I wish you will find your chill 
 'Cause Lord knows this shit get real 
 And for this price you know you'll kill 
 And it's big brack, you know the deal 
 And it's big slat, you know the deal 
 Draco on big dragon fire hell 
 Can't save me man save yourself 
 'Cause I do not need no help 
 Keep on wishin' 
 Keep on wishin' 
 Keep on wishin'
