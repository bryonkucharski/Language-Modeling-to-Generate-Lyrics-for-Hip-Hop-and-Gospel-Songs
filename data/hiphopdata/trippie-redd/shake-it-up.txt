Columbine, roll a five 
 Baby shake that ass, shake that pumpkin pie 
 Twin sisters side by side, shake it side by side 
 Twin sisters side by side, shake it side by side

 Twin sisters side by side, shake it side by side 
 Twin sisters side by side, shake it side by side

 Go and shake that ass hoe for big 14 
 If you want some cash hoe, big ass cheese 
 Go and shake your ass hoe, like the twerk team

 Yeah, to the wall to the window 
 Put that ass in reverse just like Uno

 Where abouts is your bitch, I'm like who knows 
 Drop that ass baby, not too low, ey 
 Shake that ass bitch just like ooh-woah

 Twin sisters side by side, shake it side by side

 Twin sisters side by side, shake it side by side
