Somehow, my songs always apply to my real life right now 
 I be predicting the future 
 I think I'm good at that shit 
 Yeah, uh 
 This is a beat pusher production 
 Everyday I keep it real and get that bag, hoe 
 'Cause that shit up for grabs hoe, put that on my tab hoe 
 Jimmy Neutron, I told that bitch to have a blast, hoe 
 Yes I'm a asshole, bitch why you mad for? 
 They say that I'm mad dope 
 Ballin' on a budget with my cousins moving mad dope 
 To eat and see that cash flow 
 Niggas always hating but ain't got no fucking bag bro 
 I just keep it pushing I ain't worried 'bout the mad folks 
 If a nigga test me I'ma reach up in this bag though 
 And put on my ski mask, hoe 
 And let off hella shots and do 200 on the dash, bro 
 I can't go out sad, bro 
 Got a family and I still wanna pop some tags more 
 Used to want a Jag, hoe 
 Now I'm in a Bentley still want the money 
 SS 14s on the side it's Trippie 
 I don't think they get me 
 Build a legacy and hope my niggas be up with me 
 If not then you is against me 
 Leave your body souless, empty 
 Used to feel so empty 
 Now the chips is stacking up, I need like every fucking penny 
 And everyone that's with me 
 I used to feel alone, but I know my brother's soul is with me 
 I know Oompa's soul is with me 
 Everyday I keep it real and get that bag, hoe 
 'Cause that shit up for grabs, hoe 
 Put that on my tab, hoe 
 Jimmy Neutron, I told that bitch to have a blast, hoe 
 Yes, I'm a asshole 
 Bitch, why you mad for? 
 They say that I'm mad dope 
 Ballin' on a budget with my cousins moving mad dope 
 To eat and see that cash flow 
 Niggas always hating but ain't got no fucking bag bro 
 I just keep it pushing I ain't worried 'bout the mad folks
