(Skee-Lo) 
 The other day I was cruisin' the shaw I seen Jay 
 The big homey from Oakland runs the bay 
 I used to be in love wit his sister back in the day 
 Had to holler at him see what he had to say 
 It's good to see him now and know that he's ok 
 He asked how I was doin' and then proceeded to say 
 What happened to the record, what's up wit the air-play 
 Politics too many haters is in the way 
 It's ok now but really it's no excuse 
 I can tell you how it all went down but what's the use 
 It's a lot of people walkin' around wit there tongues loose 
 And I don't care what nobody tell you I got juice 
 Takin' it day by day, do or die 
 Hustlin', imagine this game wit I 
 Did you think I would just lay back and not try 
 I'ma bounce back, get on my feet, get on my hustle man 
 (Chorus x2: Skee-Lo) 
 If you can go anywhere in this world where would it be 
 It depends on how much in this life you wanna see 
 And to get there can't be cheap it ain't free 
 Gotta bounce back, get on your feet, get on your hustle man 
 (Skee-Lo) 
 Do the math focus and stay on the right path 
 Forget about the busters and snitches that all laugh 
 You know people when they see money they wanna grab 
 Greed, how much money you wanna have 
 Stay away from criminal act and crack labs 
 Quick money ain't no money it turns bad 
 Trust god make him the only friend you have 
 Instead of short brothers wit tempers that get mad 
 Whenever there's somebody that's tryin' to limit you tho' 
 Downin' you tellin' you places you can't go 
 You got to have faith in yourself you gotta show 
 Their opinions really ain't worth nothing they don't know 
 It's a whole lotta player involved you ain't seen 
 That ain't been half the places that you been 
 I'm tellin' you all you brothers that want cream 
 Bounce back, get on your feet, get on your hustle man 
 (Chorus x2: Skee-Lo) 
 If you can go anywhere in this world where would it be 
 It depends on how much in this life you wanna see 
 And to get there can't be cheap it ain't free 
 Gotta bounce back, get on your feet, get on your hustle man 
 (Skee-Lo) 
 Will you go to the top, will you settle for crumbs 
 I hope you ain't none of these brothers that act dumb 
 Never learned to chill and relax and have fun 
 Steady livin' life in the shade wit no sun 
 You got to learn to deal wit your problems you can't run 
 How you gonna ever advance to number one 
 And settle for number two that's something I can't feel 
 Got bein' broke mixed up wit bein' real 
 Keep it real brothers, stay on your feet, get on your hustle 
 If you can do it without force use muscle 
 Walk soft carry a stick ready to tussle 
 Your friends really ain't your friends and don't trust you 
 Wait for the day that you fall and hope and pray 
 You probably owe some of them money and can't pay 
 And you wanna know what I do think what do I say 
 Bounce back, get on your feet, get on your hustle man 
 (Chorus x2: Skee-Lo) 
 If you can go anywhere in this world where would it be 
 It depends on how much in this life you wanna see 
 And to get there can't be cheap it ain't free 
 Gotta bounce back, get on your feet, get on your hustle man
