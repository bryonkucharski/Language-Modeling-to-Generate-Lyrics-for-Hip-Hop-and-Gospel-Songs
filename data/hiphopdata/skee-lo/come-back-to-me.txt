"If you don't mind (if you don't mind), 
 We'd like to play somethin' (play somethin')" 
 (Skee-Lo) 
 Gloria, pick up I know your there stop frontin just pick up 
 Aight look, look I know I messed up 
 But check it out just listen 
 (Skee-Lo) 
 I'm leavin' you this message spotly 'cause I miss you 
 I didn't mean to diss you but sometimes I slip, ya got me 
 Stumblin over boulders lookin' over my shoulders 
 Hopin you're behind me but the sun blinds my vision 
 No competiton 'cause I'm wishin and hopin 
 That we could go to Canada, and Ann Lee lopin but nopin 
 I know you caught playin' with your heart 
 Shoulda known that I was up to no good from the start 
 Little hoodrat who's that guy I saw you walkin' with 
 Talkin' with actin' like he's wit ya 
 Just like 2 Pac you know "I get around" 
 But I didn't mean to get around with your little sister 
 Think I was lookin' for your friend so let me try again 
 To prove myself 'cause I don't want nobody else 
 It's been 7 hours and 16 days since you took your love away 
 So I just want to say that you should 
 (Chorus: Skee-Lo) 
 Come back to me 
 Come back to me 
 Baby, baby please come back to me 
 Come back to me 
 Come back to me 
 Baby, baby please come back to me 
 (Skee-Lo) 
 Oh stacker, cracker I'm the one who's badder 
 1 step 2 step 3 step 4 
 Oh are you sure that you really want to leave me 
 I tell you that I love you but I don't think you believe me 
 I never meant you any wrong my dear 
 Besides yo you can't believe everything you hear 
 So just like Stevie "I Wonder" is there water all under the bridge 
 It's thrillin but lately I've had this strangest feelin' like Jodeci 
 I'm goin' through the emotions so baby won't you just stay OK! 
 I'm tryin' to get you offa my mind but you just won't go away 
 In fact just the other day I was coolin at a party on a Friday 
 Doin' things my way chillin' with my cousin Shareef 
 A girl walks my way couldn't say get away 
 'Cause then again it goes against my Islamic believes 
 So I'm a big game to get to know the honeys name 
 Cause you know that I was lookin' for a real good time 
 She was fine so I kicked a few lines 
 But I couldn't get ya out my mind, get ya out of my mind, so 
 (Chorus: Skee-Lo) 
 Come back to me 
 Come back to me 
 Baby, baby please come back to me 
 Come back to me 
 Come back to me 
 Baby, baby please come back to me 
 Come back to me 
 Come back to me 
 Baby, baby please come back to me 
 Come back to me 
 Come back to me 
 Baby, baby please come baaaaaaaaaccckk! 
 (Skee-Lo) 
 All the real good ships of lollypops 
 Stop for a second and listen to ya heart 
 And if ya still say no then I'm gonna have to let you go with it 
 And wave goodbye and give one last cry 
 'Cause I'm not goin' to take it no more so don't do that 
 Can't keep breakin my heart so don't pursue that 
 Time has been wasted time has been spent 
 Pain is the essence but not my intent 
 So gaze through the woods and stop through the meadows 
 'Cause I love Lucy like Bill love Jello 
 And if you ever change your mind one day 
 Then you know where I stay just a block away 
 And I wait for you to 
 (Chorus: Skee-Lo) 
 Come back to me 
 Come back to me 
 Baby, baby please come back to me 
 Come back to me 
 Come back to me 
 Baby, baby please come back to me 
 Come back to me 
 Come back to me 
 Baby, baby please come back to me 
 Come back to me 
 Come back to me 
 Baby, baby please come baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacccccckk!
