 (Joe Love) 
 Last year when I went home, got in my car and got gone 
 Hit the streets and shot on, 18 years since I'm gone 
 Call my homie Jerome, spoke to his brother Tyrome 
 Who seemed a little distant cause my calls were not persistent 
 He say Rome went to prison for resistin' arrest 
 And mamma had a problem wit her chest, what, cardiac arrest 
 I was hurt and ain't even been here a week 
 And after all that bad news I couldn't speak 
 And my toes went weak and my legs went numb 
 It gets crazy in the streets tryin' to live wit no funds 
 Don't cheat you don't eat, your case you can't beat 
 Public defenders is there to make the deals go sweet 
 For the prosecution it's like an execution 
 But you can mae it if you're patient and avoid confusion 
 It took a while for me to learn this and stay on my feet 
 But if this rappin' don't happen for me I'm goin' back to the streets 
 Street life, street life, street life, street life 
 Street life, street life, street life, street life 
 (Skee-Lo) 
 Before the day that I blew up back when I grew up 
 Back when I had a shag chewin' gum wearin' chucks 
 Before I even thought about makin' the big bucks 
 I was busy throwin' rocks at cars and dump trucks 
 Even now I can hear her mamma callin' my full name 
 Me and uncle Joe would be watchin' the Bulls game 
 Before they had Jordan when all you needed was change 
 To get yourself some candy, some pickles and sugar canes 
 Even then I could feel the streets movin' all through 
 My veins and everything I seen absorbed in my brain 
 I'm not afraid to tell it my brother I'm not ashamed 
 You take a look at me now and look at where I came 
 Robert Taylor, 4500 on State Street in Chicago 
 Where most of the hoodsters and thugs be 
 If it hadn't of been for all the people that loved me 
 And for god's grace life get cruel and ugle in the streets 
 Street life, street life, street life, street life 
 Street life, street life, street life, street life 
 (Skee-Lo) 
 It's all good 
 But people don't, got it misunderstood, street code is 
 Simply you stick to your own hood 
 Stay in your own woods and chop your own tree 
 And if something jumps off pretend you didn't see 
 Keep your mouth shut up, for you get knocked up 
 Ain't no since in tryin' to get somebody else locked up 
 And that's the truth 
 That's why I send messages to the youth 
 Hope the lord makes a way out 
 Forget the gang and stay out 
 Cause everybody wants to live in the sunshine 
 If not right now at least at one time 
 Look back in your mind remember you was a kid 
 Remember before you grew up how innocent you lived 
 From big wheels to big thrills and big heights 
 From innocent to killin' your brother for Air Nikes 
 And I can't believe that none of these things don't 
 Strike y'all brothers in the head like this ain't right 
 Street life, street life, street life, street life 
 Street life, street life, street life, street life
