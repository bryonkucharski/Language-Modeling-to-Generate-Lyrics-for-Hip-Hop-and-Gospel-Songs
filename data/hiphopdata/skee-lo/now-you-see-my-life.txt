There once was a kid named Deuce 
 Who got sick and tired of being picked on 
 So he got himself a nice 22 
 Click boom, now he's on the fuckin' news 
 Now who's the king of these rap acts? American Bad ass 
 They say he's a class act, no wonder he's jabbed at 
 That's why they put me up in lights and I rap back 
 And have these critics wanna mimic my crack ass 
 He ain't no cinic but he knows where your dad's at 
 They ain't gonna finish till they send you to Bagdhad 
 And minute by minute they goin' pull you right in it 
 You go' end up at clinics because they put you on xanax 
 But don't you worry I'm back ya Deuce is back with a black hat 
 Cape and a black cat baby I'm the new Batman 
 You know only sarah can grab that 
 I don't need no groupies trying to grab at my pants 
 Hoping that I'm gonna go back and tax that 
 I ain't endin' up in no place with no bad rash 
 How come I get laughed at by media trash bags 
 Just because I'm white and I sing like I'm half black 
 Now you see my life and it looks so pretty looks so pretty 
 You want what you can't have and you know that's too damn bad 
 Try and take my pride we both know that's silly know that's silly 
 You want what you can't have and you know that's too damn bad 
 Soon as my voice's touch's or even get's close to a track 
 It's rat-a-tat-tat-tat I'm droppin' bomb's on they asses 
 Burn you up in the ashes ya I'm back to my old tactics 
 Rappin' to slay faggots and rappers who ain't have what it take's 
 So I straight jack 'em, Slap em' I ain't laughin' 
 This is where it gets tragic homie you ain't matchin' me or my ryhmes 
 Half black half white rapper tryna' downgrade my skills 
 Tellin' everyone I'm wack, shit what about your habbit? 
 Slangin' dope on the streets from your one bedroom apartment 
 "Hey look, it's me Cartman I'm retarted" 
 Don't get me started how these old farts tryn' pick apart my religion 
 Of course I'm gifted ain't no god but I'm lifted 
 Listen I'm the wizkid who grew up a little different 
 Welcome to my life bitch, It's my last mission 
 Now you see my life and it looks so pretty looks so pretty 
 You want what you can't have and you know that's too damn bad 
 Try and take my pride we both know that's silly know that's silly 
 You want what you can't have and you know that's too damn bad 
 I was born to rip shit, Born with too much wit 
 That's why they call me the wizkid 'cause I drop hits 
 Mimic me? I'm too sick, you can't hang I'm too quick 
 What's my name? DEUCE BITCh, it's the new shit 
 Leavin' ego's bruised in ya you're trapped you're stupid 
 Try and step in my shoes but it's foolish 
 I'm coo coo homie I got screw's loose 
 Fuck Tool you can kiss my ass too bitch. You and your affiliates 
 You're worth two cents of my time and a few bars so move bitch 
 As long as I'm doing music, I'ma be a nuesence, It's a new movement 
 Now you see my life and it looks so pretty looks so pretty 
 You want what you can't have and you know that's too damn bad 
 Try and take my pride we both know that's silly know that's silly 
 You want what you can't have and you know that's too damn bad 
 Now you see my life and it looks so pretty looks so pretty 
 You want what you can't have and you know that's too damn bad 
 Try and take my pride we both know that's silly know that's silly 
 You want what you can't have and you know that's too damn bad
