(Feat. Drewskee and Kozii) 
 (Skee-Lo) 
 We fall and we bounce back I bet you an ounce that 
 My lyrics make sense and the base line's phat 
 This life that I'm livin' is so sweet that 
 I'm constantly chased by millions of hoodrats 
 In the same room I see them all at one time 
 Yellin' Drew better get you a freak I got mine 
 And I know she probably be wit me in no time 
 'Cause it's gold on my watch and money on my mind 
 Plus I'm rollin' a Lex that's on 20's 
 Serious about my sound so my amps be 
 Fillin' up most of the space that be empty 
 Don't want to take yo chick so don't tempt me 
 Can't get it out my head 
 This thought I had when I got out of bed 
 As I looked at the mirror at myself and said 
 Got to call Big Chris, Drewskee and Tez 
 See what's crackin' tonight 
 (Chorus x2: Kozii) 
 Do it tonight 
 All night 
 Let's get it started right 
 (Drewskee) 
 Sittin' in the casino surrounded by women 
 Up twenty thousand tryin' to cash in my winnings 
 Hennessey on the rocks got my head spinnin' 
 Baby see me count my money then she started grinnin' 
 Can I go wit you she said me and my friend 
 And I'm lookin' for Skee-Lo so we can tag team him 
 Call him on the celly phone, what's goin' on 
 Tonight's the night like Betty Wright 
 Let's get it on 
 I got two ladies say they really like your music 
 They say they not groupies but still they want to do me 
 You tell them that we ain't spendin' a dime 
 I ain't got to tell them nothing they still stuck in '99 
 Plus I'm not wastin' your time 
 What these freaks look like 
 Well, mines is tight but yours is fine 
 I'ma tell you one more time 
 You need to hit me back on the line 
 Let me know what's up for tonight 
 (Chorus: Kozii) 
 Do it tonight 
 All night 
 Let's get it started right 
 (Skee-Lo) 
 Say Drew these brothers ain't done nothing new 
 And for everything they did we done done that too 
 Let them go ahead and stare skeeter don't care 
 I crush the player hater out of anybody in there 
 Even padlocks ain't safe from mattlock 
 You shouldn't have got me started I told you I can't stop 
 Makin' your heart drop, makin' you kids watch 
 I'll make you wanna party wit everyone on your block 
 Thinkin' you top notch you trippin' like hop schotch 
 My lyrics is blue prints two chicks on Bay Watch 
 For exposure, we get wet and smoke doja 
 Everybody know about Skee I gots flow I 
 Don't mess wit none of these women that's mintelosha 
 Everybody tryin' to get a sip of my Momosa 
 (Chorus: Kozii) 
 Do it tonight 
 All night 
 Let's get it started right
