 (Verse 1: Dizzee Rascal) 
 Look at that back off, stacked tough 
 Maybe when the jack off 
 I gotta take my hat off 
 Standing ovation, round of applause 
 Clap off, all up in my face 
 I could never lose track of 
 I don't wanna sound rude 
 But you got a lot of cheek 
 And your body looks peak sweet pea 
 Good enough to eat 
 I'm guessin you're a lover in the sheets 
 I really wanna be 
 And I ain't never seen a bottom like that before 
 I ain't never seen a bum so fat before 
 You got back galore 
 I'll be a happy chappy if you let me smack it for you 
 Tap it for you, slap it for you 
 I don't wanna waste your time 
 But I wanna chase what's under your waistline, I'm fine 
 I'm just having a bone but I'm zonin 
 Wishing I could own it 
 I just wanna promote it and bone it 
 (Hook: Sean Kingston) 
 You got 'em falling like when you break it down 
 You're like a heart attack yeah 
 No wonder no man around you can act sane 
 When you're moving like that 
 But they don't understand that they don't got a chance 
 'Cause I got other plans for us tonight 
 You got 'em falling like when you break it down 
 'Cause they never seen an arse like that 
 Ouch! 
 Arse like that 
 Ouch! 
 Arse like that 
 (Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal) 
 Your buff is done, your arse is retarded 
 A lot of junk in your trunk but far from garbage 
 You're a keeper, come and ride in my 2 seater 
 Late night creeper, I'm pleased to meet ya 
 Hate to see you go, love to see you leave 
 Figure I can't perceive 
 Wondering how you achieved such a beautiful body, I can't believe 
 So sorry I'm lost for words, I could hardly breathe 
 God give me strength, your [?] a blessing 
 Jiggling it all over the shop, you ain't messing 
 I wanna get closer, suppose I'd better step in 
 You got the kind of body I won't be forgetting 
 Pleasing my senses, I ain't being pretentious 
 There's a lot of incentive why you're being defensive 
 I'm a bedroom bully, let me beat it up 
 Stop playin', girl let me heat it up, what's up? 
 Wind that bum bum, move that bum bum 
 Shake that bum bum, grind that bum bum 
 Let me smack it up, back it up 
 Let me smack it up, back it up 
 You got 'em falling like when you break it down 
 You're like a heart attack yeah 
 No wonder no man around you can act sane 
 When you're moving like that 
 But they don't understand that they don't got a chance 
 'Cause I got other plans for us tonight 
 You got 'em falling like when you break it down 
 'Cause they never seen an arse like that 
 Ouch! 
 Arse like that 
 Ouch! 
 Arse like that
