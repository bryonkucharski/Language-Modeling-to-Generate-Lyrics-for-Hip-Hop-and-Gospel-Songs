 Yo, I'm Dizzee Ras, nightmare from the big e-a-s-t 
 I'm exactly what your parents don't wanna see on your TV 
 I'm nasty, precisely, intimidate anyone that I choose 
 Refuse to lose, express unlimited controversial views 
 Your average boy or girl on the street might be familiar with my beat 
 And/or familiar with my sound, 
 I'm formerly from the underground 
 And its clear, for a year 
 I've been turnin' up the heat 
 Made you get up an' outta your seat 
 Shake your fists and shuffle your feet 
 Let's make another thing clear 
 They didn't burn me up enough, I'm still here 
 So what was the purpose of your little charade? 
 Your little charade was whack 
 Just about hurt meh, 
 You shoulda marked me up on a rampage now I'm back 
 5 stab wounds, couple scratchin', bruisin' and some (chains?) 
 4 half-hearted fassies, 4 borers, no brains 
 Did it, two weeks before my album helped me sell double 
 But let's not dwell on that, it's the least of your trouble

 Hey y'all considerin', the part I play, the position I'm in 
 You wouldn't be expectin' me to say 
 I prefer the day to nights when I gotta turn up and play-up 
 Rip-off dusty sweaty cluttered raves 
 Where the audience all screw-face and the promoters don't wanna pay 
 And half o'the boys in the crowd wanna blast me 
 And half o'the girls wanna show how little they care 'bout standin right there 
 At the front tryin' a look right past me 
 It gets depressin', thinkin' 'bout it even more 
 Knowin' that I'm gonna face the usual hassle at the door 
 Because as well as lippy hacks I hate cocky bouncers 
 I ain't ere to rave I'm ere to get paid, look 
 You search me up rough like I'm any common crook 
 Y name's on the flyer man, forget the guest book 
 Abusin' your authority, you look like a fool 
 You faulty standard underdog, you know you're old skool 
 I ain't wearin' a shirt and shoes, so you don't think I look right 
 But its cushty mate, I'm gettin' paid more than you tonight
