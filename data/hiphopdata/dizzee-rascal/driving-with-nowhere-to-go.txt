Wake up in the morning, 
 For another average day 
 I've got plans to spend my hours, 
 In another average way 
 I'll get ready, eat my breakfast, 
 Call my average ghetto friends 
 For another average ghetto situation in the end, 
 But it seems I needn't bother 
 I can hear my mobile ringin' 
 'Sin my bedroom- "What you want?" 
 "Nuffin' blood, I'm just chillin'. What you want?" 
 "Nuffin' either, ain't you got no links or nuttin'?" 
 "Na but get me from my yard, 
 "We'll find some on da roads or sum'in'." 
 Drive that motor fulla smoke 
 And the smell stickin' to my clothes 
 I'm broke and everybody knows 
 I'm drivin' with nowhere to go 
 It's clear that I'm puttin' on a show 
 Waitin' for the day that I'll blow 
 Till then you can catch me on the roads 
 Drivin' with nowhere to go 
 Now we're in the motor, 
 And we're driving five up 
 And I'm seriously hoping, 
 That the feds don't drive up 
 If they do they'll smell the smoke, 
 And find some objects made for hurtin' 
 And some brown and some white, 
 'Cause I know my ???'s working 
 Plus they'll know this car is stolen, 
 And that ain't no lucky guess 
 'Cause there's no one sittin' in it, 
 Ever passed the drivin' test 
 TDA - joy ridin' - 
 Just anotha common number 
 But if flashing lights appear, 
 I'm the first to do a runner 
 Now I'm drawin' on da zoo, 
 And I'm feeling all mong 
 We've been drivin' for a while, 
 I don't know how long 
 But I'll tell you this for free, 
 I ain't even tryin' to talk 
 And for now I'm feelin' thankful, 
 That I haven' got to walk 
 Anyway, we're just cruisin' 
 In the same ol' places 
 In the same ol' manner 
 With the same ol' faces 
 Where the same old p'lice 
 Give the same ol' chases 
 And I can't see change 
 'Cause there ain't no traces
