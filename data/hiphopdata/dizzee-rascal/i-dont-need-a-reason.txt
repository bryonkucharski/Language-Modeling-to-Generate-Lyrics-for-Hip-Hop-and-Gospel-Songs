All I do is flex, I don't need a reason 
 All I want is sex, I don't need a reason 
 Fly out on a jet, I don't need a reason 
 Every day's a never ending summer season 
 All eyes on me 
 160, blink and miss me 
 Super nifty, riding swiftly 
 Rolling through the sticks 
 Leather extra crispy, effortlessly 
 Power steering, accurately, ready for action, actually 
 Mellow, relaxed and cocking my snapback 
 Not taking no God damn back chat 
 Just racking up fat stacks 
 No ring, no chain, no fat chaps 
 I don't get no sleep, no cat naps 
 And everybody wanna be on my black sack 
 But I don't slack 
 You don't really wanna see me get abstract 
 I'll switch up the place like have that 
 Don't care about none of that rap crap 
 Steer clear of the rat trap 
 Some say that I lack tact 
 But I'm on the map 
 And I'm setting the pace, I'm on track 
 So get out my face, I'm on slapping 
 I'm on scrapping, so stop yapping, what's crackalacking? 
 Don't follow fashion, just keeping it G 
 With these hoes, macking, and that's what's happening 
 What? 
 That's what's happening 
 God bless me, nobody can't test me 
 Everyday life can't stress me, stay on the ball like Messi 
 Money and women are the only things that impress me 
 I stay fly and sexy 
 Life is a game of chess, and all the girls wanna check me 
 How much do you wanna bet me, that I never ever let a female sweat me? 
 Get me 
 I ain't gotta talk no more, cause soon as I walk in the door everybody stops doing what they're doing, don't know what they're pausing for, don't know what they're gawping for 
 Bad boy from the LDN, what the world's been calling for, been balling for 
 And your girl gets wet, stays up in the morning for 
 Don't know what you're stalling for 
 Get with the programme, I got the flow and I've got the dough and money to blow 
 And, this ain't a slow jam, ready to rock and I'm ready to roll, I'm gripping at the Trojan 
 Never gonna get caught slipping, never gonna get caught tripping 
 Never too soft on the women 
 If it ever gets too hot in the kitchen, I'm dipping, I ain't gonna stand there dripping, I'm missing 
 International, flex and go 
 When I'm at home, I stay low 
 Yo, lay in the cut, they can't see me bro 
 And I'm living it up, they can't be me though 
 Get on the mic, I get easy dough 
 When I'm cutting the cheques, 'cause I'm C.E.O 
 Keep on fronting, like you don't know 
 I stay repping the Manor, and that's E3, Bow 
 Stay with a brownin', get around the town, you better hold it down 
 I'll leave you breathing slow 
 Overstand, 'cause I ain't even clowning, I'll leave you drowning from head to toe 
 Wet, why you trying to put me in check? 
 I play for keeps, you better know I don't pet 
 Knock your head off your shoulders, no sweat, watch your step
