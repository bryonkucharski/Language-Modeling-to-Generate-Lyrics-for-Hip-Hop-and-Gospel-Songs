(Pre-hook: Robbie Williams) 
 Every single morning 
 Wake up in the afternoon 
 Cover up the mirror 
 Just to get a better view 
 Been around the world and never even left the room 
 And I, I can't figure out 
 Why? So I just scream and shout 
 (Hook: Robbie Williams) 
 I believe, I believe, I believe 
 I believe I'm going crazy 
 Going crazy, Going crazy 
 I believe I'm losing my mind 
 (Verse 1: Dizzee Rascal) 
 Everybody's looking at me, but I don't see them 
 Living for the weekend, caught in the deep end 
 Tryin'a tread water, do it for my unborn daughter 
 Lamb to the slaughter, life's getting shorter 
 Tryin'a get high off a quarter 
 I'm fly in a saucer, my life is a corker 
 Star, pop bottles, date top models 
 Middle finger in the air, not a care, going full throttle 
 Where's the love though? 
 Nobody cares about that, where's the club? Where's the drugs though? Front row 
 Follow the flow, Megaupload 
 Feel the adrenaline rush, who's the mug though? I don't know 
 (Pre-hook 2: Robbie Williams) 
 I 
 I can't figure out 
 Why? 
 So I just scream and shout? 
 (Hook: Robbie Williams) 
 (Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal) 
 Living in a bubble, my life is a puzzle 
 I'm caught in the rubble, now pass me a shovel 
 Now pass me a shot, and make it a double 
 I'm a whole lot of trouble and I don't do subtle 
 It's all or nothing, I don't wanna juggle 
 No crabs in a bucket, I don't wanna huddle 
 I've got my own name, tryn'a figure out the whole game 
 Going insane, 150 in the slow lane 
 Getting ahead of myself 
 My God, already thinking how can I better myself 
 Should I be somebody else? Should I be pacing myself? 
 My car's a rocket, and if I get too carried away, I wouldn't know when to stop it 
 (Pre-hook 2: Robbie Williams) 
 (Hook: Robbie Williams) 
 (Outro: Robbie Williams) 
 Tryin'a get a hold of 
 Tryin'a get a hold of you 
 Tryin'a get control of 
 Tryin'a get control of me
