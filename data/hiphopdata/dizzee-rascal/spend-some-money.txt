I'm just tryin' to spend some money 
 These girls tryin' to take it from me 
 (Give me that, give me that, give me that) 
 I'm just tryin' to spend some money 
 (Come on, come on, come on) 
 These girls tryin' to take it from me 
 I'm up in the club with them, I'm just like what's up 
 Getting bottles with my niggas like we don't give a fuck 
 I'm just in the club, with the bottles like what's up 
 Spending all my fucking money like we don't give a fuck 
 (Verse 1: Dizzee Rascal) 
 Hot boy, chillin' on South Beach 
 I got a pocket full of money and I don't speak 
 I let the money do the chit chat, all I do is kick back 
 In fact everything's intact 
 So I'm living it large, life large and in charge 
 I go hard, no time to recharge 
 I don't stop, I just come forth 
 All I see is pretty women and a lot of bottles on the rocks 
 I've got the premises on lock 
 Under the middle with a flush, actin' out like I'm out 
 I get the party started, or so I'm told 
 And I feel top notch, I got the top spot 
 So let the bass drop, and let the drums kick 
 Get before a man to boost and then bump it 
 All the bottles are empty 'cause we drunk it 
 And I'm wasted, mission accomplished 
 (Verse 2: Tinie Tempah) 
 Yeah yeah 
 Move ho, I'll be in the club, stop picking them leaves 
 Young niggas both sides of me, lookin' like Cluedo 
 Bitch this is Audemars, not a Hublot 
 If these niggas a beat then we sumos 
 This the new Eubank and Frank Bruno 
 White girls getting pregnant like Juno 
 Private jet so let me go Pluto 
 Yeah it's a grand whole life, freakin cinematic 
 I'm in the SLS, fuck it if I'm in the traffic 
 Great stone then I lay with those 20 ratchets 
 Black rock star, bitches call me Lenny Kravitz 
 I'm just tryin' to spend some money 
 These girls tryin' to take it from me 
 (Give me that, give me that, give me that) 
 I'm just tryin' to spend some money 
 (Come on, come on, come on) 
 These girls tryin' to take it from me 
 I'm up in the club with them, I'm just like what's up 
 Getting bottles with my niggas like we don't give a fuck 
 I'm just in the club, with the bottles like what's up 
 Spending all my fucking money like we don't' give a fuck 
 (Verse 3: Dizzee Rascal) 
 Grey Goose in my tummy 
 I'm tryin' to do the doggy but it just looks funny 
 Still I look like money, dress to impress 
 Looking for some double D, breast in a low pot dress 
 And then I put that body to the test 
 North to south east, to west I progress, I'm the best 
 I know I ain't settling for less 
 She knows what I want, she ain't gotta second guess 
 Took her to the hotel, she was with her home girl 
 Had to get rid of your girl like oh well 
 Baby it's a cold world, get in the jacuzzi 
 Smoke some of this and get woozy 
 Think her name was Jane but it could've been Julie 
 Really don't matter 'cause I still let her do me 
 Really a truly, it was all that 
 I paid for the rat ta ta ta ta, from the back now 
 I'm just tryin' to spend some money 
 These girls tryin' to take it from me 
 (Give me that, give me that, give me that) 
 I'm just tryin' to spend some money 
 (Come on, come on, come on) 
 These girls tryin' to take it from me 
 I'm up in the club with them, I'm just like what's up 
 Getting bottles with my niggas like we don't give a fuck 
 I'm just in the club, with the bottles like what's up 
 Spending all my fucking money like we don't' give a fuck
