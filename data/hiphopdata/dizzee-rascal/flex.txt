 And never ever stop, stop, stop

 And let me see you rock, rock, rock 
 I wind upon ya hip, hip, hip 
 And never ever stop, stop, stop 
 I love it when you flex like that 
 Slow, fast, up, down, bring it back

 Slow, fast, up, down, bring it back

 Slow, fast, up, down, bring it back 
 I love it when I see a pretty girl winding 
 I can even watch a butters girl grindin' 
 Control the body with great timing 
 Ain't shy in the dark, there shining, 
 Does someat to me when I see her vibes in 
 Drop it like it's hot, you got my tings rising 
 So frequent, there's no disguising 
 What d'you expect, that ain't surprising. 
 These girls get my blood pressure rising 
 They're wiggling 'n' jiggling, I'm hidin' 
 Checkin' them back offers so them fightin' 
 So natural girls, so excitin' 
 Gotta bit on dis, don't wanna get right in. 
 'Tis better now, widda mandem fightin' 
 Never ever shit, no matter scores risin' 
 'Scuse me, you really gotta say somethin' 
 I love it when you flex like that 
 Slow, fast, up, down, bring it back

 Girlfriend, how you whine like that, 
 Beautiful. you look so fine like that, 
 Ain't seen her for a long time like that, 
 You should go to jail for a crime like that. 
 Buss up the floor, you don't cut no slack, 
 Dancehall King, you're not at all laid back. 
 Make up for what the uvva girls lack, 
 Look so good, you got me going off ch... ch.ch, track.

 While ma heartbeats going rat-at-tat-tat 
 So serious, ya got me ill like that 
 Temperature rising y'know, I feel like that.

 Gosh golly, my oh my 
 Hoping that you ain't looking at any other guy 
 Your figure is so pleasin' to the eye 
 Especially when you do the bubble or the butterfly. 
 See a bit of sweat drippin' down your thigh 
 But somehow, you still stay high an' dry. 
 Gosh, ya make a Rude Boi so shy 
 Got the whole club sayin' my oh my 
 Please don't stop, please don't stop, give it 
 If not, show me how I gotta get wiv it 
 You're da best, I ain't scared to admit it 
 What's the deal, you're looking at me like izzit? 
 But ya won't know less ya come pay a visit 
 Life's too short to be cautious, innit 
 Don't just stand on the edge, come live it 
 I love it when you flex like that 
 Slow, fast, up, down, bring it back 
 I love it when you move like that 
 Slow, fast, up, down, bring it back 
 I love it when you whine like that 
 Slow, fast, up, down, bring it back 
 I love it when you flex like that 
 Slow, fast, up, down, bring it back
