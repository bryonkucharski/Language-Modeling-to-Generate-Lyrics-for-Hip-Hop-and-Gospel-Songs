I wake up, every day is a daydream 
 Everythin' in my life ain't what it seems 
 I wake up just to go back to sleep 
 I act real shallow but I'm in too deep 
 And all I care about is sex and violence 
 A heavy bass line is my kind of silence 
 Everybody says that I've gotta get a grip 
 But I let sanity give me the slip 
 Some people think I'm bonkers 
 But I just think I'm free 
 Man, I'm just living my life 
 There's nothin' crazy about me 
 Some people pay for thrills 
 But I get mine for free 
 Man, I'm just livin' my life 
 There's nothing crazy 'bout me 
 (Bonkers)

 There's nothing crazy 'bout me 
 Mmm, yeah, I'm back in the floor now 
 I wake up, every day is a daydream 
 Everythin' in my life ain't what it seems

 Bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon
