 Life's too short to be livin' with stress 
 I'm too young to be all depressed 
 I can't complain, I'm highly blessed 
 And there's one thing that I want to get off my chest 
 I'm free as a bird, I'm high as a kite 
 I could do what I want, and I'm doing alright 
 That's why I just might celebrate tonight 
 And if you ain't down with it, then get on your bike 
 To sank elsewhere, who the hell cares 
 I'm in great shape, you need health care 
 If you can't say something nice, then keep quiet 
 Or come to the club, there's girls there 
 I'm goin' to rave 'til six in the mornin' 
 I can already hear the bassline callin' 
 Just make up your mind, stop stallin' 
 And don't be half assed, 'cause I'm all in 
 So if your wallet ain't fat, don't worry about it 
 Your car don't work, we can go without it 
 We don't need wheels, just the will to party 
 I'll take you there, don't doubt it 
 (Dance, I'll take you there) 
 Disco, disco, disco, disco 
 (Dance, I'll take you there) 
 (Dance, I'll take you there) 
 Disco, disco, disco, disco 
 (Dance, I'll take you there) 
 Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go 
 You wanna drink? It's on me 
 Coca-cola, JD 
 I don't care about VIP 
 'Cause the middle of the dance floor's cool with me 
 I wanna shock tonight 
 I wanna rock tonight 
 Come love, let me be the robot tonight 
 So many damn girls lookin' hot tonight 
 So before I leave here, I wanna cop tonight 
 So I can't just stand up against the wall 
 Try'na play it cool, feelin' like a fool 
 Like I'm scared to dance, 'cause I ain't scared at all 
 So there's no point lookin' all miserable 
 So I've got a big grin on my face 
 And my hands on a pretty girl's waist 
 Beer budget and champagne taste 
 But I feel like I'm running this place 
 So if your wallet ain't fat, don't worry about it 
 Your car don't work, we can go without it 
 We don't need wheels, just the will to party 
 I'll take you there, don't doubt it 
 (Dance, I'll take you there) 
 Disco, disco, disco, disco 
 (Dance, I'll take you there) 
 (Dance, I'll take you there) 
 Disco, disco, disco, disco 
 (Dance, I'll take you there) 
 Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go 
 Come, follow me to the place 
 We can party all night, yeah 
 Leave your worries behind (let's party) 
 We've only got your star if only for tonight (show the world!) 
 Show the world you can shine (that's right!) 
 Everyone's happy so there'll be no drama tonight 
 There's always yours to define 
 So let down your hair and prepare for the time of your life 
 The time of your life, yeah 
 Brrrrrrr-aaaah! 
 Oooooooh-aaaah! 
 I'm feelin' myself right now 
 Really revealin' myself right now 
 I'm actin' a fool, and I think it's all good 
 I wouldn't be nowhere else if I could 
 I don't ever wanna go home, let's stay 
 Party all night and party all day 
 What do you say? Tell me you're on it 
 Drink 'til we can't stand up, then vomit 
 Quicker than a comet, I feel like a star 
 Everyone waves, they know who we are 
 So much love, so much dread 
 Tell me you don't feel like a tomboy 
 In fact don't tell me nothing, just skank 
 'Cause I got a shawty and shizz in the bank 
 No need to thank, the pleasure is mine 
 We should try do this again some time 
 And if your wallet ain't fat, don't worry about it 
 Your car don't work, we can go without it 
 We don't need wheels, just the will to party 
 I'll take you there, don't doubt it 
 (Dance, I'll take you there) 
 Disco, disco, disco, disco 
 (Dance, I'll take you there) 
 (Dance, I'll take you there) 
 Disco, disco, disco, disco 
 (Dance, I'll take you there) 
 Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go-o-o-o
