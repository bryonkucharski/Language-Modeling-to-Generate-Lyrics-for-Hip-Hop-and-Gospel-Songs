 Been there, done that, had that, what 
 He's got a Nokia, take that, what 
 Big mouth, loud mouth, watch that, what 
 Pretty girl, buff girl, doggy that, what 
 Dizzee Rascal's on the format, what 
 Badminders get a backslap, what

 Girlfriend, wifey, bang that, what 
 You can't know me, know that, what 
 Dedication, we show that, what 
 Chucking MCs like stones 
 Bad boy forever like Sean Puffy Combs

 Set trends, get girls like Tom Jones 
 Break bones at your house wifey's home 
 Yeah his wifey don't leave me alone 
 That boy's arrogant, set for the chrome 
 Come barefoot like Fred Flinstone 
 You got a big gun? Come bring it out 
 Butterfly knife, come along fling it out 
 We can just do it old school, swing it out 
 I suggest you best stop, wing it out 
 Who's that? What's that? Boydem about? 
 Yeah man, quick man, start spreading out 
 Kidnapped, take 'em Rascal's hideout 
 Cold sweat, take a nap, get burnt out 
 Boys, girls start moving

 Got a screwface all night, all day 
 Screwface keeps bredas at bay 
 Screwface means keep well away, stay away 
 Screwface means get out my way 
 Screwface means you don't know me 
 What you looking at, what's your beef? 
 Screwface means I'm not having it 
 Screwface means I'm not a chief 
 Screwface means I'm not happy right now 
 That's why no smile was used 
 Screwface means I'm not pleased 
 Screwface means I'm not amused 
 Screwface means I just wanna walk not talk 
 Screwface means I just wanna leave 
 When I activate my screwface give me space 
 Screwface means let me breathe 
 I got sick flows, make an MC have to walk on his tip-toes 
 Life ain't always nice, that's how shit goes 
 You know we're going on black 'cause we're blick rows 
 And I can't be seen with these sick hoes 
 Where did I stay last night? I bet your chick knows 
 We were not knocking the boots, we kicked toes 
 Your girl's the same as all bimbos, freaks and nymphos 
 I've got an idea, make dough on the spot I mean right here 
 Nike air girls, I got paper for the whole year 
 You can bring drama 'cause I got no fear 
 And my head feels so clear 
 Move to the mic, MC's are like, "Oh dear" 
 Some try catching me up but they're not near 
 Not ever, not now and not here, we're too hot here 
 Look, girls, ladies do the butterfly 
 Shake your batty low, shake your batty high 
 Don't ask me who, where, when or why 
 Wanna see your batty rise high to the sky 
 Look, girls, ladies do the butterfly 
 Shake your batty low, shake your batty high 
 Don't ask me who, where, when or why 
 Wanna see your batty rise high to the sky
