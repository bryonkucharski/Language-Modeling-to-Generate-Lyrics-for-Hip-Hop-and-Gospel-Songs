Callin' all workers 
 Time to put your working on the dance floor 
 Stop moaning 
 I don't wanna hear nothing, let's go 
 And pro and so, it's off to work, I go 
 No flow, no show, no go, okay, it's off to work, I go 
 And pro and so, it's off to work, I go 
 No flow, no show, no go, okay, it's off to work, I go, okay 
 On top above all I flow Fabian way, beyond control 
 Lyrical pro, no, full time hustler out for the dough 
 Put my lifetime of grime in rhymes 
 Rudeboy, these are turbulent times 
 Some of you invest in Glocks or nines 
 I've seen no definite stop signs 
 On top above all and real, ain't afraid to show how I feel 
 Ain't afraid to kill bill, keep in touch with the stainless steel 
 Ain't too many doing it like bill 
 With all my concept hustling skill 
 Exceptional, respect me still 
 If not hold your corner and chill 
 And pro and so, it's off to work, I go 
 No flow, no show, no go, okay, it's off to work, I go 
 And pro and so, it's off to work, I go 
 No flow, no show, no go, okay, it's off to work, I go 
 On top above all I flex, come clear I don't fear whose next 
 (No) 
 Hot like tex mex but I gotta keep my cool to get cheques 
 Musics simple but its complex 
 Out of the blue everybody gets vex [unverified] 
 Tainted love without the corsets 
 On top above all I rain 
 Think of my heart I rule my own brain 
 Vigilant mind frame 
 That's the easy way to maintain 
 Otherwise go ahead act insane 
 If not do the best to obtain 
 Long jeopardy in this fucked up game 
 Extreme levels of pleasure and pain 
 And pro and so, it's off to work, I go 
 No flow, no show, no go, okay, it's off to work, I go 
 And pro and so, it's off to work, I go 
 No flow, no show, no go, okay, it's off to work, I go 
 Born in a quoir floss on the low 
 Flat broke never know 
 Forever grow, forever king 
 Trying without bling bling 
 Whatever long term hustler forever doe 
 Forever glow, superstar I've gone clear 
 To ever iroe solo your never near, I'm sincere 
 But fear, whatever name up for year I'm here [unverified] 
 Forever ill stick it and steer 
 Forever whatever the postcode or path 
 Let's not cross find out for a laugh 
 Your never gonna stop my graft [unverified] 
 I'm too clever don't be daft 
 And pro and so, it's off to work, I go 
 No flow, no show, no go, okay, it's off to work, I go 
 And pro and so, it's off to work, I go 
 No flow, no show, no go, okay, it's off to work, I go 
 Just listen to the lyrics, you don't need to ask for them 
 Use your ears, that's what I've just done 
 Maybe a couple of bits I got wrong 
 But fuck it, there is most of it
