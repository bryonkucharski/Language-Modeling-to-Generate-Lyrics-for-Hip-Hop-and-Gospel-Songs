(Intro: Dizzee Rascal) 
 New York, LA, Tokyo, Berlin, Miami, Rio, Milan, Ibiza 
 I love all these places, but there's no place like home 
 I love my city 
 (Verse 1: Dizzee Rascal) 
 I go hard in the city of London 
 I get a lot of love, all smiles when I step in the function 
 I'm a local boy, I'm from the east side 
 Now I'm jet settin, I'm reppin, I'll do it worldwide 
 When I was a kid there was a rough ride 
 Barely had the money for a bus ride, now I'm on the upside 
 Having a ball with all the breders I grew up with 
 A couple of women I'm in the club with 
 Bottle the bubbly, feeling lovely, women are hugging me 
 Nobody could tell me nothing and nobody can never trouble me 
 It's all good, pure positive vibes 
 For the most part everybody's just tryna live their lives 
 We're not afraid to die, only the strong survive 
 You don't know if you don't try, the stakes are high 
 And it's the city where I earned my crown 
 God knows that I love this town 
 (Hook: Teddy Sky) 
 The city lights are extra bright 
 They shine for us tonight 
 The streets are so alive right now 
 I freakin love this town 
 Let me buy you another round 
 And show you how my peeps get down 
 The streets are so alive right now 
 I freaking love this town 
 (Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal) 
 It's just one big melting pot 
 Every creed colour and race, we got the lot 
 And I love to shop, there's not a brand that can't be copped 
 No more than a couple of stops 
 Where should I begin? 
 Might see me in the west side getting it in 
 Might see me on the north side getting a trim 
 South side of the river in a race car having a spin, I just win 
 And I'm never gonna lose with the city to guide me 
 Got the vibe of the city inside me and the streets are lively 
 Got a whole lot of love and I'm connect it 
 It's 7 million people behind me, don't try me 
 'Cause right now we're gonna rave it up 
 Set the roof on fire and blaze it up 
 And we're in it to win it 
 There's no limit so we raise it up 
 We got the dancefloor shaking like, woo
