Get your passport and your bikini 
 You need a holiday, come see me 
 I know you're tired of the same old scenery 
 And I could change all that so easily 
 Don't worry about a thing girl, take a chance 
 I'll take you to the South of France like Cannes 
 If anyone can, I can 
 Or we can go shopping in Milan 
 I just hope you understand 
 I hope you see it clear 
 It really don't matter how far or near 
 'Cause there's no distance that could stop my persistence 
 It's just a few days in the year 
 Plus I've got clout so let's ride out 
 We ain't gotta fly, we can just drive out 
 We can have a rave or we can hire out 
 Won't tell nobody, let them find out 
 If you ain't doing nothing, let's fly away 
 (Drive away, get away) 
 We can go to the club or hide away 
 We can do what you want to, baby 
 If you ain't doing nothing, let's fly away 
 (Drive away, take a holiday) 
 We can go to the club or hide away 
 We can do what you want to, baby 
 Don't watch my passport photo 
 I know I look a bit loco 
 And I know that my Spanish is so-so 
 But let's try keep that on the low-low 
 'Cause we're going Ibiza 
 I've got friends that really wanna meet ya 
 With champagne and a whole lot of (love) 
 It's all good, darling, in the Blue Marlin 
 And I'll never let your belly get empty 
 Even when your belly's full, you're still sexy 
 We can ride speed boats, we can ride jet skis 
 I'll show you the time of your life if you let me 
 I just want to put a smile on your pretty face 
 If I didn't, it would just be a pretty waste 
 So you look like a girl with a bit of taste 
 So I couldn't take you just any place 
 If you ain't doing nothing, let's fly away 
 Drive away, get away 
 We can go to the club or hide away 
 We can do what you want to, baby 
 If you ain't doing nothing, let's fly away 
 Drive away, take a holiday 
 We can go to the club or hide away 
 We can do what you want to, baby 
 I know you're really busy and I know you've got plans 
 But are you really too busy for a sun tan? 
 I ain't talking about walking down the high street 
 I'm talking about laying on a bright white beach 
 With a Pina Colada or whatever you'd rather 
 White wine, that's fine, just give me a lager 
 Then after, we'll take a truck to the night spot 
 The hot spot, the top spot 
 Party around the clock 
 And when we get there, it's strictly VIP 
 No need for ID, security know me 
 No waiting in line, no high entry fee 
 Don't worry about nothing when you're beside me 
 I'll get you lively and loosen you up 
 Have a bit of champagne, it'll boost you up 
 I wanna move you up, I wanna take you away 
 So in other words darling, what do you say? 
 If you ain't doing nothing, let's fly away 
 Drive away, get away 
 We can go to the club or hide away 
 We can do what you want to, baby 
 If you ain't doing nothing, let's fly away 
 Drive away, take a holiday 
 We can go to the club or hide away 
 We can do what you want to, baby
