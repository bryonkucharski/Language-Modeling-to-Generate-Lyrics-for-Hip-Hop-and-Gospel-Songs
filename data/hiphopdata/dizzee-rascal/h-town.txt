(Intro: Dizzee Rascal) 
 Yo, you know I can't forget about H-town 
 Down South family 
 Texas (woop) 
 Holdin' me down from young 
 Trust me, trust me, trust me, yo 
 (Hook: Dizzee Rascal) 
 Keepin' it trill 
 In the home of the brave 
 Chillin' wit' the OG 
 UGK 
 Rollin' up swishers, and I smoke till I faint 
 Draped up whilst hitting them switches in the car all covered in candy paint 
 I'm rollin' round H-Town 
 Where Texas mandem hold me down 
 I'm rollin' round H-Town where 
 Where Texas mandem hold me down 
 I'm tollin' round H-Town 
 Where Texas mandem hold me down 
 I said, rollin' round H-Town 
 (Verse 1: Dizzee Rascal) 
 I'm rollin' round H-Town 
 Texas mandem hold me down 
 Actin' an arse, yeah I fool around 
 You know it's all mad when I'm in town 
 No I don't drink that purple juice 
 DJ Screw got me feelin' loose 
 Might put a diamond in my tooth 
 I've got a lot of money, that's my excuse 
 Sitting in the slab with Trill OG 
 Holding a smoke in a big old tree 
 Looking for a girl with a big old B 
 And she can swallow these nuts ASAP 
 I've got an attitude like Pimp C 
 These hoes ain't getting no sympathy 
 And breddas better not talk shit to me 
 Cause that's a good way to get an injury 
 Whole lot of goons and whole lot of guns 
 Now we're in the strip club, throwing up a lot of ones 
 There's a whole lot of titties and a whole lot of bums 
 Yeah the down south breddas, they're a whole lot of fun 
 And I'm always on a hype when I come, there's a whole lot of sure and I never wanna leave, the party's never done 
 We just take it to the parking lot, and then we laugh a lot, until they call the cops, yo 
 (Hook: Dizzee Rascal) 
 (Verse 2: Bun B) 
 Man, got a call from a boy from the boy from London 
 Young Diz, what it do my G? 
 Said he wanna come down to the states 
 You already know that's cool with me 
 I'm in H-town posted up 
 Let's get some drinks, toast it up 
 Hit up the scene and light up some green 
 And burn that purp till we roasted, what 
 Pick rudeboy up the Jag 
 Fresh as fuck and we got the swag 
 And we rollin' clean 
 And we acting bad 
 And these boys wanna hate, why you mad? 
 Gladiators stay on deck 
 You don't want them boys catch your wreck 
 'Cause they'll bus your face 
 And they'll break your neck 
 You better back up bitch and show respect 
 Before your ass get checked 
 (Hook: Dizzee Rascal) 
 (Verse 3: Trae The Truth) 
 When I pull up in the city in a back of a slab 
 I got a late night bitch saying come out the cab 
 I'll have a whole trunk going off like jabs 
 Nigga everything paid, I ain't got no tabs 
 Do this here for Texas, that's my city 
 Diamonds all in my chain, they cost like 50 
 Yeah, I'm up in the gutter where niggas play gritty 
 Ain't nothing here pretty 
 We bad like Diddy 
 Everything screwed up where I'm from, slow it up 
 R.I.P. Big Moe, everybody pouring up 
 When I throw the hood up, everybody shown up 
 If I make it out the gate, everybody blowing up 
 I'mma do this here for my nigga Dizzee Rascal 
 King of the streets, here to block my castle 
 I'll tell the whole world, go ahead and respect it 
 I've got this bitch like it ain't no hassle 
 (Hook: Dizzee Rascal)
