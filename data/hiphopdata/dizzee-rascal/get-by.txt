(Intro: Dizzee Rascal) 
 To each 'n' every kind, 
 (London ghetto, Birmingham ghetto) 
 Every ghetto frame of mind, 
 (Manchester ghetto, Newton ghetto) 
 To each 'n' every kind, 
 (Leeds ghetto, Liverpool ghetto) 
 Every ghetto frame of mind, 
 (UK ghetto, East London ghetto) 
 To each of every kind, 
 (North London ghetto, West London ghetto,) 
 Wiv a ghetto frame of mind, 
 (South London ghetto) 
 To each 'n' every kind, 
 It's rasket, wiv a ghetto frame of mind, 
 Look yo 
 (Verse One: Dizzee Rascal) 
 We grew up in da ghetto, where summertime's short 
 Straight action, you don't stop for a thought 
 Most use crime as a way to pay the bills 
 The unlucky ones end up gettin' caught 
 We grew up in da ghetto, where the goin' gets rough 
 Money's been around, but it's never been enough 
 Most ain't given no choice but to hustle 
 Some break down when the going gets tough 
 Deep in da manna, there's all kinds of different people 
 Minorities still struggle to be equal 
 So many characters, four main types 
 The good, the bad, the ugly, 'n' the evil 
 Deep in da manna, where da poverty's visible 
 There's not a lot sweet, so most look miserable 
 Most cave in to the devil, took the wrong path 
 Some kept their faith, 'n' still pray for a miracle 
 Soccer stars emerge from da curb 
 Up 'n' comin' MCs struggle to be heard 
 Boy dem, dey searchin' for da next jailbird 
 Fuck, talk, murder 'n' they live by their word 
 Shotters keep da money goin' round 
 Kids go astray, most never get found 
 I've noticed there's a ghetto in every town 
 'N' the skies are empty, because da stars are on da ground 
 (Chorus: Vanya) 
 Sometimes I'm lost, look up at the sky 
 Sometimes I feel to cry, but somehow I still get by 
 Sometimes I'm lost, askin' myself why 
 Sometimes I feel to cry, but somehow I still get by 
 (Verse Two: Dizzee Rascal) 
 We grew up in the ghetto, saw real life pain 
 Real life struggle, wiv real life strain 
 Real life kiddies, wiv real life guns 
 'N' real life mothers lose real life sons 
 Gang wars erupting on the dance floor Seasons, 
 Beef after beef, jus' to be da top geezers, 
 Big arm slash, hit da Stratford bricks 
 Ghetto high brudas, gotta maintain reps 
 What's that all about, I ask my self before I swing 
 More time, I'm beefin' over any little thing 
 Beef in any area, region or vicinity 
 My ghetto frame of mind makes me prone to hostility 
 To many brethrens locked up, too many young baby mothers 
 Each 'n' every crew 'n' colour, ghetto sisters and brothers 
 If you know your from da slums, keep reppin' no doubt 
 Stay ghetto if you must, just remember to get out 
 (Chorus: Vanya) 
 Sometimes I'm lost, look up at the sky 
 Sometimes I feel to cry, but somehow I still get by 
 Sometimes I'm lost, askin' myself why 
 Sometimes I feel to cry, but somehow I still get by 
 Sometimes I feel to cry, look up at the sky, get by
