Rude boy, don't watch that 
 'Cause if it's arms-house, I'll rock that 
 And if it's on top, you know I got that 
 Come through with a big baseball bat 
 Like blood, don't make me get old skool 
 Blood, don't make me get old skool 
 Blood, don't make me get old skool 
 Blood, don't make me get old skool 
 Stop rollin' with that bredder, you don't need him 
 He's a pussy'ole, he's a chief, leave him 
 Stop rollin' with that bredder, you don't need him 
 He ain't got your back, if it's beef leave him 
 Why you rollin' with that pussy'ole? 
 Movin' with that pussy'ole? 
 You know that he's a pussy'ole 
 I showed you he's a pussy'ole 
 He's always been a pussy'ole 
 So he'll always be a pussy'ole 
 But you're still with that pussy'ole 
 You must be a pussy'ole 
 That's that bredder always frontin' like he's strong 
 Sneaky fake fuck always runnin' to his brother when it's on 
 Hardly backs the beef, last one swingin' 
 First one runnin', makin' up stories, he's a chief 
 Bringin' bredders to the ends, actin' up 
 Puttin' on a show, tryin' talk funny to his friends 
 But he's really not a don, they know it 
 And you know it, so something must be seriously wrong 
 'Cause you're parrin', his mum calls you darlin' 
 But his brother has got you shottin' with no way of stoppin' 
 I heard you both had beef with an older brer 
 You took a spark and he just stood there 
 Now that boy's a pussy'ole, say it ain't true 
 It started because of him and ended with you 
 And that's the kind of shit that's gonna continue 
 But I guess it don't matter if that's what you're into 
 Stop rollin' with that bredder, you don't need him 
 He's a pussy'ole, he's a chief, leave him 
 Stop rollin' with that bredder, you don't need him 
 He ain't got your back, if it's beef leave him 
 Why you rollin' with that pussy'ole? 
 Movin' with that pussy'ole? 
 You know that he's a pussy'ole 
 I showed you he's a pussy'ole 
 He's always been a pussy'ole 
 So he'll always be a pussy'ole 
 But you're still with that pussy'ole 
 You must be a pussy'ole 
 The sun's the biggest star in the sky 
 But naturally it's gotta make room for the moon every night 
 Everything's got its time limit, even relationships 
 Everything's sunny when the friendship's tight 
 A friend in need is a friend indeed 
 But a friend with no money and no weed 
 Can flip the script at a ridiculous speed 
 And make a best friend an ex-friend for the P 
 A couple of years ago in my road youth days 
 I was into pirate radio, I guess it was a phase 
 There was this one particular MC man 
 Was a older in my ends and I thought he was the dan 
 So I started rollin' with him kind of like a little brother 
 My cousin used to say he was a pussy undercover 
 I didn't think that it was nothin' more than jealousy 
 But I wish I would've listened every time he told me 
 Stop rollin' with that bredder, you don't need him 
 He's a pussy'ole, he's a chief, leave him 
 Stop rollin' with that bredder, you don't need him 
 He ain't got your back, if it's beef leave him 
 Why you rollin' with that pussy'ole? 
 Movin' with that pussy'ole? 
 You know that he's a pussy'ole 
 I showed you he's a pussy'ole 
 He's always been a pussy'ole 
 So he'll always be a pussy'ole 
 But you're still with that pussy'ole 
 You must be a pussy'ole 
 (Hook: Change Of Beat) 
 Pussy'ole 
 Pussy'ole 
 Pussy'ole 
 Pussy'ole 
 Stay away from them pussy'oles, you can have it all 
 Live endlessly, tremendous, forever ball 
 Stand up for something or for anything you'll fall 
 But differently, know when not to lose your cool 
 'Cause it ain't what you show, it's what you're concealin' 
 Put a smile on the deepest negative feelin' 
 Stand tall even when they're hatin' and they're schemin' 
 Then watch your money rise right to the ceilin' 
 Stand tall even when they're hatin' and they're schemin' 
 Then watch your money rise right to the ceilin' 
 Stop rollin' with that bredder, you don't need him 
 He's a pussy'ole, he's a chief, leave him 
 Stop rollin' with that bredder, you don't need him 
 He ain't got your back, if it's beef leave him 
 Why you rollin' with that pussy'ole? 
 Movin' with that pussy'ole? 
 You know that he's a pussy'ole 
 I showed you he's a pussy'ole 
 He's always been a pussy'ole 
 So he'll always be a pussy'ole 
 But you're still with that pussy'ole 
 You must be a pussy'ole
