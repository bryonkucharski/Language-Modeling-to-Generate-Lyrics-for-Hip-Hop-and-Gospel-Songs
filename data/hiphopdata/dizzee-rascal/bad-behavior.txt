I'm doin' it major with the bad behavior (x8) 
 I'm a popular player, these girls know how I do 
 If they ain't comin' alone I'm happy leaving with two 
 I act like I ain't got a clue, but I know the cue 
 And if I'm totally honest, it really ain't nothin' new 
 I'm on the club scene looking for love 
 I mean looking for women that's thrillin' or willin' to get in the tub 
 Champagne, bubble bath, sex, and all the above 
 She could powder her nose, but I'll be skippin' the drugs 
 I might have a little smoke, plus a little joke 
 I hope if I ask nicely, she'll give me deep throat 
 If not, there's the front door, don't forget your coat (Move!) 
 Don't come back, I don't ever want to see you, beau 
 Back to the club, I'm bobbin' and weavin' 
 Grab a girl, it's nothin' long, we're leavin' 
 Goin' to my hotel room for a meetin' 
 Wake up the neighbors, no body sleepin'! 
 Doin' it major, I'm doin' it major 
 Money money money and bad behavior 
 Doin' it major, I'm doin' it major 
 Lookin' for a girl that'll do me a favor 
 Doin' it major, I'm doin' it major 
 Money money money and bad behavior 
 So fresh (unclear) trainers 
 I shine like a star, too bad for my haters 
 Doin' it major with the bad behavior 
 Doin' it major with the bad behavior 
 Doin' it major with the bad behavior 
 Bad behavior, bad behavior 
 I live the super star life: young, rich, and I'm famous 
 Got no time for no body talkin' out of their anus (No!) 
 Lookin' for a lady willin' to get after some capers 
 It's a no-brainer, even if I was brainless 
 All I know is money, guns, clothes, cars, and women 
 And God knows that that's a recipe for sinnin' 
 But on the flip side it's a recipe for winnin' 
 I do 130 in a Porche Turbo grinnin' 
 I'm speedin', I'm burnin' rubber 
 With my super star girl I'm a super star lover 
 Three's not a crowd, there's room for another 
 There's queer sister and her lesbian lover 
 The girl's in luck, I'm untucked, it don't stop 
 Missionary, doggy, and whatnot, they all drop 
 Seven years on the chart and I'm still hot 
 Wanna know how I'm doin' it? I'll tell you what: 
 Doin' it major, I'm doin' it major 
 Money money money and bad behavior 
 Doin' it major, I'm doin' it major 
 Lookin' for a girl that'll do me a favor 
 Doin' it major, I'm doin' it major 
 Money money money and bad behavior 
 So fresh (unclear) trainers 
 I shine like a star, too bad for my haters 
 I get a blow job drivin', slippin' and slide 
 In between the traffic in the bus lane gettin' high 
 I'm over the limit but I'm overly in it 
 And if I see police, I'm gonna have to wing it 
 I'm breakin' the law, breakin' the law 
 Put the pedal to the floor till it can't take it no more 
 And if you ever try a thing, then I'm breakin' your jaw 
 Put my hand behind your head and smack your face on the floor 
 I want a two-way mirror with a midget behind it 
 And I hid the camera so no body could find it 
 In my sex dungeon we could make a movie 
 With my favorite groupie, yeah, she's a beauty 
 She's a pretty young thing, yeah, she's a cutey 
 Double D breasts and her bottom is juicy 
 Got me runnin' round the place like Kriss Akabusi 
 With my wanger hangin' out, 'cause I'm ballin' loosely (Ballin'!) 
 Doin' it major, I'm doin' it major 
 Money money money and bad behavior 
 Doin' it major, I'm doin' it major 
 Lookin' for a girl that'll do me a favor 
 Doin' it major, I'm doin' it major 
 Money money money and bad behavior 
 So fresh (unclear) trainers 
 I shine like a star, too bad for my haters
