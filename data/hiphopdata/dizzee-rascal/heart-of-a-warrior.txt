(Hook: Teddy Sky) 
 I will fight till I take my last breath 
 I got the heart of a warrior 
 The heart of a warrior 
 I've been down, I've been out and I bled 
 I got the heart of a warrior 
 The heart of a warrior 
 I'll never back down 
 (Verse 1: Dizzee Rascal) 
 Born fearless, leavin' when it's delirious 
 Superstar and super serious 
 Runnin' the game like I was born gearless 
 Deeper guy, I got the beat to live 'em earless 
 Still I know that they still hear us 
 Only rap, we make an appearance 
 So I shout, shout, let it out 
 Remain tearless 'cause I'm careless 
 Doing it for the man dem in the hoodies and the new eras 
 Young ragamuffin, can't tell me nothing 
 Miss me with that huff and puffing 
 You ain't ready to buck and get stuck in 
 You're just doing a lot of chuckin 
 I'm just doing a lot of talkin' 
 Are you sick or something? 
 Are you thick or something? 
 You should think of ducking 
 Hit you with that nunchukka 
 I Bruce Lee your fly kick 
 Jump up and Tom pop and I've got something 
 Nigga they comin' hard for they food 
 Don't wanna see me switch and lose my cool 
 'Cause I be up with that fool, hard but you have to smooth, I be actin' a fool 
 I be actin' a fool... I be actin' a fool... I be actin' a fool... I be actin' a fool... 
 (Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal) 
 When the bumper clean shake the earth right underneath 
 Pick up the devil sides and let them call me thunder feet 
 If you want a war I'm not the one to meet, I'm not sure I'm the sweet 
 I'm like a tropic in the summer, come with heat 
 Not to blow my own brass but I'm having a blast 
 Spendin my paper fast 
 Think I'm movin around, start havin' a laugh 
 Competition's lookin' over bars and I'm last nice 
 Be fragile, reppin the underclass 
 Miss me with your problems 'cause I can't be yours 
 Who Jeremy call, I look at the wall 
 You star, we size 'em all 
 You like to profile, you just a child that's in denial 
 Now you're on trial 
 You should bring the mind with me while we're flexin 
 Good with nothing but a swagger and the crooked fall 
 Hentai but never get rinced out 'cause I stay fresh out 
 No doubt, don't say no 
 I'm giving a proper, keep a pitch out 
 I'm sittin' here, I don't think about her 
 I'm black tie, I'm tweeted up 
 It's amazing what you can when you put your finger up 
 (Bridge: Teddy Sky) 
 Now now I was way through the fire 
 Yeah yeah I got the eye of the tiger 
 So tell me, what's gonna stop me now 
 God knows that I put in the hours 
 I can't lose now, I got the power 
 Be at the top blowin' smoke in the sky 
 But I'mma take it just a little bit higher
