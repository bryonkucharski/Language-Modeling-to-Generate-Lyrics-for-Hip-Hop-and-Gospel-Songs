Yo 'cause 
 Whagwaan fam? 
 What you got there? 
 Oi 
 Is that a lemon? 
 No it's cheese cuzzie 
 Hey join me? 
 What I just lit it fam! 
 Oh don't be shy! 
 Fuck sake 
 Are you movin to my girl though? 
 I might do still! 
 She's loose bruv 
 Ah shut up! 
 We're Just Chillin' wiv da man dem 
 Jammin wiv da man dem 
 It's all good in the hood wiv da man dem 
 I know a couple girldem maybe I shall bell dem 
 Till then I'm just chillin' wiv da man dem 
 Jammin wiv da man dem 
 It's all good in the hood wiv da man dem 
 I know a couple girldem maybe I shall bell dem 
 Till them I'm just chillin' wiv da, chillin' wiv da 
 I was in the e3vo playin' pro evo 
 Gettin' moved up in the scores for a zero 
 If I lose again I will surely regret it 
 'Cause this pussyole won't let me forget it 
 But it's no pressure I can take this boi 
 And if I don't win I'll break dis boi 
 I'm just rampin we've got an understandin 
 We could never be arms out that's ma brederin 
 Through thick and thin, rain sleet hail snow he's chippin in 
 If he's got a couple gash he'll bring me in 
 If he's got a bit of weed I'm smokin' 
 I ain't jokin 
 From day one we was on this road ting 
 Now we're all grown up on the old ting 
 Kick back take it easy and slow ting 
 It's the kind of thing we're promotin 
 No job ting 
 When I get lost 
 Feel I've been crossed 
 The man dem are my salvation 
 I take off my shoes 
 Fill up a zoot 
 And put on the playstation 
 So stop button bashing just pass the pad, pass the pad, pass the pad 
 Stop chattin shit just pass the pad, pass the pad, pass the pad 
 Hey no it's winner stays on blud pass the pad, pass the pad, pass the pad 
 Don't be a prick blud pass the pad, pass the pad, pass the pad 
 High talk and ghetto conspiracies 
 Psychotic weed dealers smokin' trees 
 Heated arguments all about the football 
 We're up all night like we're nocturnal 
 I can't be bothered to do anything but chill 
 And fuck the world outside that's how I feel 
 I've got a whole lot of time to kill 
 So fuck these bitches I'm just keepin' it real 
 (Instrumental)
