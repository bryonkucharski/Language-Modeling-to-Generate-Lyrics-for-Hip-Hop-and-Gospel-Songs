Hey turn the base up, turn the base up yeah yeah 
 Big dirty stinking base, dirty stinking base 
 Big dirty stinking base, dirty stinking base 
 Dirty, dirty stinkin big 
 Big dirty stinking base, dirty stinking base 
 Base, base, base 
 I don't need no speed 
 I don't need no heroin 
 I don't want no coke 
 You can keep your ketamine 
 I'm a bassline junkie, what? 
 I'm a bassline junkie, tell them again 
 I'm a bassline junkie, tell them again 
 I don't like it funky 
 I'm a fiend for a big day bassline 
 When I hear one I have a great time 
 A bit of bass' all what I require 
 I let the bassline take me higher 
 My friends think that it's a bad habit 
 But I'm just like fuck you, damn it 
 If you take my base away 
 I'll blow your fucking face away 
 You might think I'm over the top 
 But when I hear that bassline drop 
 I just can't control my actions 
 But I still feel satisfaction 
 So don't come around that engine 
 I just wanna hear the bassline rinsin 
 Or we can just... day 
 If not get the fuck out my way 
 I don't need no speed 
 I don't need no heroin 
 I don't want no coke 
 You can keep your ketamine 
 I'm a bassline junkie, what? 
 I'm a bassline junkie, tell them again 
 I'm a bassline junkie, tell them again 
 I don't like it funky 
 Big dirty stinking base, dirty stinking base 
 Big dirty stinking base, dirty dirty stinking base 
 Dirty, dirty stinkin big 
 Big dirty stinking base, dirty stinking base 
 Big dirty stinking base, dirty stinking base 
 Base, base, base 
 You ever doubt, go ... 
 And I think it's well out of order 
 All my neighbors throwing the fifth 
 So I told them suck my dick 
 And I told them I got the power 
 And I turn the music up louder 
 All night till 6 in the morning 
 Old bastards, they're just boring 
 You know me, I'm the bassline ... 
 Nobody can't tell me nada 
 And the police turned up and they took me 
 We drove out to the liquor and they bought me 
 When I said there give me a couchin 
 If I didn't give them no distinction 
 But I said don't bother, I'm guilty 
 I'm a bassline fucking filthy 
 I don't need no speed 
 I don't need no heroin 
 I don't want no coke 
 You can keep your ketamine 
 I'm a bassline junkie, what? 
 I'm a bassline junkie, tell them again 
 I'm a bassline junkie, tell them again 
 I don't like it funky
