(Verse 1: Dizzee Rascal) 
 I wanna get away, I wanna disappear 
 To somewhere where the sun is shining and the water's clear 
 Nobody talking bullshit in my ear 
 Just lots of cheery people drinking beer 
 On the coast and the dearest could be near 
 And lots of smiley faces, cocktails and chasers 
 Penthouses in high places 
 No problem, hate you, just wakin', I'm bakin for my delevation 
 Love makin' the penetration 
 The king of vacation that I wanna be taking 
 I just wanna see some palm trees and take shopping sprees 
 If I'm lacking what I see I'm copping or dropping Ps 
 No stopping me whilst looking for investments on properties 
 Some hotties don't wanna please 
 Some beaches with cool breezes - that's what I need 
 Strike up a conversation 
 No complication, no confrontation 
 Nobody tryna get up off they station 
 Just a lot of rehabilitation, no hesitation 
 Every day is just one big celebration 
 (Bridge: Angel) 
 You know I gotta think I'm fly girl 
 Even when I put your smiles up girl 
 We just tryna kill some time ah 
 Something kinda like fine wine 
 See you ain't gotta see my shine now girl 
 Promising to multiply it girl 
 I ain't gotta act all wild, I'm good 
 You already know my style 
 (Hook: Angel) 
 (Now everybody get your hands up high) 
 We'll have a real good time 
 Real good time 
 We're gonna feel so fine 
 (Get your hands up high) 
 Feel so alive 
 We'll have a real good time 
 Real good time 
 We're gonna feel so fine 
 If you're runnin' back to bed let me know that we can get it right 
 (Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal) 
 Fresh fruit, fresh juice, vitamin boost 
 I'm looser than a goose, I'm not a recluse 
 I'm socializing, looking over the horizon, feeling so alive 
 I'm mesmerized, I'm stopping over the ocean ready to take a dive 
 Or take five and get back, can sit back 
 I'm fresher than a Tic-Tac with nothing else to distract me 
 Exactly what the fuck to all the refs, I'm being away in the corner 
 Do I drop a form or taking a flight? 
 You with? It will be warmer 
 Now it's hotter than the sauna, 2 block of water 
 And just to keep me cool 
 I'm getting a massage in my quarters, feeling like a moola 
 All I need in comfort me, now girl what's the stop with me? 
 Then hit the time and get her back, eat or munch with me 
 When in doubt we'll keep it moving 
 Pay the bill and see a movie 
 After that we'll hit the club and keep it super groovy 
 Feelin' kinda woozy cause of the liquid we're abusing 
 Boy it's really quite amusing, plus we're vibing with the music 
 You know I gotta think I'm fly girl 
 Even when I put your smiles up girl 
 We just tryna kill some time ah 
 Something kinda like fine wine 
 See you ain't gotta see my shine now girl 
 Promising to multiply it girl 
 I ain't gotta act all wild, I'm good 
 You already know my style 
 (Now everybody get your hands up high) 
 We'll have a real good time 
 Real good time 
 We're gonna feel so fine 
 (Get your hands up high) 
 Feel so alive 
 We'll have a real good time 
 Real good time 
 We're gonna feel so fine 
 If you're runnin' back to bed let me know that we can get it right 
 If you're runnin' back to bed let me know that we can get it right 
 If you're runnin' back to bed let me know that we can get it right
