Deep -- Roll Deep through the depths of my mind... 
 Deep -- Roll Deep through the depths of my mind... 
 Deep-de-deep Roll Deep through the depths of my mind... 
 Lord knows what I'll find when I re-re-rewind 
 Deep-- Roll Deep through the depths of my mind... 
 Deep-de-deep Roll Deep through the depths of my mind... 
 'Cause I deep-- Roll Deep through the depths of my mind... 
 Lord knows what I'll find when I reach 
 'Cause I've got so much to say... in so little time... 
 In such a short space, I've got so much to do... 
 But if I can't find a way around, I'll find a way across 
 And if I can't find a way across, I'll bore straight through... 
 I find myself in a pickle... this music ain't fickle... 
 Surrounded by big dawgs and I consider them lickle... 
 As they crash the particle... the other giants... 
 I might apply some knowledge and wait for a ripple... 
 On my shoulder is a ripple 
 Some love it... some hate the idea of (no idea) 
 Squeeze a dollar from a nickel...
