Today's the greatest day of my life 
 Today they're gonna know I'm a star 
 They better know I ain't having a bar 
 I'm gonna take it to the next level foot on the pedal 
 I'm goin' for the gold medal got my hand on my heart 
 And I swear down I'm gonna go hard 
 Until I'm dearly departed, I'm so excited 
 I think it's bout time I had a little celebration and you're all invited 
 I couldn't give a damn not even the slightest 
 My swags on point and my flows the tightest 
 I'll never sell my soul god helped me write this 
 Plus I know what a fight is 
 I been through the struggle 
 In and out of trouble 
 Couple of close calls 
 But you can't hear the pain anymore in my vocals 
 It ain't even because of the pro tools 
 In total I feel so complete with life its sweet 
 You gotta scream 
 Scream it from your heart 
 Feel it from your soul 
 Scream it from your heart, if you mean it 
 Feel it from your heart 
 Scream it from your soul 
 Feel it from your heart, if you need it 
 I feel like rocky on the steps 
 I coulda drowned in the blood and the sweat 
 But instead I show the world I don't pet 
 A world wide athletic champion on deck 
 Nobody can't mess with my rep 
 Nah I'm a seasoned vet 
 And I'm the best I'm as good as it gets 
 I'm the champion now 
 So I don't care who they call next 
 I've earned my respect 
 Now they're loving the way I flex 
 Run up in the offices they're writing a major check 
 So it doesn't matter about the butterflies in my solar plex 
 Never the nervous wreck, cool and calm 
 Keep sharp and focused and stay out of harm 
 Plus I can't be rocked 
 You know I'm far too hot to be given the drop 
 Stay better then I'm never gonna give up the top spot 
 I'm keeping the spot locked 
 I'm throwing the keys now everybody sing with me, scream 
 Scream it from your heart 
 Feel it from your soul 
 Scream it from your heart 
 If you mean it (scream) 
 Feel it from your heart 
 Scream it from your soul 
 Feel it from your heart 
 If you need it, ha ha ah, ha ha ah 
 Boy it's lonely at the top 
 But it's overcrowded at the bottom 
 And where I come from's overly rotten 
 I'm from the east side I ain't forgotten 
 But it's bigger than that 
 World wide peoples livin' is wack 
 It's bigger than grime and bigger than rap 
 People living in crap 
 No fresh water out of the tap 
 Plus they're being attacked what kinda living is that 
 Look anywhere in the map 
 Too many young boys stuck in the trap 
 Too many young boys running round strapped, ready to clap 
 Too many young girls fall in the gap 
 They're fallin' for chat from dumb cats that need to fall back 
 Think about life cause there ain't no re run 
 No DVD no second season 
 When you're the future flame maybe you could be one 
 Till then let chorus be sung, scream
