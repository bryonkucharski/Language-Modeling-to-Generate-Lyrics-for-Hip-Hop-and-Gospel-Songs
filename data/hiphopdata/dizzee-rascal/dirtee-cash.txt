Money talks, listen, money talks, get money 
 Dirty cash, I want you, dirty cash, I need you, whoa 
 Money talks, it don't stop, money talks, it don't stop 
 Dirty cash, I want you, dirty cash, I need you, whoa 
 Let's go 
 Everybody wants to be famous 
 Nobody wants to be nameless, aimless 
 People act shameless, tryna live like entertainers 
 Want a fat crib with the acres 
 So they spend money that they ain't made yet 
 Got a Benz on tick that they ain't paid yet 
 Spend their paycheck in the West End on the weekend 
 Got no money by the end of the weekend 
 But they don't care 'cause their life is a movie 
 Starring Louis V, paid for by yours truly 
 Truthfully, it's a joke like a bad episode of Hollyoaks 
 Can't keep up with the cover lows 
 So they got bad credit livin' on direct 
 Livin' in debt but they still don't get it 
 'Cause they too busy livin' the high life, the night life 
 Fuckin' the high way, livin' large and they all say 
 Money talks, money talks, you got no 
 Dirty cash, I want you, dirty cash, I need you, whoa 
 Money talks, money talks, for real, though 
 Dirty cash, I want you, dirty cash, I need you, whoa 
 Let me take you down to London city 
 Where the attitude's bad and the weather is shitty 
 Everybody's on the paper chase, it's one big rat race 
 Everybody's got a screw face, so many two face 
 Checkin' their hide, they set their record to ride 
 I'm on the inside, looking at the outside 
 So it's an accurate reflection citywide 
 All things west and the Southside 
 Everywhere I go, there's a girl on the corner 
 Buns undressed got the city like sauna 
 And it's getting warmer, a lot of water 
 Turn a poor, struggling mother to a mourner 
 Mister politician, can you tell me the solution? 
 What's the answer, what's the conclusion? 
 Is it an illusion, is it a mirage? 
 I see them all go bad because they're tryna live large 
 And they all say, all say 
 I've no excuse, I just want you to use me 
 Take me and abuse me 
 I got no taboos, I'll make a trade with you 
 Do anything you want me to 
 Money talks, money talks, listen 
 Dirty cash, I want you, dirty cash, I need you, whoa 
 Money talks, yeah, yeah, money talks, it don't stop 
 Dirty cash, I want you, dirty cash, I need you, whoa 
 Yo, we're living in the days of the credit crunch 
 Give me the dough, I'm trying to have a bunch 
 But I can't have raps for lunch 
 It's nothing, enough to share, it ain't fair 
 I never dreamed that it could be rare 
 Who cares who's there to make a change? 
 Everyone's in the club tryna to make it rain 
 But not for fun here, just for the sake of habit 
 Fifteen minutes of fame and everywhere's the same 
 Again and again, I see the same thing 
 Everybody acting like they're playin' Zenden 
 But I see rough seas ahead, maybe a recession 
 And then the depression, then whatever profession 
 This is my confession, I can't fuck, I'm in the forefront 
 Livin' for my new record to start like a bungee jump 
 With no rope, but I ain't tryna see the bottom 
 Because that is where I came from, I ain't forgotten 
 Money talks, money talks, sing it to her 
 Dirty cash, I want you, dirty cash, I need you, whoa 
 Money talks, yeah, yeah, money talks, for real 
 Dirty cash, I want you, dirty cash, I need you, whoa
