(Verse 1: Dizzee) 
 Some people sayin' it's the end of days 
 We're on the brink of Armageddon, only thing that we can do is pray 
 If that's the case then fuck it anyway 
 If I ain't promised tomorrow I'm gonna live for today 
 No point in stressin or riskin a dream up over only for a rumour 
 Cause sooner or later everybody's gonna meet their maker 
 Till then you'll find me in the Cayman Islands or Jamaica 
 Drinkin' run with a chaser, laughin' because the groove is greater 
 I'm getting wasted on a boat but I ain't seasick 
 I'm busy tryna convince this girl to let me see her bits 
 I'm tryna convince her even more that she should see mine 
 You think I'm being a sexist, this is just I politic 
 I know some people find it hard to swallow it 
 But I just catch a vibe and then I follow it 
 Don't mean that I'm a hollow prick 
 I just ain't thick enough to think that I can live forever 
 So until my last endeavour I'd die for whatever, whatever 
 No matter what you say 
 No matter what you say 
 Life keeps moving on 
 No matter what you do 
 Just do what you're doing 
 Life keeps moving on 
 (Because) Life keeps moving on 
 (Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal) 
 Some people spend their whole lives tryna please the world 
 Some men go crazy or go broke tryna please a girl 
 Some women give away their booties for diamonds or pearls 
 I just kick back, I take a look and I say oh well 
 'Cause it's my skin off my nose, I just want money or clothes 
 I'm happy, no lucky hoes, I'm layin stacks on my toes 
 Ain't got no time for enemies and I don't care about foes 
 Everyone knows and it shows that I'm bringin' them O's 
 That means I'm fuckin' the midgets, that means I'm countin' them figures 
 Over the night I consider myself an everyday jigga but bugger 
 My car's cold, it will make you shiver 
 I know, go crazy bitch, turn the music up, I'll make you quiver 
 Speeding through the city, it's a part bass bangin' 
 Trip tonic, thinkin' supersonic 
 Leave all right that's how you getting fly 
 Sayin' ah fuck it 'cause it's only caution 
 If I die tomorrow you straight up having a blast 
 No matter what you say 
 No matter what you say 
 Life keeps moving on 
 No matter what you do 
 Just do what you're doing 
 Life keeps moving on 
 (Because) Life keeps moving on 
 (Verse 3: Dizzee Rascal) 
 Forget that nostalgia shit 'cause I ain't got time 
 Don't care what happened yesterday, today is damn fine 
 There's no blast from the past that can top what I got 
 Till this present day I still shine 
 So when they told me recline I kindly declined 
 Whatever's in front of me positively behind 
 I will never rewind, meaning I would never ever be grind 
 Just to say you cry, now I look forward to 2 times 
 I love a bit of free time with a weeb done 
 She might be Scottish, either way she's hottish 
 I know that ain't even a word, maybe I've lost the plottish 
 Maybe I'm crazy or maybe it's just another one 
 Living between the wars, revolutions and the earthquakes 
 The recessions, pollutions and political face 
 All I need is my mace, my mama couple sunny breaks 
 And if the world ends tomorrow I'm straight 
 No matter what you say 
 No matter what you say 
 Life keeps moving on 
 No matter what you do 
 Just do what you're doing 
 Life keeps moving on 
 (Because) Life keeps moving on 
 Yeah one time one time one time 
 Life keeps moving on
