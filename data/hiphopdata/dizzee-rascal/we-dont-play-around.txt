(Hook: Jessie J) 
 Make no mistakes 
 When we go, we go hard 
 We don't play around no oh 
 We don't play around no oh 
 5am screaming louder than rock stars 
 We don't play around no oh 
 We don't play around no oh 
 (Verse 1: Dizzee Rascal) 
 I don't wanna tell you how to have a good time 
 I wanna show you how a good time looks like 
 Tell whoever's in your house don't wait up 
 We're gonna party and we're gonna do it all night 
 I got something in my pocket that'll blow your mind 
 I got something in a glass that'll free you up 
 So why you're standing there looking all stupid? 
 I'll bet you any money I could get you pop flop 
 I never wanna hear no half why excuses 
 All I wanna do is stand up to the music 
 Everybody's getting loose and this an exclusive 
 All the women over there they're looking intrusive 
 Pull your socks up a little, opposite of useless 
 Go and offer them a glass and a couple juices 
 Haters say they wanna roll y'all we can do this 
 If you wanna have a good time then approve it 
 (Hook: Jessie J) 
 (Hook 2: Jessie J) 
 We gon drink, hands high 
 When we in the club tonight 
 Hands up that's right 
 When we in the club tonight 
 Make no mistakes 
 When we go, we go hard 
 We don't play around no oh 
 We don't play around no oh 
 (Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal) 
 Big fish, little fish, cardboard box 
 Now you're getting all hot, drop don't stop 
 Have you feeling like you're gonna pass her all up 
 Did you ever think that you could ever get this hot? 
 Everybody looking at you and they're all in shock 
 'Cause you're getting jiggy with it all over the shot 
 But you never thought that I could make you drop on lock 
 But you never thought that I could make you want ambra 
 Skippy on the beat, shuffling your feet 
 I know you feel sweet 
 But you don't wanna hump it 
 You don't wanna clash, you're gonna damn rush 
 I'll pull up them MJ blues in a flash 
 And I'm fightin off a birthday rush 
 How you know I'm looking for the birthday lash? 
 Gonna get high on my birthday stash 
 I just wanna have a good time but guess what? 
 (Hook: Jessie J) 
 Make no mistakes 
 When we go, we go hard 
 We don't play around no oh 
 We don't play around no oh 
 5am screaming louder than rock stars 
 We don't play around no oh 
 We don't play around no oh 
 We gon drink, hands high 
 When we in the club tonight 
 Hands up that's right 
 When we in the club tonight 
 Make no mistakes 
 When we go, we go hard 
 We don't play around no oh 
 We don't play around no oh 
 (Bridge: Dizzee Rascal (Jessie J)) 
 I don't wanna tell you how to have a good time 
 I wanna show you how a good time looks like 
 (We go hard) 
 I don't wanna tell you how to have a good time 
 I wanna show you how a good time looks like 
 (We don't play around) 
 (Hook 2: Jessie J) 
 We don't play around no oh 
 We don't play around no oh 
 We don't play around no oh 
 We don't play around no oh
