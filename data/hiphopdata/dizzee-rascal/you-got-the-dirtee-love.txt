Everybody wants to be famous, 
 Nobody wants to be nameless, aimless, 
 People act shameless 
 Tryna live like entertainers, 
 Want a fat crib with the acres, 
 So they spend money that they ain't made yet, 
 Got a Benz on tick that they ain't paid yet, 
 Spend their paycheck 
 In the west out on a weekend 
 Got no money by the end of the weekend. 
 But they don't care cause their life is a movie, 
 Starring Louis V, paid for by yours truly, 
 Truthfully, it's a joke, like a bad episode of hollyoaks, 
 Can't keep up with the cover notes, 
 So they got bad credit livin' on direct debit in debt 
 They still don't get it 
 'Cause they too busy livin' the high life, the night life 
 Huggin' the high when livin' it large 
 And they all say 
 Sometimes it seems that the going is just too rough 
 And things go wrong no matter what I do 
 (That's right) 
 Now and then it seems like life is just too much 
 But you've got the love I need to see me through 
 Let me take you down to London city 
 Where the attitude's bad and the weather is shitty 
 Everybody's on a paper chase 
 It's one big rat race 
 Everybody's got a screw face 
 So many two-faced, 
 Checkin' their high sayin' they're ready to ride 
 I'm on the inside looking at the 
 So it's an accurate reflection 
 City wide, north, east, west and the southside 
 Everywhere I go there's a goon on the corner 
 Guns and drugs cause the city's like a sauna 
 And it's getting warmer, and out of order 
 Tryna put a struggling mother to a mourner 
 Mr. Politician can you tell me the solution 
 What's the answer, what's the conclusion 
 Is it an illusion, is it a mirage 
 I see youngsters die because they tryna live large 
 And they all say 
 Sometimes I feel like throwing my hands up in the air 
 I know I can count on all of you 
 Sometimes I feel like saying "Lord, I just don't care" 
 (That's right, that's right) 
 But you've got the love I need to see me through 
 (Check it, check it, come on, come on) 
 You got the love 
 (Who's got the love) 
 You got the love 
 (Who's got the love) 
 You got the love 
 (That's right, that's right, that's right) 
 You got the love 
 (Who's got the love) 
 You got the love 
 (Who's got the love) 
 You got the love 
 (Check it) 
 We are living in the days of the credit crunch 
 Give me the dough 
 I'm tryna have a bunch 
 But I can't have rice for lunch 
 It's not there ain't enough to share 
 It ain't fair never dreamed that he could be rare 
 Who cares who dares to make a change 
 Everybody's in the club trying to make it rain 
 But not for famine just for the sake of having 
 15 minutes of fame and everywhere's the same 
 Again and again I see the same thing 
 Everybody acting like they play sailin' 
 But I see rough seas ahead maybe a recession 
 And then a depression in whatever profession 
 This is my confession I can't front I'm in the forefront 
 Living for money ready to start like a bungee jump 
 With no rope but I ain't trying to see the bottom 
 Because that's where I came from, I ain't forgotten, 
 You got the love 
 (Who's got the love) 
 You got the love 
 You got the love 
 (Who's got the love) 
 You got the love 
 You got the love 
 (That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right) 
 You got the love 
 You got the love 
 You got the love 
 (Who's got the love, who's got the love, who's got the love) 
 Sometimes I feel like throwing my hands up in the air 
 I know I can count on all of you 
 Sometimes I feel like saying "Lord, I just don't care" 
 But you've got the love I need to see me through
