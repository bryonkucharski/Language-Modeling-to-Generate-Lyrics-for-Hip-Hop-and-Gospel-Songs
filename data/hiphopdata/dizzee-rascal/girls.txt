Yo I dunno, Marga Man, wit tha rasket, Dizzee Rascal 
 Walking through the club doors, make way, make space 
 Make some more yo 'n' gettin' all the girls 
 Think der set, they don't know, they stink of sweat 
 It's Marga Man, Dizzee Rascal 
 As I get past the bouncers, walk to the dancefloor, 
 Onto the stage, am blastin', 
 I've been blessed tonight on the sight 
 With all these beautiful beenies dancing 
 Am normally placed in front of a crowd 
 Who push up their face and stare and just stand, 
 But thank god tonight, it's a totally different affair 
 I'm so excited and delighted, 
 Almost feel to take ma hat off to these beenies 
 Who excite me by the way they shake their back off 
 It's amazing the way you lower urself and rise again, 
 It's amazing, I feel the type to pick up the mike and rise again 
 Yo we got girls in the north, girls in the south, 
 Girls in the east, girls in the west 
 Yo big batties, big breasts, 
 So much gash no time to rest 
 Straight to the ting, no time to caress,
