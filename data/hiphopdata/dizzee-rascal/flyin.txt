Yeah, oi 
 What up man, what are ya this week? 
 He thinks he's rough, and he's always got a screw-face 
 He's stush and he thinks he's heavy 
 I've heard, I've heard it all man 
 That's the same thing, that's the same shit 
 I can't believe it 
 I'm just being me 
 I work... I'm not doing 'cause I got the money or 'cause I'm famous 
 This is what I was, you get me? (You know my face, I've been everywhere I swear to you) 
 You can say I'm too rude, you can say I think I'm heavy 
 You can say I think I'm all that, I've heard it all already 
 You can say I think I'm rough, you can say you can't wait 
 Till the day you meet me face to face and swear to set me straight 
 You can say I sound whack, you can say I'm overrated 
 You can slag me off to every female I've ever dated 
 You can say I'm kinda meek, you can say I'm just a prick 
 Just say you what you want and what you will but say it quick 
 'Cause I'm flyin, I ain't got time 
 You must be makin' moves, why you watchin' mine? 
 You got so much to say about my grime 
 You must be up there, I see you up there 
 'Cause I'm flyin, I ain't got time 
 You must be makin' moves, why you watchin' mine? 
 You got so much to say about my grime 
 You must be up there, I see you up there, yeah? 
 You can I'm arrogant, you should probably say I'm vain 
 You can say my head swole since I see a little fame 
 You can say I left the hood, my success was a mistake 
 You can say I'm under pressure, you can say I'm bound to break 
 You can never say I'm fake, 'cause I always keep it real 
 You can say "so wot?" I can say "so chill" 
 You can say I'm too cheeky, you can say I make you sick 
 Just say what you want and what you will but say it quick 
 'Cause I'm flyin, I ain't got time 
 You must be makin' moves, why you watchin' mine? 
 You got so much to say about my grime 
 You must be up there, I see you up there 
 'Cause I'm flyin, I ain't got time 
 You must be makin' moves, why you watchin' mine? 
 You got so much to say about my grime 
 You must be up there, I see you up there, yeah? 
 Fellas acting bitchy lately quite unsurprisingly 
 They would love to cut my face but they just cock their eyes at me 
 Like little ladies would you wish you could express yourself with violence 
 Silence is your best option, best keep your feelings stealth 
 And they're wondering if I'm gonna laugh, I'm saying don't worry 
 I weren't invited here, I ain't leavin' in a hurry 
 So any preconceptions that you've got of me, forget them 
 Please don't let 'em, confuse you -- I'm gully 
 And rude, and blatant, no time, in a hurry, impatient 
 Don't make no more inquiries, fuck you is my only statement 
 The only answer I'm about to give you: 
 Fuck you and whoever came with you 
 Fuck them and anybody related, fuck about, get me frustrated 
 'Cause I ain't the type to hype and rare 
 Hope I scare em, make 'em fear me 
 I'm pretty certain you're not near me 
 There's no need for that 
 I'm taking time, away from the pen and pad and grime serious grime 
 Leave the microphone alone, strap and spray some verses with the 9 
 'Cause I'm flyin, I ain't got time 
 You must be makin' moves, why you watchin' mine? 
 You got so much to say about my grime 
 You must be up there, I see you up there 
 'Cause I'm flyin, I ain't got time 
 You must be makin' moves, why you watchin' mine? 
 You got so much to say about my grime 
 You must be up there, I see you up there, yeah? 
 Rascit... won't change for no one, ever 
 I'm me, I've been me 
 Dapper, rapper, jacker, whateva' 
 I don't play, swear to you
