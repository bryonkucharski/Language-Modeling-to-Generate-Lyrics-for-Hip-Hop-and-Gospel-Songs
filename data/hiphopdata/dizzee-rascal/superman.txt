I am Superman, bitch I'm Superman 
 I am Superman, Superman Superman 
 I am Superman, bitch I'm Superman 
 I am Superman, Superman Superman 
 I turn a dollar to 100, to 100 million 
 Leap over tall buildings, niggas can't get em 
 I turn a dollar to 100, to 100 million 
 Leap over tall buildings, niggas can't get em 
 I am Superman, bitch I'm Superman 
 (Verse 1: Dizzee Rascal) 
 Yo! I'm young, free, I'm running amok 
 And I just got paid so I'm really gonna live it up 
 I'm on that Superman flex 
 Tryna think about which part [?] holiday next 
 A lot of chilling and a whole lot of sex 
 I need a girl to keep my thingy erect 
 And I ain't silly 'cause I always keep my Jimmy protected 
 So I don't ever worry bout getting infected 
 My only concern is that vibe stays jiggy 
 So you ain't gotta worry bout spending no money if you're ridin' with me 
 I'll put it all on the card, [?] paper 
 And think about what it cost me later 
 I think that we should start in Jamaica 
 Or maybe Antigua, I know a couple spots in Ibiza 
 Everybody's watchin me 'cause I'm a over achiever 
 And I could really do with a breather 
 Girl give me one 
 Girl you be like how, how you do it? 
 How you do it? 
 Oh how you do it? 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 Oh how you do it? 
 How I do it? 
 How, how I do it? 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 (Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal) 
 My own deal winner says count your blessings 
 From the car that you drive to the clothes you dress in 
 So I'm D&G head-to-toe 
 I got a little swagger and I'm letting it show 
 Plus I got money to blow, that's why I'm letting you know 
 All you really need is just the bare necessities 
 So pack 'em and I'm ready to go 
 So what you're waitin for? I'm ready to roll 
 And I can tell that you're excited, you ain't telling me no 
 I've got a friend with a boat so you we can float in the Caribbean Sea 
 Or we could drive by the coast, top down, catching the breeze 
 And now I wanna speed, I'm takin' it easy 
 I want you to enjoy the scenery 
 We ain't in a hurry, don't need to rush and scurry 
 Don't even worry yourself, you look lovely 
 Enjoy the sun, you think this is fun 
 No we ain't never started, we ain't never broke up, come on 
 Girl you be like how, how you do it? 
 How you do it? 
 Oh how you do it? 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 Oh how you do it? 
 How I do it? 
 How, how I do it? 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 All my bitches high, all my bitches fly 
 All these bottles, getting drunk up in here tonight 
 Even my money high, talking sky high 
 You want some, space god 
 She was just walkin' by her own 
 She thinks that she's a model 
 She want it all, it's not all 
 Won't there be no more bottles? 
 Girl you be like how, how you do it? 
 How you do it? 
 Oh how you do it? 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 Oh how you do it? 
 How I do it? 
 How, how I do it? 
 Oh oh oh oh
