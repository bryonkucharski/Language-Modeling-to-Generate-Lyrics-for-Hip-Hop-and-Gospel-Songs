(Music: CAGE) 
 (Lyrics: Sean Peck) 
 Oh when it came they thought the safeguards remained oh no! 
 They knew that others had told them so 
 Anarchy in the streets begins to grow 
 The blackness made all our morals melt 
 Survival instinct is a that is felt 
 Protect your home and you family 
 Because GOD has set the monster free 
 Stand and fight 
 Organize rebellion 
 We'll uprise and soon you know that the peace will decay 
 The trigger effect has wiped the laws away 
 Will you still obey? 
 The trigger effect is beginning today 
 As frustration filled the streets 
 The politicians stomped their feet 
 They roled the tanks into the towns to beat our opposition down 
 Stand and fight 
 Join us in rebelion 
 We'll uprise if they break their oath to us peace will decay 
 The trigger effect has wiped the laws away 
 Will you still obey? 
 The trigger effect is beginning today 
 We are in disarray 
 Pandora's open mankind will pay 
 Something is not right 
 The feeling is all wrong 
 We are not giving in the people are strong 
 We are going the distance we will forge a new way 
 A primal existence is what we all crave 
 Power has been restored 
 It's too late the chaos grows exponentially 
 Was it self fulfilling prophecy 
 Is this the end of our democracy 
 Empires fall structure is purged 
 Revolution removes the scourge 
 It happens every few centuries 
 It is time we bring them to their knees! 
 Stand and fight 
 Fight with our rebelion 
 We'll uprise 
 With a gun in hand oh the peace will decay 
 The trigger effect has wiped the laws away 
 Will you still obey? 
 The trigger effect is beginning today 
 We are in disarray 
 Pandora's open mankind will pay 
 To kill is the way 
 Surviving the bloodshed there's lives you must take 
 It's pointing at you 
 Make no mistake what wil you do?
