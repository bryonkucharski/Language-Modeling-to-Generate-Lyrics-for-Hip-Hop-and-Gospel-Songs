I'm the reaper the sealer of fate 
 Make your peace before it's too late 
 In this prison they call Newgate 
 I am the hand of doom 
 Shed no tear I'm blind to it all 
 Surrounded by death 
 But still l stand tall 
 Haunted by horrors 
 Behind these great walls 
 One day you'll meet me too 
 Behind the walls 
 Pick a prisoner to be sacrifices 
 Dead man walking makes it all right 
 Tell myself it's to save my wife 
 I'll do what I must do 
 Allistar gave me a pill 
 I made him (Jarvis Felton) choke on it till he lie still 
 I must admit it gave me a thrill to whom I did it to 
 Behind the walls - the horrors they hide there is no escape 
 Behind the walls of Newgate 
 Behind the walls - a noose on your neck a victim of fate 
 Behind the walls of Newgate 
 Jarvis Felton the worst of the worst 
 It was my pleasure to make him go first 
 I fashioned my carriage into a hearse 
 It would be his tomb 
 Little lies to get past the guards 
 Wheeling his body crossing the yard 
 Keeping them silent would not be hard 
 They were all my crew 
 Allistar was glad I arrived 
 Let's check the body make sure he survived 
 Jarvis Felton was still alive slowly coming to 
 Take his body bring him inside 
 And this must be your lovely bride 
 Brace yourself you're in for a ride 
 For what we're about to do
