(Music: Dave Garcia) 
 (Lyrics: Sean Peck) 
 You try and invade my life, 
 You think you're my fucking wife 
 My back is holding your knife, 
 I have a few things to say 
 Yours ain't the only way, 
 Your bitching has got me crazy 
 How many time do you, 
 Yell at me till I'm blue 
 I'm telling you now we're through 
 You get on my nerves you grate, 
 You're sorry but it's too late 
 You're leaving and I can't wait 
 You bother me you're going away 
 You bother me you're leaving today 
 I can see through you you are driving me 
 To the bitter end why can't you see 
 You sit there and wonder 
 Because you never listen 
 Here's something to ponder 
 Stop your fucking bitching at me 
 You're shit is out of my place 
 I'm sick of you makeup face 
 Get out and don't leave a trace 
 We had a few nights of fun 
 Check that and make it one 
 Your leaving and watch me run 
 You are not the same 
 Free me from your pain 
 Reputation stain never more again
