When Confederate forces took the Norfolk Naval Yard, they found the remains of the USS Merrimack. They raised her and converted her into a Casemate Ironclad Ram and armed her with 10 guns. Renamed the CSS Virginia, her first military action sank the Union ships Congress and Cumberland, making the Union fleet obsolete overnight. In response to this new ominous threat, the Union built a bigger monster of their own - the Monitor! 
 The Metal Tyrant of the sea 
 We'll bring the South down to its knees 
 All engines full for ramming speed 
 Nine plates of iron and blackened steel 
 From the mind of John Ericsson in 1861 
 118 days it took to fit her with her guns 
 To answer the Confederates a fit courageous crew 
 They launched her to serve Liberty in 1862 
 The Monitor, the Iron Scourge 
 The Metal Tyrant of the sea 
 The Monitor, a slaughterer 
 Will bring the South down to its knees 
 The Monitor, the forefather 
 Of naval combat for the free 
 The Monitor, a murderer 
 Engines full for ramming speed! 
 As she steamed ahead, they set sail for hell 
 Sinking deep down to the depths, dead sailors never tell 
 In the battle of Hampton Roads the Merrimack would fight 
 Only one dared challenge her, they'd battle on this night 
 Four hours cannons lighting up the skyline 
 Neither ship could turn the battle tide 
 A hit from their cannons and the captain became blind 
 First Officer Greene took the helm and refused to run and hide 
 The seas were rough while undertow the waves were crashing high 
 On New Year's Eve right off the coast some 16 men would die 
 She holds today a legacy her history enshrined 
 The fiercest of the ironclads, a legend of her time 
 The Monitor, the Iron Scourge 
 The Metal Tyrant of the sea 
 The Monitor, a slaughterer 
 Will bring the South down to its knees 
 The Monitor, the forefather 
 Of naval combat for the free 
 The Monitor, a mariner 
 Engines full for ramming speed! 
 The Metal Tyrant of the sea 
 We'll bring the South down to its knees 
 All engines full for ramming speed 
 Nine plates of iron and blackened steel 
 The Monitor!
