She needs more not built to last lying on the floor 
 She needs it fast that wizard said go get a girl 
 There's only one girl in the world 
 Who's body that none can resist 
 Perfectly poisonous lips seductively thrusting her hips 
 Beating you with chains and whips 
 Cassandra, some men gave their lives up for you 
 Cassandra, there's just one more thing you must do 
 I went to her cell late at night, a raven beauty what a sight 
 Oh how her eyes they did seduce 
 But I slipped a pill into her juice 
 As she sat there on the bed, she pulled me close to her head 
 As I succumbed to her charms, she fell asleep in my arms 
 You're a beautiful dream that came true 
 Now settle down my dear and enjoy the ride 
 I snuck her body out in a cart 
 I took her over to Allistar, my angel wife said get the witch 
 Now strap her down and throw the switch 
 Cassandra pleaded and wailed then verbally was assailed 
 Shut up bitch was the yell coming from Annabelle 
 Grinding stones sounds from the floor 
 It had begun she needed more 
 Pretty Cassandra began to scream 
 From her mouth came smoke and steam 
 I watched it all in the glow 
 Heard something strange from below 
 Cassandra arched up her back 
 I saw something slimy and black 
 You're a beautiful dream that came true 
 Now settle down my dear and enjoy the ride 
 Oh my poor dear Cassandra
