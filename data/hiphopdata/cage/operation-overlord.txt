Rushing to the shore 
 Splashing metal gates 
 Oh the time has come 
 For the bravest of the brave 
 Overwhelming force 
 By the thousands we invade 
 We must prevail and win the longest day 
 To win the fight 
 The nations on this day unite 
 By land and sea the air we breathe 
 We charge on blindly to the fire 
 Rise up and face the terror of tyranny 
 Break out fury will seal their fate 
 A state of total war 
 The world wont be the same 
 The bodies and the bullets fall like rain 
 Charging to the wall 
 The sand is bloody stained 
 Our soldiers die 
 But our courage still remains 
 It's up to us again 
 Before all is lost 
 Two hundred thousand men 
 Will defeat and crush the iron cross 
 Shattered bone and blood 
 Battleships and planes 
 The tyrant's fall 
 We've broken them again 
 The pounding heavy guns 
 We're fearless yet afraid 
 A heavy price our dead have surely paid 
 God bless them all and glory to the brave!
