(Music: Dave Garcia) 
 (Lyrics: Sean Peck) 
 Well right now you found out what life's about 
 Your friends they might die and you will know why 
 Right now the time is arising for you to go into hiding 
 Beware of the path you take 
 Don't you run and break 
 They said be all you can be so you joined the army 
 With no direction you chose the big gun 
 In two years time you would be in and out you would see 
 The world and you'd raise the funds to get grades 
 All of a sudden there came a war 
 Beware of the path you take 
 Don't you run and break 
 We sent troops but needed more Middle Eastern crazy man 
 You shipped off to a foreign land 
 You never expected to really fight 
 Everything changes overnight 
 Your mind is one big death program 
 Shoot and kill the foreign man 
 This conflict you deal with the things you feel 
 Like killing you fellow man or the death of your commrade 
 Don't forget to save your own skin 
 This fight you must win if you don't you will die 
 The Tears in your eyes
