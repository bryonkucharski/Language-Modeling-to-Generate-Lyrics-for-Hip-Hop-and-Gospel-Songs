It's over, the end times have now come and gone 
 Smoldering cities still burning in the distance - The breaking of dawn 
 Crawling from wreckage, survivors uniting - We rise with glory and steel 
 Inside us we're changing, evolving and knowing - A new golden age is here 
 The fighting is over, the battle is won, the holy war left us in ruin up 
 From the ashes our new world's begun - A spiritual revolution 
 We hear the devil say then we turned around and walked the other way 
 He whispers to your soul 
 Broken bones, blood on ice, I'm your human sacrifice 
 Lose your mind, no control, we just want to rock and roll 
 The lords of the dark are gone forever and all 
 We stand in victory 
 Rise up and be counted for those that come tonight 
 Thy kingdom come, thy will be done all right 
 We're taking you far beyond the apocalypse (far beyond) 
 Taking you far beyond the end of the world (far beyond) 
 We're taking you far beyond the apocalypse (far beyond) 
 Taking you far beyond the end of the world 
 Spiraling upwards and touching the sky, new cities of shimmering silver 
 Into the future our power will fly, creation has been changed forever 
 We hear the devil say then we turned around and walked the other way 
 He whispers to your soul 
 Broken bones, blood on ice, I'm your human sacrifice 
 Lose your mind, no control, we just want to rock and roll 
 Utopian nights, cities with luminous lights 
 Turning the darkness into eternal daylight 
 What is happening to me? 
 I feel strange 
 Rise up and be counted for those that come tonight 
 Thy kingdom come, thy will be done all right 
 We're taking you far beyond the apocalypse (far beyond) 
 Taking you far beyond the end of the world (far beyond) 
 We're taking you far beyond the apocalypse (far beyond) 
 Taking you far beyond the end of the world 
 Where do we go from here now (the end of the world) 
 That there is nothing more to fear (the end of the world) 
 Where do we go from here now (the end of the world) 
 That there is nothing more to fear (the end of the world)
