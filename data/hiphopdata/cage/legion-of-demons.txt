Up from his kingdom of fire his legions come swarming 
 Unholy warriors cry, a dark day is dawning 
 Crushing the snow and the ice, they stand by the millions 
 Dealing with the devil's device, they'll bring his dominion 
 They come without warning, the ending is near 
 They blacken the light of the sun 
 They fall from the sky making men disappear 
 Blasting their hellfire guns 
 Send forth the legion - Breaking the seal 
 Legion - Lightning and steel 
 Legion... 
 Legion of demons 
 The legions of demons 
 Now go - Up from below - Nothing shall stop you 
 Wicked savior - Savior of the wicked 
 Laser eyes, locusts they fly they'll burn every nation 
 No one will be left alive - The first revelation 
 They come without warning, the ending is near 
 They blacken the light of the sun 
 They fall from the sky making men disappear 
 Blasting their hellfire guns 
 Send forth the legion - Breaking the seal 
 Legion - Lightning and steel 
 Legion... 
 Legion of demons 
 The legions of demons 
 Divide - Take none alive - Show them no mercy 
 Wicked savior - Savior of the wicked 
 Prepare for revelation, destroy and divide 
 Take all the unbelievers and bathe them in hellfire 
 This sinful world of man is mine to conquer and slay 
 With my evil revolution the light will die today 
 Take them, make them all mine! 
 Evil revolution 
 Satan's retribution 
 Demonic invasion 
 Total devastation 
 Mankind's armies falling 
 Revelation calling 
 Legions of demons are taking your souls! 
 Two billions lives have been lost, the legions devour 
 Nothing can stop their attack, it's man's final hour 
 They come without warning, the ending is near 
 They blacken the light of the sun 
 They fall from the sky making men disappear 
 Blasting their hellfire guns 
 Send forth the legion - Breaking the seal 
 Legion - Lightning and steel 
 Legion... 
 Legion of demons 
 The legions of demons 
 Yes - My power protects you - Their weapons are useless 
 Wicked savior - Savior of the wicked 
 Deadly recreation 
 Evil coronation 
 Hopeless situation
