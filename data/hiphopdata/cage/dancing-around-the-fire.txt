(Music: Eric Horton) 
 (Lyrics: Sean Peck) 
 The change of an age we're turning the page 
 We're racing towards a turbulent time 
 Intensity grows as conflict explodes 
 But they've got something in mind 
 The ending is near there's so much to fear 
 But look at people standing in line 
 They've gathered in droves some removing clothes 
 The quickening time 
 Re-creation of manking devastation 
 They're dancing around the fire 
 They're watching the flames get higher 
 The prophecies tell and some say they sell 
 But all encompass one common line 
 One huge event that's so prominent It boggles the mind 
 The people don't scare they're so well prepared 
 They're gleaming with a confident smile 
 They eagerly wait they anticipate a short while 
 Re-creation of manking, incantations while 
 They're dancing around the fire 
 They're watching the flames get higher 
 They're dancing around the fire 
 They're dancing around the fire 
 I'm feeling what I see 
 The fire is calling me 
 Re-creation of mankind alien nation 
 They're dancing around the fire 
 They're watching the flames get higher 
 They're dancing around the fire 
 Oh God we're dancing around the fire
