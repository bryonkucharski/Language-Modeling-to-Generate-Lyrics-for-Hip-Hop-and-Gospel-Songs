They made him and now they're his slaves and soon all creation will follow 
 Chosen to rise, irresistible lies 
 He is the king of tomorrow 
 Accepting his path and coming of age, abusing political might 
 Black magic rays for the end of days 
 The instrument of revelation 
 He mystifies seductive eyes 
 He's come to set the world on fire 
 Abomination - Draining the life from us all 
 Abomination - Into the fire 
 Tyrannically taming the earth, the nations are heeding his call 
 He promises peace - the lies of the beast 
 One by one the nations fall 
 In line the seventh sign will seal a new order 
 Abomination - Draining the life from us all 
 Abomination - Into the fire 
 Abomination - The voice of an angel will call 
 Abomination 
 The circle of light preparing to strike 
 The circle of light preparing to strike 
 Sovereign minds all unite and save the world 
 All are blind by his eyes from desire 
 I give you all this gift unto the world 
 Peace forever if you follow me 
 The devil is pleased with his plan, his minions rejoice in his name 
 Some cry out loud but few hear the sound 
 The sound of the reckoning 
 He's gathered the leaders tonight, the nations unite now as one 
 They follow in prayer his hypnotic stare 
 The new age of hell has begun 
 All rise as freedom dies 
 Hail the new age messiah 
 Abomination - Draining the life from us all 
 Abomination - Into the fire 
 Abomination - The voice of an angel will call 
 Abomination 
 The circle of light preparing to strike 
 One last hope for forever
