We set out to the sea dragging the sarcophagus 
 That held within the beast, across the desert dunes 
 We finally came upon a ship to carry us away to England 
 Turn this ship into the wind and lay the gauntlet down 
 Thundering the vicious waves attack the wooden hull 
 This trek will take us where the master has commanded 
 Where he will usher in a horrible hideous new age 
 The fury of the wind drives us fast across this sea of madness 
 Will it ever end this nightmare just goes on and on 
 This insanity breaking like the raging sea of madness 
 All humanity if this ship survives all will be lost 
 Something drives this vessel pushing past the point of no return 
 We feel the violence of the ocean ripping us apart 
 Supernatural the way we move and navigate 
 The very laws of nature bending to my master's will 
 Across the sea of madness 
 We told the crew not to disturb it's best to just leave us alone 
 We huddled in the cargo hold next to our master's tomb 
 One deckhand snuck right down the stairs 
 Pretending I was still asleep I watched him meet his grisly end 
 As my master fed it took him and drained him of all of his life 
 One tentacle grabbed him before he could cry out for help 
 Through my master's eyes, I felt it as he died 
 Melding with my mind, I was horrified 
 I could not tell which thoughts were mine 
 It manipulates my mind I was beginning to unwind 
 I think I like it, Azim had finally given in 
 The beast was now inside of him 
 He served the monster's every whim, I tried to fight it 
 The crewman was lifeless quite dead and defiled 
 The beast threw his body, it splashed as it fell to the sea 
 Forced through the porthole flesh tearing without soul 
 I could not keep control of my terror 
 We finally reached the port of London in the dead of night 
 After several days we managed to secure this secret place 
 Through the darkness we moved the beast unseen by prying eyes 
 Where we began the task to remake the world in his image 
 All will be lost, across the sea of madness 
 We sail across the sea
