 Come Inside and sit my friend 
 I know you wonder why I've asked you to come here again 
 It seems were under siege 
 Come now and hear my wicked tale 
 All that I say is true you know we surely must prevail 
 Here's what you have to do 
 Borders now are closing in 
 It happened once before but now it's happening again 
 You know we have to win 
 There's only one way out we know here's what I have to show 
 You finally have realized I see it in you eyes 
 No you're never going to find a way 
 Out alive 
 No you're never going to get to say goodbye 
 I know you think we have a choise there is no other way 
 Now start by lowering your voice 
 Hear the words I say the time to judge has finally come 
 You know what must be done 
 I see your faith is growing strong I've told you all along 
 No you're never going to find a way 
 Out alive 
 No your never going to get to say goodbye 
 It all fades away why does it have to be this way 
 Time has come to stop the beast 
 You are the chosen one the one they call the Iron Priest 
 Disdain for the Middle East has festered in you for so long 
 Has made your will so strong 
 A time you've been preparing for another world war 
 Time is quickly running out I see you have your doubts 
 It's only natural to find the twists inside your mind 
 We chose you for your soul is pure you see we are quite sure 
 Your hesitation will be lost we all must pay the cost 
 No you're never going to find a way 
 Out alive 
 No your never going to get to say goodbye
