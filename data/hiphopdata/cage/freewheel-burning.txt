Fast and furious we ride the universe 
 To carve a road for us that slices every curve in sight 
 We accelerate, no time to hesitate 
 This load will detonate whoever would 
 Contend its right 
 Born to lead 
 At breakneck speed 
 With high octane 
 We're spitting flames 
 Freewheel burning 
 On we catapult, we're thrusting to the hilt 
 Unearthing every fault, go headlong into any date 
 We don't accept defeat, we never will retreat 
 We blaze with scorching heat obliterations everywhere 
 Look before you leap has never been the way we keep 
 Our road is free 
 Charging to the top and never give in never stops the 
 Way to be 
 Hold on to the lead with all your will and concede 
 You'll find there's life with victory on high
