(Music: Eric Horton / Sean Peck) 
 (Lyrics: Sean Peck) 
 I have come to show the truth the power and the way 
 If the tenth dimension far beyond all the things we can see 
 Lies a place of power and it holds al that you'll ever be 
 If you take the journey you will find all the answers you seek 
 You will fulfill a yearning and oh all the havoc you will wreak 
 You've got one foot in the grave 
 Take yourself to the brink 
 Like the razor blade of a knife 
 You begin to think 
 You need to be... 
 On the Edge 
 Falling again over the edge 
 Living your life on the edge 
 Feeling large and lethal and intoxicatingly cold 
 All those that will oppose you decimated by your stranglehold 
 As the Edge engulfs you and it just might envelope us all 
 Keep your feet beneath you and beware of the distance to fall 
 You've got one foot in the grave 
 Take yourself to the brink 
 Like the razor blade of a knife 
 You begin to think 
 You need to be... 
 On the Edge 
 Falling again over the edge 
 Living your life on the edge
