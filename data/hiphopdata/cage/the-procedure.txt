Come around the back, bring the man inside 
 Put him in this box, beware of prying eyes 
 He'll be waking soon, never tell a soul 
 There's no turning back, but you already know 
 Dim the lights draw your attention to the tables 
 Read him his last rights while his resistance is disabled 
 Chain the prisoner to the silver one do as you're told 
 Undress your wife and lay her on the one that's made of gold 
 Something's coming for them in the dead of the night 
 A nightmare that cannot be named - a creation 
 Not knowing they're releasing hidden horrors 
 Inside all so that she can be saved - transformation 
 Throw the switch, it's time to begin the procedure 
 Annabelle twitched, her body writhing like a seizure 
 It felt so soothing, something's moving beneath the floor 
 Lights were flashing, both were thrashing upon death's door 
 Annabelle was moaning with her eyes looking wild 
 Caught between pleasure and pain - a sensation 
 Next to her the prisoner was decaying inside 
 His skin turning blackened and stained - a mutation 
 Jarvis Felton was his name - transmutation 
 The crazy sound and lights that his machine had made 
 That chaos in the room now began to fade 
 Stand aside, l have to complete the procedure 
 Elliot cried, as he stuck her with a needle 
 A bright blue liquid, how he sticked it into her neck 
 Annabelle woke up, then rose up off the deck 
 Allistar had taken them on quite a ride 
 It all seemed to be so insane - a temptation 
 Felton's body shrivelled up and painfully died 
 Smoke rising from his remains - desecration 
 In the fading light, I witnessed something strange 
 Clinging to her back, I thought I saw some things 
 Transformation
