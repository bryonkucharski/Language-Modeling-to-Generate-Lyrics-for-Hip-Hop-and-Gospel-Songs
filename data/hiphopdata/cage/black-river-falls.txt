Deep in the cold midwestern snow way back in 1899 
 A wicked evil seemed to grow 
 It's taking over people's mind 
 Come here my child let me inside 
 No get away my head! 
 I have a mission for you and your friends 
 Help make the towns people dead 
 Madness is taking them over tonight 
 Madness will soon take its hold 
 Madness is taking them over tonight 
 Evil it lives in the cold 
 Little children it's in their minds 
 Little children lurk in the night 
 Little children why won't they die? 
 Little children lightning the fire! 
 Back in black river falls 
 Back in black river falls 
 Miss Watson gave birth to a child 
 Before it took its final breath 
 Her guilty conscience drove her wild 
 And so she choked her son to death 
 Infant disease flew on the breeze 
 Madness enveloped the town 
 Men went insane deeds so profane 
 Buildings were burnt to the ground 
 Little children it's in their yes 
 Little children gather tonight 
 Little children wicked children 
 Deadly children post 
 Father can you hear me? 
 I've been taken by something I can't explain 
 The voices in the darkness 
 Have told us to punish you all! 
 Father you should fear me 
 My mind it is possessed by an evil entity 
 This shameful place is forsaken 
 Poisoned by the sickness in all of you 
 We are coming tonight 
 Rising from their beds eyes were glowing red 
 One by one the cut the people down 
 Chaos filled the streets 
 Blood was running deep 
 Nothing was left living in the town 
 The morning sun shined on the scene 
 Such horror that cannot be said 
 The children wiped the village 
 Clean all of their parents lie there dead!
