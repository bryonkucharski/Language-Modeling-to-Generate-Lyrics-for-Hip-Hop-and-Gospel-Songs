 Follow me to the garden 
 Follow me and change your life 
 If you've cold and lonely lives that drag along 
 All the faces that you've known and the places that you've gone in this world 
 There is only one to who you belong 
 Don't ever let Love pass you by let them know 
 Do your feeling ever grow masked and dazed 
 They overload people wasting with such disconnected minds 
 In the dark they search for light no it's not the place that's right 
 What they've looking for few seldom ever find 
 Don't ever let Love pass you by take control 
 Just once in you life a Love like this will be known 
 It will never feel more right when together nothing's wrong 
 Time just slips away and is lowing when they're gone 
 Numb and shallow are the weak 
 You've got to know when your heart speaks 
 When the mind is quiet hear it sing it's song 
 Listen to your heart and hear what it says 
 Once in your life a love like this will be known 
 Feeling so strong you can't resist 
 Let yourself go 
 Wicked are lives when they're cast away they'll never know 
 A magic so electric like a raging dynamo 
 Up in the air into the sky their spirits float 
 A purifying passion wil unfold 
 Mating souls can't compromise such possessions are most prized 
 Find the silence deep within each others' eyes 
 Guided hands by loving ghosts they're the ones who know the most 
 The gift of destiny so graciousy bestowed 
 Once in your life a love like this will be known this of all things you must cherish 
 Joinings souls 
 Souls and Flesh
