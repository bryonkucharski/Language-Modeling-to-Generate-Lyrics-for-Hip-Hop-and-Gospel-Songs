Just out of prison and everything sucks 
 I am the king of bad luck 
 Hitchhiked to barstow then stole a car 
 Ten bucks in my pocket won't get me too far 
 Looking for action rage until I drop 
 Then in my rearview the lights of a cop 
 Catch me or kill me I'm not going back 
 Foot to the floor all dressed in black 
 I follow the lines on the road 
 Trouble wherever I go 
 Don't trust the eyes of a stranger in black 
 Thrill of a lifetime taking what is not mine 
 Bringing the pain is my addiction 
 Breaking their faces leaving no traces 
 Being insane is my affliction 
 Open the register give me the cash 
 Hand me your keys the last car I crashed 
 Don't you resist me I'm liable to freak 
 I prey on the innocent feed on the weak 
 My life has no meaning and yours even less 
 Crime is the way that I handle my stress 
 So liberating to have no regard 
 So pour me a drink and deal me some cards 
 And right when you think I'm gone I'll come again 
 I follow the lines on the road trouble wherever I go 
 Don't trust the eyes a stranger in black 
 Nowhere to call a place home no one will leave me alone 
 No wonder I ended up living my life the way that I do 
 A bottle of whiskey a 12 pack of beer 
 Drinking and smoking while truing to steer 
 Cigarette ashes that fall to the floor 
 My dark sunglasses all things I adore 
 A larcenous living is not for the faint 
 I ain't no devil but I ain't no saint 
 So don't ever knock what you never will try 
 If you say your life is fulfilled I tell you you die
