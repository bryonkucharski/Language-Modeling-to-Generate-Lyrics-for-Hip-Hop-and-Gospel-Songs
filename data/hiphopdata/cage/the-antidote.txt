I opened my eyes I was still alive, I bested the creature 
 I somehow survived I shook off the cobwebs became clear of mind 
 The weapon arcane I quickly would find it was crackling 
 I cut through beast with a brilliant blue beam 
 Carving just like a pumpkin on Halloween 
 Its brain was there it stunk the air as I freed it with my sword 
 I wrapped it in a burlap sack and prayed to my dear Lord 
 I've come too far to have you fail me now 
 Allistar must find a way somehow 
 Blue bag of brains, a cure he did promote 
 If he fails, I'll shove it down his throat - the antidote 
 I dragged it outside I looked for a ride 
 By the good grace of God a free horse was tied 
 I loaded the package with no time to waste 
 I asked for directions, I had to make haste 
 Blazing, I raced through the rain with a bag full of brains 
 Praying, that through all this pain my love would be saved 
 On my horse I raced the streets of London in the storm 
 I must return my Annabelle back to her true form 
 I hope she wasn't gone 
 I broke down the door 
 Then Annabelle tore Allistar's body in two 
 She screamed with a roar now fully transformed 
 I knew just what I had to do 
 The lab was on fire the flames getting higher 
 As the monster that was my wife came 
 Scraps from her dress in a tentacled mess 
 As she slithered I called out her name 
 Can you hear me my love God in heaven above 
 In her eyes I still see the blue 
 Then a tear formed and fell that the fires of hell 
 Would be extinguished if it were still you, but she was gone 
 My true love was gone, I had to move on 
 For the love of our son it was now breaking dawn 
 Her blue had turned black, there was no turning back 
 I parried and dodged while she pressed her attack 
 I was hating what I had to do as her inhumanity grew 
 Saying my last goodbye as tears filled my eyes 
 I drew the weapon, crackling light then brightly filled the room 
 Then with a flash I shot my wife and sent her to her doom 
 Then she was gone 
 I hope she wasn't gone
