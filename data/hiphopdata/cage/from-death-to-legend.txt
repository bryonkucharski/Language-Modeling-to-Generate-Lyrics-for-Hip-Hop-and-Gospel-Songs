With the dawn of his death we thought the war came to an end 
 With his last breath no one would listen again 
 The new world was weak, his passing was part of their plan 
 Now as we speak he's becoming much more than a man 
 Lost alone and forsaken 
 Surrounded by bodies that fell 
 You're the next to be taken 
 He's taking you with him to hell 
 Grant his majesty his final wish 
 Eliminate money and greed 
 Give him your hand and he'll give you his mark 
 Then you'll have all that you need 
 He went from death to legend 
 From death to legend 
 From death to legend and back again 
 From death to legend (Live by his lie he'll take you, nowhere to hide) 
 From death to legend (He'll break you taking, his mark will bring the end) 
 From death to legend and back again 
 Live by his lie he'll take you 
 Nowhere to hide 
 He'll break you taking his mark will bring the end 
 Statues and towers were built in his name 
 And still his power reached out from the grave 
 Voices and images telling us all to obey 
 Follow them flawlessly, he says that we'll all be saved 
 Lost alone and forsaken 
 Surrounded by bodies that fell 
 You're the next to be taken 
 He's taking you with him to hell 
 Grant his majesty his final wish 
 Eliminate money and greed 
 Give him your hand and he'll give you his mark 
 Then you'll have all that you need 
 He went from death to legend 
 From death to legend 
 From death to legend and back again 
 From death to legend (Live by his lie he'll take you, nowhere to hide) 
 From death to legend (He'll break you taking, his mark will bring the end) 
 From death to legend and back again 
 Lead us to slaughter just like the unknowing lamb 
 The lords of chaos held us in the palm of their hands 
 Lucifer's forces are gathering ready to strike 
 You've taken the chip marked by the Antichrist 
 Lost alone and forsaken 
 Surrounded by bodies that fell 
 You're the next to be taken 
 He's taking you with him to hell 
 Grant his majesty his final wish 
 Eliminate money and greed 
 Give him your hand and he'll give you his mark 
 Then you'll have all that you need 
 He went from death to legend 
 From death to legend 
 From death to legend and back again 
 From death to legend (Live by his lie he'll take you, nowhere to hide) 
 From death to legend (He'll break you taking, his mark will bring the end) 
 From death to legend and back again
