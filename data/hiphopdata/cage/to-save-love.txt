Tell me what do I have to do to save love? 
 Is there anything that I can do to save love? 
 I would do whatever I have to do 
 Track down this monster and then run it through 
 I'd brave any perils for you my dear love 
 The brain 
 Bring me its brain 
 The brain 
 I must have its brain 
 Then I can create a serum she can take 
 On my life this I will stake 
 It has one weakness, a dark spot on its head 
 Strike it fast and hard or you will wind up dead 
 Now go - we don't have much time 
 Arm yourself to the teeth 
 We don't have much time 
 Before it's too late
