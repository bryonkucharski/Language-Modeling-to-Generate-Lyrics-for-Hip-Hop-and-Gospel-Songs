Into the darkness, close to the truth, the sun was beginning to set 
 Clutching the hammer, I entered the grove armed with malicious intent 
 The great secret of the global elite was hidden deep in the trees 
 I made my way towards the towering cliffs close to their pagan disease 
 They have no souls 
 They worship death 
 Tied to the altar they'll take your last breath 
 The dark side coming out tonight 
 The dark side come with me tonight 
 By the light of the bohemian grove 
 The center of evil 
 They could take us all 
 I have to succeed, lord give me the power 
 I need to make all them bleed, I see it's all up to me 
 Covered and claoked, faceless and masked, the ceremony began 
 There by the lake, under the owl, bohemians started to chant 
 Ancient their tongue, one thousand or more, the dignitaries disguised 
 They tied down a woman, removing her robe, she was to be sacrificed 
 He took his blade 
 He held it high 
 The crowd screamed in ecstasy watching her die 
 The dark side coming out tonight 
 The dark side - Human sacrifice 
 There by the fire I witness bohemian grove 
 The dark side coming out tonight 
 The dark side - It's now time to strike 
 Gripping the hammer I quickly discarded my robe 
 I broke through the people and held the hammer up high 
 The look in his eyes as I struck him with all of my might 
 His blood soaked stained the night 
 I took flight as their leader had died 
 I had to escape, run from the grove and tell the tale that I saw 
 Vanishing quickly I slipped through the trees, the darkness would cover it all 
 Hundreds gave chase, the fear that I felt through the forest I ran 
 They're closing on me, I fight to break free and reveal his reptilian hand 
 Welcome my friend, you've come to the grove 
 We hope you've enjoyed your stay 
 You're never to leave or tell of this tale 
 Bohemians won't be betrayed
