 (Lyrics: Sean Peck) 
 Everyday everyday we struggle to survive 
 Such complicated lives 
 Feel the pain can't stand the strain 
 We constantly go through 
 Only one thing you can do 
 Seek separation 
 It brings to me expectations 
 Need escape get away 
 Seek shelter from the storm 
 Some place safe and warm 
 Find the flame the astral plane 
 Beyond the things we know 
 So damn bad I want to go 
 Separation it brings to me 
 Revalations 
 Release me release my soul 
 Release me let me go 
 Release me release me 
 Release me release me let me go 
 Find the truth seek proof the answer to it all 
 Will we rise of fall 
 When will it end does it begin and and the begin again 
 Take me with you won't you friend 
 Separation it brings to me 
 New sensations 
 Release me release my soul my soul 
 Release me let me go 
 Release me release me release me
