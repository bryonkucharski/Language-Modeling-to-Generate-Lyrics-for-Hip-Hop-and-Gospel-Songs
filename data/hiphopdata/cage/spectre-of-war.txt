My last drop of blood has fled from my wounds 
 Now I'm returning to dust 
 For glory and country I've given my life 
 Now I'm just a memory lost 
 Memory lost 
 My last living thoughts they flash through my mind 
 As I see in the distance a light 
 I summon my last ounce of strength bright 
 Lead me to paradise 
 Hear me my love as I call out your name 
 Call to you for the last time 
 Find solace and comfort in knowing the truth 
 The truth that this is not goodbye is not goodbye 
 My heartbeat is fading 
 My vision is weak as I lay amongst bodies and sand 
 Violence and love are both gifts from above 
 But war is the folly of man 
 All shield your eyes from the spectre of war 
 Justice is blind but not for the spectre of war 
 Tyrannic designs raises the spectre of war 
 Haunting our minds is the spectre of war
