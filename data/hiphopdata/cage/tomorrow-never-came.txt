My mood it reflects in the weather 
 Just at the dawn of daylight 
 I'm racing for home never more alone 
 I've been through one hell of a night 
 I remember when we got together 
 Never had two been more tight 
 When we became one, we gave birth to our son 
 Nothing could have been more right 
 And the leaves on the trees turned black 
 And the sun didn't rise and my world's foundation cracked 
 When all I loved died 
 Feeling total loss, kneeling at the cross l will hold you tight 
 When I meet you in the light eternal life we'll share 
 In a dream somewhere save me from despair 
 And you won't be there to meet me 
 And you won't be there to greet me 
 And you won't be by my side 
 You'll awake from death and find you in a light 
 That nearly blinds you and all the ones you loved 
 Are there with me 
 I spotted the home of Mrs. Watkins 
 Out from the chimney blew smoke 
 All that I'd done for my wife and my son 
 Of this nothing would be spoke 
 I gathered myself at the doorway 
 Approached and gave a gentle knock 
 I could not prepare for what was in there 
 Once again my world would be rocked 
 I waited for someone to answer 
 From inside there was not a sound 
 I opened the door what I was in for all of the family was found 
 There by the glow of the fire, I saw all the Watkins were dead 
 Close sat my son, God what had he done? 
 He looked towards me turning his head 
 And he said Daddy, Father, did you bring Mommy with you? 
 As you can see I'm very hungry 
 And these three people just won't do 
 How could he speak at just 36 weeks? 
 His voice had an inhuman tone 
 From his little frame black tentacles sprang 
 They had pierced the Watkins to the bone 
 Tomorrow never came 
 Elliot knew what he had to do to put a final end 
 To this madness he must take the life of his precious son 
 But were there yet others amongst the streets of London 
 Out there loose upon an unsuspecting world?
