Out of the emptiness 
 A flash engulfed the blackness of the night 
 On the seventh day 
 He waved his hand 
 And said let there be light 
 Out of the Vastness if the universe 
 He made he lives alone 
 His infinite omnipotence 
 Scans everything from high atop hos throne 
 Behold power of life 
 Power to kill bend to the will power of a God 
 Tremble in fear all who believe 
 Fall to your knees power of a God! 
 Flashing thunderbolts 
 And lightning liquefied the cosmic sky 
 Within a storm one lone blue planet 
 Formed itself within the eye 
 This was the one place God did designate 
 We congregate and breed 
 Such understanding 
 Is commanding you to purify belief 
 Slicing through eons 
 He carves up the heavens 
 With his celestial swarm 
 Blasting creation without hesitation 
 Vengeance is mine sayeth the lord 
 Galactic equation 
 Of pain and salvation 
 As dreams of oblivion soar 
 Incomprehensible 
 Not very sensible endless inaudible roar 
 Countless ages passed 
 At last he then sat up and judged it all 
 The foolish ways of man had sickened him 
 In fact he was appalled 
 So with a gesture this whole mess here 
 With no second thought erased 
 The wise beyonder then did to ponder 
 Just how we would be replaced 
 Rise to your feet 
 Join us and fell a power that is real
