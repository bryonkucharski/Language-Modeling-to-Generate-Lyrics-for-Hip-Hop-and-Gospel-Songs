On the horizon I scan the debris 
 Straight into danger I charge as they flee 
 My mission is clear now I know why they call 
 They've sent for the wrecker to vanquish them all 
 Once I was innocent once I knew love 
 They took from me everything was enough 
 There by the fire my red silhouette 
 Now I'm the mistake they won't live to regret 
 Born out of anger and strengthened by pain 
 He kills for the thrill now he's come back again 
 Don't beg him for mercy just pray for your life 
 His red shadow hunting for victims tonight 
 Speed kills violently shaking 
 Speed kills breaking apart 
 Speed kills disintegrating 
 Speed kills pounding your heart 
 Immovable object unstoppable force 
 Violently meeting I show no remorse 
 My enemies gather they stand in a line 
 Merciless judgement one life at a time 
 Under his cloak at the stroke of midnight 
 His infrared stare glaring laser red sights 
 Only in whispers they tell of his tale 
 Many have faced him and many have failed 
 Twisted forms that onde had souls 
 Now dead eyes stare under control 
 Armed with rage and poisoned minds 
 They fall before my death design 
 Racing forth to take my life 
 Under this sacred moonlit night 
 With my steel they'll meet their end 
 To the abyss they all descend 
 Your power has faced its meeting its end 
 My silence so deadly no way to defend 
 This desolate city no longer alive 
 I'm taking it over now all this is mine 
 Fast as a bullet fast as a shark 
 My killing addiction is deadly and dark 
 Faster than life faster than death 
 Faster and faster till nothing is left 
 Speed kills!
