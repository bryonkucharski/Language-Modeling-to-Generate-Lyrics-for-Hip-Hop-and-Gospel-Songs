What have you done my wife? 
 I'll beat you to an inch of your life 
 I'll try to explain if you kindly refrain 
 Then I sliced with the blade of my knife 
 Allistar I beat him bloody battered to the bone 
 My eyes were glazed with craziness 
 I lost all control 
 I drew my sword and pressed it squarely straight into his chest 
 I said tell me what have you done or I'll lay you to rest 
 A mystical place seen by no one 
 So we set off on the expedition 
 No turning back, nowhere to run 
 I now know my journey to hell had begun 
 Come with me come with me, on the expedition 
 Such secrets you will see, on the expedition 
 Let me take you back, not but ten years ago 
 A village in Egypt that I called my home 
 My father, a doctor well known 
 His dreams, he would share them alone 
 I learned his ways I could amaze the people with my healing 
 My destiny was not to be what Daddy did desire 
 I yearned to find the secrets that the desert was concealing 
 A longing for adventure in me burning like a fire 
 The tomb of Osiris buried under centuries of sand 
 I knew, I knew I had to find it 
 Something beckoned me and forced my hand 
 With my father's funding I assembled all the best 
 One hundred men, supplies and archaeologists 
 We set out in the sands and followed faded clues 
 Something strangely guided me 
 It somehow ted me to the tomb of Osiris 
 After forty days and night we finally came to the site 
 Gazing at the ruins by moonlight 
 We set up our camp and began to explore 
 Amazing the massive size of that door 
 Digging scraping excavating ruins in the dust 
 The writings on that giant door were warnings we should trust 
 They spoke about an ancient race, the old ones from the stars 
 My scientist's translations told of creatures quite bizarre 
 The tomb of Osiris buried under centuries of sand 
 I knew, I knew I had to find it 
 Something beckoned me and forced my hand 
 With my father's funding I assembled all the best 
 One hundred men, supplies and archaeologists 
 We set out in the sands and followed faded clues 
 Something strangely guided me 
 It somehow ted me to the tomb of Osiris 
 For twenty days and nights we worked at the site 
 Nothing we did would go right, trying to open that door 
 My men had not seen nothing like this before
