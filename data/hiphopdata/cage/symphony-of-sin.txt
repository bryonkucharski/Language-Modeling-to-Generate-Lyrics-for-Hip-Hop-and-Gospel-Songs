With this new weapon I ran through the maze, feeling inspired 
 My lamp and its blue trail guiding my gaze 
 As I sloshed through the mire 
 Getting closer now I see some stairs 
 The blue residue leading me there 
 Inhuman shrieks I can hear through the haze, condition dire 
 Hearing the horrors, what lies past this doorway? 
 When you dance with the devil, you risk your soul and your life 
 A trial by fire doing battle with the beast 
 Kill the beast or lose your wife 
 Soul or your life - son or your wife - a terrible destiny 
 I opened the door I was stunned by my eyes, it had to be fiction 
 There in the center the beast was alive, defying description 
 Worse than imagined huge and grotesque 
 Razor like mouth in the midst of its chest 
 People in cages hung from the skies, with the affliction 
 The monster was feeding - and also breeding 
 A choice that should never be 
 It's a symphony of sin 
 There is no good solution, there's no way to win 
 A symphony, a symphony of sin 
 The beast ripped the cages they crashed from the ceiling 
 Then creatures spilled out at me 
 I drew my revolvers and blasted away 
 At twisted shapes of humanity 
 My eye on their master they came at me faster 
 Killing another I climbed to the balcony 
 I threw down a bookcase crushing the mutate 
 And thought out loud now it's just you and me 
 Slashing and whipping and flailing away 
 It tore at the railing, I ran the other way 
 Timber was splintered and masonry cracked 
 I barely avoided these vicious attacks 
 I desperately daringly swung across the room 
 Grabbing the chains from the cages of doom 
 It's a symphony of sin 
 There is no good solution, there's no way to win 
 A symphony, a symphony of sin 
 It's a symphony of sin, he kept playing it over and over again 
 That symphony, that symphony of sin 
 Now from behind saw that spot on its head start to glow brighter 
 I drew the weapon and prayed to my god, and felt it igniting 
 I felt it attack like a spike through my lobe 
 Grabbing my head like brain would explode 
 Pulling the trigger I fired at the beast and blackness took over 
 I fell into darkness - from its psionics 
 A choice that should never be 
 It's a symphony of sin 
 There is no good solution, there's no way to win 
 A symphony, a symphony of sin 
 Had I just died? 
 Was the monster alive? 
 I'm seeing a tunnel of light
