(Music: Dave Garcia) 
 (Lyrics: Sean Peck) 
 When you feel scared or problems arise you need someone to hypnotize he will look in your mind 
 Instant induction a visual spash merging of emotions done so fast 
 Addictions in rewind. 
 He'll mentally molest you 
 Professionally trained 
 His evil will infest you. 
 Psychotically deranged 
 With an impression he'll make you sing neural linguistic programming 
 Who knows what he will find 
 Best to make sure nothing goes wrong 
 His power of suggestion is so strong 
 Your will he'll try to bind. 
 He'll mentally molest you 
 Professionally trained 
 His evil will infest you. 
 Psychotically deranged 
 He'll destroy your mental wall through hypnosis hear his call. 
 Hear his call 
 Hear his call. 
 Telling your future by reading your past 
 Past life regression removing yor mask 
 Feeding the frenzy that swarms in your head 
 What you're revealing is best left unsaid. 
 I'll snap my fingers then you'll awake 
 Your problems will linger 
 Your money I'll take. 
 So soothing the voice so bank are the eyes 
 It's all designed to mesmerize 
 Relax try to unwind 
 He's taking control he just won't let go 
 Done in such a way that you'll never know 
 You've got such little time 
 He'll mentally molest you 
 Professionally trained 
 His evil will infest you. 
 Psychotically deranged 
 Your true protector is your unconscious mind
