(Music: Eric Horton / Dave Garcia) 
 (Lyrics: Sean Peck) 
 Someone's listening to everything we say. 
 Nothing gets by them 
 Our hands are bound, they take the sounds and powerplay 
 We can't untie them 
 A web of networks covering us globally. 
 Unholy alliance 
 Echelon was started for our own security. 
 We just don't but it 
 Capture the words that you say. 
 Filtering dictionaries 
 Nowhere to run nowhere to hide, how will we ever escape? 
 Our lives they violate 
 Big brother hearing what you say, encompassing array 
 There's nowhere anyone can hide secrets or lies 
 When they scan you with their prying eyes, your words are analyzed 
 You never really know just 
 When they're listening in 
 Victim of a system we unknowingly play, how will it go? 
 What if there is something they don't want you to say, just when will they know? 
 Sprawling operations intercepting our minds and reading our screens. 
 Appalling indignations they're invading our lives, 
 Oh what does it mean? 
 Satellites are beaming information rays defying description 
 Telecommunication it never will be freed from their encryption 
 Capture the words that you say. 
 Filtering dictionaries 
 Nowhere to run nowhere to hide, how will we ever escape? 
 Our lives they violate 
 Big brother hearing what you say, encompassing array 
 There's nowhere anyone can hide secrets or lies 
 When they scan you with their prying eyes, your words are analyzed 
 You never really know just 
 When they're listening in
