(Music: Dave Garcia) 
 (Lyrics: Sean Peck) 
 Here we are asking again where is GOD? 
 It's breaking us down we're feeling so lost 
 In solitude why don't you explore a way that is new that shakes you to the core. 
 A resonating voice from afar 
 Listen very close to the stars and then never again will you fall. 
 What does it mean? 
 How does it know? 
 It's the final solution. 
 Just when you think there is no place to go it's the final solution. 
 Clouded are minds of men 
 Where is GOD? 
 Some say we face diminishing odds 
 Celestial mechanics will restore 
 Human destiny will be reborn. 
 A resonating voice from afar 
 Listen very close to the stars and then never again will you fall. 
 What does it mean? 
 How does it know? 
 It's the final solution. 
 Just when you think there is no place to go it's the final solution. 
 The secret of the zodiac lies within. 
 Living a life of sin where is GOD? 
 Darkest are things before the dawn. 
 The resurrection of your spirit is near 
 Feel its' evolution while you hear... 
 A resonating voice from afar 
 Listen very close to the stars and then never again will you fall. 
 What does it mean? 
 How does it know? 
 It's the final solution. 
 Just when you think there is no place to go it's the final solution.
