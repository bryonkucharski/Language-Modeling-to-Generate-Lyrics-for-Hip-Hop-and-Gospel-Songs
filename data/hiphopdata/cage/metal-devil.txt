Metal demon! Metal devil! Metal demon! Metal devil! 
 Light from the darkness, a century since his demise 
 Up from the ashes the evil machine will arise 
 Titanium tendons and sinews of steel - This merciless master of metal 
 666 innocent souls will bring back the devil to life 
 We see them in the night : the legions are leaving the light 
 Forever and a day it's taken to make him awake 
 They kept evil alive, the devil never died, the dark lord will arise 
 Metal devil - They kept evil alive, the new world won't survive, a sacrilegious sight 
 Metal devil - Uncrucified (metal devil), the lord of lies (metal devil), extinguisher of light 
 Metal devil! 
 Deep in the dungeon, all preparations were set 
 Dark resurrection, years of imbalance reset 
 Infernal invention to siphon your souls : six hundreds spirits were taken 
 Sixty-six others were eaten alive, witness the dawn of damnation 
 We see them in the night : the legions are leaving the light 
 Forever and a day it's taken to make him awake 
 They kept evil alive, the devil never died, the dark lord will arise 
 Metal devil - They kept evil alive, the new world won't survive, a sacrilegious sight 
 Metal devil - Uncrucified (metal devil), the lord of lies (metal devil), extinguisher of light 
 Metal devil! 
 Rise master! What is thy bidding dark lord? 
 Blast through the doorway, into the light of the age 
 Legions of subjects horribly born to obey 
 The sound of his circuitry sizzles and cracks this towering titan of terror 
 He raises his arms to the people below and issues the final command 
 We see them in the night : the legions are leaving the light 
 Forever and a day it's taken to make him awake 
 They kept evil alive, the devil never died, the dark lord will arise 
 Metal devil - They kept evil alive, the new world won't survive, a sacrilegious sight 
 Metal devil - Uncrucified (metal devil), the lord of lies (metal devil), extinguisher of light 
 Metal devil!
