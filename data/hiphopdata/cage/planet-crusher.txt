Our peaceful world 
 Was ripe for the taking 
 Forgotten were the ways of war 
 His Herald and Harbinger came from the heavens 
 Saying you will be no more 
 He had no expression 
 Showed no emotion 
 His skin it gleamed like a pearl 
 There is no escape from my master he said 
 For he is the devourer of worlds 
 Devourer of worlds 
 All of our forces combined 
 Were useless against his assault 
 He swatted us down with effortless care 
 Bringing our world to a halt 
 Since the beginning of time 
 He has revenged through systems 
 And fed on the hearts of the stars 
 In the fabric of space 
 Lies his path of destruction 
 Littered with sorrow and scarred 
 One by one world after world 
 Galaxies tremble in fear 
 Horrible screams in the vacuum of space 
 Cries that no one will fear 
 Planet Crusher feed to survive 
 Planet Crusher none left alive 
 Devastator death from the sky 
 Your creator has left you to die 
 Devourer of worlds 
 Master of time master of space 
 Ravage your world and wipe out your race 
 Master of speed master of death 
 Fall to your knees 
 And take your last breath 
 Nothing can harm him 
 Nothing can stop him 
 Save the deprivation of food 
 He has no allegiance 
 Shows no alignment 
 Is neither evil nor good 
 His ambivalent anger is ruled by thirst 
 He speeds through wormholes and time 
 So look to the sky and pray to your god 
 Your homeworld won't be next in line 
 Planet crusher devourer of worlds
