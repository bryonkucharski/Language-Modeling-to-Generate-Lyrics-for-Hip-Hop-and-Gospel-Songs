The cities still burn 
 Man will not return 
 I have no one to turn to 
 There is no kingdom for me 
 This is not how I was told it would be 
 I have but one choice left 
 One way to go 
 One last chance to save my soul 
 Vanquished when the angels fall 
 The dark will be once and for all 
 What have I done? 
 Just what have I done? 
 What have I done? 
 I know what must be done
