 (Lyrics: Sean Peck) 
 You know right from the start 
 They rip society apart 
 With fear they spread their lies 
 When will you people realize 
 Reducing our rights they're taxing the lights 
 They keep taking more and more 
 The more laws they make the freedoms they take 
 What else do they have in store 
 Control the TV news 
 The shameless tactics that they use 
 They'll take us all to Hell 
 Before that I will stand and yell 
 I live you die 
 We will rise up and we will defy 
 I live 
 Command and control economy slows 
 And watch the Government grow 
 The people don't scare it's breeding despair 
 We're sinking so very low 
 I live you die 
 Nowhere from us will they ever hide 
 I live 
 Ideas are old respect they have stole 
 Their coffers are filled with gold 
 The communist way's the road that they've paved 
 We need to escape their hold 
 I live you die 
 Conservative answers we will find 
 I live 
 Yes I live 
 I live you die
