Deep into the future 
 I went as far and fast as I could 
 It was there at the edge of the infinite 
 On the precipice I stood 
 Show yourself to me I cried! 
 Have you nothing at all to say 
 Like no time ever before 
 He appeared without delay 
 At last he had finally come to me 
 To me finally he spoke 
 Although my power was nearly limitless 
 It was always his name that they invoked 
 Is this the end asked? 
 As the last of the galaxies fell into the void 
 His silent voice was all encompassing 
 Half amused and part annoyed You are the last to ask he said 
 And so I leave it up to you to decide 
 Then yes let this be the end 
 Let this be the end of it all I replied 
 I then watched as the last star flickered 
 Extinguished by the billowing black 
 As my consciousness gently faded 
 I knew nothing would ever come back
