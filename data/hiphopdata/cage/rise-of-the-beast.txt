Rise! Rise! Rise! Prepare for the rise of the beast! 
 Rise! Rise! Rise! Prepare for the rise of the beast! 
 He's come to bring the end of days 
 Raised in the arts of black magic ways 
 A pawn the lords of chaos play 
 Made to be king bringing doomsday 
 He will protect you from harm - A lie! 
 He can do no wrong - Another lie! 
 He is the answer to all of your prayers 
 The world's falling under his spell 
 Rise! Rise! Rise! Prepare for the rise of the beast! 
 Rise! Rise! Rise! Prepare for the rise of the beast! 
 A silent tyrant on his throne 
 Tongue like a serpent, heart like a stone 
 Sovereign nations shall behold 
 One man to lead them, they'll do what they're told 
 He will protect you from harm - A lie! 
 He can do no wrong - Another lie! 
 He is the answer to all of your prayers 
 The world's falling under his spell 
 Rise! Rise! Rise! Prepare for the rise of the beast! 
 Rise! Rise! Rise! Prepare for the rise of the beast! 
 Come to the line all your children of the night, see the metal shine in the full moonlight 
 Push the limit farther then you ever had to go until you're out of control 
 Come to the line all your children of the night, see the metal shine in the full moonlight 
 Push the limit farther then you ever had to go until you're out of control 
 Come to the line, see the metal shine, he is the king of tomorrow - Death, despair and sorrow! 
 Nations united in his prayer 
 His words mesmerize them his hypnotic stare 
 This new world branded by his sign 
 All hail his image, all get in line 
 He will protect you from harm - A lie! 
 He can do no wrong - Another lie! 
 He is the answer to all of your prayers 
 The world's falling under his spell 
 Rise! Rise! Rise! Prepare for the rise of the beast! 
 Rise! Rise! Rise! Prepare for the rise of the beast! 
 You're feeling a loss of control - Faster for the master 
 You're sinking below - Faster for the master 
 None shall be saved - Faster for the laster 
 Ye of little faith - Faster for the master
