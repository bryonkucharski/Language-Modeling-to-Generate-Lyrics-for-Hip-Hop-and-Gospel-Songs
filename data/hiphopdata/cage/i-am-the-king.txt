Born into fire, die by the blade 
 This is the life I have made 
 Now the war's coming on again 
 Treacherous dog end this charade 
 I'm coming to put you away 
 I put fear in the hearts of men 
 Legions are gathering deep in the night, 
 Prepare for the end of your reign 
 Might and magic will finally collide, 
 The heavens will tremble and shake 
 Hail! Hail! Born to be king! 
 Hail! Hail! Rule everything! 
 Hail! Hail! Stand by my side 
 As a legend is born tonight! 
 I've been to hell and back to overtake the throne 
 I am the king! 
 This wicked legacy is mine and mine alone 
 I am the king! 
 Your twisted treachery, this bloodbath has been settled 
 I am the king! 
 Bow down and kiss the ring, I wear the crown of metal 
 The king! 
 Sinew and steel will carry the day 
 Slashing and blasting away 
 No more will you claim this land 
 Sick is your sorcery, ill is your mind 
 No mercy from me you will find 
 I'll strike you down where you stand 
 Legions are gathering deep in the night 
 Prepare for the end of your reign 
 Might and magic will finally collide 
 The heavens will tremble and shake 
 Hail! Hail! Born to be king! 
 Hail! Hail! Rule everything! 
 Hail! Hail! Stand by my side 
 As a legend is born tonight! 
 I've been to hell and back to overtake the throne 
 I am the king! 
 This wicked legacy is mine and mine alone 
 I am the king! 
 Your twisted treachery, this bloodbath has been settled 
 I am the king! 
 Bow down and kiss the ring, I wear the crown of metal 
 The king!
