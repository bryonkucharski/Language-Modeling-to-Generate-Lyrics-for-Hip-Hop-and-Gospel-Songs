I met a girl, it was Christmas Eve 
 I tried so hard to get her to leave 
 She spoke to me with an open mouth 
 Just right then I had no doubt she was a... 
 Braindead woman, what did she said? 
 Braindead woman, out of my way 
 Braindead woman, she don't understand 
 Braindead woman, back of my hand 
 Got one purpose, it's so clear 
 Get her drunk with just one beer 
 Look so good, it's such a shame 
 Tell me what happened to her brain 
 Just not blondes who act this way 
 Chicks like this they have a way 
 Of making smart girls seems so bad 
 The best fuck that I ever had was a... 
 Braindead woman! 
 (Solo: Dave) 
 Don't you let her speak her mind 
 Nothing worthy you will find 
 Braindead woman, go to school 
 Don't waste my time with that you fool 
 Even though you are this way 
 And I hate every word you say 
 Braindead woman you're my love 
 The only girl I'm thinking of 
 Braindead woman!
