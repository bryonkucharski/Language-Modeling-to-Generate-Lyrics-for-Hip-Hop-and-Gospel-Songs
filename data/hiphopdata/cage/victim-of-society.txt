(Music: Dave Garcia) 
 (Lyrics: Sean Peck) 
 In the early morning when you open up your eyes 
 Just heed this warning seek the truth behind the lies 
 They will steal, rape, and murder say it is not their fault 
 Still you all believe them something is wrong 
 People today here is the key 
 Take responsibility for what you do 
 How did we end up this far from principles on who we are they are askew 
 Who is next to be victim of society? 
 Is it you? 
 How many times do we see people plead insanity 
 They say they are sick 
 People can bust or they will vent 
 They will blame their enviironment 
 That should do the trick 
 Who is next to be victim of society? 
 Is is you? 
 It is not me! 
 Now the line is burring between what is right and wrong 
 Where are the values that we have been taught all along? 
 Never will we bow before them or give in to such change 
 The clean hands of righteous soon filled with bloodstrains 
 The operative word of the day is dysfunctional 
 Throw it away and face yourself 
 Lock them up and throw away the key 
 That would be all right with me and you! 
 Who is next to be victim of society? 
 Is is you? 
 Stop it now 
 Don't be so quick to blame someone else because 
 When you look deep inside you will find it is you
