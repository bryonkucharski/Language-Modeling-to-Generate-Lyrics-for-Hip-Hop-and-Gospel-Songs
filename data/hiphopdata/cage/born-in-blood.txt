Rise almighty dark lord for all that is unholy 
 Bring your blasphemous reign upon this tormented land 
 Born from a sea of blood, take power and devour 
 Rise, oh master, and bring forth revelation 
 Steal the blood for the beginning, the beginning of the end 
 We're the ones to do the sinning, we need a leader to ascend 
 Taken from his bloody image, extract and violate 
 The shroud of Turin we will pillage for evil incarnate 
 He'll feel the light upon his face 
 And fuel the fight as God's erased 
 Brought to life a duplicate 
 He'll mastermind man's fall from grace 
 Stealing the light 
 Bringer of pain and enveloping black 
 Follow him blindly, he'll lead us to war 
 He who both is and is not 
 Born in the blood bled from the son 
 We will fight 
 Nothing will stop us from raping the world 
 Bow and forever they'll heed and obey 
 Be this the first act of war 
 Born in the blood 
 War has begun! 
 From a most unholy science we turned the savior to the beast 
 Ruling with a fist of iron and spreading our disease 
 Abandon all your hope and courage ye who enter here 
 For we will usher in a new age of blasphemy and fear 
 He'll feel the light upon his face 
 And fuel the fight as God's erased 
 Brought to life a duplicate 
 He'll mastermind man's fall from grace 
 Stealing the light 
 Bringer of pain and enveloping black 
 Follow him blindly, he'll lead us to war 
 He who both is and is not 
 Born in the blood bled from the son 
 We will fight 
 Nothing will stop us from raping the world 
 Bow and forever they'll heed and obey 
 Be this the first act of war 
 Born in the blood 
 War has begun! 
 I am reborn but wait, I'm feeling my soul hesitates 
 They tell me that I am the son of the devil 
 They bow to me, I am the one 
 Dreams and schemes are being whispered into our master's ears 
 Decimating the resistance, their hope will disappear 
 The spider's web that we are weaving, their presence he will grace 
 Politicians will be grieving their power is replaced 
 He'll feel the light upon his face 
 And fuel the fight as God's erased 
 Brought to life a duplicate 
 He'll mastermind man's fall from grace 
 Stealing the light 
 Bringer of pain and enveloping black 
 Follow him blindly, he'll lead us to war 
 He who both is and is not 
 Born in the blood bled from the son 
 We will fight 
 Nothing will stop us from raping the world 
 Bow and forever they'll heed and obey 
 Be this the first act of war 
 Born in the blood 
 War has begun! 
 Born in the blood 
 Abomination
