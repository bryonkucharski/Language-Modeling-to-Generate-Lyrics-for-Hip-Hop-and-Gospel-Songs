I sold my soul to the Devil 
 I sacrificed myself for one I had to save 
 Now I roam the road 
 Dressed in black leather 
 A flaming skeleton 
 That's wrapped with spikes and chains 
 I live my life alone 
 No turning back 
 Ill turn your soul to stone 
 My reasons are my own 
 So stare deep in my eyes 
 The evil inside you 
 Will eat you alive 
 Wheels burning the night 
 The spirit of vengeance 
 Will be by your side 
 Satanic speed avenging angel 
 Many mortal fool 
 Have challenged me and failed 
 Upon my steed I search for danger 
 The flesh of enemies 
 Beneath my wheels impaled 
 Ghost rider 
 Speeding, leaving 
 A terrible trail of fire 
 In the presence of evil 
 I change and I leave 
 All the wicked people to die 
 Blazing, razing 
 Hell hath no fury like mine 
 Like festering maggots 
 Feeding on flesh 
 On the souls of sinners I dine 
 My victims scream 
 The pay their penance 
 My brutal means are just my dark way to an end 
 Their twisted dreams 
 No longer menace 
 I am a nightmare 
 All the righteous I defend 
 Spirit of Vengeance
