 (Lyrics: Sean Peck) 
 Destiny, that is what I saw in you 
 I was so mistaken a love that wasn't true 
 The things you kept inside 
 Important issues that you hide but why do you still linger in my mind 
 You're coming 
 I'll start running 
 You're far too late to save our love tonight 
 My feelings that you vandalize 
 Well there is nothing to say but good bye 
 My feelings that you vandaize just one too many lies 
 Bleeding my heart is split in two 
 Half seft preservation the other is not with you 
 Ten too many times pain and fate became entwined escape 
 You're oblivious you're blind 
 You're coming 
 I'll start running 
 You're far too late to save our love tonight 
 My feelings that you vandalize 
 Well there is nothing to say but good bye 
 My feelings that you vandaize just one too many lies 
 No no no! 
 You felt it coming and so did you 
 Apologetic crap that you spew 
 You tried to mend it I closed the gate 
 Now I'm teling you not to wait 
 The time invested was such a waste 
 Now you left my mouth with a bitter taste 
 So high is your maintenance 
 You just don't know what you want I can't be your sustenance 
 You don't know that you need something that I just can't feed our love is no longer growing 
 It's slowing slowing slowing! 
 My feelings that you vandalize 
 Well there is nothing to say but good bye 
 My feelings that you vandaize just one too many lies 
 My feelings feelings 
 My feeling that you Vandalize
