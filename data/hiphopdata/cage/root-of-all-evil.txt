 (Lyrics: Sean Peck) 
 Something's going wrong 
 It formulated in Babylon 
 Today we lie trapped on a cross of gold 
 How far will we fall 
 The color red engulfs us all 
 We're sinking and drowning in their greed 
 Oh no 
 Take it away take their power away 
 The people are running scared 
 Take their power away 
 Nobody cares 
 The Feds who reserve 
 Their our master as slaves me serve 
 The ones that Christ called the Pharisees 
 They've taken control 
 Because everything in life is tolled 
 Lincoln said money power preys on peace 
 Oh no 
 Take it away 
 Take their power away of freedom will start to fade 
 Take their power away this prison they made 
 The root of all evil you're holding in your hands 
 The root of all evil we're victims of their plans 
 Illuminati, the new world order is now 
 The future looks so dark 
 Soon they'll ask you to take their mark 
 To count you and make you do their deeds 
 The youth of today are seeing through these wicked ways 
 This system and it's oppression is obsolete 
 Oh no 
 Take it away take their power away 
 Jefferson's warning heard 
 Take their power away 
 Nobody's learned 
 The root of all evil you're holding in your hands 
 The root of all evil we're victims of their plans 
 The root of all evil corrosive currency 
 The root of all evil constant usury
