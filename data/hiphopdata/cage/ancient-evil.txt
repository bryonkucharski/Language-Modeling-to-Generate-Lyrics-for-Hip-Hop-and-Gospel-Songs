My name is Elliot Worthington 
 My loving wife is ill nothing can be done 
 To make matters worse 
 We have a nine month old son 
 We're leaving the seventh physician 
 We've seen in London 
 Crawling out of the shadows 
 Creeping into our lives 
 Desperate are the measures 
 Terrible are the times 
 An ancient evil can't ever be controlled 
 Don't make a mistake and invite evil into your life 
 Ancient evil, ancient evil... an ancient evil 
 Azim is my name don't be afraid 
 Twisted and crippled 
 I am as I was made 
 I work for a man by his hand 
 Annabelle can be saved 
 But please don't ask me how 
 I know your wife's name 
 He handed me a piece of paper 
 He said to me go there tonight 
 He slipped away into the alley 
 It was the year of 1869 
 An ancient evil can't ever be controlled 
 Don't make a mistake and invite evil into your life 
 An ancient evil, don't ever justify 
 Or your soul will be paying the price 
 Evil it's on the rise 
 Ancient evil 
 I took his advice and did just what he said 
 I've nothing to lose my wife soon would be dead 
 I've something to show you 
 That just might save your bride 
 Bring me a living soul back to my lair 
 A life for a life it only seems fair 
 This procedure will take place tomorrow night 
 I swear by my name Allistar all will be made right 
 I returned to find my lady kneeling 
 Passing out onto the floor 
 Another soul I would be stealing 
 But Annabelle would be restored 
 An ancient evil can't ever be controlled 
 Don't make a mistake and invite evil into your life 
 An ancient evil, don't ever justify 
 Or your soul will be paying the price 
 Evil it's on the rise 
 Ancient evil 
 An evil deep in London has arrived!
