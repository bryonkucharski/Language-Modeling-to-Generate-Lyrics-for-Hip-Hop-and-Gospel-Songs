I knew what I had to do, arming myself as I stared into the 
 Blackness of the catacombs before me 
 A trail of fluorescent blue residue dimly lit the path the monster 
 Had made. I took one last look back at my wife as she lay there 
 In a surreal, peaceful rest 
 I had no choice but to leave her there with Allistar whom I had 
 Just beaten to within an inch of his life. As I took my first step 
 Towards the unknown terrors I thought, truly this be the valley of 
 The shadow of death, but I shall fear no evil. Christ protect me
