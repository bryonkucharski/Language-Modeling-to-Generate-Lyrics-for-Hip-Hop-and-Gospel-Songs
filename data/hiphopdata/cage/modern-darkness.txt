(Music: Dave Garcia) 
 (Lyrics: Sean Peck) 
 Just why does it rise up once again 
 Just what message does it send 
 You see malevolance is real 
 The two sides of all you feel 
 Are you the evil are you bad 
 Seeking the answers drives you mad 
 I know you're coming you're so near 
 I believe in you, 
 I believe in you, 
 I do 
 Do thing just happen randomly 
 Or do the forces make them be 
 You need to find which side you are on 
 Embrace the darkness and you're gone 
 I believe in you, 
 I believe in you, 
 You'll see 
 In mordern darkness that's where you thrive 
 There is no question you are alive 
 I cannot hear you 
 I cannot see 
 You're still around me you'll always be 
 When I get angry or I get scared 
 You try to take hold and grab your share 
 That's what you live for that's what you do 
 You move so quickly I never knew 
 Just look around you and you'll see 
 Death and destruction constantly 
 If there's a God why don't you hear 
 The cries of anguish loud and clear 
 I believe in you, 
 I believe in you, 
 I do
