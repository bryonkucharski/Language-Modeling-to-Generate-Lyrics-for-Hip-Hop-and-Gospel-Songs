(Music: Eric Horton) 
 (Lyrics: Sean Peck) 
 They come seeking adventure they come from miles around 
 Practicing discretion they hardly make a sound 
 You've really got to go there and see it for yourself 
 For some hedonistic pleasure just be careful of your health 
 Silence is golden when you visit this place 
 Dare the darkened hallways and flashing neon lights 
 >From fantasy to fetish you won't believe your eyes 
 Al that you desire is there for you to touch 
 But you've got to know your limits so don't indulge too much 
 Silence is golden when you visit this place 
 The secrets your holding don't tell a soul, prevent your disgrace 
 Broken dreams running through the Red Light District come with men 
 Many people stay 
 Others run away you know it can be rough 
 We just can't get enough 
 The coffee shops and spacecakes are soothing to your soul 
 What difference does it make there's no need for control 
 If just takes fifty gilders and lust and sin are live 
 It will leave you so bewilclered 
 I hope you can survive 
 Silence is golden when you visit this place 
 The secrets you're holding don't tell a soul, prevent your disgrace 
 Broken dreams running through the Red Light District come with men
