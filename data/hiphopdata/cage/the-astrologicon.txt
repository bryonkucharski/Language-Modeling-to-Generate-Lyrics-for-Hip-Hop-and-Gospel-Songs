 Hidden from evil the book and its secrets remain 
 Holding the key to the future and just want our God's preordained 
 Protected by priests made of iron containing omnipotent force 
 Stronger and wise become holy eyes as the union begins with the source 
 We're all seeking the light 
 Fallen savior 
 No! we're all seeking the light 
 Fallen savior 
 The book has a name the stories are true there is no end to what it can do 
 Reading the pages they seemed to be coming 
 Deciphered in stages revealling the legend of time 
 More ancient then all other scriptures this coveted relic of signs 
 Designed to endure enshrined to the pure now the truth will be told this time 
 We're all seeking the light 
 Fallen savior 
 No! we're all seeking the light 
 Fallen savior 
 The book has a name the stories are true there is no end to what it can do 
 Using the Astrologicon and watching the sky the Vatican gained clairvoyance and the power to make other die 
 We're all seeking the light 
 Fallen savior 
 No! we're all seeking the light 
 Fallen savior 
 Power corrupting it's too much for one man to hold 
 Imbalance disrupting the war for the struggle of souls 
 Existence is no longer secret we're facing a perilous plight 
 The book has a cost distinction is lost between the dark and the light 
 We're all seeking the light 
 Fallen savior 
 No! we're all seeking the light 
 Fallen savior 
 The book has a name the stories are true there is no end to what it can do 
 The purest intentions are melting away with the coming fight 
 Evil is beckoning born to betray 
 Watch the King and the Fallen angel rise
