Slain upon the battlefield somehow I didn't die 
 I rose to stand upon my feet then soared up to the sky 
 My mind became injected with the knowledge of all time 
 Some men call me the spectre beware my watchful eye 
 Now you will fall before the dread of my might 
 Pray pray for the dawn of first light a fate worse than death 
 Science of annihilation 
 Charge into the breach of the fight Rage raging with no end in sight 
 No turning back science of annihilation 
 The spectre of war is looming tonight 
 I am the injector beware of my sight 
 The spectre of war all shall obey I am destructor of all I survey 
 The spectre of war The spectre of war 
 The spectre of war is looming tonight 
 They knew me by so many names a pagan god of war 
 For centuries I roamed the earth now legendary lore 
 The battle lines have been drawn we may not see the dawn 
 Chaos and order divide religion and science collide 
 Atoms and molecules spirits and souls 
 Master creator meets master control 
 Fret for your life should the spectre appear 
 For he's a foreshadowing soothsaying seer 
 I became immortal with the power of a God 
 Reborn I did manipulate the scores of kings and pawns 
 These wars I did facilitate this world was full of sin 
 Watching men kill other men and kill and kill again 
 See how they... 
 The spectre of war some men call me 
 The spectre 
 Beware my watchful eye
