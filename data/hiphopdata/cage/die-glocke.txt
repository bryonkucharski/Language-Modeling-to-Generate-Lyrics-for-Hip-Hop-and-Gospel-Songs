A secret of the darkest kind 
 A legion of 62 scientific minds 
 The black sun did command 
 Make a weapon that no man 
 Or army could withstand 
 Gerlach would lead them all 
 A burden that he bore 
 Succeed and win the war 
 Build a force that's irresistible 
 The source of their demise 
 Proportions so combustible 
 Our victims vaporized 
 Violence so unstoppable 
 We're born to terrorize 
 Fight fight for your life fight to the death die glocke 
 Fight stand up and fight fight to death die glocke 
 They constructed the device 
 In a polish mine deep as hell 
 Tortured steel with the shape of a massive bell 
 From the north tower to the nest 
 Take seven of your best and proceed with the first test 
 The chamber fired a flash then quantum theory crashed 
 The men were turned to ash 
 They turned on the machine 
 And they heard the engine whine 
 Black technology xerum 525 
 Magnetic alchemy that no life form can survive 
 Astonished by this wonder weapon 
 Twisting space and time 
 The called the mine the beehive for the wicked sound it made 
 Near the polish border it was buried like a grave 
 All was lost for the Reich it was axis denied 
 General Sporrenberg had a cure to prescribe 
 For silence to remain 
 And the Reich to live again all 62 were slain 
 No one was left to talk 
 They flooded all the rock 
 And saved us from die glocke 
 How did the bell just disappear 
 And vanish with no trace 
 Some say it's in the amazon a secret Nazi base 
 Or buried in Antarctica amongst the frozen waste 
 Or did it fall in Kecksburg from Andromedean space 
 Die glocke
