I woke from a dream to a camp full of screams 
 And sounds so obscene, what was out there? 
 By the light of the moon the door of his tomb 
 I saw was removed, death everywhere 
 On this black starry night this monster will feast 
 Some kind of god, some kind of beast 
 Old as the stars, master of men 
 It's the beginning and it is the end 
 Stare in the eye of the Beholder 
 Sanity's lost, there's no escape 
 Burning your mind, it starts to smolder 
 You have been caught, your mind has been raped 
 Stare into the eye of the Beholder 
 Fast as a snake no way to escape such a horrible fate 
 A river of blood stained the sands 
 Again and again both camels and men 
 Were slaughtered right then, they had no chance 
 Beyond belief hard to describe, tentacles twisting up to the sky 
 Huge as a house skin slimy and black, eight horrible eyes staring straight back 
 Fifteen of us left standing alive, paralyzed as it spoke to our minds 
 A rush of its thoughts invaded my head, a lesser mind would have gone mad 
 "I have awakened, you are now mine" 
 There was no other choice to be had 
 It would mandate we shared its fate to repopulate the world with it 
 It went back inside take me for a ride, of course we'd abide on to England 
 Repeat Prechorus Chorus
