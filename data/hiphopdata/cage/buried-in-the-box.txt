 (Lyrics: Sean Peck) 
 Well you know one time it was tenn till two 
 We were drinking wine we were smoking too 
 We had three young girls they had not one care 
 Well we pulled them out, you know what it's about 
 And I asked them where? 
 They said it's 
 Buried in the box don't you try to blame me 
 Buried in the box 
 Buried in the box don't you try to shame me 
 Buried in the box 
 When we're kicking ass well it's n the stage 
 When we play real fast you know the people rage 
 When they hear the sound they don't know how 
 'Cause it's so profound it's hidden underground 
 Let me show you now 
 Buried in the box 
 Buried in the box don't you try to blame me 
 Buried in the box 
 Buried in the box don't you try to shame me 
 Buried in the box 
 Well they don't know how they can hear the sound 
 If it's so damn loud we're gonna show all of you 
 When we hit the road we do it double time 
 We pack a load and hear our girlfriends whine 
 We don't compromise you know it's true 
 World to the wise you better realize 
 Coming straight for you 
 Buried in the box 
 Buried in the box don't you try to blame me 
 Buried in the box 
 Buried in the box don't you try to shame me 
 Buried in the box
