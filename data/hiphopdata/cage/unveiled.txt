(Music: Eric Horton) 
 (Lyrics: Sean Peck) 
 In the Earth's first days they came with high technology 
 Mutagenic lives would thrive they germinated seeds 
 They came unto this world with two infants to breed 
 The grand experiment was called Adam and Eve 
 Birth of a civilization becoming unveiled 
 Top secret classification 
 They cannot let religion fall 
 As the ages passed so little evidence remained 
 We turned to mysticism for the unexplained 
 The modern day has made the skepticism grow 
 When comes Millennium the world will finally know 
 Birth of a civilization becoming unveiled 
 Top secret classification 
 They cannot let religion fall 
 They're coming back to find you you better run away 
 They're seeking up behind you 
 They're taking you away 
 They come down and take you up into the sky 
 You scream aloud "God help me!" they ask you why 
 You call out to a god when it's just us up here 
 The harsh reality consumes you with despair 
 Birth of a civilization becoming unveiled 
 Top secret classification 
 Now you know religion failed 
 It's coming unveiled 
 Becoming unveiled
