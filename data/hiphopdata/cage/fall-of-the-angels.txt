I'll make you an offer you cannot refuse 
 I'm journeying back from the black 
 Based one my theory when he's weak and weary 
 Send war angels in to attack 
 I'll make him appear, I'll have to be there to dignify this deceit 
 Can you deliver, it's slim as silver our chances to bring his defeat 
 For the moment I sold him my immortal soul 
 This deal's gotten worse by the day 
 For that very reason I'm committing this treason 
 So I'll be released from their chains 
 A pentagram lies in my chamber up high, then the candles blew out with a wind 
 From my incantations, his manifestation - Let the battle begin 
 Fall of the angels - They'll fall to the earth 
 Angels from heaven will fall to the earth 
 Fall of the angels - They'll fall to the earth 
 Angels from heaven will fall to the earth 
 The fall of Leviathan will save the world 
 Without his protection they have no choice but to return 
 My hopes to escape this without repercussion 
 Unfortunately is not coming true 
 I've given my life now you must stop him somehow 
 The rest is now up to you 
 One by one they fell from the sky, four of god's angels of rage 
 A clash of the titans with immortals fighting for control of the age 
 Fall of the angels - They'll fall to the earth 
 Angels from heaven will fall to the earth 
 Fall of the angels - They'll fall to the earth 
 Angels from heaven will fall to the earth 
 Angels from heaven falling to the earth 
 Falling to the earth 
 Falling to the earth 
 Falling to the earth
