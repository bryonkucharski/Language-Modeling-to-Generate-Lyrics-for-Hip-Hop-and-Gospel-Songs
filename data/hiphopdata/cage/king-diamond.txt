Tell you a tale of a soul that was lost, mind had gone over the edge 
 Painting a picture of musical madness and drilling it into your head 
 Deep down under the ground a thunderous evil was heard 
 Shocking and numbing for never before were spoken such blasphemous words 
 Don't look in his eyes they're black as the night 
 He'll make you see things in the shadows 
 Sinister siren of Satan himself 
 You'll never escape when he bellows 
 Now say his name! 
 King Diamond, what have you done, twisted the minds of us all 
 King Diamond, sinister son of the devil himself 
 King Diamond, what have you done, twisted the minds of us all 
 King Diamond, sinister son of the devil himself 
 Demons and witches will raise the undead, things will go bump in the night 
 His face is there painted a menacing head, he's bathing himself in the moonlight 
 Locked in the attic and burning the candle, he'll sing of the family ghost 
 Missy and grandma will echo his message : never should we break the oath 
 Don't look in his eyes they're black as the night 
 He'll make you see things in the shadows 
 Sinister siren of Satan himself 
 You'll never escape when he bellows 
 Now say his name! 
 King Diamond, what have you done, twisted the minds of us all 
 King Diamond, sinister son of the devil himself 
 King Diamond, what have you done, twisted the minds of us all 
 King Diamond, sinister son of the devil himself 
 Melissa... Belial... Abigail... Grandma... 
 Melissa... Belial... Abigail... The princess of hell... 
 His legend kept growing and quickly it spreads, his evil it flew on the wind 
 One day he will visit the land of the dead but don't think his haunting will end 
 Crossing the river he's there next to Charon, making his way cross the Styx 
 There on his forehead burning and branded his upside down crucifix 
 Don't look in his eyes they're black as the night 
 He'll make you see things in the shadows 
 Sinister siren of Satan himself 
 You'll never escape when he bellows 
 Now say his name! 
 King Diamond, what have you done, twisted the minds of us all 
 King Diamond, sinister son of the devil himself 
 King Diamond, what have you done, twisted the minds of us all 
 King Diamond, sinister son of the devil himself 
 King Diamond! 
 King Diamond! 
 King Diamond! 
 King Diamond!
