(Music: Eric Horton) 
 (Lyrics: Sean Peck) 
 I ran out the door you screamed "Don't leave me!, Don't leave me!" 
 I simply haven't got the time there's no more time 
 The world is caving in soon we'll be greiving greiving 
 Mother nature's showing us a sign don't you see the signs 
 Just how very shortly will you find you're... 
 Caught in a disaster your heart is beating faster 
 You know we'll never master nature's wicked ways 
 Earthquakes and titlewaves hurricane or a firey blaze 
 You know you've seen your final days 
 She's overcoming such a sickly feeling a feeling 
 Like a virus we all multiply we multiply 
 She defends herself with an upheaving upheaving 
 A ring of fire is nature's battle line a battle line 
 Just how very shortly will you find you're... 
 Caught in a disaster your heart is beating faster 
 You know we'll never master nature's wicked ways 
 Earthquakes and titlewaves hurricane or a firey blaze 
 You know you've seen your final days 
 There was not a word no one heard a sound 
 Then it came and tore the world in two 
 There was no escape she was all around, 
 How I pity you 
 Caught in a disaster your heart is beating faster 
 You know we'll never master nature's wicked ways 
 Earthquakes and titlewaves hurricane or a firey blaze 
 You know you've seen your final days 
 You're caught in a disaster, 
 You're caught in a disaster
