For what seemed like hours 
 I made my way through catacombs filled with waste 
 I knew just where to follow, its trail was glowing blue 
 I soon came to a doorway into the room I flew 
 They were shocked to see me, the four of them 
 And now my rampage would begin 
 They rushed me in a frenzy, I quickly drew my gun 
 I calmly squeezed the trigger, they now were missing one 
 I'll finish these four with some gunpowder blasts 
 I still need Allistar save him for last 
 Vengeance burns deep in me I need my fix 
 Mindlessly murdering sinister six 
 My lamp then found the next one, it broke with burning oil 
 It lit the room like the sun, I watched the bastard boil 
 The third one was half monster, it shrieked a sickening yell 
 I emptied the full chamber, and sent it straight to hell 
 Their golden-robed leader drew down on me fast 
 A bolt of blue lightning, I just dodged the blast 
 What sinister sorcery mind playing tricks 
 A weapon arcane from the sinister six 
 My arms was frozen in some kind of shock 
 The strange gun that he fired at me, it shattered rock 
 It was recharging, light circled the tip 
 It crackled and sparked like stars had been ripped 
 Before it could recharge again, I charged him with my blade 
 His blood filled the room from the hole it made 
 The room began collapsing, I grabbed that wicked gun 
 He said the beast had forged it - it was the only one 
 A beam from the ceiling crushed their leaders head 
 Before he was killed I heard just what he said 
 One final chamber yet still did exist 
 There you can finish the sinister six
