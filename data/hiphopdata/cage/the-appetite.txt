I gave them what they wanted - a fresh start 
 A new lease on life for that young man and his wife 
 I kept from them a secret, l did not tell the price 
 She was changing into something that wasn't nice 
 Annabelle was doing well, she was at her best 
 I could tell there was no more hell, she had passed the test 
 She was so alive now so was I 
 I watched her as she danced, marks on her back 
 They were small and black, hardly gave a glance 
 She really needs a lot now, I love her every night 
 Things are really getting hot now, her ferocious appetite 
 I can't seem to break her, she can go all night 
 So much heat between the sheets 
 It's so different than before 
 She moaned so loud, shed scream and shout 
 She acted like a whore 
 I tied her down I raised her gown, I laid her on the bed 
 With sexy eyes and creamy thighs, I did just what she said 
 Things are really getting rough now, she even likes to bite 
 Now every single night I feed her appetite 
 I can't seem to break her, she can go all night 
 You're not the same, you're not the same my love 
 What's happening to you? 
 I came home one night, she wasn't right 
 She was lying on the floor 
 Frail and weak her outlook bleak, just like it was before 
 I went back there to the Arab's lair, he said she needed more 
 A girl this time would do just fine 
 He said it as he closed the door 
 Will it ever be enough now, something isn't right 
 I'd do anything for love now, oh how I need her appetite 
 I have someone in mind, I'll go get her tonight 
 Feed her feed her feed her - the appetite 
 Faster and faster so goes the game, this is insane 
 Deeper and deeper drowning in guilt, up to the hilt 
 Weaker and weaker cracks in her voice, I have no choice 
 Sicker and sicker fading away, I must go today 
 Annabelle knew what we had to do 
 There was no going back in fact, she wanted it
