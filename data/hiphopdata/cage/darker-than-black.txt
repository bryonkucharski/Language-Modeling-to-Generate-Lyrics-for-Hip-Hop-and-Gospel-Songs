As we unlock the secrets to our universe. We have 
 Discovered that an all encompassing substance 
 Called Dark Matter threatens our very existence is

 And what small hope have we as black 
 Holes angrily devour our floating islands of light. 
 Theory becomes reality and another cross lines 
 The cosmic roadside engulfed by something... 
 Darker than black
