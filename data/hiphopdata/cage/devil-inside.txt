(Music: Eric Horton) 
 (Lyrics: Sean Peck) 
 You say you'd see me on my way 
 I look at you I guess I should have known 
 I'm watching for you my friend 
 If I see you once again I'll scream 
 A tragedy you've come undone 
 Got nowhere for you to run 
 You're crying out it's all in vain 
 Somethings never seem to change because... 
 He's got the Devil inside 
 Look at the Angel's eyes 
 Looking to sacrifice the sanctity of life 
 The sanctity of life 
 Your victims pile alarming rates 
 You've gone this far you don't hesitate 
 You know it's time to lay it down 
 Not too late to turn it around 
 You know... 
 He's got the Devil inside 
 Look at the Angel's eyes 
 Looking to sacrifice the sanctity of life 
 The sanctity of life 
 You're shifting points of view an influence alive 
 Something's coming over you changing you inside 
 End of the line has come at last 
 You knew it would but not this fast 
 You've gone to far you've crossed the line 
 Save yourself seek the divine 
 He's got The Devil inside 
 Look at the Angel's eyes 
 Looking to sacrifice the sanctity of life 
 He's got the Devil inside 
 Look at the Angel's eyes 
 Looking to sacrifice the sanctity of life 
 He's looking to sacrifice the sanctity of life 
 He's looking to sacrifice the sanctity of life
