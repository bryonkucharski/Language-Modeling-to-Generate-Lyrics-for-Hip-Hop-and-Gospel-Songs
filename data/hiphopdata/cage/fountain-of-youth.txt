(Music: CAGE) 
 (Lyrics: Sean Peck) 
 The clock is ticking for the sickly as they waste away 
 One day we're here the next we're gone 
 Our one desire to go higher past the golden age 
 Now that new day has finally dawned 
 Imagine life without any end 
 Now we can start a over again 
 Such wicked science affecting us all 
 Out of control! 
 Fountain of youth is here 
 The act of living unforgiving such a slow decay 
 We watch free-radicals erode 
 Stem-cell technology is overriding DNA 
 They reset genetic code 
 Imagine life without any end 
 Now we can start a over again 
 Such wicked science affecting us all 
 Out of control! 
 Fountain of youth is here 
 It's here! 
 Do you want to live forever? 
 We have what it takes 
 There is a price to pay 
 What is it? 
 Bio-ethicists insidious it is they say 
 Theoogians echo on man's new profanity is vanity is rules the day 
 Moral consciousness is gone 
 Imagine life without any end 
 Now we can start a over again 
 Such wicked science affecting us all 
 Out of control! 
 Fountain of youth is here 
 Feel the fountain flowing it's changing all our lives 
 We're losing who we are 
 If God created life 
 How can we destroy death? 
 We've pushed the line too far 
 The end is justified by the means that God is life and we should carry on 
 What will be crucified 
 What is the sacrifice? 
 The fountain seems so... Wrong
