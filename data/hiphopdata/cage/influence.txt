(Music: Dave Garcia) 
 (Lyrics: Sean Peck) 
 I come to you in many ways 
 I'll make sure my impression stays 
 See me I am the latest craze 
 You know my name is violence, 
 On you I have much influence 
 You have been changing ever since 
 Well I can rule your mind 
 Will you be left behind 
 Or will you ever find your hidden side 
 TV the games and headline news 
 Whichever channel that you choose 
 I'm everywhere I cannot lose 
 Your tolerance is getting higher, 
 So much more that you desire 
 Inside you there's a burning fire 
 Well I can rule your mind 
 Will you be left behind 
 Or will you ever find your hidden side 
 I know you're mine seen the signs hear me all the time 
 You don't really know how the fever grows from the seeds I sow 
 Well I can rule your mind 
 Will you be left behind 
 Or will you ever find your hidden side 
 I'm here and there's no turning back, 
 Are you really under attack 
 A brain of your own is what you lack 
 You need to decide your own fate 
 Does it effect your mental state, 
 No need for them to legislate 
 Well I can rule your mind 
 Will you be left behind 
 Or will you ever find your hidden side 
 I know you're mine seen the signs herar me all the time 
 You don't really know how the fever grows from the seeds I sow
