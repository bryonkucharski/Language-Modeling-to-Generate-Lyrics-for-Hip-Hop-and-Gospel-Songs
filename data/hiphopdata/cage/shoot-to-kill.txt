 (Lyrics: Sean Peck) 
 We ofter education 
 We're seeking fertile minds 
 Come and serve your nation 
 Shoot to kill your victim 
 Fire at will 
 Fire at will they say 
 Shoot to kill 
 It's a killing system 
 Blood will spill 
 You travel Such great distances as diplomats deploy 
 And in many instances your ordered to destroy 
 Shoot to kill your victim 
 Fire at will 
 Fire at will they say 
 Shoot to kill 
 It's a killing system 
 Blood will spill 
 You'll sacrifice your life 
 A germ a bomb or just a knife 
 You'll battle without fear 
 Dark intentions led you here 
 Take the land by force 
 Objectives just aren't clear of course 
 They never are in war 
 A constant ROAR 
 Shoot to kill 
 Fire at will 
 Shoot to kill 
 Blood will spill 
 They've programmed your mind so you won't disobey 
 They tell you it's safe but make you lead the way 
 Political Idiots blocking your goal 
 Just push a botton and sieze all control 
 Shoot to kill your victim 
 Fire at will 
 Fire at will they say 
 Shoot to kill 
 It's a killing system 
 Blood will spill
