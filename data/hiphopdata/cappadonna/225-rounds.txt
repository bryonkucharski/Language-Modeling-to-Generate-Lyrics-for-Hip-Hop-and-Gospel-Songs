At 3:47, more than one hundred and fifty rounds of ammunition 
 Were fired into your apartment 
 Which was about two hundred yards away 
 A few moments later, 
 Another fifty to seventy five rounds 
 Were fired in the street 
 And you're gonna stand here 
 And tell me you didn't see a god damn thing? 
 I live life lavish, and my chain is carats 
 The last flame on the train to Paris 
 Used to be lame, then I changed to maverick 
 So many clothes, can't name the fabrics 
 Dynamics, I want the fame 
 And my name engraved in granites 
 This the lane, and I came to grab it 
 Yeah, you moving sideways, change your habits 
 Yeah, used to rock minks, then I changed to rabbit 
 From out the garbage, I came from Abbott's 
 Used to be righteous, then changed to savage 
 Bang my record like Bangkok Dangerous 
 36 Chamber Fists, trianglist 
 Watch me mangle this, star spangle this 
 Rock cowboy wrangle it, create mega hits 
 I'm from the grain, game at my finger tips 
 Yeah, Killah Hill lay it down 
 Killa Beez on the swarm 
 Nigga 
 Aiyo, I plow down tracks like I'm out for revenge 
 Fuck it, it seems like the drama never ends 
 Be in the projects, like I never left out 
 Might be on odds goods, see a nigga stressed out 
 I can't take it, seems like my hood is cursed 
 Bad niggas, I thought that the good was first 
 My old hawk she march with a foul parade 
 Don't learn shit, till another child is sprayed 
 I'm out here, fuck it, like I live on Targhee 
 And Rico, keep a low cut like laundry 
 I don't give a fuck, y'all made me bitter 
 I'mma whip your kids out like a babysitter 
 I'm a grown man, but I'm young in the mindstate 
 Live in every borough but New York my tri state 
 Test me, you nothing but a bitch on the tour bus 
 Pour piss on you, leave you stuck with four months 
 My head fucked up, I'm off my clean streak 
 Don't make me pick the nines up, I come from mean streets 
 My unit snitched on me, ratted me out 
 They all ganged up on me, try to take my mouth 
 However the cause, I'mma chill and get bent 
 That cut from dirty cloth who cut from cement 
 Original Tazeen got the crazy glow 
 Them devils try to jump me, I'm crazy though 
 Absolut Vodka rap, crushing that goose 
 O.G. all day, like I be on the deuce 
 Pop off with it, get your army in order 
 Staten Africa, Islam, across that water 
 Yeah, what you talking about, nigga? 
 Word up, you think it can't happen? 
 Nigga, I smack all y'all niggas 
 This Big Don from the group-iz 
 Nigga I be where the stoupe is 
 Yeah, told 'em, have gun will travel 
 Blowing herb metals, black son still gravel 
 Bronzeman, oblong javelins in my cabinet 
 Detroit submit seeds, salutation from the missile plant 
 Quick to the hollow point, it ain't no olive branch 
 My low cal, four oh cal in the cardigan 
 Tempted by Satan, put a bullet in his diaphragm 
 Walk around black clouds and quiet violins 
 Italian fire blends, poet and violent pens 
 Illest ill, scotch deal, plots and iron winds 
 Up hill near the ghetto spill, the sirens sing 
 Street dreams, black seed and the inspired kings 
 From fire water veins, still rain mystery 
 And chains due to my roots, no doubt in the ring 
 On the road to riches and diamond speech 
 I might turn a bag of white sand into mountain peaks 
 Yo, I don't text to sent messages 
 My testosterone stimulate her estrogen 
 Whether black, Caucasian or the Mexican 
 Asians, she get the message and she coming back for sex again 
 Organic drugs, my natural persuasion 
 You under the influence of 36 invasion 
 Spider-Man amazing, but I'm darker than Parker 
 Skin got abrasions from Maria and Tasha 
 Sliding down a street pole, pull up to your party 
 Stimulated with a jeep full of cherry gap honeys and bottles of Vodka 
 Plus the weed bowls, here we go 
 Meditating, never jealous, over zealous 
 Wu-Tang Clan's my fellowship, fans massive acapellas 
 Of our lyrics, would be with tracks embellishes 
 The idea clearer that Wu-Tang Forever 
 This, way of life is art, rhymes and cleverness 
 Enjoying by God, no man could sever this 
 I complete jobs, free and effortless 
 Use Tiger Crane, Snake Style plus the Leopard Fist
