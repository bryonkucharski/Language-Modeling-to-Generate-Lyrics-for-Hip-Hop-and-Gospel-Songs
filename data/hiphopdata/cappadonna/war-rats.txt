(Feat. Neonek) 
 Less seen and less heard, It's the pillage 
 Live where we die for trade, orphans of the industry, rise up against 
 Pretense, DJ's of segregation come together plottin' on the Nation 
 Cats got the puff powder dance 
 Underground economics, take a chance at the crackpot 
 Speak at the ones on top 
 At the gay bar your best rap star caught not keepin' it real 
 What's the deal wit' y'all wanna be MC's when Ghost hit you 
 The struggle is official with this 
 Chill 'cause we don't mix wit' y'all uncle Tomers 
 We rock those real black leather bombers 
 For real, Park Hill not Beverly Hills 
 Y'all better be still 
 My brains come out of my ball pen for my origin 
 I put the work in, any predictament 
 In fact it don't matter to me 
 The rap Oprah Winfrey with less currency 
 But rock beautifully, no security with me 
 Hard times and prophecy 
 One idea, two children and three for virginity 
 Pure energy whenever you confront me 
 I'ma take yours, star wars. 
 Star Wars, storm troopers, evil rulers 
 New manuevers, Black German Luger laser beam 
 The tables turned now, enter Shaolin where it's cold now 
 Let the Teck blow now 
 More Jungle nails, Parkhillbillies pour gas on Phillies 
 Blocks where the Babies pick locks 
 And Women make love to other Women 
 It's the pillage, your Mother's Sons 
 No more cold war, it be the poor ones 
 No radio play, from the hallway to the doorway 
 They banned us, cease to understand us 
 Rap criminals segregated, player hated 
 Underrated, project recipients 
 Cappadonna, bag with the marijuana 
 I'm a late-comer, I spread love last Summer 
 Photographs with the Hummer 
 A young dumber, bound to get dumber 
 I speak the real CB, pillage monopoly 
 Talk a XYZ, ain't nothin' like WB 
 O.T.F., a bag of Uno Sixty 
 I love how the weed get me 
 See me whole style tricky 
 Gats under the table, the tables turn now 
 Life is too short and too foul 
 Fake Brothers will get exiled 
 Staten Island style, chicka-Pow! 
 I drop paragraphs of information 
 My mind starts racin' 
 I'm in the lot dancin' with the hard-headed 
 I start to attack on every track when I react 
 Dancehall style, ain't nothin' nice 
 I came to regulate, Cappachino the great 
 Comin' from all sorts of angles 
 I close in, my team be the chosen 
 Authorized like a hat tucked in 
 You get sucked in, catch a repurcussion and crushed in 
 Paralyzed, open your eyes, it's us again 
 O.T.F. hit you like the blow of death 
 Pulled while you was 'sleep 
 With or without the gold teeth 
 Crunch and lounge, Q guardin' the door 
 It's like Comstock, we in the Belly similar to clock 
 Boys to Men buildin', in the street 
 Oatmeal and Cream of Wheat 
 Thugs smoke leek, it's like the penile in the ghetto 
 Palmetto, chocolate trees, crying Babies 
 Rabies to the ringworm, take a turn and get burned 
 Tryin' to be this, realness 
 Shaolin barracks is very high tempered 
 Sensed it in the water sorrounded by the fairy boats 
 Hallways with pissy cut throats 
 We forever live, gotta protect the orphanage 
 The beast men, learn to fight back with the poilcemen 
 Star Wars... Star Wars.
