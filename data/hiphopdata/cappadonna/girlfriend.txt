Verse One: Cappadonna 
 Girlfriend, what you did was wrong 
 Baby my love is still strong 
 On some King Kong ding-dong 
 Never celebate, never souflan 
 Poppi kin, poppi wardrobe king 
 Suck her G-spot, and you know she so hot 
 She said she love me a lot 
 Remedy, she told me she drop 
 Fuck her so hard, all outdoors 
 Pussy is mines and plus yours 
 Didn't mean to turnin' 'em out, turnin' 'em on 
 Stetched out in front the next girl house 
 BB dick out, Remedy, slash Cappadon' 
 Slash pardon me for turnin' you on 
 Turnin' you on 
 Chorus: Cappadonna 
 Girlfriend 
 BB conduct, BB conduct, BB conduct 
 Didn't mean to turn you on 
 BB conduct, BB conduct, BB conduct 
 Verse Two: Remedy 
 Check that yo, fuck what he thinks 
 You know the pussy bleeds and stinks 
 Buy ya tranked out, blanked out, all crazy in pink 
 I seen the pussy kill the best of men and take down kings 
 Fuck material things, fuck ya phat diamonds rings 
 Men do lifetime bids for this, 2 lips hit the clitoris 
 Inconspicous, hit with Syphilis, ridiculous 
 One gash, came between the man and the stash 
 Half his cash, sucker for love ass 
 Souflan, no doubt, was never in the plan 
 Ball-and-chain, pussywhipped man can't understand 
 It's like the Cappadon said 
 MCF means you thinkin' with ya head 
 If you thinkin' with ya dick son, ya might get sick 
 'Cause when it comes to the piece son, ain't shit for free 
 Either pay for every piece of it or start a family 
 Now all rise and eyes on the prize of this song 
 And if I did I never meant the girl to turn you on 
 Verse Three: Cappadonna 
 Sellin ya gold, sellin ya soul 
 You crossed out, and crossed over 
 Gold digga and Hilfiger, booster and strippa 
 Flip on a nigga too quicka 
 Projects, is what I deal wit 
 Cold-hearted chicks catch on fast 
 Twist they ass, take more cash, and more crack 
 Tishy on the block, like bitches never do that 
 I protect females that fuck me on the first night 
 Bitin my spray nozzel, see Goines 
 Turnin' y'all ladies, off and on, popcorn 
 Freddy Kruger, thoughts of how I'm gon' do ya 
 Ya mind all screwed up, BB conduct 
 All of y'all girls are outta luck 
 Takin' too long, givin' ya shit up 
 BB conduct, BB conduct, BB conduct, BB conduct
