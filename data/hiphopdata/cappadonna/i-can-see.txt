(Intro: Cappadonna, (Tekitha)) 
 {What's up? Where the music at?} 
 'Donna and Tekitha (oh... oh) 
 Big boys hold they weight and one shotty 
 (No... no...) Killa-professionals, word 
 Pirates (Oh...) Murder on TV or on the CD 
 Bless me, Killa Bees, RZA paint 
 Yo, I could see, I could see 
 (Chorus x2: Tekitha) 
 I can see clear like a vision 
 No mystery to realize 
 The decision, no, no, no, no 
 Is no longer in me... 
 (Cappadonna) 
 Yo, I could see, yo, I could see like owls in the night 
 Thieves' blindness no longer exist, uplift 
 Behold the life of a chemist, used to be a menace 
 But Don-Don never could form, my mind's like Anaconda 
 Never sore, forever see through over the trees 
 Eyes like a bird, Jay Bird, best seen and best heard 
 W.T.C. never sold out for no body (no longer in me...) 
 (Tekitha) 
 Tryin' to rush them, swing around me 
 Good an author, lies you told me 
 Now I can, now I can see... 
 (W.T.C., the best in the facility) 
 Never raise at harmony 
 Now I know I must simply release 
 That I did amd what's right 
 Changed my mind... 
 And recoginzed that only I can see me... 
 And you can't, can't deny it 
 That the things you've done effected me... 
 Oh... I can see 
 (Cappadonna) 
 Knowledge come first, regardless of the hardest 
 Some get trapped, some couldn't adapt 
 When the Wu-Tang Pillage came back, it's like life 
 Shed life, from a dart came a whole world 
 Clear like a vision, I'm inside of a pearl 
 With my whole heritage, we tight like panthers 
 Take chances and be the all eye seein 
 Donna and Tekitha, anti-easter 
 We 3 piece suit and tie, asiatic 
 See through the bullshit, come with the static 
 (Tekitha) 
 I can see... clearly... yeah... 
 My eyes have been opened to you now 
 Hey... hey (I could see you clear like a vision) 
 Hey... hey... still see clearly 
 I can see your ways and actions 
 You've shown me, I can see, I see 
 Your ways and actions, you've shown me 
 Oh... I can see 
 (Chorus to fade)
