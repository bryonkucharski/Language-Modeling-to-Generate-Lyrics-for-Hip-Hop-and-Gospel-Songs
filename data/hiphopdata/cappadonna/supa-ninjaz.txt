(Repeating in background: "rock, the body body -- rock the body body" 
 (U-God) 
 Dino the dart specialist 
 Knahmean? 
 Golden Arms, yo 
 Meth-Tical, John John do your thing thing 
 What? Check it 
 The all eye seein, heavenly divine 
 The truth brings out, the temper in my spine 
 A Hill sound again, feelin' symptoms that bit me 
 I feel for you victims, with everything up in me (uh-huh) 
 A head ringa, stuffed in sidewalls of frenzy 
 Back the fuck up, 'cause I'm stimmi off the Remi 
 A semi bloodshot eye, donkey dick of nuts 
 Every cut, I split and try and felt the guts (what?) 
 Nigga what, earthquakin speech, woofer hissin 
 The razor faced victims, WHEW, that's what kissed em 
 Appropriate precaution, surroundin, certain it curtains 
 I'm dumbfounded, I'm poundin, the pavement 
 For mental enslavement, I'm cravin, a misbehavin savior 
 America the grave for gun wavers (what?) 
 The wave runners, what the blood seed again 
 Make you wonder, about the thunder underneath the skin (hmm) 
 The sapphire rhymes slap fire out your minds 
 With right timin, bite with vampire rhymes 
 (Method Man) 
 Hmm, eye spy, with my crooked eye 
 Full metal street soldiers, born to die 
 Put 'em up yeah fuck yeah, when it's Hammertime 
 Niggaz can't be touched here, the true and livin' 
 Night vision unseen, like Jean 
 When I hack men The Unforgiven, left in prison 
 In the Wu-Tang dirty dungeon, now you succumbin 
 To my twelve part dirty dozens, flabbergasted 
 By tracks that be Tru Mastered, opposites attract 
 Beef plus they ass backwards, stick yourself 
 Till I'm felt, this ass whoopin, is bein dealt 
 Like hot beans-and-butter nigga, I got the belt 
 What the deal huh? Swing low, sweet chariot 
 I walk the Underground Railroad, with Harriett 
 Just a slave to the rhythm - victims I'm like alien 
 About to put that shit up in em, I Can't Live 
 Without My Radio, a 100 Miles and Runnin' 
 T2 Judgment comin', nobody's safe 
 When I reminisce about Case, still hit the staircase 
 When the coppers give chase, I give 'em finger 
 The only hip-hop singer, to tell America 
 To kiss his Killer Bee stinger, nothin' can save ya 
 From this major misbehavior, heavy hands 
 Layin corners in the elevator, guard your grill 
 (Cappadonna) 
 I speculate, get my darts straight, don't exaggerate 
 Dictate, do it with the Papermate, set the plate 
 Set the bait, checkmate, fuckin' with cha mental state 
 Double take, meditate, earthquake, VGL contemplate 
 Big boys integrate; catch you at the sess skate 
 Army tank, high rank, got the bank 
 Got the shank talk the talk walk the walk from New York 
 To Up North to downstate to L.A., to all day 
 To cliches to instant replays, to all the DJ's 
 To BJ's in the PJ's, equality days 
 With money like legs I plant eggs, Pele roundhead 
 The dog bred, snakes runnin' from red, catch dead 
 Raekwon is on, take your uniform, we perform 
 Shit like gangs in Now Born, check for new Don 
 Fuck a Yukon, you been warned, we the realest 
 We never were conned, duffed out and knowledge born 
 ("Rock, the body body - rock the body body") - repeat till fade
