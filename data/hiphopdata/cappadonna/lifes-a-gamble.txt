Aiyo, when we writing, yo, shit is like the vice laws 
 Fighting everybody wet, Lex dog, vibe on biting necks 
 There goes the new hammer, microwave blamp, from the stove to the roads 
 Down in New Hampshire, brolic size, wallet guys 
 Frame broiled shotties, with the Ducati's, my pockets is set 
 Now watch what you rep, I've been buying niggas heads 
 Wall crawler, Captain Caveman, in the hall scrawling 
 Money is stacked up, better than yours 
 Do with the rappers, clap niggas, slap 'em, and car jack 'em 
 Everything niggas is serving, is crack, what, preferably Kellogg's 
 You just a goldmine, yup, cereal bowls of heroin 
 Yup, the Don Baron, it's worth hundreds, say something 
 Niggas fronting while we doubling, pump 'em 
 And lay 'em right in front of the steps 
 The new Mark Cuban, Mavericks, we moving like Arabics 
 Faces is wrapped, crosses on like Catholics 
 Blend to the music, it's all in the game 
 Riding through life in this fast lane, fast change 
 Y'all deal when the lights green, but when that light change 
 You gotta make a slight change, use your wipers cause it might rain 
 Life's a gamble like a dice game 
 Aiyo, I'm when I'm writing I be thinking like Donald Goines 
 Posted up on the strip, fishing like bitches hoeing 
 Blowing like Jesse Owens, run laps around these tracks 
 And I stay up in the hood like, weed and cracks 
 Damn right, I still pack the strap, duck if I whip it out 
 But if I whip it out, you're people will be picking out 
 A coffin and a tombstone, park 'em in the graveyard 
 Prayers and a leap of faith, probably couldn't save y'all 
 That's the path of bravehearts, clap you in the hallway 
 Turn two o's that soft, into three the hard way 
 Move the diesel all day, shut it down in night time 
 That's when the undercovers buy, in night time 
 Move to the forefront, Ratch' had the store front 
 First I had two goals, now I got more front 
 Bitch I been G'd up, put a O in front of that 
 Keep them bitches ski'd up, blowing off each other's back 
 Heavy white ice, gold ornaments, hustle and life 
 Hustle and light, good with the pill 
 Be at all the tournaments, stroll in the beach 
 Out in Luv Allah, we love all of y'all 
 Killah Hill, Staten Africa, rap massacre 
 Make a phone call, have niggas get at cha 
 Rat ya, two double nines in the back of the Acura, it's a Don thing 
 Don King, Don bitches under the ring 
 We don't ever sing, raps get cut in the bing 
 Posse up, see me the Beemer or Benz truck 
 Reppin' that W, it's trouble for you 
 Knife through ya bubble goose, veterans loose, thirty nine on the deuce 
 Pick it up, stick it up, niggas is thinking to bust 
 Breaking these states for they cake, you know what it do 
 What's up, Goldie? Niggas wanna march, hanging with Jody 
 Street Flavor click, roll thicker than shit 
 We the upmost, faggot niggas get bitched 
 Smacked with the toast, crackin' the line in the coke 
 Niggas'll cutthroat, cutthroat, inferred on top of the scope 
 Crack in the dial, mixed with soap, Killah Island
