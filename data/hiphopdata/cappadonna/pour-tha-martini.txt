Clarks is lighty scuffed, need a new pair 
 Jacob Javits Center, Wu and Snoop there 
 D-Block pull up, olive green drops 
 The interior suede, 'cause that's boss crock 
 Air fresheners hang, the joint is sold out 
 To capacity, this young bitch keep asking me 
 "Can I suck your dick?", "Not now, shorty" 
 "Maybe after the show, just hold fast for me" 
 Ferocious bangles, birds on both arms 
 I'm jew-eled out like a box of Lucky Charms 
 On stage, two treadmills, a pull-up bar 
 Involved with the lights to give it that red feel 
 Feeling like Bruce Wayne, making up for never making the prom 
 Ma, you chilling? The belt glow in the dark 
 Where my aunt stays, batteries gone 
 That's when I pull a forty out for Ason 
 Wu-Block, I'm from a gun play habitat 
 Let me run into Nicki, I'm smashing that 
 What you know about the ratchet in your mother mouth 
 Killah banging the neck, with two rubbers out 
 Sheek and Ghost Deini, aiyo, Cap, pour that bitch a martini 
 Loosen her up, fuck it, pour Goose in her cup 
 Tell her chill, 'cause the Gods is here 
 Big money in this place, I'm balling when I'm leaving out of Chase 
 Red diamonds on a Freddy Kruger face 
 I don't get pat down, you know what's on the waist 
 I don't mean jazz when I say I count base 
 Fly Louis sneakers, Purple Tape coming out the speakers 
 Bumped into my high school teachers 
 They said I wouldn't be nothing, sitting on the bleachers 
 Now I'm sitting in the Phantom, trynna figure out the features 
 I'm a big fish now, I watch for the leeches 
 Wu-Block, I'm from a gun play habitat 
 Let me run into Nicki, I'm smashing that 
 What you know about the ratchet in your mother mouth 
 Killah banging the neck, with two rubbers out 
 Aiyo, I jump on stage with my dick in my hand 
 I'm a Park Hill nigga, straight from Shaolin 
 New York is the borough where I pump my rocks at 
 Bitch ass niggas where I dump my glocks at 
 I don't have to get dip, I'm known and flossy 
 I'm known everywhere like Remedy Rossy 
 Never say shit, I'm hard and cocky 
 Too hot for these tracks, wash this summer 
 Go hard for the hood from Arlington to Sumner 
 Yeah, nigga, what, I'm just one of us 
 For all my jail niggas, that feel wondrous 
 Fuck a fat bitch, with a thunder butt 
 Mad groupie love, too caliente 
 Mahogany, polly with Sin Jay 
 My nigga Ghost Rider, King Sheek Louch 
 I'm in the fly spotlight with that Papoose 
 Wu-Block, I'm from a gun play habitat 
 Let me run into Nicki, I'm smashing that 
 What you know about the ratchet in your mother mouth 
 Killah banging the neck, with two rubbers out
