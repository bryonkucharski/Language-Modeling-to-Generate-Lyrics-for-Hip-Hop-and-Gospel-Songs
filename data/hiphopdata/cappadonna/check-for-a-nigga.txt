 If you in Maryland, check for a nigga 
 If you in Virginia, check for a nigga 
 If you in Toronto, check for nigga 
 Check for a nigga, check for a nigga 
 You see me Uptown, yo you see me Uptown last night 
 With my new Nike's, satellite gold as hell 
 I stroll well, I protect with the most 
 Respected mic check, cassette full of life 
 High technology, Gortek intellect 
 Good for a million, one dart project 
 Kid I nurse this rap shit, textbook monitor 
 Merge just like traffic, dick deserve an encore 
 One of a kind, Pro-Line hydro head 
 Hold a verse like a Wisdom, smack tracks on her ass 
 Quick competition, got you in a smash 
 Diamond thoughts, bite down on your ear 
 I fear none, Dolemite strike three time 
 Award mic fuck crazy vagina 
 Born first to rock fifty, S.I. New York City 
 Slang Nitty, check for me badly 
 Manditory for me to keep fuckin' y'all head up 
 The one man news team fast like a photographer 
 Check for a nigga, check for a nigga, check for a nigga 
 If you in D.C., check for a nigga 
 If you in Virginia, check for a nigga 
 If you in Ohio, check for a nigga 
 If you in Toronto, check for a nigga, check for a nigga 
 Straight from the heritage, public announcers 
 Ounces of darts, he fucked you over 
 I stole ya heart, so just in case 
 You forgot about the face, flash that camera 
 At the all-time great, slight paranoid 
 Fuck toys consistent, fluent slang pediment 
 It's the magnificent, first album 
 Hot tracks on the sipper, low flame deliver 
 Defense like a Giant, it's the Son of Pslam giver 
 Masterpiece in the making, Asian 
 African Egyptian Jamaican 
 Swordplay from the deep isolation, whattup cousin? 
 Have a drink on the house, I blow mics out 
 This man is on fire, fully developed 
 Dance with the organizer, chance me 
 Tap into my Wu pedigree, numba three chamber 
 Second in the cut, it's the Black Lone Ranger 
 Cat in the Hat, fresh clothes on the hanger 
 The Last Man Standing with the vest and the banger 
 Desperate to delegate, peep me on the Magnavox 
 Channel Fox, telecommunicate 
 Match money like socks, summertime style 
 Thunderstorm, vocabulary anonymous 
 Kid extra Caligula, poetry in particular 
 Check for a nigga, check for a nigga, check for a nigga 
 If you in Virginia, check for a nigga 
 If you in Manhattan, check for a nigga 
 If you in D.C., check for a nigga 
 If you in Georgia, check for a nigga 
 Check for a nigga, check for a nigga, check for a nigga 
 Outfits forever 
 New Cappadonna, blue is my quaintness 
 I'm a maintenance in this rap shit, politics 
 Spit the graphic mix it up nice spent 
 Twist me in the city, elegance walk 
 My style Don Hard Juan, Passenger 57 
 In Jackson 10, A Soldier and a Gentleman 
 Calm and hyper, deadly spokesperson 
 Smooth like a tiger, inquiring minds 
 Design arts and crafts, used to play the field 
 On the rap, drafted the devil 
 Bass and treble, worldwide baritone 
 Judge wise on the throne, wild like sober lyrics 
 Splash out my dome, uncontrollable 
 Staten Island untold feel it across the globe 
 I expand, Cappa the man, head low 
 Eyes red like a Wu suit, do it right Sixty 
 My stee' mary alley, follow my lead 
 Not my language it's dangerous, pitbull fightin 
 A war, hardcore C-4 with the words kid 
 Better branches, turn your head twice 
 One life, still gettin' it right, then yo 
 Check for a nigga, check for a nigga, check for a nigga, check for a nigga 
 If you in Brooklyn check for a nigga 
 If you in Manhattan check for a nigga 
 If you in Queens, check for a nigga 
 If you in the Bronx then check for a nigga 
 Check for a nigga, check for a nigga 
 Check for a nigga 
 If you in the Woods, check for a nigga 
 Check for a nigga 
 If you in the Garbage, check for a nigga 
 Check for a nigga
