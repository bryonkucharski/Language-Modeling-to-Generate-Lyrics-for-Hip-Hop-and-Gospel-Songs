I, am, hustle and flow 
 I do whatever I do to get that dough 
 Used to sell tour raps at the 1-6-Oh 
 Got caught with the raps up under my coat 
 Feds locked me up, on the Staten Island Ferry Boat 
 Alot of niggas used to stuff they raps with soap 
 Yo, I hustle all the time like I'm pushing the dope 
 Got rap like an E pill, rap ecstasy 
 Yo, the rap shit, kinda like sex to me 
 When I bust one nut on the M-I-C 
 Hustle for the neck nut, never hustle for free 
 Yo, I flow with the hustle when I spit my G 
 Aiyo, I, am, hustle and flow 
 I'm a hustler, hustle mad rap with GZA 
 We shoot you with that shit, that make you shiver 
 Fiends line up, flows that attack the liver 
 Suffocating in your vein like dirt in the river 
 Nigga taught Cap rap, that broke the cow's back 
 You high all night like where those dudes at? 
 Narco's on our tail, running fast in the building trynna block our sale 
 We got raps coming out our ass 
 Hustle and flow, nigga, rap in a stash 
 Bring those bottles back, get that cash 
 Rap re-up, two get a nigga three up 
 Hustle all night, baseheads still be up 
 Staten Africa, niggas catch malaria 
 Raps stuffed in my sock, watch out nigga 
 Yeah, he's the carrier 
 I, am, hustle and flow 
 I do whatever I do to get that dough 
 I, am, hustle and flow 
 I do whatever I do to get that dough 
 Sell rap under the trees, in the Congo 
 Some Puerto Rican stashed rap in the bongo 
 Don Kaneesh, sell raps, take the risk 
 I got lawyer, track down all my shit 
 So just in case you wanna cop more heavy 
 None of y'all rappers don't have to worry 
 'Cause I'm good with the hustle and my flows is crack 
 Yeah, I'm talking bout rap, jeans, hoodies and Nikes 
 I see the pigs coming when they flash the lights 
 Now get dough, I am hustle and flow 
 I, am, hustle and flow 
 Aiyo, hustle everywhere, hustle rap like ki's 
 Anywhere I hustle my rap, I watch for D's 
 Dickhead niggas try to bite my steeze 
 Stop trying to sell your raps around my blocks 
 Yo, your shit sound garbage and you making it hot 
 You ain't hip hop, nigga, y'all rap is pop 
 Yo, my flow so good, I might get me a spot 
 Niggas don't want me to come up, the hustle is lethal 
 I sell it to the kids, I love the people 
 My shit sound crack like cooked up blow 
 I told y'all, I am hustle and flow 
 I, am, hustle and flow 
 I, am, hustle and flow 
 Hustle my raps, kid, everywhere I go 
 I, am, hustle and flow 
 Do whatever I do, to get that dough, holla
