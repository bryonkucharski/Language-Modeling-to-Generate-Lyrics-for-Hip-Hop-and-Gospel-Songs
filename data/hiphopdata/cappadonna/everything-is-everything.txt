(Cappadonna) 
 All in the club like what? Rugged dressed up 
 Hair messed up, gold on my neck 
 Don't sweat y'all show respect Poppa on the set 
 Death threat, I come a long stretch you can bet 
 Love is love, for real for real 
 Feel what you feel Park Hill 1-0-3-0-4 
 Rock caps till you can't take no more, it's war 
 Prepare for darts, martial arts 
 Let me shine keep me and mine, Son of Song 
 Took too long, back throwin' darts, without remorse 
 Dart holocaust, slang boss 
 Remain top hip-hop, drop you to your knees for these 
 Big CD's, you heard it through the grapevine 
 Killer Beez 
 Chorus: Rhyme Recca 
 Everything is everything, reality 
 I keep my mind on everything, cause everything 
 Ain't always everything, and everything 
 That you see ain't reality, they just illusions 
 (Cappadonna) 
 Face to face I break bread every time 
 In the world I hold mine, play it 
 Now check it, see if you can comprehend 
 These crossover rappers that lost they origin 
 Run from the Wu this time it's more trouble 
 I'm comin' for the wreck so y'all could never bubble 
 Never concerned about rabbits, after my cabbage 
 Cherryheads, and parrots 
 Won't live in the barracks, we Don Hoe 
 Buckwild with the flow, how we do 
 Timbo's and full boot, vocabulary pitfall 
 Fuck all, more clothes than the mall 
 Let's brawl 
 Wu-Tang broke radio laws, the opposite of mines 
 Is yours, from sea shores to bankrupt 
 I conduct, erupt like Holyfield 
 Third seal, third chamber's from the hood 
 Branch out, and every time you see Don 
 I'm up to no good... motherfucker 
 Splash that 
 (Cappadonna) 
 I'm all alone, I feel trouble in the street 
 City heats, ghetto beefs, trick or treat 
 Call Chief, mad beef with MC's 
 Entity, Killer Beez one machine 
 Intervene, on scene self esteem 
 We gleam at night, it seems like 
 We too hype, hop y'all like checkers 
 Projectors, we break laws, get yours 
 We break jaws reunite, we upright 
 It's all right, out of sight, out of mind 
 It take time I develop, heads swell up 
 Shut the hell up, add on, you been warned 
 Mics get torn in half, I drop math 
 Don't laugh, a bloodbath with this here 
 Rap Shakespeare, beware, Donna-mite 
 Brown skin with the satellite, I represent 
 Buckwild and Street Life like two cent 
 For real, for real 
 Love is love, for real, for real *overlaps chorus* 
 (Kung-Fu movie sample) 
 The other killers, have already shown up 
 Now it'll be your turn, to die too
