Intro/Chorus: Blue Raspberry 
 You left me here, alone, with a shine 
 Our hearts were strong, but I couldn't find 
 My world alone, how could I break my home 
 Still I doubted you, and still your strength 
 Enchanted me, you was the father to my child 
 And a man to me, now I'm sung of strong hearts 
 Run free, run free, young hearts 
 Young hearts, run free 
 Run free, young hearts 
 (Cappadonna) 
 Girlfriend, what you did was wrong 
 Even though the love was strong, you moved on 
 Never had faith in the Don, you was safe 
 With the Don, and then you walked out 
 A broken house, a broken heart 
 Cry for my dart, we had a plan 
 We was woman and man, the hourglass 
 Held the sand, I held you like contraband 
 But you didn't understand when the four devils 
 Came inside of your life that night 
 We argued and fight, you knew it wasn't right 
 Fucked up our life, my thoughts come stronger 
 Every ounce, it's not my fault 
 That you wanted to bounce, now you tellin' me 
 That you cleaned up your act, beep me every time 
 But I never call back, that's how I felt 
 When you was makin' me crack 
 Me leave wifey for you?? 
 I'm crying 
 I'm crying 
 (Blue Raspberry) 
 Young hearts, run free 
 Run free, young hearts 
 Young hearts, run free...
