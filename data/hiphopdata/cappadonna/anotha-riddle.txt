Chorus: U-God 
 Hysterical lyrical launch, anotha riddle 
 A miracle little by little, fits right up the middle 
 (Cappadonna) 
 Let us milk this cow, the best way we know how 
 Park Hill projects, chicka-POW 
 One culture, return of the track slasher 
 Double doser, Cappadonna broadcaster 
 Strivin for perfection, the only way I got 
 My life back was through investin, devotion 
 Movin my soul toward the skit, vocabulary 
 Comin' out my ass like shit, to feed my babies 
 I gotta fight y'all MC's, this money 
 Be gettin' me high just like trees in these tracks 
 I milk for all my childhood, make me feel good 
 So I keep on writin meditatin in the ghetto 
 Makin' love waitin for lost minds to settle 
 Then I speak out, because we all need the guidance 
 Deep down inside is where you could define science 
 My mother told me, when I was so stressed out 
 "All you gotta do is just put your best out" 
 And I did it 
 (Cappadonna) 
 Yo, new Cappadonna is about to exhale kid 
 Hold all the phone calls, stop all the mail 
 Cappadonna raise hell, speak and I broke the shells 
 Seen brothers that fell when I slipped 
 I had my alibi tight that night, up in the Hill chillin' 
 Y'all'll get shot, move away things are too hot 
 Look at my spot now, friends are exiled from close distance 
 I broke resistance, every time I step up, I rip reps up 
 Ku Klux, my words swing around like numchucks 
 This ain't for big bucks, never can quit this rap shit 
 It feeds my seeds, I can barely breathe 
 But y'all cats better believe keep off, your darts are soft 
 While I throw these missiles, at your skin tissue 
 You can't escape I absorb, gigantic crowds all aboard 
 Watch out for city fraud, my darts slam like doors 
 Makin' it hard for you to get yours, selfish
