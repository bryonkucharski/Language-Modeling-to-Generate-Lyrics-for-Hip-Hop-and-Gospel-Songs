(Shyheim) 
 The precinct is crooked, my man got grabbed up 
 Had cracks on him worth about a bullet 
 They just took it, asked him questions like, "Where's the guns?" 
 They tried to cheat him to tell them where was Un 
 The God ten deep in a red fifteen passenger 
 Guns out when they jumped out, pointed at us 
 Here comes, what they call a procedure 
 Slammin' us against a gate, cuffin us before they beat us 
 (Channel Live) 
 It's like they can't trust us, they wanna bust us 
 And crush us, they sayin' f' us, there's no peace, no just-us 
 They claim to protect us, they serve and they wreck us 
 Never respect us, arrest us and always stress us 
 To see the Devil die is my purpose of to live up 
 Self-determinance is the must, I practice Kool G jog-a-leos 
 Free your mind and yo *bitch* is sure to follow 
 And free will come to lock it down, look out for tips that's hollow 
 (Wise Intelligent (of Poor Righteous Teachers)) 
 It's P.I.T. supreno 
 Mix it down, dedicated to Steve Feliciano 
 Directored that steam and gouge Danno 
 F' the five-oh pronto, 'cause I know 
 First head to take the white and burst lead 
 Never did but might have to do it 
 Lies twenty-five, hollow shots in a pro-active unit 
 7-A, M-J, stop the BS movement, that's how we do it 
 Mobilize the people, conscious *niggas* get to it 
 (Chorus: Mos Def (of Black Star)) 
 My people unite and let's all get down 
 We got to have one love, peace and understandin 
 One God, one love, one life 
 One aim, one voice, one fight 
 (Chorus 2: Mos Def) 
 My people unite, hop up and do a right 
 We got to have one love, peace and understandin 
 One God, one love, one life 
 One aim, one voice, one fight 
 My people unite, hop up and do a right (echoes) 
 Keep it tight y'all, do it right y'all 
 (Cappadonna) 
 Yo, forget police brutality, I worked for a salary 
 And did time for a crime I didn't commit 
 They tried to beat me in my head, make a brotha submit 
 Hit me in the face with sticks, lockin me down for bein around 
 Still remember, never surrender into the beast 
 The man, peace for Diallo 
 My reality is to fight back police brutality 
 (Crunch Lo (of Othorized F.A.M.)) 
 Mr. Officer got my trapped in a dark corridor 
 Long hallway, they in luck with the gunplay 
 Swing knight sticks, run thicker than Bloods and Crips 
 Harass mad cats and it don't make sense 
 Roll around in dark tints, fiendin to match finger prints 
 Search me down everyday and you still ain't content 
 (Rock (of Heltah Skeltah)) 
 Oh-oh-oh-oh 
 Calm your nerves down, bop your heads too high 
 Let 'em know Rock, stop wonderin why you keep gettin' knocked 
 'Cause you a part time dealer, prob'ly a part time pops 
 Not a part time killer, but them dudes is full time cops 
 Make a hustle stupid, you half *ass* black acts 
 Stack, use your head for than a hat rack, Jack 
 Start runnin' your life instead of runnin' the streets 
 Runnin' your mouth, oh yeah, stop runnin' from beasts
