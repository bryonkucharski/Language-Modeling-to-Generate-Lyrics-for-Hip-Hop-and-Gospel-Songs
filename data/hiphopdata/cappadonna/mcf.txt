Black solidarity day, arrest sentence 
 Looking at the moon he starts his coming soon 
 High like my man c'mon give me the fame 
 His flame is so bright, open up your life 
 Let me swim with your feelings 
 I love y'all to death get married to my song 
 I prolong, nigga, my style is real strong 
 Plus I stay dipped like the first day of school 
 Blood pool kid with the low cut fade 
 My darts is number one, playtime is over 
 Black October, my debt still correct 
 Revised and updated from the old temple 
 Big Pens is Tai Chi 
 Head crack shit my brains is Jet Lee 
 Put away your weapons its Master MC 
 One hundred skills if you ever try to fuck me 
 Feet come first, sometimes not the head 
 Some niggas eat, some don't get fed 
 If you live by the sword you might die by the lead 
 You get what you get if you thinking with your dick 
 MCF mean your thinking with your head 
 Money comes first this time I can't dead 
 You get what you get if you thinking with your dick 
 MCF mean your thinking with your head 
 Warp in the projects watch out for Ted 
 Hearse get your first, too late, no paramed 
 Dark Park Hill day, cold and sour 
 Its only Staten Island that represent the power 
 God body we stand, unite, kid, right 
 With the excellent beam of light, so stand still 
 Hold your breath, the late homicide hill 
 Before the big gates, everything was chill 
 SHAOLIN, it's like Hurricane Kim 
 SUUU, you better beware, we comin' in 
 Original, yeah it's the kid from back then 
 To all the pussy niggas that be tryin' to pretend 
 MCF killa bees, son what, you gotta problem 
 Deja vu, 45 slug that escalates 
 Don't perpetrate, hip hop is mine 
 Find something else, words is dealt, quarterly 
 In a orderly fashion, thrashin, black mamma javelins 
 Travellin, once again dun, try to comprehend 
 Catch a split end 
 I'm takin' trips downtown, havin' the shit go down 
 Fresh niggas, fresh hats, sometimes I carry gats 
 Low straps, baggy slacks, one forced the chain with the six gold caps 
 I go for dolo, hear my LP style for solo 
 Han Solo with his rap Star Wars goin' on tours for the course 
 Whirlwind, record spin, walk forward, explorin 
 The lime livin', plus thank heads forgivin 
 But sue the ones that don't, Cappa's goin' gold 
 Never sold my soul, twenty somethin' years old 
 Try for the globe, one time tastin the wine 
 Teeth are dumb, deaf, and blind, have strength 
 To go the whole length, for my two seeds, house these, 
 Tooth fairies, February sanctuaries, child support court 
 Days are too short, I'm completin all my goals, stay amped up 
 Be alert, secure the foundation, seek more education 
 That money can never worth, head first, feet first, whatever the case 
 MCF means fuck off kid, you outta place
