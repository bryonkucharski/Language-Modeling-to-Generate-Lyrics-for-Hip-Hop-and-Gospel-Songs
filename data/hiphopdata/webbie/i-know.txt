(Feat. Young Dro) 
 Speaking: 
 Say mel and t mayne 
 I'm a make a nigga feel on this 
 Pre-rap: 
 Top and bottom never walk in my neighborhood 
 (South baton rouge) 
 The candy lady out of business 'cause they take her goods 
 Play with me it's guaranteed, ooh, I'm a lay ya down 
 Gotta watch my back across my tracks god know I know these clowns 
 God know I know 
 I feel like can't nobody fuck with me 
 God got my back so 
 Lil boosie keep his mind at ease 
 And god know I know 
 That somebody gon hate on me 
 But god know I'm thug so 
 U know lil boosie go and get skeet 
 Now god know my situation, he know what I be facin 
 He know I'm so impatient when it come to money makin' 
 From school, to the blocks, from the tool, to the rocks 
 For the lil nigga with that glock ridin' aroun d in somethin' hot 
 Now it's bout time we hit our knees and tell god truth 
 Can't stop the way we livin' just help us make it through 
 When I die take me through, up to heaven up with you 
 Gotta holla at my daddy and my nigga griles to 
 And god know 
 And god know I'm thug life, u fuckin' right 
 So if nigga play with me of the op I gotta get him right 
 And god got my back so, when I act wow 
 I'm comin' home safely through the back do 
 The murder rate is sky high, nigga holla ride or die 
 These youngin sling that iron it ain't no mo takin' pride 
 So put yo fist up in yo pockets and them bullets in the chamber 
 Cause niggas slingin iron like the lone ranger 
 Mayne it's murder murder kill kill on the corner where the marijuana followed by the bill 
 Some niggas cut by delja, some niggas cut by chill, some niggas eat them delpids and some niggas eat them pills 
 Gotta get it how I live in the southside 
 I'm thuggin' with my cow hide 
 I'm fresh when I come outside 
 You talk shit got hog tied 
 God know I know these niggas 
 Don't make me show these niggas 
 Pray for these niggas keep me away from these niggas 
 And I 
 God know all the killas 
 He done walked with all them niggas 
 He done talked with all them niggas 
 Before they went sparked them trigger 
 He ain't tear ya up in church, but god pretty eyes done covered up some dirt 
 Plus he kept a thug alert 
 For these bitch ass niggas, these haters these rapists 
 These niggas in the swamp swear to god they alligators 
 Me an my niggas paper chasers (shit) we ain't stuntin 
 We do wat we gotta do, to get that money 
 And god know my past 
 I'm itchin to kill, gimme a reason I will 
 I'll end up grippin a steal 
 And god know my temper 
 My temper like a bubble 
 You bust it you in trouble 
 Only god know, it's hard yo, I'll lay up in ya yard wow 
 I'll camouflage myself with my camouflage cargo 
 The street ain't promised to us niggas in that dirty south 
 Thas why I'm ridin' with that nine I'm tryin' make it out 
 And it's hard to live, I'm a community where ain't no fuckin' unity 
 They always say I'm dead they try to ruin me 
 So boosie be on other shit 
 Like jew-el-r-is and poppin' chris 
 And mac on u a model bitch 
 Had a hoe that swallow dick 
 Since 12 I saw alot of shit god know I know 
 Witness a man get straight sprayed right in front of the store 
 So I get a blunt and I roll it, hit the block actin' a donkey 
 Killin' my own people, servin' my own uncles 
 And I 
 {Prayer} 
 Our father who art in heaven 
 Hollow be thy name 
 Thou kingdom come 
 Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven 
 But we stay reppin 
 But we stay they got beasts up in my section 
 I was raised bysome thugs, got rich off the d 
 80 grams took my nigga, I'm missin' ya petey 
 God know I need to send my niggas some pictures this 
 And som change to keep nigga fresj kicks on his feet 
 And god know he raised me 
 When donkey went jonsin 
 Bronson kept me wide open 
 And that's a fact 
 But I know they gon hate tho 
 'Cause I got blocks and raps and blocks of work so you can call me lego 
 It's consequences, jumpin' fences 
 Cause the narcs tryin' lynch us and they missin' us by inches 
 The judge the one who sentence make a nigga out a menace 
 Commisary low so we take a nigga tennis 
 A black eye is just like a scratch where I was raised 
 Niggas handle they business if they ever felt played 
 The beasts is crooked, the preacher crooked 
 Saw my teacher at the strip club, damn, the teachers crooked 
 Talking: 
 Now if don't nobody now 
 God know 
 Nigga u a hood rat 
 God know 
 A nigga try to bring you down 
 He right on side u 
 God know 
 Nigga tryin' steal yo girl you had fears 
 God know
