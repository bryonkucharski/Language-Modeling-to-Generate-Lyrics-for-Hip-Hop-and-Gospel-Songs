I can't eat unless it's mine, 
 I on it, that bitch's mine, 
 Please don't disrespect what's mine, 
 You best have it on your mind. 
 I've been doing this for some time. 
 Put mine all on the line. 
 Every time I get a dime, 
 I fuck it like it's mine. 
 That came from nothing, little mind, 
 I'm through hustling, no crime, 
 Came out hugging, 05, 
 Really thugging, no lies. 
 Stop talking, I'm riding on you walking. 
 In the game, still balling, 
 Clearly, I went through some losses. 
 I can't complain. I'm breathing, 
 So keep hating for no reason, 
 Different spouses every week-end, 
 Other houses every season. 
 I probably take her home, 
 And let her get her smurf on. 
 The sweet's on, and I know 
 I still got shit to work on. 
 But I'm gonna say this mine, 
 I call my grand-ma' mine, 
 I be with my mind to mind, 
 Really, my ol'lady mine, 
 They gon'talk, but I don't mind. 
 Like I don't have no mind, 
 Yeah, all my jury mine, 
 Whole amnesia, blurry mind. 
 But I'm gonna say this mine, 
 I call my grand-ma' mine, 
 I be with my mind to mind, 
 Really, my ol'lady mine, 
 They gon'talk, but I don't mind. 
 Like I don't have no mind, 
 Yeah, all my jury mine, 
 Whole amnesia, blurry mind. 
 And I sound like my mind, 
 I got diamonds get you blind, 
 Have I ever asked yu for a verse, no, 
 Forget it, I don't mind, 
 'Cause I don't need your high life. 
 True family, I've got mine, 
 My whole ? getting you, 
 Help me, no help you?! No, yes, I do. 
 You fuck your wife for me, 
 Friends wage their life for me, 
 Offer all this shit for me, 
 And the other half for Lil' P. 
 Eh, no, yeah, my top of mind, 
 I don't wait inside no line, 
 They saw anybody cross the line? 
 I can say, no, that ain't mine! 
 I ain't selfish, I'm just keppling, 
 I believe in devils, 
 I know they'll take me away for ever, 
 Ever ever. 
 What you see here is mine, 
 Savage life for life. 
 And I don't have no time to waist time. 
 My new Mercedes's mine, 
 I call my grand-ma' mine, 
 I be with my mind to mind, 
 Really, my ol'lady mine, 
 They gon'talk, but I don't mind. 
 Like I don't have no mind, 
 Yeah, all my jury mine, 
 Whole amnesia, blurry mind. 
 That's why all these dollars' mine, 
 And all these bottles' mine, 
 I'm a walking dollar sign? 
 I like my business fine. 
 I got fire, kid, blaze, 
 I got all my bills paid, 
 Through these dollar dollar safes. 
 It look like I got them made. 
 I gotta go to see my all, 
 I got a house that's not my home, 
 And it's for my Libu 4, 
 You look like you need a loan, 
 I've got charters and lawyers, 
 I'm working hard for my daughters, 
 All my niggers keep throbbing, 
 I swear this shit be like poison. 
 My new Mercedes's mine, 
 Your new old lady's mine, 
 Yeah, don't disrespect my mind, 
 I give a shout out for my grand-ma, 
 You know I love you, mine, 
 Gon'be a thriller, gonna do it, 
 And I'mma make that mine, 
 I'll take my toys, what is mine, 
 Keep God on my side, 
 And with that, be a man, 
 You'll be fine. 
 The resorts, keep 'em tight, 
 Dimple soldiers, know it's right, 
 Just a piece of my advice, 
 Feel good for life. 
 My new Mercedes's mine, 
 I call my grand-ma' mine, 
 I be with my mind to mind, 
 Really, my ol'lady mine, 
 They gon' talk, but I don't mind. 
 Like I don't have no mind, 
 Yeah, all my jury mine, 
 Whole amnesia, blurry mind.
