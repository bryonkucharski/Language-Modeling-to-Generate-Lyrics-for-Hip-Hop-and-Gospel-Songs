 Then come to me and I can treat you like my own girl 
 Touch you like my own girl, take you round my home boy 
 And can take you by the house and let you check out my four car garage 
 And put her on a pedaltal, then I let that hoe massage 
 All up on my back, licked on my nut and then I fucked her hard 
 Hey baby what you doing she say nothing watching kids 
 Put they ass to sleep, I'm coming through I want some fucking head 
 I'm like the nothing and nigga fade, just look and I know the nigga fake 
 And may be fake and they'll be hating when I ain't around 
 Take a ride in round town, with the top down 
 With the music go loud, pull her pants down, dick her down 
 Chillin' want the ground, you can go and check my back ground 
 Got love for this down hoe keep it on the down low 
 See my down chick and I'm a down
