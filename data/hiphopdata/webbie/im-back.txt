I'm back, I'm back, I heard he said that he was ready for Webbie said where he at. 
 The trill fam y'all wouldn't have made it where he at. 
 A whole clique of squares I bet you somebody would have rat. 
 Scary Cat. Scary Cat. 
 Couldn't nothin' kill us, 
 I told you lil bitches way back that I'm the trilliss take a picture of me, 
 Listen to me y'all been dunkin bullets, now I'm back and tell a nigga fuck em. 
 R.I.P to my big cousin it really touched me 
 And they need to free lil B not just for me but for the streets, they love em. 
 What up for rock you know it's hotter than a pot 
 And yeah you know there somewhere plottin 
 But it ain nothin' we just gone keep on goin' 
 I still don't know when they gone stop 
 So I'm just layin up in the rain and I can see the sun shinin' 
 And it just keep on pourin, tourin round the world 
 Different cities gettin' titties 
 The realest niggas walk up and they tell me I'm the realest one 
 So many independent women clown 
 I can give you one so you can move on 
 That with her get off the couch and stop bein a bum busta 
 Show y'all I don't even know y'all, and tell yo home boy his hoe called 
 I'm back and you know it I did it then I rolled it 
 And you know what I be cheifin and I keep it like I grow it 
 And no you don't wanna go there 
 I bet I can stoop the lowest highest that I can get 
 I just open pounds and I blow 'em half my friends up in jail 
 The other half of them want it I'm back it's savage life 
 I done got up on my paper my next door neighbor a joker 
 I can't sleep hoes up on me everywhere 
 I go they be on me y'all just take 'em fuck 'em duck em 
 Give them hoes to my homies they love to come to my parties 
 They know my shit be the crunkest big bag of weed and pink bottles 
 Let's see who can get the drunkest I'm back I know y'all missed me 
 I spit this shit like we want it 
 That's why all the bad bitches and trill niggas be on it 
 Real niggas really feel it the killas get to killin' 
 All the hustla's get to hustlin and chillas they just be chillin' 
 I'm back, I'm back, I'm back, I'm back, I'm back.
