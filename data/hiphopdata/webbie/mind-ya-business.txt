Hey, I need another plate nigga, fuck 
 Yup,

 Look 
 Niggas posted on they block 
 Nose way around the corner 
 Sniffin nutz around here 
 Man, you stay way around the corner 
 You been yapping like a hoe 
 That's what say around the corner 
 If you know it like I know 
 You better stay around the corner 
 I don't know shit about no murder 
 I was way in California 
 With bun b ridin' dirty 
 Smoking purple all that morning 
 I don't know shit about no robbery 
 Throwing the wrong charges on me 
 I was chillin' wit yo wife 
 While you was flightin, an she was lonely 
 All that pussy azz shit you niggas offering 
 I don't want it 
 I don't want to hit yo weed 
 And I don't wanna be yo homie 
 Man, let me make my cheese 
 Get the j's to match my jeans 
 Go post back up in my jeans 
 And let 'em go for 2 for 3 
 You around here saying my name 
 And claiming I ain't a beast 
 Regardless of my fame 
 Bitch I'll aim it up at yo cheek 
 Before I was rhyming on a beat 
 I was grindin on the street 
 Pussy ass nigga worrying 'bout me 
 Click, clak 
 Say lil daddy, listen mind ya business 
 You just like one of these lil bitches, mind ya business 
 Being nosey, you your sickening, mind ya business 
 Ole police ass nigga, mind ya business 
 Repeat 1
