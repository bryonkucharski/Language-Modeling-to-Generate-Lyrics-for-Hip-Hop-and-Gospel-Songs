(Feat. Big Head) 
 Wassup wassup wassup 
 Turn it up 
 Webbie 
 Trill E-N-T. Young Savage 
 Just some gangsta shit for the gangstas to ride to 
 "Damn mane, what you don't fuck with a nigga no mo? " 
 Don't even come at me like that! 
 "Damn nigga, Webbie, where you been at? " 
 Out here gettin' rich nigga. Fuck out my face. 
 I'm a fuckin' hustler nigga, I ain't got time to be playin' nigga, I'm tryin' get it. 
 (I'm tryin' to do somethin'.) 
 Check me out, Look 
 Now I'mma tell you like a man, I don't owe y'all shit 
 And I'm gonna say this shit again, 
 I don't owe y'all shit. 
 But before a nigga had somethin', (shitt) 
 I ain't have nothin' (my kids) 
 Yeah they still love me (friends) 
 I had a couple of em 
 Wasn't nobody fussin, tryin' to see what was up 
 When my shoes was been dusty, with a hole in the front 
 And I'd get mad at Lil Slugger, he put a hole in the blunt 
 When my daddy lost the house, moved with grandma for a month 
 Then that month turned into a year 
 And I turned strait to them streets 
 Then my dog gave me that b 
 I turned the shit to that heat 
 Them school fights turned to that beef 
 And we was gon fall for that street 
 Then my nigga turned to that piece 
 I ain't seen him since I was 13 
 I get home and catch my knees 
 This rap shit was just a dream 
 Wasn't nobody mad at me tellin' me about how I need to come see em 
 I ain't have a car, I just need some new rims 
 Just tell ole boy he just got a new Benz 
 My daddy used to tell me that I needed some new friends 
 I guess back then, it just didn't make since 
 Now come on 
 Keep it trill 
 You been knowin' me since I was lil 
 And you ain't even take me serious mane that's why a nigga feel like (You a Trip!) 
 How you be trippin' (You a Trip!) 
 I be trippin' (You a Trip!) 
 How I be glistenin (You a Trip!) 
 It's a trip over postiton (You a Trip!) 
 It's a trip how you miss me (You a Trip!) 
 Now don't take it wrong and think I'm trippin' 'cause I'm on 
 But um really you can go on and leave me the fuck alone (You a Trip!) 
 How you be trippin' (You a Trip!) 
 I be trippin' (You a Trip!) 
 How I be glistenin (You a Trip!) 
 It's a trip over postiton (You a Trip!) 
 It's a trip how you miss me (You a Trip!) 
 I had to tell lil nigga from the club 
 I'm still the same nigga from the mud 
 So watch how you be runnin' up questionin me about stupid stuff 
 I'm well known from the boot and up 
 Don't come up to me with that bootin up 
 Mane how I been movin up 
 I really hate to have to go and shoot ya up 
 In just 2000 I was ridin' a bus 
 Show up at school, get expelled, fuck it 
 I'm out here, If I go to jail, fuck it 
 Didn't this many people care for me 
 Now a nigga rich you is there for me 
 And I owe you this and I owe you that (What?) 
 You not nothin' till you got somethin', everbody love ya 
 Pops told me that 
 Niggas ain't shit, life showed me that 
 They done stole from me 
 They done hold me back 
 You round here actin' like hoes would act 
 Tell me how I'm supposed to act 
 I see yo ass, be yo ass 
 Comin' up, I ain't barely see yo ass 
 Tryin' to be me, be done beat yo ass 
 Hard head, make a nigga teach yo ass 
 Tell you the truth, I don't need yo ass 
 All I really need is my dog fans 
 And all my people that I feel fam 
 This big glock 40 and Trill Fam 
 Y'all look mad, I'mma steal laugh 
 Them new Camaros go real fast 
 They don't come out till "09" already got mine 
 Man I'm fittin to act a dog now 
 Now come on 
 Keep it trill 
 You been knowin' me since I was lil 
 And you ain't even take me serious mane that's why a nigga feel like (You a Trip!) 
 How you be trippin' (You a Trip!) 
 I be trippin' (You a Trip!) 
 How I be glistenin (You a Trip!)

 It's a trip how you miss me (You a Trip!) 
 Now don't take it wrong and think I'm trippin' 'cause I'm on 
 But um really you can go on and leave me the fuck alone (You a Trip!) 
 How you be trippin' (You a Trip!)

 How I be glistenin (You a Trip!) 
 It's a trip over postiton (You a Trip!) 
 It's a trip how you miss me (You a Trip!) 
 (Verse 3: Big Head) 
 Look, Big Head the same nigga till he dead and gone 
 The same nigga that wasn't allowed in yo home 
 The same nigga that did that same dirt with that chrome 
 The same nigga that did them same jokestas all along 
 Why would I change now 
 Just because the camera's on 
 And yo girl got my dick in her camera phone 
 Mane let me do my thing 
 I'm in that zone 
 You hatin' 'cause I'm makin' and you dead wrong 
 Well if you ain't gon kill me, 
 Ain't no stoppin' me 
 Watch, I get the whole board on Monopoly 
 Matter fact, fuck y'all with a apostrophe 
 That is how you want it 
 So that is how it gotta be 
 I probably pop yo ass approximately with 6 slugs 
 While Turk and Mel buy the judge 
 You got a grudge but remember I don't give a fuck 
 Whenever you get mad enough, 
 Try yo luck! 
 Now come on 
 Keep it trill 
 You been knowin' me since I was lil 
 And you ain't even take me serious mane that's why a nigga feel like (You a Trip!) 
 How you be trippin' (You a Trip!) 
 I be trippin' (You a Trip!) 
 How I be glistenin (You a Trip!) 
 It's a trip over postiton (You a Trip!) 
 It's a trip how you miss me (You a Trip!) 
 Now don't take it wrong and think I'm trippin' 'cause I'm on 
 But um really you can go on and leave me the fuck alone (You a Trip!) 
 How you be trippin' (You a Trip!) 
 I be trippin' (You a Trip!) 
 How I be glistenin (You a Trip!) 
 It's a trip over postiton (You a Trip!) 
 It's a trip how you miss me (You a Trip!)
