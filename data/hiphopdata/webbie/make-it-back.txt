Trill Entertainment nigga mic check, Webbie and Boosie 
 Ya heard me, this how its goin' down nigga, check it out 
 Back up bitch, back up bitch, back up 
 C'mon, trill entertainment 
 Yo hood can't fuck with mine 
 Now I know, that you ain't really bout that shit that you be talkin' about 
 And you be just runnin' ya mouth but you'll get knocked out and 
 Drug out the club house we thugged out 
 Showin' off with yo thugs, me and my thugs'll make yo thugs bounce 
 I, suggest that you respect it 
 Disrespect I'll have to check it and when I check it gets hectic 
 You don't want no savage doin' no damage to yo section 
 While I fuck yo baby mama, she say fuck my baby daddy 
 If a nigga wants some static let 'em have that's the G-Code 
 Since 94' I been throwed up in beast mode 
 Street life is all I know, sellin' yo money, cars and clothes 
 Rubber real don't fuck with hoes, unload and reload 
 We G's y'all hoes, y'all ain't ready to swang with us 
 Since youngstas growin' up y'all people wouldn't let y'all hang with us 
 Your people prolly told you don't play with guns boy they dangerous 
 My peeps don't play with guns they stay with guns and I slangin em

 'Cause I love my hood and I'mma represent in this bitch 
 Now in the parking lot, I had that 40 Glock ready 
 That gin gon' keep me hype when I be watchin' over Webbie 
 In my city AP9's and Smith and Wessons 
 Thugs who second guessin' them the ones who be restin' 
 God gave me a blessing, told me get the crowd crunk 
 Say Boo don't change yo style give the crowd what they want (look) 
 Now I'm that rumble in the jungle, 2004 Hummer stunna 
 My momma, she still wonder why her son's a young gunner 
 Back back, back back, get out my way let me mob 
 All that bumpin' into niggas played out in 95'

 Better stop that actin' lil' savage'll beat you black and blue 
 I been abused you gotta excuse my attitude 
 Plus I been smokin' hy-dro and drinkin' yak and brews 
 I been a fool out here packin' tools since middle school 
 I been a fool I had the most loot up in the school 
 A phone book of referrals, I ain't follow no rules 
 Be quiet in class, don't act bad, raise ya hand was ho rules 
 I skipped the class and act a ass and sold some crack to white dudes 
 Between class smoked Kools and big blunts before school 
 Straight up menace, got a nigga glad I ain't go to your school 
 Played them hoes, I woulda played you like a ho too 
 That's that boy I don't like, he start fights everywhere he goes to 
 But proudly I don't give a fuck, try me I'll fight you 
 Hold up back up a bit you fuckin' up my white shoes 
 All right I asked you once, BITCH MOVE!
