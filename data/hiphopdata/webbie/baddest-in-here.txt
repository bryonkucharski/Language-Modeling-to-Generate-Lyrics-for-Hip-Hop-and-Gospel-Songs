 Lookin' for a friend girl, tryna let her hold something 
 Pull up in a cold something, bought a whole dozen bottles 
 Da club still bucking jus to throw something 
 Just got finished smokin' a cigar, finna roll something

 Stupid as chain on, I spent a hundred something 
 Bent her over like a dawg, I had her running from me 
 Ask me where I came from, I told dat hoe from nothin' 
 Lil pretty perky titties, booty like a bubble

 Heard it was gone be jumpin', so I jus had to come

 'Hind closed doors, all dey do is suck big boys 
 Everytime I go up to da awards, Imma get one 
 Matter fact me and Phat just gone just stick one 
 Really in da streets mane, I ain't just on 
 Da microphone checkers, dey crack up under pressure 
 Lookin' for da baddest bitch up in here 
 And wen I get her, Imma hit her and forget her 
 And name a nigga trilla, I'll admit it 
 Ain't da richest nigga, but my cake, straight 
 And most of these other niggas fake

 Let 'em hate

 I want my bitch to be a big fine ass juicy 
 And you don't have to tell her, she know wat she doing

 Da bitch standing still, but her booty still moving 
 Can catch me in a benz drop top just cruising 
 Or even in da club popping bottles wit a cutie 
 Da niggas hollering at me, sayin' Webbie how ya do it 
 Got dat type of shit, dat a make everybody loose it 
 These niggas rapping bout gettin' money
