(Webbie-Talking) 
 Hello, Young Savage 
 What you doin'?, Trill E-N-T 
 (I'll be missin' you, I'll be missin' you), Webbie 
 (Verse 1-Webbie) 
 I ain't been home in a few days (I miss you) 
 I know you do, I ain't gon'lie I miss you too 
 Come kiss me through the phone, I'ma kiss you too 
 Now I'ma hit you in a minute-gotta get this loot 
 Girl we got us somethin' special, I know it ain't nothin' better 
 You can trust me 'cause I'm tellin' ya I don't want nothin' else 
 You get lonely you can just use the pictures up on the dresser 
 I ain't never think a woman could have me this lil'feelin' 
 Girls'll walk up on me flirtin, I be tellin' e'm "Nah I'm chillin" 
 Hug you till I go to sleep just to squeeze you like my lil'pillow 
 Then I wake up Monday mornin'don't come back till Friday 
 In my whole 'nother whip, sittin' on 6's with tinted windows 
 Baby phat bags, all the purses with matchin'slippers 
 You done heard I fucked this dumb bitch-now you mad trippin' 
 Tears in ya eyes, yellin' you tired of my fast livin' 
 I'm just happy for to see ya, godamn... I miss you 
 (Chorus-Le'Toya) 
 Since you went away, I been down and lonely 
 Since you went away, I been thinkin' of you 
 Ooh I'm missin' you, Ooh I'm missin' you 
 (Verse 2-Webbie) 
 From rags to riches, if that xxxx was to hit me again 
 I'd have to bring you with me again 
 It done been alot of stuff I found myself in 
 And you stuck by a nigga like my left hand 
 It wasn't all this at first, till we just kept prayin' 
 Now I'm on-and you a bad xxx bitch, Yes maam 
 And oh yes maam as soon as I get home it's gon'be work time 
 And you know us we like to xxxx like it's the first time 
 You tell the first time for some reason 
 I knew that I was stayin'and I figured you wasn't leavin' 
 I know that I don't need ya, but be feelin' like I need ya 
 When it come to certain people, I act like I got a meetin' 
 But I just wanna please ya-trust me they just wanna be ya 
 Whenever I ain't wit ya baby I can't wait to see ya 
 I gotta keep it G and say I love ya, 'cause I'm fuh real 
 I wash away all the tears, we been doin' this xxxx for years 
 (Chorus-Le'Toya) 
 Since you went away, I been down and lonely 
 Since you went away, I been thinkin' of you 
 Ooh I'm missin' you, Ooh I'm missin' you 
 (Bridge-Le'Toya) 
 Ya everything I need, couldn't have asked for more 
 Boy you know you were, waitin for 
 I know you wonder why I'm standin at the door 
 To let you know, I miss you 
 And you will see it in my eyes 
 You're the completion to my life 
 Ain't even a question, you already know 
 But I remind you that, I miss you
