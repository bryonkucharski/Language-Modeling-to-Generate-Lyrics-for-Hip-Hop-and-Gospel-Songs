She say he say? 
 No, 
 Say! 
 She say he say? 
 Say it! 
 Whatever, man, this shit is crazy! 
 She say every time she talk is like I never listen, 
 Ask me why we never kiss, she say seem like I'm always flipping, 
 She say every time she talk is like I never listen, 
 Act like all I like is money running around with different bitches. 
 She say every time she talk is like I never listen, 
 Ask me why we never kiss, she say seem like I'm always flipping, 
 She say every time she talk is like I never listen,

 She's got a new phone, 
 I wiped out the slow songs, 
 Tell me how this whole gone, 
 Said she's 'bout to move on. 
 Bye, ain't gonna cry. 
 Now, this the reason why 
 I keep a bitch on the side. 
 But she's holding nigger down 
 And now she say she's tired. 
 Wow, my life, see, 
 She ain't feeling to cry, 
 No more. No. It just give you a hole, 
 When you wanna hit assailing, 
 Bust it open on the floor. 
 I never had coffee, I'm not a popo, 
 But you know you got to squeeze, 
 I got you two to leave. 
 Man, you know I got that cheap, 
 And you know how it be, 
 I can lay up on the Ubber, 
 I'm too much up in the streets. 
 She say every time she talk is like I never listen, 
 Ask me why we never kiss, she say seem like I'm always flipping, 
 She say every time she talk is like I never listen, 
 Act like all I like is money running around with different bitches. 
 ? I'm telling you the truth, 
 I've got a family at home, bu. 
 That's hard to believe, 
 And yet, I do what I want, too. 
 But my baby ain't tripping, she know who I belong to. 
 She know I keep a list of bad bitches I'm known to, 
 But I won't be doing nothing, my reputation's too strong, too. 
 Be with all that side shit, so I won't even try the shit. 
 Climb first, cloud then, collide with my side bitch. 
 Buy shit, she riding it, take a spin like classic, 
 She's on her ass, she's so happy that she's my bitch. 
 And she's got a nigger, probably a lot of niggers, 
 I bought her a phone, she call me when she ain't by the niggers. 
 And she's straight by the money, how she's doing a lot of niggers. 
 I watch her clothes clothes, ? 
 I drive her crazy, though, she my little baby, though, 
 And she already know every time I hit the dough. 
 She say every time she talk is like I never listen, 
 Ask me why we never kiss, she say seem like I'm always flipping, 
 She say every time she talk is like I never listen, 
 Act like all I like is money running around with different bitches. 
 Now, how you gonna say that, girl, you know that ain't right! 
 You know I like you, you know I love life. 
 I love ice, I love cars, I love living. 
 I love seeing my niggers walking about the freezers. 
 I'm on a mission, got no time to be hugging and kissing. 
 Time going fast, baby I gotta get it. 
 I love growing money, I hate it being broke, 
 I love t smoke, but reggae is what I hate the most. 
 I rather trip than slip, baby, and I ain't slipping. 
 If you leave, you be ready to miss me. You can't blame me, 
 It's what the streets did me, what? You forgot 
 That you promised that you'll be here with me? 
 We'll fuck ? but you'll never forget me, 
 Think I'mma loose me the sleep, girl, forget it! 
 And then we brake-up, and then we make-up, 
 I just can't leave this girl alone, shit, say what? 
 She say every time she talk is like I never listen, 
 Ask me why we never kiss, she say seem like I'm always flipping, 
 She say every time she talk is like I never listen, 
 Act like all I like is money running around with different bitches.
