 I heat the streets up like a oven, it ain't nothin' 
 I want mine just hit me up when it's "on time" 
 I ain't duct-taped me a nigga up in a long time! 
 I'm'a die thuggin' I think I'm'a die bustin' 
 I'm'a die hustlin, 'cause I refuse to die with nothin' 
 Bumpin' crews who drove from Cali in my old school two-tone 
 They missed me niggas barely, I want they whole fuckin' crew gone! 
 In that zone, where there ain't no smirks, niggas get murked 
 Just keep hidin 'cause it's too late to go to church, now 
 Show you muthafuckers how this trill shit work, now 
 Turn your shit into the 4th of Ju-ly, boo-ya!
