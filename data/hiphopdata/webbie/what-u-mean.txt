What you mean, what you mean, 
 I ain't feel what you mean, 
 I ain't feel how you feel, 
 What you mean what you mean? 
 What you saying, what you saying, 
 What it is what you saying, 
 What it is, what it is, 
 What you saying, what you saying? 
 How you feel, how you feel, 
 What you may, what you may. 
 I heard somebody looking for me? 
 Triple deal O.D. 
 I'm still right here, 
 In the middle of the heat, 
 Keep real while playing 
 In the middle of the street. 
 What it gonna be? 
 If you got it on your mind, 
 I don't really don't need it, 
 The place and the time, 
 I'm from the army, 
 You and me, we play rowdy, 
 Me and A-Town, we can do it like that. 
 You wanna know what I've been doing lately? 
 I just stayed up to celebrate D. 
 Take me aside right before your right boyfriend 
 I'm real, you haters, I brought my nuts, 
 Sell a couple of Bemzez, couple of years in the pen, 
 And all my friends, they all gotta play it, 
 I'm just saying what y'all are thinking, 
 So fuck you all and all your friends! 
 Figgiding right and the casket grow, 
 Then get your big nick by the bad ass ho, 
 Know what I'm saying, no, right, let me tell you, 
 Wanna tell you a little bit of what I found, though. 
 Tell me about it, I'm way about it, 
 When I holler, make me come talk to. 
 Some of that beef shit I eat that, 
 But I'm bleeding all out. 
 What you mean, what you mean, 
 I ain't feel what you mean, 
 I ain't feel how you feel, 
 What you mean what you mean? 
 What you saying, what you saying, 
 What it is what you saying, 
 What it is, what it is, 
 What you saying, what you saying? 
 How you feel, how you feel, 
 What you may, what you may. 
 They throw a lot of swirls 
 And the guy in the splurge, 
 They sliding when I see 'em, 
 They don't say nothing. 
 They've got a lot of peep 
 And the real, I'mma sure they 
 Don't want in a motherfucker. 
 Now, ain't that something? 
 Hey, I'm buzzing, now, 
 Ain't you gonna tell me? 
 I am B.T., you gonna allow your branch? 
 Sneaking on a nigger, well, it ain't no thing. 
 I've got a man colded out, white like cocaine. 
 You feel so wet and I feel so fine, 
 Man, he'll smoke and pray for the rain. 
 A wide flow and the glock glow, 
 Free little bee under my toe, 
 You taking it all on a shopping spree, 
 Not for me, that's fine, ho, 
 You cross me and you die, ho! 
 Put your head on a high bowl! 
 All I know is be guilty, 
 I fuck like it's a big a deal, 
 Want to pick at me, 
 Is you blind, nigger? 
 It ain't about that, stop lying, nigger! 
 I'm a dick to the gangsters here. 
 Ain't no rehab, they can't help me, 
 I'm so crazy and so wealthy, 
 Do you smell me, stay for Nelly! 
 What you mean, what you mean, 
 I ain't feel what you mean, 
 I ain't feel how you feel, 
 What you mean what you mean? 
 What you saying, what you saying, 
 What it is what you saying, 
 What it is, what it is, 
 What you saying, what you saying? 
 How you feel, how you feel, 
 What you may, what you may. 
 Thrill nigger, look, man! 
 You understand that I am the game. 
 Like an animal. Got no remorse, 
 You can't explain. I show you, though, 
 And I know you know, got a hydro 
 On my nice role, got a T.V. on my El Paso, 
 I knee niggers at my toe. 
 Nigger, I ain't got no vato, 
 Nigger trying to get what I been had, 
 Came here with no lights on 
 My python, I talk shit and I'm iron. 
 I'm lighting them up like a paizan. 
 Like J.J. in New York, we're casing 
 Fucking wholes. The daybreak, be right back. 
 Go make cake. Get me straight, my enemies running late. 
 I constantly get elate. Yes, 
 I'm a big bitches bait, 
 I'm that nigger, make no mistake, 
 Who round before I regulate, 
 Think 'fo you say what you say, 
 Bitch, all I can do is pray. 
 What you mean, what you mean, 
 I ain't feel what you mean, 
 I ain't feel how you feel, 
 What you mean what you mean? 
 What you saying, what you saying, 
 What it is what you saying, 
 What it is, what it is, 
 What you saying, what you saying? 
 How you feel, how you feel, 
 What you may, what you may.
