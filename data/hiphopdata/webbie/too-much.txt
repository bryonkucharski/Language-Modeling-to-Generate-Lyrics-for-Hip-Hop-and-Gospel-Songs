You're too much, you're too much 
 You're too much, you're too much 
 I thought I'd came through later on when you're home alone 
 And you don't have nothing on, just your thong alone 
 We can open up some bottles, we can roll up a zone 
 Or we can get straight to the point and we can getting it on 
 She mad, she say I visit her wrong and every time she hit me up I never pick up the phone 
 I told her, 'Listen, baby, girl, I've been missing, you're gone 
 But 'on my agenda, I've been getting along' 
 You go to sleep in them expensive gowns 
 I must admit she really one of the baddest bitches around 
 I thought if she independent know how bitches get down 
 She probably is, I don't ever see no niggas around 
 Probably 'cause she done figured it out'the bullshit, know what niggas about 
 'Get a job, just wanna sit in your home, I tell her I'm a different fella, come on, listen me out 
 You know the time pass when you're having fun or don't 
 Fine ass, you been tripping me off 
 She hotter than a devil, on another level 
 I ain't wanna sweat here, really all that I could tell her was 
 You're too much, you're too much 
 You're too much, you're too much 
 She hotter than a devil, on another level 
 I ain't wanna sweat here, really all that I could tell her was 
 You're too fine so every time you slide through 
 Everybody gotta look at least two times 
 I don't play crazy'playing hard to get but I'mma get mad due time 
 The lady got her own cheddar, she don't need mine 
 I don't need hers so don't matter, we both fine 
 I stand back and I look better from both sides 
 High born, bad bitch, we both fine 
 Now it ain't just for that ass kiss that does shine 
 Better cop a dime, as it is it's gonna be stroke time 
 Hit the club, ice up, white silk'when I spot her up in no time 
 She can bag it up like she ain't got no spine 
 Quite and leave a broke ass nigga like a clothes line 
 She don't want an old man, says she got her own self 
 'Girl, you know you something else 
 On some whole other shit, way, way out of here 
 You ain't gotta say a thing, it's already clear 
 You're too much, you're too much 
 You're too much, you're too much 
 She hotter than a devil, on another level 
 I ain't wanna sweat here, really all that I could tell her was 
 I ain't gonna lie, you a bad bitch and you marry but I'm the savage 
 I talk a lot of shit but I can bag it, might get you whine first, I make you come first 
 I make you feel good when it don't feel right 
 And even though it's wrong, I make it feel right 
 And you ain't never cheated but you still might 
 I say we go and cop a firestorm and live life 
 She hotter than a devil, on another level 
 I ain't wanna sweat here, really all that I could tell her was 
 You're too much, you're too much 
 You're too much, you're too much 
 She hotter than a devil, on another level 
 I ain't wanna sweat here, really all that I could tell her was 
 You're too much, you're too much 
 You're too much, you're too much
