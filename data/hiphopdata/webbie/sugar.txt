If I said you wasn't the world to me, I'd be lying 
 And you're the only one 
 I told you, your one of a kind 
 I go this all the way for you I think you're a dime 
 I came from the bottom to the top, bottom line 
 Sometime we kiss, sometime we don't in a long time 
 But still gonna be together forever, that's a long time 
 Permanent scars but the pain never really lasts 
 Eventually we cool off 
 We're just a really? 
 You know this album is a regular old dog fight 
 We just laugh and apologize all night 
 I never told you 
 How I could picture you standing in a all white dress 
 And a dude on our piano with somewhere were its sunny in the island 
 Walking and smiling, the preacher get to talkin' 
 So happy you start crying 
 And we promise on our mamas 
 We'll do good through the dramas 
 We ain't even in the in 
 Ain't no reason they can even make a move 
 I'm so caught up in fuckin' love wit ya, baby 
 Deep and it feels sweet, sugar 
 No tellin' what I do behind you, crazy 
 And just living this is killing me, Mercedes 
 I'm so caught up in fuckin' love wit ya, baby 
 Deep and it feels sweet, sugar 
 No tellin' what I do behind you, crazy 
 And just living this is killing me, Mercedes 
 Its feeling like we done been everywhere but heaven, hell 
 Man I must be trippin', I hear wedding bells 
 And then you bust me doin' nothin', you know it never fails 
 Then I'll be hurt 
 'Cause you heard somethin' that wasn't even real 
 Yeah I'm gon' lie and tears gon'cry 
 Your face gonna dry as the years go by 
 I done reached a point to man up to say that I was silly 
 To even be up in some places, no I'm not admitting 
 We should be in a honey moon like somewhere in britian 
 A castle with a hundred rooms, I ain't bull shittin' 
 I'm ready to say I do, I say it loud and proud 
 I'm just askin God what's gonna happen if I break my vows 
 Will you ban me or understand me? 
 From fuckin' different hoes 
 Fuck me up for saying marry me 
 Another woman told me she think I should get a grammy 
 Actin' like I love her, she just couldn't understand me 
 I'm so caught in fucking love with you, baby 
 Deep and it feels sweet, sugar 
 Don't tell 'em what I do behind you, crazy 
 And just living this is killing me, Mercedes 
 I'm so caught in fucking love with you, baby 
 Deep and it feels sweet, sugar 
 Don't tell 'em what I do behind you, crazy 
 And just living this is killing me, Mercedes 
 We done did all that 
 We might as well go in 
 With my crazy ass people and your messy friends 
 And the screamin' and the hollerin about leavin' shit 
 And Lord I knows I don't wanna go through that again 
 Look me in my eyes and promise to me that your stayin 
 And we'll go to the top 
 I promise to you that's the plan 
 And you know my ways 
 Can you put up with all my stuff 
 And all that cussin' and the fussin' for all the days 
 With your crazy ass 
 And you know I'ma keep you mad 
 You know I bust my ass to see you glad 
 And you been with me since rags 
 And now we richer if you really pay attention 
 Bar our life's a pretty picture 
 And I wanna spend the rest of it wit ya 
 Like you make me stronger 
 You never thought less of a nigga 
 Not you and that's why I got you 
 Before you think it's not true I do 
 Wake up 
 I'm so caught in fucking love with you, baby 
 Deep and it feels sweet, sugar 
 Don't tell 'em what I do behind you, crazy 
 And just living this is killing me, Mercedes 
 I'm so caught in fucking love with you, baby 
 Deep and it feels sweet, sugar 
 Don't tell 'em what I do behind you, crazy 
 And just living this is killing me, Mercedes
