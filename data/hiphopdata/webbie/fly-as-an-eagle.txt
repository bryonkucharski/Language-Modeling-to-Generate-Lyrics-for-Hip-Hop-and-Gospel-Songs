 [Chorus:] 
 I Stay Fly As A Eagle Mane, (Oooh) 
 Fresh Like Candy Paint, (Fresh)

 Gotta Momma Up In Hemming Dat I Miss Miss Miss, 
 I Ain't Use To Have Nuttin Now I'm Rich Rich Rich,

 We Blowin' Purp In Tha Front, They Pouring Yac In Tha Back, 
 A Couple Gats In Tha Back And Ain't None Of Us Gon' Rat, 
 If I Ain't Already Ripped 'Em, My Brotha Boosie Dun Flipped 'Em, 
 We Get High Like A Missile And We Be Clean As A Whistle, 
 I Lay Dat Dick Like A Winner, Jus' Ask My Girls In Virginia, 
 They Jus' Can't Stand When It's Soft And Wanna Scream (Ahhhhh) When It's In 'Em, 
 I Be With Pimp, We Be Pimpin, From San Francisco To Memphis, 
 I Cut Tha Baddest Of Bitches, And Then Fa' Get When I'm Finish, (Who?) 
 I Jus' Talk A Lil' Shit And Then It's A Hit When I'm Finished, 
 I Drop Tha Top When It's Pretty Or Pop Tha 6 In A Minute,

 We Gon' Need Some Mo' Space Cause Money Stack To Tha Ceilin' Yea
