Show you how to be man, how to be the boss 
 How to come through with seven coats of the gloss 
 Show you how to be man, show you how to be man 
 Show you how to be man, how to be the boss 
 How to buy the car, how to buy the house 
 Show you how to be man, show you how to be man 
 Uh back in eight grade, banana berry wrist 
 Teacher wanna tell me be realistic 
 That bitch tryna tell me be realistic? 
 I pull up 5 years later in a drop top six 
 Butterscotch twist, cheek-checklin' lipstick 
 Might be in a movie, with Barry Sanders 
 Might be Adam Sandler, and my cup is pink panther 
 High School, I-I-I was on the news 
 Fist full of jewels looks like a swimming pool 
 Aqua-shock start, glow in the dark shark 
 Mark my words, I don't need acceptance 
 I'm catching interceptions on you innocent pedestrians, (touchdown) 
 Suckers keep on flexin, I'm bringing out the rice 
 Jody shaking dice watching Miami Vice, Syrup in my Slice 
 That's a given, now I'm the man but I'm crawling like a kitten 
 Teach him 
 Show you how to be man, how to be the boss 
 How to come through with seven coats of the gloss 
 Show you how to be man, show you how to be man 
 Show you how to be man, how to be the boss 
 How to buy the car, how to buy the house 
 Show you how to be man, show you how to be man 
 Packin my luggage, push get to shoving 
 Show Jody loving when I'm flipping candy pumpkin 
 Might hit the club and it's the white Danny Glover 
 Rap game Uncle Ben pulling rice out the oven 
 Now I'm Julius Caesar in the Versace wife beater 
 Would go on vacation but my whole life's a weekend 
 Whole a lotta money, all bills paid 
 Next pay day I'm buying 3 or 4 chains 
 Now I'm picture perfect, shoulda been a surfer 
 Aww shit look who it is, it's the white Eddie Murphy 
 Big balling, no stopping 
 Trunk steady knockin', floatin through the sky 
 M-M-Mary Poppins
