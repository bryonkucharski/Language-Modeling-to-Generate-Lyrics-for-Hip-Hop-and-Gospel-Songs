Hit me up 
 Where you wanna go 
 We can drive downtown 
 Just cruising slow 
 Got fifty in the tank and a pocket full of cash 
 Got no where to be tonight 
 We can take our time 
 Just rolling slow, rolling slow 
 First off pay all your taxes 
 Accountant doing back flips, pockets doing gymnastics 
 Dropped off my 40% to Uncle Same 
 Damn fam, can I cop the cramb Lamb 
 I must vacation on the regular 
 No behind the scenes, put away your cellular 
 No phone service in Amsterdam 
 Don't touch my hand, I buff shine my nails 
 Three shots of green tea, Vietnamese TP 
 Drop my hotel key in Japanese seaweed 
 My feet need to meet the beach in East Greece 
 My body needs to sleep beneath Versace sheets 
 Hit me up 
 Where you wanna go 
 We can drive downtown 
 Just cruising slow 
 Got fifty in the tank and a pocket full of cash 
 Got no where to be tonight 
 We can take our time 
 Just rolling slow, rolling slow 
 Never meant to get bent out of shape 
 But I ate too many steaks, put on too much weight 
 Gained seventy pounds, you could see it in my face 
 Lean down, I could barely tie my shoe lace 
 RiFF RaFF, I came back with Versace six pack 
 Don't get side tracked, tryna keep up with my stacks 
 Might spill through Nashville with my wrist on chill 
 Set my ... 
 Back to me, back to doing whatever I feel 
 Back to you being annoying and keeping it real 
 With your attitude I swear I've had it up to here 
 I be damned if I let these haters get in my ear, RiFF 
 La-la-la 
 La-la-la-la-la 
 Ooh, la-la-la-la-la 
 Hit me up 
 Where you wanna go 
 We can drive downtown 
 Just cruising slow 
 Got fifty in the tank and a pocket full of cash 
 Got no where to be tonight 
 We can take our time 
 Just rolling slow, rolling slow 
 Hit me up 
 Where you wanna go 
 We can drive downtown 
 Just cruising slow 
 Got fifty in the tank and a pocket full of cash 
 Got no where to be tonight 
 We can take our time 
 Just rolling slow, rolling slow
