Yeah girl, you all right 
 Let me fuck your friend, I might stay the whole night 
 I know it ain't traditional, but this is what I like 
 I'm talking two girls, one pipe 
 Two girls, one pipe 
 On the back of my Ninja bike, heading back to the Hampton's 
 Ain't no romancing, a lot of dirty dancing 
 Gotta go campin' for you to light my lantern 
 You can't leave your friend abandon, don't leave her stranded 
 Pull down her panties 
 I slap her ass, leave a hand print 
 Thong, Victoria Secret 
 If I tell you a secret, can you keep it 
 I like the way you speakin', y'all should stay the whole weekend 
 I fucked her, left her leakin' 
 Versace mattress was squeakin' 
 While I'm fuckin', you could eat it 
 You next, so no sleepin' 
 About to jump out the deep end 
 Next week you should bring three friends 
 Yeah girl, you all right 
 Let me fuck your friend, I might stay the whole night 
 I know it ain't traditional, but this is what I like 
 I'm talking two girls, one pipe 
 Two girls, one pipe
