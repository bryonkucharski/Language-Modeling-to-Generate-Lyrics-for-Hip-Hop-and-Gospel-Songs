Show you how to be the man, how to be the boss 
 How to come through with seven coats of the gloss 
 Show you how to be the man, show you how to be the man 
 Show you how to be the man, how to be the boss 
 How to buy the car, how to buy the house 
 Show you how to be the man, show you how to be the man 
 Show you how to be the man, how to be the boss 
 How to come through with seven coats of the gloss 
 Show you how to be the man, show you how to be the man 
 Show you how to be the man, how to be the boss 
 How to buy the car, how to buy the house 
 Show you how to be the man, show you how to be the man 
 I could show you how to be the boss 
 I could show them boys how we ride on that North 
 So clean top off, looking good 
 Still comin' down tippin' fours through the hood 
 Whipping on the wood in that cocaine Mercedes 
 Could buy another Mulsanne if I sold my chain 
 Old school Y-frame seven coats of the gloss 
 Thugga been the boss since I left Swisha House 
 Break 'em off 
 Top Texas, dry slabs breakfast 
 Wake up everyday to bad bitches and wretches 
 Boss Life, better get your money right 
 Me and RiFF RaFF pouring fours in the Sprite 
 With your bitch, burning bowls after light 
 Paul Wall called to say it's going down tonight 
 H-Town, North Side Thugga 
 I could show you boys how to hustle 
 Show you how to be the man, how to be the boss 
 How to come through with seven coats of the gloss 
 Show you how to be the man, show you how to be the man 
 Show you how to be the man, how to be the boss 
 How to buy the car, how to buy the house 
 Show you how to be the man, show you how to be the man 
 Yeah a chain with the charm, Versace car alarm 
 Roll though your city smelling like a thunderstorm 
 Teleport to Prom, python on my arm 
 But don't get me wrong I want the world in my palm 
 Call like inform, I'm crawling like a baby 
 Pop trunk on Antoine, I let it down in Katy 
 The candy grey Mercedes, I sold it at an auction 
 Rap Game Sadie Hawkins, got a ticket for jay-walking 
 If I had a option, I'd pick all of the above 
 Oriental rugs and I'm flier than a dove 
 You could show me love, or you can get lost 
 Four-story houses, I recline on Prada couch 
 Shark grill in mouth, better watch your language 
 Paul Wall and Johnny got me frozen like a penguin 
 Colder than a polar, Jody Husky sandals 
 Slide down 45 in the black licorice Lambo 
 Show you how to be the man, how to be the boss 
 How to come through with seven coats of the gloss 
 Show you how to be the man, show you how to be the man 
 Show you how to be the man, how to be the boss 
 How to buy the car, how to buy the house 
 Show you how to be the man, show you how to be the man 
 I show you how to get muddy on sunny day 
 Drop a soma in your soda if you want to play 
 Pour a four in a twenty like a shot clock 
 48 for the watch, hundred dollar socks 
 Getting money is an understatement 
 I pay the Corvette for the matching bracelet 
 Half a million worth of jewelry, it's high maintenance 
 Even full of more meds than a cancer patient 
 I could show you how to grind like a brake pad 
 I got a hundred acre island with a helipad 
 No key, start the car with an iPad 
 Drink stains on my shirt is the new fad 
 Shit don't stink, underwear made of mink 
 Big Moe, purple soda, ain't never pink 
 Have you ever mixed a two-liter with the pint? 
 I could show you how to drink till you faint 
 Show you how to be the man, how to be the boss 
 How to come through with seven coats of the gloss 
 Show you how to be the man, show you how to be the man 
 Show you how to be the man, how to be the boss 
 How to buy the car, how to buy the house 
 Show you how to be the man, show you how to be the man 
 Show you how to be the man, how to be the boss 
 How to come through with seven coats of the gloss 
 Show you how to be the man, show you how to be the man 
 Show you how to be the man, how to be the boss 
 How to buy the car, how to buy the house 
 Show you how to be the man, show you how to be the man
