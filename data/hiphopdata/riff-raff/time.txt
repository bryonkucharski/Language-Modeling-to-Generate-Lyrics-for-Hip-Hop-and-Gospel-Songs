It's called time people and 
 If you don't slow down and 
 Realize what you're doing 
 You might lose everything 
 'Cause time goes by 
 It goes on 
 And it don't stop 
 I said time goes by 
 It goes on 
 And it don't stop 
 Sometimes I feel, feel like my time has passed 
 Like I'm an hourglass, and the sand is moving fast (moving too fast) 
 In this life I live, my dad is my best friend 
 But it seems like I never call him, when I need some money 
 The people around me, I mean the ones that I do have 
 It's like they're here today, they'll probably be gone tomorrow 
 When its raining hard, and my car breaks down 
 I got no one to call on, except triple-A 
 'Cause time goes by 
 It goes on 
 And it don't stop 
 I said time goes by 
 It goes on 
 And it don't stop 
 Here we go again, in my life all alone again 
 I got no wife, I got no kids 
 No one to come home to, no one to cook for me 
 And when I'm sick, it's a catastrophe 
 My days are slow, and my nights are cold 
 And to go to sleep I gotta keep the TV on (love my TV on) 
 My ex still calls me up, she asks if I'm doing fine 
 But she has a daughter (how am I gonna be fine?) 
 And the baby ain't mine 
 'Cause time goes by 
 It goes on 
 And it don't stop 
 I said time goes by 
 It goes on 
 And it don't stop 
 Do all my time up on this earth they told what I couldn't make (what I couldn't make) 
 And I gotta put it in their face (put it in their face) 
 Was all my grind just a waste of time? 
 I think that they're hearing me, but they don't wanna really deal with me 
 Through all these years, from what I've seen 
 I've had friends steal from me, the same ones who lived with me 
 When I got grown and dropped out of school 
 Nobody was broke with me, but now they all wanna roll with me 
 'Cause time goes by 
 It goes on 
 And it don't stop 
 I said time goes by 
 It goes on 
 And it don't stop
