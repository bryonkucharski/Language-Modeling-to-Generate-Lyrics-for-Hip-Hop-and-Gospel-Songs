Hey everybody, this is the moon talking to you 
 I'm calling in from outer space, it's a pretty far distance 
 But I, I figured I'd reach out and talk to you 
 This is Jody Three Moons talking to you 
 Now, there's a lot of problems in people's eyes 
 And there's a lot of bad things, and a lot of good things 
 Sometimes the bad things seem to outweigh the good things 
 But it's not always gonna be like that 
 There's some memories we can't get back 
 Some of the good cherished memories that we just can't remember 
 Where do they go? 
 This is the moon talking to you, it's the actual moon 
 I want you to be nice to everybody you're around 
 And it's okay to just go ahead and let them tears fall like waterfalls 
 Like Versace little rain drops 
 You close your eyes and you dream about a better place 
 This is the moon talking to you, simply the moon
