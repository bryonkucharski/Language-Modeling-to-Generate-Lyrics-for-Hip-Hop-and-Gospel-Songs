Tip-toeing in my Jordans 
 I done came down 
 Tip-toeing in my Jordans 
 Just copped a Porsche 
 Tip-toeing in my foreign 
 You motherfuckers borin' 
 You sleeping on me, snorin' 
 Don't worry, 'cause I'm... 
 What's up to my partners, what's up to my haters 
 I done fucked around and sang a hook like Anita Baker 
 Neon Icon, 57 city tourin' 
 I'm first class to Spain, you still buying Ralph Lauren (Polo!) 
 Might rock huaraches in a photo, Porsche big body 
 My shirt say Versace, TV screen in my left pocket 
 I'm from California, but I done moved to Texas 
 My bad, I'm dyslexic in a four-door mango Lexus 
 At the titty bar, I ain't afraid to tip em 
 Me and Sergio throwing pesos at some strippers 
 Still rocking Js, still fuck minimum wage 
 I just left neon rave, tip-toeing through my batcave, 'cause I'm... 
 Tip-toeing in my Jordans 
 I done came down 
 Tip-toeing in my Jordans 
 Just copped a Porsche 
 Tip-toeing in my foreign 
 You motherfuckers borin' 
 You sleeping on me, snorin' 
 Don't worry, 'cause I'm... 
 Tip-toeing in my Jordans 
 Waking up at the crack of dawn, webcam recordin' 
 All my girlfriends gorgeous, you probably can't afford them 
 My Brazilian twins got flagged and deported 
 This one's for them ballers who be rocking fresh Jordans 
 Security gate, finger scan, panther on the porches 
 Back door open, Otis pulled up in a Lotus 
 Used to drive a Focus but we're still rocking Jordans 
 California rolled shrimp, temporal 
 I'm rocking seven rings like my last name was Jordan 
 I'm at a slumber party, girls only, got you mad 
 But you can sleep outside, here's my Versace sleeping bag 
 Tip-toeing in my Jordans 
 I done came down 
 Tip-toeing in my Jordans 
 Just copped a Porsche 
 Tip-toeing in my foreign 
 You motherfuckers borin' 
 You sleeping on me, snorin' 
 Don't worry, 'cause I'm...
