 A solid foundation the nation 
 Believe this shit started in the basement 
 My uncle that died is a Mason 
 You see all the looks on my faces 
 I see all them racks on ya' cases 
 We send them to a better place 
 We send them boys to meet their maker 
 I'm goin' up skyscraper

 Your kids seen me on cable, and 
 I'm drinkin' syrup, nigga maple (lean) 
 Hurry up where the gates at 
 She ain't nothin' I can't cake that 
 This is only where the apes at 
 All you lame niggas stay back (move) 
 Switchin' lanes in the Maybach (skrt) 
 Hit the motor like a play back 
 Brand new Rollie and the face black

 Some head from your baby mama
