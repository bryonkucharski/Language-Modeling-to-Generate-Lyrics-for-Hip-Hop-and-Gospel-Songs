I was riding on a bike 
 On a very late night

 Child on the front 
 Child on the bike like we livin' overseas

 I remember I had my first toddler 
 Nothin' changed, I remember I had my third toddler

 Free lil Unfunk he got an urg doctor (my brudda!) 
 I ranned off on some of my cursed doctors 
 Dropped the racks right on 'em like a girl got 'em

 And if I like 'em and you love 'em they deserve partners 
 You left a bag for me to see 
 You left a bag and now you hurt me
