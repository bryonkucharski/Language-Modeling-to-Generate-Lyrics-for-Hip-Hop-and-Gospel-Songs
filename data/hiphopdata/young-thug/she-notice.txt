The beat is produced by my nigga Wheezy 
 That's one of my newest engineers... 
 I mean, one of my newest producers 
 I'm high, sorry 
 I pulled up outside in that new big coupe body Benz 
 When I dress myself I'm the topic, yeah the trend 
 Unlike a needle I don't never wanna see the pen 
 Pile all my yays and I better not never see the lens 
 Fresh start, I wanna play, baby 
 Come love a boss, you my babe, baby 
 I'm eatin' like I ain't ate 
 And I'm workin' like a maid 
 Come through, won't you see me with my lenses 
 I'ma trap it, pitch it, I'ma I press it, then I tint it 
 I got falcons in the Honda Civic, I'ma get it 
 I got dolphins in the fuckin' fender and they bending 
 Help me eat 
 Baby don't let me sit here and bleed 
 I got Halloween, trick or treats up my sleeve 
 You can't Future me because she know this me 
 She know this me, she notice me 
 She know Young Thugger Thugger 
 She notice me, she notice me 
 She know Young Thugger Thugger 
 She notice me, she notice me 
 She know Young Thugger Thugger 
 She notice me, she notice me 
 She know Young Thugger Thugger 
 I don't know too many bitches that know I write 
 Hand on me, suck on my dick 
 I'ma pull my dick straight outta my boxers 
 Then she gon' start suckin' like ticks 
 She be the truth when she suckin' that dick 
 And she wanted my milk like a W.I.C 
 She don't play games and she don't go no kids 
 But lil mama say that I'm it 
 Ice is drippin' like a faucet 
 I am hotter than a Taki 
 Fifth pocket, look like a wallet 
 Woah, woah no Kemosabe 
 I got Ms like talkin' Miley 
 And I'm still hot like a pocket 
 Baby girl suck on my balls like a basket 
 Get a nigga out of dental, tragic 
 Lil mama my money stretch like elastic 
 No rubber, I might just use plastic 
 I'm a real boss, I'ma fuck her and leave her in dirt 
 Like a muh'fuckin' Maverick 
 And I got lucky, I'm lucky muh'fucka 
 I might just go play for the Celtics 
 I'ma run up with no helper 
 If I get dealt with, get dealt with 
 Bitch I'm a muh'fuckin' killer 
 Earring bigger than a pillow 
 Eat your main bitch like a Skittle 
 Buy my Burberry at Dillard's 
 Boy you know that you not realer, a thriller 
 Boy you know that you're not built like that 
 Hit you with 3 like Reggie Miller 
 Mama askin' how he kill like that 
 Big old body Benz 
 She wanna fuck me in my big old body Benz 
 She need to suck me in my big old body Benz 
 I won't stop and I won't end 
 I swear, I promise 
 I pulled up outside in that new big old body Benz 
 When I dress myself I'm the topic, yeah the trend 
 Unlike a needle I don't never wanna see the pen 
 Pile all my yays and I better not never see the lens 
 Fresh start, I wanna play, baby 
 Come love a boss, you my babe, baby 
 I'm eatin' like I ain't ate 
 And I'm workin' like a maid
