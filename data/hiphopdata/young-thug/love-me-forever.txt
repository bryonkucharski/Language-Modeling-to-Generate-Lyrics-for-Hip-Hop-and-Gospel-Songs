I want you to love me forever 
 I want you to love me forever 
 I want you to love me forever 
 I want you to love me forever 
 She let me ride it like a caravan baby 
 I swear I need you to come lay right there with me 
 She say she down and she gon' lay and care for me 
 I don't know why she like the air that I'm breathing in 
 Baby, breathe in with me 
 You make me go brazy, I know you won't judge me 
 You might turn to wifey, give you wife things and babies 
 I want you to love me forever 
 Baby you know that I came here for your destiny 
 She wanna drop it if she can, if she can baby 
 She wanna rock it with her hand, yeah a marriage 
 She want it heavy like a bear 
 I told her drop that shit right here 
 I cut that pussy, barber chair 
 Then I'm goin' off in the air 
 Shine it up then bounce it, climbing in it just like a mountain 
 My bankroll big like a bouncer, spitting game like a counselor 
 Big old cross like a pastor, pop that pussy like a Snapple 
 Bitch I'm bleeding, where the napkins? 
 Body red like an apple 
 Screaming free my brothers, I still sleep with my mother 
 Last week I made a quarter, plus I still respect others 
 I can't believe it's not butter, that little bitch might be my supper 
 I get respect from her brother, crenshaw boolin, Nipsey Hussle 
 Still prepared for them arrest, YSL we goin' wrestle 
 Chanel pouch on my left, fuck the cops we don't play 
 Benjamins, Grants talk back, I be like "who is that?" 
 They be like "where you at?", meet at the Valet at Sax 
 I want you to love me forever 
 Baby you know that I came here for your destiny 
 She wanna drop it if she can, if she can baby 
 She wanna rock it with her hand, yeah a marriage 
 I want you to love me forever 
 I want you to love me forever 
 Until we meet each other, oh 
 I want you to love me forever 
 Love me forever 
 I want you to love me forever 
 She love my life and she don't care 
 I flood my bitch and I don't care what they say about it 
 You just a diamond in the mine and you dirty 
 I like my bitches brown like James, no Worthy 
 Scratched out the alphabet, 'cept B bitch 
 Whoa, she standing naked bookin' bhicken 
 Whoa, I need them thick thighs on my chicken 
 You know, just got dropped off by Scotty Pippen 
 Whoa, and I just wanna be loved
