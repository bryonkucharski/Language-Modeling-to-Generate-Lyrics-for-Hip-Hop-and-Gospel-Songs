Ay yo nephew 
 I think it's time to put some of that real sticky-icky-icky in the motherfuckin' air 
 But in a Backwood, ya dig? 
 I wanna get high, yeah 
 'Bouta go call my go-to guy, yeah 
 Got no Backwoods, fly yeah 
 I could break one down with my supplies, yeah 
 Roll up some gas, I'm not talkin' a car 
 Shawty she bad, fuck 'round take her to the stars 
 Brand new dash, I got brand new cash 
 Brand new chick, got her brand new ass 
 Give the password, psych 
 'Bout to drink a whole lot of syrup, aight 
 But the Bentley coupe missing, the stash on the curb 
 Watch the city go missing, the young nigga ran off with lil biddy birds 
 Fuck you talkin', bitch you ran off on 'em 
 How these lil handcuffs and you cops can't cuff me 
 In the back of the cab, this ho sucking dick from the front seat 
 This her aftermath, like I got 50 Cent on me (straight stacks) 
 Trap spot's like a store 
 Nigga got a couple choppers on the floor 
 Watch that door (watch that door) 
 Watch that door (you gotta watch that door) 
 Watch that door 
 I roll up two point fives 
 Happy four twenty, roll up two point fives 
 Way too stoned, don't remember these guys 
 Hold up, so high I'ma risk my life, ain't even tryna go to these skies 
 Hold up strollers 
 I want the whole cut 
 I make a slut slut 
 I eat it cold cut 
 Hair getting longer 
 Weed getting stronger 
 'Bout to strong arm her 
 'Bout to go and bone girl 
 She got a cameltoe, I call her Marlboro 
 I take you from the stars, take you to my world 
 But she didn't get a chance to get my number 
 She missed out on llama, she missed out on me and my mama 
 I wanna get high, yeah 
 'Bouta go call my go-to guy, yeah 
 Got no Backwoods, fly yeah 
 I could break one down with my supplies, yeah 
 Roll up some gas, I'm not talkin' a car 
 Shawty she bad, fuck 'round take her to the stars 
 Brand new dash, I got new cash 
 Brand new chick, got her brand new ass 
 With a lot of old money 
 Everybody want somethin' from me 
 Got to keep my hands on the steering wheel 
 'Cause I foot the bill and I shoot to kill 
 And I slide around in that Snoop DeVille 
 And my gas tank is on full 
 Stack goods, them Backwoods 
 We cock back and we pull 
 Bubblegum, cookies, OG, and KK 
 We like Craig and Dae Dae, who gives a fuck what they say? 
 I be out here gettin' it, gotta get it 'cause I got it on 
 I'm the same nigga that you bitch niggas plotted on 
 It ain't as easy as I make it look 
 See what I'm sayin', I ain't playin', nigga take a look 
 We on that G shit, nigga we lit, and I'm seasick for real 
 Thugger Thug, what it does, let's get this motherfuckin' money 'cause 
 I mean that new money, that blue money with new faces 
 Them new cases and new bases and new aces 
 Florida-anapolis, ain't no stoppin' us 
 Power preaches patience 
 Balling in two places 
 Exchanges, smoke faces 
 Count this money on a PJ in my PJs 
 Goin' fast, get in tussles on the E-way 
 Smoking on that OG 
 I fell on my AP, got me a Rollie 
 I got a bad bitch and I call her dopey 
 And her head dope 
 And she suck me off the perky, keep her hands off 
 I don't fuck with vapors but I'm high-igh-igh 
 I got a bad bitch, I know she bi-i-i-i-i 
 I wanna get high, yeah 
 'Bouta go call my go-to guy, yeah 
 Got no Backwoods, fly yeah 
 I could break one down with my supplies, yeah 
 Roll up some gas, I'm not talkin' a car 
 Shawty she bad, fuck 'round take her to the stars 
 Brand new dash, I got new cash 
 Brand new chick, got her brand new ass 
 See man, a lot of you niggas think you can smoke with us 
 But umm 
 This shit is a marathon man 
 This ain't no motherfuckin' umm, hundred yard dash 
 Man step back 
 You ain't in our league 
 Thugger Thug, Doggy Dog 
 Nephew we on
