Nigga, turn up 
 It's GuWop 
 Trap house bunkin' 
 Trap house mansion 
 Yeah, right on Flat Shoals Exit, nigga 
 I'm pourin' fours and shit, I need to just put a duce in 
 Car cost four-hundred-thou' and I put a roof in 
 My nigga pot cook it so good he put his shoe in 
 Nigga, it's a gangsta party, why fuck is you in? 
 Head bust a microwave, shit, didn't take him two minutes 
 You know that there's some straps in the club, they let my crew in 
 I might just do the Michael Vick man and cook it left hand 
 If you ain't talkin' 'bout buyin' grams then I'm a deaf man 
 I can make the dope do numbers, the Stacey Augmon 
 I told my bitch to dye her hair red like Dennis Rodman 
 If Gucci Mane got so much money then why he robbin'? 
 We thirty deep, we come from the streets, nigga, we mobbin' 
 (It's Guwop), again 
 Thugger and Guwop, again 
 Chasin' that Guwop, again 
 That's my lil whoadie, again 
 We chasin that money baby, again 
 We fuckin' your hoe, again 
 And if you owe me baby, go head and show me baby 
 Pull up and pour it 
 I'mma go gold, let you know it 
 I got gold on my rolex 
 And I'm real bright like a poet 
 I look like a dope boy, I know it 
 I know I'm gonna win it like Floyd 
 I became an important lil' boy 
 Money long like a sock with some shorts 
 My bitch white and she brown like port 
 Ed-umacation abort, bookin' these dorks 
 I jumped off the porch and went north 
 Whipped you some dope full of narc-cotics 
 YSL hardbody, I got 'bout 20 chickens in the lobby, baby 
 Ride It, ride It Kawasaki, saki 
 I don't speak English I 
 I fuck that mouth, I'm not sexist 
 I'm the big homie, I'm leakin' 
 Stick to the streets like I'm cement 
 I don't need no change, you can keep it 
 I don't want your verse on my remix 
 No panties she my secret 
 Got a hunnid bands on me I'm cheesin' 
 This the sequel, lookin' down like an eagle 
 (It's Guwop), again 
 Thugger and Guwop, again 
 Chasin' that Guwop, again 
 That's my lil whoadie, again 
 We chasin that money baby, again 
 We fuckin' your hoe, again 
 And if you owe me baby, go head and show me baby 
 Pull up and pour it 
 I'mma go gold, let you know it 
 I got gold on my rolex 
 And I'm real bright like a poet 
 I look like a dope boy, I know it 
 I know I'm gonna win it like Floyd 
 I became an important lil' boy 
 Money long like a sock with some shorts
