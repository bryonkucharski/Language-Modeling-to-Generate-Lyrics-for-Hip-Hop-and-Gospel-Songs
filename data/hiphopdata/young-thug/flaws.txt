I be the Thugga 
 Who are you? 
 I don't know, I don't know 
 Ay, ay 
 Rosé goin' right inside the kitchen 
 I might be a lame if I don't pay that ho tuition 
 I find out like two weeks ago that I was pimp 
 I don't stack that shit by the four 'cause I'm not a shrimp 
 Man I do it, put that shit on everything she know I do it 
 Fuck that work I might not do it (sike!) 
 Like my daddy or the school, I might listen to it 
 My clothes they by Elizabeth Taylor baby 
 Fuck on your lil bitch and get to moving with the skaters baby 
 I can go around the bitch like equators baby 
 And I feel free like the mothafuckin' nature baby 
 That lil bitch fit the description like a blazer baby 
 And she from L.A. just like the mothafuckin' Laker baby 
 Imma fire shots off like I know Brian Nichols 
 I just might ride or die for my niggas 
 They talkin' life sentence I'll try with my niggas 
 And I will beat trial with my niggas 
 How you gon' eye my niggas? 
 Tell me, how you gon' try my niggas? 
 How you goin' back and forth 'bout my niggas? 
 Flaws and all my nigga 
 Flaws and all, fell in wit my dawgs 
 Flaws and all, even with my paw 
 Versace drawers for your broad 
 Flaws and all

 Man I do it, put that shit on everything she know I do it 
 Fuck that work I might not do it (Psyche!) 
 Like my daddy or the school, I might listen to it 
 Tell me how you see a nigga take the spots, and knock a nigga straight off his spots 
 I mean how the fuck you think you gon beat the Thugger 
 Defeat the Thugger, Don't bleach Young Thugger 
 I mean how the fuck, you'll need the Thugger 
 You'll please the Thugger, you'll eat the Thugger 
 No leasing Thugger, yeah, No leasing Thugger 
 The bitch so clean it's a shame no one love her 
 Yeah, never love these bitches 
 When I ran my' money up I started duckin' these bitches 
 She eat the dick so much, I ain't never seen the bitch in the mofuckin' kitchen 
 Baby I love you, in a house full of grown folks, baby I love you 
 Swear to God, you my bread and butter 
 You can get my all if the Feds destroy us 
 I'ma keep my feet in these streets 
 Like a "d" we can go straight overseas 
 Put purple in my brain just like a leaf 
 If the bitch got class, yeah she can come with me 
 I ain't gotta tell these hoes, they know I'm prince of the city 
 I just might pull up with bad bitches and take 'em to the trenches
