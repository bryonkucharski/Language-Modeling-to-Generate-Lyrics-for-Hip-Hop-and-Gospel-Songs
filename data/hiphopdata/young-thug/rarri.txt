Got a Rarri with the engine in the back 
 Every neighbor know a nigga servin' crack 
 Chasing cheese, but I can not be a rat 
 Screamin' free Gucci Mane, no Mack 
 I just finished doin' some business with the hat back 
 I'mma take a nigga head like a snatch back 
 I'mma hit her with this wood, no mouse trap 
 Take a five hour rest, ball it cat nap 
 Treat her like a Bentley, take the top up off that bitch 
 I got hoes drinkin' syrup like a waffle on that dick 
 I made all my pockets grow like Pinocchio, lil bitch 
 Either way, money'll grow, just know I'm tryna get rich 
 Baby, I wanna cashout on you in it for my pride 
 Baby, I bought that Audi and I gave it to my mother 
 These niggas, they cowards, they won't even kill each other 
 Even though I got rhymes, I bust shit just like a bubble 
 Hey I ran up my racks and I'm killin' 'em by the day 
 Treat her like she got tatted, she comin' with all that head 
 Not a big fan of acne, but she like it in her face 
 I'm in the West Coast bangin' like I'm in the A 
 Got a Rarri with the engine in the back 
 Every neighbor know a nigga servin' crack 
 Chasing cheese, but I can not be a rat 
 Screamin' free Gucci Mane, no Mack 
 I just finished doin' business with the hat back 
 I'mma take a nigga head like a snatch back 
 I'mma hit her with this wood, no mouse trap 
 Take a five hour rest, ball it cat nap 
 I just copped the coupe, it came with twin turbo 
 Diamonds 'round my neck, they singin' like they Kirko 
 Thugger got me swung, got drinkin' all this purple 
 And I got 'em billionaires in my circle 
 So you know I'm bangin' back up in the Rarri 
 I got old money like when I played Atari 
 Counted me a million on my DVD 
 Coca, cocaina, I got recipes 
 Really makin' juggs, I was servin' 
 Cash Money, nigga, I know Birdman 
 I just want the cheddar, I just want the pesos 
 Rich Gang, YSL, came up off that yayo 
 Got a Rarri with the engine in the back 
 Every neighbor know a nigga servin' crack 
 Chasing cheese, but I can not be a rat 
 Screamin' free Gucci Mane, no Mack 
 I just finished doin' business with the hat back 
 I'mma take a nigga head like a snatch back 
 I'mma hit her with this wood, no mouse trap 
 Take a five hour rest, ball it cat nap
