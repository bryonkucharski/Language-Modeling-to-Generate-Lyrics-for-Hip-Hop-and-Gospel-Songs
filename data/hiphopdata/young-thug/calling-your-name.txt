You know we can get away 
 Because I'm calling your name 
 You know we can get away 
 You know we can get away 
 Because I'm calling your name 
 I'ma hit it, never pass it 
 Booty fat like she eat asses 
 You can't see? You need glasses 
 They can't see me like masks 
 I know a way, I know I need it 
 I won't misread it, specs on when I treat it 
 House on my face when it's real 
 I'll share my place when it's real 
 Promise me that you won't squeal 
 I am your doctor, your Phil 
 Suck this dick, peppermint, hey baby 
 I see you're far... far, baby 
 Hercules, Hercules 
 I feast on you, you nurse on me 
 I love your stones and they phony 
 I'm drunk on her, she all on me 
 Hey the slang, girl you the business 
 I'm hungry, eat her like Denny's 
 I'm just Hannah Montana 
 Their jewelry's sunny, yours windy 
 Every day I see you, I wan' fuck you by the pound 
 I came to the town, discovered it, lost and found 
 Baby you know I am the one that you want right now 
 I need to cuff whenever I beat it up or down 
 She callin' me Jeffery 
 I protect her like a seatbelt 
 Nigga, money stacked up like 3 shelves 
 Run my older hoes off, keep her feet there 
 By myself, I'm on the shore, no seashells 
 I hope I'ma ride that bitch like a V12 
 Aye baby girl don't meet me there, beat me there 
 Plus I am a freak like 3 Kels' 
 Pull on up, baby, pull on up 
 Gots you wrapped, baby, Toys R Us 
 I'm livin' that life 
 Baby I'm important like in Pedialyte 
 I'ma put that pussy in saran for yah 
 I'ma pop a Xanny for that ass for yah 
 I'ma play dead, just like a cask on yah 
 I'ma bleed red when I go smash on yah 
 Suck this dick, peppermint, hey baby 
 I see you're far... far, baby 
 I'ma check that bitch up and down in the street 
 Ain't gon' hold my head down when they see me 
 I'm a lion, I'll fuck it, I'm a beast 
 But nigga my water blue like a genie 
 Too much money to go to jail, they can't have a freebie 
 I bring them racks out the shell, bitch you know they're bleeding 
 Too crazy, too crazy 
 Like you could be my baby, lady 
 Three crazy, three crazy 
 I just might come for you like the Navy 
 One crazy, two crazy 
 New coupe Mercedes 
 Hey I'm just like this 
 Too hot, I need a fan, no Tasia 
 She callin' me Jeffery 
 I protect her like a seatbelt 
 Nigga, money stacked up like 3 shelves 
 Run my older hoes off, keep her feet there 
 By myself, I'm on the shore, no seashells 
 I hope I'ma ride that bitch like a V12 
 Aye baby girl don't meet me there, beat me there 
 Plus I am a freak like 3 Kels' 
 Pull on up, baby, pull on up 
 Gots you wrapped, baby, Toys R Us 
 I'm livin' that life 
 Baby I'm important like in Pedialyte 
 I just drink that lean on me, I promise ain't goin' broke 
 When I hit the club, them strippers smile, I give 'em hope 
 I know how it feels to be so broke that you got jokes 
 I know, I know, I know, I know how to get that paper 
 I know, I know how it feels to stack racks up like acres 
 I know, I know how it feels, 2, 000 channel cable 
 Ali-ani-ani got me lookin' like the mayor 
 What you be, Thug? I'm a player 
 And what, Thug? I'm a slayer 
 And what, Thug? I make bail 
 And plus? I won't tell 
 You're a winner, in a Bimmer 
 And what? And I'm drinkin' 4 ounces and liters 
 She callin' me Jeffery 
 I protect her like a seatbelt 
 Nigga, money stacked up like 3 shelves 
 Run my older hoes off, keep her feet there 
 By myself, I'm on the shore, no seashells 
 I hope I'ma ride that bitch like a V12 
 Aye baby girl don't meet me there, beat me there 
 Plus I am a freak like 3 Kels' 
 Pull on up, baby, pull on up 
 Gots you wrapped, baby, Toys R Us 
 I'm livin' that life 
 Baby I'm important like in Pedialyte 
 You know we can get away

 You know we can get away
