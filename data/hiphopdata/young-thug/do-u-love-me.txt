We got London On Da Track 
 Rose gold Rolex, who you are 
 They don't know, who you are 
 Vroom, adiós, I steer a foreign car, ho 
 Shawty mine, finesse her right out a barcode 
 She get clean like Windex when she want to 
 She read a nigga's texts when she want to 
 No tats up on your shirt, she'll never want you 
 Hop out the Benz coupe 
 Fuck me, suck me 
 L-O-V-E, do you love me? 
 In the tubby, poppin' bubbly 
 Smokin' musty, I love me 
 Love, lo-lo-love, love, love, love me 
 Fall deep in love, love, love with me 
 Baby girl come suck me and fuck me 
 Drankin' bubbly, we get thuggish and rugged 
 To the moon, you are 
 Don't you know who we are? 
 These women know who we are 
 Plenty Benjamins on me and my squad 
 When you a prince, nigga, your doors ajar 
 Actin' like you don't know who we are, but you do 
 I know you know who she was 
 Twerk it, babe, real slow, move your hips slow 
 Roll slow, roll slow, move shit 
 Lick your body while I give you a massage 
 Ain't talkin' Nicki, I'm 'bout to have a Ménage à... 
 Trois, on my face, all day 
 Hold up, got a K, 'bout to spray 
 Hold up, bust in her hair, Milky Way 
 Hold up, kick shit, Johnny Cage, yeah 
 Hold up, she the bomb like a damn grenade 
 Hold up, light skate, intake 
 Turnt, outta state, in state 
 Burnt out bitch, stop, ay 
 You need, yeah, lessons, watch, bae (watch bae) 
 You thinkin', yeah, I'm broke, you need to, awake (fool) 
 A hundred, racks, three, a week (cash) 
 Say love the freaks, I count it, like geeks (yeah) 
 It's mounted, with tease 
 I ain't gotta remind these hoes 
 They know who we are 
 Do you know who we are? 
 These women know who we are 
 Plenty Benjamins on me and my squad 
 When you a prince, nigga, your doors ajar 
 Actin' like you don't know who we are, but you do 
 I know you know who she was 
 Twerk it, babe, real slow, move your hips slow 
 Money green like camouflage 
 STD, I'm takin' over your ward 
 Homegirl fine, body smooth and all 
 Planned on havin' more kids than God, damn 
 I draped up her closet, now she look like a Barbie 
 Now my drinks are clean, I fill 'em up with that oil 
 Bumped my self esteem and now I think I'm adored 
 Let me through the door or else I'll come through the walls (walls) 
 I haven't slide in days, for you 
 Treatin' myself like I got AIDS for you 
 I ain't fuck none of these girls like I got AIDS for you, ay 
 I got nine lives, I'll blaze for you 
 I'll set it down in days for you 
 Shawty pubics, shave it 
 Her eyes hazel, too 
 Rose gold Rolex, who you are 
 They don't know, who you are 
 Vroom, adiós, I steer a foreign car, ho 
 Shawty mine, finesse her right out a barcode 
 She get clean like Windex when she want to 
 She the reason nigga's text when she want to 
 No tats up on your shirt, she'll never want you 
 Hop out the Benz coupe 
 Fuck me, suck me 
 L-O-V-E, do you love me? 
 In the tubby, poppin' bubbly 
 Smokin' musty, I love me 
 Love, lo-lo-love, love, love, love me 
 Fall deep in love, love, love with me 
 Baby girl come suck me and fuck me
