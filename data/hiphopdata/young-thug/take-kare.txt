Yamu yamula Babe (Yamu yamula Babe) 
 Rich Gang (We got landing on the track) 
 Boolin' at the basketball game 
 Dressed in Balmain (Fresh) 
 Dropped a hundred on the whole thing 
 Inside cost a whole thing 
 And I'm a, give you my all, first my whole name 
 I'm in her mouth just like Colgate 
 I'm really feelin' super light, aye 
 Hate me 
 Like a hate ladies man, like bait 
 Hop inside a Bentley with a red paper plate 
 Every time they hate I throw them bands like a bouquet 
 I ain't Ray J but you can be my Kim K 
 Feelin' like the flippin' yellow green on like a cape 
 I don't ever believe what Lil Kim say 
 Ballin' how you feel, you can jump in my league 
 Running to my head like a deal in this league 
 Man, everywhere she go, she ballin' 
 Yeah she got xans, she like, "Where Tar at?" 
 She don't gangbang, she say she bang gangs 
 And she'll fight, might knock 'em out the ring 
 Had a coke brick, she'll whip it like a whip 
 I just wanna nut, she say that is easy like a baker 
 She just want a nigga, I don't serve but I love maple 
 And that's why she gon' watch me like cable 
 Take kare of her 
 If I don't do nothin' in the world, swear to God I'm takin' kare of her 
 Take kare of lil mama, take kare of baby mama 
 Take kare of her 
 Take kare of her, take kare of her 
 Take kare of her 
 On a million, goin' to meet a billion 
 Bring the Bentley, you can keep the ceiling 
 Take a trip to Peru, baby suck my dog like Snoop 
 Blood gang, big ups so woo 
 Dinosaur bank roll, woo woo 
 H&M ballin', ball a hundred ten 
 Throw my boy 6, bim bim 
 Baby keep that pussy 
 Baby keep that pussy clean, trill 
 Bought a castle with my last deal 
 Boy don't talk about no fad deal 
 Lil nigga you laaaaaaaaame, okay 
 I'm a put the pedal to the race 
 I'm a pull the pedal, not the brake 
 Ice inside my ring, you can skate 
 Yeah this shit cold like a case 
 That a nigga went and snitched on him with 
 All these mothafuckin' bitch 
 I'm the shit, Hell I'm the shit 
 I'm a build a hole for a snitch, not a ditch 
 Shit 
 They be hatin' on my girl, though 
 And they wish they was the bitch they're hatin' 
 Salutations to my old hoes 
 And thank you for your participation 
 No chasin' from a girl though 
 She go harder than me on, okay 
 Gettin' wasted with my girl 
 Then we 69 till we need ventilation 
 You don't know about it 
 Gotta open new accounts cause the others overcrowded 
 Gotta open up the stores when they're closed when we shoppin' 
 For my girl, wear the clothes that ain't nobody rockin' 
 She so bad, I don't know what to do with her 
 I know just what to do in her 
 Homies hit me up, they said they're goin' out tonight 
 I said I'm with my girl, tonight I can't fuck with you niggas 
 I'm a take kare of her
