Rastafari, smoking on Marley 
 Mama I'm sorry, got it outta order hey 
 Ballin' like I'm Spalding, bitch I'm only startin' 
 Blowing Money, call it ballin', put some rims inside the water 
 Everything I say I do it, Hawks game, Thugger on the wood 
 Eat that jello like pudding, put this log in her life, no wood 
 (Yeah!) 
 Before I leave, I'ma make sure that she would 
 (Yeah!) 
 I won't be a pet, no counseling, I'm goin' make it work 
 I'll shoot but I ain't talking no bird 
 I'm screaming flex, she screamin flirt 
 And now she on me like a perk, my fuckin' weed smell like a turd 
 I just made 10Mill off of merch 
 When I take boost I'm so alert 
 Droppin' my top when I pull up 
 They bring out the block for me (SRKT) 
 Capital J-O-I-N 'cause they know there's no stopping me 
 (Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!) 
 Got my weight up 
 I must've been eating my beef and my broccoli 
 Bossed up young nigga 
 Man I don't hit the mall, they shop for me.

 Running my money up for all my kids and my niggas 
 Bitches don't try me they know I bang red I can't never be 'cause 
 Don't care if you cousin boy it's disrespectful if you call me 'cause 
 I'm havin' toys and them toys no R Us 
 Come get your bitch off my dick, sucking my blood like a tick 
 And I cannot feel her stop it (Yeah) 
 We are the best, dominant, I zipped down my pants 
 She gone snort like a pig, she gone out of control 
 Lil Mama know she got a nigga out of control 
 She know I'ma bring out the sauce just like Chipotle 
 Shawty pussy wet as a ocean and I know it
