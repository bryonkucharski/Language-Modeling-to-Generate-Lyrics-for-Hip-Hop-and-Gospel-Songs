We came a long way and that's why I say 
 'Bout time, 'bout time, 'bout time, 'bout time, 'bout time 
 'Bout time, 'bout time, 'bout time, 'bout time, 'bout time 
 'Bout damn time, I swear to God 
 God damn time, ay 
 I done ran that money up, 'bout time 
 I used to stack a five, now I'm stacking dimes 
 I don't care if none of y'all ain't my kind 
 Your watch cost 5000, you wasted your time 
 And I'm finished, why you still at the line? 
 If you ain't Damu nigga, you must be blind 
 And I ain't turning down, turn down for what? 
 I'ma turn up every time, every time 
 Every time, every time 
 I cop a ten thousand pimp belt 
 I told the bitch she gotta suck and fuck 
 Ooh, in front and back and make her double nut 
 Wrapped up in towel, got out my cat plug 
 I swear to God she wetter than a tub 
 I supply real niggas and they show me love 
 I fuck three, four hoes every time I'm in club 
 Crack pack count, I gotta see these fucks 
 Mommy wassup? No gives, I got kilos 
 She'll cook up a four 
 I wanna be that nigga, my Denali truck stand tall 
 I can't even see these niggas 
 If I wanted to I still couldn't see these niggas 
 'Bout time, 'bout time, 'bout time, 'bout time, 'bout time 
 'Bout time, 'bout time, 'bout time, 'bout time, 'bout time 
 'Bout damn time, I swear to God 
 God damn time, ay 
 I came from the bottom, 'bout time, yeah 
 I know these niggas want fuck with me, 'bout time 
 I'm a footballer bitch, for a long time 
 Came from smoke in the cup, quite a long time, yeah 
 These bitches know I wanna fuck 'em all 
 Young Money shit 
 These bitches know they come round me with no drawers 
 ('Cause what?) I'm on that horny shit 
 This that horny shit, I don't care, I got horns bitch 
 A capella now, I'ma beat your fucking clique 
 I might mail this shit, I won't never tell no bitch 
 All my bitches thin and brown, this that pretzel shit 
 Miss Chelle, Miss Chelle 
 She got bumps and rumps all over BB 
 I buy her CC, then I turn that shit to BB 
 I'm like feed me, feed me, feed me 
 I don't wanna eat ye 
 'Bout time, 'bout time, 'bout time, 'bout time, 'bout time 
 'Bout time, 'bout time, 'bout time, 'bout time, 'bout time 
 'Bout damn time, I swear to God
