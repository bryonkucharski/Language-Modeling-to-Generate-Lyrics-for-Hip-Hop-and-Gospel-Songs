Know what I'm sayin'? 
 It's a bread it, you know, you know, we the bread winners, know I'm sayin'? 
 I need some butter, know I'm sayin'? 
 Shout out to A motherfuckin' B, I got on the AP, shit go together, know I'm sayin'? 
 Forever, ah! 
 I know that I'm making a killing 
 My coupe got them stars in the ceiling 
 My niggas go brazy, no Ritalin 
 AB bitch, I'm all 'bout them Benji's 
 I come through there fresh like John Lennon 
 My wrist a haircut, I'm not kidding 
 They dig all the shit that I'm kicking 
 I just bought my bitch some new titties 
 You take out these pictures, you bogus 
 Wasn't gon' turn your ass until you told it' 
 Wasn't gon' ice your ass down till you folded 
 Kick that bitch off the boat with no notice 
 Nigga jewelry water, need to float it 
 Make some bad bitches fuck my brody 
 I eat crabs, fish, and that Chipotle 
 They got lots of bread, I'ma call Butta 
 Three chopsticks, I paid a stack for it 
 They run me through, I probably got warrants 
 In the back of the 'Bach, ugh 
 Burning OG out of Backwoods 
 Not just dancing, diamonds racing Balmain 
 Lots of fakes allergic to seafood and serve for decoration 
 Lobster never tasted 
 Missed Thanksgiving, I was in Miami 
 I was on ocean, I was on vacation 
 In the Benz speed, 120 racing 
 AB in a Rari, shit was like the Matrix 
 In and out of lanes, weaving in the spaceship 
 I'm flexing, got muscle like Popeye 
 But fight over a bitch, no that is not I 
 I'm him, I'm gon' tell the roof bye bye 
 Then remove the lid at the stoplight 
 With my side bitches at Benihana's 
 Brung her sister, her bestie, her mama 
 Told 'em tab is on me, yeah I got 'em 
 And I pay the bill all in new hundreds 
 Now that is real colorful money 
 Spikes on me, they drip at the bottom 
 She want Thug, and her friend is a toss up 
 I know that I'm making a killing 
 My coupe got them stars in the ceiling 
 My niggas go brazy, no Ritalin 
 AP bitch, I'm all 'bout them Benji's 
 I come through there fresh like John Lennon 
 My wrist a haircut, I'm not kidding 
 They dig all the shit that I'm kicking 
 I just bought my bitch some new titties 
 You take out these pictures, you bogus 
 We gon' turn your ass until you tollin' 
 We gon' ice your ass down till you folded 
 Kick that bitch off the boat with no notice 
 Nigga jewelry water, need to float it 
 Make some bad bitches fuck my brody 
 I eat crabs, fish, and that Chipotle 
 They got lots of bread, I'ma call Butta 
 She say she want a cat 
 So I went bought the Jag 
 And it matches the bag 
 Make these bitches look sad 
 I just dyed my hair grey 
 Like a motherfucking dad 
 And you know that we feastin' 
 I just couldn't get fat 
 Mind fuck 'em when I speak 
 Take the Farrakhan notes 
 My rock wrist is on gold 
 Like the new Audi spokes 
 Niggas scared to they soul 
 When I pull up with folks 
 I'ma take out the trojans put it right in her throat 
 And you know I stay with them AKs and I should've caught 'em 
 Mind fuck 'em, he shouldn't have played 'bout the butta 
 I only play inside the cover 
 Like a kid, make them play with each other 
 And I'm ridin' round with a real bad bitch 
 Oops I meant girl, cover 
 I know that I'm making a killing 
 My coupe got them stars in the ceiling 
 My niggas go brazy, no Ritalin 
 AP bitch, I'm all 'bout them Benji's 
 I come through there fresh like John Lennon 
 My wrist a haircut, I'm not kidding 
 They dig all the shit that I'm kicking 
 I just bought my bitch some new titties 
 You take out these pictures, you bogus 
 We gon' turn your ass until you tollin' 
 We gon' ice your ass down till you folded 
 Kick that bitch off the boat with no notice 
 Nigga jewelry water, need to float it 
 Make some bad bitches fuck my brody

 They got lots of bread, I'ma call Butta

 My niggas go brazy, no Ritalin
