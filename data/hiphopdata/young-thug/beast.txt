 Still wearing flags, bitch I bleed till I'm deceased

 If you knew any better he would've said 'don't break rules' 
 If I didn't know better I would've stayed in a school 
 If that bitch didn't know better I would've of played it in two 
 If I didn't know better I would've crossed out God and went voodoo
