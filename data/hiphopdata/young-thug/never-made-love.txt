Me and her had never made love 'til I fucked her 
 Lil' lil' mama never fell for it 'til I bust her 
 And you a pretty, pretty girl, no cover 
 Fuck you with no rubber 
 Since your family don't like me I'll let shots go at your brother 
 And your body look like gold when we fuck in Versace covers 
 Just because that pussy good, that don't mean that I'ma trust you 
 That crazy bitch stalkin' my brother Thugger 
 She caught me creepin' with my old ho 
 She ran up like "yeah, yeah," I was like "no, no" 
 My lookout man was my right hand but he was wrong though 
 Then I seen some diamonds come off of my neighbor's porch 
 And it was her, she had a Louis Vuitton purse clean as detergent 
 She had the same exact face as my brother's nurse 
 And he in a hearse, I never looked at it for what it's worth 
 So I never made love, never made love 
 I never made love, never made love 
 I never made love, never made love 
 I never made love, never made love 
 I never made love, never made love 
 (Never made love, never ever ever ever made love) 
 I never made love, never made love 
 (I ain't ever made love) 
 I never made love, never made love 
 When she open up, I'ma taste her 
 X out everyone and then erase her 
 I'm sorry for lyin' to your face, yeah 
 I'ma marry her and I bouquet her 
 Leavin' out the house drunk and she stumbles 
 Be all on her mind, she can't even think of 
 She walkin' off, I look at her like cable 
 Boolin' with your partners at a party 
 They don't even know what the fuck love means 
 She say she never waste time on me 
 Yeah that came out of your jaws, baby 
 I heard it, even though I suck it 'til she lockin' up 
 Lockin' up like handcuffs 
 Give me all your time, every day 
 Girl how come we never made love at your spot? 
 'Cause you ain't want your other rich homie be findin' out 
 She want it so I spent 12 thousand on a lil' rug 
 I'm just tryna tell you, ain't tryna make you look low 
 Even though you've never made love, never made love 
 (Never made love, never made love, never made love) 
 She never made love, never made love 
 (Never made love, aye) 
 She never made love, never made love 
 Never made love, never made love 
 Never felt love, never felt love 
 (Never made love, never made love) 
 Well I'ma change that there 
 I just might wake up and buy you everything rare 
 I'm not cheatin' on you no more, I don't care 
 You wanna be with me, I'ma roll the dice now 
 Roll it, I buy a Rollie, I'ma buy that bitch a Rollie 
 That pack keep rollin', I'ma buy that bitch some more shit 
 'Cause I fucked her sister then I fucked on all her cousins 
 Bitch I'm a Blood, you know I fucked on your bousins 
 She smiling in your face, but tellin' me she love it 
 She like the way my pants don't sag even though they're stuffy 
 She won't T.I. on me, she don't care 'bout no money 
 Hey hey, wait, don't leave 
 (Majestic harmonizing) 
 They trip out all the time, tellin' you I'm on some bullshit 
 Parallel parkin' that pussy, they like my motion 
 Put that on my mama, now Stunna know that I'm loaded 
 When my partner see it he stand up like he on Folger's 
 I ain't like that shit so I hit him right in his shit 
 Then I told him, "don't ever do that shit there again" 
 How you feel if I see your ho and fuck on the kid? 
 I'ma catch a body if she leave me, I'm not playin' 
 Yes I said I'm the best and I put that on the red 
 When you make me mad I try to get back and get some head 
 And I know that's wrong but my dumb ass still did it instead 
 Then I put the strap to my own head like boy I'm on one 
 Then I told her don't ever do it again 
 Every guy you look at, I'll turn him to wind 
 Yeah, then I looked up at God like yeah 
 Then I realized I'd never made love, never made love 
 Never made love, never made love 
 Never made love, never made love 
 Never made love, never made love 
 She never made love, never made love 
 Never made love, never made love 
 Never made love, never made love 
 She never ever made love 
 Never made love, never made love 
 Never made love, never made love 
 Never made love, never made love 
 Never made love, never made love 
 Hey, never made love, never made love 
 Never made love, never made love 
 Never made love, never made love 
 Never made love, never made love 
 Never made love
