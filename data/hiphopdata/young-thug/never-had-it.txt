Pussy niggas actin' like they never had shit 
 All these bitches actin' like they never had shit 
 I got a bad bitch, she said she always had shit 
 All these flawless diamonds, yeah they're lookin' glassy 
 Catch that nigga slippin', I'm a do 'em nasty 
 Check out my attire, this expensive fabric 
 We can wrestle just like Randy Savage 
 My jewelry as cold as an attic 
 The kush that I smoke'll blow your lungs out 
 I'm a walk in and clutch it like it's a war house 
 All your bitches that's busted, they live in your house 
 What goes up goes down, my nigga, north south 
 I done ran up them M's without a tour now 
 She done stepped up her game, Christian couture now 
 These niggas thought that they knew it but they don't know it now 
 I swear to God they're pursuin' at all my shows now 
 Hopped out my bed and hopped right in a foreign 
 Bitch don't get close, this a mothafuckin' warning 
 Suck that dick good, I'm the mothafuckin' warden 
 She runnin' away from my weed like it farted 
 She don't wanna swallow so I put it on her neck 
 I beat that pussy up, she loud as a parade 
 I got 1 million but only 10 in the bank 
 I taste a sample, I only buy if it's dank 
 I cook fishscale, and sang to her at the same time like Tank 
 I was born in '91, 23 with a whole lotta stain 
 5 star mothafucka 
 Baby can you feel my pain? 
 All my diamonds need to be drained 
 I got a gangsta bitch that's gon' bang 
 And I got racks up, I can't complain 
 And all my dogs, they're dirty, check for mange 
 And all I gotta do is reserve your brains 
 And I'm a gangsta, my nuts, they gone hang 
 Who said you was straight? Boy you need to be retained 
 Pussy niggas actin' like they never had shit 
 All these bitches actin' like they never had shit

 These niggas thought that they knew it but they don't know it now 
 I swear to God they're pursuin' at all my shows now 
 Took the Rollie off, put the Breitling back on 
 Walk in the room and I cut the lights on 
 Why you spending like that? 'Cause I ain't ever had shit 
 This that real nigga PaperWrap, YSL shit 
 Never loved a bitch but I love money 
 In the church payin' my tithes with drug money 
 Went and got a new plug, got mama a new house 
 And a couple new coupes, that's how a young nigga live 
 Couple bitches, good weed that how a nigga chill 
 Top floor, penthouse, still crackin' seals 
 Them Houston niggas be like, "That young nigga trill" 
 Them New York niggas say that young nigga ill 
 My mama always told me dress to kill 
 My uncle always told me pack the steel 
 That nigga Thugger, that's my mothafuckin' brotha 
 From a motherfuckin' other, I'm a show you how to make magic 
 The fuck is you mad at? 
 Got your bitch dancin' all in my spot with no panties 
 I said, "Bitch where your mothafuckin' man at? 
 Fuck that, where your friends at?" Dammit 
 Sold 50 p's, hold it, have to bag it 
 That little bitch you lovin' on, I been had it 
 Pull up in a new drop, that thang nasty 
 Mama call all my big booty bitches trashy 
 Pussy niggas actin' like they never had shit 
 All these bitches actin' like they never had shit 
 I got a bad bitch, she said she always had shit 
 All these flawless diamonds, yeah they're lookin' glassy
