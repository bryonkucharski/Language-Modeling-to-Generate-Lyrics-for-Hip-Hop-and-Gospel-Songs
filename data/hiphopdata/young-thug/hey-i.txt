 She told me she gon' make me miss her 
 She let me wet her whole lil' ceiling 
 My dick like crack so yeah I'm dealing 
 She gotta love him, Peter Griffin 
 Nut on the front of her head like I'm Eddie Griffin 
 I make it count, I'm a star and she can make a wish 
 I'm going down with her hard till I'm addicted 
 Where the fuck you going girl? I miss you 
 I wanna bang like a pistol

 Brand new rollie I'm living sporty 
 Flood you with gold like a trophy

 Hey, racks keep me up with that Folger's

 I might hit 'em with them bucks just in case he got luck 
 This a Crime Mob lifestyle nigga knuck if you buck 
 Just 'cause I'm in New York with a puck 
 Don't mean you won't get stuck up, up 
 Ay, I might just tell these hoes my secret 
 First I like them red like a demon 
 A purse, every time lil' momma catch me cheating 
 Starburst, I won't eat it unless she creamy 
 I think she ready for a kiddy 
 She told me she gon' make me miss her 
 She let me wet her whole lil' ceiling 
 My dick like crack so yeah I'm dealing 
 She gotta love him, Peter Griffin 
 Nut on the front of her head like I'm Eddie Griffin 
 I make it count, I'm a star and she can make a wish 
 I'm going down with her hard till I'm addicted 
 I, done completed my little mission 
 I, put something in your stomach next to your kidney 
 I, want nothing to do with none of these lil bitches 
 I, want something to do with everything and I'm willing 
 To go to church and ask God there for forgiveness 
 For everything and tell that preacher that I'm gon' remember 
 Him bringing You in my life and that's on my children 
 Fuck all them other hoes talking, they Wendy Williams 
 Now your wrist got ice like December 
 I pour out the paint like Mutumbo

 And, yeah my girl ballin' like Kendra 
 I think she ready for a kiddy 
 She told me she gon' make me miss her 
 She let me wear her whole lil' ceiling 
 My dick like crack so yeah I'm dealing 
 She gotta love him, Peter Griffin 
 Nut on the front of her head like I'm Eddie Griffin 
 I make it count, I'm a star and she can make a wish 
 I'm going down with her hard till I'm addicted
