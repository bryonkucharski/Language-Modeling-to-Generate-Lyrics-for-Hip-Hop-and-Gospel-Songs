Thugga, baby 
 I won't move without my gun, yeah 
 And it's 'cause I'm the one 
 She wanna fuck my charms 
 Hell yeah 
 But I never told her that I wanna be with her 
 And I never told her that I wanna sleep with her 
 And I never told her that she gonna eat with me 
 Only thing I told the girl is she could bleed with me 
 If she don't like it she don't see it 
 And she soft I call her Tempur-Pedic 
 And I can work magic like a genie 
 You can have my son, no Phoenix 
 Ay, lil momma showing me she don't play 
 And she never diss her old boy, no way 
 And I never told her nothing bout bae 
 And every time I leave she want me to stay 
 But she just don't know how to say 
 And that's deep but I could say 
 Anything I want, I run the day, whoa 
 Hand her my taste, cum on her face 
 Drank all her waist, okay, mush it not beat it 
 Kuna Matata I need it, I am a Mufasa genius 
 Baby come fuck for no reason 
 I am the opposite, I'm so the opposite B 
 I'm the opposite baby 
 I know some Haitians and they cookin' babies, um, ay 
 I meet the momma and meet the grandmomma when I wanna fuck the lil' lady 
 She ran my water then cook all my food now I feel like I done fucked a waiter 
 I won't move without my gun, yeah 
 And it's 'cause I'm the one 
 She wanna fuck my charms 
 Hell yeah 
 But I never told her that I wanna be with her 
 And I never told her that I wanna sleep with her 
 And I never told her that she gonna eat with me 
 Only thing I told the girl is she could bleed with me 
 If she don't like it she don't see it 
 And she soft I call her Tempur-Pedic 
 And I can work magic like a genie 
 You can have my son no Phoenix 
 Started from the top then I fucked her little bottom 
 I'ma nut on her booty she a Prada 
 I'm on her institution now I got on my goggles 
 Baby girl get on my boat no Nautica, whoa 
 Grab that dick eight fucking ways like a motherfuckin' octopus 
 I'ma fuck that lil bitch and listen to 2Pac 
 Call the lil bitty bitch when I wanna do her 
 Baby girl I'm hood rich and I put my crew up 
 Leave that bitch in a ditch and they wanna sue us 
 She's a barber, the bitch saying her crew cut 
 Put my dog in your poo butt 
 Laying down law with my Russians 
 No stomach, came out the gutter 
 Where the hell I'll be without my baby 
 When she send me pictures everything's the latest 
 I wanna fuck her without raping 
 And she'll pull up on you, no baby 
 I won't move without my gun, yeah 
 And it's 'cause I'm the one 
 She wanna fuck my charms 
 Hell yeah 
 But I never told her that I wanna be with her 
 And I never told her that I wanna sleep with her 
 And I never told her that she gonna eat with me 
 Only thing I told the girl is she could bleed with me
