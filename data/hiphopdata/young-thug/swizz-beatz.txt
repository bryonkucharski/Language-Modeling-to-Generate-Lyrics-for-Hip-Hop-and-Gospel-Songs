L-O-V-E 
 For life 
 Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love 
 Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love 
 Gotta ride for your team 
 Nigga play you busting 
 And I got me a high self esteem 
 Love, love, love, love, love, love 
 Love, love, love, love, love, love 
 Love, love 
 Big old digits with me 
 Big old Bentley with me 
 Big old bitches with me 
 S gang chino with me with me 
 I got 3 stripes, Adidas with me, with me 
 All of my creatures with me, with me 
 I got some features with me, with me 
 Big racks and that Aether with me, with me (racks) 
 Tote that like it's legal woody, woody 
 I look that shit up 'bout a thousand times 
 This bitch Master P 'cause she 'bout it, 'bout it 
 That boy got cheap rims on a cheap Jeep 
 Just make sure you tell him his hoe a freak 
 I'm sitting at the top of the nose bleeds 
 And I got my gold off of Goldie 
 Work it, twerk it baby, you have to hold me, wait for home 
 Wake up to Young Thug 
 Have you ever been a shot caller? (Have you ever?) 
 Proceed to the room, leave 'em stalkin' 
 Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love 
 Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love 
 Gotta ride for your team 
 Nigga play you busting 
 And I got a high self esteem 
 Love, love, love, love, love, love 
 Love, love, love, love, love, love 
 Love, love 
 Sob, sob, sob 
 That's on me, that's on me 
 That's on me, that's on me 
 Bands on me, bands on me 
 Turn up for the girls 
 Turn up for the boys 
 Turn up for the club 
 Turn up on the drugs 
 Turn up on the molly 
 Turn up on the Xan 
 Turn up on a percy, give it to my man 
 Here, give it to your clan 
 I put on my mink I'm like a lamb 
 Stop trying to impress your fuckin' cams 
 I'm comin' for mine, Uncle Sam 
 I'm turnin' money into power 
 We not from here we need a browser 
 You just squirt, squirt 
 I know you don't want none, coward 
 I'm studyin' like a bookworm 
 I'm tryna count at least a hundred bands (racks) 
 And I wanna just buy some bigger land, yeah 
 Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love 
 Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love 
 Gotta ride for your team 
 Nigga play you busting 
 And I got a high self esteem 
 Love, love, love, love, love, love 
 Love, love, love, love, love, love 
 Love, love
