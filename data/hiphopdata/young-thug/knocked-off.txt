I'm gon' beat that pussy up just like a champion 
 I'm a beast inside these streets like a barbarian 
 Told my baby next February we're married 
 We laughin' at these pussy boys, they're so hilarious 
 I might get him knocked off, pull some spaghetti strings 
 I might get him knocked off for a double sealed pint of lean 
 I might get him knocked off while I pull a bank scheme 
 I might get him knocked off for just tryna join the team 
 Yeah, we roll these bitches like they centipedes 
 We get this money, flip some hundreds then we blow some Gs 
 I gave her life and then I showed her Bs 
 We fucked the world but now we overseas 
 Inside of the car, we stashed a hundred bricks 
 We put it down and hit the town, we 'bout the money trips 
 Wait, the ice is rollin' 'cause we're rollin', bitch 
 Flakes, the dope is colda 'cause we're polar, bitch 
 I answer the call and put her right beside me 
 Two, we 'bout that woop like them brand new Spyders 
 Keep your mouth closed, boy, 'cause we're aim and fire 
 I just might one night her, show love and wife her 
 I'm bangin' green like the lizard in Geico 
 I pull up and wet you, burn your top like Michael 
 I got bullets bigger than fingers in rifles 
 It's big Bs with a hundred Gs in each one of my pockets 
 I'm gon' beat that pussy up just like a champion 
 I'm a beast inside these streets like a barbarian 
 Told my baby next February we're married 
 We laughin' at these pussy boys, they're so hilarious 
 I might get him knocked off, pull some spaghetti strings 
 I might get him knocked off for a double sealed pint of lean 
 I might get him knocked off while I pull a bank scheme 
 I might get him knocked off for just tryna join the team 
 I'm not gon' pass, I'ma smash 'em 
 She want that nut so I blast her 
 My Bentley grey like a pastor 
 Whippin' that snow, no Alaska 
 Good head, she got her masters 
 Shawty a long way from dumb 
 Your money flat like a plasma 
 Good kush, smoke is the bomb 
 I drink that Act while you be drinkin' red 
 I don't fall in love, I run over it instead 
 Hey, babe, bobble, that big ol' head 
 I'm like, "lil baby, I don't know your kid" 
 I keep my pistol I'll give you the lead 
 They 3 deep I call 'em Ed, Edd and Eddy 
 Baby take a picture, that photo cred 
 She make me lean back like a sofa bed 
 I'm gon' beat that pussy up just like a champion 
 I'm a beast inside these streets like a barbarian 
 Told my baby next February we're married 
 We laughin' at these pussy boys, they're so hilarious
