So I just came out the booth to God damn, to hear this, to hear this shit right here 
 And my niggas, nigga just, nigga just said, "bruh I just told them the same shit" 
 That nigga say he just told these girls that, he knew what I was 'bout to say 
 That's crazy, cray-cray, I dig though, you know what I'm sayin'? 
 With a golden shovel, with a iced out AP, plus a Rollie bezel on another level 
 I say bitch what is you thinkin', we Arthur Blankin' 
 Big checks on me and I got ranking, I'm steady ranking 
 Better stop listenin' to these hoes 'fore you start shrinkin' 
 I know I'm a blood, I'm a gang banger 
 I know ain't a bitch but I'm still singin' 
 Mothafuck the rest, they ain't really bangin' 
 I got the real hitters with me and they dangerous 
 You can't find 'em on no camera but they no namin' 
 Wash 'n' powder bae I'm tired, I've been up all night 
 Me and bae Bonnie Clyde, everything we do right 
 Love her vibe, love her vibe, she make me feel so nice 
 She 100, the first day we met, she let me fuck all night 
 Ah-ah-ah, work 
 Do the work baby do the work 
 Tonight baby do the work baby do the work 
 Tonight I wanna chill so you gotta do the work (Rihanna) 
 If you want it you gotta earn it 
 You gotta earn it, you gotta earn-earn-earn it (you have to sound like a dog) 
 If you want it bae you gotta earn it 
 All right, earn-earn-earn it, aye 
 I can tell that you want it baby, I can tell that you need it 
 I can tell that you suckin', fuckin', I can tell you a demon 
 I can tell you a Victoria, baby, I can keep your secret 
 I'ma show you how to win without cheatin', I'ma show you how to beat it 
 Drop top in a hotbox with a big tall demon 
 I'ma let you defeat me, I'ma lead you to victory 
 Like, shoutout to Stevie, but these niggas not seein' me 
 I'm a big dinosaur, B, and these niggas not beatin' me 
 Aye, I'm scared to trust you, I'm scared you'll trick me 
 I done drive by in a armored car but they're still trynna hit me 
 Put 60,000 on my mama ring and it ain't even come out of Tiffany's 
 I can tell you how to get the money but you just gotta listen to me 
 Ah-ah-ah, work 
 Do the work baby do the work 
 Tonight baby do the work baby do the work 
 Tonight I wanna chill so you gotta do the work
