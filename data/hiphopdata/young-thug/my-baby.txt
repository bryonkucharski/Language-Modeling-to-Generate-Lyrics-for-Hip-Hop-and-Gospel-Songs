Okay, lil' mama sharp with a razor 
 Okay, lil' mama fresher than a blazer 
 No way, I cannot fuck it in the anus 
 Hey yeah, baby we get Kurt, no Angle 
 And I got stripes like a Bengal 
 And I can send 'em from every angle 
 Holy ghost with an angel 
 Holy moly mang! 
 I'ma stand up right beside my baby 
 If a pussy nigga play he might just die by my baby 
 Shoulda never tried my baby 
 No we don't die, we multiply my baby 
 Hurry up and sign it my baby 
 It's simple, just sign the dotted line my baby 
 I pull up and ride with my baby 
 New Rollie for my child and my baby 
 Do it like you always wanted 
 Thugger baby, I want your top, head 
 My diamonds are goin' dumb, SPED 
 I'm inside your mouth like gum 
 Experiment, no wreck, I put dents on a bitch 
 I'll buy her mink, not trench, I'm a pimp 
 Big racks got me walkin' with a limp 
 Buyin' Rollies on Rollies like I'm Flavor Flavor's shrimp 
 Versace cover, roll that bitch up like some weed 
 She whip that ass like her name Neff B 
 I got more karats than a cavity 
 Baby don't pull it out of your teeth 
 We go shoppin' at Bal Harbour for the beach 
 Ain't talkin' car but I need her to spoil me 
 And I'ma beat that pussy, concrete 
 Like a mothafuckin' street 
 I'ma feed her my milk 
 Every time I feel tired, I need three hoes like a elf 
 You're a ho, ho, ho; don't care, I'ma keep it all to myself 
 Tie my ties on your belt 
 Wit cha till ya dead and pale 
 I heard someone's there walked in and said 
 Okay lil mama sharp with a razor 
 Okay lil mama fresher than a blazer

 New Rollie for my child and my baby 
 Eli Manning, Peyton Manning throwin' dick in that hole 
 She told me that she love the way I dress, like a prince but I'm a boy 
 I made the chart 
 And like Wayne, baby it's all at the start 
 Girl I'm just startin' with that pussy 
 I eat cha hunny bun ya pussy 
 You have me smilin' when you're lookin' 
 Big ole' round booty soft as cushion 
 Stop talkin', pussy nigga, you a wussy 
 Tryna reach, nigga, he might be bookin' 
 Sprayin' my cologne now we smell just like some cookies 
 And if you suck that dick, don't kiss my jaw or else I'm mushin 
 Daddy time, daddy time 
 Got a room full of big booty bitches, it's my prime 
 Filled with iron, filled with iron 
 I throw some ones, baby catch it like the swine 
 I fill my truck up with nothin' but that diesel 
 I let that MAK-90 vibrate just like a beeper 
 Y'all livin' cheaper, nigga this the sequel 
 I'm laughin' at these pussy niggas like a hyena 
 Okay lil mama sharp with a razor 
 Okay lil mama fresher than a blazer 
 No way, I cannot fuck it in the anus 
 Hey yeah, baby we get Kurt, no Angle
