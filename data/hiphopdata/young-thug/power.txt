We got London on the Track 
 First you get that money then you get that power 
 If he tune his nose up, boy he on that powder 
 Now you walk around with 50 in your trousers 
 Diamonds boolin' on my chest, no fuckin' blouser 
 Bitch, I make it rain shower, ya dig that? 
 They wouldn't know one thing about ya if ya zip that 
 Hit 'em with that blocka-blocka, nigga get back 
 Beat that bid an never crack, did that, sheesh! 
 Before I go without a sack, I swag pack 
 I spoiled my bitch and now she actin' like a brat 
 I met Ellis, I know Jimmy, he got racks 
 Bitch I'm bleedin' like a tat 
 Roll it, roll it, for me on ya back 
 Just for show, my diamonds yellow like a taxi 
 I'm a cat, I'ma take out them pussy rats 
 Pussy nigga better not look back 
 Or, or else I'm killin' 'em, hell yeah, that's a fact sheesh 
 There's blood all on my Timberlands 
 Make a nigga say "whaat?!" 
 I swear to God she feelin' 'em 
 She sucked like eight dicks, I call her Octagon 
 First you get that money then you get that power 
 If he tune his nose up, boy he on that powder 
 Now you walk around with 50 in your trousers 
 Diamonds boolin' on my chest, no fuckin' blouser 
 Bitch, I make it rain shower, ya dig that? 
 They wouldn't know one thing about ya if ya zip that 
 Hit 'em with that blocka-blocka, nigga get back 
 Beat that bid an never crack, did that, sheesh! 
 Bitch, I dig it, I eat ice cream with my chicken 
 Bitch, I'm rich just like a Simmons, not lil Diggy 
 If I got legs, bitch you know I'm gonna get it 
 She got good head, so she welcome to my Bentley 
 Big Bentley in that big Bentley, Bentley 
 Hop out with that semi, 'cause I know these nigga hear me 
 Is you mad bout Instagram on how I keep my pimpin'? 
 You keep that Ace of Spades, I'm sippin' 
 I'm a rocket, rocket, I can't stop it, stop it 
 I'm a GTV, boy, bitch I'm poppin', poppin' 
 I need coke, need coke like "Where the fuck is papi?" 
 If you tryna run off, you know we pop ya noggin' 
 First you get that money then you get that power 
 If he tune his nose up, boy he on that powder 
 Now you walk around with 50 in your trousers 
 Diamonds boolin' on my chest, no fuckin' blouser 
 Bitch, I make it rain shower, ya dig that? 
 They wouldn't know one thing about ya if ya zip that 
 Hit 'em with that blocka-blocka, nigga get back 
 Beat that bid an never crack, did that, sheesh!
