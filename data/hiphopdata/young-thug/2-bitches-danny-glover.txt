 Thugger 
 Stoner Life, YSL 
 Okay, cool, okay, bool, I love her 
 I'mma save her, yes, like Danny Glover 
 I'mma call my papi for her, fuck her mother 
 I pass them a molly, now they kiss each-other (Hot!) 
 Every time I fuck I gotta hit me least like two bitches 
 Boy, that dope been whipped, you need like new wrists 
 Foreign car outside, that bitch got two digits 
 Money stand like eight feet just like two midgets 
 Who the fuck told you that Young Thugger Thugger don't fuck up the beat? 
 I got six cars and I also got rentals and all of 'em tinted 
 No, I'm not Nipsey, not from L.A., but I got keys to the city 
 I fuck it, I suck it, I beat it down, then she beat me to the ceilin' 
 Stoner my lifestyle, I'm livin' too wild 
 I came to make you proud, that money keep her around 
 In love with her head, I can't turn it down 
 Can't wait for my time to come back around 
 She see that you don't got Lil Haiti's style 
 Plus I just seen Snoop on Girls Gone Wild 
 I just bought a Bentley and a bitch came with it 
 Young rich nigga hittin' million dollar licks 
 Balling in New York like a motherfucking Knick 
 You better have them racks, you ever want to hear me spit 
 And everywhere I go I gotta pass like the staff 
 I'm goin' off top like a motherfuckin' lay up 
 357, six shots like Al 
 I left ten bands in a motherfuckin' cab 
 Okay, cool, okay, bool, I love her 
 I'mma save her, yes, like Danny Glover 
 I'mma call my papi for her, fuck her mother 
 I pass them a molly, now they kiss each-other (Hot!) 
 Every time I fuck I gotta hit me least like two bitches 
 Boy, that dope been whipped, you need like new wrists 
 Foreign car outside, that bitch got two digits 
 Money stand like eight feet just like two midgets 
 I knew I was gonna run my money up and everybody didn't 
 All these niggas pussy niggas, tellin' on they partner 
 Hope the pussy nigga get a bigger sentence 
 Pussy nigga play, I'm coming back with the K 
 And I'mma shoot that motherfucker 'til he livid 
 Bitches wanna see a nigga thumb through it fast 
 I'mma name myself Young Thug Attendant 
 100 bands at a time I fronted you bags, but you 
 I don't like using profanity, but the Young Thugger will gut you 
 All of my cups are muddy I fuck my bitches' buddies 
 I just want nut like Buddy, all of my bitches buddies 
 Panamera with the tinted roof 
 All the niggas dogs goin', "Roof" 
 Top notch shawty, nigga ring came with karats 
 Young nigga rich, jewelry colder than the attic 
 If she ain't a virgin, then that bitch is only average 
 I can't even hear ya, baby, get rid of the static 
 I can't learn a bitch, but I learned mathematics 
 I just ball her down whenever she call my pattern 
 Okay, cool, okay, bool, I love her 
 I'mma save her, yes, like Danny Glover 
 I'mma call my papi for her, fuck her mother 
 I pass them a molly, now they kiss each-other (Hot!) 
 Every time I fuck I gotta hit me least like two bitches 
 Boy, that dope been whipped, you need like new wrists 
 Foreign car outside, that bitch got two digits
