Wheezy what the fuck brackin', nigga? 
 I might need Be El Be for this one 
 You dig?! 
 Whoa, we tore up 
 I'm like 'baby don't throw up', if she ever hit the ground 
 Young Thug not pickin' her up, you can Quicker Picker Up 
 'Cause I'm a blood, pass me my bup, try'na come around for help but you gon' (what?!) 
 End up suckin', nothing but dick like whoa 
 Baby girl gon' stay and drop it, no steps but I promise I go up 
 Girl what up? I'm like baby this what's up 
 She under me like a rug, can't go up, yep 
 Trick bitch pull up on me, try'na get these digits 
 How the fuck I love when I never like 'em - ooh 
 Bitch I am a genie, I got hoes in Magic City 
 Even when it's rented, president tinted 
 I need an Aaliyah she gon' rock all on my boat 
 My chain small but only my weed make me choke 
 Hey come here baby girl I want that amateur throat 
 And when I get through I pass it to all of my folks 
 Damn they got my name on the Coke 
 Blackjack got me winning by the boats 
 Shoot dice nigga five deuce four tre 
 And my weed orange like a fuckin' cantaloupe 
 She fuck me then smile in your face, all she ever say is "Oh yeah" 
 Ooh baby girl, pull up and give top, no lotion, she like Olay 
 Hey I don't like 'em black, no spades, no way 
 And I only tell her to hurry and wait 
 Whoa, we tore up 
 I'm like 'baby don't throw up', if she ever hit the ground

 Girl what up? I'm like baby this what's up 
 She under me like a rug, can't go up, yep 
 Bitches comin' round the fuckin' gangsta, think they stupid 
 Pull up in the trenches, smoking loud like a Dually 
 And I know I am the best, bitch, how you do this? 
 And I pulled up on your bitch and the children 
 Damn what the fuck is going on, I am gone, so gone 
 I just spent a band on cologne, I am on, so on 
 And my neighbors call my thick misses Texas Roni 
 They was watchin' me back in the days like a Sony, promise 
 I just bought my son a Bentley for his 'port card 
 All my bitches coming foreign plus they head on 
 These lil' bitches try'na compete then they dead wrong 
 I'ma act just like I'm sleep but I'm dead on 
 Whoa, we tore up
