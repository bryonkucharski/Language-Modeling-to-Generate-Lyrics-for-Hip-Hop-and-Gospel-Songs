Thugger, Thugger, Thugger, baby 
 Mike Will in here, motherfuckin' Ear Drummers, you know what I'm sayin'? 
 I appreciate the love at all times, I promise. Ya digg? Ya digg? 
 I feel special, I feel special 
 Look at my wrist, fingers, ears, look at my neck glow 
 I feel special, I feel special 
 Check out my bitch, check out my peers, keep 'em extra 
 Keep 'em fresh, my diamonds a massive mess 
 She said she not going for that 
 She keep her a Smith and Wesson 
 She keep it so confidential 
 She'll erase you with a pistol 
 My diamonds they got way bigger 
 I bought me a tiger, Tigger 
 My diamonds they shine of course 
 Fuck her with a charlie horse 
 Pull up, let Lil' Dolly bust 
 Four fives in them Calicos 
 My cars sound like Need for Speed 
 My feet on some Mickey D's 
 He clutching, he acting crazy 
 She want Lil' Lucci to leave 
 I told her he can not go 
 He got to stay with me with .44's 
 My Forgis sittin' tall like a rollercoast 
 These fuck niggas slower than rollie-pollies 
 DJ Sky flying higher 
 YSL never tell no choir 
 She want to fuck on my meal like Myers 
 I'm ninja lil' nigga 
 Tell 'em or tell something 
 Walking in with bands on us 
 Big B but Chanel on us 
 Laced up with some L's on us 
 Motherfucker go crazy drop down with the steel on him 
 And I really, really, really can't tell prepare for jail on 'em 
 I feel special, I feel special 
 Look at my wrist, fingers, ears, look at my neck glow 
 I feel special, I feel special 
 Check out my bitch, check out my peers, keep 'em extra 
 Keep 'em fresh, my diamonds a massive mess 
 She said she not going for that 
 She keep her a Smith and Wesson 
 She keep it so confidential 
 She'll erase you with a pistol 
 My diamonds they got way bigger 
 I bought me a tiger, Tigger 
 Pull up in a Tesla 
 And if that shit don't impress her 
 My swagger on special 
 You cuffin' that hoe trying to rescue 
 She on her knees like she want me to bless her 
 I try to get in her drawer like a dresser 
 I fuck that bitch like I'm trying to impress her 
 Look, shout out to Thugger 
 'Cause bitch I'm a thug and they know I'm covered 
 He blood like we brothers 
 You niggas ain't tough you fuck one up we gon' bust like a bubble 
 Balling on them like the Rucker 
 Lollipops, you niggas suckers 
 Keep that MC Hammer you can't touch us 
 My swagger mean as a jerk 
 I'm popping tags like they percs 
 My bitch ain't bad, she the worst 
 One of her bags half a bird 
 Pull out that Audemar, my diamonds water water you would think that I could surf 
 I'm the same nigga had to work 
 And I serve a nigga like Lurch, swerve

 Look at my wrist, fingers, ears, look at my neck glow

 My diamonds they got way bigger

 I got a K and it's special just like it's a cereal 
 I'm looking down on your peasants because I'm the king and I'm the superior 
 You know I got shooters on top of the roof and you think that I'm playing I'm serious 
 I'm on them Percocets and Vicodins 
 I'm adding the money not minusing 
 I got a bad bitch look like Kylie Jenner 
 It's a millionaire club and you not a member 
 We slaying your hoe put that dick up in her 
 Don't try me lil' nigga, I recommend it 
 Fifty thousand for the Audemar Piguet 
 You think about robbing nigga? Better abort the mission like you killing children 
 'Cause I got that semi Grinch, stole Christmas, send shooter through your chimney 
 She fucked the star and tried to keep the condom 
 I fucked that hoe after hours like a Roma 
 Coca-Cola coming from Tijuana 
 My wrists is sick, sometimes I want to vomit 
 Got that pump in my truck, I'm not talking about Donald 
 I want an island bitch, come here Rihanna 
 I got out of jail screaming, "Fuck the 'your honor'!" 
 I feel special, I feel special 
 Look at my wrist, fingers, ears, look at my neck glow 
 I feel special, I feel special 
 Check out my bitch, check out my peers, keep 'em extra 
 Keep 'em fresh, my diamonds a massive mess 
 She said she not going for that 
 She keep her a Smith and Wesson 
 She keep it so confidential 
 She'll erase you with a pistol 
 My diamonds they got way bigger 
 I bought me a tiger, Tigger
