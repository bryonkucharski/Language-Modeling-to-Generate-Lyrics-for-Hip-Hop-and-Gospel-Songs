Aye my brother said he can phone off 
 I'm like, "Nigga which one, nigga? Got bout five or six of them bitches bro" 
 And he can't even hear fool 
 Know what I'm talking bout 
 Got my mind right, now I run through the streets 
 I might take flight, don't care if it's he or she 
 I might make it, Mayweather, just like TMT, ya' digg? 
 And I got Deaf Greg with me 
 Got my mind right and go got it 
 Got my mind right and go got it 
 Got my mind right and go got it 
 Got my mind right and went got it 
 Got my mind right and went got it 
 Got my mind right, you ain't got it 
 Got my mind right, you ain't got it 
 Got my mind right, got it 
 Got my mind right and I swear I went ran up my money 
 I swear to God man I ride with that tommy I roll out the pound, not an onion 
 I swear to God man my diamonds they come from New York and yo shit looking sunny 
 You come with them Backwoods that shit better be wrapped up like muhfucking mummy 
 My brothers on bitches, my brothers on bitches 
 We catch 'em and cut them lil bitches 
 I ride with the semi, my money's no midget 
 Got pints and my muhfuckin' reefer 
 Got 'scale on my plane and it came cross that water 
 I locked up the safe but it's not out of order 
 Bitches they wan' know what's popping, they know that if I pop it they know that she droppin' 
 Come off the top like Eddie Hardy, and they know I bang red like a flower 
 I'm not a christian, I don't go to church, but my front pockets look like a Bible 
 Comin' up listenin' to my raps, I knew I needed one shot like a sniper 
 Got my mind right, now I run through the streets 
 I might take flight, don't care if it's he or she 
 I might make it, Mayweather, just like TMT, ya' digg? 
 And I got Deaf Greg with me 
 Got my mind right and go got it 
 Got my mind right and go got it 
 Got my mind right and go got it 
 Got my mind right and went got it 
 Got my mind right and went got it 
 Got my mind right, you ain't got it 
 Got my mind right, you ain't got it 
 Got my mind right, got it 
 Go and get it just to say you did it 
 My brother deaf, but he moving pigeons 
 Ya' dig what I'mm saying, yeah freaky dig it 
 I really wanna meet her no damn ticket 
 I would love to meet her, I would love to meat her 
 I would love to feast her, I would love to eat her 
 I would love to treat her, I would love to trick her 
 Yeah, all of the above no pistol 
 This shit is serious, Brian Nichols 
 She so delirious, now I miss her 
 I'm slick the bomb like a damn missile 
 Bubble gum booty delicious 
 She got her tongue pierced 
 It's a done mission 
 I'm on a Dom Pérignon mission 
 Leave a pussy nigga soul lifted 
 Geeked out, get my toes pierced 
 Ri-ribbit like a toad listening 
 Big nose pinocchio bitch 
 IPhone, she cordless 
 I got big diamonds in my watch 
 Newer Flava Flav clock 
 Be the first nigga cop that drop then pull straight up to the block (scrr scrr) 
 Got my mind right, now I run through the streets 
 I might take flight, don't care if it's he or she 
 I might make it, Mayweather, just like TMT, ya' digg? 
 And I got Deaf Greg with me 
 Got my mind right and go got it 
 Got my mind right and go got it 
 Got my mind right and go got it 
 Got my mind right and went got it 
 Got my mind right and went got it 
 Got my mind right, you ain't got it 
 Got my mind right, you ain't got it 
 Got my mind right, got it
