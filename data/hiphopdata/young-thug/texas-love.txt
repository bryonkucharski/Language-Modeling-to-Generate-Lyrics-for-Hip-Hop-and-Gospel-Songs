I got more hoes than Kanye West clothes 
 These bitches swallowin' and jumping like a fuckin' toad 
 Wanna kiss your body, it's a lot, but hey Ms. Jackson 
 Bae don't worry bout 'em I got 'em whoa 
 Fendi with Prada, need no stylists I dress clothes 
 Dressing in style and Pat Rileys 
 I'mma let you ride it while I bite it 
 Aye baby can we lay up, can we lay up 
 Black nigga at the court counter there with a mink coat on 
 Got a fat ass and some D cups on 
 Call her at Popeyes, we can link up later on 
 Nigga aired out the spot now we can't link later on 
 I just want to flirt with you, want to flirt with you ya 
 Took it straight from a boy 
 Now I don't know what to do with you ya 
 I don't care what y'all think nigga just do you aye 
 I was teachin' my dawg like I was Blues Clues aye 
 I just picked a 40 up on the back end 
 Got lil mama in the room running back in 
 I just popped a molly now I'm going back in 
 No features I don't do features 
 I don't like leeches and I done had enough of these leakers yeah 
 If Texas love was a drug (You'd belong to me) 
 If Texas love was a drug (You'd belong to me) 
 If Texas, Texas, Texas was a drug 
 If Texas, Texas, Texas was a drug, drug, drug, drug, drug 
 Drug, drug, drug 
 I gahdamn 
 Sell the fuck out 
 I mean I wouldn't be able to keep a pack 
 You know what I'm saying 
 How you digg that 
 You can take a ride through the lime light 
 I can take a ride through the wild life 
 I can kick game like the Pied Piper 
 YSL Denzel sniper 
 Hundred bands in the damn Bible 
 I got a hundred bodies and they all idols 
 I first heard that they all 'bout it 
 But these niggas ain't even fightas 
 And these niggas ain't even buyers 
 I heard they leasing everything they ridin' in 
 And all they kids passed out in the play pen 
 Made a million dollars I'm amazing 
 They was popping collars I was patient 
 That's a massive foul nigga flagrant 
 Got on hella chains like a slave bitch 
 And I'm at it never comtemplatin' 
 Nigga gripping tan up the damn street 
 R.I.P. to Bankroll Fresh street 
 Niggas ridin' tan up the S40 
 The Maserati like the Kash Doll 
 When the drought come bring them bands up 
 I'm in LA bring the plaid out 
 Put the monkey bitches lookin' sad out 
 Watch a rich nigga issue cash out 
 If Texas love was a drug (You'd belong to me) 
 If Texas love was a drug (You'd belong to me) 
 If Texas, Texas, Texas was a drug 
 If Texas, Texas, Texas was a drug, drug, drug, drug, drug 
 I said if Texas love was a drug 
 I would never give it up 
 I would do a hundred year 'bout it 
 Long as it get me right 
 Long as it get me round 
 I'mma burn the house down 
 If Texas was a drug 
 If Texas showed the love 
 I meant, they showed love so if Texas was a drug 
 I'd never never share 
 I want it all in my belly 
 I wan it all in my neck 
 I want it all in my hair 
 I want it all on my bae 
 I want it all in my spot 
 I want it all in the mansion 
 I want to fuck on your thot 
 Your baby momma at the spot 
 You was tripping 'cause I had your baby momma at the spot 
 She was with my hoe though nigga
