I got like 5 million and 12 hundred thousand hoes 
 They drippin' all over my motherfuckin' clothes 
 Let's go off the dome, I can't make it home 
 I fucked her, I boned her, she leave an aroma 
 They calling my phone up, my girl like "What's going on?" 
 She sucking, put me in a coma, I nut on that bitch on my sofa 
 What's brackin' 
 Dickie suit, chucks 
 Flag hanging to the right 
 Put that young bitch in a bucket 
 Kid Cudi, fuck her all day and all night 
 Ok, I'm in this bitch with lil Duke, Longway 
 You can be with me, you too, four way 
 Put that bitch off from my deuce, slow day 
 I'ma sell at least like 2 
 Thugga Thugga what it do 
 Riding in the fast lane, I'm eluding (Skrrr) 
 All these drugs that we abusing (drugs) 
 Addicting to winning, not losing 
 I'm in the kitchen just cooking (cook it up) 
 Middle finger to a bookin' (fuck em) 
 Fuck running off, fuck nigga I took it 
 Diamond so wet, I might need to douche it 
 Diamonds they shower, they shower me 
 Yes that lil nigga I got with me 
 When it's war my niggas count on me 
 Beyoncé bitch I'm a bumble-B 
 This the B-hive, this my turf bitch, you can't sting on me 
 Jingle bells, baby you can ring on me 
 Let's go off the dome, I can't make it home 
 I fucked her, I boned her, she leave an aroma 
 They calling my phone up, my girl like "What's going on?" 
 She sucking, put me in a coma, I nut on that bitch on my sofa 
 What's brackin' 
 458 California 'Rari 
 I got that old money, call it Atari 
 Let's go off the dome, I trap by the Dome 
 Keep a couple grams in my fifth pocket 
 Keep a pocket rocket on me 
 Ain't no guessing if I'm gon' pop it 
 Got a lot of blood homies 
 And guess what it ain't no stopping 
 Hop in the car and I'm whiling, I'm styling 
 I hop out and cuss out my driver 
 Fuck nigga try me, no Eddie Bauer 
 I'ma pull up and make it rain, showers 
 I'ma lil kid when it come to that pussy 
 I hop up like the Icy Tower (hop up) 
 I would rather be a coyote than be a coward 
 I creep right up on them 
 Hit 'em with the AK, 7 in the morning (pew pew) 
 No Christmas Eve 
 Caught him by surprise, he was still yawning 
 I'm running the city 
 You riding in that loaner, I'm running with owners 
 I'm running with armor 
 I'm not even thinking I'm right off the dome 
 Let's go off the dome, I can't make it home 
 I fucked her, I boned her, she leave an aroma 
 They calling my phone up, my girl like "What's going on?" 
 She sucking, put me in a coma, I nut on that bitch on my sofa 
 What's brackin'
