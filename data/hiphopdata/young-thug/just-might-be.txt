 Ever gon see, yeah, I promise! 
 Aye man get your mutherfuckin hands away from my syrup man 
 Livin' life bro, I'm happy 
 Baby you know that I might be the realest lil nigga you ever gone see 
 Baby you know that I might be trillest lil nigga that you wanna be 
 Baby you know that I might be the richest lil nigga you ever could treat 
 And you know that I might just scoop that lil bitch up off of her feet 
 All of these niggas they know that they fallin' and everyone wanna be me 
 All of these bitches don't wanna be cheated on but all these bitches wan' cheat 
 All of these bitches wanna be the new wifey but all of these bitches be cheatin' 
 All of these rappers I swear they watering down and I'm the chlorine 
 Feed me, feed me 
 These pussy niggas tighter than a wedgie, weegee 
 I live life like a sniper, they can't see me, see me 
 Her heart like an old diaper, I can't leave it, leave it 
 I'm drinkin' on this motherfuckin' mud 
 Okay my fuckin' back pocket is fat like a butt 
 I swear I'mma blood, I can never be your 'cause 
 You can roger that like my motherfuckin' buzz (Losie!) 
 (Mumbling) 
 I'll bippoty-bop, then stick it and fade 
 I keep some coke and the rocks on me everyday 
 I got a bitch with a yacht missin' in the bay 
 Come here tempt me if you wan' go on a date 
 I'll make bail within' the first 48 
 I'll give her the stick 
 She gone get a clip, bigger than a porn star dick 
 And I need new casting, for a porn star clip 
 Baby you know that I might be the realest lil nigga you ever gone see 
 Baby you know that I might be trillest lil nigga that you wanna be 
 Baby you know that I might be the richest lil nigga you ever could treat 
 And you know that I might just scoop that lil bitch up off of her feet 
 All of these niggas they know that they fallin' and everyone wanna be me 
 All of these bitches don't wanna be cheated on but all these bitches wan' cheat 
 All of these bitches wanna be the new wifey but all of these bitches be cheatin' 
 All of these rappers I swear they watering down and I'm the chlorine 
 That's called breathin', that's how you let that bitch breathe fool 
 Okay you know all my diamonds got no flaws 
 Momma move to 85 north, not 85 south 
 I think these hoes piranhas, excluding my baby momma 
 I take care my daddy momma by pullin' up with them bundles 
 If I ain't treat you good little baby just know it's karma 
 You did my nigga wrong, I know it, it was last summer 
 Lyin' to me, tellin' me I'm the bomb like Osama 
 I wish I could spend 50 bands on tour for grandmama 
 I'll crack that nigga head with a bottle 
 I could never call, not a fed, not a cop 
 Niggas sit on the bench and I said do y'all 
 YSL scream "fuck the rest" 'cause we got right now 
 Niggas asked me "Am I sure?", and the Bentley said "Yeah" 
 That little bitch ask for a purse and you know I said "Yeah" 
 She gone act just like a clerk when them feds in there 
 She might act like she know Bird when them players in there 
 Baby you know that I might be the realest lil nigga you ever gone see 
 Baby you know that I might be trillest lil nigga that you wanna be 
 Baby you know that I might be the richest lil nigga you ever could treat 
 And you know that I might just scoop that lil bitch up off of her feet 
 All of these niggas they know that they fallin' and everyone wanna be me 
 All of these bitches don't wanna be cheated on but all these bitches wan' cheat 
 All of these bitches wanna be the new wifey but all of these bitches be cheatin' 
 All of these rappers I swear they watering down and I'm the chlorine
