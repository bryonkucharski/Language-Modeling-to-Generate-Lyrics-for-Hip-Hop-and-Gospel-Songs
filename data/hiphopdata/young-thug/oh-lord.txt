Oh lord, oh lord 
 Oh lord, oh lord 
 Oh lord, oh lord 
 Oh lord 
 Oh lord, oh lord 
 Oh lord, oh lord 
 Oh lord, lord, lord 
 Oh lord, lord, lord 
 Oh, find me, oh lord 
 They need to free me, aye 
 Oh my, oh lord 
 Like I just seen a whole key 
 Diamonds work magic like a genie 
 Expensive, my fabric, don't need it 
 Your bitch, she got a butt-head, Beavis 
 You know I'm kickin' shit like Feely 
 I really want your cat, no kitty 
 If I ain't talkin' to you, no speakin' 
 You know a nigga Slime like the deacon 
 So, I'm only fucking you for the weekend 
 She said she need a hundred just to begin 
 Shawty wet, but she ain't a sea fish 
 Niggas stand in line for the pretest 
 Oh lord, oh lord 
 Oh lord, oh lord 
 Oh lord, oh lord 
 Oh lord 
 Oh lord, oh lord 
 Oh lord, oh lord 
 Oh lord, lord, lord 
 Oh lord, lord, lord 
 Make your girl gimme that turtle neck 
 Stomach flat like "where that girdle at?" 
 100K can't fit where your purses at 
 Hundred bill come through the mail like where them purses at? 
 Hundred bitches boolin' on the dock 
 I done spend two hundred on the clock 
 Don't think I'm a jay when I wear rocks 
 Minks on the floor, I ain't need no socks 
 They wanna take it there 
 They wanna what? 
 What they want? 
 They wanna take it there 
 Come on, come on already 
 Oh lord, oh lord 
 Oh lord, oh lord 
 Oh lord, oh lord 
 Oh lord 
 Oh lord, oh lord 
 Oh lord, oh lord 
 Oh lord, lord, lord 
 Oh lord, lord, lord
