These nigga's knock off diamonds are shining 
 But they ain't blinding 
 No pizza bitch I got banks in my pockets 
 Where's the ladder I'm climbing 
 She gon pop, lock it and drop it 
 I ain't talking wrist but she watching 
 Me right now, hundred bands stuffed in my jeans right now 
 YSL, there's no "I" in "team" right now, no way 
 Beating the block till the sun come up 
 I'm rocking gold like Rols-R-Us 
 I talk more shit than Damien does 
 I put the steel up in stain lil 'cause 
 I, I, I, I be that Young Thugger Thug 
 Throwing these bitches straight off of the boat 
 We don't save them 
 Hey, a wise man told me nothin' 
 He said them snitches they get stitches 
 I just spent a Bentley on my kidneys 
 Saying I gave my bro the address to road to riches 
 I, I might just take care of bae 
 Yeah, I might just make karat my ladies 
 On my worse day she a 9 like Brady 
 But I traded in the Keisha or Kaycee's 
 Yeah, she love me, she love me, love me for that 
 Yeah, she love me, she love me, love me for that 
 Yeah, she love it, I'm honest she loving that 
 Yeah, my love is so big she can't lose that 
 Thugger 
 Ay, yeah, yeah 
 Sing to her, yeah 
 That's how you do it nigga 
 That's how you motherfucking do it nigga 
 Peep this, ay 
 L-O-V-E, I say lil mama down to ride and die for me 
 Okay, you green no seaweed 
 Psych, I want you to hurry get into me 
 I drop like ten thousands ones on her lil buns 
 I told her come on home hun 
 You can have my son 
 We eat ching chong, diamonds they go boing 
 Hop inside that pussy like a trampoline, boing boing 
 Hey wait 
 Grab that lil ass by the way 
 Beep beep beep like a bus on that ass, so big 
 I swear to god I'mma fuck her now her body getting big 
 I swear to god I'mma do everything that I ain't did 
 Plus brodie said that bitch pussy bright pink as a pig 
 I, I might just take care of bae 
 Yeah, I might just make karat my ladies 
 On my worse day she a 9 like Brady 
 But I traded in the Keisha or Kaycee's 
 Yeah, she love me, she love me, love me for that 
 Yeah, she love me, she love me, love me for that 
 Yeah, she love it, I'm honest she loving that 
 Yeah, my love is so big she can't lose that
