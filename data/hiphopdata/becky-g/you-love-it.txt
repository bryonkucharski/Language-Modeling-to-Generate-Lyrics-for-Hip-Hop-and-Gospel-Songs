I just, I just, I just wanna load this on a pod 
 Call up my homegirls and put it up in the car 
 Ride through the city and run through the lights 
 It's gonna be our theme song for trouble tonight 
 See a cutie pull up right next to me, next to me 
 Gave him the digits, he can't stop texting me, texting me 
 We just riding, we rolling, you know how we cruise 
 And when this come on, yeah, you know how we do (Let's go) 
 You wanna hear something to make you wild and crazy 
 Beat the block up like Turner (Beat it) 
 Every time you chilling and you with your homies 
 You need a little something for the turn up (We need it) 
 You should turn this up on your radio and play it in the club 
 Keep it on replay, show me some love 
 Over and over again, make it your song 
 Party to this one until the morn 
 'Cause I know, I know, I know, I know you love it 
 (You love, you love) 
 I know, I know, I know, I know you love it 
 (You love, you love) 
 I know, I know, I know, I know you love it 
 (You love, you love) 
 So turn it up and baby keep it bumpin' (just keep it bumpin') 
 So turn it up to the max 
 The louder it gets the more I wanna shake my ass 
 This beat hit so hard I swear that it hurt 
 This beat hit so hard it makes you wanna twerk 
 Fellas looking they keep jocking me 
 My body moving so they watching me 
 I'm gonna give you something you can look, look, look at 
 As soon as the doctor give me that boom boom boom pat 
 You wanna hear something to make you wild and crazy 
 Beat the block up like Turner (Beat it) 
 Every time you chilling and you with your homies 
 You need a little something for the turn up (We need it) 
 You should turn this up on your radio and play it in the club 
 Keep it on replay, show me some love 
 Over and over again, make it your song 
 Party to this one until the morn 
 'Cause I know, I know, I know, I know you love it 
 (You love, you love) 
 I know, I know, I know, I know you love it 
 (You love, you love) 
 I know, I know, I know, I know you love it 
 (You love, you love) 
 So turn it up and baby keep it bumpin' (just keep it bumpin') 
 Keep it bumpin', keep, keep it bumpin' 
 Keep it bumpin', keep, keep it bumpin' 
 Keep it bumpin', keep, keep it bumpin' 
 Keep it bumpin', keep, keep it bumpin' 
 Keep, keep, keep, keep 
 Turn it up, play it loud 
 And don't you stop, blow the speakers out 
 Ow, yeah 
 You should turn this up on your radio and play it in the club 
 Keep it on replay, show me some love 
 Over and over again, make it your song 
 Party to this one until the morn 
 'Cause I know, I know, I know, I know you love it 
 (You love, you love) 
 I know, I know, I know, I know you love it 
 (You love, you love) 
 I know, I know, I know, I know you love it 
 (You love, you love) 
 So turn it up and baby keep it bumpin' (just keep it bumpin')
