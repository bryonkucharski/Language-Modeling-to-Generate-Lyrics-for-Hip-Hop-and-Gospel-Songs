You're the one I wanna talk about, talk about 
 Had a few but you knock 'em out, knock 'em out 
 Might just let you meet my mama now, mama now 
 Might just let you lock it, lock it down 
 'Cause I've been loving how you are with me, are with me 
 Ain't no fussing, ain't no arguin', arguin' 
 Every plane needs a pilot, pilot 
 Tell me baby who you're flying with? 
 Like ooh ah, wanna, wanna be around you 
 Got me breaking, breaking all of my rules oh 
 It's all the little things that you do 
 That got me like ooh (ooh) 
 When I wake up 
 You're the first thing that comes to mind 
 Wanna see you like all the time 
 Yeah we be lovin' so hard 
 When I wake up 
 You're the first thing that comes to mind 
 Wanna see you like all the time 
 Yeah we be lovin' so hard 
 We be lovin' 
 We be lovin' so hard 
 We be lovin' 
 We be lovin' so hard 
 Ain't nobody love him like I love him 
 Ain't nobody steal him 
 Damn we be lovin' hard 
 We be lovin' 
 We be lovin' so hard 
 We be lovin' 
 We be lovin' so hard 
 I'm miss him when I'm holding him 
 Miss him when I'm kissing him 
 Damn we be lovin' hard 
 Tryna find, find the words to say, words to say 
 To describe what you mean to me, mean to me 
 Side by side like a yin and yang, yin and yang 
 Like the stair up to my little wing 
 And it'd be hard, it'd be hard at times, hard at times 
 But in the dark boy you are my light, are my light 
 The boom boom to my dynamite, dynamite 
 Baby you, you my ride or die 
 Like ooh ah, wanna, wanna be around you 
 Got me breaking, breaking all of my rules oh 
 It's all the little things that you do 
 That got me like ooh (ooh) 
 When I wake up 
 You're the first thing that comes to mind 
 Wanna see you like all the time 
 Yeah we be lovin' so hard 
 When I wake up 
 You're the first thing that comes to mind 
 Wanna see you like all the time 
 Yeah we be lovin' so hard 
 We be lovin' 
 We be lovin' so hard 
 We be lovin' 
 We be lovin' so hard 
 Ain't nobody love him like I love him 
 Ain't nobody steal him 
 Damn we be lovin' hard 
 We be lovin' 
 We be lovin' so hard 
 We be lovin' 
 We be lovin' so hard 
 I'm miss him when I'm holding him 
 Miss him when I'm kissing him 
 Damn we be lovin' hard 
 We be lovin' 
 We be lovin' so hard 
 We be lovin' 
 We be lovin' so hard 
 Ain't nobody love him like I love him 
 Ain't nobody steal him 
 Damn we be lovin' hard 
 We be lovin' 
 We be lovin' so hard 
 We be lovin' 
 We be lovin' so hard 
 I'm miss him when I'm holding him 
 Miss him when I'm kissing him 
 Damn we be lovin' hard
