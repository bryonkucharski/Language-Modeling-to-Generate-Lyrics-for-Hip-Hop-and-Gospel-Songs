The lights are shining like the sun out tonight 
 Just keep your body moving how I like 
 Oh, yeah the music feels like paradise 
 Can't get any better, no 
 I wanna stay right in this moment for life 
 Baby, treat me wrong, treat me right 
 Ay ay ay, aye 
 Just can't stop dancing 
 Ay ay ay, aye 
 Don't wanna chance it 
 So don't let go, let go of me 
 Don't let go, let go of me 
 Ay ay ay, aye 
 I just can't stop dancing 
 Again now 
 Spin around now 
 Down now, 
 To the floor now 
 Your mind is going places I can feel 
 That further let's me know this is real 
 And I won't stop you no I like it there 
 You can even go further, babe 
 'Cause nothing's forbidden 
 Don't be scared, no worries 
 Once I'm there, all is forgiven 
 So be prepared 
 To come and push up on my... 
 Ay ay ay, aye 
 Just can't stop dancing 
 Ay ay ay, aye 
 Don't wanna chance it 
 So don't let go, let go of me 
 Don't let go, let go of me 
 Ay ay ay, aye 
 I just can't stop dancing 
 Again now 
 Spin around now 
 Down now, 
 To the floor now 
 Believe it, I feel it 
 It's in the air 
 Although you can't see it you know it's there 
 My heart keeps on racing, in overdrive 
 Once the music hits my body I feel so alive 
 And it's alright 
 It's got me like... 
 Ay ay ay, aye 
 Just can't stop dancing 
 Ay ay ay, aye 
 Don't wanna chance it 
 So don't let go, let go of me 
 Don't let go, let go of me 
 Ay ay ay, aye 
 I just can't stop dancing 
 Ay ay ay, aye 
 Just can't stop dancing 
 Ay ay ay, aye 
 I Don't wanna chance it 
 So don't let go, let go of me 
 Don't let go, let go of me 
 Ay ay ay, aye 
 I just can't stop dancing
