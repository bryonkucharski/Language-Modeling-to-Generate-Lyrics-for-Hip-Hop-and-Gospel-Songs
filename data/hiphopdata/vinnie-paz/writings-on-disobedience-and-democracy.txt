"We have to stop thinking that we must have military solutions 
 To the problems we face in the world" 
 Yeah 
 "The solutions that we need are..." 
 Picking up where we left off 
 "...Dealing of sickness, disease, and hunger 
 Now that's fundamental 
 If you want to end terrorism, you have to stop being terrorists 
 Which is what war is" 
 They told you World War II was a people's war 
 Logic should have told them it was Imperialist war 
 18 million served in the armed forces 
 10 million more overseas - that's enormous 
 25 million workers paid for war bonds 
 All of the while people question why the war's on 
 There was an undercurrent of reluctance 
 There were under-publicized signs of resistance 
 Hitler's Germany was unspeakable evil 
 But let's discuss real quick what we did to people 
 We opposed the Haitian revolution 
 We turned Guam, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii into institutions 
 Pretended to help Cuba win freedom from Spain 
 This country's built on the blood of other people's pain 
 Blacks is looking at anti-Semitism in Germany 
 And saw the situation here was mirroring it perfectly 
 We appeased Hitler all throughout the '30s 
 Only years later we pretended we was worried 
 Roosevelt was hesitant to be gritty 
 And caused a resolution to be buried in committee 
 The main interest was never to stop fascism 
 But advancing Imperialist interests of that prism 
 Roosevelt ain't care about oppression of the Jews 
 The power was the priority, I'm telling you the truth 
 Hitler not the reason that we entered the land 
 Roosevelt was mad that we got hit by Japan 
 Historians will tell you he provoked that shit 
 He told lies in attempts to sugar coat that shit 
 In '45 troops were jammed onto the Queen Mary 
 The blacks were stowed down in the depths of the same ferry 
 See there's a parallel you have to understand 
 That they wanted them to fight but wouldn't treat them like a man 
 Industrial mobilization had a few divided 
 The economic royalists denounced and derided 
 The irony of victory was heavily a price 
 The war ended, 3 million men was in strike 
 There's no peace in a world of capitalism 
 Nazi eugenics economic rationalism 
 The lesson was that war solved problems of control 
 Regardless if it causes any problems for the soul 
 The black revolt in the '50s came as a surprise 
 It shouldn't have after we took so many of their lives 
 You can't erase the memory of an oppressed people 
 Reparation doesn't make it any less evil 
 Some black folks joined the Communist party 
 Richard Wright spoke of disillusionment with the body 
 The party was accused of exploiting black people 
 Angelo Herndon felt everything was equal 
 He was arrested they convicted for insurrection 
 How the fuck it's insurrection I call it dissension 
 Gave him 5 years when all he wanted was protection 
 There was other black men that made the same connection 
 Benjamin Davis defended Herndon as a savior 
 Then Paul Robeson; he only magnified the danger 
 Harry Truman had to deal with the militant mood 
 But how the fuck that gonna work when he a racist too? 
 In '54 they said they ended segregation 
 10 years later no changes 
 Revolt was always minutes away about to bust 
 Rosa Parks refused the black section of the bus 
 The freedom riders were spreading across the nation 
 They went to jail for marching and fighting discrimination 
 FBI stood by, Justice Department stood by 
 While civil rights workers were beaten, they just stood by 
 3 civil rights workers, 2 black and 1 white 
 Arrested in Philadelphia, Mississippi one night 
 They were released, beaten with chains and shot to death 
 There were arrests made but it was not confessed 
 The national government remained silent 
 The president wouldn't defend blacks against violence 
 Civil rights laws were passed but they were fraud 
 Equality was enforced poorly or was ignored 
 Martin Luther King's speech floored whoever heard it 
 5 years later he was targeted and murdered 
 In '65 the Watts Riots burned into the streets 
 The black man would no longer turn the other cheek 
 The Black Panther Party scared Nixon 
 But that did nothing to change his position 
 A new black consciousness was born and still alive 
 And that came from the will to survive 
 This is the part where I would talk about Vietnam 
 But me and Rugged Man we already made a song 
 By the '70s distrust had spread across the nation 
 Basic discontent political alienation 
 55,000 died in the war of moral shame 
 And then Watergate was added to the hall of pain 
 The Watergate burglaries was rather complicated 
 But in the end mostly all of them exonerated 
 Nixon had CIA a G. Gordon Liddy 
 Lie about the Democratic National Committee 
 But eventually they all flipped on him 
 And told the Senate that they had a lot of shit on him 
 After that it was a swift and a sudden fall 
 Nixon resigned before they could impeach the ball 
 They got rid of Nixon but they kept the system 
 His foreign policy still remains in position 
 Corporate interests still remained in position 
 His closest advisors remain in position 
 Vietnam recession and unrest 
 All adds up to a motherfucking mess 
 After Watergate and Vietnam 
 There was a deep economic insecurity in this world of ours 
 Environmental deterioration took its toll 
 A cultural violence upon the families took its toll 
 Problems couldn't be solved without bold changes 
 But no major party candidates proposed changes 
 American political tradition held fast 
 Urban communities turning into hell fast 
 Black folks are bitterly disappointed with Carter 
 Opposed federal aid the poor people didn't bother 
 Reagan got elected and he built a military up 
 A trillion dollars later 
 And this motherfucker dummy up 
 He cut benefits for the poor to get the money up 
 Social security, disability went belly up 
 Unemployment grew in the Reagan years 
 30 million people unemployed in the Reagan years 
 Welfare became an object of attack 
 Especially if you was Latino or you was black 
 I'm just scratching the surface of what was wrong 
 We'll pick the conversation up in the next song 
 To be continued... 
 You can't be neutral on a moving train 
 I told y'all before 
 You can't believe everything that your teacher tell you 
 Who is your teacher? 
 Your teacher just learned what they was taught 
 How do you know what they was taught was correct? 
 Y'kna mean? 
 Dig into the real history of this country 
 And the fact that it was built on blood 
 We gonna go around for a third time 
 But for now I'm just blessing y'all with this one 
 A continuation of the first 
 You can't be neutral on a moving train 
 Pazienza 
 Howard Zinn thank you for teaching the people 
 Rest in Peace 
 It's Pazienza baby
