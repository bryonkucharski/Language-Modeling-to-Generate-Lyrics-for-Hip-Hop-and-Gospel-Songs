"And we fight for you know we are right. We must strike at the lies that'll spread like disease to our minds." 
 It's mind control, they stolen my mind 
 Verse 1 - Slaine: 
 I used to have the mind of a revolutionary now it's dead 
 Cause the Devil got these images that's dancing in my head 
 If I don't take these pills then I can't get out of bed 
 And I gotta pay the bills so I gotta take my meds 
 That's what the voice says, it was never there before 
 It was another voice that's telling me you're a father, you're a husband 
 The argument is hard to win, it leads to more discussion 
 Every other thought is rushing like it's fucking water busting 
 I've been sleeping with the TV 'cause I left it on 
 Pass out from the Xani bars licking chicken szechuan 
 Broken fingers figure shit I think it must've kept 'em gone 
 Otherwise I'm like a ticking effin bomb weapon drawn 
 Pace around the floor freaking every creak I'm stepping on 
 Thought I heard the cops coming no I must've guessed it wrong 
 Flip the stations all around, nothing but deception on 
 I don't know what's real or not, hear I'm planning methadone 
 (Verse 2: Trademarc) 
 Look I've never been mistaken for the social type 
 Overnight mix and match meds and get the potion right 
 Name it I take it I took it I baked it cooked it and ate it 
 Like God made it till I'm crooked 
 Psycho pharmaceuticals rebooted my brain 
 My death is stained by whatever's fun, the proof in my veins 
 So when I took it I stare at my reflection like it's throwing threats in my direction 
 Now I look at life and cope like any addict 
 Might be an addict by candlelight 
 Every shade drawn, every day's dawn good and gone as I write 
 You can bet it's like street corner hustling 
 FDA muscle in funnelling cash into new epidemics 
 They usher in mass produced pain 
 Paranoia that they mask with their lawyers and brass 
 Next stop poisonous gas, chill the citizen's strain 
 Chain smoke stacks burn us to ash 
 [Chorus / samples: We living in them days of the manmade ways 
 They brainwashing us, it's America's plan 
 I'm about to rebel, we all slaves in the system 
 We're dying over money and relying on religion] - 2X 
 Verse 3 - Vinnie Paz: 
 Yeah, I used to have the mind of a revolutionary but it's gone 
 I'm dishevelled, I'm a rebel, I'm a devil with a bomb 
 As I settle every motherfucking ghetto has a song 
 Put the metal to my temple when I wrestle with Saddam 
 Yeah you see the mind control divide your soul 
 I rhymed it though in '94 but no 
 Y'all ain't listened to anything I was telling y'all 
 About the biochip inside you and impending war 
 I run over you fucking devils like I'm Mendenhall 
 Overseas they dying young, they sending y'all 
 The cash system is dead, y'all just pretend to ball 
 Glocks and clips, apocalypse repent or fall 
 Do y'all believe in the birth of a nation? 
 I call it control, they call it coercive persuasion 
 Yeah all of them serpents of Satan 
 I'mma build a bomb shelter, only let the persons of faith in
