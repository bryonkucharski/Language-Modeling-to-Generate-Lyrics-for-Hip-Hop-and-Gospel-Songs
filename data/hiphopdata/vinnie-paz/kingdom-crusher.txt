 You can sense it in the air, man, you better beware, because 
 Something wicked this way comes 
 We run through your district, our guns are sadistic 
 Something wicked this way comes 
 When the hairs on the back of your neck stand erect, you know 
 Something wicked this way comes 
 If we display guns, all the bitches, they run, they know 
 Something wicked this way comes

 My level of rhyme is just another level of shine 
 My level divine, anyone on the level is dyin' 
 A rebel refined, telling you that the reverend lyin' 
 Malevolent mind, dump the fuckin' lead in your spine 
 Dead on the dime, leave his body redder than wine 
 It's lead in my palm, Vinnie the fuckin' deadliest Don 
 I'm raw and I'm delirious like Ed in his prime 
 I'm '99, Jedi Mind, baby, steadily shine 
 My pettiest fine, I would never regret or rewind 
 I would never separate the fuckin' bread and the wine 
 I would never fuckin' dedicate the dead to Haran 
 I would never fuckin' educate the heads to Haraam 
 The rebel of crime, that was like an echo in time 
 It's still me, I'm just better, I'm a better design 
 I'm better with time, you ain't a competitor, slime 
 I'm Romero when he made The Living Dead in his prime, yeah

 The method of raw is just another level of war 
 You're a pussy claat rapper, duke, I said it before 
 I should body you for leaving all that red on the floor 
 Hell is heaven, but you still believe that heaven is pure 
 Weapons on drawers, Vinnie only read the Koran 
 And if rhyming is religion, Vinnie P the imam 
 Peaceful Islam, Vinnie on his deen and he calm 
 That's the only reason I could ever see through the storm, yeah 
 Baggy jeans, Air Max and a four-fifth 
 Faggot rappers in the closet like old kicks 
 I got my own label now, I am so rich 
 And got more men that's down for me than Joe Smith 
 I'm addicted to vodka bottles and low shit 
 I'm addicted to topless models that nose sniff 
 Y'all ain't never have me open like an old gift 
 Who is y'all? I've been too busy to notice
