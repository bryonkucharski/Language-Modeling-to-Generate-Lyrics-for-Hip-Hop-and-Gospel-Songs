I'm not Jesus Christ or Mohammed but I can read and write 
 Between the lines I see a message, is it wrong or right? 
 I fight to keep my faith alive in the dark of the night 
 I use my mic to inspire, I hope you see the light 
 I'm not the prophet Abraham or Mahatma Gandhi 
 I'm just a man with many questions, sometimes they haunt me 
 I fight to keep my faith alive in the dark of the night 
 I use my mic to influence, I hope you see the light 
 In the dark of the night 
 Verse 1 - Freddy Madball: 
 In the name of the Father and Son, the Holy Spirit and this gun 
 That I protect my fam with in case my prayers don't protect us son 
 Is there a chosen one? Chosen few? Maybe none 
 Maybe when you're dead it's done 
 No sun, no moon, no light, no outcome 
 I love the thought of being reunited with my fam 
 Sounds like a scam sometimes though so here I stand 
 Crossing hands, a man trying to understand 
 Whose book of plans should I follow if they're written by hands 
 Just like my own, human to the bone 
 We are all flawed and scarred, nobody wants to die alone 
 I sit upon a throne, fearless in my home 
 My hood, the city and world that I roam, what about the unknown? 
 I'm not a clone to follow a nicely written poem 
 Scriptures structured to make you comb through your thoughts, your dome 
 I can't lead you home but I will ask the questions 
 I'm not an atheist, this is just a true confession 
 Verse 2 - Vinnie Paz: 
 In the dark of the night I wonder why I was placed here 
 My family told me put my faith in God and face fear 
 For some reason I ain't wanna put my faith there 
 And going to church I saw nothing but hate there 
 I ain't understand how everyone else could be wrong 
 And I ain't wanna be like everyone else and conform 
 Yeah so I had a discussion with moms 
 And that's around the same time I discovered Islam 
 The first time that I had peace in my life 
 The first time I had a reason and a beacon of light 
 And if another human being think that Jesus the light 
 I don't argue, I just hope that they have peace in their life 
 There's a war going on outside no man is safe from 
 Every religion have a god but it's the same one 
 Religion's just a tool to divide us and they won 
 I feel that God been standing beside me since day one 
 Verse 3 - Freddy Madball: 
 Am I faithful at heart and smart enough to find the right path? 
 Endure the wrath of a stormy past or will I be cast? 
 To a hell that no one can foretell if it exists 
 Or do we dwell in the midst of, if so I like Hell 
 I like Heaven too, it makes me feel so vital 
 The thought of living in peace and love, something so primal 
 Forget the titles, everyone has their rivals 
 But I think that it's bigger than all of us like this recital 
 Spiritually agnostic, curious and caustic 
 My thoughts sick regardless of what we think, have I lost it? 
 No I tossed it to the side, the simpleminded lies 
 Saint Mary mother of God, I still look in your eyes 
 Despite all I despised I realised that 
 I must take what I've learned and make it all mine 
 Until I die or fly with the other souls 
 Foolish pride won't stop me from asking why 
 Show me a sign
