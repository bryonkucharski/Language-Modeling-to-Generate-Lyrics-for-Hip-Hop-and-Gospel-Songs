Yeah, Pazienza baby. Billions what up cuzzo? Yeah cuzzo. 
 DJ Tricka??. Philly in the building out here. We mobbing on you mothafuckas. 
 Kna mean? Official Pistol Gang and all that. It's how we get down out here. 
 Verse 1 - Vinnie Paz: 
 I don't mean to brag but the knife work nice 
 And the rhyme's so evil that it might hurt Christ, yeah 
 Don't fuck around if you like your life 
 And the pistol always on me like it's white on rice 
 Once I hit the block cousin, it's all red 
 Spray them with the four-five glock and they all dead 
 Devil tried sleepin' in God bed 
 Hammer write 666 on the forehead 
 I make dough, but I don't fuck with the books 
 As a young boy maybe I would fuck with the chooks 
 That's how it had to be fuckin' with crooks 
 I'm a king in a castle so you fuckin' with rooks 
 Anyone want beef just ask for it 
 He can catch a universal and get trashed for it 
 I keep a couple ratchets in the jazzport 
 And they will put your fuckin' brains on the dashboard
