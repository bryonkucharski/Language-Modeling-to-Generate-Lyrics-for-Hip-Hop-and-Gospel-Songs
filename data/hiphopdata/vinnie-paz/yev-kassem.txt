You just started rapping, muhfucker, Vinnie P a vet 
 Don't believe me yet or this motherfucker will squeeze a TEC 
 How does a single one of y'all that don't believe in sense 
 Twenty-five years of people saying that he a threat 
 I stayed away a while, I ain't thought you need it yet 
 Big guns come with principles, some like he in debt 
 The only time you mention my name, to say that he the best 
 This blood clot weed's got seeds like a Chia Pet 
 And y'all don't want to be inside the precinct 
 Dirt-bag bunkie gon' be telling you what he think 
 Had to reevaluate a little bit and rethink 
 If I ain't trim the fat from the beef, money, we sink 
 So duck when 'em hollow tips rip through the air 
 A fully loaded magazine, the only shit that I share 
 And the boat tail hollow going to rip through your gear 
 Every hour, every second, every minute, I swear 
 Yeah, my first record told you I was the assassin now 
 So many that's rapping now, I need to cock it back and blaoh 
 You the reason being whack and frail coming back in style 
 Cause one drop of my blood is dirtier than Pacquiao 
 Y'all don't want to push me 
 Y'all a bunch of pussies 
 One shot'll sit 'em down 
 Y'all a bunch of pussies 
 Y'all don't want to push me 
 Blood clot and spin around 
 This is real life, money, this is not a fad 
 Got some young boys that buck for me like a dollar cab 
 Drone strike all you muhfuckers like Obama mad 
 You 'bout to take this life, end in Hell like Apollo had 
 Load the fucking hollow mag, hit in his attic 
 And my body only draped in magnificent fabric 
 Your bitch is a rabbit, the type to suck dick for the carats 
 What's your life like? How you like living embarrassed 
 My pistol is lavish, it's like we've got a difficult marriage 
 'Cause she don't like the way I use her when I spit at you savage 
 This bitch is just magic, dumb-dumb probably shook 
 Vinnie fat, but he fast if it's time to be book 
 I'm reminding you rook, Boxcutter talk with his hands 
 And if you like life, you gon' have to talk to your man's 
 You Padishah Emperor Shaddam, lost to the sand 
 This shit is simple, fam, shit is gone according to plan 
 Blam 
 ((x2)) 
 Y'all don't want to push me 
 Y'all a bunch of pussies 
 One shot'll sit 'em down 
 Y'all a bunch of pussies 
 Y'all don't want to push me 
 Blood clot and spin around
