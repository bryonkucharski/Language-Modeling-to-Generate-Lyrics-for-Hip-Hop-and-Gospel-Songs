Move back, we attack. Get down, lay down. 
 Verse 1 - Jus Allah: 
 We come guns blazing like the young sons of Satan 
 Some occasions gun play comes into the equations 
 Gotta keep the chrome for home invasions and break-ins 
 Go to your location with no notification 
 Quick to pick up the Glocks, fill the clip to the top 
 Kill the kids too little too big to adopt 
 Got a whole lot of lost souls, pick of the crop 
 Tape playing the oldies when you hear the click and the pop 
 It's nothing but ice in my veins, the devil has a mic in my brain 
 Has a lot of good advice to retain 
 What's not to like about the guy who had Christ slain? 
 I don't have the right to gripe and complain 
 I have to hide the remains, I have to get Tide for the stains 
 I have to find time that can bind and restrain 
 I have to find lives to attain 
 I'm looking for a homicide, offering a ride from the rain 
 Verse 2 - Vinnie Paz: 
 All you motherfuckers days is numbered 
 Attack the winter and I slay the summer 
 Pressure bust pipes god, I don't pay the plumber 
 Y'all don't put me to sleep, it's more of a state of slumber 
 Pimp shit, smash skins like your favorite drummer 
 I'm a shooter and a shooter do what a shooter please 
 A history of the broken land of the Sudanese 
 I spit a verse and a motherfucking computer freeze 
 The right hand is a bomb, it'll cost you two MCs 
 It's suicide rapper you can hang from Judas trees 
 We destroy and rebuild while y'all just shoot the breeze 
 Me and Buddha are separated by two degrees 
 The army gear is military and the boots are trees 
 The kevlar isn't a problem, I'll just shoot his knees 
 I rock a Panerai watch, y'all are boosting tees 
 Dirty money on the block, I recoup with ease 
 Y'all can't afford a sixteen, I'm charging stupid fees
