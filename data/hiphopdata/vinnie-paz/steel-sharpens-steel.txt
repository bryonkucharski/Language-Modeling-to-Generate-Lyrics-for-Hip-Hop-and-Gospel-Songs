 Fuck you talking 'bout? 
 Is you high cause you done lost a nigga? 
 I got bitches that'll turn you on just to off a nigga 
 Now fuck a whip, whip, fuck a Nae Nae, Nae Nae 
 I keep an AK, trying to fuck a Kardashian just like a Ray J 
 Damn, with Taylor Swift recording me in my new play date 
 Who's that? That's Kanye West in my basement 
 Now let me ask you something, why you mad at boy? 
 Man, I ain't mad at all, matter fact 
 I wrote this shit, focusing on the Adderall 
 Every time I'm with your girl, she treat me like a superstar 
 She be sucking harder than the bitches in the hookah bars 
 Okay, I clap chrome, hit him in his back bone 
 I'm that thrown, any given holiday 
 Halloween, mask on, get dragged on 
 The gas station pump section, match on 
 This gon' be a rough ride, very far from Drag-On 
 You ain't never earned respect, nigga, yous a nervous wreck 
 Choke you like a turtle neck, then pop you like a Percocet 
 You could never hurdle death, you guaranteed to die, nigga 
 Don't get out of line, nigga, this ain't just a rhyme, nigga

 Fifty-percent of these motherfuckers ain't fucking with me 
 (They ain't fucking with me) 
 The other fifty-percent of these motherfuckers, put 'em under for free 
 (Put 'em under for free) 
 Money, I ain't playing, I'm just saying 
 I lay your pussy out, put 'em under the pavement 
 I ain't playing, what the fuck is you saying? 
 Official Pistol Gang, we ain't nothing to play with

 My whole team a bunch of muhfucking apes 
 Gorilla put the lama to your muhfucking face 
 But I ain't tryna catch another muhfucking case 
 If you wanna make wine, you gotta crush a couple grapes 
 I know a couple Avalon, know a couple Piru 
 Got a couple shooters that's ensuring my survival 
 Y'all are writing novels, I'mma write a bible 
 Vinnie selling gas and it coming out the nozzle 
 And I don't want trouble, I'm just trying to hit a lick 
 And if it's really drama, money, hit me on the hip 
 They trying to give him twenty, 'cause they hit him with a brick 
 He stupid and he know it, so he getting what he get 
 I got 'em ducking bullets like he leaning off a Perc' 
 If you ain't getting fetty, what's the meaning of the work? 
 If it ain't the fifteenth, he fiending for the first 
 I hope you'll understand it ain't no grieving in the dirt 
 He merked
