Verse 1 - Ill Bill: 
 My discipline go beyond the way the army train people, calmly spray people 
 Devil's horns up like Ronnie James Dio or Tony Iommi, cut your fucking arms off 
 Stole me a roadie, I'm mob deep like Tony Lionni 
 Cross between the Egyptian god of fire ? ride ten times higher 
 Than a soprano in god's choir 
 A Heavy Metal King like ? crack on gun metal ring 
 Settle things like God's prayer and the Devil's wings 
 We feast at the Last Supper, you hear the last laugh from us 
 Scrape cash abundant, you hear the gats blast from us 
 Roll with ? conquer continents like Genghis Khan 
 My life is like a Misfits song or like Cypress Hill, hits from the bong 
 I'm like Ice T six in the morn, police at my door 
 Shoot the beast in the ? squeezing the four, creep in the six 
 Then breeze to L'amour, the Lords of War for four seasons or more 
 Listen 
 Verse 2 - Vinnie Paz: 
 This is goon music, something for Vinnie gun to clap 
 Y'all ain't making no progress, y'all still are running laps 
 I think of y'all like Christ, y'all never coming back 
 Chainsaws and husky bears without the lumberjacks 
 Come on pana, Vinnie got a clip full 
 I'mma let this four-fifth bark like it's a pitbull 
 Money I got a fistful and I got an razor and it cut like if you skip school 
 I can be on that fight the power, ? shit 
 I can be on that Gucci and on that Prada shit 
 I can be on that questioning if a god exists 
 I can be on that punch in your face and rob you shit 
 That's when motherfuckers starving and such 
 Dry snitching, all y'all motherfuckers crying too much 
 Give me a jar and the dutch 
 I just caught a body and I'm proud of all this rhyming and such, yeah
