(Verse 1: Slaine) 
 From Roslindaley to Philly to anywhere on the map really 
 I been spitting real raps like a bastard 
 Clapping with the Mac milli 
 What's happening is I'm actually stacking 
 Strictly re-enacting life graphically 
 I've been challenging these cats to come and ask with me 
 If they can but they can't 'cause I'm that shifty 
 My army is too large, my conscience been drowning 
 I dumped his ass in the fucking lake, he never been found 
 And I've been down and out, rose out of my own ashes 
 The rest of you's is stupid as dogs sniffing your own asses 
 When I was grown I seen holmes making his own acid 
 Sniffing coke with his folks then coming home plastered 
 I seen suicides, overdoses, and chrome blasted 
 I war with people who wanted me in my own casket 
 I made it out alive in stereo to stare at you 
 The Dimock to seven-figures right here in America 
 *Scratching* 
 Ghetto landscapes, where a man is determined by how much a man make 
 (Verse 2: Reef The Lost Cauze) 
 Lost Cauze lyrical leviathon, literally leave your limbs 
 Littered laying in the lion's den 
 Lying men make we want to fire ten into their spine and limbs 
 Buy them a fucking heart, you got beef then don't deny it then 
 Fuck a fair one, air gun share some 
 The MAC make a fat nigga leap like Air Pun 
 God rest the dead but God bless your head (no homo) 
 And my dojo is calm, breath, and lead 
 I sit in a dank basement blowing bank statements 
 On a dank fragrance planning my next invasion 
 Like Slaine in The Town flick, quick as a hundred rounds spit 
 You fucking pussy cats, I'm a hundred pound pit 
 Astounding rocking a hoodie make of hound's skin 
 My balls, your broad loves her lips around them 
 A nigga say he fucking with me, he a clown then 
 You should kill yourself for even hanging around him 
 (Verse 3: Vinnie Paz) 
 I rose above everything they threw at the kid 
 Pops dead, no fucking bread, doing the bid 
 I had a choice, I could rhyme or put two in your wig 
 Cause an option for me was never pursuing a gig 
 Yeah I made demos, they spit in my face, begin again 
 I started having reservations like an Indian 
 I'm a man of God but I started to sin again 
 Cause motherfuckers was sleeping on me like Lithium 
 It's a lot of years later I'm still nice with the hands 
 I'm a dick to my people but I'm nice to the fans 
 Some other rappers talk shit but they rightfully stand 
 Dig in the same fucking place where they rightfully stand 
 Me and Slaine been around the fucking world together 
 Drinking bottles, sniffing something, fucking girls together 
 And the objective is to take over the world together 
 And the objective is to take over the world together
