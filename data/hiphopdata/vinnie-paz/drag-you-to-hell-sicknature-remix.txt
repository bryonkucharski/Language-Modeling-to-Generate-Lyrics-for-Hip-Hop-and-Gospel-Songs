Yeah, temperature's rise. It's getting hot. The Sicknature Remix. Wat Paz? Drag 'em to hell. 
 Verse 1 - Vinnie Paz: 
 See I always have respect 'cause I always talk facts 
 The .38 and the 50 caliber hot, black 
 I always left with nothing but I always brought back 
 I always been a hustler, I pollied go off that 
 Y'all don't wanna go to work with the boy 
 There's only two words that describe me: search and destroy 
 I don't think you wanna get murked by the boy 
 My shit is military, y'alls is like a nursery toy 
 It's hurting you boys 
 My team ain't even hungry, we famished 
 I murder everybody, fuck collateral damage 
 I'm animal savage with Hannibal's habits 
 I'll mangle your cabbage 
 I walked into the parish and I strangled the faggots 
 I hang with the baddest brothers, put their trust into Jesus 
 Run with brothers who's forty guzzlers, Islamic extremists 
 Ugly and ignorant is how they perceive us 
 I don't care, I'm trying to deal with my personal demons 
 It's happening, yes it's fucking happening 
 I'm grabbing y'all by the throat and draggin' y'all to hell 
 It's happening, yes it's fucking happening 
 I'm grabbing y'all by the throat and takin' y'all to hell 
 It's time to go to hell...
