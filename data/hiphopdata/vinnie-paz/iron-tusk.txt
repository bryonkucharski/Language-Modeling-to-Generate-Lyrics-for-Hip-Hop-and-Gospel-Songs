(Conway) 
 Yeah 
 How you want it when you want it nigga? 
 Y'kna mean? 
 (Conway) 
 Look, the bag buried in the yard by the pit bulls 
 Hollows in the HK, got a clip full 
 Niggas be thinking that my shit's good 
 They don't know I took ten losses last year, '96 Bulls 
 But I ain't tripping, 'cause my wrist good 
 Fuck these industry niggas, I'm '96 Suge 
 Hang you off the balcony for a brick 
 Trigger on the fifth get pulled 
 Who would've thought I'd be this good? 
 Told you I'm a different dude 
 I went from sleeping on a cot to hitting the lot to pick and choose 
 Stomp a nigga till he didn't move 
 There's blood on the bottom 
 Got my 750s looking like Christian Loos 
 Damn, these niggas is stressed looking deprived 
 I'll put you to sleep, you can rest good in the sky 
 I just go in the booth, I'm like Westbrook on the drive 
 I'm better than just good, the best nigga is I, motherfucker 
 (Vinnie Paz) 
 You better duck muhfucker when the fifth blow rounds 
 'Cause I'm here mean I'm here, pussy ten toes down 
 And I suggest you ain't around when this shit go down 
 And the Gucci on the crown is a retro brown 
 Listen par, everything you be saying is noise 
 I'm a man, you a pedophile playing with boys 
 I'm must be soften' up a little, 'cause I gave you a choice 
 I'mma have to ask God why he gave you a voice 
 Who these dumb muhfuckers that's believing it's geek 
 Because the numbers never lie, pussy read it and weep 
 But the Twitter figures telling me you eager to sleep 
 How you always in the crib and say you be in the street? 
 You's a batiman, B you need to get out the house more 
 This soft muhfucker need to button his blouse more 
 You eating? Money, why you always sleep on the couch for? 
 And I don't do battles, par, this is all out war 
 Yeah
