I don't know why y'all scared now, this ain't a new game* 
 Christians been raping children over in Ukraine 
 I don't indulge in small talk, it's only true pain 
 I don't divulge the plan ahk, I fuck with Hussein 
 Acid is falling from the sky, fuck a new reign 
 This is a flammable liquified gas butane 
 Muggs gave me audio heroin, hit the blue vein 
 I ain't even Vinnie no more, Evil my new name 
 I'm like Elijah Muhammad carrying thoughts afar 
 Laws of nature and mathematical charts of god 
 I'm taking everything letting you faggot authors starve 
 War criminals are becoming the arbiters of law 
 And y'all are fouler than swallowing pork 
 Real talk, free speech under foreign assault 
 And y'all are burying your head in the dirt 
 The heavy metal king hold big shit, hit your head with the lock 
 (Chorus: ~Sick Jacken~) 
 This shit is (raw), the Jedi Mind's (raw) 
 It's war with the metaphor and you ain't seen a storm before 
 You ain't Pac, get the fuck out of the underground floor 
 It's over, homie you ain't got no love anymore 
 Do it (raw), the Psychorealm's (raw) 
 This war's gonna end all, you ain't seen a storm before 
 I ain't taking this shit no more 
 We approach with a white skull when we assassinating y'all 
 I'm the father of anything that's been done before 
 I was sparring with you, I ain't even begun the war 
 I like darkness, I don't know what the sun is for 
 Y'all have small hammers, y'all must be the son of Thor 
 Don't need hands, telepathically the gun will draw 
 That's the reason that you motherfuckers is running for 
 I saw the angel Gabriel y'all who we coming for 
 Y'all lock your part the same hell when I confronted y'all 
 I can ascend without any physical death 
 I can repent without any physical breath 
 To me it's not a discussion it's invisible chess 
 And if the vodka not Russian then it ain't hitting the chest 
 I can talk about guns, drugs, deading your shit 
 I can talk about the Torah and dimensional shifts 
 The power of the almighty is what's sent through my lips 
 The power of the almighty when the sentinel spits 
 I'm the complete rapper, the seventh son of the beast master 
 My heart is bigger than anyone and it beats faster 
 I'm a fucking king getting better with each chapter 
 Kiss the fucking ring, you'd better agree bastard 
 A sucker MC like to think [? ] classic 
 I'm not a fucking star yet but the seed planted 
 Energy of god head, Vinnie P tantric 
 I'm capable of levitating and speak Sanskrit 
 Yeah, and that's all part of the perfect machine 
 Part of perfect precision, part of the perfect regime 
 Part of purpose and the part of the work on my Deen 
 Perform wudhu make salah now the surface is clean 
 Everything meticulous, Vinnie's work is pristine 
 Fuck with me you'll take a trip under earth with the queen 
 I give a fuck about a critic, I'm searching for cream 
 My shit is filled with hollow tips so it bursts in ya spleen
