My fist enters in your temple like an obelisk 
 It's blackness, darkness, abyss of joblessness 
 Everything you do is small, my shit is monstrous 
 I murder devils and any of their accomplices 
 My brain function on other levels of consciousness 
 My brain function on other levels of pompousness 
 You're listening to the bass and treble of godlessness 
 My thirty-eight will spit hate and level the populous 
 My esophogus breed the evil that just demolishes 
 Whether or not you're a believer in the Apocalypse 
 Y'all shit is sweeter than two faggots that's locking lips 
 It ain't a rapper competing with my obnoxiousness 
 It ain't nobody that's equal to my accomplishments 
 The Desert Eagle is legal and it astonishes 
 The AR15 diesel and blow your mom to bits 
 It's hard to catch me, I'm Thurman Munson and Carlton Fisk 
 Music is motivation for me to just go insane 
 Man I see it on paper, I know that I should be caged 
 And I'm trapped but I escaped it 
 By trapping in that trap for that paper 
 Music is motivation for me to just go insane 
 Man I see it on paper, I know that I should be caged 
 And I'm trapped but I escaped it 
 By trapping in that trap for that paper 
 Y'all know the flow is precise 
 You don't owe me your life 
 But that could change one roll of the dice 
 And then money try to go for his knife 
 I'mma levitate his body to the sky until he's homies with Christ 
 Don't even fuck around, son is a goon 
 Son is bipolar, alcoholic, son is consumed 
 I breathe life into the sun and the moon 
 I breathe life into the most barren bloodiest womb 
 Y'all don't know y'all getting stalked in the shower 
 Populism is rebellion over corporate power 
 Politics is just the talk of the hour 
 It's a matter of time before they hit another office or tower 
 I don't care, I put the gun to your ribs 
 And the Desert E big, it'll separate mothers from kids 
 I walked around from Philly slums to the bridge 
 Been around the world eighty times, nobody can fuck with the kid 
 Yeah
