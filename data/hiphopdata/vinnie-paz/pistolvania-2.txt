T is for terrible, H is for Hell 
 U is for ugly, and G is for jail 
 'Cause a thug can't spell 
 T is for terrible, H is for Hell 
 U is for ugly, and G is for jail 
 T is for terrible, H is for Hell 
 U is for ugly, and G is for jail 
 (Jakk Frost) 
 I done seen this gun-play change men 
 Shootouts turn gangstas into strange men 
 The AK drum rearrange men 
 Kurt Russell with a bounty, I'm the Hang Man 
 I hang men from west Philly to west Baltimore 
 To west coast, to west Africa 
 It's an A.O.T.P. BGC massacre 
 They call me The Flash 'cause I throw this hot shit so fast at ya 
 Red beams and dead dreams is all we know here 
 Fifty shot clips and weed is all we grow here 
 I'm from Philly dawg, you don't want to go there 
 Even the cops get hit with the .44 here 
 Really dawg, it's Pistolvania part two 
 My gun'll do surgery on your brain and your heart too 
 Plenty casualties when my crew blast niggas 
 A Darth Vader with a beard to you Luke ass niggas 
 (Jakk Frost) 
 Everybody got a gun, everybody want to ride 
 When it's all said and done, don't nobody want to die 
 Talking tough in the streets, everybody wonder why 
 At the funeral, everybody want to cry 
 Cry motherfucker, cry motherfucker, cry 
 Die motherfucker, die motherfucker, die 
 It's Pistolvania part two 
 It's Pistolvania part two 
 (Malik B) 
 Check me out 
 Yeah, homicide rate, nigga, I survive fate 
 I'm in live shape, pussy, you provide hate 
 You wearing a wire taped, my cap likes to jivate 
 They find the niggas all thrown through the fire escape 
 When I walk up, bodies all chalked up 
 On the asphalt in the dark when I spark up 
 I got a chemical remedy full of energy 
 Head shots mentally, show 'em my whole identity 
 A militant, my home is Pistolvania 
 Niggas act demonic, my brain is full of mania 
 I got arrangements to put you on the pavement 
 Check your brain waves and cause mental enslavement 
 You're not ready, I pop heavy, my shot steady 
 You want to talk about gas? Nigga, I got Getty 
 You're not ready to get close to an overdose 
 A militant coming through with Jehovah clothes 
 (Jakk Frost) 
 Everybody got a gun, everybody want to ride 
 When it's all said and done, don't nobody want to die 
 Talking tough in the streets, everybody wonder why 
 At the funeral, everybody want to cry 
 Cry motherfucker, cry motherfucker, cry 
 Die motherfucker, die motherfucker, die 
 It's Pistolvania part two 
 It's Pistolvania part two 
 (Vinnie Paz) 
 Yeah, listen 
 I send 'em to God, let him sort 'em out, who gon' burn up? 
 Caught a couple homis, but the bodies never turned up 
 I don't say shit like, "On fleek" or "Turnt up" 
 Embalming on the wakata, all shermed up 
 The new Porsche is a lot faster 
 The blue Avatar face on the Yacht-Master 
 Son got splashed down to bottom, all master 
 Got caught slipping on white like Alabasta 
 It's dark and it's hot, it's about to be cold 
 And these young boys style is about to be old 
 Young boy act Joe, so he have to be told 
 Or have his body dump trucked up academy road 
 Really, fuck rap, I'm about to pull the llama out 
 Fuck the llama, I'mma have to pull the fucking chopper out 
 Air your fucking whole block including your mama out 
 I'm the one to call if you need to bring the drama out 
 Murder

 Cry motherfucker, cry motherfucker, cry 
 Die motherfucker, die motherfucker, die
