Verse 1 - Vinnie Paz: 
 You know that Vinnie spit the flyest shit 
 I'll burn your body in the fire pit 
 I told you back in '96 about the biochip 
 I guess you didn't feel the god and wasn't buying it 
 And now it's time for shit to realign and coincide with it 
 I told you how that they would clone a human being 
 I told you that they share the dough with Europeans 
 I told you that the CIA trained Bin Laden 
 And that the Vatican Catholicism been rotten 
 I told you that the UFOs was real 
 I told you about the crop circles they designed in the field 
 Yeah I tried to teach you about Mumia Jamal 
 Buy y'all ain't listen to me, I'mma see his freedom or fall 
 I tried to tell you about the real reasons for the war 
 And how the old administration steal from the poor 
 And how the world as we know it ain't got much time 
 I guess that I can't make a difference with just one rhyme 
 Verse 2 - Block McCloud: 
 We signed the unsigned, frontline to backdrop 
 Punchlines are cocaine cooked up to crack rock 
 Chopped up, distributed, baselines they sniffing it 
 Place your order, in half a minute delivered it 
 In thirty seconds feel the dirty weapon in your bloodstream 
 Like ultraviolet rays penetrating through the sunscreen 
 Block McCloud raining down, feel the force? 
 Vinnie Paz ready for volcanic eruption 
 Spontaneous combustion inhale the foreign substance 
 Into your soul, fire in the hole, higher than an Empire State 
 While desires to be told is the best kept secret like the pyramids in Egypt 
 Mythic hieroglyphics, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Noah's Ark 
 Historic blown apart, Napoleon complex 
 ? The biggest bomb threat atomic nuclear attack 
 Brooklyn Ac, Jedi Mind Tricks, fuckers read the fine print 
 I told you the underground is over now 
 This the new generation and we hold it down 
 I told you it's Brooklyn Ac and Jedi Minds 
 Ahead of their times, rebels with them devilish rhymes 
 I told you you don't wanna fuck around 
 The boys from the hood that'll stomp you out 
 I told you these little ones is paper thin 
 Fucking with heavyweights ? let the games begin 
 I told you I'm a Baptist, baptize your flock 
 My flows is greater than Moses, capsize your yacht 
 My immortal technique will clap nines at cops 
 Act wise your heart might just flatline and stop 
 I told homie I'll sun you like a tanning salon 
 I warn you it's gonna happen, Bin Laden after the bomb 
 Can't see me in, I'm in caves and caverns 
 Still my crazed chatter is engraved inside your brain's grey matter 
 Send your soul to Jacob's Ladder, could've cashed in the tender 
 Me and Vinnie Pazienza got a plan to make you fags throw 
 Up the flag and surrender, we have an agenda 
 To fight club, got fans that are members, too many cats to remember 
 Revenge of the nerds, murderous pens in my pocket 
 Protector look through the optical lens of a toxic avenger 
 It's the quiet before the storm, enjoy the tropical weather 
 'Cause when we pop it's like the nuclear bombs they drop in the desert 
 Till I achieve my goal I stay writing in peace alone 
 Reading scrolls deeper than anything Jesus knows 
 See the code, the priest foretold the beast would roam 
 From offshores of the beach of Rome 
 A European orphan three sixes burned in a coffin 
 For Vatican cashing in they get a piece of all this 
 Massive building battle stations way out in orbit 
 Satellites catching sights of lifeforms priceless poultry 
 The technology's theirs, the money's corporate 
 They look humanoid but the talk like they dolphins 
 The sonic frequency deafens the human ear 
 I'm not asking you believe, I'm just asking that you adhere 
 My peers, this info is older than life, it's limitless 
 How you think Aztecs created sundials and pyramids? 
 It came from the chariots of fire 
 The Ac and Vinnie Paz casts a sentence of death to the truthless liar 
 I told you the underground is over now 
 This the new generation and we hold it down 
 I told you it's Brooklyn Ac and Jedi Minds 
 Ahead of their times, rebels with them devilish rhymes 
 I told you you don't wanna fuck around 
 The boys from the hood that'll stomp you out 
 I told you these little ones is paper thin 
 Fucking with heavyweights ? let the games begin
