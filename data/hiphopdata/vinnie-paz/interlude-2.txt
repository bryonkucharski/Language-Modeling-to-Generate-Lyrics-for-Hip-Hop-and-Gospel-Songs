Yeah, yeah, as we keep it moving 
 You're listening to the Priest of Bloodshed 
 Vinnie Pazienza 
 Yo word to Allah 
 We in the lab right now working on God of the Serengeti 
 The next solo joint by myself 
 You know I'm sayin'? We in the lab working 
 Big shouts to DJ Premier 
 Big shouts to DJ Muggs 
 Havoc from Mob Deep 
 Prodigy, what's the word (Spanish term) 
 We got a joint together, you know I'm sayin'? Yo DJ Kwestion on the one's and two's 
 On the zigga-zigga 
 Always holdin' me down 
 You're listening to the Priest of Bloodshed 
 Hahahaha
