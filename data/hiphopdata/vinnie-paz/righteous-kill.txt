I'm a fucking thunderstorm, you's a light shower 
 You a bitch, you shoot and miss like Dwight Howard 
 You can't battle the god, I'm too precise coward 
 That's like Khalid Muhammad saying he's White Power 
 This the machete that your organs getting sliced out with 
 The blind motherfucker in the village Bryce Howard 
 My brain only function proper in the night hours 
 You might own a fucking label but the mic ours 
 My shit hi-tech lord like a plastic bomb 
 An asshole, I punch people with glasses on 
 Anybody disagreeable we mashing on 
 I only fuck with green and gold god magic wand 
 An encore is the only thing that you clapping on 
 I'm a pitbull pussy, you a papillon 
 A bitch get a 40 from me, not a glass of Dom 
 I'm the G-29 in the assassin's palm 
 All I hear is danger, all I see is danger 
 All you hear is "run, run, here come danger" 
 Shatter dreams like Freddy your thoughts rearrange ya 
 Stare death dead in the eyes, it'll change ya 
 All I hear is danger, all I see is danger 
 All you hear is "run, run, here come danger" 
 Shatter dreams like Freddy your thoughts rearrange ya 
 Stare death dead in the eyes, it'll change ya 
 It's a righteous kill, I don't do nothing but write and kill 
 Drink 40s, smoke el, push the white and krill 
 I move strong and fast, I have a bison's will 
 I'm the motherfucking champ, I'm the fightin' Phils 
 I'm from the city of the syrup and Vicodin pills 
 From the city the most fearless of fighters was filmed 
 The city where we have the most street veterans still 
 The Moors, Nuwaubians, Five Percenters will build 
 I'm from Philly motherfucker, the rawest it comes 
 I make your body disappear, I'm a sorcerer's tongue 
 You live your whole life in fear that the torture will come 
 I hope my music is revered like a portrait of Pun 
 I'm paranoid god here in my fortress with guns 
 I had a void god, filled it with whores and with blunts 
 I ain't have a choice god, I was born in the slums 
 I ain't have a voice god till I slaughtered the drums 
 Yeah, the four-fifth is a melon popper 
 Hollow tips spin your body like a helicopter 
 Anything can move god if you sell it proper 
 And I've been through more viewings than a teleprompter 
 This is horrorcore beat, got hella monsters 
 My team's got more Gs than a spelling proctor 
 Y'all ain't never moved D, y'all are petty choppers 
 I got a vicious left hook, call me Eddie Thomas 
 But I'm raw with the right hand 
 Like Jack Johnson fighting against the white man 
 Yeah I'm about to shorten your life span 
 Evil shit can be good if it's in the right hands 
 I make motherfuckers burn, you a slight tan 
 I keep a motherfucking urn on my nightstand 
 So wait your motherfucking turn like a hype man 
 I bury you with the snitches under the white sand
