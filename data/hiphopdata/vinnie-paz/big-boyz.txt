 Verse 1 - Vinnie Paz: 
 Can't nobody fuck with you 
 I'm an animal, I should be kept inside a fuckin' zoo 
 You a bitch, your bitch told me she was stuck with you 
 Fuck around with me will get you beat like a production crew 
 I'm Vinnie Paz cousin, who the fuck is you 
 Gun brawl, hand to hand, cousin I will muscle you 
 I used to ride pussy boi for a buck or two 
 Now I hit you with the lama, bodybag duffle you 
 Yeah, I do the type of shit that a thug would do 
 You the type to be in magazines with men huggin' you 
 That's the type of shit that have me snuffin' you 
 Pull the ratchet out and put a slug inside your bubble goose 
 I find your kind of rhyme to be insufferible 
 Put your body in a place where nobody discover you 
 Bring your whole team, all them faggots sucka too 
 Peace to Afu, brotha I'd spill they blood for you
