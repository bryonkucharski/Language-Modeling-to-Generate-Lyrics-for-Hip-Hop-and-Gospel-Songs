Let it be known we too much for these underclassmen 
 Fuck the lights, fuck the cameras, I want the action 
 I want in on anything that can get me money 
 For the root of evil watch how I get ugly 
 Completely famished, hungry is an understatement 
 That's real talk, my words they under investigation 
 I'm never hesitating, too much time is wasting 
 I ain't half-baked, my brain is never vegetating 
 Everybody wanna rap, gotta regulate em 
 Thou shall not spit in my presence, that is my legislation 
 Constant elevation, constant steady pacing 
 Deadly melodies, deadly combinations 
 MCs nowadays heavy population 
 Too many hard-looks, we gotta rock their face in 
 I ain't no Indian, homie I'm a chief rocka 
 Goodfella capo, put you in a meat locker 
 We ain't going nowhere, locked and loaded in here 
 We controlling this here, all of our soldiers is near 
 We ain't going nowhere, locked and loaded in here 
 We controlling this here, all of our soldiers is near 
 December's unholy so cherish the sun slowly 
 The pharaoh inside of a narrow grave, you can't control me 
 If I die nobody hold me, my body would rather be lonely 
 My soul is in purgatory waiting for Satan to scold me 
 If I had to go back into the old me 
 I'd be depressed and distraught from all of the OE 
 I'd rather take a fucking shot of that Cognac 
 Y'all niggas is bottom-feeders, the rest of y'all below that 
 Pharaoh clique man we deep like the Wu was 
 Or really like the Wu is but we be the new buzz 
 A few drugs got you niggas all gassed up 
 MP3s are like M-16s after they pass us 
 Ask for us, Outerspace we salute y'all 
 Only fuck with fam cause y'all be acting all RuPaul 
 My niggas rugged, we carry Louisville Sluggers 
 And we claiming outerspace, ain't a fucking soul above us nigga 
 We ain't going nowhere, locked and loaded in here 
 We controlling this here, all of our soldiers is near 
 We ain't going nowhere, locked and loaded in here 
 We controlling this here, all of our soldiers is near 
 I'ma do what I gotta do to get the gwap 
 And if it's daylight and kids is out I wet they block 
 Young boys, no respect, they will get their pop 
 I'm a G, I'm polite, let me get that aunt (you're a great grand god) 
 My head wrapped like the Iron Sheik 
 And the Desert E have your wig peeled like tires screeching 
 The bullet holes have you dying leaking 
 My beat's savage, it speaks Spanish like I was Rican 
 Y'all last like y'all was culo 
 Son chill all of y'all grill like el a du yo 
 Guns big like they was sumo 
 Let 'em bang, I let 'em hang like they Arturo (Blood and guts warrior baby) 
 I don't call it haze, I call it smog 
 The drug is white girl and I ain't talking Lady Gag 
 Motherfucker I'm nice at mine, y'all nice at yours? 
 The difference is like Nike 4s and Michael Kors
