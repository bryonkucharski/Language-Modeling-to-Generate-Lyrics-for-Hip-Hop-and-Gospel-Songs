(Vinnie Paz) 
 My heart cold like when the sea was frozen 
 Drug supplying and hold the iron like hemoglobin 
 Catch a body on whichever fuckin' beat is chosen 
 Murder the church, left the fuckin' cathedral open 
 Throw a left hook to the ribs leave 'em broken 
 Box game levitate 'em so that Jesus know 'em 
 Walk with God so everyone in Medina know him 
 Y'all are casual rappers I have a deep devotion 
 Speak when spoken to, bitch, you just a snake snitchin' 
 The D supplying, the fiends higher then Blake Griffin 
 I don't wanna hit the bitch but the dame trippin' 
 I call the shot on who move the rock like Lane Kiffin 
 I changed labels but implemented the same system 
 I had to walk through the fire so I could gain wisdom 
 I see life through the same eyes, same vision 
 The watch five figures, lord, and the chain glisten 
 If you wanna problem, Vinnie is a problem 
 And the problem is that I'm a motherfuckin' disease 
 I would never hesitate to pull the pistol out 
 I always got the problem solver with me 
 Makin' money over here makin' money there 
 Seein' places you could never possibly see 
 My crew thick I don't give two shits 
 You can suck my dick you should probably flee 
 (Scarface) 
 I rap like there ain't shit to it I just do it 
 Light you simple niggas and check they ass when they sewage 
 Fuck you if you can't take a joke, shit 
 Smoke this. You broke bitch. Lack of focus get your nose bit 
 Light that ass up then I send you 
 On a mission impossible take flight with my pencil 
 As I enlighten you with shit I done been through 
 The complicated I done make it look simple 
 With one squeeze I leave they head with a dimple 
 And leaky like an old fat bitch on her menstrual 
 You rap style humble I'm still standing 
 As hard as they been making them these days I cans till win 
 Why the fuck you think they call me an OG? 
 The way I handle biz is nothing short of unholy 
 I'm ghostly on the block with my top up 
 Pistol in my lap you shot wrong you gettin' glocked up 
 If you wanna problem with me it's a problem 
 And the problem is that I'm a mutha-fuckin' disease 
 I will never hesitate to pull the pistol out 
 Empty the revolver on you cock it and squeeze 
 Makin' money here makin' money there 
 Seein' places that you could never possibly see 
 One deep in the streets tote heat smoke sweets 
 Take a look at what they calling' a G 
 (Vinnie) 
 The knife work nice, all day gentle carver 
 And I stay on point like a pencil sharpener 
 Matter fact, I'm on point like Tibetan archers 
 Move weight legislate like extended caucus 
 And I know how the game should be locked up 
 I know all the dope fiends veins will be popped up 
 I know that y'all claim to be stocked up 
 Gun work nice, all your brains will be mopped up 
 This beef rearrange your face like collagen 
 Cook jums on the same pot my mamma pasta in 
 I don't play games I just rock your chin 
 You fuck with cops? I never let the impostors in 
 See Vinnie give you a whole clip 
 I'm an artist, blood decorate the whole shit 
 Got knocked, almost did a bid in '06 
 I'm smarter now, that's why I conquered this whole shit 
 If you wanna problem Scarface is a problem 
 And the problem is that I'm a mutha-fuckin' disease 
 I will never hesitate to pull the pistol out 
 Empty the revolver on you cock it and squeeze 
 Makin' money here makin' money there 
 Seein' places that you could never possibly see 
 One deep in the streets tote heat smoke sweets 
 Take a look at what they calling' a G
