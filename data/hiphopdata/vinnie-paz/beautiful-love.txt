I'm out for whatever you wanna call it, cash or paper 
 My only purpose to kill, perfect assassinator 
 I'm on the path of Islam, you on the path of Vader 
 My nickname Buck 50 cousin pass the razor 
 The 750i turn you from a fan to hater 
 Feeling myself like I'm a chronic masturbator 
 I ain't the type of motherfucker you should ask a favour 
 I'm the type of motherfucker that'll blast my neighbour 
 I look at anybody as weak that has a saviour 
 The Israeli Galil will turn your ass to vapour 
 I got an Ingram MAC-11 and it has a laser 
 I got a thing for MAC-11s, not a passive nature 
 Everything I write is war on the pad and paper 
 I don't listen to rap no more, my passion's Slayer 
 My heart is cold as the temperature of a massive glacier 
 I put a giant hole inside you like a massive crater 
 Everywhere I go to ball Paz is strapped 
 I be loading it up, I be cocking it back 
 I ain't in my right mind, I ain't stopping at that 
 I will hit his lifeline in the back of his cap 
 See I'm faster than a motherfucker grabbing his gat 
 Beating me is just illogical imagining that 
 I'm a G you is just a pacifist rat 
 I make bodies disappear like a magical act 
 Yeah, I'm just giving the fans another anthem 
 This is just another example of my expansion 
 I make your top drop like the new Phantom 
 I like to pop shots with my new cannon 
 The left hook wild vicious, I'm a champion 
 You ain't wilding out cousin, that's a tantrum 
 Wild assault rifles, thirty fucking handguns 
 I'm holding all of you motherfuckers for ransom
