Yeah, this is Vinnie Paz. Big Louie Dogs. Vin Laden. 
 Verse 1 - Vinnie Paz: 
 Obama's a fraud, every action is opposite god 
 Line 'em up guillotine, then chop with the sword 
 Anyone who got murked, then I was the cause 
 Who the one who got hurt and died on the cross 
 Not the Jesus that they told you that died 
 He escaped and he hid inside a hole and survived 
 Fuck the pope, he a nazi and I hope that he die 
 I hope that none of y'all listen to his holiness lies, yeah 
 I hope that y'all never trap with the beast 
 I hope that y'all don't have to ever see the savage's teeth 
 They look for flesh and see a ravenous feast 
 I was beasting mothafuckers for they Lazarus piece, yeah 
 I told y'all about my son in a box 
 I told y'all never talk and to run from the cops 
 I told y'all 'bout the jums and the pots 
 The C.I.A. killed Kennedy and put the jums on the blocks
