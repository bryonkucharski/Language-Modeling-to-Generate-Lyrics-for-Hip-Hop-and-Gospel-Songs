I'm Lord Jedi Waves at sixteen 
 Yo, Vinnie, blicky, I'm followed by tranquility 
 My gun cha cha slide like dance floors into sixteens 
 Shoot your Phantom doors off the hinges, I'm spiffy 
 Watch the wave rip, four pound [?] tips 
 My bitch wears strawberry mystics 
 Got double cups for you thirsty niggas, the winners 
 Onslaught, we the Autobots, fuck with us 
 I been fucking these rap niggas' bitches 
 Invictus, Ernest Henley 
 Thank whatever gods may be [?] 
 [?] head, step you gator meat on my feet 
 I embody all the fly shit you wanna be 
 Ask about me, Rose Velours skyhouse me 
 I fucked all the dope boy bitches on my balcony 
 Turn your bitch to a wave slave, Lord Wavey 
 Arm, leg, leg, arm, a bobsled 
 Cool runners, these old hoes, they give the bomb head 
 Barkin' up the wrong tree, parkin' on the wrong street 
 Get your shit, split your wig, lift him up five feet 
 Blow the weed, control the V, cops behind us 
 Must I remind him? The whip be like four hundred horses 
 The meal be like eight courses, black on black forces 
 Fuck the leaky faucet, torch it 
 Water torture, I'm charged with slaughter with it 
 And don't fear, I must be acquitted, invoke the spirits 
 Pen this shit in hieroglyphics, vague specifics 
 Over there on the Pacific, let's get it 
 I hit the brakes, the ground was covered in ice 
 Body smother, demise, head covered in lice 
 Yikes, this shit's disgusting, I know 
 Daily News, Newsday, Huffington Post 
 (Vinnie Paz) 
 When the bulldog bark, pa, everybody cower 
 Discretion is the better part of valor 
 Drunk from the power, drunk from the Amaretto Sour 
 Son got splashed like a shower 
 Listen, I'm telling you I'm the shit 
 The Larry Hughes three time felon of this shit 
 I bust this motherfucker in the melon with the grip 
 The [?] of the Nuwaubian is a gift 
 I splash son, I ain't even know his government 
 The two Glocks twins like Doublemint 
 Y'all on some other shit, all of it's trash, I like none of it 
 Iraq through y'all masters for the fuck of it 
 Y'all on some sucker shit, talking to the feds 
 He singing like Mariah with that warrant on his head 
 This dirt bag swine live in squalor 
 It made all the gunmen holler
