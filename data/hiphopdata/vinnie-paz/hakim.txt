(A.G.) 
 From the Bronx to Philly, only real niggas feel me 
 Sucker-proof is how they built me 
 We outlast trends, pay attention to your friends 
 See me in a train, might see me in a Benz 
 No matter where you see me, I'm official 
 That's without the whistle 
 Even without a pistol, known for launching missiles 
 My air strikes, check these clowns like Air Nikes 
 Your whole team against me and Paz, that's a fair fight 
 Pro-black nigga, even when I wear white 
 We raise the price like fare hikes 
 I just want a clear mic to make sure these niggas hear right 
 The giant, worldwide fans and street clients 
 Put you in a box and call it the sweet science 
 Before you start, we have won 
 That's cause the cloth I'm cut from 
 (A.G.) 
 D.I.T.C (yeah)., AOTP (yeah) 
 Army of the Pharaohs (yeah), known for shooting arrows (yeah) 
 Diggin' in the Crates, have gun, will travel (have gun, will travel) 
 D.I.T.C (yeah)., AOTP (yeah) 
 Army of the Pharaohs (yeah), known for shooting arrows (yeah) 
 Diggin' in the Crates, have gun, will travel (have gun, will travel) 
 (O.C.) 
 It's moments like these when in the zone ain't the word 
 First time my words relate with thirty-three in the third 
 Nerve endings respond to the sound of the drums 
 Taught myself breath control as I can strip my lungs 
 Each line makes sense, I don't just flap my gums 
 Talking loose leaf the target, the pen is my gun 
 Tactician know to reincarnate Isoroku Yamamoto 
 The one responsible for the attack on Pearl Harbor 
 Die hard bloggers love getting the followers 
 To start commentaries 'bout whose shit's magnanimous 
 Character traits of funny style artists 
 Get the taste smacked out of they mouth for spitting garbage 
 The solution for half-wits, we solve it 
 Toss little pumpkin bombs like Green Goblin 
 Take the heads of so-called kings that sip wine from a goblet 
 Looting cash just for they profits 
 (A.G.)

 Diggin' in the Crates, have gun, will travel (have gun, will travel)

 Listen 
 And while they blood clot, all of y'all swimming with sharks 
 And the closest one to you, he be living with narcs 
 Everybody have a choice, but you live in the dark 
 And with this bulldog, ain't nobody live when it barks 
 Every rhyme is a very small glimpse in the dark 
 And these dumb-dumbs going to put a rip in your heart 
 I don't waste time money, I'm efficient with art 
 I was leaving Jordan, three foot prints in the park 
 You talk a lot, ock, and you ain't got the nerve 
 The four pound milli' silly, but the Glock absurd 
 I've been rocking Philly all the way to Gothenburg 
 Copped the bird and distribute it until I got the word (¡Qué rico chico!) 
 Half moon, park, God, dark fade 
 Armor on all y'all, car wash, car sprayed 
 D.I.C.I., happy that we parlayed 
 Callaway went thataway, Pa Clark Gabe
