(Block McCloud) 
 We live by the assassin's creed committing dastardly deeds 
 Slash and you bleed, we live in the cut 
 It's like we have a fucking disease 
 A virus, violence begets violence, you're drowned in a river of blood 
 And all you bastards can plead for mercy and cry, you're buried alive 
 Nobody's digging you up 
 It's like we have a fucking disease 
 A virus, violence begets violence, you're drowned in a river of blood 
 (Kool G Rap) 
 Weak niggas surviving with an IQ level low 
 My shit rock like 2Pac or Os on a ghetto stove 
 My flows will leave 'em weak, you see the rose petals blow 
 Gun smoke settles slow when I blow the cold metal nose 
 Like holding recelos, Bacardi and bezel glow 
 Dressed in dough, the boy covered in ice like an Eskimo 
 Lay one of you kids, I'm in child molester mode 
 Trying to follow his tracks I'll derail your train of thought 
 And afford you one female in the same assault 
 Stainless fork, flame the pork with a grain of salt 
 Vinnie Paz, semi mags, who want to claim to talk? 
 Address your shit like Jimmy Jazz, so put your frame in park 
 The black stallion, Italiano, gangsters walk 
 This arcane, we off the chain, the links'll talk 
 I get all in the bitch head like a shrink, of course 
 You half-steppin' and ass-bettin', the bank is off

 (Vinnie Paz) 
 You tryna sell wolf tickets to the lion of the jungle 
 I'm the eyes of God, they call me cyanide in the struggle 
 You the kind of guys that would be traumatized in the scuffle 
 And I'm buying pies with the Italian guys with the muscle 
 I'm dying before I trust you, the iron inside the duffel 
 You on Rikers Island, I can get homicidal to touch you 
 I'm inside, I'm viral, I'm the messiah's idol above you 
 I'm the pride of Cairo, I'm genocidal and I will cut you 
 I'm riding for all my hustlers and anybody building bridge 
 It's no mercy and Pazienza I will kill the kids 
 Blood diamonds, Sierra Leone is really big 
 The G36 slick, it'll peel your wig 
 If it ain't the 36, then I'll let the 9 explode 
 I knew about collapsing buildings before Osama knows 
 I create beef, Vinnie always finds a foe 
 Bitches up and down on my dick like I'm the Konami code
