Yeah 
 Yo E, what up God? 
 Stomping in the forty below troopers and all that 
 Triple fat goose jackets 
 Know what I mean? 
 Alright listen 
 Come on 
 Yeah 
 Yeah there's a rumble and money got crushed into rubble 
 For fakin' the funk inside the concrete jungle 
 DJ Eclipse on the cut with Bill with him 
 Sucker MCs well you can go to hell with him 
 Well this is a war here, it's Vietnam here 
 The five percent Nation of Brothers of Allah here 
 Whether he good or not, you soft as a Pudding Pop 
 He ain't halal, but he got cut in the butcher shop 
 You can't touch the mic, you don't deserve to 
 If he didn't learn too, then he getting burned too 
 The Kings and Queens are rebuilding they throne 
 With hardcore drums that's as ill as J-Zone 
 Suckers are petrol, so they better let go 
 'Cause I'm the human lightning bolt like Electro 
 Y'all ain't stepping up, cause y'all ain't deaf'n up 
 Yo, DJ Eclipse just cut the record up 
 You laid in the dirt and got put into a hearse 
 Suckers try to battle but they get they heads burst 
 Aye, y'all couldn't move me, I cut 'em like sushi 
 The word is a gun and it'll spray like an Uzi 
 I built with the Gods until knowledge is born on 'em 
 It took a little while for the science to dawn on 'em 
 You fade like a barber, my blade was just sharper 
 The Son that was born was the same as the Father 
 None of y'all could come before me or come after me 
 You fucking with Paz then it could be a catastrophe 
 Knowledge is infinite, you couldn't live with it 
 Suckers will fade and get played like an instrument 
 Nothing can harm me, why try bomb me? 
 You couldn't fuck around with Paz with the Army 
 Thirty-two bars of death will shut 'em up 
 DJ Eclipse on the wheel, so cut it up
