(Vinnie Paz) 
 Yeah, yeah 
 One, two, Pistol Gang Pazzy 
 Buckwild, D.I.T.C., come on 
 (Vinnie Paz) 
 This an empty place bol, trust me, don't go there 
 The Jezebel dwell there, way to many hoes there 
 It's not for everybody, so you shouldn't poke your nose there 
 The watch say Panerai, the sweater say, "Mohair." 
 If Five-O ask you where you going, say, "Nowhere." 
 Mind your fucking B-I, I'm trying to make some dough here 
 Trying to make moves and you fucking up my flow here 
 Asking for an answer when you know nobody know here 
 We ran up into Macy's 'cause they had a lot of Lo. there 
 Thirty deep, rent-a-cop screaming that it's no fair 
 We was boosting everything from Tommy Hil. to Wu-Wear 
 Prada wasn't even on my mind 'cause I was new there 
 Ask Ramona Africa, she'll tell you not to move here 
 When OG worked the tower, he would let us boost there 
 It's like they had us locked inside a zoo and let us loose there 
 A bunch of fucking animals that have our fucking roots here 
 (Eamon) 
 The weak get overthrown when animals are home 
 When you realize you're all alone 
 Boy, you better hide that hungry you 
 When you realize you're all alone 
 (Vinnie Paz) 
 Yeah, this is an empty place bol, trust me, don't walk there 
 Or you gon' end up with your body lined in chalk there 
 Keep your head down and don't even try to talk there 
 Anybody don't belong there, in the dark there 
 When papi run up on you, best believe you take a loss there 
 They playing Aventura while they got you in their crosshair 
 If you ain't trying to run it, then we taking it by force here 
 And I ain't gotta problem telling you that I'm the boss here 
 It's a place in the road that people call the fork there 
 One is living righteous and the other serving pork there 
 You gon' get vicked if you dumb enough to floss here 
 Muhfuckers out here, addicted to the warfare 
 We carry baseball bats, but ain't no fucking park here 
 I had to take an F because they charged me with assault here 
 Silencio papa, there's way too many narcs here 
 Especially when I'm 'bout to let this bulldog bark here 
 (Eamon) 
 The weak get overthrown when animals are home 
 When you realize you're all alone 
 Boy, you better hide that hungry you 
 When you realize you're all alone 
 (Vinnie Paz) 
 Yeah, Pack Pistol Pazzy 
 Yo, Buckwild, what's the word papa? 
 D.I.T.C., yeah, yeah, yeah 
 You muhfuckers don't want war
