(Vinnie Paz) 
 One, two 
 Yo, Oh No, what up papa? 
 Yeah, sun still shine, you nah mean? 
 I call my brother sun 'cause he shine like one 
 You nah mean? 
 Pack Pistol Pazzy 
 Pistol Gang Pazienza 
 Listen 
 (Vinnie Paz) 
 Carefully wrote L's, I order [?] liquor 
 Son talked loud and he died with a whimper 
 Shooters in the cut like they hold a [?] scissor 
 The [?] watch is in the toxified liver 
 You need somebody popped? We'll rock for five figures 
 For less we could touch him and leave him alive limbless 
 Giant Rambo knife all of y'all bitches 
 Gut a muh'fucker, par, lie with the fishes 
 Allah word always gon' justify the Deen (Dīn) 
 Especially since the end gon' justify the mean 
 This the confession of revelation of a king 
 The most high, whole dedication to the ring 
 The orientation and resurrection of the queen 
 The glorification and insurrection of the being 
 Every variety of thought is obscene 
 The falsehood lies in the walls of the dream 
 Yeah 
 ((X2): Jakk Frost) 
 Niggas out of line, then we hit 'em with them thangs 
 You can see the blood still dripping from my fangs 
 First you hear the click-click, then you hear the bang 
 Then you hear the bang, bang, bang 
 (Vinnie Paz) 
 No high hopes, so there's no disappointment 
 Just another fly in the ointment 
 Y'all are like poison, this is why the TEC stay pointed 
 Emphatically non-cypher and disjointed 
 Them jump out boys will smoke to stay noited 
 Fam got jammed on the lamb and they [?] 
 Tried to keep peace and got stuck in the middle 
 When son got touched, I got tucked for a little 
 The Pyrex like Benihana when the white cooking 
 The K-Frame turned his brain into rice pudding 
 We tried sight to the blind, but the night took him 
 We stay high like a 95' Dwight Gooden [?] 
 I reorganize a circumvent still 
 The banishing ritual of the pentagram real 
 It's always in accordance with something that y'all feel 
 Magical philosophy, something that y'all kill 
 Yeah 
 ((X2): Jakk Frost) 
 Niggas out of line, then we hit 'em with them thangs 
 You can see the blood still dripping from my fangs 
 First you hear the click-click, then you hear the bang 
 Then you hear the bang, bang, bang
