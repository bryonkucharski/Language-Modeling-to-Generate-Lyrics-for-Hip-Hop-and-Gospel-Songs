(Ransom) 
 I'm verbally generous, every word it be effortless 
 Specialist when penning this, I'm just playing all the percentages 
 Staying raw with the menaces, play the part of a chemisist 
 Mixing deadly words and making 'em venomous, remember this 
 Wasn't raised with the etiquette since the days of a Genesis 
 Now I benefit, 'cause the game is back in its Genesis 
 I'm reacting like Emmitt Smith, fourth quarter 
 Two minutes left and this here is a tall order 
 It's more slaughter, farewells and "Our Fathers" 
 Say a prayer, the day is here that you walked water 
 From your corner they talk Sodom, but no Gomorrah 
 So who's sane to think that our people is more poorer? 
 A more father, niggas running from court orders 
 I'm used to niggas with tall goals that fall shorter 
 (Vinnie Paz) 
 Every time I see you, you be where the narcs park 
 Spray his fucking wheel like Con Art, that's always the hard part 
 You should stay quiet when the God bark 
 Every gun I carry, nose bigger than an aardvark 
 The only way to get 'em is to get 'em when the car start 
 With the combination of skill and cunning of card sharks 
 Vinnie let them dogs bark, then you see a large spark 
 I'm a fucking lion, I suffer from an enlarged heart 
 Put 'em where it's all dark, vomit and piss 
 And I only fuck with noodles if he promise me chips 
 'Cause I always gotta have like twenty-thou' on my wrist 
 With a bitch that exist, suck, swallow, and dip 
 I'm the one that you rappers call when you want raw 
 Have a bunch of young bulls aiming at your front door 
 This the twelfth round and y'all are standing on sacred ground 
 Take the pound and teach you workers how you should break it down
