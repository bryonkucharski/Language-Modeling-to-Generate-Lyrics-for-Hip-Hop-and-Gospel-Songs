King Kong, ain't got shit on me! 
 Verse 1 - Apathy: 
 Bring out the apes the gorillas the monkeys the junkies 
 Half money half bummy half genius half dummy 
 Dirty, slutty, bloody, muddy, filthy fuck buddy 
 If you're stupid you should study how I'm steady making money 
 Like I'm Steady B, Freddy Krueger, bald as Lex Luthor 
 Spark buddha, pick a public park become a sharpshooter 
 Chop an off-duty cop up into chop suey 
 Channeling Tupac through me (hock tui) damn I'm such a glock groupie 
 Bad grammar, bad manners, bad hammers, bad mama jama hammer boppin 
 Got your grandma yellin' like she's Janice Joplin, I'm joshin 
 Please get off my johnson, I see you bitches jockin this jargon that I'm jotting 
 I'm Jesus a genius a G I'm a genie 
 Grantin bitches wishes if they wish is for my pee pee 
 I'm greazy and greedy and creepy and freaky and skeevy 
 Your breezy, but fuck me for a CD 
 They are very very dangerous, they are wild animals 
 Something's got to be done 
 Chorus - Vinnie Paz: 
 Look at all this wild shit y'all got me on 
 With fire arms now it's on like Honkey Kong 
 Where my gorillas at? Where my apes at? 
 Where my gorillas at? Where my apes at? 
 Look at all this wild shit y'all got me on 
 They play this song and it's on like Honkey Kong 
 Where my gorillas at? Where my apes at? 
 Where my gorillas at? Where my apes at?
