*Scratching* 
 Things are done different in my zip code 
 If you think I'm joking you're sadly mistaken 
 You wanna rumble? Well you can get crumbled 
 Today will be the grand opening of your chest 
 Things are done different in my zip code 
 If you think I'm joking you're sadly mistaken 
 You wanna rumble? Well you can get crumbled 
 Today will be the grand opening of your chest 
 Verse 1 - Doap Nixon: 
 Yo we done told you that we out on the frontline 
 Now the money's coming, niggas eating like lunchtime 
 Pazmania, Reef the Tazmanian, nickelbag niggas ain't know I'm half-Ukrainian 
 They slept on Sour Diesel like retards 
 But this one's the second coming of Isa 
 Ain't got to tell you about the hoods that I'm running at 
 But come with that shit, get your wig piece mummy-wrapped 
 The backyard's where the money's at 
 You have to have to tell your friend's mom her son ain't coming back 
 That's that shit that I'm talking about 
 You trying to make it out the hood, ain't nobody trying to walk it out 
 It's grand opening, everybody's smoking it 
 My Cali niggas locing it, Pharaoh niggas focusing 
 And I ain't in this for the brizzels my nig 
 But anybody wanna beef I'm pistol-whipping their kids 
 Verse 2 - Reef The Lost Cauze: 
 Grand opening, grand closing 
 I box with metal gloves son the hands golden 
 I pop whoever stand closest 
 I rock thousands across oceans 
 I'm refreshed and I'm focused 
 I'm the dopest next to my brother Doap it's 
 OPG, hit you like a swarm of locusts 
 And we don't even deal with promoters 
 Just send us the deposit and tell us what time the doughs is 
 I'm not apologetic about how I said it 
 How powerful the set is or the bar and how high I set it 
 It's how I get it, laugh when they ask debit or credit 
 Then reach in my pocket, proceed to peel lettuce 
 Let us bow our heads and rejoice in the light 
 It's Lost Cauze the most powerful voice on the mic 
 And that's not for discussion, don't be making assumptions 
 That's when I Steve Young 'em, eight straight to the stomach 
 Verse 3 - Vinnie Paz: 
 You sleeping with the enemy, that's who you in bed with 
 I'll put your brain matter back to the edge of the desert 
 Y'all ain't never gonna win, you just a contestant 
 The 40 cal dumb loud and bust your intestines 
 You see it's cold on the dark streets 
 You a corner store rapper, I'm an artiste 
 We Official Pistol Gang and we all beasts 
 I love blood, I don't cook, it's a raw feast 
 But y'all know how that go 
 Boriquas, morenos told me that I'm a natural 
 So I walked in the booth and went wacko 
 Murdered anybody that ever wanted to battle 
 I love bitches but they get on my nerves 
 That's the reason that I send 'em OT for the birds 
 They can take the L for me or I beat 'em with words 
 You can catch me chilling on the balc and see what to serve yeah
