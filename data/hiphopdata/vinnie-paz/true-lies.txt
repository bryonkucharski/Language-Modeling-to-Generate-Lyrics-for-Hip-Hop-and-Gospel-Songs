(Intro: Clip from Network) 
 I want you to get mad! I don't want you to protest, I don't want you to riot, I don't want you to write to your congressman because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write. I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime on the street. All I know is that first you've got to get mad! You've got to say, "I'm a human being, goddamnit! My life has value!" 
 Start the uprising 
 We'll start the uprising 
 It's time to uprise 
 It's time to uprise 
 Verse 1 - Block McCloud: 
 Listen people they got us believing we're nothing 
 But heathens screaming hating each other for nothing but breathing 
 Hating each other for colour and creed when me and you 
 We one and the same under the blade you cut and you bleed 
 And they think we dumb and naive 
 But we wasn't conceived yesterday 
 We know that AIDS they made up the disease 
 And they tease us with money and greed and make us hunger and feed 
 Off each other like some blood-sucking freaks 
 And the most ignorant nigga's a publisher's dream 
 Nothing but whores and infidelity is up on the screen 
 Real chance of love with a slut and a creep 
 A lover that cheats, these dumb broads should be running the streets 
 If you think that letting your daughters watching Charm School 
 Won't harm you or her in the long run you're a darn fool 
 It's so blatant how they raping our minds 
 In plain sight taking our rights, dignity, it ain't right 
 Let's start the uprising 
 It's time to cut ties with these fucking guys that's feeding us nothing but lies 
 It's time to uprise 
 Rise up time's up 
 'Cause when the trust dies, love dies like government spies 
 Let's start the uprising 
 It's time to cut ties with these fucking guys that's feeding us nothing but lies 
 It's time to uprise 
 Rise up time's up 
 'Cause when the trust dies, love dies like government spies 
 Verse 2 - Vinnie Paz: 
 I'll admit that Obama had me believing the hype 
 But after doing the knowledge I ain't been sleeping at night 
 Probably the biggest deception I ever seen in my life 
 If y'all don't read between the lines then y'all ain't reading it right 
 Yeah Vinnie Paz just a motherfucking trooper stepping 
 Nuclear anxiety and the cold of the super weapon 
 Obama and Bush cousins and that's a true connection 
 Seizing power and property like a ruthless henchman 
 I'm in the Jewish temple on Mount Zion 
 Studying literature from the Priory of Sion 
 Nothing's safe, no cars, no planes to fly on 
 I got a few bulletproof vests to try on 
 Yeah but y'all can just remain the machine 
 It's true lies but I decide to stay on my deen 
 You a sucker if you think that the economy kill 
 Barack Obama 666 finally revealed 
 Let's start the uprising 
 It's time to cut ties with these fucking guys that's feeding us nothing but lies 
 It's time to uprise 
 Rise up time's up 
 'Cause when the trust dies, love dies like government spies 
 Let's start the uprising 
 It's time to cut ties with these fucking guys that's feeding us nothing but lies 
 It's time to uprise 
 Rise up time's up 
 'Cause when the trust dies, love dies like government spies 
 Let's start the uprising 
 It's time to cut ties with these fucking guys that's feeding us nothing but lies 
 It's time to uprise 
 Rise up time's up 
 'Cause when the trust dies, love dies like government spies 
 It's true lies
