(Slaine:) 
 Make room for the heavyweight villain with foul language 
 Formally known as low-class but now I'm distinguished 
 Hold that, corner to corner no room for foreigners 
 Coroners performing their craft daily 
 There's a war and it's morbid 
 Twenty-four and it's ease to close at his own wake 
 Our chest plates, filled with ice cold hearts that don't break 
 Respect my g's, fouls and rejects 
 Respect those bullets bloody bullies battle for respect 
 Any cities up inside of this northeast corridor 
 We sported quarters of raw imported all from Florida 
 Now the whole block's flooded with cut coke 
 We don't stop leaving youngins gutted, it's cut-throat 
 Sometimes I'm rolling dolo in a stolen polo 
 But I'm still true to my crew I'm never going solo 
 All these cold winter nights that keep the ice in my blood 
 I'll spill the guts out of this bitch and ditch a knife in the mud

 It's Pazienza, Coka, goon music listen 
 Stick you for the only pot you got to piss in 
 Vinnie P. put the key in the ignition 
 When we get back lord, we shine and glisten 
 It's Pazienza, Coka, goon music listen 
 Stick you for the only pot you got to piss in 
 Vinnie P. put the key in the ignition 
 When we get back lord, we shine and glisten 
 (Vinnie Paz:) 
 Respect my G, y'all sound nervous 
 Respect everything that I do or found murdered 
 Y'all servents, y'all blind without purpose 
 Stay high walking with guns without permits 
 Snake bite came in my life with foul serpent 
 Amaryte blind from birth lord, he worthless 
 All of y'all signs of ignorance is earthless 
 All of my mind is viligance and churchless 
 I don't want to splash Ack 'cause Allah made him 
 And I don't want the faggot P.O. to violate him 
 AR-15 big it'll annihilate him 
 You ain't ever gonna eat this is starvation 
 Try to sell wolf tickets, feed Allah bacon 
 Try to bite the hand that feeds y'all, violation 
 Pussy boi get spotted like dalmatian 
 Look for God in wrong place so he found Satan

 It's the Coka Nos', Louie Dogs, murder music listen 
 Stick you for the only pot you got to piss in 
 Cult leader put the key in the ignition 
 Bottle in my lap, full throttle twisted 
 It's the Coka Nos', Louie Dogs, murder music listen 
 Stick you for the only pot you got to piss in 
 Cult leader put the key in the ignition 
 Bottle in my lap, full throttle twisted 
 (Ill Bill:) 
 I'm like exploding bullet in a clip 
 Like a rock of crack in a capsule 
 Like Galactus eat planets then travel backwards through black holes 
 Run towards conflict, pray for dissipation 
 Guns talk constant, enslaving civilizations 
 So we walk like Egyptian pharaeohs worshiping sun Ra 
 Walk up to your window with the barrels and dump shots 
 Pump four in your lung, slumped over in blood 
 Stuck over some crumbs, fucked over and done 
 I teach a crash course in brain surgery 
 So I don't need no passports to orchestrate murder sprees 
 Show you nothing changed, more than when the casket drop 
 I'll blow your fucking face off like maskatron 
 Pop you while you're driving make you crash your car 
 Drop acid, yeah, tell you who to drop the acid on 
 Look what the uzi do, empty pews and anger god 
 Shoot your funeral, tell me who to drop the casket on

 This is Slaine homie goon, chasing goon music listen 
 This is the only pot I ever had to piss in 
 The odds against me Imma fight with my own hands 
 These are the words I've been writing as a grown man
