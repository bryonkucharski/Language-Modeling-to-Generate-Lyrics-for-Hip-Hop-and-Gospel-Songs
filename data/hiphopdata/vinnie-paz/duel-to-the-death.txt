Can't nobody fuck around with VP 
 Or else you're gonna find yourself D-E-A-D 
 Y'all ain't got your eye on the prize, you can't see 
 'Cause I ain't really livin' my life for Plan B 
 Anybody brave enough to come against me 
 Gonna find your body in the bottom of the Dead Sea 
 How dare you ever in your live walk past me 
 Without acknowledging this man as G-O-D 
 I always been here, always been deranged focus 
 The heat is always in my hand like chain smokers 
 Hard work, dedication and sustained dopeness 
 Bust a motherfucker's head till his brain opens 
 Stay cookin' in the kitchen like we hasta frito 
 I was always smoking wakata with poppy people 
 I ain't never doing anything that's not illegal 
 Read the Torah lord, black mask, black evil 
 This is duel to the death, this is murder, death, kill 
 Stay real, because the sun can't chill 
 M-O-B-B, ain't nobody playin' 'round 
 Vinnie P-P, fuck around, lay around 
 I'll have you laid out, Posturepedic 
 Before the day's out, somebody gon' be layin' bleedin' 
 Keep fuckin' with me, bring me to the darker side 
 Where the wolves play and nothing but your calm alive 
 Get it back tenfold, yeah, I do you dirty 
 I'm in my dirty dirties, that means I'm past the worry 
 I got it mapped out, every plan hashed out 
 Perfectly executed, squeeze till I'm fresh out 
 I got goonies, all they do is stick their neck out 
 For a nigga, cause his loyalty is nothing less 
 And when it's on, you know they got them toolies on deck 
 What you looking at, boy? You made of bullshit 
 Infamous, yeah, we celebrate life 
 Pour liquor for the dead, kill niggas on sight 
 When they get beside themselves, we run up right upon 'em 
 Leave 'em where they stand and pour some fuckin' liquor on 'em 
 This is duel to the death, this is murder, death, kill 
 Stay real, because the sun can't chill 
 M-O-B-B, ain't nobody playin' 'round 
 Vinnie P-P, fuck around, lay around 
 This is duel to the death, this is murder, death, kill 
 Stay real, because the sun can't chill 
 M-O-B-B, ain't nobody playin' 'round 
 Vinnie P-P, fuck around, lay around 
 Let me start from the beginning at the top of the list 
 First off, nobody can do it like this 
 No matter how hard you try, hard you go 
 No matter how hard your beats, ill your flow 
 Can't fuck with P, yeah, this we know 
 I'm not a rapper, I'm a master of ceremonial 
 Gatherings at venues is jam-packed 
 Fuck rap, I'm in it for cream and that's that 
 Tryna stop my dough? I run you off the map 
 Tryna stop my life? I'll blow you out your hat 
 The most thuggish, the most ruggish 
 The most AKAs you heard of is 
 Bandanna, banana clip, RIP 
 I can't help it, my career can't see 
 My name don't wear out, I go on forever 
 That other shit a passing fad, it won't ever
