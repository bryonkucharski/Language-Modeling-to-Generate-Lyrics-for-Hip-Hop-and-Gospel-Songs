(Men voices) 
 Esta es mi familia (This is my family) 
 Por ella doy la vida (That's why I die for) 
 Por ella vivo y por ella muero (That's why I live and die for) 
 (Vinnie Paz) 
 Yo, Oh No, what up papa? 
 This that slime shit 
 R.I.P. Sean Price

 Love, peace, and fight for '93 
 Let 'em know Pazzy 
 (Vinnie Paz) 
 Removed by the council of the masters of a teacher 
 The process went much deeper, I'm a believer 
 I turn batiman body into ether 
 The fellow sufferer who want to stand to God, neither 
 Son talked wild and they popped him like Don Diva 
 I told my shooter not to put the body on a visa 
 The son beast need more base, I called Giza 
 Marc Anthony knew a death before Caesar 
 Give 'em the business and then send 'em to where the ghost is at 
 Armed heavenly arm, Gucci over the shoulder strap 
 Where my fucking soldiers at? All over Jehovah map 
 Make the toaster clap and put two to your spine like Moses back 
 This how you supposed to rap, how you fucking roast a track? 
 This is where fiction and non-fiction can overlap 
 Fronting like you ain't intimidated, but you know it's that 
 A worker just a worker, so tell me where the all the coka at 
 It's that wise older brother, the murderous raspy voice 
 They waiting for what I spit, MCs get dealt with 
 That's why somebody got to bleed 
 You should've let me chill, leave me be 
 It's that wise older brother, the murderous rapping voice 
 They waiting for what I spit, MCs get dealt with 
 That's why somebody got to bleed 
 So calm down clown 'fore I bring the pound down 
 (Vinnie Paz) 
 Enscribed in a cunieform text on a cylinder 
 And Babylon was forced to shoot it out like Dillinger 
 They talk of revolution, but nobody is willing to 
 The way to deal with Lady Liberty is by killing her 
 A wise man said, "A good scotch never spoils" 
 The same man said, "A watched pot never boils" 
 I had every intention to rock, but it got foiled 
 The cavemen still can't live on hot soil 
 The PSA cage just slashed 'em in the vestibule 
 The brain matter looked like vegetables 
 My philosophy of living isn't too technical 
 The Yves Saint Laurent is ready to wear reputable 
 The Desert E .50 cal big as a rhinoceros 
 The four sided monument, they call it, "Black Obelisk" 
 Pressing it in every cell of the body like phosphorus 
 I don't do it simply, it's simply God consciousness 
 It's that wise older brother, the murderous raspy voice 
 They waiting for what I spit, MCs get dealt with 
 That's why somebody got to bleed 
 You should've let me chill, leave me be 
 That wise older brother, the murderous rapping voice 
 They waiting for what I spit, MCs get dealt with 
 That's why somebody got to bleed 
 So calm down clown 'fore I bring the pound down 
 (Man voice) 
 Nosotros decíamos que había tres caminos nada más para la ganga 
 Era: cárcel, muerte y hospital 
 Sabemo' que somo' gangsters 
 Sabemo' que somo' locos 
 Sabemo' que lo tiramos por todo 
 Por el todo por nuestra ganga 
 ¡Y por ella vamos a morir! ¡¿Ah?! 
 ¡Y por ella estamos viviendo!
