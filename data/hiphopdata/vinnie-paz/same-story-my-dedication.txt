They say that things just cannot grow 
 Beneath the winter snow 
 And so I have been told 
 You came into my mother's life at the right time 
 More than a step-father, more of like a lifeline 
 She ain't really had happiness since my pop died 
 She was living but living is always not alive 
 And my momma should be treated like a queen 
 You gave her everything she ever needed like a queen 
 Probably the most gentle G I ever seen 
 The love y'all shared I never seen in human beings 
 Y'all were together twelve years, never no fights 
 Not even a little argument, that was so nice 
 Three of us eating dinner together most nights 
 Working seven days a week, that ain't no life 
 But never once did I hear you complain 
 Even when they let you go never hear you with blame 
 It take a real man to walk through the rain 
 He was a real man who got sick and fought through the pain 
 They say that things just cannot grow 
 Beneath the winter snow 
 And so I have been told 
 They say we're very far 
 Just like a distant star 
 I simply cannot hold 
 I walked in that morning and knew something was wrong 
 I tried to talk to you Rock, you didn't respond 
 I called 9-1-1 and then ran for my moms 
 Waiting for the ambulance and I tried to be calm 
 Moms went with you, I stayed and held down the fort 
 I was nervous, I was crying and really distraught 
 I was alone by myself, just left with my thoughts 
 Mommy called, told me that you had a stroke and fought 
 I ain't seen a hospital since my father died 
 I don't like it there, memories is locked inside 
 When I walked inside the room we started to cry 
 I was just so happy that you was alive 
 And you told you how much that you hate the hospital 
 And that they thieves are trying to keep their pockets full 
 I think I hold myself a little bit responsible 
 When you was smoking all the time I wasn't stopping you 
 Nevertheless you came home and that was real 
 A lot of therapy and doctors gave you lots of pills 
 You couldn't drive anymore, you had to stop and chill 
 And that's too much for anybody that can stop your will 
 But you never got back to your norm 
 You was proud, didn't want any help from my mom 
 I left for tour and you asked me how long I'd be gone 
 And I could see inside your eyes you knew something was wrong 
 I got back mommy told me you was sick again 
 Couldn't believe that we was going through this shit again 
 I love you Rock and I'm always gonna miss you friend 
 And for me it's just the same story, different pen 
 They say that things just cannot grow 
 Beneath the winter snow 
 And so I have been told 
 They say we're very far 
 Just like a distant star 
 I simply cannot hold [2x]
