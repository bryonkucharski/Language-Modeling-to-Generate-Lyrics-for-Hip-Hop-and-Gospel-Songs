It's not a possibility you could ever survive 
 That's just the logicality of the Devil inside 
 Any ounce of goodness in me was never revived 
 Disconnected or completely connected with God 
 The hell-hound spellbound where destiny lie 
 The bells sound, knelt down, the effigy cry 
 A couple rappers want a beef they respectfully die 
 They ended up losing they teeth, but I left them alive 
 I clash with skull in one hand, the other a spine 
 I snap a motherfucker head, he dead on the dime 
 I carve a muh'fucker up like Geppetto with knives 
 That's the magic of the Persian and Arab design 
 That's the marriage of exertion, inertia defined 
 That's the savage that was perfectly nurtured in time 
 I put pacifists in caskets, my version of crime 
 I'm an assassin and my passion is bursting your mind 
 Sirens and ambulances in the streets, there's race, riots and panthers 
 And cops hosing down innocent bystanders 
 Hand grenades and shanks, automatic bullets, pray to the banks 
 Government emergency military sending in tanks 
 How did I get in this position? 
 I'm sick of living, Kevorkian vision 
 And bridge jumpin', razor blade wrists slittin' 
 In the car garage carbon monixide sniffin' 
 Wine glass full of cyanide sippin' 
 Russian roulette, the chamber's spinnin' 
 Death by my own manslaughter 
 I'm going out like Ernest Hemingway and his sister 
 And his brother and his father and his granddaughter 
 Society losing religion, there's too much heat in Lucifer's kitchen 
 Never know if a politician's speaking truth or fiction 
 You spit with true conviction you'll be the victim of a crucifixion 
 The hangman will leave you from a noose swinging and ruin your mission 
 Not every punk on the street is recordable 
 These snitches will start singing and turn the police precinct into a musical 
 Most these thugs is snitching ass cowards 
 You ain't nothing but somebody's bitch in prison getting dick in the showers 
 Too many sleeping on me like narcolepsy, my weapon arsenal is deadly 
 I'm deathly and honest they ain't ever market it correctly 
 Piss on the pavement in the public, jerk my dick on the Fox News 
 Police piss me off, I'll pull it out and piss on they cop shoes, come on 
 You gonna turn this robbery to a homicide 
 The Desert Eagle is lethal, evil personified 
 Dominicans here take you for a dollar ride 
 You want beef you gonna lose god stop his vibe 
 I don't respect life, pussy if you die, you die 
 Most high, Rastafar-I, eye and eye 
 I'm always gonna keep it gutter like a five and dime 
 And when I die the prophecy gonna stay alive 
 Yeah, and y'all should study all the things that's written 
 About the Roman Empire and the Kings of Britain 
 Merlin exists and manuscripts have been forbidden 
 And understand that King James is a piece of fiction 
 My box game like Mantova 
 I'm no fool, I'm old school like my grandfather 
 Ain't nobody take my punch that can stand conscious 
 Psychologically imbalanced, I'm a man's conscience
