Verse 1 - Ill Bill: 
 Apocalypse, the angel of death, the octopus 
 The two-headed eagle, thirty-third degree Hebrew 
 I speaks Mossad, Hamas, and the Hezbollah 
 And the CIA-funded Guatemala terror squads 
 The Pentagon's the TV producer, the war's the product 
 And the media's the salesperson hustling consumers 
 Global instability, terror networks, embassy bombings 
 A thousand ways to get the century popping 
 When mobs of people storm the neighbourhood banks 
 Riots in Time Square paralyzed by suicide bombings and tanks 
 Confined to evil, rides are regal 
 Emperors are ripped from their thrones by the people and then shot in their cerebral 
 One got away, created an empire made of fire 
 Now he crying that the CIA made him wear a wire 
 Now he getting waterboarded up with some pliers 
 Pulling out his fingernails every time he tell a lie 
 Pyramids of Mars AKA Kill Devil Hills

 Criminal official walk through with limited edition pistols 
 The symbolism twist you when the clips hit you

 Verse 2 - B-Real: 
 So many notches in my belt of the victims I have accumulated 
 I got a vision, the light in my head illuminated 
 Your mind's scattered and broken and battered 
 So what does it matter that a rat-ass bastard fell down Jacob's ladder? 
 I climbed the pyramid and punch him in the eyeball 
 Give him a black eye, take a picture with my iPhone 
 Now his eye swolled ripping out my sidearm 
 They don't like me, I'm ghetto, I spit and get my high on 
 Tell the truth a lot, been in this booth a lot 
 Keeping it raw whether I'm in a bad mood or not 
 Open your mind with the venomous rhyme? 
 Lines born in a cypher, you asked for a square deal 
 You see me grinning, your head is spinning 
 The symbolism is just like prison, I'm trying to free you from your condition 
 I got a suspicion you bitches are wishing me gone 
 I'm hitting the chron, a kiss on the cheek and it's gone 
 Verse 3 - Vinnie Paz: 
 I'm a Freemason, I'm a Rosicrucian, I'm a Shriner 
 Moorish Science Temple of America's Osama 
 Amun Nebu Re Akh Ta Al Mateen is the father 
 United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors rhymer 
 It's wild hard tryna stay on my deen 
 I'm a bomb, I'm aram son of Shem and Fateem 
 Kill Devil Kill Devil Hill metal regime 
 I'm a rebel still, me and Bill devilish team 
 I'm a force to be reckoned with, I'm the deer hunter 
 The dirtbag to the underage beer runner 
 I like cold and snow, never revere summer 
 If God is a woman then I never hear from her 
 I'll chop a tree with my hands, it appears lumber 
 I'm the definition of lightning, you fear thunder 
 I'm taking everything motherfucker so fear hunger 
 You have a soft heartbeat fucking queer drummer
