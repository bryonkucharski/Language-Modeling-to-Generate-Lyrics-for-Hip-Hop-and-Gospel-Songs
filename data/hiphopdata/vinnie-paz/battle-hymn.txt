(Verse 1: Apathy) 
 I travel underground like the Goonies with a bag full of uzis 
 Emerging in a corner store where Arabs sell loosies 
 My banger's on the waist, I never wave it around 
 But I always chamber a round when there's strangers around 
 Set my phaser to kill, my force field is on max 
 Never relax, study the facts and stockpile gats 
 Cause the sky's about to bleed blood out from the clouds 
 This gas mask's in my backpack when walking through crowds 
 The post-apocalyptic, optic fitted with bionic circuitry 
 Surgically planted perfectly, no way to word it verbally 
 But extrasensory perception got me detecting 
 Any cop or detective, intercept them, and stop 'em with weapons 
 (Verse 2: King Syze) 
 King Syze, Vinnie Paz, we like Animal Hawk 
 Grammatical master for art, Heavy Metal we smashing your thoughts 
 We upper level, you rappers are technicians 
 Undergraduates I gotta doctorate when it comes to ripping 
 Scientific, I was spawned from a different species 
 And if you beat me, you gon' fight me every time you see me 
 It's never over, fuck Syze it's King Cobra 
 I'm brushing off my shoulders, spittin' lethal plus we taking over 
 I'm getting older so I live by the new slogan 
 That Philly shit the barrel smoke will leave your head open 
 IIt's open season on any rapper who want to beef with 
 The Army of the Pharaohs, yeah man we'll bring the seasoning 
 (Verse 3: Crypt the Warchild) 
 Don't hit me with the drama, don't approach me 'bout no B.I 
 'Cause I'm a Pharaoh king, and y'all ain't worthy of a reply 
 Bodies I've caught decomposing on the seaside 
 Catch me river dancing through the bloody waters, knee-high 
 Mind state is cutthroat, can't walk around deprived 
 My team shut it down, any access will be denied 
 Crown royal status Puerto-Ricans, that's how we ride 
 Nocturnal souls mesmerized by the streetlights 
 One shot at glory, game will never give you three tries 
 For the haters I've murked, they would love to see me die 
 Acid tripping vision, everything look hi-defy 
 Drugs, money, liquor, only things that get me by 
 (Verse 4: Jus Allah) 
 I got a lot of hate, I got to learn to love, stop the date 
 But some days I would rather murder than populate 
 Either way, I gotta open up the cosmic gates 
 Who knows what the future holds, gotta watch and wait 
 I can't function clear, keep a ton of guns and beer 
 I never sweat it, I get arrested like once a year 
 My gun big as two guns, you should cover your ears 
 Believe half of what you see and nothing you hear 
 Nobody listens, I got a lot of ground to cover 
 Bullets go in one ear and out the other 
 Tucked the weapon in, kick his face 
 In the blood pool like give him a taste of his own medicine 
 (Verse 5: Esoteric) 
 Impeach the president, I'm pulling out my ray-gun 
 Chuck D's greatest line and y'all ain't even thank him 
 Y'all ain't on my radar, horrible like Hagar 
 Mos Eisleys flow, beats banging on the space bar 
 Haters get mad, start banging on the spacebar 
 Flip over the desk, ought to take it up with HR 
 Your bitch give Bad Brains, like she work for H.R 
 I be where the rays are, you wonder where the weights are 
 I'm a cannibal, you cats wonder where the plates are 
 I know that I'm immortal why you wonder where the gates are 
 I Cold Crush your Brother like Grandmaster Caz 
 Paz work with the .45 like Lakim Shabazz 
 (Verse 6: Blacastan) 
 I'm from the East Coast nigga, but I'm still loc'ed out 
 I grew up inside the crack-house, my moms was smoked out 
 You know the kid with the bummy kicks, holes in his jeans 
 Same shirt, chilling on some bummy shit 
 Yeah, that was me though, attracted to the metal like Magneto 
 Sneakers started talking like ay bandito 
 Got my own never borrowed or begged for shit 
 Now it's on 'cause I'm rolling with the Pharaohs legit 
 Tired of rappers always rhyming that bullshit 
 Catch at you at your CD signing, with a full clip 
 Now, how you feel about the Pharaohs and the Demigodz? 
 That's what I thought nigga, because we large and in charge 
 (Verse 7: Celph Titled) 
 Keep shooters on stash, move and they blast 
 Refugees that came on an inner tube with a gat 
 Rubix Cuban code name, but you will respect the handle 
 Spend checks on Windex so I shine the chrome enamel 
 I throw hands with the devil so ain't much to fear after 
 Bitches cry over me, I'm a top tier rapper 
 American Idol with a wet wipe for you Desperate Housewives 
 Firecracker go off from my brick, the whole house white 
 And I will outright say that you soft 
 I write your favorite writer that you base your style off of 
 I'll let the Tec blast in ya, if the check cash finish 
 Shells give you a turtle-face, make ya back splinter 
 (Verse 8: Planetary) 
 With the semi-automatic, sipping henny in the attic 
 Spitting heavy with the god of the Serengeti blasted 
 Fasted, till I downloaded the attachment 
 The hunger came back, and I'm eating like a savage 
 Walking through the labyrinth, imagining it's Nazareth 
 Throwing more stones at the throne, lone catalyst 
 Puff puff pass it, that ain't ever been me 
 Only had the urge to annihilate the emcee 
 Used to ride the ten-speed, and copped the top ten sneaks 
 Never thought I'd be in Budapest counting ten Gs 
 But it all makes sense to me 
 Pharaoh clique sick man we thick more than ten feet 
 (Verse 9: Vinnie Paz) 
 If I ain't heard of y'all rappers then you gotta be soft 
 That's the reason why I talk about the bodies I caught 
 Bodies in north, New Haven down to New York 
 If it's a fight they put in front of me, it's gotta be fought 
 They got me in court for carrying the burner on the waist 
 My lawyer is an animal, he murdering the case 
 Boombox hardbody murdering the tape 
 I'll take your fucking heart like a burglar on a date 
 I'm magic with the four-fifth, perfect with the eight 
 I lavish with the lyricals, superlatives is great 
 Mash a motherfucker out, tourniquet his face 
 Jheri-head rappers ain't assertive as the great, yeah
