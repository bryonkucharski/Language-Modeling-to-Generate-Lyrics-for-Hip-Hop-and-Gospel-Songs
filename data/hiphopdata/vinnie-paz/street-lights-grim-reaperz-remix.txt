Verse 1 - Jus Allah: 
 I have the killing gene, I have machine guns and guillotines 
 I'm the gorilla of Philistines, I'm living the killer's dream 
 I just let the victim kick and scream 
 Get the blood and smithereens out with Mr. Clean 
 Separate your figurine into different dumpsters 
 I'm getting hungrier and I ain't getting any younger 
 Niggas should've killed me, now the wait's longer 
 And the A-capability made me stronger 
 I'mma die in service, I serve a higher purpose 
 I ain't nervous of what surfaces from wire searches 
 Mom sits inside a church reciting Bible verses 
 I'm entitled to idol my homicidal urges 
 I don't prefer help, getting to the death quotients 
 It works by itself set in perpetual motion 
 But I remove it, there's some probability to use it 
 'Cause I might lose it, present company included 
 The street light is the only light to ever shine 
 Kill devils with metal from the Beretta nine 
 If I shine I shine heavy metal grind 
 Must be out your fucking mind, never question mine 
 The street light is the only light that ever shine 
 Kill devils with metal from the Beretta nine 
 If I shine I shine heavy metal grind 
 Must be out your fucking mind to ever question mine 
 Verse 2 - Vinnie Paz: 
 You should never upset the man, the bullets the size of Pepsi cans 
 I am jolly while y'all are doing the best you can 
 Me and Jus Allah lion and the rest are lambs 
 I am possibly atrocity in West Sudan 
 I'm humanism, I'm through the prism of western man 
 I'm pugilism, I'm voodooism, I bless the sand 
 My hands are made of titanium, I could wreck a van 
 Lazarus, I am from Damascus and I am Sham 
 I ain't letting go until the clip is done 
 Y'all offbeat, every word I speak hit the drum 
 The most beautiful thing to me is a glistening gun 
 I find y'all is entertainment while I'm sipping rum 
 And if I ever fall on hard luck 
 I'll put some white on the street like a salt truck 
 'Cause I ain't trying to be hungry again 
 With these lowlife motherfucking dummies again, never again god 
 The street light is the only light to ever shine 
 Kill devils with metal from the Beretta nine 
 If I shine I shine heavy metal grind 
 Must be out your fucking mind, never question mine 
 The street light is the only light that ever shine 
 Kill devils with metal from the Beretta nine 
 If I shine I shine heavy metal grind 
 Must be out your fucking mind to ever question mine
