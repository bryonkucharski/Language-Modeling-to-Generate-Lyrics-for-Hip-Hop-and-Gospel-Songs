Ayo Paz, yo Blac 
 I rep Official Pistol Gang all mothafuckin' day 
 Hahahahhaha 
 Verse 1 - Vinnie Paz: 
 I pack it fast, no safety on the ratchet 
 Gats play chess like crazy with the gabbit 
 Bus ride mothafucka stayin' on the transit 
 Drugs like babies, real gracefully I handle it 
 I don't think Lance could understand it 
 Boxcutter Pazi from the faces that I damage 
 I put your fuckin' brains in the Atlantic 
 To fuse y'all fuckas with your cainery and panic 
 You talk about hammers, and I'll talk 'bout mine 
 When I'm fuckin' with the scramblers, I'm on cloud nine 
 Yeah, you disrespectful then it stomp out time 
 ?Bonti bwont? covered in a fuckin' chalk out line 
 I'm the name that pop up when you talk 'bout grime 
 I'm the name that pop up when you talk 'bout shine 
 And the big black heavy metal four-five mine 
 I'm a G cocksucker, never cross that line, yeah 
 Rap game gone, flatline 
 It's all over, today is the day we gonna 'em 
 Flat, frame, fall, flatline 
 We got an army, we loaded ready to hit 'em 
 Verse 2 - Zilla: 
 (Check it) Yo call me Zilla, I'm a monster with clap and kicks 
 The reason alone, you niggas pushin' albums back 
 You got a squad, but I doubt you crack 
 Every release that you ever drop could be bundled in the value pack 
 Political rap, my man's caught a bullet in Nam 
 Sitting twisted in the buggie with a seed in his arm 
 What's the motive when the reason is harm 
 We in the ghetto everyday fightin' demons with a badge and batawn 
 I got six million ways to pop, hustle to get it 
 When the odds stack higher than knots, struggle to live it 
 You ain't never felt the burn from lead 
 So I'm never catchin' the L, I just focus how to earn my bread 
 You down with OPG, I'm down with Paz and Blac 
 You down with dope emcees, my title proves that fact 
 Ain't a city that could pull my slack 
 The red beam is an invitation to hell, once I pull that back 
 "In America, ah people are uh, treated very much and uh, the police are there to contain us, um to brutalize and murder us." 
 Verse 3 - Blacastan: 
 And now's over with the livest rhyme killaz 
 Knowledge unfoldin', is the rise from the sacred five pillars 
 Conquest the conquer, pillage your village 
 Respect god, play hard, even in a live scrimmage 
 Face squads that call, we tarnish their image 
 Viking style, celebrate with barrels of Guinness 
 And shoot outs, we replenish when the clicks is finished 
 Gettin' head on the couch, watchin' Venus play tennis 
 I hold a mic like Jeter hold tennants 
 It's tragic like Troy Davis in his ?? 
 From the ending to beginning, figure eight stay spinnin' 
 I'm infinite, you can't bust off nigga you impentant 
 Sound waves travel underwater like sonar 
 I'm stealth, I can't be detected by radar 
 Probably in a fly car, with the seats reclined 
 It's Vinnie, Zilla and Blac nigga, flatline
