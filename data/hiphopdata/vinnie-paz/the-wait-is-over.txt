 Uh, fuck wit ma brotha Doap and I'ma cut his throat 
 We definition representin' what is Doap? 
 What is hope when ya faith get tested? 
 Yeah, what is coke when da weight ain't stretchin'? 
 Yeah, what is hate when da hatin' ain't affectin'? 
 A buncha mad niggas we comin' for mad figgaz 
 That upset money, that coke and wet money 
 That Frank Lucas buried under da steps money 
 This official like a breath wit a whistle 
 I'm from where young bulls can't read but day rep wit day pistols 
 Yeah, respect is a issue but neva wit mines 
 Y'all funkies get away da shit but neva wit crimes 
 Stick not like a pregnant john 
 I'm finna wreck this john (show 'em) 
 Flatten ya face use it to eat my breakfast on 
 Your lyrics is wack dey disrespect da song

 Verse 2 - Doap Nixon: 
 Yeah, I'm on their heels Reef, yo, let's go 
 Yo, y'all niggas is average learnin' to crawl 
 Producers is mad ass, we don't return ya calls 
 Ya emails get deleted so beat it 
 Ya helps is not needed, Knowledge itself completes it 
 Divine cipher power slit in this game nice 
 Signed a deal burnt my advance on da same night 
 (Let's go) This game so foul, so many cats 
 So many petty labels, so many traps 
 Ya moms shoulda put you in a school to clean clothes 
 Dudes ova here hit gold wit mean flows 
 I'm in a ill Reef stay on da road 
 Da Pharaohs doing shows, I got that yay on da stove 
 My whole life felt like I'm stuck at a stoplight 
 But seein' how da hustlaz got that money to wash right 
 Me and Reef came from da nights we slang white 
 To spittin' out Bangkok rippin' da same mic 
 (Hook) Samples scratching 2x 
 Verse 3 - Vinnie Paz: 
 Yeah, ain't nobody fuckin' wit da .38 on my waist 
 And when that bulldog bark it'll lay you to waste 
 I ain't fuckin' around wit ya, y'all need to stay in ya place 
 And da vest ain't gonna help you God I aim at da face 
 Y'all ain't doin' shit original fam 
 And my gun is da same color as The Original Man 
 I caught a body and I put da shit to digital cam 
 That shit you makin' ain't a hit it's just a pitiful jam 
 Yeah, ayo Doap cuzin' hit 'em wit da .40 glock 
 Make his body levitate and he can do a dome wit 'Pac 
 Y'all mothafuckaz should just take this as a warnin' shot 
 I'm bout to celebrate, I heard about da fallin' cop 
 Y'all think y'all could fuck wit Paz and it's not hardly 
 I put your name in da obituary - John Tardy 
 My whole cipha should be dreaded like we Bob Marley 
 And it ain't anotha human that's Master Farad Godly
