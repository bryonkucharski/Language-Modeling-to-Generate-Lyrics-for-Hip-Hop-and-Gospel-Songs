Verse 1 - Vinnie Paz: 
 I wet the whole entire block then I broke off 
 Lift the boat off, Russian sickle Nikolai Volkoff 
 I ain't never met a motherfucker that was so soft 
 I remain fire like folk who ain't turn their stove off 
 And I still rhyme cousin with a flawless fervor 
 I got money and catch cases like Roethlisberger 
 And y'all are Dennis Dixon, that's just something different 
 I need another prescription, I got a pen addiction 
 I got a Muslim shorty now but the ex was Christian 
 She ain't overstand the godliness of my position 
 Anybody who ain't family is opposition 
 The M9 got a big nose, Scottie Pippen 
 Vinnie sipping on the Goose, god hit this marley 
 My hands running out of fingers, young Vince Lombardi 
 I got a tet offensive similar to Victor Charlie 
 I meet a bitch, I don't sweat it, this ain't a Christmas party 
 Try to stop minds from growing 
 I'll make your blood stop flowing 
 Fuck your life
