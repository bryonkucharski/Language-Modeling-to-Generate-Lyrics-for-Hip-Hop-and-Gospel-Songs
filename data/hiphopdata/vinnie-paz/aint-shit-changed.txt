Ain't a goddamn thing gonna change, I'm still the same Vinnie* 
 I'm still the same fat motherfucker, same guinea 
 A little bit more money, that's why I ain't skinny 
 Still the same block-hugger, still the same city 
 I still got the same people that remain with me 
 That was drinking 40s with me when they slain Biggie 
 And the same motherfuckers felt the pain with me 
 When my stepfather died and they came with me 
 I ain't expect nothing less from them, they chained to me 
 Spiritually, mentally, we the same really 
 We all was raised on different blocks in the same Philly 
 Still some stupid motherfuckers saying they can't feel me 
 Actually they do feel me, they just ashamed really 
 That they ain't shining like the kid, a bunch of lames really 
 Dirtbags trying to make the kid insane really 
 But Louie Dogs just impervious to pain really 
 Every morning I rise up, I open my eyes 
 Thinking I'm the shit 
 I guarantee if you're fucking with me 
 You gon' know who you're fucking with 
 I been this way since I came of age 
 And I never did play them games 
 I'll be this way till the day I lay 
 Cause ain't a goddamn thing gonna change 
 It ain't anybody ever gonna hold me down 
 I'm one of the greatest ever homie I stole the crown 
 I'm too strong and fast, you ain't slowing me down 
 I'm gonna keep beating your head, call me Homie the Clown 
 I hope that y'all are holding close to your rosaries now 
 I think I got a couple snitches that's close to me now 
 If I was them I'd keep it moving be ghost from me now 
 And pray that they don't run into Vinnie socially now 
 It's always one motherfucker trying to set you up 
 Dry snitch take something from you, wet you up 
 I was sleeping being dumb trying to protect the fuck 
 He getting buck fifty, slice him from his neck to gut 
 All in all ain't nothing changed, still the same squad 
 Some are still hustling, summers at the same job 
 Some is 9 to 5, some is on the graveyard 
 I'd rather have them on tour with me so I pray hard 
 I'm the truth motherfucker, not built to betray 
 With the philosophy that Rome wasn't built in a day 
 No matter how strong the body it wilts and decay 
 After it's hit by a shotty that's silver and grey 
 I'm a mess, bipolar, I'm willing to say 
 That there ain't a woman that's living that's willing to stay 
 Somebody please fix my head, I'm willing to pay 
 I'm too at ease with the dead and the killing okay 
 Damn, I'm anti-social I'd rather be home 
 And when I'm drunk Planet and Crypt carry me home 
 I don't have a happy ending, just tragedy homes 
 You better address me as mister or majesty homes 
 I'm a messiah, I'm a liar, I have to be stoned 
 I'm a pariah, I retire, I have to be cloned 
 I have fire, I'm desire, this has to be known 
 I'm a survivor, a relier on tragedy's throne
