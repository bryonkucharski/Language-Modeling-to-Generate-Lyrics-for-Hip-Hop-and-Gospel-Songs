Diabolic 
 Ah ha ha ha... 
 Diabolic / Vinnie Paz 
 Foul Play bitch! 
 Verse 1 - Diabolic: 
 I got Pope John Paul in his casket turnin', 
 When I'm at a catholic sermon, smashed with a flask of bourbon, 
 Dashing in a black suburban, passing, swervin', 
 Crash 'n' burnin', like attacks from Iraq insurgents, 
 But now I'm back determined to have some virgins, 
 Taking face shots like Botox, I'm a plastic surgeon, 
 Not your average person, 'cause this cash I'm earnin', 
 Got me riding dirty like the mastered version of my tracks with cursing, 
 The illest cat for certain, too perverted to mention, 
 In a class by myself like internal suspension, 
 I'm terminal spreadin' through you're chest and ribs, 
 Till the song's stuck in ya' head and gives you less than a month left to live, 
 Infect the kids, I love to poison minds, 
 Got hoes bending over backwards like double jointed spines, 
 I'm at the point in time where I don't give a flying fuck, 
 And if I get fired up you get you're jaw wired shut, 
 And it's... 
 Hook - Diabolic: 
 Mic check, one, two, we back on the block again, 
 Body in the trunk, somebody's gettin' shot again, 
 Fist full of haze, stomach full of Heineken, 
 My bitch put the radio on, "No not again!" 
 We want that real shit, somethin' I can feel shit, 
 You know the gutter shit, fuck all that other shit, 
 That go to war shit, kickin' in the door shit, 
 Diabolic, Vinnie Paz; yeah that raw shit. 
 Verse 2 - Vinnie Paz: 
 Ayo D, you the foulest muthafucka around, 
 Anyone who got a beef with us get stuck with the pound, 
 That's regardless if they hate us or fuck with the sound, 
 And regardless if they're ravers or they come from up-town, 
 I don't care who get stuck, black, white, Spanish, anybody, 
 My weaponry a left buck and a mini shottie, 
 I don't discriminate, Pazienza blazin' people, 
 I kill you're dog and eat him up like I was Asian people, 
 Me and Diabolic similar to haze and diesel, 
 It's straight to the head and stick inside the veins of people, 
 And Pazienza too intelligent, my brain'll eat you, 
 My bitch stay strapped, even Vinnie's dame is lethal, 
 I did a little bid for taking fuckin' change from people, 
 But Diabolic did the muthafuckin same, we equal, 
 That's why people call the two of us insanely evil, 
 And that's why people call the two of us insanely evil. 
 Verse 3 - Vinnie Paz: 
 I scream "Allahu Akbar, murder murder, kill kill" 
 In the same sentence that's why I'm incredibly ill, 
 We better rebuild, and put the muthafuckin pope in prison, (hahahaa) 
 For practicing remote control socialism, 
 But I ain't mean to get political on this shit, 
 So give me a forty-ouncer, pass the muthafuckin' buscuit 
 And do some type of shit I did that I don't wan' re-visit, 
 You better tell the c-cypha that they gone need ballistics. 
 Verse 4 - Diabolic: 
 So keep you distance, 'cause me and Vinnie, we the sickest, 
 We'll make you sleep with fishes like tsunamis from the East Pacific, 
 I keep a spliff lit, guzzling this Belvedere, 
 Chase it with a twelve of beer, and heaven fell, hell is here, 
 Hell yeah I smell you're fear, and I'm you're fearless leader, 
 With lyrics deeper than the crater left in Hiroshima, 
 So if you love hip-hop but saw the spirit leave ya, 
 Me and Vinnie thought we'd bring it back here to see'ya!
