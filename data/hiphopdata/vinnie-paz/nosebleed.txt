(Verse 1: RA The Rugged Man) 
 Ruin your idol, I'm glued to the Bible and my rifle, losing your title 
 Instead of shooting you're suing for libel 
 Everybody hate me 'cause I stay true to the facts 
 The Ku Klux Klan hate me more than Jews and Blacks 
 Yeah, you over for certain, you can pray to whoever 
 Jehovah, Buddha, Allah, Jesus, Mother Mary the Virgin 
 Is it the violence that the TV taught us? 
 I grew up worshipping Charles Bronson, John Rambo, and Chuck Norris 
 Pazienza the Pazmanian Damien rapping the pain he in 
 Cracking your cranium, I'm macking mahogany at the Palladium 
 I'm Bruce Leroy, you Eddie Arkadian 
 I got the gat and the black ? Arabian I'm waterboarding like Dick Cheney 
 And yo back at the first day of my birth 
 The moment I was born I was condemned by the Catholic Church 
 Warsaw battling the streets we inhabited 
 I'm sugar like Ray Robinson, you ain't even saccharin 
 Leaving you staggering making an impact 
 New York, we created this rap 
 This a blatant attack, East Coast we taking it back, c'mon 
 Life is love, death, pain 
 Hate nothing ain't left ain't nothing to gain 
 Life is love, death, pain 
 Hate nothing ain't left ain't nothing to gain 
 (Verse 2: Vinnie Paz) 
 I'm letting this motherfuckers live, it was truly compassion 
 I'm brutally bashing 'cause I'm steadily losing my passion 
 Tell Louie to stab 'em or to shoot 'em with two different Magnums 
 I'm usually packing carry hawks like I'm Julian Jackson 
 I'll rob 'em for Gucci, I'm a thief, these are Lucifer's actions 
 I'm a provider, I'm a messiah, Jesus' assassin 
 I don't think it's anybody living truly could match this 
 I slaughter Buddha through the computer, Medusa's companion 
 A lot of rappers wanna beef with the lion 
 Ain't too many people that's as fucking lethal as I am 
 I feast 'em and fry em, Vinnie so at peace with the violence 
 I exercise absolute power, peace to the tyrants 
 I'm old school like quarter waters and eating in silence 
 You new school like faggot rappers competing for prizes 
 I'mma send you to the afterlife speak to Osiris 
 And when he ask you why you there tell him the lethalest virus
