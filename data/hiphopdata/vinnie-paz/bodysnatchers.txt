Verse 1 - Vinnie Paz: 
 A rebel that yell, take you through the levels of Hell 
 Take your commissary pussy like it settled in jail 
 I'm a heavyweight, Vinnie don't need to get on a scale 
 A man of God but usually the Devil prevails 
 I don't work, all y'all motherfuckers work for me 
 I love death, you motherfuckers get murked for free 
 I don't follow trends, I just do what work for me 
 I don't live on Earth, the motherfucking Earth in me 
 Louie Dogs don't relate to y'all 'cause I'm a godly creature 
 I chop a motherfucking brick like a karate teacher 
 I wouldn't call what you doing sick, you just got a fever 
 I have my mother's heart and I have my father's features 
 You know I got the hammer in the jeans 
 And more white shit than in the can at a latrine 
 I go bananas for the cream 
 I don't have a moral fibre, Vinnie take your nana for her cream yeah 
 Verse 2 - Demoz: 
 Niggas rapping but they comical, it's logical 
 They overrated hating so I cut them like a dominos 
 Box of pizza fuck the perpetrating hospital 
 When nurses race in, running niggas over in a hearse with Satan 
 Squash a nigga and his baby chorus 
 His more collaboration with commercial rap and if you pay me for it 
 So fuck a ? I'm the hardest, I'll walk in Philly with a philly 
 Selling niggas CDs yelling garbage 
 Pardon me, that's just my sense of humour 
 Look I'm intense, I'm making sense 
 You niggas sense try and spread your rumours 
 Basically I'm trying to make it happen 
 Scheming I can make it rapping 
 Stay away from niggas who relate to acting 
 It's nothing personal, I take your money 
 Spend it on your bitch, call you a bitch 
 And tell you pussy try and take it from me 
 It's funny how a motherfucking bitch change 
 Bitch get changed, it's nothing if she sniff 'caine 
 And turn crazy, sell her own soul, her own baby 
 All over this gravy, it's all over it's shady 
 How the world turns and it's all over this money 
 It's funny, next thing you know you all over your money 
 With your face out, brains bleeding, your dame leaving with the next man 
 Plan A to the bling scheming on your life savings 
 Like praying they might saving 'em from his life wasting 
 All over his wife patience, I don't like hatred 
 But if you can do it to me I'mma do it to you 
 Give a fuck if you beautiful what your booty can do 
 Your pussy's tight, titties big, bitch whoopty-dee-doo 
 I got a bundle on your head to kill you and your crew 
 Got so much they don't like you 
 Mind you bullets fly through your head, they gonna find you 
 Blind you with red beams, bury you cockroaches 
 Chicks can get it too so baby do not approach us 
 I'm a sick being, stick me in a rap cipher 
 I'm a light lighter hairspray 'em and burn biters
