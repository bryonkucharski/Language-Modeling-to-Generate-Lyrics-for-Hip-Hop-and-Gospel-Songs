"There's no time. NO!" 
 Verse 1 - Vinnie Paz: 
 I start the war with the Villaparosa 
 I drank a cup of virgin blood and it spill on your sofa 
 I don't stop till the mothafuckin' killin' is over 
 They say that Pazienza godly, I build with Jehovah 
 You gettin' cut god, nice with the knife 
 And head cracked don't mean that I'm nice with the dice 
 The razor blade is still rusty but liable to slice 
 But Vinnie keep in underground like the rival of Christ 
 I'm a big mothafucker but the ox is fast 
 Morekee, Jason Vorhees, hockey mask 
 I'm in love with my 4/5th cock and blast 
 I'm in love with the quarts and fifths always smashed 
 Vinnie Paz and Big Lou on the proper path 
 Triple OG burglary with stockin' mask 
 Vinnie Paz and Big Lou on the proper path 
 Triple OG burglary with stockin' mask 
 Verse 2 - Big Lou: 
 Me I out model these niggas don't know we go Congo 
 Run up in they crib, bang 'em like some bongos 
 Since they wanna ball like they Rajon Rondo 
 Paz pistol whip that ass, three piece combo 
 I'm the bastard son of Ali Hondo 
 So I gotta son niggas, disrespect throw you off the Baratono 
 Or the Ben Franklyn Bridge, in front of your wife and kids 
 And then ask them if they want to move to my crib 
 I'm a legitimate, spit in your face ignorant 
 Mafia type syndicate with no birth certificate 
 Pushed a lot of ki's, but never played instruments 
 Got a lot of arms, I ain't talkin' 'bout ligaments 
 Got a lot of seeds, so my blood infinite 
 Hard to be impetant when bitches stay interested 
 Get rich or die tryin', that mean I'm gettin' it 
 Niggas like me and Vinnie Paz, livin' it 
 Yo Big Lou. 
 What up my Nigga? 
 What's the word bana? 
 (Spanish) 
 Yeah. 
 Nothin' but fire nigga
