Life, this role of life 
 This is Rock of Gibraltar rap 
 The Springfield M14 show you where the coffin's at 
 You motherfuckers don't belong in rap 
 Fuck with me you got a better chance taking an abortion back 
 You lack flavour, put some sauce on that 
 I went to the Great Wall, put my fist through and walked through that 
 Where this motherfucker's fortune at? 
 I'mma levitate his body, make it spin like a Laundromat 
 Motherfucker I was born to rap 
 I've been making records wild long, never did a song that's whack 
 How many have accomplished that? 
 I was wild as a young boy, shouldn't have put moms through that 
 Vinnie Paz been to Nam and back 
 I ain't never put the guns down cousin so my palms is black 
 You a bitch, I ain't involved with that 
 I got a big trunk and that's where Vinnie keep all of his corpses at 
 Life, this role of life 
 Silverback Gorilla walk through the minefield 
 We don't see eye to eye how you define real 
 Y'all are wondering if I'm out of my mind still 
 I just need some liquor and pills and I'm chill 
 I run with Puerto Rocks, Morenos and vagabonds 
 And Paz will shoot this motherfucker up like Barrie Bonds 
 I'm like a military doctor, Vinnie carry arms 
 My shit is military proper, Vinnie carry bombs 
 I kick in the door like BI did 
 And the automatic weapons look like TI crib 
 Vinnie fat, you'll never see my ribs 
 I don't call it loading bullets, I refer to it as feed my kids 
 All I think about is slaughtering y'all 
 This little motherfucker named Charles Hamilton is harder than y'all 
 It's in the garbage with y'all 
 Listen to all you Myspace rappers, I'm a father to y'all 
 I write in the rain, turn beautiful night into pain 
 I turn life into a frightening game 
 I don't have love in me, it's just ice in my veins 
 My fist Hammer of Thor, I Tyson the game 
 This rap shit deep in my heart 
 Y'all was sleep from the start 
 But that just led to unbelievable art 
 And on top of that the god is unbelievably smart 
 My bare fists turn trees into bark 
 Y'all don't want any improvement at all 
 Y'all are devils, y'all are torturing the rule of law 
 My mind is a computer of war 
 And it's typically the biggest motherfucker that'll usually fall 
 Give me one take cousin, the god out 
 A forty of ? and I ride out 
 The forty Glock popping your eyes out 
 Now you never get a chance to see what the god 'bout
