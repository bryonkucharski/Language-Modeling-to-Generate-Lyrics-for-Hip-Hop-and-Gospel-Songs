An innocent man becomes a target of insanity as he steps into the crosshairs of a homicidal maniac with a need for revenge. Join us for a journey into the dark endless cabins of a sick and twisted man. Join us for a journey into living hell. 
 (Verse 1 - Doap Nixon) 
 I feel lightning in my fingertips 
 Swiff status, I give a nigga his wings bitch 
 Sleep on me, creep on me 
 Throw heat on me and I'm still gonna eat homie 
 Ill Bill from La Coka Nostra 
 Come sideways and we'll both ? ya 
 Reef got the toaster, all I gotta do is whistle 
 And my bitches will smoke ya 
 What more can an underground rapper say? 
 How longer is these rappers gonna shine gay? 
 First up is Ye (Kanye), second and third is Ye and my shit get no play 
 Where I'm from yo the jakes'll murk ya 
 Act like you know and the fiends'll jerk ya 
 Three classics under my belt 
 I just lost my comrade, I need something to melt 
 (Verse 2 - Reef The Lost Cauze) 
 You think you BIG or Tupac, you Nosferatu 
 ? Ferragamos, murder, death, kill, ammo 
 There's no tomorrow, you won't see the evening news 
 Rolling ? goose spend your time like Beetlejuice 
 We the truth, you talking about the cat you hit 
 Vicious as the blackened spears and sleep for half a year 
 You only bust your gat in air 
 Yeah you killing the clouds, having shootouts with the atmosphere 
 You the wackest here, unable for my rap to fear 
 You live fairy tales like glass slippers and magic mirrors 
 Who's the fairest? Speak the language of Arabs 
 Sharif terror, send 'em to the sky like a chair lift 
 I'm original, never jocking y'all style 
 I steel a nigga, watch him slide like crocodile mile 
 I'm the wild child style vile since wild style 
 My guns go boom boom, your guns go pow pow 
 Deadly sins, we ain't gonna pray for em 
 Ill Bill and Reef, I'mma spray for em 
 Five niggas that's the best in the game 
 If the niggas ain't fam then they feeling the flame 
 Deadly sins, we ain't gonna pray for em 
 King Mag and Paz, I'mma spray for em 
 Five niggas that's the best in the game 
 If the niggas ain't fam then they feeling the flame 
 (Verse 3 - King Magnetic) 
 It's the heavy metal king, ain't talking about the group though 
 'Cause I'll beat a gun charge right through the loop hole 
 Still down to shoot though, use 'em accordingly 
 They supported me, protected what my music afforded me 
 Disorderly, hold your beef, do them shits grimy 
 Literally down with Doap since the mid-90s 
 That's right, face cringe from the syringe binge 
 And friends bend every rule that you made within 
 Aim and spray again, nothing like a window cleaner 
 Talk politics up close and no leader 
 And for the front of your eyes is binoculars 
 You need to stop in the apocalypse to rock with us 
 If not it's AZ about to rock it up 
 Doing open heart surgery on your esophagus 
 I'mma die profitless like cult leaders 
 Aim assault heaters at adult, leaders gonna bolt 
 (Verse 4 - Ill Bill) 
 The game of thrones, stick you for your chains and clothes 
 Most rappers will suck dick for cocaine and dro 
 Ratchets explode, homie my chrome'll rape your soul 
 Bring twelve plagues like Moses raining toads 
 Fuck your tongue wanted the blood 
 Hit you in the head with an audible guns 
 Unfortunate ones get tortured and hung 
 The cult leader homie with the sorcerer's tongue 
 Heavy Metal King influence your daughters and sons 
 You the topic of the song Shook Ones from Mobb Deep 
 I'm harder than bricks or football on concrete 
 Chilling in deadstock Jordans, millions of dead cops 
 Warnings, COs, informants 
 A hip hop Blackie Lawless, see more bodies than coroners 
 Unfamiliar aura, peel off shotties at foreigners 
 Grinning with pride, gorillas with militant minds 
 You win or you die, I'll empty the clip in your eye 
 Deadly sins, we ain't gonna pray for em 
 Ill Bill and Reef, I'mma spray for em 
 Five niggas that's the best in the game 
 If the niggas ain't fam then they feeling the flame 
 Deadly sins, we ain't gonna pray for em 
 King Mag and Paz, I'mma spray for em 
 Five niggas that's the best in the game 
 If the niggas ain't fam then they feeling the flame 
 (Verse 5 - Vinnie Paz) 
 There's no ode to the goat, throw his body in the moat 
 Bucky fifty to windpipe, go for the throat 
 Pussy boy rappers better hold rosary close 
 Ain't too many in my cypher that's closer than Doap 
 Throw the faggot in the water, I hope that he float 
 Hope they ready for the slaughter, it's awfully close 
 I think he wanna kill himself I offer him rope 
 My vision is blurry, I'm singing Allah through a scope 
 Boxcutter Paz John the Baptist 
 Ain't nobody safe when I bomb you bastards 
 Only thing I think about is Lam and gat clips 
 Jordans, Grey Goose, bitches, and caskets 
 I'm an ugly motherfucker, give me a fat bitch 
 A dime is too much work, Vinnie is savage 
 Rob a motherfucker, rip through his assets 
 The 28 V rip through your cabbage 
 Yeah,
