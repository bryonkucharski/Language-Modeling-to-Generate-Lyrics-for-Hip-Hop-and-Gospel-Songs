Yo, yo, we back, once again 
 This some new shit we came up with 
 This was actually me and my partner Scott Stallone 
 We produced this record together, produced by Vinnie Paz and Scott Stallone 
 This Death Messiah 2012 featuring Johnny Cash 
 We hooked this shit up 
 We felt like it needed to be rhymed on 
 Rebirth something that was a little you know, a few couple years old 
 Enjoy this shit man 
 Fall back, smoke an L to this
