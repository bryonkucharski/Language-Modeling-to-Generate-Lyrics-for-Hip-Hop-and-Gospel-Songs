 We minding my business and leave me yours alone 
 We talking about me your job is on the camera motherfucker 
 Hey look at this motherfucker right here in the back. Look. Look. Look at this motherfucker right here in the back 
 Look. Look at him uppercut. Look at the uppercut! Look at the uppercut! Look at the uppercut! 
 Look lo lo lo look at the uppercut right there! Hey! Hey, do the uppercut again! Do the uppercut again 
 "Is it good or bad?" 
 Terrible. Like the worst thing in the world 
 Hey it's a job, you know what I mean? And especially in America having a job is a blessing and doing something you love is a blessing even if the people are miscreants 
 Yeah you's a fucking wuss. You know what I mean? You couldn't last a day in my shoes 
 A lot of these cats I wish they'd just forget the address to the gym 
 You know everything is not for everybody. You don't see me going in motherfucking Wall Street picking up a fucking briefcase trying to type do you? Cause that's not what the fuck I do 
 I beat the fuck out of people. You know what I mean? 
 "Slow down and recollect" 
 (Tragedy Khadafi) 
 Flow is tsunami, bulletproof Bugatti 
 Arab Nazi spraying a semi out a Ferrari 
 Crash Maybach Music, smash Aston Martins 
 Cops turned rappers, y'all niggas is targets! 
 Regardless, I'm the hardest to wannabe martyrs 
 Chess game weak, niggas need to move more smarter 
 Art of war is mastered, my thoughts be the realest 
 Military intelligence, hood under surveillance 
 Armed up like they got beef with the government 
 Hood shit, ghetto apostle, live covenant 
 Move like the niggas that's facing Capital Punishment 
 Jedi, Militant Minds is who I run with 
 Queens where the villains meet, killas with illa heat 
 Lifers with blood in they eye, saying they feeling me 
 Naturally will only be me, one tragedy 
 Kuwait Majesty, stay tuned, witness the faculty 
 "You ain't ready yet" 
 "Slow down and recollect" 
 "You ain't ready yet" 
 "Slow down and recollect" 
 "Slow down and recollect" 
 "You ain't ready yet" 
 "Slow down and recollect" 
 "You ain't ready yet" 
 "Slow down and recollect" 
 "Slow down and recollect" 
 (Vinnie Paz) 
 Come on lord don't make me load the pump 
 The Mossberg have you taking shots like the local drunk 
 My trigger finger itch like I ain't had a smoke in months 
 I land a left-right-left before you throw a punch. (Left, right left!) 
 I was sent from God in case Jehovah fronts 
 I'm the explorer in the Torah I was chosen once 
 Put you in the corner you a lonely dunce 
 I been rhyming since Phyllis Hyman and golden fronts 
 And y'all don't wanna see the heat melt 
 The strap go click and I ain't talking 'bout a seat-belt 
 Y'all could never feel the pain that we felt 
 Pops died, watch my mother cry, think how she felt! 
 You in México, fuck around with Federale 
 I ain't hard to find, look for the severed bodies 
 I come from a culture where we treasure Gotti 
 Sono Italiano, guidare le Bugatti 
 "You ain't ready yet" 
 "Slow down and recollect" 
 "You ain't ready yet" 
 "Slow down and recollect" 
 "You ain't ready yet" 
 "Slow down and recollect" 
 "You ain't ready yet" 
 "Slow down and recollect" 
 "Slow down and recollect" 
 "Slow down and recollect" 
 "Slow down and recollect" 
 "Slow down and recollect"
