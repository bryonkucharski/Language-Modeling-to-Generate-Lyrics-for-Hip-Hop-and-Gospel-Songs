Turnaround, every now and then I get a little bit lonely 
 And you're never coming around 
 (Yeah, Yo, Huh... small real life man more real love) 
 Turnaround, Every now and then I get a little bit tired 
 Of listening to the sound of my tears 
 (That's all we got man, that's all we need yo straight maintainin) 
 Yo I must be the most valuable playa in this game of life 
 The way I claim my name is like yo but I'm just tryin' to maintain baby 
 These people think I'm flaws but for real yo my mind is lost 
 I could spill my heart out right now but yo would it be worth it cause 
 I got what I need so I'm giving back I'm not a taker 
 And no longer to soon 'cause we gettin' paper can y'all feel that? 
 Time flys fast but I got to feel my ground 
 Cause nothin' hurts you more than when your best friend is lettin you down 
 Finally I understand we're from heaven my dogs by my side 
 When my man got accepted by college I almost cried man 
 They never lie to me have pictures while I was on the side line 
 We all had the same dreams of watching each other shine 
 But it was the ones who knew me as I am when I just needed a hug 
 Thinkin' I would live in a better place if I just spread some more love 
 Space is not an obstacle I feel you closer when we're apart 
 My peoples forever in my heart stand by my side when it's getting lost 
 Turnaround, every now and then I get a 
 Little bit lonely and you're never coming around 
 Turnaround, Every now and then I get a 
 Little bit tired of listening to the sound of my tears 
 Ay yo I'm turnin' around every fuckin' step I take burns to ground 
 It ain't that hard to see that I'm the one whos hurtin' now 
 I'm to cursed to plow motha fuckas wanna see me underground 
 But when I'm walkin' on the path but I'm searchin for the crown 
 Bring it to heart this shits complicated ain't no nobody can get the picture 
 I ain't gettin' richer but motha fuckas be playa hatin' what's the deal? 
 4-8 soldier blessed with skills 
 The rest will fill this fucked up shit that stresses me when I need to kill a man 
 Paranoia with the break me break me shit is so crazy crazy 
 Gotta wake up gotta take some time to takes what's mine I'm first to make it 
 Everyday runs straight blaze me blazy 
 Please tell me lord get these feelings off my shoulders 
 I show you motha fuckas y'all can't hold us 
 Two of dogs behind bars I left the scars 
 Hopin that his soul would not be intoxicated but I'm sayin' that in some fuckin' laws 
 I gotta be strong I gotta move on 
 Losin my backs protected by laws not for share to see one 
 Note to my family and those who roll with me 
 Turnaround, every now and then I get a 
 Little bit lonely and you're never coming around 
 Turnaround, Every now and then I get a 
 Little bit tired of listening to the sound of my tears 
 Turnaround, Every now and then I get a 
 Little bit nervous that the best of all the years have gone by 
 I knew that it was love at first sight but too forbidden to be right 
 I saw it in her eyes she needed a man like me in her life 
 But first you try to hide it as your heart is beatin' 
 You had some thoughts of cheatin' but you resisted the temptation 
 The situation was this girl knew how to treat a man 
 Soft as sand so slim and so tan sincerely the most perfect body 
 Everyone told me to touch another man's girl is the biggest sin but I couldn't stop kissin' that soft skin 
 I had to wear this girls hand at the thought my heart would fall in love again 
 I was a playa in this game heart swellin up with pain 
 But that all changed I knew you were gone be my soon 
 Late night callin my cell phone when yo man was sleepin' in the other room 
 You don't deserve to cry I want to be the one to make you smile all the time 
 But I was too focused on gettin' mine 
 In the end we got lost faith played the biggest trick on us 
 It was him, me, and you left stuck with three hearts crushed 
 Turnaround, every now and then I get a 
 (Yeah, we came a long way man can't break this shit now) 
 Little bit lonely and you're never coming around 
 (L.E.O.P.A God bless the child with peaceful eyes)
