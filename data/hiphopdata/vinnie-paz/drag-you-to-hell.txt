I'm taking my own life, I might as well 
 Guess where I'm going cause the Devil's inside 
 I'm taking my own life, that's where I'm going 
 Except they might not sell weed in Hell 
 See I always have respect 'cause I always talk fact 
 The .38 and the 50 caliber hot, black 
 I always left with nothing but I always brought back 
 I always been a hustler, I probably go off that 
 Y'all don't wanna go to work with the boy 
 There's only two words that describe me: search and destroy 
 I don't think you wanna get murked by the boy 
 My shit is military, y'alls is like a nursery toy 
 It's hurting you boys 
 My team ain't even hungry, we famished 
 I murder everybody, fuck collateral damage 
 I'm animal savage with Hannibal's habits 
 I'll mangle your cabbage 
 I walked into the parish and I strangled the faggots 
 I hang with the baddest brothers, put their trust into Jesus 
 Run with brothers who's forty guzzlers, Islamic extremists 
 Ugly and ignorant is how they perceive us 
 I don't care, I'm trying to deal with my personal demons 
 Y'all don't wanna go that route 
 Broke motherfucker need to throw his throwback out 
 If you see me drinking something good I stole that stout 
 If you see me drinking in the hood then roll back out 
 On the real I don't want no one to bother me, cousin 
 Rapping just a little fucking bit of part of me, cousin 
 I'm just trying to have a drink at the bar with my cousin 
 I ain't mean to be rude, god, pardon me cousin 
 I stay strapped lord, gun in the tuck 
 Young boys act wild lord funny as fuck 
 I scrap southpaw sonning you fucks 
 Look at you lord on the floor bummy as fuck, what? 
 My life been defined by death 
 So I guess if everybody dead mine is next 
 My father dropped a jewel on me, time forgets 
 It's not as easily the mind forgets 
 Y'all know what I mean? 
 Drag you to Hell, I'm evil dead, you can call me Sam Raimi 
 These motherfuckers want a verse but they can't pay me 
 Fuck a funeral home, put 'em in the sand maybe 
 Y'all are acting like you're big, like you're mad gravy 
 Y'all don't wanna beef with the god 
 Don't have the brain power to compete with the god 
 Y'all should retreat from the god before you get turned to meat 
 Something to eat for the god, peace to the gods 
 I carry heavy shit, big guns, John Rambo 
 I'mma spot Russia like Pakistani commandos 
 How you go to war when you're standing in sandals? 
 Now you're dead and your family handling candles 
 Don't even call for a truce, I'm about to end this 
 Whole motherfucker when I call for the troops 
 Reservoir dog walk with the troops 
 And I burn this motherfucker down to the ground down to its roots
