(Agallah) 
 Ain't nothing fucking with Ag and Pistol Paz 
 'Bout to spaz with the bars like Alcatraz 
 Word to Sean, 'bout to kick a bone up out your ass 
 The rap shit could do better off without your ass 
 I'm not a rap fan, but I smoke the Afghan 
 Stand like the last man, cats need a CAT scan 
 Brain need a transplant, stupid fuck, hashtag 
 You the type to wash your face with an ass rag 
 Kill cockroach rappers like a black flag 
 What make Ag mad is bombs in Baghdad 
 Put your soul on ice too, Ras Kass 
 It ain't funny when Ag with the last laugh 
 You eat bath salts, I do salt baths 
 Psycho flow rap, all you do is talk trash 
 Raw perico, black from Puerto Rico 
 Popping large, big shout from the east coast 
 (Demoz) 
 Turn me all the way up, high as fuck 
 The industry not high enough 
 You eye in eye with the higher you, but there ain't no "I" in "Us" 
 See, Hov one of my favorites, I ain't trying to bust 
 Same way I'm unsigned, guess I ain't try enough 
 Vinnie stalk you like an Audi coming, Maserati 
 Body something, I'm dutching the lobby 
 Probably with shotties busting 
 You hot like oil, then Ag'll roast you, you get shot like photos 
 Heavy metal Glock in my photo, nigga, we'll rock and roll you 
 Off the bridge, you don't want no drama 
 I'mma catch you in the Bahamas and put your brain on your baby mama 
 Now we can talk about mills when I'm finished 
 Hennessy was a popular drink and it still is 
 I'm 'bout to turn these faggot niggas into mannequins 
 It don't even matter why I'm mad again 
 Kill him at the Vatican 
 He a square? Kill him at the Madison Garden 
 Like a motherfucking Spartan 'cause I'm panicking 
 Nigga 
 (Vinnie Paz) 
 A muhfucker stupid if he think life fair 
 See, waking from a dream and seeing me is a nightmare 
 The chopper gon' lift this dummy out of his Nike Airs 
 Muhfucker see black mirrors and white bears 
 You see this is life here, take this advice here 
 You witnessing the second crucifixion of Christ here 
 I'm 'bout to catch a homi when I dim all the lights here 
 The bullets travel fast, but it feel like a light year 
 I came straight from Hell with a pitch black force 
 With a black pitch fork and a pitch black Porsche 
 Yous a baby food dude and your shit's that soft 
 I'm the bang, bang, body bag, click-clack boss 
 It's dark here, Philly don't bother with street lights 
 McLaren F1's move faster than street bikes 
 It's peace till the OG, give me the green light 
 I slap the ghost out of anybody that breathe hype
