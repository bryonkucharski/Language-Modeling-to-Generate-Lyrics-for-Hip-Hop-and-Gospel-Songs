I feel reinvigorated, don't fuck with the boss 
 I'd rather cut my own throat before suffering loss 
 Anybody fucking with me get hung on the cross 
 I have anger in me, don't make me summon the source 
 I go to war with the Glock 
 I go to war with anybody motherfucker, I'm a sorcerer ock 
 Fucking everything whether the bitch is gorgeous or not 
 I murder everything, that's just some of my torturous plot 
 If you righteous and you under attack 
 Like the Anbar Awakening and Sons of Iraq 
 The fifty cal is like a thunderous clap 
 If you think that you safe and nothing wrong that's a presumptuous act 
 It ain't no tomorrow, I don't got a dime saved 
 And if you did it's in the Wall Street crime wave 
 It ain't nothing worse in the world than a mind slave 
 Going to war with my people how I define brave 
 I'm a monster 
 Ain't no one can fuck with the kid 
 I'm a monster 
 My jail brothers stuck with a bid 
 I'm a monster 
 Everything I do is precise 
 I'm a monster 
 Pazienza ruin your life 
 I'm a monster 
 Ain't no one can fuck with the kid 
 I'm a monster 
 My jail brothers stuck with a bid 
 I'm a monster 
 Everything I do is precise 
 I'm a monster 
 Pazienza ruin your life 
 Yeah you know that Vinnie he been nice 
 Y'all don't belong inside of the ring like you Kimb' Slice 
 I ain't gonna take all of your skin, just a thin slice 
 They call me John "The Beast" Mugabi when Vin fights 
 Vin Laden, Taliban, Hamas, and Al-Qaeda 
 You a snitch cop lover, you fuck with a traitor 
 I'm a motherfucking brick you constructed of paper 
 I dumped the motherfucking clip now you dust and you vapour 
 I was there when all the planets was born 
 Before the Continental Drift and when Atlantis was formed 
 When Gandhi told the Indians to stand and be strong 
 And took the British out with intellect in spite of their brawn 
 Everything Pazienza do is hard body 
 I don't care if you Blood, Ñeta, or Godbody 
 I was devilish before the power of God got me 
 I just think I let the fucking sword of Allah chop em 
 Mossberg nine thirty-five is amazing 
 The Prada high-tops the same colour as raisin 
 He a rat, not even his mother can save him 
 That's what you get for being brothers with Satan 
 The thirty-eight practical, the Glock is for fair 
 And this for jail brothers something they can knock on the tier 
 Yeah, I'll stick a knife in your esophagus queer 
 I'm an animal, every rhyme will demolish you queers 
 Gas high but you can get the D for a real price 
 This Sig Sauer 1911 is real nice 
 I'll stick through the wrist with a steel spike 
 And now maybe you'll overstand the pain of the real Christ
