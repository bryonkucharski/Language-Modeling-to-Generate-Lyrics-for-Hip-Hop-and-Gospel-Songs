(Verse 1: Reef The Lost Cauze) 
 We puff cigars and sip Jesus juice 
 Do get dough I don't need a booth long as crack smokes and needle shoots 
 Yup, unbelievable, a lethal crew where evil rules 
 I be in Cali smoking diesel, you never leave the room 
 You in your crib just clickety clacking 
 Typing messages about how niggas be rapping 
 Like he used to spit fire like really what happened? 
 You really need cabbage 'cause you're simply a faggot cocksucker 
 While your jaw's tight, eh yo I'm sick 
 I got a wild bitch who strangled you to death like Arturo's wife 
 Rest in peace to all of those who died tragically 
 Steve McNair got a nigga scared to eat at Applebee's 
 I mean Dave and Buster's and I don't give a fuck about my own life 
 So it's nothing for me to take another's (nothing) 
 The bitch is a freak, she said take a number 
 We ran trizznain, that bitch say take a number 
 (Verse 2: Burke The Jurke) 
 Hey yo I weigh about a deuce and a half 
 And manoeuvre too fast for you losers to grasp 
 You're not eluding my wrath 
 Grab the duffel bag and shoot, the loot and the cash 
 I subtract you from your stash and now you do the math 
 I sit on the church steps with the booze in a flask 
 I love the sound of the music from a funeral man 
 Want me to google your producer man, you dude should just ask 
 I see through you like glass and my goons just laugh 
 Take a swig of the Grey Goose, take a trip to Jesus 
 Get your gay troops, turn your strip to Beirut 
 This is fight music, I ain't ? the comrade 
 This is combat, give your sister her son back 
 I'm repping OPG, you got OCD 
 Your shit is one dimensional, my flow's 3D 
 They they say that I'm as gritty as ODB 
 Dirk McGurk but they call me Burke the Jurke 
 (Verse 3: Vinnie Paz) 
 Pazienza and Lost Cauze drunken with the four-fours 
 I just mangled the fucking mic pussy, it's all yours 
 I don't need to spit sixteens, you done in four bars 
 Fat motherfucker, I only eat it if it's four stars 
 When you knocked out cold it's hard to fight back 
 Street pharmacist with more pills than Mike Jack 
 I don't wanna listen to y'all, y'all shit is tight whack 
 I been eating rappers for years, you just a light snack 
 Eh yo Sharif burn these motherfuckers at the stake 
 They ain't gonna get a chance to learn from their mistake 
 Death is coming for you motherfuckers, save the day 
 Everything I spit is equivalent to a Mason's hate 
 This is Pazienza, the Official Pistol Gang 
 And we was born and bred in Killadelphia, Pistolvane 
 The thirty-eight, a four-five, see every pistol bang 
 They can levitate your body and they can rip through brains
