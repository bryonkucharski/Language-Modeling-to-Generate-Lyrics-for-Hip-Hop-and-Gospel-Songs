Godson, large guns, hard drums 
 Problems, plastic livers and hard lungs 
 Far from, a colourful artist 
 Untroubled regardless, humble and cautious, zoology starts 
 Game of Throne, we upend the farthest 
 Check out my horoscope, I'm the lion in the jungle 
 Rob you niggas on the ave, you buy a hundred bundles 
 You don't understand struggle? I'll rob you for your gun tool 
 I'm barkin' on police, monster on the beats 
 Got a chop it in the car? Gotta chop it in the streets 
 Make it hard for you to breathe, Parkinson's disease 
 And part of my beliefs don't make it hard for me to squeeze 
 I'm starting to agree, niggas don't love us 
 Niggas don't want us, niggas don't trust us, niggas can't touch us 
 My life that's on paper? That's the shit that I publish 
 Stab your sister in private, your brother in public, nigga 
 You can't kill me I'm dead already, his head is petty 
 My metal heavy, G-O-D of the Serengeti 
 Crazy Eddie machetes, I keep 'em in a Chevy 
 My metal heavy, G-O-D of the Serengeti 
 Just a young boy doing broke man shit 
 Running through the hood with a big four fifth 
 Spit on your poster, clique full of vultures 
 One shot, bet I'll leave your liver on your shoulders 
 I'll make your heart stop beating, your wife start cheating 
 She speaking with a mouthful of semen 
 We angels, y'all demons 
 If you think that you can fuck with the gods you're dreaming 
 Cause my flow is like hell when you battle me 
 You bout to step into the realms of reality 
 Let's get it poppin' motherfucker 
 For playing with pimping now y'all paying expenses 
 Like doctor bills, you're not for real 
 I cock the steel over pot and pills, even cops get killed 
 On the block with a Glock before I got the deal 
 I don't care, somewhere there's a slot to fill, nigga 
 You can't kill me I'm dead already, his head is petty 
 My metal heavy, G-O-D of the Serengeti 
 Crazy Eddie machetes, I keep 'em in a Chevy 
 My metal heavy, G-O-D of the Serengeti 
 The Dim Mak teacher, the book of Enoch reader 
 The five deadly venom chest beater, the chess teacher 
 The guest speaker, the Miami flesh eater 
 I'm the physical of severely compressed ether 
 Carry wisdom of a severely distressed Gita 
 The act of cowardice you display is your best feature 
 Chastiser of the enemy, Death's reaper 
 Logic dictate experience the best teacher 
 I gave him two choices he didn't deserve either 
 Confession doesn't work to a deeply disturbed preacher 
 Everything is painted with blood from a snub heater 
 Father please instruct me on how to perform pitra 
 Smoked in every country a lot of the bomb reefer 
 Poked in every country a lot of the don divas 
 I was resurrected by tropical storm Jesus 
 I was then selected to slaughter deformed fetus 
 You can't kill me I'm dead already, his head is petty 
 My metal heavy, G-O-D of the Serengeti 
 Crazy Eddie machetes, I keep 'em in a Chevy 
 My metal heavy, G-O-D of the Serengeti
