"The fuck you say now, huh? Hey, huh. Bam bam bam. Mothafucka I'm strapped. You don't fuckin' talk now, huh." 
 Verse 1 - Vinnie Paz: 
 I got the AR-15, let me hit his head 
 Heard us running up inside the crib and then he shit his bed 
 I ain't trying to hear nothing cousin give me bread 
 The only thing inside the duffel bag shrunken heads 
 That's how motherfucking grimy we are 
 You don't wanna see how motherfucking violent we are 
 Yeah or where the motherfucking silencers are 
 What the Asiatic motherfucking sciences are 
 I know you saying that this motherfucker curse a lot 
 I'm just trying to balance out the fact you rock a purse a lot 
 I heard you suck dick and walk around in skirts a lot 
 Listen to Kanye West, recite his verse a lot 
 Pazienza I don't rock with that soft shit 
 We juice crew Hilltop hardcore shit 
 We got the ? digger uncut raw shit 
 To put his motherfucking body in the morgue shit, yeah
