I slaughtered and slaughtered, then fathered the father of Hiram 
 Enhance him, I'm Brody and all of the strongest of gaijin 
 I walk on the water and fall in the Czarkham asylum 
 Mind of Einstein combined with the heart of a lion 
 How you think the social media equal to grinding? 
 I ain't playing with you people, 'cause people is dying 
 Leave this motherfucker leaking, don't even revive him 
 Not standing for truth, cause the e-equal is lying 
 Refer to the murder of herd as no longer adjacent 
 I'll turn this gray man cave to a burgundy basement 
 Refer to the word of the Earth as the perfect displacement 
 Chief black Thunderbird is no longer a Mason 
 How you call yourself God when you talk like a vagrant? 
 Put your hand on the Qur'an and then alter your statement 
 Rhyme cheetah, swine eater, he calling for bacon 
 I be in Saks Fifth, having this all for the taking 
 ((x2)) 
 I keep a couple ratchets in the Louis duffle 
 I keep a hundred racks inside the Louis duffle 
 I run inside of Saks and got the Louis duffle 
 The Book of Law, .44 in the Louis duffle 
 You keep the truth from a thinker and he find it regardless 
 The only son of Osiris was resigned to the Godless 
 The master was teacher and teacher, the father of time 
 You know what happened to the seven MCs in the line? 
 You could call it proficiency or call it design 
 You could call it a gift in me or call it a shrine 
 You could call it malignancy, the thought of you dying 
 I pray to God that he christen me and offer the wine 
 The mental, the father, supporter that follow the craft 
 The end of the honor, the order of Solomon's wrath 
 The sender, the armor, the slaughter, the fall of Shahbaz 
 The lender, the ender, the fallen, the fall of the crash 
 He knew that he would be murdered, so he went to Tibet 
 They hid a personal word in the T-Temple Aset 
 There's an unholy clutch in the fifth and the four 
 Superhuman intelligent prediction of war 
 ((x2)) 
 I keep a couple ratchets in the Louis duffle 
 I keep a hundred racks outside the Louis duffle 
 I run inside of Saks and got the Louis duffle 
 The book of Law, .44 in the Louis duffle 
 Die motherfucker die, die motherfucker die 
 Die motherfucker die, die motherfucker die 
 Yeah, yeah, listen 
 I will utter the things 
 Which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world 
 There is nothing buried that will not be raised up 
 I am God, I am the monster 
 My son is the father and the father is my son 
 Marciano, Raise the gates
