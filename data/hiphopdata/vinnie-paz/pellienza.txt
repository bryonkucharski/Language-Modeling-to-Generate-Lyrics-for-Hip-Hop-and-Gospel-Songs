It's never too late 
 That's where they got you 
 Every day is a, every day it's the same thing, man 
 Until where you at, you don't stop! 
 Never too late! 
 Verse 1 - JoJo Pellegrino: 
 Fuck your pipe trades and paper work 
 My rhyme schemes will lay you murked 
 Fire breeze and flames, get burnt 
 Bars bleeding pain and hurt 
 Thoughts, demons, dames and dirt 
 Watch me and they observe 
 Behind the dreams footage like a mob scenes ?? ?? 
 Spark diesel haze and perks, spittin' the cushion 
 Sacrifices I've made, risks that I've tooken 
 Final option, strong arm 'em 
 If that don't work then I can tell whatever mirror I look in 
 Look it, I go through the bullshit on a regular basis 
 Rage is part of my pores that just make my music even deadly 
 Basic pages document wars, life and endorsement, four clips and I slay them 
 Hit everything moving, till everything move and hit the pavement 
 Heads get tortured in basements 
 For thinkin' that it's all entertainment 
 Get stuffed in Hefty Bags 
 Clip his ass, drop him to the bottom like ?? ?? ?? 
 Pellegrino, Vinnie Paz, none of you haters is really maggers 
 To f'ing bad, yeah 
 Verse 2 - Vinnie Paz: 
 Don't you ever look at me funny 
 If I get knocked first, then Vinnie do his snuff in his bunky 
 Destruction is nothing, dump a fuckin' slug in his tummy 
 My father told me you could learn a lot from a dummy 
 It's hot and it's sunny, that's the fucking opposite from me 
 The brain particles is everywhere, they consciousness ugly 
 My father above me, I swear on fuckin' God that's above me 
 That I will torture y'all or slaughter y'all that talk to me funny 
 I'm awful with money, especially if you're hoardin' it from me 
 Here's a dead rapper father, take this offering from me 
 You awful and clumsy, couldn't learn the sorcery from me 
 Couldn't take the Necronomicon glossary from me 
 Out my face, I ain't even tryin' to talk to you money 
 I ain't tryin' to break bread or to walk with your money 
 I'm a carnivore, I ain't never stop being hungry 
 I'm the art of war, you ain't never stopping me dummy 
 Yeah...
