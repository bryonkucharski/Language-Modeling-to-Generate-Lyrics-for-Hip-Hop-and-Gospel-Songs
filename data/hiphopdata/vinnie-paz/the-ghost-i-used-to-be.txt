(Eamon) 
 I've been working for the Devil too long 
 I've been working for the Devil too long 
 (Vinnie Paz) 
 You see, I preyed on things and then I preyed on them 
 And I took it to the corner, got paid off then 
 The destruction wasn't even on my radar then 
 And my heart was black, it was Darth Vadar then 
 It was jumbs to the bums, G packs to the OGs 
 The money came to me, I sat back with my Co-Ds 
 Money changed hands and moved on like a cold breeze 
 And I ain't give a fuck about death or an OD 
 Mama always in my ear, saying that I didn't care 
 But I ain't going back to being broke like this was yester-year 
 The plan is to try to be out in less than a year 
 No drugs, no thugs, no weapons in here 
 You see I'm trying to get out ma, but I feel trapped 
 What employer gonna hire me when I sell crack? 
 I'm not fully rehabilitated, I fell back 
 And regret is a muhfucker, run, tell that 
 (Eamon) 
 I've been working for the Devil too long 
 I've been working for the Devil too long 
 Tempt us, lead us to the edge, watch the wise turn into fools 
 The greatest lie ever been told is the one closest to truth 
 I've been working for the Devil too long 
 I've been working for the Devil too long 
 I'm gone 
 (Vinnie Paz) 
 You see, I preyed on things and then I preyed on y'all 
 My attempt was to never get paid off y'all 
 When I was young I saw politicians of all stripes 
 But all I saw was lies in they eyes and that's not right 
 I said, "When I get older, I'm going to change shit" 
 Take the welfare system and rearrange shit 
 Years later, I'm quietly moving up the ladder 
 Trying hard, realizing that it doesn't matter 
 My wife told me, "Baby, money doesn't buy elections 
 Money doesn't buy votes, it just buys attention" 
 I kissed her on the head and told her she was right 
 But she couldn't understand and see the coldness of the plight 
 Couldn't understand why it's so cold for me at night 
 Cause political bribery just hold me in a vice 
 But there's always implicitly some string that's attached 
 By a muh'fucker think he got wings on his back 
 You ain't an angel, probably, you working for the Devil 
 The nightmare of money, the league would be a rebel 
 I did all of you dirty, so I should've gone to jail 
 I took your fucking government and put it up for sale 
 Look, American democracy has been hacked 
 By the corrupt paradigm, that's a supreme fact 
 And every word that I said in this song 
 I've been working for the Devil too long and now I'm gone 
 (Eamon) 
 I've been working for the Devil too long 
 I've been working for the Devil too long 
 Tempt us, lead us to the edge, watch the wise turn into fools 
 The greatest lie ever been told is the one closest to truth 
 I've been working for the Devil too long 
 I've been working for the Devil too long 
 I'm gone
