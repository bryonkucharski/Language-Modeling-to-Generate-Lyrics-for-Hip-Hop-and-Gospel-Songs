Yeah 
 Yo, Les, what up papa? 
 Juju Gigante, y'kna mean? 
 Goblin Queens New York 
 Philly out here 
 We shining 
 Yeah, the four-fifth symphony lift him 
 It'll spin your head around like a rotisserie chicken 
 I was born on the Red Sea, Abyssinian vision 
 We ain't A-Alikes, God, we completely different 
 How much more proof you need that the boy crazy? 
 I carry four pounds like a premature baby 
 Pussy boy, coming out his mouth, all shady 
 I will punch him in his fucking teeth, all gravy 
 I'm liable to take a young boy lunch box 
 And if it's any resistance, then you gon' get punched ahk 
 I catch homis, Lord, harder than punk rock 
 I remember 'xactly where I was when they slumped Pac 
 Quintetto had everything, but got cocky 
 Philly wop with nice hands, but not Rocky 
 Mommy making manicotti, but it got sloppy 
 Yous a bitch, Benny Blanco when he shot Papi 
 Yeah, the left hook startle 'em, the end is a mean right 
 Sublime nature, I am from the sons of the Green Light 
 I could tell from your eyes, something don't seem right 
 Hands shake, brittle, so I know you the queen type 
 This 550 Sonoran, force is absurd 
 And God told me the pen is the source of the word 
 How he call himself a rapper, but he awkward with words? 
 In a city I diddy bop, walk with a bird 
 Let's be honest, money, you just mediocre at best 
 And these cop killers going to put a hole in your chest 
 I’m Vido Loncar throwing blows at the ref 
 You like Luke on Hoth, almost frozen to death 
 The straight right'll lift his fucking pussy out of shoes 
 With no counters coming back and that's the point I'm trying to prove 
 You ain't get the fucking point? 
 That's the point that I don't lose 
 You can see me muhfucker, I’ll anoint you on the news 
 Yeah
