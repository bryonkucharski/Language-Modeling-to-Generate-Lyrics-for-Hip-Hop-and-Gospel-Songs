You and your squad better praise the real god 
 Verse 1 - Jus Allah: 
 I have been to hell before 
 Befriended the Devil and Skeletor 
 Wish I could visit the fellas more 
 Wish that I could get more bodies through the cellar doors 
 I'm always thinking of others 
 Should probably think of myself more 
 But I don't worry about cells and house scores 
 I'm more into L's than house stores 
 I like wars and whores 
 Cores and shores 
 Liquor and Coors 
 Sex, cigarettes and sycamores 
 Always got one to roll up 
 And one twirled 
 All about guns and girls in this underworld 
 So I got a truckload of guns and gusto 
 But I don't go around shooting ducks and buffalo 
 I like it when the streets are crowded 
 I don't think to be discreet about it 
 Drinkin' blood beats a salad 
 So I gotta put a lot of work in 
 'Cause I'm usually thirsty again 
 Before it even leaves the palate. 
 Verse 2 - Vinnie Paz: 
 I'm shining out here 
 Jedi Mind grinding out here 
 I'm from Philly where it's filthy 
 Take your diamonds out here 
 Motherfuckers broke eating Top Ramen out here 
 Fuck the police, graph writers is bombing out here 
 Ain't nobody better at this fuckin' rhymin' I swear 
 Any second, any minute, any time of the year 
 I remember when it was nothing but violence out here 
 Now these faggots rappin' like they fucking common out here 
 I'm about to set the mother fuckin' drama out here 
 45s, gebalando, big lamas out here 
 Everybody think it's sweet 'cause now Obama out here 
 He the third cousin of Bush, he lyin' out here 
 You the lamb I'm the mother fuckin' lion out here 
 Where were y'all when my step father dyin' last year 
 I'm once in a lifetime, Haley's Comet out here 
 God's and nerfs and moors, we Islamic out here
