Verse 1 - Vinnie Paz: 
 I run with Puerto Rocs, Morenos, Costa Ricans, and some Guidos 
 My bullets quick and fly around your head like they're mosquitoes 
 The mark they leave inside your body smaller than a needle 
 The fiends here get their rock 'n' roll like they're the Beatles 
 I'm from Philly and the killers on the block is my people 
 And that's regardless of the fact they're moving rock and diesel 
 It ain't nothing for me to bust a fucking shot at people 
 For me to run up on your spot and bust a Glock at people 
 And my fam, they're waiting patiently to clap a round 
 My hands are strong enough to spin the earth and crack the ground 
 My crib like a gun store, Vinnie keep the heaters 
 And fucking with me only gets you close to meeting Jesus 
 The man that tried to battle Pazienza, he's in pieces 
 That goes for anybody else that Vinnie P. competes with 
 I'll die for any of my cousins that I run the streets with 
 And for the motherfuckers that I share the m-i-c with
