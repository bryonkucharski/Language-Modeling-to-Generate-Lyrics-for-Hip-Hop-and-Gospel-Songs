We were on a mission 
 Trying to go gun somebody down 
 I got like three feet behind him 
 And I guess he felt somebody behind him 
 And when he flinched to look back I shot him 
 I shot him right in the face 
 I seen his whole jaw just, fly 
 Just his teeth were on the sidewalk

 Yo, a-yo, it's Deni, Staten Island, slang therapist 
 Local gemologist, back like Apollo Kids 
 Brutal, stir a nigga brain like a cup of noodle 
 Tony Picasso didn't shit, but a little doodle 
 Goo-goo face, keep new boo laced 
 Screaming out, "More bass", spazzing on tour dates 
 Ding donging bitches flicking they pussy lips 
 French vanilla butter pecan, I call 'em sugar tits 
 Palming they ass, one finger in the stinker 
 Forty pound herringbone chain without a kinker 
 Minger, my fur got stashed by some chambers 
 Barracuda grip, big stones is in my banger 
 El Chapo, guns more rockier than mountain 
 Stopped the James Bond van and piss in the fountains 
 We out 
 [Vinnie Paz] 
 The only motherfucker that's thought of like he a mystical 
 It's criminal, the way that he slaughter all of the physical 
 Horror is not predictable, honor is not a ritual 
 It's Hell up in Harlem when they shot him in 1962 
 The nine is lifting you to a higher body, celestial 
 The pistol do the damage, no matter what the medicinal 
 Hiding behind municipal, got inside the invincible 
 I tried to find a rhyme that can silence the higher sentinel 
 You added to the violence, the violence is my monopoly 
 Feed 'em to the assassin, then smash 'em like he was pottery 
 Slash 'em with the isosceles, haram passed me the Wallabees 
 I'll take the Glock and flee after robbing 'em like democracy 
 How could you be honoring the fallen father, the harbinger 
 The foreigner of everything, holy call me the conqueror 
 The room darkener, I'm the toolie toter, the carpenter 
 The God philosopher, it's the holy mountain, the sorcerer
