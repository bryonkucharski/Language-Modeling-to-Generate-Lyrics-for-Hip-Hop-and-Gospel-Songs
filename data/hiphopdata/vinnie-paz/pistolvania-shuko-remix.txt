Verse 1 - Jack Frost: 
 I can show you how the nine spit 
 It's Frost, Freeway, and Vinnie from Jedi Mind Tricks, I'm on my grind trick 
 Niggas flows is hot but Frost greater 
 Y'all niggas don't exist like Luke without Vader 
 Got a young buck that remind me of Lando Calrissian 
 Smooth as Billy Dee when he sneak his pistols in 
 A Colt 45 it works every time 
 Vinnie out there drinking on that (that's right) 
 I know they out there thinking on that 
 Niggas think about creeping on Jakk 
 ? Cause his main bitch creeping with Jakk 
 Every third weekend with Jakk she sleeping with Jakk 
 How sleezy is that? 
 Y'all niggas talk George but you ain't seen the brick yet 
 I've been touching money since the kitten played ? stack 
 But a house party to me is a crib full of fiends 
 Ready to cop that ziplock ready rock 
 Hip hop started out in the park 
 That's right, we used to do it when the weed would sparked 
 When the drinks start flowing and the green starts glowing 
 If you from the hood I know you feel me, keep going 
 Hip hop started out in the park 
 That's right, we used to do it when the weed would sparked 
 When the drinks start flowing and the green starts glowing 
 If you from the hood I know you feel me, keep going 
 Verse 2 - Vinnie Paz: 
 Who the best motherfucker in the street that you never heard? 
 The 45 separate your head and it severs nerves 
 Call me Koko B. Ware, I carry several birds 
 I'll demolish enemy scholars with every deadly word 
 These motherfuckers don't know the pain that the steel is doing 
 I'mma let 'em take it back to the block and explain it to em 
 Cut a motherfucker head like Hussein would do him 
 Take his motherfucking bread now it's painless to him 
 And feed the pitbulls that man's bones 
 'Cause I'm here to fuck the game up like Pac-man Jones 
 I'm Kobe with rock, if not I'll fucking zone in the spot 
 But if you disrespect my mother or my home then you shot 
 I'm lonely a lot and that's the type of person who's deadly 
 And the 50 cal make your face look like spaghetti 
 Look at this feti, look at all this beautiful shit 
 A south Philly scumbag wearing Gucci and shit 
 It's over 
 Hip hop started out in the park 
 That's right, we used to do it when the weed would sparked 
 When the drinks start flowing and the green starts glowing 
 If you from the hood I know you feel me, keep going 
 Hip hop started out in the park 
 That's right, we used to do it when the weed would sparked 
 When the drinks start flowing and the green starts glowing 
 If you from the hood I know you feel me, keep going 
 Verse 3 - Freeway: 
 This is Jakk Frost, it's your boy Vinnie, Philly Freezer 
 We do it proper cause hip hoppers they really need us 
 I tote the semi if you ? you won't really see it 
 How about a tough guy scream when he's shot 
 I ran terror from the same era as Biggie and Pac 
 This is ? we will plot you leave you paraplegic 
 You never there, I'm everywhere 
 I say I'm there then believe it 
 When you see me Louis Vuitton here in the drop yeah 
 Philly Freezer get paper all year 
 New Year's I'm on the ball, I'll be there when it drops 
 These snitch niggas saying I'm near when I'm not 
 Bet you when the bodies dropping they start calling the law 
 Rockafella heat spitters, Desert Eagle heat holders 
 Philly Freezer keep soldiers that'll ride for the cause 
 The AK will heat niggas, it'll flip your Jeep over 
 If these niggas try me probably catch a body tomorrow yeah
