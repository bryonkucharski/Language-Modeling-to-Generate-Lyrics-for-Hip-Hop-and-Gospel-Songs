Verse 1 - Apathy: 
 Yo I'm a bastard, the aftereffect of passionate sex 
 I came out the bassinette blasting a TEC 
 Look out your window, see Ap passing your jet 
 With Superman in a headlock and a gat to his neck 
 Fuck kryptonite, Pixar bloods and crips on Krypton 
 Superhuman powers, a cape with house slippers on 
 I kept it real, money's never my Achilles heel 
 I'm like Cliff Lee going for the Phillies deal

 I'm a rebel with mics, I'm Daredevil with sight 
 I can be the peacemaker, I can set off the fight 
 Don't provoke us, fuck around and get your death notice 
 I'm just trying to raise awareness, I ain't talking about chef's focus 
 I'm like a combination of George and Frank Lucas 
 You ? you catch locusts, eat mucus 
 So don't you ever step, never rep, you will never get better 
 So get clever and drop the motherfucking mic forever

 Stepping out of ? with a spliff of sensi 
 Running with them boys called DGZ 
 AOTP performing and they ain't no joke

 Shitstorm your label flipping over tables 
 Professor X out of the chair, fully able 
 Wolverine up in the booth slicing your cables

 This my kind of beat, the body will feel it, the mind is weak

 This is hustle music nigga, we grind and eat 
 Fuck a hater, feel this razor that's inside my sneaks 
 My brother Ap blap blap this is Honkey talk 
 The flow is tighter than how a fucking honkey walk 
 This junkyard calls, call a coroner 
 Undertake you, break you, the ultimate warrior

 Yeah million dollar man, Ted DiBiase shit 
 Ralph Macchio flow winning like Karate Kid

 Army of the Pharaoh clique, the rest of y'all are so-so 
 Me and Crypt are like the legion of doom 
 You can't defeat us and we putting nonbelievers in tombs 
 Verse 6 - Crypt The Warchild: 
 Murderous arrangement using words to just play with 
 Guilty by association at my arraignment 
 Nightcrawler, knife brawler, fight harder 
 Pipe ? if I'm dead I'm a mic martyr

 We get gully, grime pays and y'all peddle y'all music 
 You got a new album, nobody listening to it

 Appetite is galactic, it's like eating satellites 
 An iceberg cyclops that freeze the blast of light 
 When this bastard writes it mics the afterlife

 This Demigodz get the job done effortless 
 Got 'em waiting on the kid to drop like a pregnant bitch 
 Verse 8 - Celph Titled: 
 I ain't from this planet, your human rap skills are just lukewarm

 Angering actors, action-packed factoring 
 Factions in Anchorage, Alaska waving an axe at you 
 My unfortunate orthodontist astonished 
 That I had cobra's teeth, I bit him in his shoulder meat 
 All's fair, I floss yeah the boss here 
 Won't keep you in my prayers but I'll keep you in my crosshairs 
 Verse 9 - Vinnie Paz: 
 Vinnie San-hammer, Paz hit you with the blam blammer
