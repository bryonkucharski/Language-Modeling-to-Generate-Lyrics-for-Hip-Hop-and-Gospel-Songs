(Verse 1: ~Vinnie Paz~) 
 This is Taliban rap, I'm a fucking bomber* 
 My head wrapped like somebody who suffered trauma 
 Musically I'm the embodiment of Jeffrey Dahmer 
 Usually in the environment of marijuana 
 My straight right like Arguello was 
 You a medigon, Vinnie do what a dego does 
 You about to find out what the human tornado does 
 You a bitch, you ain't even half what you say you was 
 My shit is hard body lord, I'm a fucking legend 
 I don't get my hands dirty, that's for fucking henchmen 
 I'm the equivalent of Russian Roulette, fucking tension 
 And when you hear the ram's horn it's the fucking ending 
 I'm a vampire, I love the setting of sun 
 The night my time killing already begun 
 I'm from the same place Anton Lavey is from 
 I'm about to put the biscuit right to my head and be done 
 (Chorus: ~Demoz~) 
 This Percodan got me feeling like a brick wall 
 With that said I give a fuck about a withdrawal 
 Fuck a quarterback, bullets get you picked off 
 Critics get pissed on when I'm pissed off 
 This Percodan got me feeling like a brick wall 
 With that said I give a fuck about a withdrawal 
 Fuck a quarterback, bullets get you picked off 
 Critics get pissed on when I'm pissed off 
 (Verse 2: ~Demoz~) 
 1978 my mom had a date 
 '84 had me, had a hard time great 
 Mom wasn't weak, I guess my dad wasn't fake 
 But guessing only led to one thing, my mistakes 
 That's why I cut the grass real low, check for snakes 
 Apply pressure when I need to satisfy my weight 
 Selling coke and the diesel 
 Fiends going crazy putting dope in their needles, it's hopeless and evil 
 You can smoke wet and get smoked with the Eagle 
 All over nothing, fucking pride and your ego 
 Spit all facts, I ain't gotta mislead you 
 Talk shit wherever you stand, that's where I leave you 
 Believe me, I can get you killed real easy 
 Leave the scene but the ho won't leave me 
 Tackle the dresser, bitch try to tease me 
 I put a hole in her head right where her weave be, believe me 
 (Verse 3: ~I'll Bill~) 
 I'm the bomb attached to the chest of exploding martyrs, code of honours 
 Shoot me out your M16, deliver souls beyond the world 
 To conquer planets and enslave entire populations 
 Colosseums where Hamas supply the operation 
 Gladiators battle on the side of sovereign nations 
 Fathers of confrontation, Lamas to pop your face in 
 Blinded by lies and hatred, they conjure up abomination 
 Armies march across the continents honouring Satan 
 The final countdown, 2012 
 Jumping out the Black Hawk with the black Eagle by the money belt 
 I take you from the edges of space to the projects 
 From the pyramids to Giza to where God sits, we monstrous 
 I'm conscious homie, I'm wide-awake 
 I supply the hate, La Coka Nostra 
 The skull and guns, I supply the weight 
 How many bricks you want? Let me see your money first 
 As a matter of fact I'm taking your money you fucking herb 
 Fuck outta here, Billy Idol, La Coka Nostradamus
