Verse 1 - Ill Bill: 
 It's the habitat of the gasmask, suitcase nukes 
 Exploding iPhones, artificial intelligence to cyborgs 
 Every man, woman, and child shall be identified 
 By a microchip implanted and injected in the eye 
 Peep how they operate, beat you in the mouth with rape 
 Fuck you in their face, bang you in their crown with shanks 
 Navigate through crowds of snakes, pounds of shake 
 Miles of flakes, that dickface's smiles is fake 
 Produce rage like Tom Morella out for scrilla 
 Move weight like an eBay Power Seller 
 My sounds of terror beat games Mega Therion 
 Carry on, life is like an epic 
 The chariots of God, lost children scheming to floss 
 Sum up'll cost billions, dollars in digital 
 Monsters with pistols who transcend beyond the physical 
 Rocket launcher missiles cruise like the words I use 
 Until collisions prove catastrophic 
 Satanic prophets in space capsule cockpits 
 Watching demons and angels clashing in the moshpits 
 Welcome to the Apocalypse, the final step, the final conflict 
 The final concept is not death, listen... 
 Verse 2 - Vinnie Paz: 
 Everybody is a cyborg and the recession is fake 
 They had me fucked up giving a confession to jake 
 I ain't wanna get knocked but I guess it was fate 
 I'm a fallen angel, a descendant of apes 
 I'm an ancient astronaut, I'm from the Nephilim race 
 Biochip is here so you get arrested and raped 
 Hitler never died, they just faked his death and escaped 
 It was genocide but they never questioned the hate 
 I was petrified, now I rock a vest and I'm safe 
 And these stupid motherfuckers have obsession with faith 
 The world's welfare rests with the congressional snakes 
 This is Hell here, just look at the president's face 
 All I saw was darkness at presidential debates 
 My mind too strong moving at exceptional pace 
 And the AR-15 just leveled the place 
 Now we live in Thunderdome unacceptable place 
 Verse 3 - Slaine: 
 Got a crazy feeling, certain people watching me walk 
 I'm too high to know who the fuck's dropping me off 
 Why the fuck my knuckles are so covered in blood 
 Somehow I got a funny feeling that the government does 
 Check one: no bank account, no bills in my name 
 Check two: no jobs, taxes, or children to claim 
 Fuck I think they can trace me, basically chase me 
 Erase me in facing the paper they basically 
 Made me famous, I hate this, I'm wasted 
 I'm strapped on my back like a fucking lunatic patient 
 I'm not going crazy, they're swearing I'm maybe 
 Erica, please take care of the baby 
 Baby, don't be hysterical, hysteria's hazy 
 Always knew how my mysterious ways be 
 You just thought I was lazy on the couch 
 Instead I was feeling the taste of the gun in my mouth 
 Ouch!
