 (Ras Kass) 
 Cerebellum Cerberus dog, I'm three-headed 
 Who your favorite rapper, my sock puppet, tell 'em I said it 
 High octane, my veins pump unleaded 
 Go hard on beat but this speed got me embedded 
 No post telemedic, I'm k-k-kinetic 
 So up jump the pump on the Ku Klux pathetics 
 I remember we in Ferguson right now 
 Republicans evicted that black dude from the White House 
 Couples racists, pointed hoods, stupid night gowns 
 This is for Selma, this is how a fair fight sounds 
 I spit patriotic treason 
 For every black body you left hanging from the trees and 
 Niggas on steroids thinking you He-Man 
 Stoupe said you was gayer than three seasons of Glee, man 
 Every bar is coca-ina, nothing but keys and 
 Logical like Vulcans, we be throwing up V's, deezam 
 Boys to men, shazam 
 This is diving in volcanoes with a Go-Pro cam 
 Latinas love my gangstas, say I'm loco man 
 Like fucking pregnant chicks, how I go so ham 
 Hard as a motherfucker 
 Off the wall, nigga

 (Vinnie Paz) 
 Boxcutter Pazzy, the razor blade and the ox with him 
 Punch this muhfucker in his chest, take his oxygen 
 Die muhfucker die, infrared dots on him 
 Vinnie put the E on the street like he Nils Lofgren 
 You could either slide or you could take that L 
 Have this muhfucker torn like an ACL 
 It's a lot of hype around you, but you ain't gon' sell 
 You know the son is going to talk because he hate that cell 
 Why I always had to be the one greasing his kids 
 Never contributed, nothing, always be in the fridge 
 I think it's hard for you to even find a reason to live 
 Run up on his pussy like I got a key to his crib 
 Fuck this ras clot, I'mma leave him dead in the dirt 
 And then pop go his mind like he Gerald Levert 
 And the gat the same color of the herald that surf 
 I got a rhyme in my mind that'll level the earth
