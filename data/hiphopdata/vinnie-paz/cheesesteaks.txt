(Verse 1: Vinnie Paz) 
 A knife in my palm, sharper than a sniper in Nam 
 Righteous Islam, a hypocrite that fight to be calm 
 My life is just torn, bipolar, icy and warm 
 My life in a song, the reason why the Vicodin gone 
 A bison is born, army of God, Michael is born 
 The Uranium fission secret of the hydrogen bomb 
 The Bible is gone, y'all are watching a viking perform 
 And the 9 milli loud so the silencer's drawn 
 I'm live from the war, I don't believe in crying at all 
 I'm a manic depressive, never get excited at all 
 I'mma live forever, don't believe in dying at all 
 I was born peaceful, I was never violent at all 
 Then my father died, that was like a knife through my core 
 Any love I had inside me not alive anymore 
 Lion of war, Joseph Dredd, I am the law 
 I'm the reason faggot rappers can't thrive anymore 
 Yeah! 
 (Hook: DJ Eclipse) 
 Class is in session, so you can stop guessing 
 Who the fuck I be (Boxcutter Pazzie) 
 Focus, on what has to be done 
 Son, you know where I come from (Philly) 
 (Verse 2: Vinnie Paz) 
 My little man will blow your face off 
 I flatten out bodies, I ain't talking about a race horse 
 Murder every rapper then I break off 
 Scheming on this motherfucking money, Bern Madoff 
 Y'all was always pussies so stay soft 
 The only time beef is mentioned around me is for steak sauce 
 I work harder than y'all, it's no days off 
 The knife work scratch and cut you up like Main Source 
 My fam walk around with hawks on them 
 Big motherfuckers, infrared dots on them 
 And ain't a motherfucker that can box with them 
 Razor under the tongue and keep an ox with them 
 Hardbody rap, God of the Serengeti 
 I'm a sinner, I'm the God of the seven deadly 
 Everything I do hard and it's legendary 
 I spit sixteen bars and you dead and buried 
 (Hook: DJ Eclipse)
