I can tell these nigga's scared the way they talk 
 Gold pyrex, I put diamonds on my fork 
 Pull up on your block, white chalk 
 Chopper bullets skate, Tony Hawk 
 I'ma cut your fingers off if you shout 
 Pop a perc, hit the cup, nigga pause 
 Hundred round drum, round of applause 
 Bitches know I got that bag Santa Claus 
 I drink lean and I pop Xans 
 Slaughter Gang, we the Glock clan 
 Poppin' molly nigga, San-Tan 
 I'm back on that bullshit again 
 I wanna fuck your best friend 
 I just went a bought a brand new Benz 
 Bitch I came from the bottom 
 We was starving, we was robbing 
 Mind your business, bitch 
 Mind your business, bitch 
 Mind your business, bitch 
 Mind your business, bitch 
 We ain't with that friendly shit 
 That friendly shit 
 That friendly shit 
 That friendly shit 
 Catch 'em out back, roll the window down and smash 
 Another toe-tagged nigga laying in the grass 
 Five shooters in the back of the Uber nigga and they ready to shoot 
 I tie my laces, I dip in that bag nigga and I take me a boof 
 I'm the Slaughter King nigga, I don't give a fuck about you 
 You get you some money, you get you some fame, these bitches gon' come out the blue 
 Bullet holes in my body, paranoid I'ma pop it 
 If you snitchin' I'ma pop it, wrong move, I'ma drop it 
 .15 in my sock, trappin' at the bus stop 
 Came from a nickel rock, now I got a whole block
