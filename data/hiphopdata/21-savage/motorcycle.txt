 She gon' ride it like a motorcycle (6x) 
 She gon' ride it like a motorcycle, throw it back baby recycle 
 Bitch I'm bleeding like I'm on a cycle, I be leaning baby no NyQuil 
 And I can't stop it, keep going baby don't stop it 
 All my garments come from France, French kissing in France 
 Hundred thousand stuffed in my pants, money piling up like ants 
 And I can't stop it, keep going baby don't stop it

 Pull up on a nigga with a rocket, if I pull it out then imma pop it

 Finger licking good like shrimp and teriyaki 
 VVS diamonds got my watch playing hockey

 Pull up on your block with the chop cocked back 
 Pew pew pew, make a nigga walk back 
 1017 they need to bring the wop back, when I get inside that pussy baby I can't stop 
 I love it when I see them nipples through the crop top 
 Butt crack showing in them G-Star jeans 
 Make a nigga wanna go and buy her a ring 
 She gon' turn a nigga to a fiend, she gon' make a nigga kill the scene 
 She gon' hold my dope when I'm in need, she gon' bail me out when I'm in need 
 She gon' ride it like a motorcycle, throw it back baby recycle 
 Bitch I'm bleeding like I'm on a cycle, I be leaning baby no NyQuil 
 And I can't stop it, keep going baby don't stop it 
 All my garments come from France, French kissing in France 
 Hundred thousand stuffed in my pants, money piling up like ants 
 And I can't stop it, keep going baby don't stop it
