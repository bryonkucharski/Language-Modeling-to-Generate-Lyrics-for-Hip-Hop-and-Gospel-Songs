Man I feel like I deserve this shit 
 I bought a Bentley because I deserve a new whip 
 She cheated on me so yes I deserve a new bitch 
 These niggas wasn't with me, they didn't help me grind for this shit 
 I buy some chains for the bro's, I don't got shit for these ho's 
 Is you a friend or a foe? Is you gonna cut a nigga throat? 
 Ain't no more going back broke, ain't no more sharing no clothes 
 Ain't no more selling dope, 12 can't arrest me no more 
 Shootouts on shootouts on shootouts on shootouts 
 Young nigga done been on them shootouts 
 Where yo ass was at dog when we was at when we hallow a nigga with the 2's out bitch 
 Compton Red's in the cut tryna hit the dope, nigga where the cut in 
 Tied his partna up in the cut 
 Me and Lil Harold had took a laptop 
 That nigga had bussed so the nigga got popped 
 Me and Johny tried to rob everything 
 Mookie tried to tell us, do the right thing 
 Larry died man I cried twice 
 Chevy went down the road nigga twice 
 They tried to give my nigga Teetay life 
 Tip and Metro nigga ready to fight 
 I keep lotto with me, real ripe 
 Pussy niggas, nigga we don't like 
 Free Lil Tooto, he gon' open a fight 
 RIP Tayman that's why I got that knife 
 I don't get excited about the fame 
 Bitch I'm still with the same gang, bitch I still claim the same thing 
 Still take a pussy nigga chain 
 Man I feel like I deserve this shit 
 I bought a Bentley because I deserve a new whip 
 She cheated on me so yes I deserve a new bitch 
 These niggas wasn't with me, they didn't have me grind for this shit 
 I buy some chains for the bro's, I don't got shit for these ho's 
 Is you a friend or a foe? Is you gonna cut a nigga throat? 
 Ain't no more going back broke, ain't no more sharing no clothes 
 Ain't no more selling dope, 12 can't arrest me no more 
 12 can't arrest me no more, ain't no roaches on the floor 
 Ain't no flowers in this clique, ain't no flowers in this shit 
 We done cut the snakes off, had to cut them niggas off 
 Niggas don't wanna see you with nothing, unless you giving these niggas something 
 I had to get me some money, bitch and that drum hold a hunnid 
 You run up, you know that I'm gunning, 2Pac nigga, thugging 
 A lot of niggas changed on me, I just bought some chains on me 
 I just bought a Range Rover, this shit ain't 'bout the fame homie 
 Mookie told me I deserve it, momma told me I deserve it 
 I know if Tayman was alive, he would tell me I deserved it 
 I got the sack and start splurgin', balling like I'm James Worthy 
 Pussy niggas ain't worth it, before I did some other murders 
 Man I feel like I deserve this shit 
 I bought a Bentley because I deserve a new whip 
 She cheated on me so yes I deserve a new bitch 
 These niggas wasn't with me, they didn't have me grind for this shit 
 I buy some chains for the bro's, I don't got shit for these ho's 
 Is you a friend or a foe? Is you gonna cut a nigga throat? 
 Ain't no more going back broke, ain't no more sharing no clothes 
 Ain't no more selling dope, 12 can't arrest me no more
