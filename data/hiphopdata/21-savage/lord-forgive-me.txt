A hundred a zip and I'm sippin' on drop 
 I hit for a hunnit' and I bought me a drop 
 I pulled up on her and panties just drop 
 Up 32 shots and you niggas gon' drop 
 I'm from (?) give a fuck bout your block 
 High speed chasing, give a fuck 'bout the cops 
 When I see 12, put the dope in my sock 
 Niggas be rappin', I came up off rocks 
 I'm thuggin', I'm thuggin', I feel like I'm Pac 
 They tried to betray me 
 I'm mad at myself 'cause I keep it real with all these niggas 
 Niggas actin' like bitches, niggas all in they feelings 
 These niggas acting like women 
 Drowning in money, I'm swimmin' 
 These bitches acting like pigeons 
 I just want a couple million, I just want a couple million 
 And I'm still loyal to the game 
 These other niggas man, they lame 
 I really sold cocaine, Gas stank propane 
 Glock forty, nigga bang, Blood, Crip, nigga bang 
 I heard ya got ya chain took and had to get another damn chain 
 21 nigga the gang, slaughter ya daughter the gang 
 Mac 90 got range, young savage got aim 
 I bought a new Rollie, its plain, you niggas best stay in yo lane 
 I pull up and fuck on yo main 
 I'm covered in money, I'm drippin 
 These niggas they telling, they snitchin' 
 So we gon' fuck on all they bitches, I be round lot of henchmen 
 Moving like I'm John Gotti, 12 gauge nigga shotty 
 Hit 'em all in the body, I just caught another body 
 Lord forgive me I'm sorry, I can't help it, I'm a street nigga 
 I had to get some money, I watched my momma struggle 
 I jumped off the porch, had to use my muscle 
 Lord forgive me, lord forgive me, lord 
 They keep askin' why I got that sword in my face (Tayman) 
 Lord forgive me, lord forgive me, lord 
 I just beat another case 
 I just went and bought a Wraith 
 I just nutted on her face 
 Brand new rollie with the face 
 No face, no case 
 Lord forgive me for my sins, I was struggling tryna win 
 I had to lose a lot of friends, nigga tryna chase them m's 
 Cooking up crack its illegal, riding with a desert eagle 
 I'm a felon, that's illegal, main bitch, she illegal 
 Hunnid pounds of Cali reefer, Call of duty heat seeker 
 Pull up on ya in a regal, window down nigga creeping 
 Nigga rapping? I'm preachin', nigga we are not equal 
 In the trenches, niggas beefing, I remember not sleeping 
 Hit the club and get to squeezing, shoot it up for no reason 
 I was living like a demon, I was living like a demon 
 Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the lord, my soul to keep 
 If I should die before I wake, I pray the lord my soul to take 
 Lord forgive me, lord forgive me, lord 
 They keep askin' why I got that sword in my face (Tayman) 
 Lord forgive me, lord forgive me, lord 
 I just beat another case 
 I just went and bought a Wraith 
 I just nutted on her face 
 Brand new rollie with the face 
 No face, no case
