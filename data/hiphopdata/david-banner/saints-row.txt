Got a bitch, 
 Got a bitch, 
 Ya'll know me 
 Mississippi ho, I'm a real O.G. 
 Yeah! (x8) 
 If ya sick of being sick, and ya tired of being broke 
 Go get yo guns and bring yo ass to saint's row 
 (Saint's Row!!) Bitch!, (Saint's Row!!) Bitch! 
 If ya wanna do the led on the flow, Bitch 
 I lost it, I steal 'cause, nobody cares how I feel but Saints row! (Saint's Row!!) 
 Saints Row (Saints Row!!) (x2) 
 Ya left me in the middle of hell wit no hope 
 Ya put me in the trap wit straps and no dope 
 No food no water, kids drownin in the mist 
 I ask god why my people gotta live like this 
 I loot, I shoot, Getcha ass that's survival 
 Police, two bit slugs on the rival 
 Helicopter's come, but they leave wit nobody in em 
 Send em all to hell wearing gasoline denim 
 My dirty white T is as bold as my outfit 
 Aw that's the black fist 
 Middle finger up like antennas, 
 gather up the kids, they can live wit David Banner 
 If ya sick of being sick, and ya tired of being broke 
 Go get yo guns and bring yo ass to saint's row 
 (Saint's Row!!) Bitch!, (Saint's Row!!) Bitch! 
 If ya wanna do the led on the flow, Bitch 
 I lost it, I steal 'cause, nobody cares how I feel but Saints row! (Saint's Row!!) 
 Saints Row (Saints Row!!) (x2) 
 This Is For Gulf Boy 
 Long Beach Past Christriana, 
 Watch a grown man crying, life slippin from his hands 
 America is fake, and aint never gave a damn 
 But they'll Bust they ass to help out a foreign land 
 Can't live wit myself and not ride for the weak 
 Little kids can't eat, bodies floatin in the streets 
 G.B. on the TV givin a fake speech 
 If I die, then I'll die tryna feed Mississippi 
 This is 8 times worse than inner 9/11 was, 
 Hurricane hit, 3 days, No help cuz, 
 And I wonder where my president was.. 
 I wonder where my president was.. 
 If ya sick of being sick, and ya tired of being broke 
 Go get yo guns and bring yo ass to saint's row 
 (Saint's Row!!) Bitch!, (Saint's Row!!) Bitch! 
 If ya wanna do the led on the flow, Bitch 
 I lost it, I steal 'cause, nobody cares how I feel but Saints row! (Saint's Row!!) 
 Saints Row (Saints Row!!) (x2) 
 Yeah! (x8) 
 Saint's row! 
 Yeah! 
 Saint's row!

 Saint's row! 
 I lost it, I steal 'cause, nobody cares how I feel but Saints row! (Saint's Row!!)
