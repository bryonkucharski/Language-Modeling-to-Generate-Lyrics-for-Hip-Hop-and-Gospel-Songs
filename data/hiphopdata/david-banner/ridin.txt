 Album: Beautiful Mix 
 Song: Ridin' 
 David Banner: 
 I'm from a place 
 Where You gotta let yo' nutz hang 
 Where them crakas used to cut your stomach open 
 Just to let your fuckin' guts hang 
 Right there in front of the kids 
 I might as well split your Whig 
 'Cause that's just what the master did 
 But now I'm the new Nat Turner 
 Spreadin' something to the kids 
 Like Sojourner, Man, the truth 
 Fuck a 'Creek 
 ? I care but you in doubts? 
 And go "Woof" 
 He ain't dead 
 What pledge 
 There's a stank up in the Busch 
 Or a stank up in the White House 
 Shootin' board bullshit 
 Man, it's dead props 
 Here in Chicago 
 But hit this hi-lo 
 Warriors come play 
 Click the bottles 
 Cock them AK's (Yeah!) 
 Bust on KK's (Yeah!) 
 With the Knuckle boy 
 Or the Other Two 
 And the Stic-Man 
 Given Dead on your shirt 
 Like a Wristband 
 You a Grown Man 
 Nigga, Stand tall 
 Don't it hurt 
 'Cause you really 
 Ain't a Nigga, dog? 
 Don't it hurt 
 'Cause you really 
 Ain't a Nigga, dog? 
 (Yeah!) 
 Don't it hurt 
 'Cause you really 
 Ain't a Nigga, dog? 
 Country boys, city boys 
 Cadalacs, Rolly Royce 
 Whatever... long as we Ridin' 
 Pretty girls, ghetto boos 
 On the boulevard, in the avenue 
 It's a long a walk 
 Now that we Ridin' 
 Dead Prez: 
 Yo' 
 Niggas is not original 
 Niggas follow the radio 
 Niggas think if You Blow 
 Then You gotta be on the TV Show 
 Crackas is hypocritical 
 Crackas will rob and shit on You 
 'Cause see You do what they do 
 They know freedom is powerful 
 Niggas is very visual 
 If we see it, we think it's true 
 Very few niggas make a move 
 And even less'll see it through 
 Crackas make up the chemicals 
 Then they call us the criminals 
 Crackas make all the loot 
 And we just get the residuals 
 Niggas will rob and shot on You 
 Crackas will drop a bomb on You 
 Niggas is having funerals 
 Crackas is having barbeques 
 Niggas sing the blues 
 That's reminicin' the spiritual 
 But when You say GAWD is You 
 Niggas ain't really hearing You 
 Crackas like to capitalize 
 Them crackas a lie 
 They say if You don't ?unionnize? 
 Then You'll probably die 
 I hate callin' niggas niggas 
 So I'ma take it backwards 
 I ain't got now love for whithey 
 I love callin'em crackas (CRACKAS!) 
 Country boys, city boys 
 Cadalacs, Rolly Royce 
 Whatever... long as we Ridin' 
 Pretty girls, ghetto boos 
 On the boulevard, in the avenue 
 It's a long a walk 
 Now that we Ridin' 
 Talib Kweli: 
 Yeah! 
 I call myself real 
 N-I-G-G-A 
 'Cause Kweli be 
 Showin' on the floor 
 And they policies 
 My philosophies 
 Show you that the block 
 Is a part of me 
 Freedom Fighter 
 Like Richard Carter be 
 It's deep how the street knowledge beef 
 'Cause it ran like a code inside of me 
 It's practical, not scholarly 
 Now why do I call myself 
 A nigga 
 You ask me 
 Who's got my back 
 When the cops harass me 
 Y'all can label 
 Cinncinatti 
 Can ride the train 
 Or with the Caddie 
 When they call you 
 Nigga they scared of You 
 They fearin' You 
 So actually 
 If CRACK is gone 
 Be fearing Niggas 
 Then that's what the 
 Fuck I have to be 
 Now 
 It's a badge of honor 
 And some say that 
 Shit's upsurd 
 It's more than 
 Just a word 
 We flip the shit 
 Like it's a 'bird 
 Pass it down through 
 Generations, then 
 Cuss you out and say it loud 
 The first generation 
 Of Muthafuckas 
 To grab Our Nuts and 
 Say it proud 
 Country Niggas or City Niggas 
 Tupac Niggas or Biggie Niggas 
 In the coridor, floor or door, 
 And all my Mississippi Niggas 
 We connected 
 All throughout 
 The North, the East, the West, the South 
 And if a Wyte boy say the shit 
 He'll still get punched 
 Right in the mouth 
 Country boys, city boys 
 Cadalacs, Rolly Royce 
 Whatever... long as we Ridin' 
 Pretty girls, ghetto boos 
 On the boulevard, in the avenue 
 It's a long a walk 
 Now that we Ridin' 
 (Ending 2x) 
 All they got for You 
 Is a Cell my Nigga 
 They want You 
 Dead or in jail 
 Without Rebel my Nigga 
 In the streets 
 It's similar to Hell 
 My Nigga 
 But we gonna Boss up 
 And live well 
 My Nigga
