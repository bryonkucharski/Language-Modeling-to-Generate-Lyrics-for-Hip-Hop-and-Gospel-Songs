David Banner: 
 Yeah he buy you clothes I hit it from the back 
 Yeah he drive a benz I'm in a woodwill Cadillac 
 He readin you poetry while I'm spittting this country game 
 You want us just play this pimpin' don't be ashamed 
 It's a shame these soft pretty boy mean nothin' 
 Since these that comin' through for you then start busting 
 We out cussin like macks and ready for car jacks 
 Rollin' up on a slab with yak and some fat sacks LIKE THAT, yeah 
 Sky: All these bars all these cars all these big time superstars 
 All these ladies at this bar watch these haters play their parts 
 You can't stop me or my pimpin' 
 Cause you lame and you be simpin 
 I'm like Micheal you be Pippen' 
 Table Dance but Sky ain't tippin' 
 Sky: the sight of you 
 The smell of you 
 The way you move 
 Has got me in the mood 
 You seem so cool 
 You're style is smooth 
 My search is done 
 'Cause I found you 
 9:15 and baby the night is young plus you you told me that you were gonna 
 Give me sooommmee... 
 Hey baby girl what's your name who wit 
 Do you do wanna get down with this pimpin' lil' trick 
 Tell me what you like 
 What you love we can do no matter what it is I can make it come true 
 Never gave da benz the ferrari or the lac tell me what you wanna drive and you got it like that 
 I'm givin' you the chance dis the opportunity 
 You can have it all but ya gotta choose me 
 Sky: came in theresa, Michelle and Felicia, Jackie and Rene', Raquel and Shey Shey 
 Erica and Kiki, Shimiki, Shone, and Mi Mi, Beverly, Byina, Teritone and Hottie 
 Aww Janae and Jane, Mocoa and Blue Flame, Carolyn and Marilyn and Angie and Shamane 
 Brandie and Aleyah Shamari and Nakeisha, Shawna and Janelle, Lucy, Mona Lisa 
 Sky: the sight of you 
 The smell of you 
 The way you move 
 Has got me in the mood 
 You seem so cool 
 You're style is smooth 
 My search is done (X2 while chorus repeats in background) 
 David Banner: choose me big Banner the back beater 
 The dubz can't fit on the truck they caught fevers 
 25 inches I can clear the benches or we can go up and down like them rug bitches 
 Let them hatin' witches they gonna wish for hate 
 But they all scream damn while ya masturbate 
 The worm on the hook I can whip and cook hit the block with chunky socks while you hit the books 
 I make that sacrifice like Jesus preachers on them lames 
 I'm true with how I feel, no fingers crossed dis ain't no game 
 But you a pimp mayn I promise y'all that I can change 
 Like a chameleon the colors on your rings 'n' thangs 
 Sky: you can have what you want 
 If you give me what I need 
 I know you have a lot of options(so many other ways) 
 But baby you belong with me oh oh
