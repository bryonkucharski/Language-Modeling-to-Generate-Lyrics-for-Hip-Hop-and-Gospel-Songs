No matter how hard it gets 
 You can make it 
 God loves you, I love you 
 We love you, we really do 
 You know and um, for me 
 It ain't about nobody else 
 It's about me, you know 
 And if I have to do what's right for my spirit 
 And do what's right for God 
 And do what's right for these kids 
 And do what's right for my people, alone 
 Then this is what I gotta do 
 But I don't believe I have to 
 I believe the world is ready for it 
 Sex, drugs and video games
