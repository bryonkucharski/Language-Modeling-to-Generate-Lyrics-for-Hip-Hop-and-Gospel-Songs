 WOO! Oh... She looks so beautiful, don't you agree? 
 Girl, you know what I think you should do right now? 
 You should just take off all of your clothes 
 Every article of clothing, except for the, 
 Leave the pumps on girl, I like that 
 Enough of the kissin' and huggin... 
 We should be fuckin', on da bed on da couch now, 
 Fuckin', fuckin', fuckin'... 
 From the front to the living room, we should be fuckin' 
 (David Banner) 
 Let the boys make love, 
 Let me fuck ya from da back, hair pullin, hot wax

 They can't do it like this, 
 They won't tie you by your wrist 
 And spank ya lil sexy bad ass, cum quick (hey),

 Yeah I know your boss a jerk, 
 You can come to da platter, tie you up, witcha skirt 
 Let ya man make love, 
 Let me bring ya to da crib, you a big city gurl 
 Let me show you where I live, 
 Gotta pond in da front, gotta lake in da back 
 If you wanna pop da trunk, 
 We can do it in da lac, 
 Got a dick like a horse

 Girl gon' lose ya mind, 
 Let my dick touch your spine, 
 Cum 4 or 5 times,

 And all ya freaky dreams I wanna make come true, 
 Like fuckin' on da back porch,
