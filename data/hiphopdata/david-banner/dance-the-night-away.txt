Look at your body, your man needs help 
 Stop your selfish, I get next 
 Take my hand, I'll do the rest 
 Tell me what you want, girl, is it S-E-S-E-X? 
 Daddy don't want you hanging with a thug 
 I bet he's thinking we go, ha ha, ha ha 
 Breathe real hard, the sweat is dripping all over your body 
 Let me give you what you're missing 
 Grab your coat, grab your coat 
 Slap your car, slap your car 
 Girl, let's ride, girl, let's ride 
 Girl, let's ride, come on, let's ride 
 I feel the need to sleep ya, to sleep 
 Me and you should be dancing in the sheets 
 I can do what I want to 
 I can play by my own rule 
 Come with me let's just dance the night away 
 Don't worry 'bout what I do 
 Watch me as I move on the floor 
 And let's dance the night away 
 Whoa, the night away

 I've been thinking we should get lost all of your clothes 
 Let's take them off except them pumps 
 Leave them on your feet, girl 
 Give it to me now, I'll make you weak, girl 
 Hey little woman, what you gonna do 
 Live in the past, move on to something new

 We ain't go much time for acting brand new 
 Oh no, I don't follow no rules

 Ot's my life and I can't be 
 Like you I can only be me some call me a rebel 
 You wanna be one let's go 
 It's your life so gonna do you 
 Don't let no one control what you do 
 Grab your coat, grab your coat 
 Slap your car, slap your car 
 Girl, let's ride, girl, let's ride 
 Girl, let's ride, come on, let's ride 
 I feel the need to sleep ya, to sleep 
 Me and you should be dancing in the sheets 
 I can do what I want to 
 I can play by my own rule 
 Come with me let's just dance the night away 
 Don't worry 'bout what I do 
 Watch me as I move on the floor 
 And let's dance the night away
