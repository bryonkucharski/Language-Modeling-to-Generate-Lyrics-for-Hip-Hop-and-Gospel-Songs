 Chris Brown: 
 The name you know of 
 A little bit change now your boy done blown up 
 And I'm doing things that gets exposed 
 Stunting ain't a thing to me 
 And it's obvious it's plain to see 
 That you gone make us both 
 Get into some things 
 That'll scare grown folks 
 Shi* they might even say 
 You should leave me alone 
 Don't be scared 
 You need to get like me 
 Stunting is a habit 
 Just gotta have it 
 Shawty can throw anything at me 
 I'm gonna bag it 
 When she sees the carats 
 They real just like a rabbit 
 Can't no other boy 
 Do the things you like 
 He ain't your type 
 Change your life 
 And if you did your homework 
 Girl I'm pretty sure you know what I got 
 Drop top singing Jones on road 
 Let me stop
