Do you believe in love? 
 And the promise that it gives 
 I wanna love you for life 
 'Cause your love is why I live 
 Banner when you coming back? 
 Tell me when I ever left? 
 I got two tatted on my spine 
 You on my mind and in every breath 
 Have I ever went on TV and not call your fucking name? 
 Yeah I slept with other dames, but my love for you don't change 
 Give a fuck what haters say 
 Bitch go drink some Gatorade 
 Bitch I get that money too 
 Never wood all in your face 
 But when I'm gone I'm gettin' cash 
 While them niggas on they ass 
 Fat as fuck fallin' off 
 While I keep my foot all on the gas 
 Keepin' my hand all up on the grain 
 God on my heart, money, or my brain 
 I got a little money but my heart didn't change 
 I bet a mothafucka gon respect your name 
 Don't smoke that much, ain't on that dust 
 Keep some hen all in my cup 
 Take my fingers twist them fucks 
 Say your name and throw it up 
 Do you believe in love 
 And the promise that it gives 
 I wanna love you for life 
 'Cause your love is why I live 
 You always on my mind when I'm on the road 
 Doing shows, puttin' it down 
 For me and you, I remain true 
 And represent till I'm underground 
 You do the same just as I would change 
 Hold your curb while the caddy swang 
 On them fuck niggas that ain't fuck with ya' 
 Cause of your past, until I came in yo life 
 I ain't ashamed to call you my wife 
 All these other hoes been' trife 
 Ain't no secret I be creepin', but I dedicate my life 
 To your warm embrace, skin as soft as that red clay 
 Heart beat like a 808, in my old school when I blast the bass 
 Rep this hear all in they face 
 Proudly say you in a southern state, of mind 
 Ain't no other worth my time 
 And when I set ya' out, you shine 
 For the world to see that you was meant for me 
 And I love you so 
 Mississippi I'm foreva with ya' through thick and thin 
 I just need to know, do ya'... 
 Do you believe in love? 
 And the promise that it gives 
 I wanna love you for life 
 'Cause your love is why I live 
 Why they wanna talk about us? 
 They ain't never really gave a fuck about love 
 They ain't never really gave a fuck about you 
 A fuck about me, the S to I.P 
 The J to A.C 
 The D to A.V.I.D B.A double N.E.R 
 Rolling up 55 like a split cigar 
 All of my folks yellin' out 'You can't make it nigga' 
 I did though for my kin folks 
 You can't crush my heart it's been broke 
 In your river I been soaked 
 When I hear your name it gives hope 
 Don't smoke that much, ain't on that dust 
 Keep some hen all in my cup 
 Take my fingers twist them fucks 
 Say your name and throw it up 
 (Scratches) (YEA) 
 Do you believe in love? 
 And the promise that it gives 
 I wanna love you for life 
 'Cause your love is why I live
