 Where My Soul Still Don't Feel Free 
 Where A Flag Means More Than Me (IN MISSISSIPPI) 
 Verse 1 David Banner 
 Still ridin' cadillacs 
 Still bump in the back 
 Mothafuckas talk shit but we still in the hood

 Crackas only come to buy crack 
 And cracka cops only come to bust niggas who sell that 
 We From A Place Where Dey Scream
