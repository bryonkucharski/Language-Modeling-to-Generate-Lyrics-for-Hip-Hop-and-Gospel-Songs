It was just me in that red Astro van 
 A box of CD's and a pistol in my hand 
 A pistol in my hand, a pistol in my hand 
 It was just me in that red Astro van 
 A box of CD's and a pistol in my hand 
 A pistol in my hand, a pistol in my hand 
 Yeah them boys talk down and they all going hey 
 I give it all to the Lord so I called this song Faith! 
 I called this song faith, yeah 
 Mississippi nigga with a 50 sack of weed 
 I told them I got that Cali but this here from Tennessee 
 Sick of leavin' over knees so I had to move quick 
 I ain't tryin' to ball pimp I'm just tryin' to hit a lick 
 Then I met this young miss it was back in 96 
 At a house party rollin' up some dolja in a swiss 
 Really thought she was a trick so I hit her with my pimp game 
 Step out to my lac and I'ma show you how to grip grain 
 I'ma show you how to mix them sprite with them eights 
 Show you how to ride rock steady on them skates 
 At the time I never knew this girl would be my soul mate 
 She said keep me close and ill keep your ass safe 
 Then I taught country slang and we rolled from my estate 
 Gave her an AR and started bustin' on them fakes 
 Then she whispered in my ear no matter how long it takes 
 You can make it, every myth about your home and your state 
 We can break it, and no matter what you do let them boys know you smart 
 Stand up for the poor and keep God in your heart 
 Now matter what you do let them boys know you smart 
 Stand up for the poor and keep God in your heart 
 I remember falling to my knees asking God for some tracks 
 He said, make your own son you ain't gotta sell crack 
 Cut them sappers like they raw and let them fiends smoke that 
 Go to N-Y-C on faith, I'm thinking to myself my Lord is that safe? 
 Uncle Swac gave me a pistol and I left the next day 
 Homies in Manhattan till I met Mrs. D-A-Y 
 In her home she let me stay, studio to studio 
 Me I'm on my grind, everybody at the crib thought I lost my damn mind 
 The Noreaga bossed up and bought a beat 
 This put me on feet, I found a damn way to eat my Lord 
 Two years later I'm in the A pimp 
 But in my soul I feel I need to move back to the Simp 
 A town they showed me love, they put me on the map 
 But if I love Mississippi I gotta move back 
 So stop in Birmingham man just for a minute 
 Niggas stole my red van man and everything in it 
 Drum machine keyboard and all of my clothes 
 But I had my pistol with me I'ma kill these hoes 
 When I left I was with little homie in the Regal 
 So I grabbed my cell phone and I called Big Siegel 
 I said, "Meet me in the Ham big boy it's going down" 
 God yelled, "Stop my son and turn around!" 
 They took your possessions but your souls on safe ground 
 2 months later I was riding through the Ham 
 Gotta ten million dollar deal y'all, damn! 
 Haha that's faith my nigga, 
 Thank you Lord, thank you
