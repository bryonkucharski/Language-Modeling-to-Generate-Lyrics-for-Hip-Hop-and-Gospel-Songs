Mississippi, 
 Big faces 
 In the south till the day that the lord comes to get me 
 This is how it was growing up in Mississippi 
 When I ran around the hood in big K's and troops 
 When the Quintin boys were just gangs group to mess with 
 I remember man when Chucky got shot, yeah 
 Lying there bleeding man Jackson mall parking lot 
 Before the vice lords and folks, 
 Before my friends started to buy, cook up and sell dope, 
 Before we all wanted to thug, 
 Me and Chucky up in stopped goin' a two man lady bug 
 David Lewis June 4th Chris Tall you and Keith Robinson 
 Bozo and me, Circuit Los and with it Antwon 
 Fuck it man we older left the story, move on 
 Goin' to the brooke just see my momma Leena 
 Before I learned to shop your ass silly with the neena, yeah 
 I get by with some help, with some help from my friends [Repeat: x2] 
 I get by [Repeat: x4] 
 With some help from friends y'all, 
 From my friends y'all, yeah 
 Sugar on some light bread roaches on the wall 
 On the weekends all day walkin' through the mall 
 That welfare cheese and them red tangled blocks be 
 Boxing in the corner so that bass wouldn't knock 
 Your uncles coming over sippin' yak smokin' weed 
 They let you take a hit if you wouldn't tell T 
 And talk about yellow niggas talkin' to the feds 
 Man the real locked up, on dope, or just dead 
 Man head to my grave had to holla at Michelle 
 Put some roses on the ground toss some juice and then bail 
 First cousin, best friend, all that I had 
 Me and her on the porch bumpin' JJ Fat 
 Supersonic, its ironic that you're gone I'm alone 
 But I'm not 'cause I'm feeling your presence in my bones 
 I wish you could of lived to see your cousin get grown 
 But you died and left here trying to get by 
 Just like to say man 
 We need to get back to goin' to grandma house 
 Lil' kids playin' football in the streets 
 From the south y'all 
 Big face 
 You know, you know, you know 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
