Pick up your gun 
 Jump in the whip 
 Lets ride on this like oh oh oh (x4) 
 I put that on everything 
 -I will be reppin the south to the day that I die 
 I put that on everything 
 From the midwest I'm ready to ride because I'm from the Chi 
 I'm from the M I'm from the Double the S, y'all know the rest 
 Talk about that and I'll dig in yo chest 
 Ready to die for these streets so hit you with with this heat 
 You don't want to see T and DB and I put that on everything (x2)
