We don't have to worry 'bout no money, to have us a real good time 
 And we don't have to leave in the morning, the whole day just you and I, 
 And it don't have to get any better, it's perfect you in my life. 
 If you're cool, then I'm cool, then we're cool 
 We don't have to worry 'bout no groceries, we can fill up on love alone, 
 If we ain't got enough for a movie, we can just sit at home 
 Have a little role play baby, whatever turns you on 
 If you're cool, then I'm cool, then we're cool 
 If you're cool, then I'm cool, then we're cool 
 Quit your worrying baby 
 Quit your worrying girl 
 Quit your crying lady 
 We can conquer the world 
 Pack a lil' love for the evening, let me hold you tight 
 Don't be worried about my problems believe me- everything's gonna be all right 
 Watching cartoons, whatever makes you smile 
 If you're cool, then I'm cool, then we're cool 
 If you're cool, then I'm cool, then we're cool 
 Ain't nobody worried 'bout no money, and we still gonna have a good time 
 Like JJ, Thelma, and Willona, we gonna have a good time 
 We can take a stroll in the park, holding hands walking side by side 
 Drop the top down on the lac, feel the breeze and take a lil' ride 
 You know I love the southern stuff baby 
 Fish and chicken with the hot fries 
 And we a perfect match, I'm the ham and you the good collard greens on the side 
 Don't worry girl 
 Don't worry, no 
 We're all right 
 Hold On, Hold On
