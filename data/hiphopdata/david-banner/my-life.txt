Chorus -- David Banner 
 I can hear it in the cold of the night, y'all niggas wanna take ma life (oh) 
 I been tryin' ta do right, but they still wanna take ma life (oh) 
 I can hear it in the cold fo the night, y'all niggas wanna take ma life (oh) 
 I been tryin' ta do right, but they still wanna take ma life (oh) 
 Verse 1 -- David Banner 
 I can feel it in the night time 
 I say the lord gave life, but these niggas wanna take mine 
 I heard it through the grapevine 
 They ain't have to feel, they'd rather see me burnin in hell, n that's the truth 
 They'll set you up got proof, think about the 12 dicipes 
 What one traitor did to Christ, for small cheese 
 And they'll do it to me, damn and they'll do it to you 
 It only takes one in your crew 
 To cock back, black, and take ya life from you 
 To cock back, black, and take ya life from you 
 ...Damn... 
 Verse 2 -- David Banner 
 Think about the slave trade, we sold our own juss to get paid 
 And now adays its tha same thang, let ya braids hang 
 White folks contributed, to gang bang 
 Gain, dope slang, gain, mayn But we all some thugs 
 The same one that you love will kill ya ass for drugs 
 Come to the funeral with kisses and hugs 
 For ya mom, ya sister, ya brother and all 
 And really all they wanted was to see you fall 
 Bestfriend dead for this nigga can ball 
 Bestfriend dead so tha streets can ball 
 ...Damn... 
 Verse 3 -- Sky 
 Sometimes I tend to lose my faith 
 I'm askin god to hear ma case 
 If you could see it through ma eyes 
 They all wanna see me meet my dimize 
 I feel alone to lose my mind 
 Beggin god juss send me a sign 
 Tryna do the best that I can 
 Be a man and follow gods plan 
 I been tryin' to do right but niggas wanna take my life 
 I been tryin' to do right and niggas wanna take my life
