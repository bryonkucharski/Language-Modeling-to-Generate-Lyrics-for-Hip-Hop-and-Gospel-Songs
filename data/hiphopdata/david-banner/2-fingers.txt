See, all we need is a couple, let's go act up 
 Wouldn't believe the scene up in my black truck 
 A couple shots of Hennessey 
 And if you down get down, if you ain't 2 fingers peace 
 Got mine, got wine to make 'em act up 
 I got 'em damn near naked in the 'lac truck 
 A couple shots of Hennessey 
 And if you down get down, if you ain't 2 fingers peace 
 You can tell by the car we's some good [unverified] stars 
 Quarter backin', mackin' hoes pullin' ass from the bars 
 Run it back to the truck, let her suck on a swish

 Or bring her nigga money and make up 100 stash
