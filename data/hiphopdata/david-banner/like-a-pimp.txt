 Make them girls get down on the flo', on the flo' (2x) 
 Lil' Flip 
 By the time I hit the door 
 I saw hoes on the flo' 
 Niggas dressed in suits 
 Tricking all they dough 
 Me I'm a pimp 
 I ain't paying for no sex 
 Man I'd rather buy a car 
 Or a new Rolex 
 'Cause I got street fame 
 So hoes flock like birds 
 I got one hoe in the range 
 And another in the surbs' 
 When I hit the club 
 Imma be wit David Banner 
 A thug ass nigga 
 Wit bad table manners 
 We act bad (my nigga what is y'all saying) 
 Like when we walk inside clubs 
 Niggas hold they gal's hand 
 'Cause they know we run trains (choo choo) all night 
 How could yo gal leave me 
 And be wit you all night 
 But it's all right 
 Cause you know we don't kiss 
 Like Too $hort said 
 Bitches ain't shit 
 I tried to told ya 
 That most girls really freaks 
 And dis is how they gotta 
 Make they money every week 
 (Chorus: repeat 4x) 
 Real girls get down on the flo' on the flo' (2x) 
 Like a pimp 
 David Banner 
 Step into club looking just like a pimp 
 We got cash so we screaming out "shake something bitch" 
 This is your song 
 Tell the DJ put it on 
 Micheal Tyler made you shake 
 Sisqo made you show your thong 
 Bitch I'm dead wrong 
 The playa from the crib 
 So get out on the flo' 
 And girl get it how you live 
 And since you so hot (hot) 
 Then show yo pussy lips 
 You go to Tugallo, but I know you still flip 
 Bitch don't trip 
 Ain't a damn thang changed 
 I still love my queen 
 But bitches keep me to the game 
 So if you gotta hoe 
 Shake 'em up and let 'em go uh 
 And let them girls get down on the flo' on the flo' 
 Like a Pimp 
 Lil' Flip 
 Now don't you hate them ole' 
 Lying ass hoes 
 Smiling in your face 
 Wearing her best friends clothes 
 I suppose 
 They like the way me and Banner pimp 
 You can catch us at Poppa Do's 
 Eating steak and shrimp 
 David Banner 
 Or you can catch us at E&J's pouring it up 
 Flip whipping Cali trucks 
 Guls licking my nuts 
 We some south side pimps 
 And we ain't giving a fuck 
 Fuck yo gul up in the throat 
 And make her swallow the nut 
 Lil' Flip 
 We make em 
 Swallow the nut so 
 Follow the truck

 We got all of the bucks and 
 All of they sluts and 
 All of the hoes 
 So drop it like it's hot girl 
 Touch yo fucking toes
