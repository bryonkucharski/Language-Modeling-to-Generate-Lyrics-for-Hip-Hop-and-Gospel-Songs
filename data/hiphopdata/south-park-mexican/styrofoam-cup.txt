Uh, all alone on my throne with my styrofoam. 
 I'm all alone on my throne with the styrofoam. 
 With the muthafuckin' styrofoam. 
 (Verse 1: Baby Bash) 
 I'm a fool 
 I'm a nut 
 I'm a nigga from the cut 
 Split the blunt roll it up 
 And the deuce is what I chunk 
 I'm a prosper 
 Spittin' street gospel 
 Baby Basherini man the modern day apostle 
 Lacin' up my boots 
 Man I'm slappin' on my spurs 
 Smokin' on derb 
 In the Burb hittin' curbs 
 And buy when that occurs 
 My music's gonna splurge 
 Automatic causin' havoc 
 'Cause I caused a power surge 
 Wit the California herb 
 H-Town wit the lean 
 These million dollar words got me on that big screen 
 I ain't gonna lie 
 I'm in it till I die 
 So muthafuck you America's apple pie! 
 (Chorus:] [Baby Bash:] [x2) 
 It's just me and my Styrofoam Cup 
 Gone off that lean & a pocket full of blunts 
 It's just me and my Styrofoam Cup. 
 "Hoes say I'm so mean 
 When my niggas freestylin' 'bout the same ol' thing." 
 (Verse 2: Grimm) 
 See I flip what I got 
 Turn cold to hot 
 Twist the knot 
 Turn the block 
 Hell I hold the spot 
 Drop a line 
 Friend of mine 
 Spend my word on the cut 
 You got the time 
 I got the pine 
 Plus the syrup in the cup 
 Get the soda the more the merrier 
 Laws in the area 
 Steady stare at ya 
 Break the barrier 
 I'm a take care of ya 
 See 
 You work with me 
 I'll do dirt with you 
 We could do 2 or 3 
 But it be worth a few 
 In and out 
 But know we done connected the city 
 To the county cross state 
 And we break 50 50 
 Split the scene 
 Make the getaway clean 
 For the cream 
 Live the dream off the bean 
 And I love sippin' lean. 
 Russell Lee: 
 You know we never sober 
 Givin' money in the soda 
 We heavyweighters and soldier's 
 Pushin' big bulldozers 
 You know we never sober 
 Givin' money in the soda 
 We heavyweighters and soldier's 
 Pushin' big bulldozers 
 It's just me and my lean. 
 You know what I mean? 
 I'm on the scene 
 Stackin' my green 
 I done finally accomplished my dream 
 I'm givin' it up 
 Not givin' a fuck 
 Pourin' shit up 
 Happy P pass the Styrofoam Cup. 
 (Chorus:] [Baby Bash:] [x2) 
 It's just me and my Styrofoam Cup 
 Gone off that lean & a pocket full of blunts 
 It's just me and my Styrofoam Cup. 
 "Hoes say I'm so mean 
 When my niggas freestylin' 'bout the same ol' thing." 
 (Verse 3: Ikeman and Lil' Villain) 
 (Lil' Villain and Ikeman) 
 Well I'm gone. 
 Well I'm gone. 
 Well I'm gone. 
 Well I'm gone on codeine. 
 Promethazine. 
 Ikeman: 
 Iced up bezatine 
 Wit a whole new team. 
 Lil' Villain: 
 Candy green 
 Purple lean. 
 Ikeman: 
 If you know what I mean 
 I'm takin' the 8 with grape 
 I'm goin' hard it's all great. 
 Lil' Villain: 
 I'm sippin' drank state to state 
 Shut 'em down till they break. 
 Ikeman: 
 We some Mexicans sippin' drank 
 Lil' Villain pass the dank 
 I'm goin' hard in that thing. 
 Lil' Villain: 
 It's That vato 'bout his bank. 
 Ikeman: 
 Once you make it in the game 
 It's all the same up out my chains. 
 Fuck with them 
 It ain't no thing 
 We shut 'em down 
 We ain't playin'. 
 Ikeman and Lil' Villain: 
 We some South Side flippers 
 Codeine sippers 
 In the candy coated Cadillac smokin' Swishas. 
 Baby Bash: 
 It's just me and my Styrofoam Cup 
 Gone off that lean & a pocket full of blunts 
 It's just me and my Styrofoam Cup. 
 Chorus:] [Baby Bash: 
 It's just me and my Styrofoam Cup 
 Gone off that lean & a pocket full of blunts 
 It's just me and my Styrofoam Cup. 
 "Hoes say I'm so mean 
 When my niggas freestylin' 'bout the same ol' thing..." 
 "Sip codeine 
 Hoes say I'm so mean 
 When my niggas freestylin' 'bout the same ol' thing. Cause..."
