(First Verse) 
 My sweet Lac fall back just creepin' on three wheels 
 A bitch to my right cocked giving me cheap thrills 
 I see meals, coming down my path 
 In the ghetto cat's wrath making math 
 I'm the last to blast, on that ass now you the past 
 It's no joke you get smoked like buddah grass 
 Who the fastest punk em' like cashes 
 And when I crash this you catch whiplashes 
 Bitch I'm on a mission to listen and give descriptions 
 Hung G's in my hood in their intentions 
 I hear gunshots ringing like hell's bells 
 I see drug sells check out my thug tales 
 Fuck jails, bank swells keeps hella grip 
 And I can sell dope on ice, and never slip 
 They serving Kibbles N' Bits while I'm cooking bricks 
 Save my crumbs for the ones who sucking dicks 
 I made it rich on the ditch you quick snap 
 I left that cut now they wonder where the brick's at 
 My green shit stacks, still clip packs 
 Thirty-six lead homies so don't trip jack 
 It's the wet back hitting on the bongs 
 Son in the long run, I'll be the strong one. 
 If you step in my hood bitch you will get blasted 
 It's nothin' but that h-town g-funk 
 (Yeah this is for all them hustlers in Hillwood, South Park. Huh.) 
 (Second Verse) 
 I told yah, boy you must have caught amnesia 
 Trying to jack now you're on your back breathing anastesia 
 You got blasted 'cause you trespassed it 
 They never lasted, in the game I mastered 
 You stupid bastard, tell me what's your final word 
 Before I let this lead tip hit your spinal cord 
 Oh you was ready just begging to gank me 
 Now your ass is just dead and stanky 
 I put my foot in your shit like the hokey pokey 
 Leave the scene, now everything's okie dokie 
 Your homies know me, but they won't fuck with this 
 'Cause now they know that I could show buck a bitch 
 I'm the macker plus the gun packer 
 So you little jackers best stick to crackers 
 'Cause fucking with this mex gets your neck broke 
 Stuck like chuck straight fucked and in check Loc 
 'Cause I think fast when I'm in the slow lane 
 Get in my domain and fall back with no brain 
 So don't raid, or try to rain on my parade 
 'Cause I'm strapped from my blade, to my grenade. 
 (Third Verse) 
 My sweet Texas, restless, wanting to ride Lexus 
 Check this or flex this, I get wreckless 
 Unbelievable lyrical synical 
 Here we go mary go round I down critical 
 Street stamina dammin' a cop 
 Slammin' a punk, and jam in my funk 
 I'm the man with the skill foreal 
 Guard my grill with steel, on Sundays I kneel 
 On my knees to Jesus, please seize us 
 'Cause my boy's in trouble, and he needs us 
 Got a bat, my homie's on the double 
 Punks want trouble, I bam bam rubble 
 Still the son of a gun having big fun 
 Come and get some, I leave you wet mon 
 Fill your lead with an infared 
 I put the best to bed, they call him dead fucking fred 
 Shed my skin like a snake on a vine 
 Climbing on the crime side, coming around the blind side 
 We fall in ranks like a motherfucking pyramid 
 And I'm the top block will I stop never did 
 Make you pass the 9th grade, but got life made 
 Chose that dope and I hope I picked the right trade.
