Yo, yo... one time, one time... one time, yo... yo, yo 
 1 time when I come, 2 times when I'm done 
 Old truck like Sanford and Son 
 Next week can't recognize 
 On chrome so pretty to the naked eyes 
 That's me, on the road again 
 This 8 by 10 is closing in 
 In the hood I had it all 
 And a cold muthafucker with a basketball 
 Now I play with prisoners 
 And don't nobody trip with us 
 Some in Garza, some in Dominguez 
 Cops ask, "No speaky English" 
 And the holidays are the hardest 
 Gotta stay headstrong, regardless 
 And you are gonna have your days 
 In the place where killers have to pray 
 In the place where killers have to pray 
 In the place where killers have to pray 
 He is the last chair violinist 
 The one who brings hope 
 To those who are the last chair violinist 
 Who's pain no one knows. 
 I seen the pain in the eyes of lonely men 
 When can we ever be whole again? 
 Without Gina and my kids 
 A nigga just don't really wanna live 
 But I gotta stay free in my mind 
 Eventually hearts freeze doing time 
 No love, just respect 
 Steel shank touch his neck 
 Pick up another casualty 
 Put him in the fridge call his family 
 And his mom had a dream 
 All this would be happenin' 
 Trafficking to the rapping king 
 Everything's unraveling 
 Invest in me, it's destiny 
 I'll still wreck from the penitentiary 
 I'll still wreck from the penitentiary 
 I'll still wreck from the penitentiary. 
 He is the last chair violinist 
 The one who brings hope 
 To those who are the last chair violinist 
 Who's pain no one knows. 
 2 hits inhale, homie hold your breath 
 This is all the indo that's left 
 Watch man, don't let 'em see 
 Keep your eyes on the enemy 
 He did 20 on 70 
 Last game that he played was centipede 
 In the world, everything changed 
 Look around, things seem strange 
 All the kids in gangsta 'n' shit 
 Lil young muthafuckers living dangerous 
 Claimin this and chunkin that 
 Making more moves than a runninback 
 Up in prison, he was Christian 
 Got no job and his wife is bitching 
 So he back on the streets again 
 8 months later back in the pen 
 8 months later back in the pen 
 8 months later back in the pen. 
 He is the last chair violinist 
 The one who brings hope 
 To those who are the last chair violinist 
 Who's pain no one knows.
