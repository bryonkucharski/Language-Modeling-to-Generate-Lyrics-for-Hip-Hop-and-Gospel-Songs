Come slip into my darkness 
 Stopless, Got Rich 
 Puttin' out the hot hits 
 With true convicts 
 Block this studio, 3 month blackout 
 Rap out the bad route and those who had doubt 
 Mad shouts, to all my boys at the crackhouse 
 Catchin' every sucker who done ran South 
 Stand proud, but I can't see behingrand crowds 
 Fresh off the back street, concrete father figure 
 Niggas shiver when I deliver 
 Blastin' hollin' "Timber!" 
 Talk is cheap and most of y'all a crock of shit 
 I chop a brick and flip it like the opposite 
 'Cause all my chickens layin' 36 eggs 
 Got recruits in black boots that never shoot for the legs 
 No sunshine, streets in my bloodline 
 Love's blind, understand my Thug mind. 
 From Tex to Cali, every hood, every alley 
 Smokin' on Smally in my candy coated Caddy 
 Bendin' blocks on Goldy Locks 
 17 shots 
 Cops, swearin' to God we sellin' rocks. [x2] 
 Frost: 
 I stand in the sunset 
 Hand on my pistola 
 Late night redrum 
 Lost at Sinaloa 
 Down on the docks in Diego 
 Art Lupo in the Lexus 
 Movin; weight to Houston Texas 
 Got a chicken, finger lickin' and it's all good. 
 Then I hook up South Park Mex 
 Big green bag of cess 
 Hoppin' up and down like a Kangaroo 
 In my sky blue '62. Now what you wanna do? 
 We make shit move, like pounds and keys 
 Ain't nobody who can fuck, with these West Coast G's. 
 South Park Mexican: 
 What you tell 'em homey? What you tell 'em loco? 
 Frost: 
 Man ain't nobody who can fuck with these Gulf Coast G's. 
 From Tex to Cali, every hood, every alley 
 Smokin' on Smally in my candy coated Caddy 
 Bendin' blocks on Goldy Locks 
 17 shots 
 Cops, swearin' to God we sellin' rocks. [x2] 
 South Park Mexican: 
 Hobby Airport flight 276 
 Pick up the homey Frost 
 Let's get in the mix. 
 Now we up and creased out 
 Puffin' green Garcia y Vegas 
 Mackin' to a cheerleader from the Oakland Raiders 
 Yo Frost, peep game. Check the silicone titties. 
 Frost: 
 Yeah homes. Man they remind me of the ones in my city. 
 'Cause I've been around the world 
 All kinds of girls 
 I'm a little John Gotti 
 Duke duke of Earl 
 ShyTown, Atlantic City 
 Vegas and Reno 
 We Latino Gambinos 
 And we breakin' Casinos. 
 South Park Mexican: 
 It's the SPM, A.K.A. Caro Quintero 
 Just me and my perros 
 Flyin' through the ghetto 
 With 7 pounds of fierro 
 El Mero Mero 
 Puttin' down with that hazel-eyed Guero. 
 Frost: 
 Man orrayos, flippin' gallos, hittin' hydros 
 I'm the one that's got 'em floatin' in them bayous. 
 SPM, are you with it? 
 South Park Mexican: 
 La neta. 
 Dos vatos viviendo la vida chueca. 
 Dos vatos, Poco Locos 
 Pachando sospichosos 
 Asi trabaja, ese juego 
 Mi palabra es todo lo que tengo 
 En el monté, El Coyoté 
 Con los ojos que miran en la noche. 
 Me and Lil' John Gotti, rockin' 80 
 From Tex to Cali, every hood, every alley 
 Smokin' on Smally in my candy coated Caddy 
 Bendin' blocks on Goldy Locks 
 17 shots 
 Cops, swearin' to God we sellin' rocks. [x2]
