South Park Mexican: 
 Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times 
 Still I got thump like the boy Carmine 
 Hold the block down in my camouflage suit 
 Stomp when I walk & I'm stackin' all loot 
 Bling in my mouth but I can take it out 
 Steppin' up to me, somethin' people think about 
 Long and hard till they lose courage 
 Mad 'cause they girl beat up the malnourished 
 Picked up a star and she spunt 2 nights 
 Chilled at my crib watchin' Kung Fu fights 
 Swang & I swung from the Houston 
 Bet I go hard with no interruption 
 Woodgrain wheel with the big daddy grill 
 Higher than a hill in my automobile 
 And we roll thick, takin' no shit 
 45 on hip with the hollow point tip 
 We're comin' gangsta and gangsta's how we come 
 We're comin' gangsta and wreckin' for Houston 
 We're comin' gangsta and gangsta's how we come 
 We're comin' gangsta and wreckin' for Houston 
 Powda: 
 Break it down, watch me clown I'm a break'em off 
 Can't fuck with this Mexican Bitch from the South 
 Under oath keep it true at all times 
 Love smokin' weed & I love bustin' rhymes 
 Fine dime, stay fly keep it tight like a rubber 
 Just fuck'em, don't love'em, like my shit undercover 
 'Cause I'm a Hustla, gettin' mine by any means 
 Don't be surprised, I ain't quiet 'bout where the green 
 I like, I need, so that's how it be 
 You can hit it or quit it, believe I will proceed 
 Next, soon as I put cess in my chest 
 I forget, I ain't got time, got this record to wreck 
 My interest, myself and gettin' for me 
 So I just ain't the of type of chick you'll be hittin' for free 
 Comin' gangsta, better believe and respect 
 Me and that boy S.P. reppin' Houston Tex 
 We're comin' gangsta and gangsta's how we come 
 We're comin' gangsta and wreckin' for Houston 
 We're comin' gangsta and gangsta's how we come 
 We're comin' gangsta and wreckin' for Houston 
 South Park Mexican: 
 Yo, it's the boy Los in a smoke gray 'Lac 
 Forever be puttin' Hillwood on the map 
 Rollin' with 10 pounds of steel on my lap 
 I'm a let you know that I stay about that 
 Popped up pretty in a screwed up city 
 Might come Puerto Rican broad like Diddy 
 Might come Arabian or Venezuelan 
 'Mote control radio, 84 swangin' 
 Mix the drank up, pour it in my dang cup 
 My girl on the phone trippin' so I hang up 
 Playboy status, man it's hard to break habits 
 Go through mo' cabbage than a pack of damn rabbits 
 2 cella-tels, million record sales 
 See your boys puttin' caine in your nostrills 
 I rock Philly's, my 'Lac pop wheelies 
 Now I'm locked up with a dude that robbed Chillies 
 We're comin' gangsta and gangsta's how we come 
 We're comin' gangsta and wreckin' for Houston 
 We're comin' gangsta and gangsta's how we come 
 We're comin' gangsta and wreckin' for Houston
