[Juan Gotti] 
 Forver I'mma ride bein high fool (es el loco Juan Gotti) 
 11-45-55-2 (that's my TDC number) 
 Don't ever think of it as you ride through (smokin on Mari) 
 11-45-55-2 (Hittin that heierba) 
 Ugh Alone in my celda, smokin hierba 
 No esta buena but it hits a penas 
 Makin money in prison y afuera 
 That's my business, my drawings what eva 
 Slangin hierba diez bolas al toke 
 Slangin ink con placazos al sobres 
 Slang my cornbread, dessert and a juice 
 Saw my homeboy get shot on the news 
 Now you know what this Mexican doos 
 Come and cruise, take a walk in my shoes 
 On the cool esta vida no es linda 
 That's your boy hittin licks in the pinta 
 [Chorus: SPM X2] 
 We hit licks in the earliest of hours 
 Underneath the light and watchtowers 
 Be cool when you see the ghost 
 Dont be suprised, she's not in white clothes 
 [Rasheed] 
 Envelope with the money order, 50 should get me a mountain 
 Biness to handle when the bossman finish countin 
 Homie kinda broke and them folks call him indigent 
 Hustle out there, Hustle here, there's no sentiment 
 Sendin so many kites, call me Benjamin Frank 
 Service to everybody, 50 men in a tank 
 Meet my sister in the free, she gon send you a bank 
 While i make me a shank contraband drank 
 Food, snacks, basic commissary 
 Pay me for my picture of the what? naked Halle Berry 
 Home on a furlough, OG told me 
 Where he buried the dough, let it burn slow 
 6 months and I'll be free 
 But right now I got whatever you need, two for three 
 Broke and alone doin time comatose 
 I'mma shoot at the Bitch and see if she a Ghost 
 [Chorus X2:] 
 [SPM] 
 Cell block B, seven-B-two 
 Pass the grass but don't let'em see you 
 My heavenly jewel riskin it all 
 The finest boss lady in these prison brick walls 
 Hit the lick ma, kiss the dick soft 
 Lemme see your phone for a business call 
 If it gets long pick it up before three 
 But put it on silent so it don't ring 
 I'm the digital king, this is no dream 
 Is it real love or just a physical thing 
 Like a typical fling while I'm sippin on lean 
 Bring back some chicken cause a nigga Hung-ry 
 Connections, while I lay up in this Texas corrections 
 So the judges can win their elections 
 They locking up the muthafuckin Mexicans 
 Back with my best friends and we go 
 [Chorus:]
