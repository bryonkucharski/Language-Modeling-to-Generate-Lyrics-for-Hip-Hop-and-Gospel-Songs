(Chrous x2) 
 I can't escape 
 This ghetto imprisonment 
 Funny incident 
 To face of death 
 I'm so innocent 
 (My life is violent 
 But violent is life) 
 (First Verse) 
 ONE TIME MOTHAFUKA reach for the sky 
 All I ever wanted was a piece of the pie 
 On this chrome Microphone 
 I can Do No Wrong and can only be held 
 Back 
 For so long 
 On the tempo street info 
 How I riddow 
 If this nigga trip I turn his bitch 
 Into a widdow 
 Puffin weed 
 5 Dunn Sunny D 
 Cyber real free shit comin' from a G 
 Suddenly the Summary Ain't where you wanna be 
 Underneath a hundred G's keepin' death company 
 Quick triiga 
 Certified wig splitas 
 Ditch diggaz 
 All about big figaz 
 The last to laugh you don't have a chance 
 I come down like a motha fuckin' Avalanche 
 Blast yo azz you think we won't answer back 
 Cancel that or we blow yo motha fuckin' azz 
 In half 
 (Chrous x2) 
 I can't escape 
 This ghetto imprisonment 
 Funny incident 
 To face of death 
 I'm so innocent 
 (My life is violent 
 But violent is life) 
 (Verse Two) 
 We roc Rashade is also gettin' paid 
 Who give us a bald fade 
 Who got, just razor blades 
 Wit yo options be away 
 The game of life'll be to play 
 Wit five aces of spades 
 Three small trick up the trade 
 Radicle renegade 
 Walked in this world to play 
 Bringing faces 
 The top joka 
 Devil persuasive 
 Ain't iy amazing hoe this beer became 
 A cravin add a fukin sweet 
 Give it tea to see some mis behaving 
 Ain't no lifting balls 
 Bitches mind be like ill 
 Put you down wit these southern skills 
 Then piss in yo fuckin' grill 
 Grow deep wit back and gats 
 And all stands 
 My boyz gettin' prepared for neucin 
 The war fair hands up in the air 
 Soidlers flippin they fists 
 Fifty bald heads smoked out 
 Sloked out of piss 
 Infarred got it locked my man X 
 Marks the spot 
 Drench, then run that motha fucka 
 Down the block 
 (Chrous x2) 
 I can't escape 
 This ghetto imprisonment 
 (My life is violent 
 But violent is life) 
 Funny incident 
 To face of death 
 I'm so innocent 
 (My life is violent 
 But violent is life)
