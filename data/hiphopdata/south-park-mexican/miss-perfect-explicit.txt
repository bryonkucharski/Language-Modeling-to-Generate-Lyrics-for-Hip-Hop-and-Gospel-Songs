Helena 
 I love you baby 
 Sodapop 
 You take the breath from me 
 Make my life heavenly 
 I can't believe the way the good Lord is blessin' me 
 One in a million, mother of my children 
 Me without you like car without engine 
 You listen to my dreams that I vision 
 Respect that I smoke Mary Jane, it's like my religion 
 The pigeons, sometimes make you worry 
 But I can see, you know my vision ain't blurry 
 The innocence, still strong like a feminist 
 I reminisce, on the first time we ever kissed 
 In the devilish world you my only angel 
 Cancel concerts to stay with you and watch cable 
 Kiss your navel, candlelights on the table 
 You never cared if I was financially stable 
 12 years, to me it feels like 12 minutes 
 My love for you, sees no limits 
 Where would I be without you? 
 I know I wouldn't be rappin' into soundproof 
 I know I wouldn't be pushin' a Benz 
 I'd probably be gettin' transferred, to different pens 
 Or chillin' with my dead friends 
 Or still at the weed house makin' 5's and 10's 
 Miss Perfect, God-given 
 When I was lost, you made my life worth livin' 
 They say nothing on this earth is perfect 
 I don't believe it, you never cheated 
 Perfect record, undefeated 
 I needed a miracle to save my life 
 When I was hustlin' and grindin' late at night 
 I paid the price and listened to you bitchin' me 
 You start bringing up the past, that's history 
 Never again will I jeopardize 
 That's a promise that I'll memorize 
 Real love never dies 
 It's paradise, no matter where we at 
 The movies, the club, Six Flags, the Super Track 
 I was a dropout, no education whatsoever 
 But you stuck with me through all kinds of fucked up weather 
 Hoping days'll get better like I said they would 
 They said "Stand by your man", and there you stood 
 I was 17, now I'm 29 
 And I pray you'll be mine till the end of time 
 - Yo Ike' 
 - What's the deal Los? 
 - I know you feel me on this song, baby 
 - Man, fo sho, my nigga, I got some fo' dis 
 - Go on, wreck it, homie 
 Man, I'm at that point in my life, I lost my kid to my wife 
 And I been thinking was shife when I been up at the night 
 So I be takin' a ride and I be thinkin' inside 
 And I be wantin' to die 'cause I be wonderin' why 
 But now I know it's too late and all I got is my fate 
 And I be thinkin' real deep about my kids when they sleep 
 And where the hell I went wrong, and how to hell to stay strong 
 Cause now my babies they gone, and all I got is this song 
 Try to make it all right, but not for them but for Ike 
 And if I have one more night that I can treasure the life 
 I know I do it all right with just my kids and my wife 
 One night alone with no fights, with Kim just huggin' me tight 
 Miss Perfect
