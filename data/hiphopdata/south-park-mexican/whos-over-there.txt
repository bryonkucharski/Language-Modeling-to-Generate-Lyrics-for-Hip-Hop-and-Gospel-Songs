(SPM) 
 Yeah, I just wanna say that I love all you haters, 
 It's not your fault, you was raised to like the smell of shit 
 Us playas would like to smell the roses. 
 Chorus (Marilyn Rylander): 
 Who's over there? 
 No one said that life was fair 
 You haters come from everywhere 
 Y'all haters just because you're scared 
 First Verse (SPM): 
 Broken dreams, to be the coke King, 
 Everyone is sleep except me and the dopefiends 
 Five A.M. sittin' on the corner, 
 The day's gettin' warmer but my heart is gettin' colder 
 Sold my last boulder let the storm pass over, 
 Never touch my dope, I'm only the cash holder 
 Soldier, I sleep with one eye open, 
 In the land where you see men die smokin' 
 Let the fry soak in, water, water, 
 Hillwood cowboy, fuckin' down the farmer's daughter 
 Street saga, corner store robber, 
 Like Pasell I take your gal a la cama, 
 Baller, my block hotter than lava, 
 The wetback, in love with my mujada, 
 Papa, shit talker, they drop-uh 
 SPM, the rap Skyywalker 
 (Second Verse (Low-G)) 
 Which road will I travel? 
 White sand or hard gravel? 
 Fuck a friend, I don't even trust my own shadow, 
 I'm in a battle with the dirtiest of enemies, 
 'Cause I'm chippin' dope, all across the seven seas, 
 Low-G and the wheeze of the Vo-C, 
 At the ranch where my weed plants grow free 
 December 9, a child was born with no heart, 
 Since a kid, they said I wouldn't go far 
 Ghetto scars tryin' to keep away from Merro bars 
 The rudest hours, FUCK Escobar, 
 Entity of drodas, I roll with top soldiers 
 If they approach us, I bury those cockroaches 
 Third Verse (SPM): 
 I ain't start from the bottom, I dug myself out a hole 
 Grabbed a pen, and taught myself how to flow 
 Now my snow crystal, my shit primo, 
 Toe taggin' haters with a tiny torpedo 
 Desillo, me and my nuts make a good trio, 
 I'm the nigga pissin' in my cup for my P.O. 
 Life hit me like a double shot of whiskey, 
 In every song I give a piece of my history 
 This be reality, they wanna battle me, 
 But that'll be the day, gather up my family 
 Packin' heat, pick 'em up like a sack of meat 
 Most my niggas dead, or walkin' round with shackled feet 
 We had to eat, you can ask these cops, 
 I bought my first hooptie with fifteen rocks 
 They smoked non-stop, I watched as the crack melted, 
 I comes real 'cause I really can't help it 
 (SPM) 
 Yeah this one goes out to all my players 
 Don't let them haters get you down man 
 Besides, anybody who lets a hater get 'em down, 
 Ten times out of ten is a hater, I ain't trippin' 
 We comin' down baby 2000. It's like that baby
