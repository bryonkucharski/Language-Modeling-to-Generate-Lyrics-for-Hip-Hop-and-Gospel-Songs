Yeppa Yeppa homeboys 
 That's the nigga Low-G 
 Puttin' it down for the nina eight 
 We givin' prop, what we did this week 
 So don't trip, if we forgot your click 
 I move a hundred pounds in my hustle town 
 Come around fuck 'em down with my underground 
 Puffin' pow-wow clouds in my T.P. 
 But my hina' hollerin' release me 
 Prime time like shines on the high mimes 
 Hellafied rhymes, huh, you rewind twenty-five times 
 Another fool puttin' down the truth 
 You can't fuck with the riddla' on the roof 
 Mista', go get her, kick the mo' better 
 If she want to go, fuck the ho, let her 
 The wanderer, hill wood hustler 
 Turn your back on your gail and I, uh, straight clown in my H-town 
 Is you hoes really ready for the take down? 
 Break down, stay ground, my niggas don't play round, pop pop 
 Make your whole click catch the Greyhound 
 Geto Boys, Master P, DJ Screw, Kid Frost, Mobb Deep 
 Ese Fools, Ice-T, Fat Pat, Public Enemy 
 We, put the streets on beats 
 Makaveli, Rakim, Hillwood Hustlers, Most Hated 
 Too $hort, Bone Thugs, Dogg Pound, Nas, The Fugees 
 We, put the streets on beats 
 Stick & move, hittin' lics, sweep 'em left to right 
 Act a fool when I one two check the mic 
 Come trip with the pimp in the smoke-ray lac 
 I jump in this shit and there's no way back 
 Creep the seven seven Seville convertible 
 My Cadillac got a 3-foot verticle jump in the front 
 Bump in the trunk, weed turn to smoke, skunk in my blunt 
 I'm the cool homeboy, I'm a fool with no patience 
 Got a dopehouse in seven locations 
 Professional, but don't test my testicles 
 On the pedestal I'm colder than an eskimo 
 Gotta have it, causing panic with an automatic 
 And leaving myself, no one else saw my magic 
 Gifted child, raised in the wicked wild 
 Put the street on beats, who trippin' now? 
 Run DMC, KRS-One, Mass 187, Spice 1

 DJ Quik, Big Fifty Snipe, Criminal Rage 
 20-2-Life, N.W.A., Lil' Kim, Rasheed 
 We, put the streets on beats 
 I be the actual, factual, rap supernatural, blowin' up national 
 It's understandable, not to mention 
 What I'm stressin' leave you second guessin' 
 Dope sell itself, saw my CD steady pressin' 
 It can't see me, I flow so freely, you motherfuckers more slimier than seaweed 
 Jus' to pee-wee, son you watchin' too much TV, I'm on CD 
 See mo' pussy-cat than tweety! 
 On the underground nation, layin' foundation 
 The biggest problem that H-Town's facin' 
 Did a lot of wrong, but mom, stay calm, cause now I drop bombs on CD-Roms 
 Your raps get pimpslapped, you kickin' bubblegum 
 Only real niggas know where I'm comin' from, under confusion 
 Run up on Houston, and bow down to the styles I am usin'
