Yeah yeah. 
 Jeney. 
 South Park Mexican: 
 Another deadly ceremony 
 In a sacred territory 
 It was all done for the glory 
 You bitches ain't got nothin' for me 
 O G from the H I double L W double O D 
 Live the life of the lowly 
 Movin' white ponies, still puttin' in work for the dead homies 
 Show me your way out, stayin' ready for anything under the sun 
 Under the moon, under the stars, God I'm lookin' for somewhere to run 
 Dumpin' my gun, as soon as I'm done 
 Leavin' 'em numb with one in his lung 
 Livin' fast and dyin' young, always business never for fun. 
 Tell me what it is. 
 Tell me what you want. 
 For your 3rd Wish. 
 This is your last wish. 
 Tell me what it is. 
 Tell me what you need. 
 For your 3rd Wish. 
 This is your last wish. 
 South Park Mexican: 
 Bustin' our teflon, at the red dawn 
 I ain't fuckin' with nothin' get stepped on 
 The purest, I'm the surest, playin' a tourist walkin' through Saigon 
 Been a hustla' servin' up big bricks 
 And livin' my life to hit licks 
 Trip on a G like me and see them beads of banana clips Trick 
 Stamina cannot be duplicated 
 Bite on the dust, you get faded 
 So many wannabe criminals up in the game of the drug related 
 Open up, open up new Dope Houses 
 Turnin' you men into mouses 
 Saggin' my burgendy trousers 
 Just Lettin' you know how the South is. 
 Tell me what it is. 
 Tell me what you want. 
 For your 3rd Wish. 
 This is your last wish. 
 Tell me what it is. 
 Tell me what you need. 
 For your 3rd Wish. 
 This is your last wish.

 [South Park Mexican:] "All right my nigga. Are you sure about Lil' Drugs?" 
 [Grimm:] "I'm sure man, he's gone baby, he's gone. We gotta get these muthafuckers." 
 [South Park Mexican:] "All right, hurry up." 
 End's phone conversation, South Park Mexican starts talkin' to himself: 
 [South Park Mexican:] "Okay, this is it, I've wished for money & I've wished for fame, but what good is it, if I'm still stuck in this game? So, for my 3rd Wish... 
 I just wish for all this shit to stop. Just please make it stop." 
 South Park Mexican: 
 I'm back once again for revenge 
 In an all-black bulletproof Benz. 
 How will I get 'em? It just depends 
 Hook his ass up with all his dead friends 
 Here ye' here ye' sincerely. 
 Why so many haters fear me? 
 Dearly departed, y'all started some shit and struck but couldn't come near me 
 We're the odyssey, young prodigy, runnin' the top notch properties 
 Where snitches get shot in they arteries, but gettin' nobody's apologies 
 Follow me. How do we master the first jack? 
 Since the day I was born I was cursed Black 
 H-Town's where I'm doin' my dirt at 
 Robbin' you hoes on horseback. All that! 
 Tell me what it is. 
 Tell me what you want. 
 For your 3rd Wish. 
 This is your last wish. 
 Tell me what it is. 
 Tell me what you need. 
 For your 3rd Wish. 
 This is your last wish.
