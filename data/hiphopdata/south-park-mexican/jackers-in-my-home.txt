They wipe tears while I wipe fingerprints off led. 
 They say shoot for the stars, I say shoot for the head. 
 I believe in good times havin' peace and fun. 
 But I'm still in my room tryin' to grease my gun. 
 Can't let it get rusty, if a shoot out breaks. 
 The only thing I want jammin' is my screwed out tape. 
 And tomorrow's the big day gotta get my rest. 
 45 G's out of town, lick buyin' tres. 
 I'm all alone, my girl said that she couldn't make it. 
 'Cause she caught a damn cold and her whole body's achin'. 
 And I feel kind of nervous, butterfly's in my stomach. 
 But I drift off to sleep, really thinkin' nothin' of it. 
 Then somethin' wakes me up & I open my eyes. 
 Somebody's in my house, I'm heartbroken 
 'Cause I couldn't tell my Mom "Bye" they finally caught me slippin' 
 I'm a die like a man homeboy I ain't trippin'. 
 Gun shots to my dome, Jackers In My Home 
 Nothin' to fancy, just your average tombstone 
 I'm sorry that I chose the life under the curse 
 I'll be dressed in a suit and finally goin' to church.

 Dreams of the cream, enemies on different teams. 
 Red beans in my house man this shit is so extreme. 
 I saw 'em' dressed up in all black wit the mask. 
 And I knew they was comin' for the birds and the cash. 
 So I rolled out my bed, hit the floor and start crawlin' 
 And this is the price that you pay when your ballin'. 
 But how did they get the spare key to my crib? 
 It had to be my bitch, he gon' die if I live! 
 Usually I keep a black glock on my dresser. 
 And I'm hearin' someone whisperin' sayin' "Los's I'm a getcha!" 
 And I'm knowin' it's the devil but I pay it no mind. 
 I been dodgin' that fool ever since I was 9. 
 Gotta make it to the closet, where I keep my Mossberg. 
 Slug shots, one hit, never speak another word. 
 Little did I know they had night vision goggles. 
 When they saw me on the floor boy squeezed on the throttle.

 Shots started rangin' I was tumblin' and divin'. 
 Runnin' out of time, with my mind on survivin'. 
 Dove out the window but I started seein' stars 
 I forgot last week 'bout some burglar bars. 
 Now my face is all wet & I know it ain't sweat. 
 Bullet hit my leg so I rolled to the left. 
 Guess where I was at? Damn right, in the closet! 
 Grabbed a pump, now it's my turn to make a deposit. 
 Damn slugs ain't no punk hit the boy in his back 
 Saw his right leg flyin' and it knocked down my lamp. 
 Unloaded, reloaded, was a 3 man army. 
 Now they lookin' like pitas at the end of a party. 
 One was still alive so I start askin' questions. 
 He could barely talk, spitin' blood like venom. 
 He said he had a team and that people would rent him. 
 I kill the messegers now I need who sent em'.
