 2nd Verse *South Park Mexican): 
 Well I like the Thug Girl with the big brown eyes 
 SPM baby on the rise 
 She got rashache & a big gold chain 
 Drivin' outta state with my cocaine 
 She know how to roll big fat sweets 
 Holla nigga you can smoke if you match me 
 Shoot big dice 
 Jam spice crew eat food with the hands and drink guys rule 
 I do it for you 'cause you care about me 
 When I was locked down in Harris county 
 Puttin' money on my books for my comercery 
 All my broke homies at home watchin' Jerry 
 I Told her I was very hooked on Miss Mary 
 She said she had a boyfriend that she wanted me to bury 
 From there we hit it off & I must admit 
 Thug Girl your thuggin' & I'm lovin' it.

 Well I'm that Thug that you can't resist 
 Crazy ass bitch I was made for this 
 Got a house full of dope 
 Million dollar click nena ross givin' birth to 17 kids. 
 Can you fit when you get extra clip on my hip? 
 Holla tits let it zip all through your shit 
 If you pass the cemetery on main and 5th 
 You can see a collection of my greatest hits 
 Havin' zipped ondrary under contrary 
 If y'all feel me then holla already 
 Some of you broads become old news 
 Gettin' tagged team and wrecked up by who knows who. 
 Well rule #1 you wanna touch for fun you get touched by gun. 
 Until you fuck with son huh?

 'Cause when the sun goes down it's a muthafuckin' jungle.
