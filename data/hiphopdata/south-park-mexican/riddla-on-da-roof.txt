(Chorus: Robin) 
 He's a riddla aaaaaaaa 
 The muthafuckin riddla aaaaaaaa 
 (Verse 1: SPM 
 Silently 
 I receive my degree 
 I got my masters in dope fiend psychiatry 
 Like the weed my brain buzzin like a bee 
 Flyin free I only fear sobriety 
 Shy police 
 Invading my privacy 
 We set a lot in court 
 They accepted my bribery 
 Finally I let this irony inspire me 
 They dying silently 
 Really jus tryin' to be 
 Society denying me 
 So my pro-bity 
 Is flippin ghetto ivory 
 Oh my dear diary 
 My hood is fiery 
 They admire me 
 Will I die a G or will I build a fukin dynasty 
 (Chorus: Robin) 
 Repeat 4x 
 (Bridge: Rasheed) 
 It's the riddla on the roof 
 Rose from the bottom came to speak the truth 
 It's the riddla on the roof 
 An eye for an eye 
 A tooth for a tooth 
 Repeat 2x 
 (Rasheed talking) 
 Yeah that's right it's ya boy Rasheed 
 All the way from the North Philadelphia ghettos 
 To the South Park slums 
 Representin in that Dope House with my man 
 The South Park Mexican 
 Say Los break these boys off once again 
 (Verse 2: SPM) 
 It's that vato 
 Convo you know how the song go 
 Get my freak on so 
 Watch for Santo 
 Pronto 
 Like a bronco 
 Turn him to a John Doe 
 I make ya body need bondo 
 I stomp hoes 
 Pop pop those hallows 
 A hard act to follow 
 A fool named Carlos 
 Ya know my matto 
 "Don't act like a star bro" 
 If ya talk don't pay ya damn car note 
 And although it's almost tomorrow 
 Cept for sorrow 
 Cause don't be a rap they can borrow 
 I swallow a ballo 
 Back at me lago 
 And G's hollerin bravo 
 Getting smoked like a Marlbro 
 (Chorus: Robin) 
 Repeat 4x 
 (Bridge: Rasheed) 
 Repeat 2x 
 (Verse 3: SPM) 
 Ain't no sympathy in the street 
 It's either him or me 
 Officially he the man that can get with me 
 Nigga please 
 My trigga squeeze come like the killer bees 
 Figure these the last days why stick wit G's 
 Initially my millimi make 'em history 
 Clinically approved to kill that ass instanly 
 Spill the beans and get in between my guillotine 
 Bitches fiend for my dope like nicotine 
 Sippin lean ya started with the triple beam 
 Competion tell me 
 Are you listening? 
 It's the king 
 Livin' life like Pistol Pete 
 With me so heat 
 That'll make yo body incomplete 
 Epidemy of a mental facility 
 I take ya nuts and hang 'em on my Christmas tree 
 Simpily I don't slip but I'm slippery 
 Unseen like the n-tity 
 Really be sick of beef 
 I disagree wit ya trickery 
 Blast like Yosemite 
 Smoke ya ass like a hickory 
 Industry 
 Ya fixin to see my embassy 
 Critically acclaimed forever yo mystery 
 (Chorus: Robin) 
 Repeat 4x 
 (Bridge: Rasheed) 
 Repeat 2x 
 (Rasheed) 
 A tooth for a tooth 
 A tooth for a tooth 
 (Robin)
