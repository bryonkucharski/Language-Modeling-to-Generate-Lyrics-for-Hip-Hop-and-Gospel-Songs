[SPM:] Man I don't like the way I did that, Filero. Look, rewind it and uh... rewind the music, let me try to do it one more time. 
 Drums sound: 
 Phone ringing: 
 [SPM:] Damn! My-my phone. Hold... Hold on, Filero, let me answer this phone. Dope House Records. 
 [Jazzmine over phone:] Is Juan Gotti there? 
 [SPM:] Um, nah, baby. Your calling my cell phone, you need to call him on his cell phone. 
 [Jazzmine over phone:] Oh, I didn't know he had a phone. What's his number? 
 [SPM:] Well, f... uh, you have to buy him a phone first and then you'll know the number. All right? 
 [Jazzmine over phone:] Oh, that's fucked-up.
