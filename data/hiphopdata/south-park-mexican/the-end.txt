South Park Mexican: 
 Yo, this SPM, man. 
 This The End of my album. 
 I want to tell everyone that got love for us, I want to say thanks. 
 Thanks for buyin' this album. 
 And thanks for jammin' my shit. 
 We got love for you players, man. 
 I don't care what side you from, what set you from, what color you claim. 
 All I ask is that you don't curse the innocent children. 
 'Cause they deserve to be happy. 
 Dope House Family. 
 My boy Rasheed, Low-G, Happy Perez, Juan Gotti, Coast, Quarter Ki, DFO, Pete and Red Bird, Tragedy, Sham, homie Marco, my sister Sylvia, Omar, Jose and Sisco. 
 Look out for my Screwston CD's. 
 If it ain't screwed up it ain't 'bout shit. 
 What up, little papa? Dumb-dumb droppin' an album. 
 Russell Lee and Maximum Melly. 
 [Juan Gotti:] Hey Los, what's up, man? Can I say somethin' too my raza?

 [Juan Gotti:] Check this out. It's your boy Juan Gotti representin' for my raza, matienez, we doin' this, watch out for my album comin' out "No Sett Trippin'" We puttin' this down, matienez. 
 South Park Mexican: 
 For real. Watch out for that Juan Gotti, you know, his album comin' out while She-Low workin' on a new album. Low-G I mean. 
 You know, we Dope House man, it ain't gon' quit. Diamond rings and fancy whiz ain't real happyness. Your diamonds and your jewels are your friends and your family, remember that. 
 I love y'all & I'm out.
