(SPM:) 
 Now spread the word 
 I got them bricks on the dead end streets 
 And watch them jump out boys 
 'Cause they rollin' ten deep 
 Creep crawlin the night 
 Ya know the deal 
 In the muthafuckin Hill 
 We all strapped to kill 
 Chill hittin licks in the wind that never ceases 
 Mad 'cause they askin me for three dollar pieces 
 How the fuck I'm suppoesed to come up 
 Of a shy move 
 Run up on a twenty and get yo ass an ice cube 
 It ain't nothin' why you bumpin in yo Cutlass 
 Jus understand the roughness 
 Never cut for the gutless 
 'Cause it's do or die 
 You ask 
 Who am I? 
 I was a heartbreaker ever since junior high 
 Eye of the public 
 The Brown be a suspect 
 So the streets taught me to be loveless 
 Causin rawkus 
 In a dope fiends bucket 
 My two favorite subjects were 
 Shut it and fuck it 
 (Coro: SPM) 
 The night shift 
 Young hustlers workin grave yards 
 The night shift 
 Street soldiers workin grave yards 
 My nine be 
 Beside me 
 Tonight we 
 Work the night shift 
 My nine be 
 Beside me 
 Tonight we 
 Work the night shift 
 (Verse 2: Pimpstress) 
 It's yo midnight mistress 
 Playa named Pimpstress 
 I keep it crunk handle up on my business 
 Queen of the click 
 Fiend for my shit 
 I'm sucked and corrupt 
 Sixteen in my click 
 From black and mop 
 You can't crack my style 
 Playa hatin' bitches make me crack a smile 
 Tonight 
 We whoride 
 In the moonlight 
 My feria ruka sound like the fuckin' chula 
 Fools die 
 Fuckin' wit my feria 
 Daddy streaks wanna marry ya 
 Then bury ya 
 Nina Ross, Mary Jane, Ms. Cocaine 
 The three devils thought us deep in the dope game 
 So strange 
 True G's won't change 
 Close range 
 Left ya boys wit no brains 
 Street zombies 
 Takin' out posses 
 Dangerous hobbies 
 Jus call me 
 (Coro: SPM) (x2) 
 (SPM:) 
 Alone in my home 
 Cock my gats 
 I'm known for my dope so I watch for jacks 
 Keep out burglar 
 Come on in 
 Bring all yo men let the games begin 
 Pumpin 'em in the cheek man I 
 Hot shots comin' out my banana 
 Got plans like Santa Anna 
 Got balls like Tony Montana 
 Trick or treat 
 Feel my heat 
 Hear my muthafuckin drum beats 
 Don't believe the tales from my hood? 
 Come see 
 This ain't no joke you can smoke 
 This ain't no wonderland 
 I kick this shit so you motherfuckers understand 
 I pop mine 
 With a glock nine 
 Blow that head off a muthafuckin stop sign 
 Be the one never 
 You come I come better 
 Bring yo umbrella 
 I bring the rough weather 
 Pleasure one pleasure 
 Choppin up chedder 
 Ya whole crew get done by one fella
