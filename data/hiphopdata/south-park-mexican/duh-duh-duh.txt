(SPM) 
 Fo sho 
 Ugh 
 (1st Verse) 
 It was me, Low G, and a couple of hoes 
 That we picked up in 2nd Ward on Avenue O 
 They want a cold cooler and a nick' sack of budda 
 I'm already high, 
 Lost in the Bermuda 
 I got my six shooter 
 Watch for the hoota 
 I'm quick on attack, just like the baracuda 
 Got a belly like a buddah 
 The pussy intruder 
 The "S" on my chest stands for Super Dee Duper 
 'Cause I'm a basketball hooper 
 Out-run the trooper 
 I'ma bring home the trophy like Cynthia Cooper 
 Cucaracha in my ashtray 
 A 40 on my lap 
 I sell crack to the Blacks, whites, Mexicans and jacks 
 Slap hoes like a pimp 
 I spit like a snake 
 Get my cash with a rake 
 Break a hoe like a date 
 So, make no mistake 
 I bake cookies and cakes 
 In the Benz, 
 "SPM" on my lisence plates 
 Duh Duuuuuh, Duh Duh Duh Duh Duuh 
 Duh Duh Duh Duh Duuuuuh 
 Duh Duh Duh Duh Duuh 
 Duh Duh Duh Duh Duuuuuh 
 Duh Duh Duh Duh Duuh 
 Duh Duh Duh Duh Duuuuuh 
 Duh Duh Duh Duh Duuh 
 (2nd Verse) 
 I smile on camera like "Abracadabra" 
 And I fuck a bitch down like a took some Viagra 
 I'm a stabber, I'm a sticker. No soda with my liquor 
 I'm the quicker picker-upper, grab a slut and go trick her 
 Dick her down, slap her up, if she a stuck up tramp 
 Never run from no one 'cause I might catch a cramp 
 Got niggas that kill for a five dollar bill 
 Snitches and pigs love each other 'cause they both squeal 
 I'm the greasiest, grimiest, grusomist 
 As a kid they would say I was use-less 
 I chunk a duece and keep creepin' on my ten-speed 
 My heart was empty, but now I fuck 'em gently 
 In the Bently, niggas can't believe this 
 But for everything, I gots to thank Jesus 
 Blessin' me with extraordinary skills 
 Now every time I rap you mutherfuckers get the chills 
 (3rd Verse) 
 Platinum necklace 
 Dope game specialist 
 I get my dick sucked by my new receptionist 
 Wetback for President 
 Fuck an impressionist 
 Bitches cuss me out when I check my messeges 
 Dangerous family, bust cap like salary 
 Niggas try to swing for assault and battery 
 Musicly 
 I try to bring about unity 
 It's about you and me, 
 Strengthen the community 
 Usually, 
 I blow, act stupidly 
 Niggas wanna shoot at me, 
 That shit ain't blue to me 
 Fluently, 
 I be surrounded my jealousy 
 But I kill the fuckin' players and the referee 
 I got jewels and gems 
 2000 Benz 
 People can't believe we some Mexicans 
 And if you hate, check me out Lo 
 If my name's in your mouth then my dick's down your throat
