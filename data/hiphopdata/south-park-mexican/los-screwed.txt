<Los> 
 I was raised on Red Beams and Rice 
 And if you shot up my crib I wouldn't be surprised 
 Mama used to trip 'cause I fed the mice 
 I'm the one they sent home 'cause my head had lice 
 I'm the kid that lost my sanity 
 I'm the kid that had the toys with no batteries 
 Mama sat me down for some serious talks 
 On how to keep the rats out the cereal box. 
 <Los> 
 I'm a smoke till I croak nigga fuck bein' broke nigga 
 I need 7 bedrooms and my boat nigga 
 Watchin' rats with 87 new gats 
 The penitentary's the only place where I can relax 
 I want some hoes in they heads they pushin' me to the edge 
 The only thing I'm a miss is my beautiful kids 
 I'm just sippin' pedron I handle shit on my own 
 I got a camera for every fuckin' inch of my home 
 It's in my blood to be a drunk and not give a fuck 
 I do a drive by in my grandma's truck 
 A G since daddy left me at the age of 3 
 Now every South Side crackhead pagin' me. 
 <Los> 
 Muthafuck you nigga stop teachin' 'n'shit 
 I grab my muthafuckin' glock and start squeezin' my shit 
 No mercy for the weak bitch so save yo' speech bitch 
 You can't reach I'm too deep in these streets bitch 
 Don't piss me off I'll put this gat to yo' head. 
 Can't you see these jealous bitches pray for us to be dead? 
 You gettin' soft now? You must wanna die too 
 All it takes is one bullet to kill me and you. 
 (Gunshot:)
