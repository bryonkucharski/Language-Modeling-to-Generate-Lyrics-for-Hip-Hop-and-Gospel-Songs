First Verse: 
 My homie called me in the morning from a hospital bed 
 He got holes in his body from a glock full of lead 
 He said, three motherfuckers that his lady knows 
 Tried to jack his ass for his 84's 
 Now in a Ben Taub sick bed, my homie lays up 
 He got sprayed up, 'cause he wouldn't raise 
 Caught three of the seven of the shots that rang 
 Them folks sayin' that he'd never walk the same 
 It sounds like a job for the uzi gat 
 And where the fuck did your bitch say these fools be at? 
 For a real long time, we been the best of friends 
 And I'll be damned if a nigga don't get revenge 
 I feel anger, that I'm no stranger to 
 Bustin' slugs in they guts just a thang to do 
 Why they pray for you, come and spray they crew 
 Got love for my homies, I thought you knew? 
 He said "Los don't sweat it, let this shit alone," 
 But with these punk motherfuckers I must pick a bone 
 Now will it be the cranium or the chest plate? 
 Necks break back, snap, put him in checkmate 
 Lead take me to vengeance, send this 
 Ripping through tendons I end this 
 Because you bleed inside and it hurts to cough 
 I can't take no advice I gots to break them off 
 'Cause my revenge, it tastes so sweet, I gotta do, 
 What my friends, would do for me, 
 You muthafuckas gotta beg, 
 Y'all askin' for action, 
 Eat a fuckin' K, 
 I'm blastin' some asses 
 'Cause my revenge, it tastes so sweet, I gotta do, 
 What my friends, would do for me, 
 You muthafuckas gotta beg, 
 Y'all askin' for action, 
 Eat a fuckin' K, 
 I'm blastin' some asses 
 Second Verse: 
 My niggas check me, I'm thinkin' of a master plan 
 I'm straight up blastin' glocks, them fuckin' bastards ran 
 I'm steady missin' all my homies that done bit the dust 
 Got revenge 'cause them bitches wasn't shit to us 
 Now what the fuck can I accomplish? 
 And when I'm dead, will I find myself on God's list? 
 Every night I give, thanks I wouldn't die today 
 Turnin' cane into crack and my mic away 
 We dealin' 'cause we feelin' that the, pay's right 
 Hopin' Mama never see me at my, grave site 
 No daylight, play night cautiously 
 Could be death, or my freedom what it's costin' me 
 Lost in dear life my wife be that Mary Jane 
 And my streets got me strollin' blueberry Lane 
 Very same song sung in the South 
 From the mouth of a hustler, never have I trusted a 
 Trick or a hoe or a dope fiend either 
 'Cause they smoke like a beaver buildin' dams on the river 
 Live a, life of a "G' till the d - a - y 
 Hittin' switches on the freeway high 
 Don't reply 'cause me don't give a fuck 
 What you hoes got to say about me Hillwood funk 
 Third Verse: 
 Stop short in your tracks 
 Gats got the place surrounded 
 Sounded two warning shots, fuck on up and you'll be grounded 
 Pounded bodies with a bunch of twelve gauges 
 Now her face is too straight in the fuckin' dog cages 
 Pages of my book, turn like the wind blows 
 On the paper of a crook, muthafuck them hoes 
 Hittin' flows as a hustler, rose as a "G" 
 Saves his flows to big 8, now he scores half a ki 
 Some say in his head he got insanity inside 
 But all it really be is mathematically inclined 
 Look behind, you might find others takin' over 
 Rookies movin' cookies, they whipped in baking soda 
 Baby learn the fuckin' rules, my cheese, is SOLID AS A ROCK 
 With my homies and we BALLIN' WITH A GLOCK 
 Tenderoni phony fraud motherfuckers 
 Best to get out the game, 'fore you die motherfuckers 
 Bustas trust us, but us hustlas trust no one 
 You can sure run with no gun 
 That be a nigga slow guns 
 So roll one of them sweets 
 Chug-a-lug on the eightball 
 And see where this motherfuckin life is gonna take y'all 
 And haters might fall
