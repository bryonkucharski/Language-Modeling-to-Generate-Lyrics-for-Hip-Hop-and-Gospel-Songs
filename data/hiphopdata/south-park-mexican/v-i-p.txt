South Park Mexican: 
 V.I.P. baby 
 Uh 
 The room's kinda foggy, ballin' is a hobby 
 She said I like your style, I told her it was doggy 
 More champagne and more white wine 
 She had a gold chain that looked just like mine 
 Now you might find my life hard to believe 
 I hop in my Jeep and holla talkin' is cheap. 
 Where my keys homeboy? I snatch 'em from the Valet 
 It's pourin' down rain, Rollin' down South Main 
 2:16 when I hit the scene, Pull up at After Hours 'about to live my dream 
 I got the Infra beam wit a 1/5 of Lean, gave the password & a fist of green 
 Now chiggycheck 1, 2, this one's for you 
 V.I.P. D.J. jammin' ??? Screw 
 Surrounded by nudity and private security 
 My game like cain son, you can taste the purity. 
 It's a private party, at the V.I.P. 
 How many players wanna be like me? 
 Drinks on the house, put it on my tab 
 We 3 young players just actin' bad 
 In the GS Lex, or the SF6 
 Order ??? & some Thai while I'm hittin' my licks 
 So just pass the Kill and pop the Dom 
 At the V.I.P. baby, once again it's on. 
 Say where my players at? Where my players at? 
 Uh sippin' on year wit the gangsta hat uh 
 Blowin' on trees Puffin' on a fat uh 
 Player made paper now it's on like that 
 Lookin' at my Cartier, I thinks it's time 
 Platinum strapped to my wrist, Diamonds 'about to make me go blind 
 When I step throught the door better watch yo' girl 'fore I make that hoe mine 
 I've been a Mack since way back, my Zodiac the Doller Sign 
 In time, you'll find me too clever, however 
 Give me a hard headed broad, I'll change her like the weather 
 Give me a broke legged frog, I'll make it jump forever 
 Give me some crack and some bars & I'll make plenty cheddar 
 Pimpin' ain't easy, but somebody's gotta do it 
 Conversation ain't nothin' lest your willin' to pursue it 
 If you gon' do it, you better stay true to it 
 Man pimpin' ain't dead, you just new to it. 
 It's a private party, at the V.I.P.

 Pancho Villa: 
 Girl we're V.I.P. Very Important People 
 Mr. Pancho V & Tommy G 
 With yo' mami's all up under me 
 So we slidin' in the Beamer or the GS3 
 Highly scouted pro player, Never been a hater 
 Congratulater, Don't get mad when I take her 
 And break her, to the woman that you could not make her 
 Known for pullin' top notch models, Sex with all the gatos 
 Well paid vatos, Never had the same O's 
 Always down to share hoes and after the club 
 I'm in the Tahoe, where all the girl's follow. 
 All y'all look good, which one of y'all gon' swallow? 
 Gucci on my eyes, diamantes on my teeth 
 Dimples in my cheeks, Hydroponic in my leaf 
 Lookin' hella good like every player should 
 Paper come from wood, but I come from hood. 
 Chorus and out 
 It's a private party, at the V.I.P. 
 How many players wanna be like me? 
 Drinks on the house, put it on my tab 
 We 3 young players just actin' bad 
 In the GS Lex, or the SF6 
 Order ??? & some Thai while I'm hittin' my licks 
 So just pass the Kill and pop the Dom 
 At the V.I.P. baby, once again it's on.
