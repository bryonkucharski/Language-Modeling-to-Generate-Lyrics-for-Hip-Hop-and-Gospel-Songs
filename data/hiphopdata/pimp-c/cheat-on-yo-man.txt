 (Mannie Fresh) 
 If you wanna get ahead baby, 
 Stick to the plan, if you wanna get ahead baby, cheat on yo man, 
 If you wanna get ahead baby, 
 Stick to the plan, if you wanna get ahead, hey, I'll show you 
 (Pimp C) 
 I ain't really tryin' to break you and yo nigga up, I'm just tryin' to get paid and put some dick up in yo butt, I'm glad you got a man you can givin' me drama, you could be his maid and yet pimp his momma, I've seen ya on Fandrin, grippin in a Honda, I was in a big toy goin' to a conference, I still put it on the edge like John Vito, choppin blaze on da edge lik dat boy C-Note, you can choose or get down with some true shit, or snooze and loose instead of out there payin' due's, bitch, and nigga need to take you to exotic, gold hollow in it 'cause girl your wrist lookin' solid, cluster-rings ain't what its about, but he got twenty-thousand dollors worth of diamonds in his mouth, his truck on 24's, in yo car ridin' daddy, if you're breakin' fo his safe then bring dat shit over to Jazze, 
 (Suga) 
 Now I don't really care what you talkin' about, unless you're talkin' 'bout me, put a cat in your mouth, I'm sick of you niggas thinkin' yo ass is hot, when you livin' off ya broad thinkin' is all ya got, so bitch get a trick wit a wedding rang, keep it 100, his ass will get ya everythang, but don't change at the crib, stay the same way, gave it to him like yo ass bey'once, stacked in snacks, until ya next nigga upgrade, stay paid, and keep away from the bitch maid, make sure you never let a good man down, keep him up, keep it up and he'll stay around, so when ya out wit ya man and and he roll up, turn to him, twink dat eye and twick dat ass up, so when ya out wit ya man and and he roll up, turn to him, wink dat eye and twick dat ass up, 
 3rd Verse: 
 (Mannie Fresh) 
 Love ain't nothin' but a four letter word, got your girl doin' tricks and a thunder bird, cart-wheel, how the deal, lyin' dead on the thang, and she so turned on by this big-ass rang, still make alotta money with the medeocher skillz, push a old school chevy with some big-ass wheels, if you know better, show better, give her the winner, your man ain't nothin' but a luxury dinner, ya be fucked up, and ya rent ain't paid, all ya bills behind, and ya sex life dead, ya dude so straight, you a big-ass dream, pack ya shit young lady and be a part of my team, what you know about slidin on barre with flows, I can fix from the hair, to the nails, to the toes, we can get together, sit together, kick it and shit, that's alll you gotta do is let a real nigga hit, 
 Chorus: (Repeat 4x)
