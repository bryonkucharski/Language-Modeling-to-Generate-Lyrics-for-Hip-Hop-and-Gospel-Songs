Smoke somethin', bitch 
 U-G-K, hold up, talkin' bout, uh 
 Pimp C P.A. Trill nigga 
 Polo fuck that Hilfiger 
 Made myself a ghetto star 
 On the slab, sippin' barre 
 Smokin' weed, sellin' white 
 Them other niggas shit don't come back right 
 That's how niggas get popped 
 Trying to get the cheaper price 
 Watch yo' paper, guard your life 
 Cause most these niggaz ain't livin' right 
 Keep yo' pistol, fuck a fight 
 Cause niggas out here jack every night 
 I keep my mind on my money nigga fuck the fame 
 Big face hun'erds, keepin' the game 
 Hittin' the corner in the candy thang 
 Sittin' on leather, grippin' the grain 
 Good weed, good drink, big money, we (Aye!) 
 Rollin' in somethin' foreign, on leather grippin' grain (yeah!) 
 I handle my business so I think I deserve to get throwed, throwed 
 Well I came in the door, I said it befo' 
 I never fuck a hoe without head no more 
 I never pull up in nothin' less than a four 
 And I smoke cigars, it ain't just for the show 
 I'm blessed from the do', and known for my stidile 
 I send a nigga baby mamma home with a smidile 
 You can have the bitch nigga, I ain't sentimental 
 Smoke weed and freestyle, no instrumental 
 Been out, lived through the wicked streets of P.A. 
 Motherfuck the judge, prosecutor and the DA 
 Head to the H, where the hoes will fuck three way 
 Two way, four way, anyway the Pro say 
 Never hear a hoe say no I won't, no I can't 
 Stop it and no I don't 
 Cause a bitch know that I might just explode 
 And slap her in the face with a pie a la mode 
 Cause a nigga gettin' throwed 
 You already know what it is, nigga 
 Snowman, 16 5 a piece, nigga U-S-D-A 
 I grind hard (grind hard) and play harder (play harder) 
 Break out the pot (yup) heat up the water (damn!) 
 Swear to God the minivan do tricks 
 Hit the brakes, hit the lights and wow, there go them bricks 
 Slide through the hood (Hood!) sittin' on some big wheels 
 Niggaz coppin white and turn flips like cartwheels 
 Trapstar, my NexTel chirp all day (Aye!) 
 Ridin' dirty, three nines and a four way (yeah!) 
 Big money, man we only ride the best 
 This one and only, big homey 
 Tried to told you I'm thug, ha 
 So far I'm tourin on foreign land 
 Worldwide I'm known for the Arm and Hamm' 
 Er, Murder the streets I'm a wanted man 
 (But the flow's like dope) So it's on again 
 Started with the block, hit it brick by brick 
 Then I charted with the ROC nigga, hit by hit 
 I'm retarded with the glock nigga, clip by clip 
 The competition is none, they deceased to exist 
 Let it breathe a little bit 
 He's off his rocker, he's a lil schitz' 
 Roll like a football, Hov' used to cook raw 
 Now I got the game sewn like granny's good shawl 
 Sure, y'all niggas want war 
 Y'all got it backwards, y'all should want raw 
 Y'all should want more (and more, and more uh!)
