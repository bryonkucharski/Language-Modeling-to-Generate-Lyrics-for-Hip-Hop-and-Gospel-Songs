I keep my cup raised up my nigga 'cause I'm a playa 
 Nigga 'cause I'm a playa, nigga 'cause I'm a playa 
 My dollars stay stackin' and nigga 'cause I'll be mackin' 
 Nigga 'cause I'll be mackin', nigga 'cause I'll be mackin' 
 I keep my cup raised up my nigga 'cause I'm a playa 
 Nigga 'cause I'm a playa, nigga 'cause I'm a playa 
 My dollars stay stackin' and nigga 'cause I'll be mackin' 
 Nigga 'cause I'll be mackin', nigga 'cause I'll be mackin' 
 I'm just out here slangin' CDs nigga like rock for rockers 
 Still rollin' hypnotize, we quick to knock off yo' blocker 
 Blastin' nothin' but choppers, nigga we non-stoppers 
 Whippin' up this cream, real mean like Betty Crocker 
 The guts icy white tin, leather is what I'm lik-in' 
 Pull up chrome rims, didn't holla, she must be dykin' 
 Like she didn't see the colors change, colors on my paint job 
 Just like all the colors on my ice in my wrist watch 
 Pimps scarred, nothin' but some conversation for some dough 
 Slangin' these words out my mouth like I'm sellin' snow 
 Tellin' no lies, compromise, only cheese wise 
 If ya try to cross, real killers then you must die 
 I keep my cup raised up my nigga 'cause I'm a playa 
 Nigga 'cause I'm a playa, nigga 'cause I'm a playa 
 My dollars stay stackin' and nigga 'cause I'll be mackin' 
 Nigga 'cause I'll be mackin', nigga 'cause I'll be mackin' 
 I keep my cup raised up my nigga 'cause I'm a playa 
 Nigga 'cause I'm a playa, nigga 'cause I'm a playa 
 My dollars stay stackin' and nigga 'cause I'll be mackin' 
 Nigga 'cause I'll be mackin', nigga 'cause I'll be mackin' 
 Mackaroni Pretty Tony Snow keep it poppin' 
 Movin' to the Internet, keep that pussy droppin' 
 Mob it up, slop it up, see the ball chop it up 
 Whip it up, sit down on that meat I'm fit' to push it up 
 If that game was over I'd get some work and cook it up 
 Wanna show let's rook it up, you want a beat I'll hook it up 
 We run the streets I seen a part up in the shit I took it up 
 She wanted me to hit her pussy I'ma go off in her butt 
 What you gon' do, when that thang go to fightin'? 
 I'ma lay ya deep off in them hoes, them hoes be boppin' 
 Tellin' me to stop but bitch, I ain't fit' to stop it 
 Ya pussy is a pit bull bitch, gon' and lock it 
 Fuckin' 'round wit' me I knock ya thang up outta socket 
 Ya ho wanna look at me, ya bitch is outta pocket 
 Flyin' in the Bentley gettin' it sucked just like a rocket 
 Pimp see bitch I got a zoo off in my closet 
 I keep my cup raised up my nigga 'cause I'm a playa 
 Nigga 'cause I'm a playa, nigga 'cause I'm a playa 
 My dollars stay stackin' and nigga 'cause I'll be mackin' 
 Nigga 'cause I'll be mackin', nigga 'cause I'll be mackin' 
 I keep my cup raised up my nigga 'cause I'm a playa 
 Nigga 'cause I'm a playa, nigga 'cause I'm a playa 
 My dollars stay stackin' and nigga 'cause I'll be mackin' 
 Nigga 'cause I'll be mackin', nigga 'cause I'll be mackin' 
 Cruisin' Chelsea Avenue, in the hood it's a sunny day 
 Junts out, walkin' miniskirts, let them bunnies play 
 Money stay in a nigga's pocket wrapped in rubber bands 
 Seven hundred ones wit' 'bout seventy Benjamins 
 Understand couple hollow jackets in the barrel 
 Make a wild nigga wanna walk a straight and narrow 
 My dogs strapped on point, God we like the pharaoh 
 My hundred shots, comin' out the mouth of the calico 
 Yeah' know, mayne a nigga do's what he gon' do 
 I'm lookin' for some beef but the kind at a barbecue 
 Comin' through, flickin' old school, Box Chevy thang 
 Ridin' twenty two's on you fools, let the system bang 
 I keep my cup raised up
