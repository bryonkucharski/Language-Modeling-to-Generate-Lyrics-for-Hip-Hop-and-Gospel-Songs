Uh, what? 
 Smoke somethin' bitch 
 Smoke somethin' 
 I'm up early 'cause my nigga 
 Don't sell dope after night time 
 Love choppin' blades, rollin' hooptie 
 'N move the dope through the pipeline 
 Pimp C bitch, holla at yo' bitch 
 Now yo' bitch on my team 
 Got her buyin' us sticky green 
 Lace some with promythazine 
 Candy sweets, a candy bitch 
 You lookin' at a candy boy 
 I done came down Maine and popped trunk 
 Hit the switch on my candy toy 
 We all young ghetto boys 
 That's why we act this way 
 Tryin' to see a million dollars 
 Hopin' these niggas don't blast today 
 Pro smoke, pro choke 
 Anti-broke, conservative liberal 
 Left-wing slangin', right-wing hangin' 
 In criminal court, it's civil 
 In the middle of reality 
 Unsolved mysteries riddle 
 Knockin' over fat cats 
 And gettin' my thoughts off bits and kibbles 
 On note pads I scribble 
 Write rippers that'll make you think 
 Snap so hard it'll break your synchronicity 
 Fuck it, take it, trick 
 I fake it, blink 'n poof 
 We disappearin' into a shroud of dozier 
 Cloud composures, all-nighters like folgers 
 But bitch I tried to told ya 
 Rollin' Seville 
 Grippin' my steal 
 My Tahoe real 
 Bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel 
 Sedan DeVille 
 House on the hill 
 Countin' up my scrill 
 Bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel 
 Nigga, how you feel 
 I feel so trill 
 Might pop me a pill 
 Bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel 
 House on the hill 
 Marijuana fields 
 Grippin' my steal 
 Bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel 
 They tellin' me, "Bun don't go there" 
 But man I just gots to bring it 
 These niggas they wanna hate on that Texas 
 But scared to sing it 
 They don't know what that star 'bout 
 They don't know what that bar 'bout 
 They don't know what that candy car 'bout 
 Or smokin' that joint 'bout 
 All they know is what the fuck I tell 'em 
 Or what the fuck we sell 'em 
 Smokin' Swishers, wood grain 
 And leavin' stains on cerebellums 
 Rebellum, propell 'em, gel 'em 
 From P.A. to Deep Ellum 
 Tell 'em I tol' 'em 
 Wrote 'em, fuck it, phone 'em, to hell to heaven 
 I just spent 60 G's 
 On a brand new Eldoreze 
 Black-on-black, drop top 'lac 
 Northstar fifth wheel on back 
 Sometimes I feel like Lil' Ke 
 When my trunk steady hummin' 
 Had to leave my bitch 
 'Cause I fell in love with my chrome-plated woman 
 I love my wood wheel Grant 
 '84 Cadillac's that slant 
 Slowed down Screw tapes that knock 
 Blowin' on Green private stock 
 Bitch, I don't eat hamhocks 
 Try 20 ounce Angus beef 
 Hangin' with young niggas, that pack big triggers 
 'N got big-ass diamonds off in they teeth 
 Fifth wheel and grill 
 Candy Seville 
 Might pop a pill 
 Bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel 
 House on the hill 
 Flexin' mils 
 Countin' up my scrill 
 Bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel 
 Comin' down so trill 
 Nigga, how you feel? 
 Might pop a pill 
 Bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel 
 Grippin' the steal 
 Nigga, I'm so real 
 Bitch, how you feel? 
 Nigga, I'm workin' wood wheel 
 Smokin' on bionic, ubonic chronic, it's so ironic 
 Sippin' gin and tonic, supersonic like Johnny Pneumonic 
 We crash your party, piss on your parade 
 Sip syrup like it's Lemonade 
 From Paris to the Palisades to the Promenade 
 Bomb and fade, closes the car, break worlds, it's plain as day 
 That's the game we came to play 
 It don't change, ain't a thang to say 
 It's goin' down in the H-Town 
 Young playa from the South 'bout to blaze a pound 
 Tryin' to find me a bopp with some good mouth 
 I know you freaky bitches know what I'm talkin' 'bout 
 Ain't got no time to play, girl 
 Let me get a little throwed off some good skunk 
 Bitch, didn't you know who the fuck I was 
 Off in the street, lookin' for the good stuff? 
 Bitch, I don't give a fuck about yo' man, so 
 Bitch, tryin' to fuck fast, I'ma fuck slow 
 How the fuck you're gonna out-fuck James, hoe? 
 Like Teddy Pendergrass, you better let it go 
 Gettin' ready fo' head doctors 
 Show shockers, body rockers 
 Late-night do' knockers 
 Gotta break us off big pimpin' 
 Baby, we hoe clockers 
 Bitch bosses, takin' no losses 
 Best go ask Lil' Wee-wee 
 BAND I T, Joe, and Cracka 
 Danja Ray, how 'bout Big Pee Wee? 
 Baby brother, Sweet James Jones 
 Guerilla pimpin' at its finest 
 Leavin' haters and ho-hustlers 
 Behind us, rewind us 
 Touched like Midas 
 These bitch ass niggas they study and bite us 
 Couldn't not recite us, come to our show 
 And bitch niggas try to fight us 
 Hoe niggas scream and talk 
 Trill niggas bust and leave 
 How the fuck you're gonna go to war 
 When you bitch ass niggas ain't got no cheese? 
 Blowin' big kill 
 Million dollar deals 
 Nigga, I'm so trill 
 Bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel 
 Uh, puttin' down one time 
 For the king Lil' J 
 Smoke somethin' bitch
