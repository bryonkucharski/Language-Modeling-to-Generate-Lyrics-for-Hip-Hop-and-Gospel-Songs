Yah, Queens nigga 
 Ali Vegas 
 Generation gap spokesman for the youth 
 L.E.S., urban wolves y'all 
 Big things connection, yah 
 Yo how you going y'all check it 
 (Ali Vegas) 
 Yo, yo have you ever had to change huddles 
 Move to a differant hood see the same struggles 
 Crab routines got the game muffled 
 Old players wish to death but got the same shuffle 
 One move could leave your brain puzzled 
 That's why I stress essentials, bless the tempo 
 With knowledge that perfects the mental 
 Come to Queens see what the rest is into 
 I lost a round but it won't happen twice 
 I got emcees on their knees steady asking Christ 
 How come when they was Ali's age they wasn't half as nice 
 I treat a vet just like an ap-pren-tice 
 Cause the words I speak is more street than crack and dice 
 I was put here to rap, L.E.S. let me hear the track 
 D.O. know I spit a verse make the snare collapse 
 Any affair I'm at my peers is strapped 
 From up north to the telly 
 And all my peers caught in the belly 
 Living life similar to bums sincere black 
 Another day, another dollar, another nigga in court (what's that) 
 That's the theme of New York 
 And if you don't plan to play hard 
 You might as well stay the hell off the court 
 That's the theme of New York (I ain't going nowhere) 
 Where the hustlers work hard for their cash and they hate taking shorts 
 That's the theme of New York (the system got them locked down) 
 And all the grimey niggas plot and scheme 
 To take the shit that you bought, that's the theme of New York 
 (Ali Vegas) 
 Aiyyo these New York City streets is hot 
 Even police get shot 
 Neighbors never speak a lot 
 And citizens they beef with cops 
 Avenues flooded with p.c. shops 
 And reifer spots 
 My place is a sneaker box 
 Some say I need to stop 
 Others ask me when my CD drops 
 I tell them when they stressed to hear it 
 I got felons serving like me while the rest they live it 
 I walk the streets at night but never pivot 
 Only bullets swerve my words 
 Go through your vest and wet your spirit 
 Y'all critics got a lot of nerve 
 I'm him to the third 
 A new king has emerged 
 From out of queens by turning verbs into perfected lyrics 
 And tomorrow they'll say 
 (Ali Vegas) 
 Yo police blitzed the crack game 
 Drug alias switched to rap names 
 Fat chains attract fame 
 Innocent wigs get split when gats flame 
 Cause the ignorant mix their wits with bad aim 
 A young brain stormer 
 Hit harder than hurricane Carter 
 A mental sparker 
 We can rhyme to see whos pencil sharper 
 You are raps newest propaganda 
 Speak with smooth and proper grammar 
 Planets start minana 
 Turning cash legal 
 Just imagine if wanna cap people 
 Impregnate the rich daughter of Rich Porter 
 And create a crack sequel 
 Now that's lethal 
 What you say gangsta 
 (Ali Vegas sung) 
 I don't kow the plan 
 The system snatched half of my dynasty 
 I don't want to leave the city 
 But I know one day they'll try the real on me 
 (So what you say, what you say gangsta
