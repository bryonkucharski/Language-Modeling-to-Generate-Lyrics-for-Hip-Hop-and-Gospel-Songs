 (Ali Vegas) 
 Yo 
 The drama bound to stun you before the gun do (blaow) 
 Better have a spot to run to, stash your bundle 
 Blue and whites come through, lookouts want us 
 That's wrong how they had they guns drawn when they run up on us 
 Hearse I'm under, words dem bug us, it's how they search and slug us 
 For wearin certain colors on the drug strip 
 Full of duck chick that love chips 
 Where I live, you get your mug split 
 For tryin' to stunt and pose, in front of hoes 
 I leave a dozen froze and they cousin closed when I come in shows 
 Me and my lows rock Wolverine ?, and Timbos 
 Everyone in my kin knows, my squadron foul 
 I run with opportunist problem childs 
 That like the robbin style, pussies that act hard and smile 
 You better guard your pals, 'cause I'm 'arnin you 
 Informin you, Ali Vegas do what he wanna do 
 And I'ma rep Queens just like I was born to do

 Rhymin is fundamental 
 Peep the game they put the yung'un into 
 Sprung off a instrumental, holdin' guns inside a rental 
 Rap is 10% lungs, 90% mental 
 But what I want-a know is who sent you 
 To get on quick, rock with the team I was born with 
 A cash hustle, my whole staff tussle 
 And leave you with a bullet in your calf muscle 
 (One more thing) My verses crush you 
 Bring it to Cardan and A+ too 
 'Cause they think they tough Boo 
 If it go there, I let my staff rush you 
 But y'all cats better recognize 
 Ain't nobody seein Ali Vegas, recordwise 
 My team, we be on ? Duke, your team is butter new 
 Top talent critics is sayin' Waterloo 
 Ali have the chickens, sayin' what a cure bastard 
 Urban wolves got the game mastered 
 And everybody on my team is way past sick 
 Nigga what?

 Like this Jamaica Queens pharoah tale 
 How my life is parallel to them inmates 
 Livin' inside a narrow cell 
 The drug lords have shootouts on carousels 
 I done seen it all 
 The average baby couldn't breathe or crawl 
 I was watchin fiends and whores screamin brawl 
 Outside of convenience stores, y'all can't stand it 
 Half of the fam split, we lost Tash 
 Keith Dolla Bill, Uncle Pook Seville, and The Bandit 
 My music bump, on every avenue, boulevard, and Van Wyck 
 I have to sell my records with a pamphlet 
 So y'all cats can get the spot and muscle, to find a hustle 
 We down to tussle, we'll clown and crush you 
 Mellowed out, but still a sinner down to bust you 
 Y'all know the code of the streets 
 Keep a toast when you sleep 
 Stick up kids be patrollin the streets 
 And if you fold on your peeps 
 Wake up slain with holes in your Jeep 
 Nigga what?
