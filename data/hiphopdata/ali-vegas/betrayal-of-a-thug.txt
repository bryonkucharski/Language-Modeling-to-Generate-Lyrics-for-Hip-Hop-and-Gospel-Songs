Yeah yeah y'all... check it out ...yo, 
 Betrayal of a thug, Ali Vegas... 
 Like you just think you down with a nigga, came up with a nigga, 
 Flamed gats with a nigga, then all of a sudden that nigga want power, 
 Man, he wanna take yours... 
 Aiyo, that cop Rico popped Tito poppin' ceelo 
 A hot trio, had the block locked since Eighty-Three yo 
 They was coppin' kilos to see dough 
 Took the block over when nice pulled a hiest and got life in Rio 
 Linked up with this lawyer Primo 
 Tito knew the steelo 
 He knew it wouldn't take much for nice to come home, other niggas was dumb 
 Plus when him and Nice were comin' up them other niggas was young 
 Yo, this ruthless chick he used to troop it wit' 
 She knew the script 
 She knew nice was only doin' a Two to Six 
 He came home in the same zone 
 Heard his Cousin got his brains blown 
 Now that nigga flame chrome 
 They stood on the block all day yo 
 Hustlin' llelo to see pesos 
 Shootin' dice with play-doh 
 Packin' potatoes in Tre-AO's 
 If you was too tired to run you fired your gun and stayed low 
 Pop knew it wouldn't cost a thing 
 For Nice to get them all assassinated 'cause he the boss of Queens 
 He could pay off a fiend, he called his Brother Ismael 
 Smooth killer that get ill, wit' steel 
 He's the one that taught Nice how to use fishscale 
 In '93 he caught a body, skipped bail, moved to Israel 
 Found a wife and crib, raised two righteous kids 
 Got a call from Nice, kissed his wife and slid 
 'Cause he knew the heist was big 
 He put it on his Son that if this war was won 
 He would return home and never again draw his gun 
 But when it come to Fam you can't ignore the streets 
 The poor can't afford to sleep, the wise think before they speak. 
 Yo, shots rang, nosy neighbors and cops came 
 To see who gun sling on the boulevard 
 Where the real will pull your card 
 That day it was full of trife goons with knife wounds and bullet scars 
 They all spit steel, Tito tried to kill Ismael 
 Instead the bullet ricochet'd and split the fade of Nice' Baby Brother 
 Slick Will 
 This where it gets real 
 Called up his Sister Allure, she gifted and raw 
 Swift with the Four 
 Matter fact Shorty quick on the draw 
 She the type to leave you stiff on the floor 
 Pray to God that you get up and start riffin' some more 
 But instead he called two trife dames with tight game 
 Gave 'em up to date photos and precise names 
 They spotted Tito at the dice game 
 Bent off of night train 
 They rose the chome, broke his nose bone and made moves in a white Range 
 Headed back to Queens 
 Ice picks and gats to his spleen 
 Just incase he tried to escape they had him tied in wires and tape that 
 Was drowned in Gasoline 
 He took it past the extreme 
 Where's the other half of ya team 
 Like Ceelo and Pop before we greet you with shots 
 They had Eagles and 'Wops aimed at his knot 
 He had no choice but to break down and start explainin' the plot 
 He gave 'em the drop 
 Pop was havin' a wedding on May Seventh 
 Nice and his Brother Devin would come with all types of weapons 
 Before they crept in the newly weds reception 
 They started wettin' all of his bestmen 
 Ceelo pushed Pop's head in 
 Blew a kiss to his Wife and them him and Nice fled in a Legend.
