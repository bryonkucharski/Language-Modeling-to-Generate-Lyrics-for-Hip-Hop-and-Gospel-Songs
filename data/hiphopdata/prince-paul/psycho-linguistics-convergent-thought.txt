Knick knack, patty I'm never comin' back 
 But the minute that you hear me, you yell, "Get off the crack" 
 I don't know, I guess it be my thought process 
 Fifty below the level of consciousness 
 S.O.S, ring the alarm, red alert 
 When I'm rhymin', sound the siren, the whole works 
 (Why?) 
 'Cause they consider me, mad 
 Alfred E. Neuman got nuttin' on me 
 Public Enemy No.1, now they got me in a cell 
 Living hell, yeah, that be my life 
 'Cause mind don't matter, so I apply mind over matter 
 While they mull matter over mind 
 A threat to mankind, refer to me as subject A 
 Got me pissin' in a cup, all day 
 Mad people, all up in my cerebral 
 Oh shit, what the fuck you doin' with that needle? 
 Argh 
 Almost certainly a psychosomatic condition 
 What is really wrong with the patient? 
 What? They confined to my bed 'cause I'm strapped in 
 Catscan 'cause they wanna know what's happenin' 
 Mentally, physically, to subject B 
 That's showin' signs of the M-A-D-Man, possessed 
 'Cause no rest for the wicked 
 I kick it, I-double-I 'cause I'm twisted 
 Sadistic, a threat to society, I'm locked up 
 In this nut house, 'cause I'm about to blow up 
 Restrained, to maintain my composure 
 Sanity but they can't, too much calamity 
 So they wait then attack 
 I'm too exhausted to even fight back 
 I swear, the end is near, I can feel it 
 My fate, will they seal it?
