Open your mouth 
 I'm gonna put something nice into it 
 Ooh, it feels good 
 Ooh, it feels good 
 Ooh, it feels good 
 Ooh, it feels good 
 Open your mouth 
 I'm gonna put something nice into it 
 Ooh, it feels good 
 Ooh, it feels good 
 Ooh, it feels good 
 Ooh, it feels good 
 Ooh, it feels good 
 (Open your mouth) 
 (I'm gonna put something nice into it) 
 Ooh, it feels good 
 Ooh, it feels good 
 So now we begin to see you as you really are 
 Repressed, hostile, sick, jolly about adjusted 
 Frustrated, aggressive, schizophrenic and masochistic
