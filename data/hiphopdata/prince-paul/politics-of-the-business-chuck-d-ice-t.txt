Politics of the business 
 The business, the business

 Anybody who gets in this business 
 And lives his offer but he's living in a miracle 
 Aw man, fuck the music business, man 
 Fuck that, I wanna say when you just can't say 
 Fuck this business 
 You got to get in where you fit in 
 And understand what you get in 
 I uh, I mean, if somebody sits and talks to me 
 About the music business, I will tell him not to get in it 
 I will tell him that it's very, very, very complicated 
 And hard to actually cease something that living today 
 Politics of the business 
 Rap miserable muscles is that when 
 Cats all of a sudden look at BET 
 And say, "Aw man, we can do that 
 Man, I can outbone Jay-Z" 
 Yeah, in every one of these videos 
 You're gonna see some sacks 
 You're gonna see somebody tote some money 
 Or somebody acting like they shoot you 
 It ain't much in between 
 I have to tell the artist straight forward 
 You are not that great as you think you are 
 You smoke too much fucking weed 
 And when, when, when you hear yourself back 
 Every time, you're coming out and hating yourself 
 Politics of the business, the business, the business 
 You know, that's 
 That's the way to get fucked in the business 
 Of course, it's, it's, it's a cut throat business 
 It's what you know 
 What you know'll save you in this business all the time 
 And it's, I guess it's just the bottom line making a hit record 
 And uh, it's not simple as people think 
 You know it's very complicated 
 Yeah, if it did 
 Everybody would go make one right now
