Mamita vente (mamita vente, mamita vente) 
 Ma-mi-ta (ma-mi-ta) 
 Mamita vente, olvida la gente 
 Sé que tu cuerpo me pide calor 
 Y sé lo que siente', la noche te prende 
 No te preocupes, me gustan mayor 
 Girl, you know you got me feeling you the way you move 
 Baby, bring you closer and let me show you what to do 
 Move it side to side, I know you want a drink or two 
 Let me have your body, let me show what I can do 
 Mami, eres tú quien me provoca 
 Cuando chupa ella sí se pone loca 
 Hazlo lento pero quítate la ropa 
 Enséñame rodillas y abre boca 
 Ah 
 Mami what you doing all alone in the club? 
 Baby get your vibe up, pour another cup 
 Girl I wanna get you all alone out the club 
 Get up in my ride I wanna show you love 
 Sway you like a lullaby-y-y-y-y 
 Dance with me through the ni-i-i-i-ight 
 Back to mi casa baby sli-i-i-i-ide 
 Let me make you feel alri-i-i-i-ight 
 Sway you like a lullaby-y-y-y-y 
 Dance with me through the ni-i-i-i-ight 
 Back to mi casa baby sli-i-i-i-ide 
 Let me make you feel alri-i-i-i-ight 
 Got me caught up in the vibe, now mama let's go 
 I'm a make you shine in the night time (baby) 
 Rolling with a star, you could be my angel 
 Just back that booty up at the right time 
 I can feel you when you dance, you grabbing all on my pants 
 I'm kissing you in advance, baby live it up 
 She putting me in a trance 
 I'm throwing out all my bands 
 She yelling out this is a jam 
 DJ turn it up 
 She want it, she want it 
 We going hard 'til 6 in the morning 
 She need it, she need it 
 I bet the neighbors know my name when she moan it 
 Mami what you doing all alone in the club 
 Baby get your vibe up, pour another cup 
 Girl I wanna get you all alone out the club 
 Get up in my ride I wanna show you love 
 Sway you like a lullaby-y-y-y-y 
 Dance with me through the ni-i-i-i-ight 
 Back to mi casa baby sli-i-i-i-ide 
 Let me make you feel alri-i-i-i-ight 
 Girl I'll have you feeling ri-i-i-i-ight 
 Maybe only for a ni-i-i-i-ight 
 Come with me and feel the vi-i-i-i-ibe 
 Know I wanna get insi-i-i-i-ide 
 Hold it now, the way you spin around 
 Got me so aroused, I can't keep it down 
 Hold it now, the way you spin around 
 Got me so aroused, I can't keep it down 
 By-y-y-y-y 
 Dance with me through the ni-i-i-i-ight 
 Back to mi casa baby sli-i-i-i-ide 
 Let me make you feel alri-i-i-i-ight
