I'm like yo, these niggas is wildin' right now 
 Like, these niggas is really wildin', you know what I'm sayin'? 
 Like, we ain't playin' with y'all niggas, man, ya heard? 
 Sometimes you just gotta catch chlamydia on these niggas, G-shit 
 You know what I'm sayin'? Gonorrhea, all that shit 
 All of that shit 
 I catch all diseases in the world 
 So the world don't have no more diseases, you feel me? 
 (G-shit) Yeah, yeah 
 P. Soul on the track 
 I'm as real as they come, they feel it, get numb 
 You think you got a little buzz, so now you can't get stung? 
 I keep a razor blade tucked on me, runnin' my tongue 
 Don't let me have to tell these niggas about the city I'm from 
 It's Brooklyn, be the home of hardest ever 
 Where them niggas don't aim, they just palm Berettas 
 And bomb whatever, say we don't move calmly never 
 This for my niggas trapped in cells like salmonella 
 Look, I could do this shit with no effort 
 No pressure, no gimmick shit, no radio records 
 Just textbook rhyme style with the raw texture 
 Punchlines, right hooks, now that's a trifecta 
 No more free lectures, I'm taxin' these niggas extra 
 This the Pro of all Eras, he's back in your sector 
 So, might be best to protect your neck 
 Or profess your debt to the god, he might bless ya 
 Murder these flows like I murder these ho- 
 Ass niggas, where the fuck is your energy, bro? 
 Make your nigga deep throat a Desert Eagle 
 If he try me like a ho, pussy boy, that's on my soul 
 Make my flow shapeshift, cold expression like a facelift 
 I could probably swing like eight grips if you talkin' all that ape shit 
 I'm not talkin' YM Bape shit, but I'm bangin' on my chest, bitch 
 Travelin' through the infinity, uh 
 You not that nigga, pretend to be, uh 
 All that bullshit do not get to me, uh 
 I am a spirit, an entity, uh 
 You just wanna suck all my energy, uh 
 I am the realest since Kennedy, uh 
 You pussy ass niggas fuckin' suck, you sound the same 
 I spit the pain, that's why the young niggas feel the same 
 They know I bang, I pull a fuckin' pistol out the Range and act insane 
 I spent years at the crib, so I don't feel the pain no more 
 I don't feel the pain no more 
 I gotta get it how I live, I don't feel the pain no more 
 I don't feel the pain no more 
 I spent years at the crib, so I don't feel the pain no more 
 I don't feel the pain no more 
 I gotta get it how I live, so I don't feel the pain no more 
 I don't feel the pain no 
 I spent years at the crib, so I don't feel the pain no more 
 So I don't feel the pain no more 
 I gotta get it how I live, I don't feel the pain no more 
 I don't feel the pain no more 
 I spent years at the crib, so I don't feel the pain no more 
 I don't feel the pain no more 
 I gotta get it how I live, so I don't feel the pain no more 
 I don't feel the pain no, more
