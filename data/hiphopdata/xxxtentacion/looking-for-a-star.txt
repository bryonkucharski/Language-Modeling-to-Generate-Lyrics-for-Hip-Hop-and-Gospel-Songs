Duh, duh, duh 
 Duh, duh, duh 
 Duh, duh, duh, duh 
 Can't seem to explain a thing 
 Going on in my head (on in my head) 
 The memories seem to fade away 
 With the thoughts in my head (the thoughts in my head) 
 Run from different enemies 
 And the thoughts in my head (thoughts in my head) 
 Run from different enemies 
 And the thoughts in my head, (thoughts, in my) 
 And where did you go as I slipped (as I slipped) 
 I can't seem to get out my head (out my head) 
 I went and I'll count the tears I shed (tears I shed, tears I) 
 She sat there and watched as I bled 
 As I bled 
 As I bled 
 As I bled 
 As I bled 
 As I bled 
 And where did you go as I slipped (as I slipped) 
 I can't seem to get out my head (out my head) 
 And where did you go as I slipped (as I slipped) 
 I can't seem to get out my head (out my head)
