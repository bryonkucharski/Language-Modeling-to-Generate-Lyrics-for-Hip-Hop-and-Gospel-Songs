17 
 My collection of nightmares, thoughts, and real life situations I've lived 
 17 is the number tattooed on the right side of my head 
 My own personal number 
 Soon to be explained in future interviews or instances 
 By listening to this album, you are literally, and I cannot stress this enough, literally entering my mind 
 And if you are not willing to accept my emotion and hear my words fully, do not listen 
 I do not value your money 
 I value your acceptance and loyalty 
 Here is my pain and thoughts put into words 
 I put my all into this, in the hopes that it will help cure or at least numb your depression 
 I love you 
 Thank you for listening 
 Enjoy
