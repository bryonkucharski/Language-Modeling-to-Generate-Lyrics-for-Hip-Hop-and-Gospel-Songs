Lost in the good, I 
 Feel so deeply I can't seem to find the means of God 
 Lost in the good, I 
 Feel so deeply I can't seem to find the means of God 
 Hear the cry 
 Sail the world 
 Children, don't cry 
 It won't end 
 Pain will always be my friend 
 Children, don't cry 
 Pain will always be my friend
