Got it on smash 
 Foreign Spanish jawn, I really like your lemonade 
 I put Cartiers all over my bitch's face 
 She just got apparel, all because a nigga paid 
 Put her in the past, 'cause you know 
 Yeah, you know, I smashed 
 Yeah, I smashed, yeah 
 Shawty let me smash 
 So I put her in the past, yeah 
 I put her in the past, yeah, I smashed, yeah 
 Yeah, you know, I smashed (yeah) 
 So I put her in the past, yeah 
 Yeah I put her in the, smash 
 She rock Carti' frames, sweet like candy canes 
 If I'm Superman, she my Lois Lane 
 Gucci everything, Louis everything 
 Had to cut her off, she sniff too much 'caine 
 Don't look so surprised, all she want to do is lie 
 Then she turned around and cried 
 Demons all in her eyes 
 She don't feel no pain, she might be insane 
 Coat her with some rain, pussy lemonade 
 Foreign Spanish jawn, I really like your lemonade 
 I put Cartiers all over my bitch's face 
 She just got apparel, all because a nigga paid 
 Put her in the past, 'cause you know 
 Yeah, you know, I smashed 
 Yeah, I smashed, yeah 
 Shawty let me smash 
 So I put her in the past, yeah 
 I put her in the past, yeah, I smashed, yeah 
 Yeah, you know, I smashed 
 So I put her in the past, yeah
