Ooh, ah, ah, ah 
 Don't go, don't go to sleep 
 Don't go, stay up and don't go 
 Tired of feeling like I'm trapped in my damn mind 
 Tired of feeling like I'm wrapped in a damn lie 
 Tired of feeling like my life is a damn game 
 Nigga really wanna die in the night time 
 Only time I feel pain, when I'm feeling love 
 That's why it's tatted on my face that I'm damn numb 
 Only time I'm in my mind, when I'm all alone 
 That's why I'm never really alone in the night time 
 Change hoes like clothes, I can't get attached 
 'Cause these hoes fire starters like lit matches 
 I've been feeling really lost, ducking all attachments 
 I don't really go outside 'cause I hate traffic 
 I don't wanna go outside, get caught in traffic 
 Tired of feeling like I'm trapped in my damn mind 
 Tired of feeling like I'm wrapped in a damn lie 
 Tired of feeling like my life is a damn game 
 Nigga really wanna die in the night time 
 Tired of feeling like I'm trapped in my damn mind 
 Tired of feeling like I'm wrapped in a damn lie 
 Tired of feeling like my life is a damn game 
 Nigga really wanna die in the night time 
 Tired of feeling like I'm trapped in my damn mind 
 Tired of feeling like I'm wrapped in a damn lie 
 Tired of feeling like my life is a damn game 
 Nigga really wanna die in the night time 
 Nigga really wanna die in the night time 
 Nigga really wanna die in the night time 
 Nigga really wanna die in the night time, uh 
 Nigga really wanna die in the night time, uh 
 Nigga really wanna die in the night time 
 Don't go to sleep 
 Don't go, stay up with me 
 Don't go, don't go to sleep 
 Don't go, stay up and don't 
 Ooh 
 Don't go, don't go to sleep 
 Don't go, stay up and don't
