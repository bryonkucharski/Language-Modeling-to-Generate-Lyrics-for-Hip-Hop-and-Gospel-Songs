Valentine, I watched my red rose turn to gray 
 Let me be, I give your Lord my soul to take 
 It won't hurt me now, I'm numb to all the pain 
 Heaven or hell, I don't know which path to take 
 Valentine, where are you now? 
 'Cause it's people that I hate 
 'Cause my heart has run away 
 Valentine, where are you now? 
 'Cause it's people that I hate 
 'Cause my heart has run away 
 Where are you now, now, now? 
 Where are you now? 
 'Cause it's people that I hate 
 'Cause my heart has run away 
 Where are you now?
