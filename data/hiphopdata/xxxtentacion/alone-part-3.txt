I can't seem to find someone's shoulder 
 Who will I rely on when it's over? 
 Took a chance with you, it made me colder 
 Better on my own when it's all over 
 So when I'm weak, who do I call? 
 My God it hurts, I can't be calm 
 What do I do? Do I run? 
 I'm tired of hate, I'm tired of love 
 I've dug my nails into my arms 
 She turned and left with all my scars 
 What is my worth? 
 What is my worth? 
 Gave my love a piece of me 
 She put my heart beneath her feet 
 She turned and left the question, "What's my worth?" 
 Gave my love a piece of me 
 She put my heart beneath her feet 
 She turned and left the question, "What's my worth?" 
 My worth, my worth
