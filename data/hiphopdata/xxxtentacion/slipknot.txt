 Uh 
 Won't fall my nigga, I slip not 
 Won't fall my nigga, I slip not 
 Won't fall my nigga, I slip not 
 I won't be dead, misled ahead, I never break, uh 
 Won't fall my nigga, I slip not 
 Won't fall my nigga, I slip not, uh 
 Won't fall my nigga, I slip not 
 I won't be dead, misled ahead, I never break, uh 
 Lost in the pessimistic state of perception 
 It's been hard to participate in natural instances 
 And due to my history, I don't know what's next for me 
 But keep my composure, fuck over anyone next to me 
 If dean detriment told me love was for negligent 
 Motherfuckers that can't seem to keep wearin' their head 
 I'm not self-aware, I'm misled, I'm a hypocrite like the rest 
 I will kill myself if it benefit all of my fucking friends 
 I'm sorry mama, I didn't mean to fucking hurt you 
 If I could test my worth, I'll show you heaven on this earth 
 So if alive or in the dirt 
 I swear to God, you'll be my first priority 
 Before the hurt, that mean for better or for worse 
 I said 
 I didn't mean to fucking hurt you 
 If I had to test my worth, I'll show you heaven on this earth 
 So if alive or in the dirt 
 I swear to God, you'll be my first priority 
 Before the hurt, that mean for better or for worse 
 I said 
 Won't fall my nigga, I slip not, uh 
 Won't fall my nigga, I slip not, uh 
 Won't fall my nigga, I slip not 
 I won't be dead, misled ahead, I never break, uh 
 Won't fall my nigga, I slip not, uh 
 Won't fall my nigga, I slip not, uh 
 Won't fall my nigga, I slip not 
 I won't be dead, misled ahead, I never break, uh 
 Through the soulless pit, I never slip, I get a grip 
 My mind drift to a place, where the devil lives 
 My soul rise to the sky, made of abyss 
 With the evidence, that I made with the elements 
 Fuck your settlement, let's settle this now 
 We tearing it down, we make these incredible sounds 
 We cherish them now 
 The pain that was never announced, we singin' it out 
 They look around confused like they ain't figure it out 
 Oh, you can't run away 
 From everything you made 
 You try to erase 
 Memories will fade
