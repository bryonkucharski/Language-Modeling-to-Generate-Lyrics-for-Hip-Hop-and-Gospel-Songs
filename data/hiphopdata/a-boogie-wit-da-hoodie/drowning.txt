I'm drownin' 
 I'm drownin' 
 I'm drownin' 
 I'm drownin' 
 Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I'm drownin' 
 In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a fountain 
 Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded 
 Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin' 
 I just bought a Cuban ring and dipped it in a fountain 
 Chain so heavy I feel like I'm holdin' up a mountain 
 Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded 
 Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin' 
 I'm with all my niggas, I don't go nowhere without 'em 
 If they don't let us in they might throw shots at the bouncer 
 Actavis medicine, got it straight from out the doctor's 
 I'm with RJ but I call him Wayne 'cause he's a shotta 
 Pick up the ladder, put it in the gun, make the 9 stretch 
 Niggas with attitude, but we come straight out of Highbridge 
 I'm gon' make her panties wet when she see the way I flex 
 I'm gon' win a Grammy, move my family out the projects 
 We went from chillin' in the projects to makin' projects 
 We was tryna get to the top, and they tried to stop us 
 I talk for myself, bitch I don't need no fucking voucher 
 She looked at my wrist and she looked at a hundred thousand 
 Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I'm drownin' 
 In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a fountain 
 Every where that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded 
 Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin' 
 I just bought a Cuban ring and dipped it in a fountain 
 Chain so heavy I feel like I'm holdin' up a mountain 
 Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded 
 Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin' 
 Just bought a brand new chain from Avianne 
 Nigga with attitude but I ain't from Compton 
 Lil Kodak, bitch, I'm Polo'd down like Carlton 
 Sniper Gang I put a nigga on a carton 
 I'm the shit I'm fartin', I don't know how to potty 
 Pull up in a 'Rari, I'm in the Yo like Gotti 
 A Boogie, I'm goin' Scottie, nigga drop my deposit 
 I ain't Jamaican, bitch I'm Haitian, but I got them shottas 
 Harley Davidson every day, I'm ridin' with the chopper 
 They hatin', I know they don't wanna see a nigga prosper 
 I ain't doing trims, I'm in the cut like I'm a barber 
 She call me daddy, but I ain't her motherfucking father 
 Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I'm drownin' 
 In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a fountain 
 Every where that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded 
 Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin' 
 I just bought a Cuban ring and dipped it in a fountain 
 Chain so heavy I feel like I'm holdin' up a mountain 
 Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded 
 Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin' 
 Bitch, I'm drownin' 
 Bitch, I'm drownin'
