I promised you would've liked it 
 If I was invited 
 She said she wanna be mine 
 She wasn't with it to ride 
 I had to kick her a side 
 I know it just ain't right 
 But baby you was invited 
 I promised you would've liked it 
 She know I be on my grind 
 So I don't really have time 
 To hit you back on time 
 I would've been in your life 
 But I just wasn't invited 
 I think that I would've liked it 
 I was exited I thought you was mine 
 You were really wasting my time 
 But damn I can't lie 
 She ride the pipe like she bike it 
 You was the rock to my diamond 
 The way we could've been shining 
 We would've been fine 
 But girl you had to decide 
 I thought that you was my type 
 I wish that I could rewind it 
 But I guess I'll never mind it 
 Tell me what you want 
 Tell me why you fronting? 
 Is this really what you wanted ? keep it a hunnit 
 Every time you started fussing 
 I changed the subject 
 Every time you hear this song is gon' get you upset 
 You gon' hear it in they headphones on the bar set 
 If I see you up in public straight Stuntin' 
 Cop another pair of Mains then I go to London 
 Would've put you on a plane in some Red Bottoms 
 She said she wanna be mine 
 She wasn't with it to ride 
 I had to kick her a side 
 I know it just ain't right 
 But baby you was invited 
 I promised you would've liked it 
 She know I be on my grind 
 So I don't really have time 
 To hit you back on time 
 I would've been in your life 
 But I just wasn't invited 
 I think that I would've liked it 
 You was a slide 
 I don't think I can look at you in ya eyes 
 You cheated on me and lied 
 And I think you liked it 
 You're so damn trifling 
 You was a thot and I wifed it 
 There's no one like this 
 Look at my ice you could've been right beside it 
 I'm still thug lightening 
 (?) License you my lil Light skin 
 'Cause I know she gon' hide it 
 You prolly think I'm bluffing 
 I ain't Frontin' I turn nothing into something 
 Now I'm Stuntin it's just us I won't switch up yeah 
 I love my Bousins others talk behind my back 
 So I can't trust them 
 Oh I think I started something now they upset 
 Everybody I came up with I'm still stuck with 
 Every girl that I was with I had no love with 
 Now all I ever wanna do is boss shit 
 She said she wanna be mine 
 She wasn't with it to ride 
 I had to kick her a side 
 I know it just ain't right 
 But baby you was invited 
 I promised you would've liked it 
 She know I be on my grind 
 So I don't really have time 
 To hit you back on time 
 I would've been in your life 
 But I just wasn't invited 
 I think that I would've liked it 
 Why you think my name is Artist ? I'm an Artist
