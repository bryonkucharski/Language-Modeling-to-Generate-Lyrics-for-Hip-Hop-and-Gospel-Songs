 I was in lust with it, told her that I cannot fuck with it 
 She like how I'm modest and she call me Artist 
 I love when she scream out my government (name) 
 I met her at Anex, I took her to my place 
 We fucked then popped bottles of bubbly 
 She ended up popping the Percs 
 She was wildin', I think she just needed some company 
 I will not blame you for not resisting 
 You know I've been looking for time to kick it 
 Busy on Instagram liking pictures 
 You need to stop playing and come and visit 
 I need your location inside the DM 
 Your friends in the back, they like go and see him"
