I know you been needing somebody 
 Mustard on the beat, ho! 
 Look, I know you been needing somebody 
 Nobody really got me like I got me 
 Just tell me what you really want from me 
 It's no problem, I'ma go see if I got it 
 Just tell me what you really want from me 
 What you really want? 
 Look, I know you been needing somebody 
 Nobody really got me like I got me 
 Just tell me what you really want from me 
 It's no problem, I'ma go see if I got it 
 If I got it, then you got it it's no problem 
 Hoes plotting, thinking that we don't know 'bout 'em 
 I wonder what the fuck they want from me 
 I know that you been needing somebody 
 I know your head sloppy 
 You really do it like you care about me 
 Avianne got me feeling like I'm playing hockey 
 Rap money got me pulling up in big bodies 
 Big bodies little niggas don't know shit about me 
 Call me Artie I love to party, shooters beside me 
 Left the rari' inside the parking lot oh I'm sorry 
 Ended up with a Spanish mami calling me papi 
 Acting cocky when she really don't know shit about me 
 Though they wonder why I always got my clique by me 
 Don't touch me, you'll be lucky that you sit by me 
 They don't get it till they really see their bitch by me 
 Got a trophy on my arm, I keep my wrist icy 
 If you want it, nigga, then you gotta get by me 
 Always wanted a Patek, now I can like three 
 If you think it's too late, then it just might be 
 Look, I know you been needing somebody 
 Nobody really got me like I got me 
 Just tell me what you really want from me 
 It's no problem, I'ma go see if I got it 
 If I got it, then you got it it's no problem 
 Hoes plotting, thinking that we don't know 'bout 'em 
 I wonder what the fuck they want from me 
 I know that you been needing somebody 
 We can get it popping for the night though 
 You know my style, red bottoms, only the spikes though 
 Yeah, it's always a light show whenever the ice glow 
 Couple more shots, ain't no tellin' where we might go 
 Take it to Marianna, we can take it to the trap 
 Spittin' on my mic, shoulda put it on the track 
 Fuck around and have you butt naked on my Snap 
 With your legs on the air, got you shakin' on your back like 
 Wait, I think she catchin' a seizure 
 All my old hoes tell me I'm catchin' amnesia 
 A different kind of beast, I'm not a regular creature 
 Drop two-seater beamer, cranberry its features 
 What they really want from the nigga? 
 What you really want? 
 What the fuck they really want from a nigga? 
 I know you been needing somebody 
 Nobody really got me like I got me 
 Just tell me what you really want from me 
 It's no problem, I'ma go see if I got it 
 If I got it, then you got it it's no problem 
 Hoes plotting, thinking that we don't know 'bout 'em 
 I wonder what the fuck they want from me 
 I know that you been needing somebody
