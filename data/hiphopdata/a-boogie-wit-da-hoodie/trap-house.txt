 In the trap house cooking, couple birds all took it 
 Hunnit grand need rubber bands, nigga understand I'm juggin' 
 Keep on thinking I'm pussy, ain't a killer don't push me 
 Got to make enough to bail out, just in case the police book me 
 50k up in the trap house, 100k up in the stash house 
 China man for the cash out, run it up till I max out 
 What I say up in this trap house, better stay up in this trap house 
 Ate the cheddar he a rat now, had to put him in a bag now 
 Ah! Had to put him in a bag now
