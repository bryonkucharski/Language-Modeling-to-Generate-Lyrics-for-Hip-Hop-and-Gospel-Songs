Nigga this is what that jungle do 
 You been plottin' nigga, wasn't you? 
 I should have never even fucked with you 
 Yeah I started in the back, had to skip the line though 
 I'ma keep that shit a stack till my fucking time go 
 Niggas throw you in the shade 'cause they wanna shine though 
 Nigga throw me in the grave in a Ferragamo 
 Man I can't believe they killed my fucking bro Quado 
 Shit was so deep I had to say that with my eyes closed 
 That shit made me wanna treat a nigga like he John Doe 
 Nine on me Rondo, now that nigga John Doe 
 This is all I ever wanted nigga 
 Why would I let you take it from me nigga? 
 I ain't stupid, ain't no dummy nigga 
 A couple fingers on a couple triggers 
 Fuck with you, why would I fuck with you? 
 You been plottin', nigga wasn't you? 
 I should have been watching from the jump with you 
 Fuck it, this is what that jungle do 
 Started, what I started 
 Anybody want a problem, this is my shit 
 Tell em' if they want a problem I'm from Highbridge 
 Got a nigga with a shotgun up in my whip 
 Making bitches go retarded with this hard dick 
 Why you think my name is Artist? I'm an artist 
 I woke up to a ménage, I'm just being honest 
 I get money, if I want it, I'ma cop it 
 If a nigga want static let him have it 
 Have you ever seen a mini semi-automatic? 
 It go dumb like a drum it'll be blastin' 
 When it come to that fire, I'm a fucking dragon 
 Nigga this is what that jungle do 
 Nigga this is what that jungle do 
 You been plottin' nigga wasn't you? 
 I should have never even fuck with you 
 I was walking in the rain with my Timbs on 
 Stepping over puddles full of pain, it's a big storm 
 13 on my Balmains, it's a big storm 
 In the club love to make it rain 
 Like what nigga, we don't fuck withcha 
 Know I'm all about my bucks nigga, I don't trust niggas 
 Ever since I was a young nigga coming up nigga 
 Ain't nobody show me love nigga, so it's fuck niggas 
 It's just us nigga 
 Nigga this is what that jungle do 
 Nigga this is what that jungle do 
 That jungle turned me into a monster 
 That jungle made me go harder 
 That jungle turned me to a monster 
 That jungle made me go harder 
 That jungle turned me to a monster 
 That jungle made me go harder 
 That jungle turned me to a monster 
 That jungle made me go harder 
 The jungle turned me to a monster 
 The jungle made me go harder 
 Jungle turned me to a monster 
 Nigga this is what that jungle do 
 Nigga this is what the jungle do 
 Been plottin' nigga, wasn't you? 
 Should have never even fucked with you
