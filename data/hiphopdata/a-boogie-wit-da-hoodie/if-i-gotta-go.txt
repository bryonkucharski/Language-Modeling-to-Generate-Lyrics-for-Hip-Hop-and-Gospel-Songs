I seen a lotta bitches get slid in and make me not want to be faithful to bitches 
 I did a lotta fucked up shit and I know I was wrong but just pray for a nigga 
 I look up at Quo 
 I wish I could look at my bro but now he keep a angel with niggas 
 Beastie you know 
 I'm goin' in on these niggas 
 I am not playin' with niggas 
 If I gotta go 
 I know that the rest of my niggas is gonna put pain on them niggas 
 I already know 
 Nothin' to say to them niggas 
 Just let it rain on them niggas 
 Just let it go 
 Go ahead and call me lil' nigga 
 I be with them gangsta lil' niggas 
 I fuck with my bros 
 I won't switch up on my niggas 
 I show love to all of my niggas 
 Can I come by, fuck what happened last night 
 I need good vibes, don't you give me bad vibes 
 Enemies that turned into my allies 
 I think I would die before I switched sides 
 I went to war with niggas, but we used to be friends though 
 You was my nigga 
 I wish the best for you even though you want me dead though 
 Melody need me 
 She gotta see me on TV, no nigga I can't go 
 I wasn't with it 
 I had to get it with niggas that thought I was scared though 
 Bitches be all on my dick but they never would notice me if I was dead broke 
 I used to posted up right on that strip with a stick 
 I was just like a scarecrow 
 Sosa was with me, he had a strap on him 
 You woulda thought it was Velcro 
 I was on 50 when niggas givin' out a buck 50 for damn codes 
 I had to grip it when they tried to catch me slippin' 
 Nigga, I was like "Hell, no" 
 I move a millie 
 I keep some gang members with me in every damn show 
 Up in my city 
 I keep a heater around 'cause I know how it gets cold 
 Bitches be tricky 
 I know that I can never put my trust into damn hoes 
 I seen a lotta bitches get slid in and make me not want to be faithful to bitches 
 I did a lotta fucked up shit and I know I was wrong but just pray for a nigga 
 I look up at Quo 
 I wish I could look at my bro but now he keep a angel with niggas 
 Beastie you know 
 I'm goin' in on these niggas 
 I am not playin' with niggas 
 If I gotta go 
 Which of my niggas is gonna put pain on them niggas? 
 Let it rain on them niggas 
 I coulda went plain on a Patek but I had to flood it though 
 I coulda put S size on a Cuban but I'm gettin' money though 
 I gotta stay to myself 
 Niggas say that they gon' do shit but nigga I never know 
 I got a H on my belt and the band don't come with it, I gotta be color though 
 The VVS's on my chain, VVS's on me lookin' so colorful 
 VVS's on my ring, VVS's on the plane so colorful 
 Mike Amiri Billie Jean, red bottoms on the stage 
 I fuck it up 
 Drivin' 488s 
 Used to have to take the train, but fuck it though 
 Big safe, big face, big Wraith, nothing but big things 
 Big bank take lil' bank, nigga, but I be in big banks 
 Young MJ from where the niggas play 
 Pull up with six rings 
 Ice on my arm like my wrist sprained 
 So many hoes I forget names 
 I seen a lotta bitches get slid in and make me not want to be faithful to bitches 
 I did a lotta fucked up shit and I know I was wrong but just pray for a nigga 
 I look up at Quo 
 I wish I could look at my bro but now he keep a angel with niggas
