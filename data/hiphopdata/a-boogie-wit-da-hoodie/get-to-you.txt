Metro Boomin' make it boom 
 Yeah, Metro Boomin' make it boom, make it boom 
 Don't be telling me you're through 
 'Cause I be thinking, that it's true, that it's true 
 Telling me about your new boo 
 When I don't wanna face the truth, if it's true 
 I just wanna get to you 
 Anything to get to you, get to you 
 I just wanna get to you 
 Anything to get to you, get to you 
 I always had you in some new 'Loubs 
 Never let you complain about your shoes, 'bout your shoes 
 When nobody would listen to me 
 I know, that I can talk to you, talk to you 
 'Cause everybody else is clueless, no excuses 
 Keep on saying they gon' do shit, never do shit 
 She keep saying she gon' use me, I'mma use her 
 I got on so many jewels, I feel like a jeweler 
 I pulled up in a Patek, you pulled up in a Mueller 
 Double wedding band ring, she pulled up in a new fur 
 Metro Boomin' on the beat, I feel like I'm cheating 
 Showing me that nipple ring, I feel like you teasing 
 You keep begging me to eat, girl, why you beasting? 
 Can I take you to my suite? Yeah, for a weekend 
 Can you come and give me brain? Make me a genius 
 I could make that pussy beatbox, while I'm singing 
 But when you tell me you're through 
 I start to think, that shit is true, is it true? 
 Telling me about your new boo 
 When I don't wanna face the truth, if it's true 
 I just wanna get to you 
 Anything to get to you, get to you 
 I just wanna get to you 
 Anything to get to you, get to you 
 I just wanna get to... 
 I need to care to you, carefully, carefully 
 I'm moving carefully, iggin' me, iggin' me 
 It don't make sense to me, send for me, send for me 
 Need you to win for me, care for me, care for me 
 And if you care, make time for me, make time for me 
 And when you lie to me, it just be killing me 
 You're acting differently, I need to get to you 
 I need you there for me, I need to get to you 
 I need to get to you, carefully, carefully 
 I'm moving carefully, iggin' me, iggin' me 
 It don't make sense to me, send for me, send for me 
 Need you to win for me, care for me, care for me 
 And if you care, make time for me, make time for me 
 And when you lie to me it just be killing me 
 You're acting differently, I need to care to you 
 I need you there for me 
 If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
