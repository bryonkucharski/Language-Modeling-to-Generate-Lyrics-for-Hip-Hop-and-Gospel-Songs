One hunnet, keep it one hunnit 
 I just hope you don't switch up on me 
 I love it when you keep it one hunnit 
 Run it up, run it up on em 
 Girl we could run it up on em 
 I just hope you don't switch up on me 
 I love it when you keep it one hunnit 
 One hunnet, one hunnet keep it one hunnit 
 One hunnet, one hunnet keep it one hunnit 
 One hunnet, one hunnet keep it one hunnit 
 One hunnet, one hunnet keep it one hunnit 
 Never really wanted to talk about it 
 Fuck it though I'm bout to talk about it 
 Something told me write a song about it 
 We probably ain't gonna get along about it 
 I froze up when I seen you with him 
 That shit made me want to leave you with him 
 I never even cheated, God damn girl I should've cheated! 
 And I ain't fucking with these bitches, these bitches be eating 
 And I don't want to be a player, you gave me a reason 
 Fucked some bitch the other day I wanted to get even 
 Why are we even doing this, let's just call it even 
 Am I tripping for thinking you was the one I needed? 
 You was all that I wanted you was my everything and 
 You would come home to me I eat it up like Recess 
 You was my peanut butter you know I love my Recess 
 Run it up, run it up on em 
 Girl we could run it up on em 
 I just hope you don't switch up on me 
 I love it when you keep it one hunnit 
 One hunnet, one hunnet keep it one hunnit 
 One hunnet, one hunnet keep it one hunnit 
 One hunnet, one hunnet keep it one hunnit 
 One hunnet, one hunnet keep it one hunnit 
 Don't you lie to me, girl be honest 
 If I wasn't wearing all this designer and fly shit 
 Tell me would you still ride like Jamaicans grinding? 
 And when I cop my first Beamer bet you wanna drive it 
 Nigga fuck it ima make it and go into college 
 Think she fucking cause the name of the label is Highbridge 
 If they wanna know the price of this motherfucking diamond 
 Fuck it we could talk about it with bro at (?) 
 And my flow so cold so I wear a Moncler 
 If you ratting you a dub, and you don't belong here 
 My bitch got a fat butt, Brazilian, long hair 
 God damn we been rocking Balmain all year 
 If you rocking with me, you rocking Balmain too 
 A Boogie wit da hoodie and the Balmain crew 
 Fifty karots on your ring if you want me too 
 I just hope you don't switch up, this is all we do 
 Run it up, run it up on em 
 Girl we could run it up on em 
 I just hope you don't switch up on me 
 I love it when you keep it one hunnit 
 One hunnet, one hunnet keep it one hunnit 
 One hunnet, one hunnet keep it one hunnit 
 One hunnet, one hunnet keep it one hunnit 
 One hunnet, one hunnet keep it one hunnit 
 Bought my new bitch a Chanel bag and she went and told her friends about it 
 I cut my old bitch off she so mad and I know she still think about me 
 No new niggas always so mad circle shining like a ring with diamonds 
 I keep some gangsta niggas with me know that if you even try to think about it 
 If they catch a body I swear I will never speak about it 
 Bring me my bottle all I wanna do is drink about it 
 I could sleep about it 
 This ain't even an automatic my nigga three come out it 
 Same damn time, that's a drilla, read about i
