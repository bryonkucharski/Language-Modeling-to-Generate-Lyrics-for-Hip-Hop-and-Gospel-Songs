Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na 
 Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na 
 I think them niggas is scared of us 
 They flexing but only for cameras 
 I embarrass 'em 
 If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you 
 I think them niggas is scared of us 
 Flexing but only for cameras 
 Nothing these niggas could do to us 
 Who the fuck can they compare to us? 
 Nothing these niggas could say to us 
 I let 'em stare if they stare at us 
 Look at my chain, I embarrass 'em 
 Fuck it, it ain't no comparison 
 These niggas ain't catching up to us 
 I swear these niggas need stamina 
 I broke her heart in a paragraph, turned to a thottie to care it up 
 Now that bitch feel so embarrassing 
 Diamonds be dancing, I blur it up 
 Your shit is fake, you can't swear to it 
 I know you fronting, you panicking, I get dressed up like a mannequin 
 Put on a fit and embarrass 'em, it's so embarrassing 
 I put this beat on my body list 
 Metro a beast, yeah he bodied it, they tried to give me a stylist 
 I told 'em I'm good, yo you wylin' 
 I got sick of wearing Versace, I want red bottoms 
 Don't let me get in a fight with 'em 
 One of them spikes and I might hit him 
 I'm from the jungle, say that you fuck with gorillas 
 I know that you niggas be lying 
 I gotta stay humble, that's why I fuck with the realest 
 I swear I put that on the Bible 
 You stuck in your feelings, say I'm fucking on your bitch 
 And you should've never ever wifed her 
 That's word to my mother, if a nigga take my bitch, fuck it 
 I'ma find another lover, we flex on each other 
 Cuban dripping on my wrist, I could put whatever on the other 
 That's word to my mother 
 I think them niggas is scared of us 
 Flexing but only for cameras 
 Nothing these niggas could do to us 
 Who the fuck can they compare to us

 You gotta be kidding me 
 Most of my shit come from Italy, W up, make 'em sick of me 
 Ice on my pinky too glittery 
 Pass on a show, it ain't shit to me 
 I keep a blicky, just in case a nigga with me ain't with me 
 And I see a enemy, everything litty 
 Plus my fingers kinda sticky from rolling up that icky icky 
 Them cookies be hitting 
 Beam came with the strap, ladder hanging off of that 
 Yeah I get too attatched 
 I ain't fucking with the Act', I be tripping off of that 
 I'ma keep it a stack 
 Mike Amiri's on me stretch 
 But I'm holding all this bread, I'ma keep me a bag 
 They was saying I was next 
 Ever since I hit the booth and I jumped on a track 
 I think them niggas is scared of us 
 Flexing but only for cameras 
 Nothing these niggas could do to us 
 Who the fuck can they compare to us
