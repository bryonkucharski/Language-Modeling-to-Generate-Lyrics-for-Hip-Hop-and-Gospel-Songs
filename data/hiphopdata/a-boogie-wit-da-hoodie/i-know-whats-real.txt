Nigga god damn 
 Spent five bands on some Balmain, that's a lot man 
 I pull strings like a violin, A Boogie, damn he be wylin' 
 Nigga who scared? you think I'm scared? 
 Put them goons on you that's a nightmare 
 I got ten guns, I don't fight fair 
 Gotta buzz now, this a light year 
 This that new shit, got a new bitch 
 I spent two bands on her new kicks 
 Hanging from my neck, that's a Cuban 
 I swear you don't wanna see me lose it 
 When that Cuban, got bust down 
 Told them bitches I don't give a fuck now 
 I'm A Boogie, nigga what now? 
 See me shining, wanna show me love now 
 You a dub now 
 When I see you, I'ma treat you like you see-through 
 Thought I told you I don't need you 
 You is old news, I'ma be cool 
 Nigga stop it 
 I'm from Highbridge where you see a whole lot of fly shit 
 Louis V hoodie on my bitch 
 How I'm flexing you would think I got rich, ah 
 I know, I know what's real so keep it a thousand, ah 
 In the field, swervin' in that Audi 
 Fuck your feelings, fuck whoever doubt it 
 Told the plug ain't no need to count it 
 I know, I know what's real, I know you in the field 
 I know, you say you drill, I know, I know what's real 
 My nigga I seen a lot now 
 And if you talk about that shit you might get shot down 
 I'm immaculate I feel, I see hatred in they grill 
 All blue faces on my bills, I keep thugs with me still 
 Try to take it they gon' kill, got no patience they just drill 
 All they places getting filled, ain't no cake then ain't no deal 
 When I be riding I got it, trust me I got it, I promise 
 I fuck with good girls who look like they coming straight outta Onyx 
 They in college, I pull up on 'em and work on a project 
 My name is Artist, I got it, they give me brain I'm just watching 
 I put my thumb in her butt and she told me nigga you wylin' 
 I keep on fuckin' with her after I say I'm gon' stop it 
 No lovey-dovey no more, baby I'm just being honest 
 I'm going hard and I promise, like I play for the Rockets 
 I put my homie on, now his Rollie on, that shit flooded 
 Balmain hoodie on, I get what I want, I get money 
 Ain't no need to front, this ain't what you want, bitch you buggin' 
 If you say what's real, we could prolly chill, that's a hunnid 
 I know, I know what's real so keep it a thousand, ah 
 In the field, swervin' in that Audi 
 Fuck your feelings, fuck whoever doubt it 
 Told the plug ain't no need to count it 
 I know, I know what's real, I know you in the field 
 I know, you say you drill, I know, I know what's real 
 My nigga I seen a lot now 
 And if you talk about that shit you might get shot down
