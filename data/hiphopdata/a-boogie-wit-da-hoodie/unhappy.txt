Told her I can't fall in love now she, damn 
 She upset, she throwing subs at me 
 She used to call me her daddy 
 Told her I can't fall in love now she, damn 
 She upset, she throwing subs at me 
 She just wanna see me unhappy 
 She used to say, "what's up, daddy" 
 Now she walk past me with a mug, she keep calling me a dub 
 Plus she won't stop throwing subs at me 
 She just wanna see me unhappy 
 But instead I'm in a Lamborghini 
 With a tint, my windows tinted like I care who see me 
 If I tell you all my secrets, it won't be a secret 
 But if I tell you a secret, I hope that you can keep it 
 Mike Amiri denims, couldn't fit the fucking ratchet 
 I'm with a shooter, sorry, if he gotta fucking bag niggas 
 Started calling me the GOAT, I came up from the grass, nigga 
 I got water on my wrist, I told her look at that river 
 I wanna act like I don't know you now 
 My niggas told me I should expose you now 
 But she used to hold it down 
 Just hold it down, just hold it down 
 She used to call me her daddy 
 Told her I can't fall in love now she, damn 
 She upset, she throwing subs at me 
 She just wanna see me unhappy 
 She used to say, "what's up, daddy" 
 Now she walk past me with a mug, she keep calling me a dub 
 Plus she won't stop throwing subs at me 
 She just wanna see me unhappy 
 She wanna be my baby, but she can't take it 
 I only wear this chain for special occasions 
 I be talking too much money, that's a different language 
 And I started losing friends when I got famous 
 If it don't make a dollar, then it don't make sense, amen 
 I be stuffing hundreds in Melody piggy bank 
 I'm that nigga, yeah, I wish a nigga would these days 
 I got rich but I still go back to the hood these days 
 And honestly 
 I be tryna stop thinking about you but even when I do 
 I be reminiscing bad things I did 
 And I know you hate me, you hate me 
 She used to call me her daddy 
 Told her I can't fall in love now she, damn 
 She upset, she throwing subs at me 
 She just wanna see me unhappy 
 She used to say, "what's up, daddy" 
 Now she walk past me with a mug, she keep calling me a dub 
 Plus she won't stop throwing subs at me 
 She just wanna see me unhappy
