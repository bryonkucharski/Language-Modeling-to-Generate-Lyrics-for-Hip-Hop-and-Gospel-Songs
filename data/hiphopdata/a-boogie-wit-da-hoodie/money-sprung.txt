Money sprung, money sprung 
 Fuck it, I'm back with another one 
 Fuck it up and do another one 
 My niggas do not shoot dirty guns 
 Shoot it up and get another one 
 I keep on counting them hundreds up

 Money sprung, money sprung

 Track after track and another one 
 Know that's a hit, they can't fuck with us 
 Nigga, you don't gotta like me 
 To understand where I'm coming from 
 I know you would eat it, what's up 
 Don't chew on the dick like a bubble gum 
 Told herself to be the plug 
 Now everybody wanna fuck with her 
 Everybody need love, everybody need drugs 
 Nobody wanna be a dub 
 Every fit I put on probably cost me like a dub 
 I'm way too up, they can't keep up, yeah, yeah 
 I'm way too stuffed, I faced two cups, yeah, yeah 
 My new chain it look like a puck 
 My nigga, I'm icy as fuck, yeah, yeah 
 I feel like the King of New York 
 My jeweler is better than yours, yeah, yeah 
 A hundred sitting on my neck 
 Another hundred on the arm, yeah, yeah 
 I put the city on my back 
 How can I ever go wrong? Yeah, yeah 
 I don't need no groupie love 
 Go holla at my nigga Don (yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 I put my number in your phone 
 Just DM me if it was wrong (yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 I told her my name is Artist 
 Now she wanna call me Arty 
 Telling me about a party, told her, "I'm the one performing" 
 Fuck it up before the party started 
 Fuck it, I'm back with another one 
 Fuck it up and do another one 
 My niggas do not shoot dirty guns 
 Shoot it up and get another one 
 I keep on counting them hundreds up 
 I think I'm falling in love with 'em

 I'm ahead of the race 
 Flooring the gas, I'm passing the cops that I lead on a chase 
 If they come find out this weapon I placed 
 They might just give me a federal case 
 All of my folks has a residue taste 
 Rollie presidential when that presidential 
 Counting blue strips with the president face 
 I got the votes, don't you ever debate 
 Yeah, yeah, I got a chef at the crib 
 Little hoe, I don't never do dates 
 Yeah, yeah we are not looking for friends 
 So ain't no competitors safe 
 Yeah, yeah, five in the morning 
 I'm drinking on dirty, it's never too late 
 Yeah, yeah, leaving the spot 
 Had to switch up the whip, they was checking the plates 
 I'm still a menace 
 I do what I say and I won't give a fuck if you feel offended 
 You selling your soul just to get attention 
 I crept with a pole 'cause I feel the tension 
 Trappers, they love me, they throw on that Don 
 They get on that road with a pigeon in it 
 Little bitch you know me, I'm really the Don 
 I don't gotta try hard to fit the image 
 Look at my cup, it's Dirty Diana 
 I dropped two bananas and shook up the Fanta 
 Booked in Atlanta 
 I go to the club with the paper and I throw a book on the dancer 
 I am the one they was counting out 
 Now I get hundreds and count it out 
 Designer shit, they can't pronounce it 
 I'm styling out, they tryna spell it and sound it out 
 Yeah, yeah
