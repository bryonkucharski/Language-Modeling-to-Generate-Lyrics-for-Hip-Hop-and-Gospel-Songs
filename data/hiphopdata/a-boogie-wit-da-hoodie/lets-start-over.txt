She said, "Okay, okay, let's start over" 
 Diamonds be the coldest when they all chokers 
 I'm paranoid, my hand on the toaster 
 Everybody duck before they start shooting 
 Fuck around, get hit, it's gon' be all over 
 She ain't wanna step into my fucking room 
 Fuck around and made a bed out the sofa 
 She said, "Okay, okay, let's start over" 
 Told me how she feel and now she all open 
 Now she all open, water from the pussy overflowing 
 'Fore I started stroking, eat it up, her legs on my shoulders 
 Now I'm so focused, yeah yeah, I swear I'm so focused 
 Yeah yeah, I swear I'm so focused 
 Everywhere I go they ask me where I'm going, I don't know you 
 You actin' like you know me, you don't know me so don't call me bro 
 If I take your hoe don't you trip she might not be a hoe 
 I'm just a man, I know I'm just a goat, I'm just an animal 
 If I stop fucking with bitches, can we start over? 
 If I post all of your pictures, can we start over? 
 If I tell you why I love you, can we start over? 
 I never meant to leave you heartbroken 
 If I admit it it can we start over 
 Told you I'm an animal, I was a dog on you 
 You said I was different but I showed you wrong, don't I? 
 I still make you wet the bottom of your dong, don't I? 
 You told me that you don't care, I know you care don't lie 
 When I hit it from the back you be so scared, don't lie 
 Pull your hair and I bet I could break the bed on it 
 The way she gripping on the dick, she broke a nail on it 
 In and out the lobby, had the scale on me 
 Tissue on the camera so the super couldn't tell on me 
 Couple niggas wasn't real, they switched sides on me 
 You told me you was my nigga, but you lied to me 
 Diamonds be the coldest when they all chokers 
 I'm paranoid, my hand on the toaster 
 Everybody duck before they start shooting 
 Fuck around, get hit, it's gon' be all over 
 She ain't wanna step into my fucking room 
 Fuck around and made a bed out the sofa 
 She said, "Okay, okay, let's start over" 
 Told me how she feel and now she all open 
 I was about to go and buy her ass a new ring 
 But instead I spent a hundred on a new chain 
 I was about to scoop her in a Mulsanne 
 But she talk about it every time that we do things 
 Mood swings, you killing me with all these mood swings 
 Don't you know I'm in my zone I'm in my 2-3 
 Shout out to my nigga Reggie for these two 3s 
 I swear my life is like a motherfucking movie 
 Two cribs, one for me and gang, one for you and me 
 Two chains, like I'm Tittyboi and they glittery 
 You a lame to her, now she wanna be my boo thing 
 Keep the same niggas with me, I don't need a new gang 
 If they hate, fuck it I expect a hater to hate 
 I can't let a hater be my friend that man is two-faced 
 Keep the 'K with me, yeah I only keep security 
 The place safe nigga I don't wanna be on TMZ 
 Diamonds be the coldest when they all chokers 
 I'm paranoid, my hand on the toaster 
 Everybody duck before they start shooting 
 Fuck around, get hit, it's gon' be all over 
 She ain't wanna step into my fucking room 
 Fuck around and made a bed out the sofa 
 She said, "Okay, okay, let's start over" 
 Told me how she feel and now she all open
