Its money over everything 
 I put that on everything 
 She held it down when I was down 
 That's why I still fuck with you 
 I was in love with you 
 You was my ride or die bitch 
 Baby wassup with you 
 I could've been doing my thing from the jump 
 But I gave you my everything and that didn't mean anything Now I want better things 
 Fuck it it's money over everything

 Nigga that's Curry on my rollie 
 Keep a backwood for my dodie 
 She keep acting like she know me 
 Run it all spend it all burberry 
 Baby I'm A boogie with a bape hoodie 
 It ain't shit I let a nigga take from me 
 Ima take it to the fucking grave with me 
 They want to treat me like a slave nigga 
 But I'm going up why they hate nigga 
 Can't see me through these Louis shades nigga 
 I just want to get away 
 First I got to put a hundred in the safe nigga 
 I ain't tryin' to be no fucking broke boy 
 Selling dimes for a dope boy 
 I just want to be up on the rode doing shows all the bitches yelling oh boy 
 Girl fuck you and that ole boy 
 Can't believe you left me for a broke boy 
 Fuck it I'm done with this shit

 She held it down when I was down 
 That's why I still fuck with you 
 I was in love with you

 Before I tried to fuck you I wish I knew that I would love you 
 I would've never told you come through 
 You shot me down so now it's fuck you 
 You took a 38 special well ima show you what this tag do 
 You pulled the trigger 'cause I let you 
 When I shoot back I won't miss 
 That's my word I'm through 
 I get money I'm cool 
 I run it up times two and I break bread with my crew 
 I spent 2 on my loubs 
 I can't lose my cool 
 Laces hang off my shoe that's how I rock my Loubs 
 And if you rock with me rock with me I could be honestly popping these bitches in line for me 
 I'm rocking balmain jeans 
 They more than 14 a piece 
 If you see what seen you might turn M.O.E 
 She held it down when I was down 
 That's why I still fuck with you 
 I was in love with you 
 You was my ride or die bitch 
 Baby wassup with you 
 I could've been doing my thing from the jump 
 But I gave you my everything and that didn't 
 Mean anything now I want better things 
 Fuck it it's money over everything
