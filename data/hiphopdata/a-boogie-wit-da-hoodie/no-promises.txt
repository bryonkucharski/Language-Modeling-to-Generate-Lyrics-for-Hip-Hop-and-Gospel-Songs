Wasn't I good to you? 
 Cardo got wings 
 Yeah, at least I was good to you 
 At least I was good to you 
 At least I was good to you 
 At least I was good to you 
 I can't make no fucking promises 
 Lifestyle getting out of control, lifestyle getting ludicrous 
 I made a milli' in less than a year and I blew that on stupid shit 
 Typed it in like "How to make a milli'" I used to Google it 
 Savannah just wanted to see me perform 
 And got hit over stupid shit 
 I woke up and saw the shit right on my phone 
 They don't know who the shooter is 
 You never know, never feel untouchable 
 I touched your soul, made you feel so comfortable 
 If I let you go, I would feel so skeptical 
 Unacceptable, but I still gotta let you know 
 Yeah, that I can't make no fucking promises 
 I can't make no fucking promises, I can't make no fucking promises 
 Yeah, lifestyle on the road, sheesh 
 Used to always want a Rollie, now I want a new two-tone gold Patek 
 Yeah, we couldn't go to Phillipe's 
 I had to be on that corner until it was morning 
 So me and my niggas could eat 
 I be the one with the sauce, I never thought it was sweet 
 I got my foot in the door 
 They never gave me the key, I had to turn to a ki 
 Even when I was a boy 
 I was the man in the streets, I was the man with the heat 
 I was a beast, sheesh 
 He had her heart, but she tried to give it to me 
 Damn, but she can't keep no fucking promises 
 Shit, I'm coming with a lotta money, money comes with a lotta shit 
 Told Mo, "Bring the studio to everywhere we go" and that's a lotta hits 
 Slo-mo in my videos, when the lights out, all my diamonds hit 
 Something 'bout blue faces, I like money conversations 
 Whole lotta 20's that's basic, nigga, fuck it, I'm shameless 
 Can't fuck with a snitch nigga, if you get caught, don't say shit 
 Have you ever met another nigga like me? I bet you won't say shit 
 I went from rags to riches 
 I bagged the bitches that gave me the straight face 
 I hit the baddest bitches 
 It's sad, but I had to curve 'em the same day 
 I treated them bad 
 I wouldn't be mad if I was to get treated the same way 
 So treat me the same way, same way, same way 
 I was a savage to you 
 I had to give up and put all my hoes to the side 
 I swear if I ever left you in the cold 
 It's cause it was colder inside 
 Look here, I swear if you ever try to leave me alone 
 I hope you don't turn to a thot 
 Most of the niggas that call me only hit my phone 
 Because I get money a lot 
 I be the one with the throne 
 You say you gon' take it but nigga we know that's a lie 
 Even before we was on 
 The money was long and we used to fuck with the spot 
 Bitches be singing my song 
 I knew I was on, right when I bust down a watch 
 Niggas was hating before and they hate on me now 
 But don't know what to say to me now 
 I was gonna do it to her, but I don't really wanna use her 
 Keep giving excuses, when we really gonna link up? 
 Even if I sound stupid, I'ma say what's real to her 
 Even if she not truthful, fuck it I'ma still be good to you 
 Yeah, at least I was good to you 
 At least I was good to you 
 Yeah, at least I was good to you 
 At least I was good to you
