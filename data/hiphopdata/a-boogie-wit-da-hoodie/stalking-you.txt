And I feel like I'm 
 By accident 
 I feel like I'm stalking you, I swear 
 I keep on watching your snaps, I'm stuck on your Instagram 
 And girl, I don't even follow you, I can't 
 Too busy calling you back, sometimes I don't understand 
 But girl, I feel like I walk past you, flexed on you by accident 
 I hopped in a Bentley, I don't plan on crashing it 
 I told you that I love you baby, I was gassin it 
 Gold blunts rolled up, I ain't mashing it 
 Before you was my baby baby you was just a friend 
 And know that I was just in the streets hustlin 
 They threw me in the jungle so I started bussin licks 
 I ran into a mic and then I said, "Fuck the shit" 
 They call me young Mike, bout to get the glove and shit 
 Two diamond rings yeah I paid a dub for it 
 Throw subs at me bet I don't respond to it 
 I'm countin' up money while you niggas commenting 
 Stuck on your ex and I can get you over it 
 VVS on my neck, let's come and see how cold it get 
 Before I sent you that message I was on my thirty years and 
 I was drinking a somethin' but still I put the dirty in it 
 And I swear, that's why I'm watching your snaps 
 I'm stuck on your Instagram 
 And girl, I don't even follow you, I can't 
 Too busy calling you back, sometimes I don't understand 
 I feel like I'm stalking you, I swear 
 I keep on watching your snaps, I'm stuck on your Instagram 
 And girl, I don't even follow you, I can't 
 Too busy calling you back, sometimes I don't understand 
 I feel like I'm 
 Should pick you up in my spaceship 
 You're way too good for me 
 I ran out of shit to say, she ask me questions all day 
 I can't keep making up stories 
 She said goodbye and left me in the cold 
 If I can't take it, I'm sorry 
 I need good vibes, if not, leave me alone 
 I swear I hate to see you walk away 
 But you look so damn good when you walk away 
 Do you ever think about stalkin' me 
 'Cause I do just in case you been wondering 
 And I swear, that's why I'm watching your snaps 
 I'm stuck on your Instagram 
 And girl, I don't even follow you, I can't 
 Too busy calling you back, sometimes I don't understand 
 I feel like I'm stalking you, I swear 
 I keep on watching your snaps, I'm stuck on your Instagram 
 And girl, I don't even follow you, I can't 
 Too busy calling you back, sometimes I don't understand 
 I feel like I'm
