(Ness on the beat) 
 What the fuck I'm supposed to say? 
 What the fuck I'm supposed to say? Ay 
 What the fuck I'm supposed to say? 
 Police pull me over, they ain't got nothing to say 
 I told 'em, "I got tints because I'm rich", they said, "Okay", ay 
 Gotta pray a lot niggas get shot up everyday, ay 
 Hold up, what the fuck I'm supposed to say? 
 Police pull me over, they ain't got nothing to say 
 I told 'em, "I got tints because I'm rich", they said, "Okay", ay 
 Gotta pray a lot, niggas get shot up everyday, ay 
 Heard you got a big body but a little face, ay 
 Got a 41 bezel, it's 100K, ay 
 If I feel a way then I'm gon' say it to your face, ay 
 If I play the block today, I'll make 100K, ay 
 Yeah, I just might make 100K, yeah 
 If they put a price on me, I'll double what they pay, yeah 
 They say they don't like me, give a fuck 'bout what they say, yeah 
 I could take your bitch and make you think about what you say, yeah 
 I'm gon' put her in a leg lock like MMA, yeah 
 I'm gon' let her give me head twice if she don't say shit 
 If she ever turn sherm on me then she basic 
 Couple bitches had to swerve on 'em, I updated 
 You pulled up with her, she ain't leave with who she came with 
 She deserve better, you's a bird, you's a wasteman 
 Fuck a umbrella, change weather in my spaceship 
 Diamonds dancing, I'm two-stepping with my bracelet 
 So, get the fuck up out my face 
 I'm just on my way to get this money and I'm late, okay 
 In the strip club throwing twenties like "I'll be okay" 
 100k a day, trap booming like an 808 
 Yeah, what the fuck I'm supposed to say? 
 Police pull me over, they ain't got nothing to say 
 I told 'em, "I got tints because I'm rich", they said, "Okay", ay 
 Gotta pray a lot niggas get shot up everyday, ay 
 Heard you got a big body but a little face, ay 
 Got a 41 bezel, it's 100K, ay 
 If I feel a way then I'm gon' say it to your face, ay 
 If I play the block today, I'll make 100K, ay 
 Hold up, talking shit don't ever get to me 
 When they see me now, they'd better have that same energy 
 In abandoned houses, in and out, it wasn't shit to me 
 When you see me now, don't try to act like you remember me 
 Then look at me now, bitch I'm drowning 
 And my hoodie Saint Laurent, it's a thousand 
 And we come straight out the Bronx so we wildin' 
 Shoutout BK, free Bobby and free Rowdy 
 Free my nigga V12, holla if you see 12 
 Febreeze, believe me, it'll cover the weed smell 
 I probably got 3 mill, sitting in my email 
 So much on me, they second guessing what we sell 
 So much money on me, fuck it if it's dirty money 
 'Cause I earned it, you get murked if you come searchin' for me 
 When the police pulled me over, I had 30 on me 
 What the fuck I look like with less than 30 on me, nigga? 
 Yeah, what the fuck I'm supposed to say? 
 Police pull me over, they ain't got nothing to say 
 I told 'em, "I got tints because I'm rich", they said, "Okay", ay 
 Gotta pray a lot niggas get shot up everyday, ay 
 Heard you got a big body but a little face, ay 
 Got a 41 bezel, it's 100K, ay 
 If I play the block today, I'll make 100K, ay 
 If I play the block today, I'll make 100K, yeah 
 I'll make her say a' 
 I'll make her say a' 
 I'll make her say a'
