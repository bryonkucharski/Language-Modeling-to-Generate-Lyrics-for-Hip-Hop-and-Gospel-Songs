Would I be trippin' 
 If I tell you I'm different 'cause everyone's different? 
 But, look, I'm somethin' different 
 Melody gifted, you are my witness 
 Louboutin Christians, givin' me blisters 
 I'm sinnin', but I miss you, and girl, do you miss me? 
 What's the difference between fuckin' and kissin'? 
 If you ain't with it, then we can just kick it 
 Fuck all the kissin' 
 We should just get into switchin' positions 
 Fuckin' and kissin', fuckin' and kissin', girl, fuckin' and kissin' 
 Girl, do you miss me? You trippin' 'cause I miss you 
 Fuckin' and kissin', fuckin' and kissin', girl, fuckin' and kissin' 
 Fuck me and kiss me, like you miss me, I know you miss it 
 Fuckin' and kissin', fuckin' and kissin', girl, fuckin' and kissin' 
 Fuck me and kiss me, like you miss me 'cause I know you miss it 
 Next time I fuck you, I don't want you to say, "I love you" 
 And next time you suck it, don't touch it 
 Do somethin' that's gon' make me cum quick 
 I wanna see how you bust it 
 But if you start buggin' 
 I'ma fall back and start actin' like I never met you 
 My money bigger, if I take your bitch 
 Man, I don't mean to be disrespectful, I'm just that nigga 
 Would I be trippin' 
 If I DM your friends and fuck all your bitches? 
 Would it be ignant? 
 You say I'm trippin' but they the ones with it 
 I thought it was love 
 Till you went out tellin' our business 
 Lyin' when you know you did it 
 Cryin' but don't see no tears 
 I guess we really all guilty 
 Fake friends all circle 'round me 
 You wanna show everybody 'round me how I'm bleeding 
 Plead the truth, will set you free 
 Fuckin' and kissin', fuckin' and kissin', girl, fuckin' and kissin' 
 Fuck me and kiss me like you miss me, I know you miss it 
 Fuckin' and kissin', fuckin' and kissin', girl, fuckin' and kissin' 
 Fuck me and kiss me like you miss me 'cause I know you miss it
