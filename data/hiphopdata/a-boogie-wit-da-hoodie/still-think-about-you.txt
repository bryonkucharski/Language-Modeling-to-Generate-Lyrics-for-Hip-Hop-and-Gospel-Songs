Now I'm saying what's good with you 
 I remember being in the hall with you 
 I still think about you 
 Fuck all the phony shit 
 Fuck it I'm stuck on some doly shit 
 Had a knife in my back when I wrote this shit 
 I look back and I laugh when I noticed it 
 I shoot up and lean back on some Kobe Shit 
 They don't know how to pass on some Kobe shit 
 Should've listened my mom always told me this 
 I was only thirteen when she told me this: 
 "Watch who you fuck with 
 And never ever trust a nigga for nothing 
 Even if you feel like you really love her 
 Don't ever tell that bitch that you really love her 
 'Cause that's when she's gon' make you feel like you nothing 
 And that's when you gon' start to feel like you buggin' 
 I wish I wouldve never told you wassup 
 And I wish I never even told you pull up 
 Got me saying what's good with you 
 I remember being in the hall with you 
 Everything was always on the stove with you 
 Girl I even bust a couple jaws with you 
 I still think about you 
 Girl I still think about you 
 Said you always gon' be there for me 
 Now you gone and you just disappeared on me 
 Can't believe I really thought you cared for me 
 You was supposed to be the one that's here with me 
 I still think about you 
 Girl I still think about you 
 I hope that I never see you again 
 I don't wanna put up with it 
 I don't wanna fuck with it 
 Imma just send you this letter whenever I'm done with it 
 I know you gon' read it 
 I called you a bitch at the end 
 I don't know if I mean it 
 I ain't wanna believe what my niggas was telling me 
 My nigga I should've cheated 
 And now I feel stupid 
 I should've knew better than this 
 Wasn't the right way to do it 
 I should've been choosing the money instead of a bitch 
 Fuck it 'cause I'm getting 
 Just watch how I do it 
 I knew I was ready for this 
 Bitch imma focus on music 
 You love how I do it 
 I knew I was ready for this 
 Got me saying what's good with you 
 I remember being in the hall with you 
 Everything was always on the stove with you 
 Girl I even bust a couple jaws with you 
 I still think about you 
 Girl I still think about you 
 Said you always gon' be there for me 
 Now you gone and you just disappeared on me 
 Can't believe I really thought you cared for me 
 You was supposed to be the one that's here with me 
 I still think about you 
 Girl I still think about you 
 But all I can say is you dumb hard 
 You got me feeling stupid 
 You got me singing all these love songs 
 What the fuck am I doing 
 I don't know what I'm doing 
 But I'm going up though I just hope I don't lose it 
 Bitches picking and choosing 
 But I know wassup tho 
 I already been through it 
 We could've been balling together 
 Hit up the mall its whatever 
 You know that I started from nothing 
 Them bitches was fed up 
 The way you made all of them jealous 
 You said that you was gon' ride forever and ever 
 You told me forever and ever
