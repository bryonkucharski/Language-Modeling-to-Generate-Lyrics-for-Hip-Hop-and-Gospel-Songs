 My chick bad, badder than yours 
 My my chick bad, badder than yours 
 My my my chick bad, badder than yours 
 My my chick bad, badder than yours 
 Ride or die chick with a pocket full of relish 
 Jimmy Choo fetish keep me fresh like lettuce 
 Bitches get jealous 'cause I'm quite cocky 
 Since fourteen ain't nah hoes stop me 
 Money I get it, on the tracks I spit it 
 That's why the credit cards don't come with no limits 
 Y'all just don't get it, a crib with no tenets 
 Walk through closets like I'm walking outta limits 
 Now that's swagger on a hundred thousand trillion 
 Row of bad bitches and they all look Brazilian 
 These niggas can't leave me, I swear they can't leave me 
 Ass so fat and the pussy like Fiji 
 My chick bad (diamond)

 I'm the baddest chick and they don't call me that for nothing 
 Diamond princess straight VVS stuntin 
 Like grey eyes, hour glass frame 
 Still got the crown for best ass in the game 
 Hips of a Goddess, watch how I throw em 
 So good it make 'em wanna tattoo my lips on em 
 I'm so bad and I rep that hood 
 Pussy stay wet, sex so good 
 10 years strong you should act like you know me 
 Hair so fine make you do the hokey Pokey 
 A good stroke in and a good stroke out 
 Now that's what I'm all about 
 I'm the baddest

 Yeah I took a couple years off, came back still bussin' 
 Still reppin Philly still the Eve of destruction 
 Still pushing buttons that'll do away the roof 
 Still walk around with 5 thousand dollar boots 
 So when I'm in the club the chicks get jealous 
 'Cause I'm dat bitch that still keep a mean fetish 
 Still stack lettuce, still stack cheese 
 And I got a bad temper tell your nigga say please 
 Cause this is for the G's, never for the Busta's 
 So put your diamond rings on and get yourself a hustler 
 Better yet a customer, guaranteed to buy it 
 Sick from the lips, caramel wanna try it
