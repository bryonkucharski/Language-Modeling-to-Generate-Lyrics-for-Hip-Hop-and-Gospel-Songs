Keep me in the sky, that's all that I cry 
 I'll become your servant if it's worth your time 
 Keep me in the sky, that's all that I'll say 
 I'll become your soldier, at least for this day 
 Keep me in the sky, that's all that I cry 
 I'll become your servant if it's worth your time 
 Keep me in the sky, that's all that I'll say 
 I know I haven't been walking a humble path 
 I know I cursed at your name and then laughed 
 And though I found it inane to bend calf 
 The servitude of groveling framed as pained task 
 I gotta figure, it can't hurt to ask 
 Suspension of disbelief in uniquely freak flash 
 Admission of the faithfully shaken, now trapped 
 Thirty thousand and dropping, it's on and popping at last 
 Keep me in the sky, that's all that I cry 
 I'll become your servant if it's worth your time 
 Keep me in the sky, that's all that I'll say 
 I'll become your soldier, at least for this day

 Flyentology (oh god) 
 Everybody get your ticket today 
 Flyentology (oh god) 
 Welcome aboard, sir, right this way 
 Flyentology, flyen-flyentology (oh god) 
 Our bible is in your seat back pocket 
 Flyentology (oh god) 
 Tuck your head between your legs and pray 
 I adore you 
 The same way that others always adored you 
 Emergency, humility, just break glass 
 I implore you 
 With no knowledge of dogma to conform to 
 I know I don't deserve it, but, save my ass 
 And if I'm going down, let me do it in first class 
 The paganistic prayer of a heathen with wild past 
 Please forgive my bastard lifestyle- fast 
 And anoint me with salvation in the form of non-crash 
 I wanna live so bad 
 All my life, I've been so arrogant 
 This is the vessel of my 'wakening 
 Please father, put your hand out, carry me 
 I wanna live so bad 
 All my life, I've been so arrogant 
 This is the vessel of my 'wakening 
 Goddamn it, put your hand out, carry me
