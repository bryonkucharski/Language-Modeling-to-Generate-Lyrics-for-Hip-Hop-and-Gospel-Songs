El-P: "Straight up if it wasn't for cats like me 
 For real and I am not bullshittin 
 If it wasn't for cats like me you wouldn't be in the rec 
 In the door and I know that's true now knowwhatmsayin? 
 Because now you're really in some of it" 
 Sole: "Where's Len? I told Len that fuckin'; I sai {slight pause} 
 Quote, that I said, I love Company Flow 
 I don't wanna be against you guys I-I-I quote 
 Quote, unquote I said, I wanna be down - you know; 
 Like I said I don't want beef with you guys 
 YouknowIamlikedude; like fuckin' 
 This whole shit is bananas, y'know" 
 El-P: "Like you're gonna make it by dissing me 
 You know the record that got CoFlow scared, knowwhatmsayin?? 
 It's like DO I SOUND SCARED??" 
 Sole: "No I don't think you sound very scared" 
 Some cats know us but this one don't 
 I oughta pierce this fuckin' phallus through your rookie ass throat 
 Yo Duke, don't step to me until you're ripened fruit 
 I'm loopy from the invitations from funeral glue 
 Stone poems dissolve combatants via shards through 56k high speed 
 Still blitzed like relaxed I'll call geisha felatio deeds 
 Like fertilizer bombs packed in air tower compartment docks 
 Sticky fuck revolution shot - send all complaints to Rupert Murdoch 
 I'll black out in the mug of suburbanites with little stinger's crew 
 You volunteer for the draft stupid--that's on you! 
 On some upper middle class romantic notion 
 So the mortar scraps'll fly cry gates section 8 escape like Klinger do 
 The demented happy face bruised back for pussycrew packin 
 Rockin' clam diggers with cut knees in Hepatitis puddles - no vaccine 
 Plus 99% are down but you still give respect for 
 Silently questionin your direction - like Amistad passenger section 
 Gilbert Grape against Magneto odds; 
 Ultimate Break 5 versus your needle pops; 
 Davey Jones versus Goliath; 
 I'm Ed Sullivan Beatles crowd response 
 I slowed it down - try to download this gig to formatted floppy disk 
 While heads bop like epileptics sucking my dick to some off-beat shit 
 Sole: "I l-l-l-l-l-l-love Company Flow" 
 ::Scratch:: "y-y-you faggot" 
 This spoiled brat little young saga got a mommy bought my sampler tapes 
 (Sole: "I wanna be down") 
 Make sure every one sheet snippet tape flyer sticker and t-shirt 
 Got a representation of my name and face 
 I rock beats that Tina Yothers morning sickness without makeup ugly dusty 
 Fucked up four track dirty ass crack pirate radio readiness 
 Okay fella; I own my masters, lyrics, merchandise 
 Mic, turntables, style psychosis pain and penis 
 Deranged cadence kills syllable UV needles 
 Makin' gangsters in the crowd throw bottles at my people 
 We dip on life cycles few data crisp since 
 Custom Jeep Dapper Dan era in 3 fat goose 
 Swingin' discs of Tron to disembowel your village elder 
 Fuckin' sick isn't it? 
 Bucket my piss while you're at it kiss the dog dick 
 Try to act monstrous but just a Beanie Baby after my profit 
 That don't do much for hip hop - that isn't respect it's cockfondlin 
 In eighty-nine we called it tip-doggin; but you ain't know that rookie 
 Don't ever try to front like you know me or my people 
 By the way Vordul did I bite? 
 Vordul: "yeah right!--that's fantasy lie snake trife" 
 Sole: "like fuckin' - this whole shit is bananas" 
 You little lying muthafucka you know you kiss my ass 
 And then you try to ::scratch:: "change up the past" 
 Who fell into their own hari kari kit when they lied to themselves 
 Self abuse by selling lies self destructive 
 I am Captain Kirk, Spock and Lieutenant Uhura on the away team 
 You're Henson Lebowitz - the sacrificial lamb for the episode 
 You beamed to the wrong planet this time 
 With a hot pink phaser and one line 
 Before getting morphed to faggot dust for not knowing our status 
 Automatic and absolutely the poisonous shit-licking one cyber reject 
 New England rich boy soon to catch a Bay Area eject 
 Marionette pussy non-veteran 
 I got more friends than you where you live 
 (Menopause/ Men all pause) when I stop that flow of estrogen 
 You wanna be on the cutting edge--sliced up 
 Emotions knifed--life sucks 
 Feeling dejected when frustration is misdirected in official election 
 Conjections on top of blaming misinformation textures 
 So inane--I cause colon blow pain 
 You have an obsession respect it 
 From now on you're immortalized playin' yourself on my record 
 Congratu-fuckin-lations; isn't that what you wanted-- IDIOT! 
 There's more than a little difference between yours and mines existence 
 This is my ride; and you're not commandeering it 
 The only thing advanced about your music 
 Is that you need a computer to hear it 
 This year you're independent, 
 Last year you was on some keep it real shit, right? 
 The last year before that you discovered hip-hop 
 And you immediately became an internet genius 
 Facetious pseudo-intellectualism can't contest wisdom 
 I feel like Selena; the president of my fan club trying to kill me 
 And you'se a bad ass? 
 Let's take a Linda Trip file since you wanted to play the game filthy 
 Bad enough that you lied about me; 
 Front like this isn't your voice 
 I'll be forced to release the microcassette in it's entirety 
 Sole: "I mean, fuckin' Len knows, I mean... y'know I like your shit 
 You know it's not really like that y'know" 
 El-P: "I don't know that you like my shit 
 I haven't even heard your record 
 I have no idea what you think about me" 
 Sole: "I-I-I-I-I love Company Flow--I love Company Flow 
 I don't wanna be against you guys--I don't wanna be against you guys 
 I wanna be down--I-I-I-I-I wanna be down--I-I-I-I-I wanna be down 
 :: "I love Company Flow" -- (Sole's voice stretched and echoed 
 So it sounds like he's sputtering and stuttering)::: 
 This is one of those precious moments of ferocious paybacks 
 Closest to the perfect scenario you made a move but it backfired 
 Magnified by the fact that you tried to project a persona 
 Of confrontation by subverting a crew who in fact you idolized 
 Next time your delusions of groupie lust and battle fame 
 Isolated website hip-hop coast Tiger Beat subscription addiction 
 Malignancy career impotency lies high school gossip power move 
 Will simply get you beat the fuck up, liar 
 Spell my goddamn name right next time pussy 
 Feel the beauty of futulity served with arsenic cookies 
 And old lace, you tried to save facial; yo fuck that I fold space 
 You musta thought you was Canibus trying to eat my ass 
 How does the hole taste Timmy? 
 You don't even deserve this moment--do you? 
 You haven't paid enough dues to get a battle--pupil! 
 Run along and do your little interviews with your fantasy life distortion 
 Next time you reveal your true self 
 Make sure that no one records it, stupid 
 Sole: "To be totally honest with you--I think your being cool, y'know 
 Like; I mean, taking in consideration everything--y'know" 
 El-P: "Yaknahmsayin my plan was especially to ignore you, but like, 
 Now it's gettin' very difficult to do that because you're makin' too... 
 You're makin' too big a deal, out of what you perceive as a diss to you; 
 When in reality like, I don't think you're completely 
 Positive that you're totally correct on this one" 
 Sole: "Uh, I don't feel very correct right now; at this point 
 That's why I don't really have anything to say because it's like 
 Well fuck, you know I made I made my El-P diss record already y'know?" 
 ::Scratching::: 
 Damn that's a sucka---faggot----Get played, out of position 
 ---True feelings---m-m-murder a rookie---- 
 Suck the dick kid and eat the dick cookie---- 
 E-e-e-at the dick cookie
