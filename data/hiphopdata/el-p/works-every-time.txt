[Verse Annotate1]: 
 I've been waiting for you all week 
 Don't you know this a rotten time to not not be me 
 I've been waiting for an hour now, what the fuck is up? 
 I've got memories to lose man. I am in a rush 
 Don't make me suffer this dimension straight 
 When we can bend face. Let space pixelate 
 60 dollars for a new born you. 
 Pay no attention to these savages: they don't own truth 
 Pay no attention to the man behind the glassy smirk 
 I tried it your way, that advice you gave to me was dirt 
 Twenty-five and I can buy my way of planet nerf 
 Where the softest hearts are tossed around on astro turf 
 Charlie Brown's adult voice trumpets fade 
 And its ridiculous to say oblivions insane 
 And its insanity to think I'd recognize my name 
 I no longer speak the language, I have chosen change 
 It's like a fresh start to a new world (And I'd do anything, anything anything) 
 To go home 
 It's like a fresh start to a new world 
 And I already want to go home 
 Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue 
 If I exist right now I damn sure can't provide you proof 
 Definitions of existence in this state are loose 
 You've done enough, relax, I'll finish tightening up my noose 
 You had the fucking nerve to outstretch claw and point at me 
 But can't you tell by how I'm sweating I am finally free 
 You were right about me, all along, whoop-de-doo 
 Leave a message, I have disappeared and so have you
