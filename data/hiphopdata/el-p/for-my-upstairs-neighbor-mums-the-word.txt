(Verse 1: El-P) 
 I'd like some water please 
 This room is way too hot to be here sitting and explaining 
 There's no joy in repetition 
 Plus you all know what I know 
 And that's a heaping pile of donut holes 
 I didn't even know them 
 I am not your perfect witness 
 Your team of fat blue buddies waddling around 
 And trying to crack the case 
 Are better off locating someone else 
 I spent a day on my New York shit 
 Didn't even meet them once 
 And I am not upset I'm just another guy minding his business 
 But if I had to guess I'd say whatever happened 
 Probably had to happen anyway 
 If crime's a definition do your job and write it up 
 But find another motherfucker to harass 
 I'm getting tired of this redundancy rendition 
 Come on, you know the drill, these walls are thick 
 I got my own shit that I'm dealing with 
 I haven't seen or heard a thing 
 I never met 'em, that's the city 
 Good luck working it Columbo! 
 I'mma bounce, you got my info 
 But you'll never get my pity and I'm out 
 If you kill him I won't tell (4x) 
 (Verse 2: El-P) 
 Earlier that day after my regular alarm 
 Of tongue-as-blade that resonated clear through thin-constructed walls 
 After my first smoke but before I cop the paper from bodega 
 Bumped into you in the stairwell in our shit-constructed hall 
 On my New York shit as the customary bop 
 Don't talk to anyone, look forward, mind yourself, continue walk 
 The halls are thin and so is skin 
 When bearing witness to the sound you're generating everyday 
 Guess it reminded me of something 
 It must have taken every muscle in your body 
 To produce that little twitch you probably thought was passing muster 
 For a smile, but trust I recognize the gesture 
 I have seen it many times 
 I read the tells, I know the sacred art of bluffing 
 Maybe I shouldn't have 
 But as you passed I stopped and put my hand on your left arm 
 And we both paused, I meant no harm 
 And you look startled as I leaned into your ear 
 And said the first and last thing ever to you 
 "Do the thing you have to and I swear I'll tell them nothing." 
 If you kill him I won't tell (4x)
