They wanna kill you, you're the cancer, you're the fucking problem 
 You're the pollution, you're the issue, and they wanna solve it 
 They wanna cure you, you're the cancer, how's that make you feel? 
 I should have stayed asleep, waking up can get you killed 
 Hope in the throws, cope or choke on a hose 
 Pokers roast in the coals, misanthropic and cold 
 (In the world) 
 In a bug's life scurry under scope with the mold 
 Hold position or fold, no intermission it rolls 
 (In the world) 
 On and on and on and off we just unos and o's froze 
 Petrified living hidden sowed in the code 
 (In the world) 
 The longest walk off the plank that's ever ranked in your soul 
 This is not what you chose, case open and closed 
 (In the world) 
 Stuck on mega lit blocks, feathered tarred and detoxed 
 From the sox to the cockler tied up tethered and boxed 
 Just a Helena with legs, framing the painting of dregs 
 Fuck your complaining I'm fresh 
 I'm tainted pain in the flesh 
 I'll see you 
 Spit with an illy alien flex, 3 titty'd martian attacks 
 That ugly grey riding a huffy over city with friends 
 (In the world) 
 Live wrong and prosper's the mantra they try to drill in the head 
 4 out of 5 babies in graves agree the scene is of dread 
 (In the world) 
 Seemingly seams that were woven have ripped, threaded but slipped 
 Like Charlie O kilo echo sniffing dripping out red 
 (In the world) 
 Shoot for the stars hit the roof, jump for the shark get a tooth 
 Reach for the flowers get thorny, warning their powers in bloom 
 (In the world) 
 Pardon the fuzz I'm distorted, contorted, pardon the hiss 
 Don't let them Henson me, enter me and control how I twitch 
 They say the holiest shit until flames around them get lit 
 Then costanza the crowd of children... kick a baby to live 
 I'll see you
