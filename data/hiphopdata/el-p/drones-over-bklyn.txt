You bAnnotateetter stay aloof when the troops move or suicide booths soothe 
 The who's who of looters shoot, the bullets go zoom zoom 
 Your pain is the porn, pal, they pay to pop plain shit 
 It's faded, it's more foul than famous, it's hot sin 
 Hollywood off the bus fucked, tender little destruct tucked 
 In the waist with a gold face, feed the greedy with dum dums 
 You and me in the butane, supe a lame and he puffs up 
 Little dragons of fad rap, suture their face the fuck up 
 Walk in the zone or get less, wake in the fog of fright night 
 Eat where the sifters sell trash, sleep where the orphan's hell hatched 
 Pardon me son I'm zoned out, cloned out 
 No doubt home is, blowed out 
 Sold out without extra man bonus 
 Tragedy smurf smirks, a middle man's shirt bursts 
 Wetted up, wet work, you get it up, get merc'd 
 A wabbit in crosshairs, mechanical fox hunt 
 Be quiet they're hunting now, the method is awesome 
 And I can see them in my eyes when they're closed, I can feel them at night 
 I can feel them plot a course through the sky, I believe in their flight 
 Drones over Brooklyn 
 Dr-Drones over Brooklyn

 You can hear calico ultimate point at you 
 Click clack and back 'em to bunny dust point of view 
 Hardy har, funny stuff, tough cookie boy 
 I'll be sure to bring my bitch-bib-sloppy-eat-flop-around-clown-shoe getup 
 Kids sing along, this is all we have left bitch, sing a song 
 I was born conjoined to howlers of the siren age 
 Lion cage meat life sacrifice, nothing left 
 Tell me if it matters that I sing it wrong 
 Another DJ yells "Lick the balls" 
 Another Brooklyn kite delivered in his crooked paws 
 I'd sooner wash my dick in acid than ask what you think 
 I'll fuck myself with a stun gun before gassing your team 
 You patch me in and I'll dumb out with a channeled disease 
 It sucks to be nothing, nobody struts when they're down on their knees 
 This whole rackets for the bees, fuck my life already 
 Fuck the law, fuck the sun, say goodnight already 
 You fucking spam-bots selling shit, all right already 
 We get it you getting that fetti, oh Jesus Christ already 
 And I can see them in my eyes when they're closed, I can feel them at night 
 I can feel them plot a course through the sky, I believe in their flight 
 Drones over Brooklyn 
 Dr-Drones over Brooklyn
