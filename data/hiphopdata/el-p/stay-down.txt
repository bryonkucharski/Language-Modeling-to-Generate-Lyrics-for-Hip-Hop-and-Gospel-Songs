You know I get down, I'm a downer, heart pounder, LOLin', smelling like Sarin 
 Felony forecast: el is, dressed to the nines like a target, dressed like a bullseye for a blind archer 
 Heart of a piranha, swimming where the blood chums water 
 Lark in the darkness watching, I got it this, boombox burner boy hot shit 
 Burn like an LA sunset, colorful, toxic, snuff stuff, deadly and erotic 
 Walk like a man not a product, run like a strumpet, talk to the hand sock puppet 
 Look at them sky write: "fuck it, we heart nothin', we don't have a tear for your bucket", life's but a pageant, that ain't on no deep shit, try to pull the curtain back crack goes police whip 
 Here come the stage mums, dress your little whores to display them, cutting through my brain like a ray gun 
 Telling you these fuckers are shameless, Obama to Reagan, look at how they bent to their training 
 Why would I be angered, not when I can chemically hang glide, angle, face dive mangled, anguish 
 Notice I maraud odd language, roll a joint 
 Hit a fraud god till he vanquish, bonus point 
 I'm thrown 
 With all this chrome and 
 You sound like you're drowning 
 Drown drown drown drown 
 Get down, stay down 
 You know I get bent I'm a Bender, Futura-Ra-ma-Dom-inant gene gone bad and 
 Passed along to my blood stream pumping madness, pour a little hell down hatch it's 
 Standard practice how to detach from a white noise planet with a dispatch straight from command to throw haymaker plus land it, never take a win for granted 
 Remember the pitch that I sang with, to anoint masses, before, mass graves hatch like magic, everybody bows to the bastards, anthem acid dispatchers get rancid, fact of the matter I graph and track hapless, live in a mirage its hard to not crack kid 
 What's that? pass it 
 Wanna watch? I'mma smoke till I'm bat shit 
 Choke like a champion
