Still in Brooklyn 
 Lullabies chime crooked 
 For the harrowed and the shook-en 
 Back to dose me 
 Back to hold the high closely 
 For the sparrows and the butchers 
 See the blood moon hunters moon hear the howling 
 For the habit and the hammered and the cowering 
 In the magic with the haunted and the doubted 
 There are ghosts here 
 There's a presence there's a power 
 For the tightrope over tank with the piranhas 
 For the frazzled it's a moment it's a promise 
 To be broke down to be lowdown to be honest 
 Another showdown with the woozy and the conscious 
 For the aggy with the baggy with the bottle 
 With a smile with a sip with a swallow 
 And don't you ever try to say that you're not one of us, my love 
 We are the touched 
 We are entrusted with the same tomorrow 
 (Till I get there) 
 I'm still living like a four dollar vic. (Jumping off the world) 
 (Till I get there) 
 A lot of trouble four a little bit of win. (Jumping off the world) 
 (Until I get there) 
 In the gasoline and sulfur in the sin. (Jumping off the world) 
 (Until I get there) 
 You cannot throw me in the briar patch, bitch 
 That is where I live 
 (Jumping off the world) 
 This album is dedicated to Camu Tao 
 And this goes out to the... 
 To the maniacs 
 And aristocrat grifters 
 To the zealots 
 To the monarchs 
 What up brainiacs? 
 Compulsively acidic rainiacs 
 Repulsively predictable painiacs 
 To the liars 
 For the devils night fires 
 Same to you too town cryer 
 Top O'the morning morbid 
 Quite a day we're having gorgeous 
 Salutations unimportant 
 Hello uninspired 
 I thought I'd drop on by and wish you all the luck desired 
 I wish you all the souls your little mouth can tuck inside 
 You'll always be that special part of me 
 That loves to dine on grinning void 
 So flirty touches dizzy lust I must imbibe 
 And what a team we made 
 There's nothing we can't justify 
 But I am the son disgust entrusted with the undefined 
 And I can no longer contain what's under my disguise 
 I've always had the cancer for the cure 
 That's what the fuck am I 
 (Outro/FTL (Me and You)) 
 I know there's 
 Something good that I'd die here for 
 Something great that I'd live here for 
 Something fly that I'd write for you 
 Something wrong that I'd bite you for 
 Something sick that you'd cure me of 
 Something said to make sure you're loved 
 Some of us cannot trust no one 
 Some of us don't deserve no trust 
 Nothing wrong with not being strong 
 Nothing says we need to beat what's wrong 
 Nothing manmade remains made long 
 That's a debt we can't back out of 
 Nothing that they can take from you 
 Nothing that they can do to me 
 Nothing I wouldn't do for you 
 Nothing left here but you and me 
 There's nothing they would do for you, differently 
 They're not even listening 
 They don't even glean what we're existing in 
 There's nothing here but love and you 
 Groveling, look what they're accomplishing 
 The systematic gods have all demolished it 
 But I've never felt so brave 
 As when I'm looking at your face 
 They can decimate my body 
 But my heart will not disgrace 
 They can torture and interrogate 
 And shackle to my boot 
 I will gnaw off my own leg 
 And hop the fuck right back to you
