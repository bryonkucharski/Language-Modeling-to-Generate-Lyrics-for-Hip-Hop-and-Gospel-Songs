(Burrrrp) Oh, yeah, oh, you son of a bitches 
 (It gets so fuckin' crabby in this booth, man) 
 (It's like 90 degrees in here) 
 (Smells like Satan's toilet)

 Building tomorrow's fathers today 
 Spilling the leftovers of creational clay 
 We grew with the concept now we're ready to go public 
 Today's a big day for the company 
 A big step for the little-steppers who slept for years uncomfortably 
 Little man, little lady, cute little baby 
 Reach your hand out to the future of automated robotics 
 On display here for the first time in (enter year here) 
 At the World's fair - but is it really? 
 Ladies and Gentlemen I propose that the market is sinking 
 Under the weight of useless contraptions added to the shopping carts of all hard-working families 
 Electric doodads and wizard hats and such to keep the munchkins entertained 
 But get replaced by newer versions or just breakdown systematically 
 Mothers - how many times have you debated self-euthanasia tablets for breakfast snacks 
 When restlessness attacks seemingly at random? 
 With an emptiness inside that's hard to identify, maybe 
 Pursuing habits like pill-popping and constant overeating? 
 Chances are you've been abandoned 
 Well I'm no scientist, that's not what I went to school for 
 And I'm not a doctor, so I don't know much about medicine 
 But I'm willing to bet that you, yes you little 
 What's your name sweetheart? (wawa) yeah, whatever 
 Get a funny feeling in your tummy when you see mommy cry 
 Something between woozy and confusion 
 And you spend your thoughts on how the sadness 
 In your mommy can be rooted out, burned, scorned, turned out, forgotten 
 So you can concentrate on candy and little baby dolls or 
 Whatever it is that normal kids get to think about 
 Well I can honestly say that this invention is, 
 Let me start by saying we've grafted only the finest of, 
 Inserted the most high tech, state of the art, with brain charted for authentic 
 True to human emotion and trained to be domestic 
 Made from the most easily available materials and, uh, loosely inspected 
 Guaranteed to revolutionize 
 Perfectly realistic and even somewhat institutionally respected 
 Robotic relative

 I'm not only the president, I'm a client 
 So you purchased a paternal unit, class A type 1 
 A new addition to your living room space, watch it go 
 Under warranty for at least 90 days, so have fun 
 If in that time frame there's a problem, please let us know 
 Before you start there's a few details that you must learn 
 Technical specs about your unit to make things run smooth 
 In an effort to find an energy source our company's learned 
 The cheapest way to keep his battery running is with booze 
 Plug it in, give it a name, man of the house, help sustain 
 Wear the pants, you can relax, one of the pack, nuclear fam (literally nuclear) 
 Brings us to the safety chapter 
 Section 87 in your handbook subsection 16 entitled 
 Troubleshooting 
 Fuel sources are at a slight risk of mixing 
 With the crispy plutonium center 
 Of your automated new spouse and then driven 
 Possibly leading to the unpredicted stimulation of its artificial emotion circuits 
 And in a few unsubstantiated clinical trials this condition 
 Has led to simulated feelings of resentment and worthlessness 
 Manifested in the highly unlikely but still possible act 
 Of physical aggression towards you and your loved ones fleshy surfaces 
 Remember, no cash returns 
 Only credits towards future purchases
