(Now the evening has come to a close 
 And I've had my last dance with you 
 So on to the empty streets with me 
 And it might be my last chance with you 
 So I might as well get it over with 
 The things I have to say 
 Won't wait until another day) 
 Shut up 
 Whoooooo 
 Whoooooo 
 Whoooooo 
 Check this out 
 The Fabulous structure that's coaxed out of rubbles puddles splash 
 Mechanisms burn with beeping sounds that own their humans sold as 
 Ruthless rounds of radio dust, Cranial mush, men get flattened out 
 Radials spun on dusted combatant joust 
 After house of the dead heads fled, it's just the city moans 
 Malignant kid in it with sentence of sinister conferred 
 Magna-funk asbestos, the best at closed-quarters shit 
 Some will gravitate to the falcon and burn in wordlessness 
 Hangin' with the herd is my joy 
 We buoy ordertake employ 
 When the farmers feed the murder rate ploy 
 We stow collected rebel factions in dirt and just follow 
 The citizens all love to be loved, we just follow 
 Figure they ate the kids, homey 
 So fuck 'em save the adults 
 Kids are patriotic, robotic, operate catapults 
 And goose-step over innocence 
 Vagrant of Reaganomics phasing 
 Read the books that will burn at the barn raising 
 (Independent like a fuck) (Oh, Jesus) 
 You misinterpreted that Funcrush shit 
 So man, funcrush this 
 Spectacular dawning of the herd-thinner faction where distraction is bliss 
 Tyrell took a sabatical but back for the new semester (rockin' that) 
 Class action suit from the Laundromat of velour and pressed polyester 
 American history exo-bytes cypher with the tainted offspring, gimme no-doz quick 
 You need to haul that mega-dumb style to the antique roadshow, bitch 
 The system bleeds for the radio angry, rock that wound aesthetic 
 The name of this routine is live at man you just don't get it 
 Please try to compartmentalize my dick 
 With a little bit a that bitch hubris 
 When the ritalin starts to fade I might get lucid 
 Every mindfuck I handout comes with a free month of internet access 
 And an updated year 2003 version of the mega clapper (you know the drill, clap off) 
 This is the third installment of a prequel that was never written right 
 Filmed with that classic Brooklyn magic, without Lucasarts graphics 
 Rendered cuddly comic relief creatures or terrible child actors 
 Get off that jade elephant, you're stoned, and remember everything backwards
