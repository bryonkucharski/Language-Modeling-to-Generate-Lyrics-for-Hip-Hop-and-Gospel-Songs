(El-P) 
 I became toxic allotted in badly shaded cement fuselages 
 Of juvenile non-approval and loosely smoker's school cut abandonment 
 Where great expected movement tossed itself to the brain otters and shakily 
 Faded in my timeline to something honestly hard to stand 
 (If that's not a booby trap) I would muse, stepping on Nike Uptown abuse 
 Yeah the darkest blue swoosh and cathartic ruse faction of, a B-Boy enacted 
 As truly city all-bomber and my thoughts followed the color chart on the 
 A-train country, hovering under the A-Frame structures bloody 
 And if I closed my optics I could trace the lines lovely they said: You'll 
 Start your life between pause tape slices and muddy 
 Kicks that lick the salt off your neck 
 And its more than apparent your portable parent with the 
 Built-in mic might like sinister syllable smart tongue more than your 
 Teachers do, that's two schools booted from on some dumb shit 
 Young menace, get the message, bad medicine, restless, sad jettison rejection 
 Had to endith the lesson 
 I used to do an impression of Buff after lunch outside the cage, making faces 
 Kelley green with envy grimace, that's my gimmick 
 Went with truancy and the bad apple, and it slowly formed my spirit 
 So when I couldn't fit the scholastic structure of my peers I didn't fear it 
 (And it was) air brush on the pants leg and, name cut in the back of the head and 
 Cipher in the subway without money in my pocket then 
 Recognize this is the new truth, we refuse to suckle the empires ruse 
 Original box-cutter walker who talk to rebuild a new living proof 
 See me as a banshee, as the illest motherfucker since Oedipus 
 Monkey number one million with a typewriter, flipping tempest text 
 Left evidence, simple-headed vagrants try to chase where Forest's feather went 
 Darts exit us, and still leave enough alive to join the exodus 
 Fresh as fuck, best of luck, better lead banality rally quest 
 Stuck writer might flip, vvvvvroooom! Excitebike bitch 
 Enter the hellafied Fat-Boys-slash-BDP hybrid founder of 
 Militant anti-mime fraction, operate on the fringes of establishment 
 Binge on erratic shit, fabric knit, got you riverdancing in lederhosen for woodchips 
 Step into the Def Jux office auditions like: "sausage" 
 Jam Master Jay would've shot you (I stopped him) 
 Sorcerer, nitroglycerin in truck driving through rainforest unstable 
 Rawkus was like, "we're gonna take this label to another level" 
 (Fuck that) I'm gonna take this level to another label 
 Anti-pop composer, sonically robbing the nation 
 When I strap on a blue cardigan we can be neighbors (do lasers) 
 Water douse fire now, fire bad, fire blank at bastard Bladerunner bliss 
 Shotgiven (miss), another bargain bin opportunity moment clipped 
 I was a B-Boy once, I really gave a fuck (still do) 
 When you were trading episodes at laser tag academy I was applying 
 For most sinister mister brainfuck crown confront 
 The loudest son of the transistor rubble box 
 Damage and shit like open-handed palm brandishing 
 Letting the hurt live where it landed... Like that 
 This is for New Jacks trying to decide where they fit (get busy) 
 Destroy the walls when you spit 
 For writers with a Krylon image brain print (translate it) 
 Leave your name dripping from bricks 
 For cats who covet fame with my name on their lips (re-think it) 
 You're sucking poison milk from fake tits 
 This is for kids worried about the apocalypse (do something) 
 Prepare yourself and stop talking shit
