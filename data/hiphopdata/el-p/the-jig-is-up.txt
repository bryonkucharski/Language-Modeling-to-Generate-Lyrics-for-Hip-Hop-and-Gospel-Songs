Tell me who sent you here, what agency 
 Who's paying for this time you're wasting? 
 Who signs when you submit receipts? 
 What do they have on you to bribe you? 
 What's the threat they held above that very pleasing face? 
 What do they want from me? 
 As for that shed of tools we spoke about 
 I doubt that I'm the sharpest one 
 But manuals I come with clearly read "I cut" 
 So you're not fooling anybody 
 We all know that you couldn't be here out of love 
 You must really think that I am dumb 
 Well, I know a thing or two about a thing or two 
 And one of them's the fact that men like me don't ever get no second chance 
 Not for the kind of man who showed up at death's door 
 And ding, dong, dashed so much he wore a hole out on the welcome mat 
 Oh you're good 
 The way you just smiled at me; pro move 
 A lesser man would fall for that 
 Just drift into the thrill of you 
 Why don't you just admit the truth 
 That you've been trained to withstand pain 
 And that's the only way my crazy is not killing you 
 Look at me 
 I'm on to you 
 No more lies 
 I'm on to you 
 Then again, you might out of your goddamn mind 
 I wouldn't want to be part of any club that would have me (4x) 
 You must be out of your goddamn mind 
 Tell me your real name, who's your leader 
 What agenda got you slumming it down here 
 Who's handing out the dough? 
 Tell me the point of adopting a crocodile 
 When you know that he's going to be flushed to the sewers down low 
 Slithering, writhing, wiggling 
 Living where the moon don't glow 
 Why would you book a ticket with a living Costa Concordia? 
 Why would you travel on a vessel that might not float? 
 For all the times that I drowned out hope 
 I don't really see the logic of me getting this spot on the lifeboat 
 Got to be a better candidate 
 For that sheer dumb luck 
 No comprendo
