Girlfriend: What are you thinking right now? 
 El: I would really prefer not to tell you what's going on in my head right now. 
 Girlfriend: I really wanna know. I'm not gonna hold it against you. I promise. I'm a big girl-I can handle it. Just tell me what's going on in your head... 
 ("The Twilight Zone": Mr. Chambers, don't get on that ship! The rest of the book "To Serve Man," it's... it's a cookbook!) 
 That's not a hand it's a claw, and this is not a song it's an exorcism of numbness, 
 We are not in my bedroom anymore, it's a prison camp that I've been stuck in 
 This isn't skin, it's a scramble suit with a thousand me's rotating, 
 That's not your mouth, it's a boredom generator powered by irritation, 
 We aren't a couple, we're isolationists who tried to use the buddy system 
 And that wasn't sex, it was a competition for power that I'm clearly winning 
 But that's not victory, matter fact I think I'm better off forfeiting, 
 You go for de gold girl, I'm about to bounce out deadwoods hills for cleaner living 
 And I really do... 
 Hope it all works out like you want it to 
 I hope it all works out like you want it to 
 I hope it all works out like you want it to 
 I hope it all works out like you want 
 This isn't Brooklyn, it's a colony of wayward bees without a queen 
 And we aren't people, more like Sims controlled by childish deities, 
 But see we're alive now, and that's not time we're wasting nah this is life 
 And you're so pretty, like the gleam off that blade when you slipped my ribs the shivy, 
 This ain't a breakup, I like to think of it as a... stay of execution, 
 And that's not the air I'm clearing, it's the wispy trails of our cumulus pollution, 
 And that's not despair you're feeling, it's the petulant reaction of a wounded child 
 And that's not the door I'm looking at, it's an escape hatch to this zeppelin we're inside 
 And I really do... 
 Hope it all works out like you want it to 
 I hope it all works out like you want it to 
 I hope it all works out like you want it to 
 I hope it all works out like you want 
 You're not a woman you're a piranha with cutlery for dentured up smile 
 And I'm not a man, I'm an incomplete punchline of a joke I don't understand, 
 That's not your diary, it's a cookbook and I'm you're favorite chapter when you're bored 
 And that's not a love letter, it's a recipe for the same slop you served before 
 This ain't an insult, it's the clearest truth I've ever had the misery to speak 
 But these aren't words, these are the terms of my surrender and defeat 
 But I'm not sorry, beyond the sorry nature of existing with no plans, 
 Please don't touch me. Just wave goodbye with that claw that's not a hand. 
 Did I mention that I... 
 Hope it all works out like you want it to 
 I hope it all works out like you want it to 
 I hope it all works out like you want it to 
 I hope it all works out like you want 
 (X3) Really do... 
 Hope it all works out like you want it to 
 I hope it all works out like you want it to 
 I hope it all works out like you want it to 
 I hope it all works out like you want 
 (X8) Really do...
