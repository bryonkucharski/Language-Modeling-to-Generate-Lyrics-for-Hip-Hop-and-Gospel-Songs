Intro (William S. Burroughs): 
 This is war to extermination 
 Fight cell by cell through bodies and mind screens of the Earth 
 Souls rotten from the orgasm drug 
 Flesh shuddering from the ovens 
 Prisoners of the Earth, come out 
 Storm the studio 
 Live on a hot metal big-burner Bunsen 
 Combustion or something and so on, fuck it 
 See how the wrong side of tracks 
 Made the dusted-est trash that intellect 
 Dash to the wormhole, talk shit 
 Walk with a holy hawk raised 
 In a dog shit, bitch, click chatter box, duck 
 I'm a "holy fuck, what did he just utter?" marksman 
 Orphan, a whore-born, war-torn life for the harvest 
 A fair-trade target of air raid, starter kit 
 Used heart plucked from the bargain bin 
 I don't give a fraction of fractal of fucks 
 I'm a Garbage Pail Kid calamity artist 
 Pardon the pain puffs, smoke float ring 
 Around martyrs, sing along, sat at piano 
 Lap of my father, watching him talk harmonic 
 Each key tapped to the BPM of the sirens 
 Sound like a raining of notes in a protest pose 
 Like a right string weaved on the keys 
 Could relieve us of doom 
 Give the room some silence, stop violence 
 Pop bounced and a mom with her three survivors 
 Got gone from the island, hopped to the 
 County of kings where the bounty of things 
 Not framed in past might last 'til the hatching 
 Of manhood's timing, hop in the timeline 
 See the turnstile young hopper, not for the rock 
 For the talk good science alliance 
 Drunk and defiant, sunset started up all night 
 Crawl through the cracks in the halls 
 Of the battered-up, scattered-up 
 Middle finger, dick held, brick kids 
 Screaming at the top of our airbags 
 "This is our timing, we are not dying" 
 Not for you, not for you (7x) 
 Not for you, not, not, not for you
