So you should pump this shit like they do in the future 
 Got a strain un-contained that could turn parade zombie 
 Walk with an army on me, stalked by the harm and armor posse 
 Prolly got me on a radar with a dot 
 These watching, plotting minions of the lower God scene 
 Shit hawks abound, in the town of bullet dodging 
 I'm a Rocky, run a hundred a mile before my coffee 
 Shitty little sick kid, the Gipper's hitting for dolo, now I'm rarefied 
 Signal lit verified bossy 
 Fuck your droid noise, Voyboy's Noid ploy 
 Oi oi, I'll rugby-kick the shit out your groin, boy 
 Oi vey, the slayers of your harmony porn life 
 Throat fuck your lucky day, the flight of a torn kite 
 Holy smokes, city blown to the bone the death server 
 Fit a hearse with a burner, whip to the church of a murder sermon 
 Just a Cassandra too drained to painfully word it further 
 Future of a gerbil up ass of masochist, that's my word up 
 Pump this shit 
 In your floating whip system 
 Pump this shit 
 In the bread line, the prison 
 Pump this shit 
 From the chip under your wrist skin 
 (You are so fucking paranoid) 
 I am Sam, I am known to go HAM, the full retard 
 Playing taps on a keytar, in the Benz or the Beamer 
 Either, etherlicious or rebel yelling anathema 
 Son of forgotten freedom, rebel ¡Arriba 'riba! 
 Metal and man have melted, settle in to the FEMA, dreamer 
 Your polluted house speaker, leader 
 Yes indeed a, dawn of the dirt and doom draws nearer 
 Here's a mirror mirror to peer, fear grows clearer 
 Steer a path away from the panic of our era 
 Pyramided ocular, unlided insignia 
 Weirder here's another burner born and big in ya 
 Sector, rectified and fly sound selector 
 I'm a fucking ill, trill, kill at will etc 
 BK to the basic DNA math measurer 
 Better leave the lion alone do not pet him 
 He'll fuck-start your burp hole, jet in burgundy pleather 
 Whoa 
 Where harmony and love reign 
 No longer do we live in a society bent on its own destruction 
 Children of every race, creed and religion frolic through fields 
 Of golden dandelions 
 Lil bitch 
 That's some Camu shit 
 Those who know, lust. Trust: the flow is disgust, touch 
 Producto back rap rush, you'll notice the lad crush 
 I'm potent, intact, a black-hearted and lunged-up 
 Tarded and touched, plus designer of funk rust 
 Oh, El is back on that shit, huh? 
 That Paincave Kid talk, at the end of the painbow, the permanent stain bop 
 Maligning my name will holy ark up your squad's face 
 Viewers of the divine rage learn to worship the hard way 
 You get it? I don't fade, just float where the poem slays 
 At home with a roach hazed, alone or with hoes great 
 I called but got a tone: better boat out the borough posthaste
