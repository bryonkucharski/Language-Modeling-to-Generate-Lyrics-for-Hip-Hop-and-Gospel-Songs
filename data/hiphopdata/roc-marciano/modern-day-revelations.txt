To the game apply pressure, divide pepper 
 Design leathers, we fly forever 
 Fuck the water, we surfin' on the crowd 
 Me I like my music loud (turn me up man) 
 Step out the bath after two women wash me 
 The polo robe is costly, even the tush got a horsey 
 The 525 is saucy 
 Smokin' the moss on the porch, we 
 Steamin' drama like a dumpling 
 Break the general's torso, only the lord knows 
 Right through the stomach where the frame of the sword go 
 I'm on the coast with some cargo shorts on 
 Ride slow, eyes slow, 5-0 
 On the creep you should see the way I slide though 
 Just like the kids in the park, my vision is sharp 
 The pigeon was carte blanche, the sauce a smidgen tart 
 Toss a javelin, torch the lavender 
 I'm fucking stunning bitches weak like a calendar 
 I'm Jean-Claude Van Damme and you the challenger 
 And this the Kumite, now what you do today? 
 From my room along the vert to the terrace where I step 
 Where my maiden lay awaitin' me to pleasure me with flesh 
 Live the rest of my days atop a mountain 
 Everything is free-range, piranha in the fountain 
 Burn a carcass, walk across carnage 
 Sport the garments that crawled out of the forest 
 My shoes retarded, you'll be disregarded 
 The black-hearted 
 I laughed as the Harlot's pussy farted 
 The crabs dipped in garlic 
 The car seats is whatchamacallit 
 Steer the ship through frigid waters 
 Lift the portrait, for real I feel insulted 
 I should be sculpted 
 My bitch is cultured, six coasted 
 We sue the beast, true beef 
 The loot increase, I dip with two G's smooth as a priest 
 The older ladies scream preach, my gun was in reach 
 We run the streets, rock fleece and bubble geese 
 Crush the zanny in the L, sip the Champale 
 Now I parallel, my skin complexion caramel 
 Hopped on the saddle rang the cattle bell, the battle was hell 
 The crack and heroin's for sale 
 The blacker cell, attract quail, I cast a spell 
 Flash jasper, tip the pastor, finished the chapter 
 Showered in fur like I'm a viking 
 My resemblance is striking 
 Bite bison and cake icing 
 Crackin' crustaceans, tenacious (crab) 
 A no rest haven, dressed with the apron 
 Undressin' Asians at the basin 
 Degredation, these are modern day revelations
