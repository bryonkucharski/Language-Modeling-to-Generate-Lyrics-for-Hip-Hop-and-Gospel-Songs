Scheming on a watch 
 Dreaming on a yacht 
 Background sounds of ones jingling from out the slot 
 Thinking on a plot 
 Drown my face until the bar close 
 Two months late on the rent plus the car note 
 We all purchase 
 Man without a purpose 
 Wood circle wrapped in velvet 
 While I watch the chips slide across the surface 
 Cards on the table watch the facial expressions 
 Turning nervous 
 All I want is a taste 
 Got dealt a nine and doubled down 
 All I need is an Ace 
 Seem like the bottom of the bucket is my home base 
 Born to lose while I watch the work circling the room 
 Bitches pass, I get a whiff of the perfume 
 It's like I'm laying with my back on the street 
 A little money get me back on my feet 
 Sit at the table put me back on my seat 
 Digging in my pocket all I felt was my jeans 
 How I paint it 
 Dim light, dark pic 
 I was slumming and my love is tainted 
 The edge is rough and covered up when I frame it 
 Base it I called it dream and others chase it 
 It's a pine box and nine lives crossed up like weed strands 
 Crossed like cross hairs 
 Cost, his keys paid 
 Special ops on the scene he's a bee? 
 Attach the honey keep my money in the briefcase 
 With not a comp for me that's nothing when I'm easing to get lost 
 The seasons nothing when I'm feeling grim 
 Peep as they dealing him 
 Knowing I am not yet boss 
 It's a ceiling I do not get 
 Often when it adds up 
 Coughing when they roll the dice 
 I am bad luck 
 In Vegas too playing Miles Davis Bitches Brew 
 Same day but the wish is new 
 Life of a gambler 
 I play my hand with candor 
 Tip the vic dancer 
 Lit the cancer 
 Kiss the tarantula 
 Switch the pamper 
 It's banter 
 Glitz and glamour 
 Whip the Fisher 
 No need to shift the Phantom 
 The tandem 
 Male enhancement 
 The sex is tantric 
 Perfect the gambit 
 Protect the King 
 Play the harem 
 It's heaven 
 Roll the seven with discretion 
 Impressive 
 The necklace 
 Make the peasant toss the lettuce with the French Dressing 
 (I walked in the Casino) 
 To add the jet to the collection 
 Fresh glass of nectar the refreshment 
 Popped a mescaline in like a breath mint 
 Benevolence 
 Diamond elements 
 Million dollar rhetoric 
 Remy Martin spill on the carpet 
 Twist pelicans in crisp garments 
 Triple lemons, Prince charming 
 The fire army discharges 
 I pay the lawyer, beat the charges 
 The energy is harnessed 
 Regardless
