Chewbacca! 
 Duece-duece, Papa now rocking your shoes proper 
 True shotta, nigga you noose [knows] nada 
 My three vs. your four, who crew's hotter? 
 Random! 
 Everybody on my team is winners 
 Everybody on your team beginners 
 Why you do that, rapper? Fucking new-jack rappers 
 Flinch when I walk by 'cause I do smack rappers 
 Sean the Barbarian 
 Deadly dose of the dope shit, black tar heroine 
 The best out, bar-for-bar, Paw 
 His god given talent scream "Al hum du'Allah" 
 You got no skills (skills) you got no talent (talent) 
 You're shit no frills and your bitch toss salad 
 Niggas rap albums sound like love letters 
 Pen in my hand like 'Damn, fam, I can do much better' 
 I write classics, you can't hack it 
 You know what it is, in the room with the floor covered in plastic 
 Passive, never got a street-cat pay so I'm active 
 Stay back, I keep that blade 
 'Hi, hater' 
 I'll carve a smile right next to your frown like "Laugh Now, Cry Later" 
 Potato on the barrel French-fry ten guys 
 For major violations, call it annihilation 
 Your tough talk, I don't get it 
 You wouldn't fight a ticket, so why recite a lyric? 
 Especially when lyrics get a rifle at your fitted 
 I'm sure the buck so, tell Pac "What up though?" 
 My fours better be real 
 You wanna be tough? All right, you'll forever be steel 
 Still, I get nicer yet out-ice ya' 
 And rhyme with the force of a Jedi cyhper 
 Marcberg, baby fire it off 
 Split your cabbage, bitch ass rappers spit garish 
 Live lavish, Mac-10's under big jackets 
 Hit me a pass, flip that mattress 
 Remember the patterns, the five stay dipping in traffic 
 Parle stiff in the cabin 
 With axes, dismember a faggot 
 Limbs is scattered and littered with maggots 
 Splashed with gas, we lit up matches 
 That's for acting real tepid and passive 
 Y'all asking to give out passes 
 I pull up, get out Astons 
 But, never without ratchets 
 Bustas feel our wrath and 
 Butlers will fill our glasses 
 Brothers ain't up in our bracket 
 Slugs from the gattlin' spin out rappin' 
 Flip the casket, lyrics is crafted 
 Hit them with the plastic and then I'll pass it
