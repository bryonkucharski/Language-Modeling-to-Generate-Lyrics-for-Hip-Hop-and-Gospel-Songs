(L-burna *hook*) 
 Thug love, thug love 
 All she ever wanted was that thug loooooove 
 Thug love, thug love 
 All she ever wanted was that thug, love 
 Thug love, thug love 
 All she ever wanted was that thug loooooove 
 Thug love, thug love 
 All she ever wanted was that thug, love 
 (Angie) 
 Yo, hey yo, uh 
 Yo, yo, yo-yo, uh 
 Aiyyo I met him at a club, spendin dubs, Mr. Superthug 
 Pulled up with a group of trucks, everybody knew who he was 
 I ain't playin' the boy was cute, and I'm sayin' 
 We only danced one song but the whole night I was swayin 
 Mesmorized by his style, could tell he was wild 
 But he had a touch of class and a million buck smile 
 Got a thing for a thug and he fit the profile 
 Thug love, think I'm buggin brother let me know now 
 (Fat joe) 
 Yo... yeah, uh 
 Yo, yo... 
 What's his name?, what's the color of his Range?, what's his game? 
 Was he kickin it like he love his train?, full of octane? 
 Stop playin', know you ain't fall for that 
 (Yo he's pagin me) Ang' don't even think of callin back 
 Man I know those cats, him and his click be flowin crack 
 Up in Prominax, stickin them kids, by the laundromat 
 Pumpin that two-for-five, the rules imply 
 F***in' with them dudes that's trife, you lose your life 
 *FAT JOE* It's a thug love 
 *ANGIE* Searchin for love in the wrong places 
 *FAT JOE* A thug love 
 *ANGIE* Lovin' them rough with pretty faces 
 *FAT JOE* Even though he ain't right for you 
 *ANGIE*Joe I like this dude, I need advice from you 
 *FAT JOE*It's a thug love 
 *ANGIE* Searchin for love in the wrong places 
 *FAT JOE* A thug love 
 *ANGIE* Lovin' them rough with pretty faces 
 *FAT JOE* Even though he ain't right for you 
 *ANGIE* Yo yo, uh, uh, yo 
 (Angie) 
 I just can't explain why women are attracted to danger 
 A thug and a player look the same in linen 
 But one's packin a banger 
 I guess it's the anger that be in they eyes 
 Mixed together with a pinch of they sensual side 
 That gets me energized 
 Fly and confident, respected and highly dominant 
 Got me on the rise every time he drown me with compliments 
 Joey I'm fallin' for a thug, should I sacrifice? 
 Or let it go brother you never gave me bad advice 
 (Fat joe) 
 It's only right that I let you know which route to go 
 No doubt fo' sho', once he hits it, he's out the do' 
 Know I seem like a cock-blocker, but he's not proper 
 Besides you're my little sis, I gotta watch ya 
 Gotta stop you from dealin' with snakes 
 You're sealin your fate let alone I feel it's your wake 
 Eliminate all the wrongs in your life 
 Don't you fall for them guys, like Pun says, it's all in the eyes 
 (Chorus + hook) 
 (Fat joe) 
 I only speak on what I know, he cheats, he gotta go 
 You think he ain't gon' creep (not at all) 
 That's a damn shame, I see you fallin' for this man's game 
 The truth is even if he want it man he can't change 
 That's the life of a player livin' lies like the mayor 
 Hittin them thighs, be wise and beware 
 But don't be surprised, one day you'll find a decent guy 
 Someone that cares and provides a piece of mind 
 (Angie) 
 I know you right, but I'm torn inside 
 I got a jonz for a boy that was born to ride 
 My only vice (?), saw the guy, leave my momma mortified 
 It's no surprise, it happens all the time 
 Got me stressin and I'm comin' back for me 
 Got me, checkin' my messages expectin him to call 
 I need to, let it go need to stay focused 
 But can't, forget him yo so I remain hopeless 
 (Chorus + hook)
