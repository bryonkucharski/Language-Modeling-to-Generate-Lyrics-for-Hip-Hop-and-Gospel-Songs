I got a call from my girls around eight about that Friday spot 
 Round 12 hit the highway stop, I need gas 
 Car behind me on my ass, speed pass 
 Turn the radio on that's my joint got me and I need to dance 
 Pull up in the truck and it ain't my man's 
 You screaming "hey yo", you don't got a chance 
 Son, you are speaking a language I don't understand 
 Know the dude I hang with, I don't hold his hand 
 Cause, me, I'm free to choose 
 It's possible to leave with you 
 When we get through, I drive passenger seat for you 
 Let's ride 
 At one I arrive 
 Walked past the line 
 Damn his ass is fine 
 Some guy now we up in the spot 
 Watch 
 Place hot 
 Couple of bottles champagne popped 
 And that's how we doing it now 
 I'm scheming while the DJ's moving the crowd 
 I was wondering if I could take you home 
 Would ya still love me baby, if I could take you home 
 It's around 2 A.M. 
 The mood is trend 
 The club is snug 
 I see him watching, love is love 
 Caught him when I looked up, gave him a glance 
 Promotion chick walked over while I'm shaking her hand 
 I'm looking over her 
 Sorry but I'm waiting for this man 
 Is what I told her, so she could leave 
 No breaking up my plans 
 No time for talking about shows 
 Or dates that I could host 
 Damn, he walking over to me, they breaking out the jokes 
 My girls laughing 
 They see me already imagining 
 He whispered in my ear, would I dance with him 
 I answered him 
 He took my hand with him 
 Dancing close 
 I turned around and gave him my back, he passed a smoke 
 He put his hand on my hip, then my stomach 
 He must want it 
 And I was really just 'bout to leave, his clique fronted 
 Like they don't see 
 That they man 'bout to tell 'em peace 
 And to think, I wasn't even gonna go out... see? 
 All I need is my lip gloss, I.D., gum, and I'm straight 
 Especially if it's Envy in bungalow eight 
 We making it hot on the dance floor today 
 But my girls wanna leave cause there's nothing to take 
 Nothing to meet 
 Spot dead, nothing to see 
 Then we all agree that we won't leave 
 Cause some spots the papi's still come at three 
 That's when I tell the DJ to run that please 
 He dancing behind me 
 I feel what's under his jeans 
 And I had one too many so I'm under his scheme 
 I mean I'm cool and the gang 
 The music is playing 
 Think I found what I'm looking for, no purpose in waiting 
 Almost time for breakfast 
 Standing by the coat checkers 
 Looking for my parking lot ticket... that's it 
 And this night just ended 
 Can't say with who, what, or where but it'll definitely be remembered 
 Would you be my boyfriend? 
 For tonight only 
 Would you be my boyfriend? 
 For tonight only
