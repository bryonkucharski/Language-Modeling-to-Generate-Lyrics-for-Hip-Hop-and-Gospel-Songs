(Intro: A. Martinez) 
 Yo, uh 
 The animals are here 
 It's a new day... yo yo uh 
 It's about being close to the ground 
 Like dope fiends and not even fallin' 
 Some people frontin' now they keep callin' 
 But that's life, ain't no grudge in my heart 
 I could sleep mornings, that's the business 
 I just keep that shit apart, that's the wisdom 
 In my position get hard, I deal wit people from far 
 Very few I keep close, that's how you keep from the scars 
 You gotta move like a ghost, cause some people are stars 
 And all of a sudden... they forgot who they are 
 But look at me I'm still Angie, back wit a plan B 
 It's a new day you could sit down or stand me 
 I just try to be an example, bringin' the animal out 
 When everybody doubting underhand me 
 Its ample time, If you could not see the big picture 
 Cause there's plenty ladies like me I'm a big sista 
 Always on the grind through whatever you say 
 And just incase you ain't clear its okay 
 It's a new day! 
 If you need it to be, (uh) Then it can be (yeah) 
 It happen for me, It's a new day (a new day) 
 Keep hoping, Keep focus 
 Approaching, up, A new day 
 Reaction to my first verse in a year it was clearly unexpected 
 Me on a record, We must yeah agree it was hectic 
 Getting here half sleep and eating breakfast in my chair 
 How I feel, it's a new day now, that's for real 
 I was prepared to deal wit, whatever was given 
 People dissecting what I'm spitting on, not giving me a chance 
 Listen and understand, they ain't know how to react 
 Off my 16 bars on that track, "She out or she back Damn" 
 Then came a record ("If I could go") 
 I'm not saying my shits perfected 
 But if I could go's the beginning accept it, connected 
 You already know, yes is an automatic question 
 Automatically answered 'cause I'm flowing like you never heard 
 Why second one it can't be said in words 
 Except it had to be done, in other words I'm leaving on top 
 You mad at me huh, believe it won't stop 
 The love it's much stronger you can not break my hunger 
 See they love for you to give up, can't wait for you to slip up 
 As soon as you hit rock bottom, they never picking you up 
 Or never picking you out, they always out when you pick 
 But when your outfits is sick, or you got a hit 
 Then every other word is, "No Doubt, 
 When can we go out, When can we grab lunch," I only get mad once 
 'Cause when you get mad twice you sacrifice then a punch 
 And then a situation jumps so I grab a blunt 
 Roll it and spark it cause you media targets 
 Pictures is blatant ya know what I'm saying 
 This ain't ancient this is today shit 
 But it's a new day shit no games get played shit 
 No time get wasted, I learn from the worst situations ("yep") 
 And I made it, everything I had in my heart I pushed and gave it 
 So when I say it's a new day I mean it 
 'Cause when it's the truth you must agree shit! 
 Ya hear me singing 
 We on our way 
 Animal house
