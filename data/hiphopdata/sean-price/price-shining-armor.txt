Yo! Listen 
 Afghanistan, bombed out, depleted 
 I'm weeded, needin' an Ativan 
 Run up on a rapper when rappin', that's when I slap a fan 
 Bone-crunch you niggies, the gypsy needin' a caravan 
 Half-man half-amazing, Mandela 
 You know the flow is so hard, tell her, Duck Down 
 Is the label, but - fuck a record deal 
 Broke after I smoke and the motherfuckin' sucker meal 
 P! Keep ignorin' my shit, B 
 I'll punch your shit off like the Story of Ricky 
 All in my face like a rap battle 
 Fuck around and catch all of the eight when the gat rattles 
 That hardcore rappin' is played out 
 Till I hardcore slap you and ask you what's played out 
 (What's played out, man?) P! Indeed the grown 
 Squeeze the chrome, please believe it nigga, Caesar home 
 Work wet, wet work with the sket wet, who? 
 Vest protect chest, but never get neck duke 
 Dave Tua, fist of rage, I wave Rugers 
 Engage shooters in battles, better behave, junior 
 Ay yo, kill noid paragraph, crack ground, shatter glass 
 Ill boy, Madagas', bitch with a fatter ass 
 Top on the rooftop, spit shine my shit 
 Pitch grind my strip, switch crime rhyme hits 
 Got a towel, better throw it in 
 Frontline bangin', P, cover me I'm goin' in 
 War path is bloody, damaged from one sword stroke 
 48 tracks to slide and the board broke 
 What it do, coke kilogram crew (what up?) 
 The bars is barbaric, Encino Man 2 
 Paul Bunyan on the corner with the onion 
 In the booth I'm the dragon breathin' fire out the dungeon 
 Fuck a metaphor, fuck you think the metal for 
 Put the mic down, fuck rap, peddle raw 
 Street fighter, Juxx strike like Bison 
 The nigga ghostwriting for Price on Mic Tyson
