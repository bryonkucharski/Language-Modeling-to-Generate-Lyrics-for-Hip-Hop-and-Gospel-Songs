It's the start of the ending 
 I'm departing but sending 
 This message out, the sket is out 
 You a target that's trembling 
 It goes, Hanna Barbara barbarian 
 Bars better than yours 
 And your entourage, pa, Sean bury 'em 
 You know how the shit go 
 No disco, Sisquo, or calypso 
 Blow piff, four-fifth, smoke mixed with indo 
 East African beast battering Chief Kimbo 
 Barefooted, stepping on hot coal 
 Shaka Zulu, spear chucking 
 You front and I'mma shoot you 
 Hardcore rap at its worst 
 Move from the morgue truck to the back of the hearse 
 Move from the back of the hearse to back in the dirt 
 Change clothes, put a back on his turf, move on 
 Do Sean 
 Can't be me, motherfucker, your shoes wrong 
 Boot Camp for life, B 
 Nine times out of ten, you can catch me in Nikes 
 It's the start of the ending 
 I'm departing but sending 
 This kite out, it's lights out 
 You are marked with an emblem 
 It's the start of the ending 
 I'm departing but sending 
 This message out, the sket is out 
 You a target that's trembling
