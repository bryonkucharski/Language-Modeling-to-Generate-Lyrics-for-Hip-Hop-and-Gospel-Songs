Gotta be P hating 
 The fist to your face claiming Muhammad Ali shaking 
 Fist full of chips grated, gotta be P caking 
 Whimp you with Jim faking, gotta be P aping 
 I sell white rock, and clap canons 
 I'm old school like white rock soda and backgammon 
 Rap phantom, Sean is a starving artist 
 I gain a lot of weight cause a nigga eating regardless 
 You a target, and talk about bullseye 
 You a Target employee, a good guy 
 And ain't nothing wrong with that, nigga 
 Ain't nothing wrong with this 
 I make something strong with rap, nigga 
 And guess what, the nigga next up 
 He can't make a song for shit 
 P, mad smart, no Cornell West shit 
 But I can make death ring your doorbell next, kid 
 I told y'all I'm with the family, chill 
 Don't sleep on a phone call, it'll get your family killed 
 Gotta be Sean 
 Gotta be who bodied the song 
 Cause Brownsville ill, gotta be on 
 Ruckus, you wrong 
 Gotta be what the fuck is you on? 
 Popping pills, chopping krills what the fuck is you doing? 
 Gotta be the best rapper to spit it 
 Clap in a minute 
 Gotta let these niggas know who still actually live it, P 
 It gotta be P snapping 
 The fifth to your face, shake, I gotta be relapsing 
 Spit in your face, maybe gotta be P laughing 
 Gift from the eight? Great, it gotta be P clapping 
 I can't stand around you bitch niggas 
 Emph beam make your team steam like a fish dinner 
 But the new shit burgandy 
 With new kicks straight from Munich, Germany 
 My net worth be making your neck jerk 
 Expert whenever, wherever the sket burst 
 The most fabulous flow 
 Yo, your whole shit dead, toe tag on the floor 
 Villain of speech, rappers play pretend with the beats 
 Hit with the knife, goodnight, then I send 'em to sleep 
 Nigga, General P 
 And the kit is like the Confederate General Lee 
 P! 
 Gotta be Sean 
 Gotta be who bodied the song 
 Cause Brownsville ill, gotta be on 
 Ruckus, you wrong 
 Gotta be what the fuck is you on? 
 Popping pills, chopping krills what the fuck is you doing? 
 Gotta be the best rapper to spit it 
 Clap in a minute 
 Gotta let these niggas know who still actually live it, P
