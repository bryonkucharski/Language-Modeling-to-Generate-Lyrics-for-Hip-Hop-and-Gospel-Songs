I'm the best in the borough, I'm the best in the city 
 I'm the best of the state, and the rest of you fakes 
 Don't question the ape, throw the sket at your face 
 Bang, bang, shoot 'em up, make a mess of the place 
 Oh, you a E head, oh, you a weed head 
 I got a big gun, bigger than Maxi Priest dreads 
 Fuck a rhyme though I'm on back on my grind mode 
 Me and my connect keeping it kosher like Shyne Po 
 How that nine go? Where your guns at? 
 Faking moves, 80's fool, he a lunch pack 
 This a dumb rap, but I can rap smarter 
 The educated rapper, the African Godfather 
 Just shoot and spray, Ruck boomaye 
 Mandingo warrior from the Alajuela 
 Y'all niggas know the flow is weak and 
 Your bitch suck dick for show tickets 
 Yo, you a battle rapper 
 You be rapping in battles 
 I shoot the shit up, duke, it's a wrap for the battle 
 Niggas yapping they tattle 
 It's a wrap when I catch you 
 Chrome to your eyefold, you got clapped at your apple 
 I'm God's favorite 
 I'm flagrant, arms facing 
 I'm breaking your arms while niggas raping your moms naked 
 P forever, I'm better, the wordsmith 
 Lyrically Michael the Tyson, you Trevor the Berbick 
 Smack a nigga on sight, B 
 Adidas track suit with Nikes 
 Mean mugging who? Your jeans colorful 
 Rainbow Brite, good night, I can't fuck with you 
 You a lame, homie, do ya thing, homie 
 Put your head between your legs and do your thing, homie 
 Literally, y'all niggas is bitch boys 
 The last LP I quit, boy
