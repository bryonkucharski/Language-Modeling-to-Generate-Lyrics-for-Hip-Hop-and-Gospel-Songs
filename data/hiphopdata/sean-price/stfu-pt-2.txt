All I do is rap and rhyme 
 I don't know today's math, don't keep track of time 
 Universal beat down, beat down your universe 
 Sean P AKA you the worst 
 The best rapper, the worst rapper 
 The sket clapper, the purse snatcher 
 The neck snapper, the Earth slapper 
 This your man Sean 
 The opposite of a fucking Duran Duran song 
 That nigga soft with the wack shit 
 My raps slap the Earth off of its axis 
 You dealing with a motherfucking boss, you bastard 
 Niggas die when I'm raising my voice a ratchet 
 Motherfucker, do you 
 Form a fan, cast it, smacked posted on YouTube 
 P, I spray the gat at your ride 
 Sean Price the greatest rapper alive 
 Shut the fuck up 
 The first verse uno, second verse dos 
 First verse is bueno, the next one is boss 
 Back when Milk was chilling 
 My man smoked a bag of dust and killed his children 
 No fucking around, no Wilt the stilting 
 Niggas that's off balance gets killed for tilting 
 I bang burners at bitches that's built for building 
 Cover your Ralph Tresvant, quilt your feelings 
 Too hot, take off the hot sweater 
 Expose a lot of chedder, get popped with a hot Beretta 
 African boss Mandela 
 Idi Amin when smoking the ya mean 
 Clutching the pound 
 Then I start waving my arms and fucking around 
 Niggas stop playing with Sean, listen 
 I spit prison imam bars 
 That'll put you in a ER, pa 
 Shut the fuck up
