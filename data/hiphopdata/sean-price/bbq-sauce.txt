Nigga, when they see him they say that's that nigga 
 His last name should have been that's that nigga 
 Sound kinda nice, that's that nigga 
 Never catch 'em with them plastic half-ass niggas 
 When you hear it you should hashtag niggas 
 Since birth, a little bastard-ass nigga 
 White people do not recite the chorus 
 If you do we'll wash your mouth with Lavoris nigga 
 Listen, and the boy better 
 I do it for real, you acting Andrew Lloyd Webber 
 Real McCoy leather from the back of the cow ass 
 The culture power will kill you, fuck if the four blast 
 I said the same thing twice 
 Telephone gun, my nigga the thing ring twice 
 You a cock diesel, nigga extra ginseng tight 
 I'm a pop eagle, nigga when the thing ring twice 
 Sean is the first name 
 Fifth fire first, motherfucker, the first flame 
 Earthlings leave their face in the street 
 You pick up your face and wait for police 
 But the father do floss 
 I make your mom suck my dick with barbecue sauce 
 Nigga, when they see him they say that's that nigga 
 His last name should have been that's that nigga 
 Sound kinda nice, that's that nigga 
 Never catch 'em with them plastic half-ass niggas 
 When you hear it you should hashtag niggas 
 Since birth, a little bastard-ass nigga 
 White people do not recite the chorus 
 If you do we'll wash your mouth with Lavoris nigga 
 Bafa shiki 
 Four fifth knocking you, rocking you, die from leaking 
 Popping your beanie for rocking a hot bikini 
 Transgender, blam-blam leaving your man injured 
 You perpetrating a fraud, penetrating a Floyd 
 Wild dance moves, you be demonstrating on boys 
 Two slaps and I'm deadin' you 
 Give a nigga a lesson on how to catch a predator 
 Nigga, I'm a ride on every 
 Niggas crossdressing, the essence of Tyler Perry 
 Fucking can-can dancing, blam blam and son 
 Shucking and jiving, man-tan advancing 
 I show no love 
 Bozo thugs when you throw those duds 
 I ain't believing in y'all 
 Make your mom suck my dick with blue cheese on my balls, P 
 Nigga, when they see him they say that's that nigga 
 His last name should have been that's that nigga 
 Sound kinda nice, that's that nigga 
 Never catch 'em with them plastic half-ass niggas 
 When you hear it you should hashtag niggas 
 Since birth, a little bastard-ass nigga 
 White people do not recite the chorus 
 If you do we'll wash your mouth with Lavoris nigga
