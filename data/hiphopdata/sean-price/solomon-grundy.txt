Gun in my hand, shoot 
 Hand me a gram, shoot 
 Misunderstanded with the family man, shoot 
 I'm banging, I'm Beirut 
 I'm training in state boots 
 I hang with the same group 
 Aim at your grapefruit 
 The shit that you say cute? 
 I can't relate, duke 
 The trey pound's related to the ache in the face full 
 Nigga, I hate you, break you, Ivan Drago 
 I'm rushing to put pellets in your pecan pronto 
 P! Ain't talking money, we can't convo 
 You pussy under pressure, pa 
 P stand strong, though 
 I bring in the shells, I beat up your squad 
 You singing in jail, you Chico DeBarge 
 Fucking nickel bag steamers 
 I sell coke that's whiter than milk of magnesia 
 Frankenstein when I'm making mine 
 You think you rhyme, you should think of mine 
 Solomon Grundy 
 I made my bones shaving Sharon Stones in a school zone 
 One way ticket from the projects to a pool home 
 Trapping, balling, and rappin' is the hoods holy trinity 
 I sold a pack 'fore I lost my virginity 
 Surrounded by speed freaks and weed geeks 
 Quiet down, listen up when g's speak 
 Return of the body catcher, the crown's been captured 
 Caught up in the rapture, I slaughtered a bunch of rappers 
 Ain't no Tarzan in the marshland 
 Fumes from the meth cook turn me into the swamp man 
 Get the red wine out 
 White lines and Amy Winehouse 
 Walk fine lines in hindsight 
 Coulda made some better choices 
 I didn't always have to listen to the voices 
 Thug in my bloodline, mud pies and drug buys 
 The dead live on and love dies 
 Solomon Grundy 
 Ill Bill murder futuristic like Paul Laffoley 
 Haul your casket away 
 Assassins'll spray 
 Reptilian like a cannibal's brain 
 Horrifying like dying in a two-passenger plane 
 Nosediving, fire in the sky, showers of flame 
 Houses of pain on cypress hills and mountainous terrain 
 Even a lion chills after an ounce of sour to the face 
 I'm the lightning that the Vikings worshipped 
 The sight of when a rifles bursting 
 Write subversive 
 I'm a decisive person 
 Liquor on a bullet wound 
 Feel the Henny sting 
 Everything is everything 
 I'm a Heavy Metal King 
 Been labeled intelligent, irreverent, malevolent 
 True indeed, plus a veteran 
 On point like the Devil's chin 
 Surrounded by apparitions and statues of smiling death 
 Assassins with pistols capture your dying breath 
 Like you stepped into a horror flick 
 Kill you then resurrect you in the middle of a blizzard of hollow tips 
 Solomon Grundy
