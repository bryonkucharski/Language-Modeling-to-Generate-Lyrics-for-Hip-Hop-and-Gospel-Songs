One for the money, two for the dough 
 Three for the paper, that's all that I know 
 Broke with a job, or crook with the cash 
 You be hoping to God I don't put my foot in your ass 
 Got my foot on the gas, and I'm running the red 
 Put this pack in your ass, I just gun you dreads 
 Never go on the block, like I used to do 
 Why go on the block, all my niggas moved 
 Mister boom bap rap whatever 
 The black leather match the black Nike Venoms 
 So nice that my wife be in em 
 Body the great grape ape 
 Probably break one eighth of your face off 
 Break north 
 Fake and soft, pa and I hate all of you 
 Punch you in the face now you able to taste barbecue 
 Hard to do this, I'm doing me 
 You can do what you do, just don't do it in front of P 
 Personally, it's nothing personal 
 You send a verse for me, I'll send a hearse to you 
 Clearly it's that, the realer you act 
 I'm actually one of the rappers that really can rap 
 One for the money, two for the dough 
 Three for the paper, that's all that I know 
 You call that a show, it's more of a circus 
 You tryna hear Buck flow, still calling 'em nervous 
 You fall for the service, you fall on your face 
 Judging shit backwards, stop calling this case 
 Now I'm all in your space, 'cause I'm outta this world 
 And if I show what's on my plate, say goodbye to your girl 
 She really a bird, 'cause you're giving her seeds 
 Then leave, now she expect the same shit from me 
 Please, use your knees for a stand 
 You got a big mouth, now who deeming my little man 
 Damn, it's a new pedestal that I sit on 
 Son, I'mma shit on better stools 
 The tools that I use, two hammers 
 One for the nail in your coffin, the next for your life after 
 Personally, it's nothing personal 
 You send a verse to me, I'll send a hearse to you 
 Clearly it's that, really you're wack 
 I'm actually one of them rappers that really can rap 
 I'm actually one of them clappers that actually strap 
 I'm actually running with Africans, trafficking smack 
 I'm actually smacking the nap off your faculty jack 
 Exploiting the Black, nigga nap Cadillac rap 
 Fake fuck, I will fuck up your face 
 Fuck face fingers, fuck trigger nigga the ape
