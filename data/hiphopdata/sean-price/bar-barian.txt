I don't want to dougie, I just want money 
 Studied under the understudy the one-twenty 
 Young dummies can't spar 
 No life, my flow tight, like your pants are 
 You don't got a chance, Pa 
 Ansaar community, Malachi York fricasse, yo fuck a eulogy 
 Fuck jewelry; what jewelry 
 I took this from another rapper 
 Slapped him with the toolie, G 
 Cornball rappers, I see you on BET 
 Relieved of their jewelry, interview Beef DVD 
 P TNT, the flow dynamite 
 Niggas so-so, bozos ain't rhyming right 
 I hit a line of white, I smoke a dub of green 
 Niggas call it purple, what the fuck you mean 
 Fuck a fistfight, I'm gunning you rappers 
 I don't give a fuck about none of y'all rappers 
 Fifth spray shit, the piff stay lit 
 My bitch stay dipped with the Richard Bey tits 
 Niggas say shit, they say it ain't shit 
 Shut the fuck up nigga I'm nothing to play with, P 
 I bust heaters at your whole damn clique, blaow 
 Sean Price, the leader of Boot Camp Clik now 
 Admire the admirable animal rap 
 Smack the shit out of a nigga and hand him his hat 
 Banging on wax, niggas don't bang in the street 
 Banging online, niggas don't bang in the street 
 Playing for keeps, keep playing 
 I slam your ass on your face till your fucking teeth breaking 
 P, the jerk that retired, I'm nice so I'm back niggas 
 Smack earth, wind, fire, and ice out that nigga 
 Rap niggas, I doubt if there's 
 Nigga doing it like me, fuck outta here, P
