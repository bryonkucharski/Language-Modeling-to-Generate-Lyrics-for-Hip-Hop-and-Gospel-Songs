Stuck in a jam 
 Why you wanna fuck with me, fam? 
 I'm tryna live a square life, you wanna fuck up my plan 
 Under a bus, fucker, I'll throw you under a van 
 Throw the van in reverse and then I'll do it again 
 Grand theft auto, the man with the sket also 
 Two turntables, a tec that'll touch torsos 
 Niggas thinking that the family sweet 
 Run up on Ruck you'll get beat with hands and feet, nigga 
 Kimbo Slice and a slice of Jim Kelly 
 Thing go pop and it enter your thin belly 
 Fuck being humble, I'm better than everybody 
 Melancholy niggas get hit with a heavy shotty 
 Dumb fucks don't know how the rules go 
 Young pups can't fuck with the Cujo 
 You bark better than you bite 
 Yeah, I bark, but I'm better when I fight 
 Some of the nicest niggas in the game is friends 
 If I do a song with 'em then the friendship'll end 
 Sore loser 
 Spitting the raw, ignore Rugers 
 That nigga frauds like Jean Claude and broad movers 
 East coast niggas, west coast niggas 
 I eat most niggas with the sket close, nigga 
 I make you mad you livin' 
 Fucking with Sean Price, that's a bad decision 
 I was once fucked up, from the ash I risen 
 A lot of fights, almost got slashed in prison 
 Money on my head, you can ask my imam 
 This rap is a actual fact that's written 
 I'll fuck a nigga up, but if cash is given 
 I will split a nigga head, call it bad division 
 I dismember your memory, holmes
