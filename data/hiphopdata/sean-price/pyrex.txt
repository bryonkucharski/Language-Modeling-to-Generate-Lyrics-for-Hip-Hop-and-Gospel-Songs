Whole lot of shots followed 
 After I bust your snot box with a Ciroc bottle 
 Shoot the fed, one mano-a-mano the clown 
 I'll pull a pound on a Ronald McDonald 
 You a happy meal nigga, with a toy in the box 
 I clap the steel, nigga, put your boy in a box 
 P, and the gun that'll slap ya 
 I'm lying, just like the rest of these dumb ass rappers 
 Provide flesh, most of y'all niggas can't test besides Tech 
 Most of y'all niggas can't dress, Nike Galore 
 Right on the floor 
 Copped twenty pair with Vinnie one time on tour 
 Listen, love is love, clap the gat at y'all players 
 The CEO of your label is a basketball player 
 That mean your shit is never coming out 
 Sean Price, I'm forever dumbing out, pyrex 
 Pyrex, a microwave, and a whisk 
 You're probably thinking I'm baking a cake when I'm working a whip 
 You probably think it's pyrex 
 Wake up, all of that crack in the street talk 
 It's made up like "Jack and the Beanstalk" 
 When I talk, the streets listen 
 When you talk, the streets dissin' 
 I don't even like you 
 I don't even wanna fight you 
 So stay the fuck away 
 For such and such from such and such, combust and spray 
 Don't make me abuse my power 
 One telephone call, shoot this coward 
 I was the bum, but the pendulum switched 
 Now my whole team supreme, no Kenneth McGriff 
 Y'all niggas is fiends, steamed tilapia 
 Ving Rhames in the bing, slapping ya, animal 
 Different beast on my fucking sweater, giranimal 
 Half monkey, half man; the manimal 
 P, heatmiser in disguise, surprise beat fire 
 Spark fire out your face and break wires 
 Pyrex, a microwave, and a whisk 
 You're probably thinking I'm baking a cake when I'm working a whip 
 You probably think it's pyrex
