How can I explain this game? 
 Got me on the road everyday, to fill my name, 
 Me and my dreams of gettin' the world crunk, 
 The hits bring bling, and do the ATL stomp, this thang real, 
 I got the gun chill, cranberry's and x pills, 
 Smokin' on the best of the best, 
 When you see me you know I'm fresh, 
 In the black lambo, I ain't ridin' there hoe, 
 Probably roll my other up, tell them what, I don't give a fu**, 
 Prince's cut, round my neck, round my wrist, in my ear, 
 In my son ear, in his mama ear, crystal clear, 
 Listen hear, this fo all y'all ni**az bitin' my flow, 
 Wanna come up in the game, I can't stand a mane actin' like I don't know, 
 Yeah!, There's been a whole lotta talkin', Pastor Troy ni**a, where my motherfu**in offerin? 
 Yeah!, It's a whole lotta bitin', tell them ni**az keep motherfu**in fightin, 
 Yeah!, It's a whole lotta suspicion, about who I'm fu**in, about who I'm hittin 
 Yeah!, Baby give me why ya can't, 'cause I ain't playin' with ya this year man (well ah ha) 
 I been watchin these ni**az from a fog, 
 My best friend left me with some dope in his car, 
 So now I been hesitant to roll with the crowd, 
 I represent ni**az smokin' dro', actin' wild (ya feel me now?) 
 I been bouncin', ever since the 9 dro, 
 Money, cars, clothes, hoes, 17 years old... 
 Hop in the club with no I.D., no ni**a here is gonna try me, zone 1, 2, 3 r e s p e c t 
 V.I.P, bout 20 deep, hardest nigga in the street, 
 Tryin' to find me a bi*** I can check, 
 Probably be the bitch on the deck, 
 Better yet, I'ma slap a bi*** ass ni**a, a fu** ass ni**a, ol bitin ass ni**a, 
 Yeah!, it's a whole lotta talkin', Pastor Troy ni**a, where my motherfu**in offerin?
