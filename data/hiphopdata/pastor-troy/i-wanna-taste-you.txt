 Verse One 
 Now I'm jus sittin' here, watchin my, baby in her lingerie, 
 I'm kissin' her, holdin' her, listenin to 12 play, 
 And I'm sunk in one, hopin one, day she could be wifey. 
 Thugged up from da flo up but hell dats why she like it, 
 So politely, I asked her, why does she love da pastor? 
 Did she love me combo or was it just my condo? 
 She answered me, pronto, why don't you believe me? 
 If you don't believe me then motha fucka leave it. 
 I loved it, her answer; it killed me like a cancer. 
 All I could do is smile; she knew it the whole while, 
 I could see you wit my child, look me in my face boo, 
 How can I replace you? Baby, I wanna taste you. 
 I wanna taste you,

 'Cause you look so good to me. (Wohhwoh)

 I wanna taste you,

 Ok 
 Very few sights, Light da lights, how you light 'em up, 
 Love how we fuck, love when I get my dick sucked,

 Got dat thang all nice and shaved, I'm bout'a let my tongue cave, 
 Lickin' ha neck, lickin' ha ear, girl don't run bring yo ass here, 
 Lickin' her spine makin' her cringe, then I suck her titties, then 
 Lick around her belly ring, ('cause) imma bout'a do da thing, 
 Kissin' on her thigh, as I listen to r Kelly sing, 
 12 play soft, in the back-ground its goin' down, 
 I just feel her finga tips, every time I lick her lips, 
 She grabbin on my dreads, I'm cummin out dat head, 
 And gon give her breakfast in bed . that's my baby.
