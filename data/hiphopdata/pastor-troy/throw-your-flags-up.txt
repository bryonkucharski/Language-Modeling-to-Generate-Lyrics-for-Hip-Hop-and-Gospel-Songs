I'm in my big body Benz 
 Riding with 4 of my friends 
 Shoot a bird at them coppers 
 While blowing smoke in the wind 
 Up out the window my flag 
 I got my foot on the gas 
 Then my yak on the dash 
 Then we run up at yo ass 
 Riding the streets of Atlanta 
 Better take out the camera 
 D.S.G.B. on my banner, raised high 
 Until I die, bet I'ma through it up 
 It's Pastor Troy, 2000, don't give a 
 Throw up yo flags 
 Throw yo flags up! [repeat 7X] 
 Come on you scared, you scared 
 (Verse 2: Pastor Troy) 
 I got them fifteen's pushing, trying to rip up the speaker 
 Know that Pastor and Peter, on the hunt for the reaper 
 Call ???, CMB got the world in a dro' 
 We flexing hard in Atlanta, or we get the scope 
 It's GA, Georgia Tech or Bulldog 
 2nd seed we, and I'm bout to Boss Hog 
 Atlanta to Augusta a hustla straight out the rip 
 Them Georgia boys my army forever we stand equipped 
 Ready for whatever you better go ask around 
 We ain't bout to playground with ya, we cutting ya down 
 A million little boys trying to sound like me 
 Now everybody copying the one that dissed P 
 A second prized G, but I ain't chicken 
 Soon as you think I'm slippin you hear that pistol clickin' 
 And I'ma try my best to eat yo ass for dinner 
 Better throw up yo flag and tell me that you surrender 
 Throw it up 
 Throw yo flags up! [3X] yeah, yeah 
 Throw yo flags up! [3X] come on you scared, you scared 
 Throw yo flags up! [3X] yeah, yeah 
 Throw yo flags up! [3X] come on you scared, you scared
