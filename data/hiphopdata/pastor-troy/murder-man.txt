Iiiiiii'm comin', two .50 cal's in hand 
 Long goat-tee nigga the Taliban 
 I'm Murda Man, I'm tryna murk somethin' 
 This ain't for ??? cheese I'm tryna hurt somethin' 
 These niggaz claimin g'z, claimin they run the South East 
 How you run the shit in that buck buck Caprice? 
 Atleast, you oughta know bout my flow 
 The P the T the R the O 
 The Y nigga, I'm so fly call me jet 
 Jump off in the ocean still ain't wet 
 I flex, I motherfuckin ball better ask em 
 Catch a nigga talkin' shit 'n' motherfuckin blast em 
 Murda, m-u-r-d-a 
 I'm pumpin gats at whoever in the way 
 I'm back wit gun play, don't think they undastand 
 But I don't think they wanna fuck wit the Murda Man, Murda Man

 Fuck wit the Murda Man, fuck wit the Murda Man, Well Uh-Huh

 Yaaaaa'll trippin', now everybody crunk 
 Y'all niggaz gon make me pop the trunk 
 'Cause I remember way back in the day 
 When the ATL wasn't gettin' no play 
 Then I came out, dropped We Ready 
 Niggaz went to bouncin', ridin' them box Chevy's 
 But I guess that was then, this is now 
 When I catch ya ass in the street the gun blow, blow 
 I represent the hard, I represent the angle 
 I represent the real, I represent the danger 
 I represent the cars, I represent the dream 
 I represent respect, I'm representin my team 
 It's Mister PT aka Murda Man 
 Ya pistol in ya car, my pistol in my hand 
 And you can ask Chan, I shot a nigga van 
 Don't think you understand, I'm the fuckin' Murda Man, Murda Man and 
 Stiiiiiiiill spinnin, empty my magazine 
 I jump off in my limousine and flee the scene 
 This ain't the SWAT team, this ain't Lil Scrap 'n' them 
 I rep that hard shit and fuck a platinum 
 And Little Jon, used to by homey, used to be my Ace 
 Now I wanna slap the the taste out ya mouth 
 Nigga down south I'm a legend 
 When ya see me keep motherfuckin steppin 
 And flexin, so what you gotta A at nigga 
 That don't mean shit to a south side killa 
 Wussup Shay? wussup Tod? 
 On that ass, Shady Park 
 Murda, M-U-R-D-A

 Cockin my A-K, don't think they understand 
 But I don't think they wanna fuck wit the Murda Man, Murda Man, and
