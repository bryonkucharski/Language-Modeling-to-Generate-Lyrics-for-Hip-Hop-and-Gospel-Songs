Listen to this track bitch 
 Will he will he come home tonight I'm praying for my 
 Ganstas and my real niggas will he will he coming home 
 Tonigh I'm praying for my gansta and my real niggas 
 He will he come home tonight I'm praying for my ganstas and my real niggas 
 I ain't never meant to be gangsta 
 I ain't never meant to be hard 
 This world so full of anger 
 It's like the monies god 
 But I know better so the chetta ain't a issue 
 Plus everybody in the chevy ridin' wit ya 
 But everybody wit ya ain't down 
 And everybody down ain't wit ya 
 All you gotta do is call his name 
 He'll send his angels to get ya 
 Heavenly send your angels of protection 
 'Cause now the whole world got weapons 
 We gon make it home tonight 
 Yeah I'm smokin' and thankin' about the future 
 Livin' in a world where ya own kind'll shoot ya 
 Gettin' to the money its funny but u a target 
 Brain washed really nigga this is silly 
 Killin' bout rims killin' bout cash 
 When its about the credit they make us look pathetic 
 So tonight I just want you to play this song 
 And everybody make it bak home its on*
