(Pastor troy) 
 Lord I'm sorry, I'm tired 
 God I'm tired, God I'm tired 
 Don't nobody know what it is, don't nobody know it's like 
 I'm livin' today through tomorrow and I know I ain't gon' make it 
 Livin' today through tomorrow while yesterday was cursed 
 I put the pistol in my mouth and yell fuck the earth 
 I worked for food stamps without the book instead of helping me 
 Or blessing me my niggaz below, I thank my niggaz 
 And tommy hill can't help me figure a damn thang 
 Less than frontin me a pound of weed or some cocaine 
 I had got to the same conclusion that uncle sam made 
 Don't touch the dope but know it's movin' 
 And if it's proven what I'm doin's gonna hurt to the hustle 
 That's on the muscle this whole motherfuckin world is trouble 
 When I don't laugh took the color, 
 Took the color blind while toatin dimes and my nut sack full time, 
 I'm grindin playa, damn askin momma may i 
 I'm writin fire bet you wanna fuck up nigga start gettin' high 
 I rely on my mother nature, quarter to break her 
 Gotta show her I appreciate her, with all these haters 
 That be constantly surrounding me, nowhere to go 
 So I smoke some weed and drink some mo' 
 Now they my friends and I been in a bunch of crazy moods 
 God please excuse quick to race because I love to lose 
 Yeah I'm the loser 
 (Pastor troy) 
 God I can't take this no more, I can't take this no more 
 I'm sorry, I can't take this no more (*gun goes off*) 
 Livin' today through tomorrow while yesterday was cursed 
 I put the pistol in my mouth and yell fuck the earth 
 Livin' today through tomorrow while yesterday was cursed 
 I put the pistol in my mouth, put the pistol in my mouth 
 Now see the thouhgts of what you showin me 
 A empty picture as I beg the world for everything 
 Never could get a piece of this American dream 
 (I took a nap) I took a nap when I wake up the same thang 
 Back in trap, shootin craps without shootin guns man that's my life 
 They say that I'm the son of god, I thinkin' twice 
 The price of the leather see and I don't speak 
 As I preach keep the pistol in my reach 
 'Cause niggaz crazy, look at how this doja made me man I don't sweat 
 Playin' Russian roulette with the tech place yo bet 
 Love let the devil kill me (I'll be okay) 
 'Cause I'm gone have to die any fuckin' way why not today
