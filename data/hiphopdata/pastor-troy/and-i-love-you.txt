I remember when I met 'cha, I was only sixteen 
 Who would ever thought that me and you would get the cream? 
 We took a lot of trips together, you stayed down 
 Remember when we start hoppin' on that Greyhound? 
 She say she like to play hide and seek in the ride 
 And sure I'll open up the trunk and hide her inside 
 She say she think I'm cheatin' wit a girl named Jane 
 You ain't just my baby, bitch, you my everything 
 I was broke but you made things better 
 As long as me and you together, we can get this cheddar 
 Whatever, her name White Sally 
 I met her through my homeboy Rico out in Cali 
 I thank Reagan for the haters when ya got hard 
 You bought me jewels, Gator shoes and some big cars 
 Yeah, you took me out in the hood, gave me good thangs 
 Now we on a private plane eatin' chicken wings, come on 
 (And I love you) 
 You the reason why I ride good 
 You the reason why I shop good 
 Drink good, smoke good 
 (And I love you) 
 You the reason why these hoes choose 
 You the reason why a nigga sprayed 
 Candy on my old school 
 (And I love you) 
 You the reason why I quarterback 
 Took a nigga out the projects 
 Put me in a cul-de-sac 
 That's why I get it how I live, boy 
 'Cause you took me 
 From a young broke nigga to a Rich Boy 
 And I love you, baby, muah, hugs and kisses 
 Fuck them niggas and fuck them bitches 
 Been in this game since 1998 
 Nigga, take the safety and shit but I'm great 
 Maybe it's fate, destiny, you tell me 
 Damn near ten and that shit been free 
 But I'm PT so I gots to cruise, nigga 
 Really ain't shit to prove to y'all niggas 
 All the cars, all the clothes 
 Wit all the stars and all the hoes 
 First class flights, a nigga live in the lights 
 But see you in the dark, this stuff is kinda hard 
 See where I park, valet costs a note 
 Drop another fifty just to check my coat 
 Probably leave wit yo' chick, know how I do 
 It's Pastor Disaster, baby, I love you 
 (And I love you) 
 You the reason why I ride good 
 You the reason why I shop good 
 Drink good, smoke good 
 (And I love you) 
 You the reason why these hoes choose 
 You the reason why a nigga sprayed 
 Candy on my old school 
 (And I love you) 
 You the reason why I quarterback 
 Took a nigga out the projects 
 Put me in a cul-de-sac 
 That's why I get it how I live, boy 
 'Cause you took me 
 From a young broke nigga to a Rich Boy 
 Took me from a gun totin' nigga to a Big Boi 
 Too legit to slip, now I got papers on my shit, boi 
 And not just a weapon, I'm talkin' 'bout titles and deeds 
 You payin' rent you can't afford and can't break out of your lease 
 I'm out of your league, I might as well be Ivy 
 All over ya ass like injections in a stripper's hiney 
 Rhyming is a skill that requires timing 
 Like dual ejaculation while my lady's riding 
 I'm 'bout to cum, I'm 'bout to cum at the same time 
 Satisfied? I'm satisfied, that's how I slang mine 
 A generation came up under my style 
 From penetration of the nation when I was just a child 
 Now, who's really in the critics talk 'bout me? 
 Andre 3000 and three mo' niggas that's really fie 
 Let me break it down, I get fly at that mouth 
 I stay fresh to the hosiery we 'posed to be 
 Them niggas from the South 
 So one to the two, the three, the fo' 
 Satisfied? I'm satisfied, so I'ma get 'cha some mo' 
 (And I love you) 
 You the reason why I ride good 
 You the reason why I shop good 
 Drink good, smoke good 
 (And I love you) 
 You the reason why these hoes choose 
 You the reason why a nigga sprayed 
 Candy on my old school 
 (And I love you) 
 You the reason why I quarterback 
 Took a nigga out the projects 
 Put me in a cul-de-sac 
 That's why I get it how I live, boy 
 'Cause you took me 
 From a young broke nigga to a Rich Boy 
 And I love you 
 And I love you 
 And I love you 
 And I love you 
 And I love you
