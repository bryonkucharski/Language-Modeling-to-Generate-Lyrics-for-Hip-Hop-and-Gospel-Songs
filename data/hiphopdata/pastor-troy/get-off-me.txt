What (what), what (what), what (what), what (what) 
 I (i), I (i), I (i), I (i) 
 OK, come on, what 
 (Ludacris and Pastor Troy) 
 What (what), what (what), what (what), what (what) 
 Oh (oh), oh (oh), oh (oh), oh (oh) 
 Get off me, but I'm on you all day 
 Get off me, I don't think you wanna play 
 You wanna rush me, you can't touch me, trust me 
 Cause you way too dusty, and rusty, and musty 
 You better shop that make you pop up from lock up 
 But you tell your folks to hold you're jack up to back up (to back up) 
 I'm ready, so sit down or go ta' your room 
 It ain't nothing 
 A a watch out watch out, boom 
 Call me the hit man, 'cause I make you wanna call time-out 
 Then I make your mom cry-out, when I take your whole spine out 
 Then watch me take ya, and fake ya, and shake ya, and break ya 
 And see you on home to your maker 
 You should give up now for talking shit like that 
 But then you nothing, you garbage you better watch ya' back 
 (OK, OK now) 
 Now it's the Pastor, shook 'em, showing my moves 
 I'm in that 2000 excursion 
 Riding on 22's, I hear the boom 
 But booms just get me more crunk 
 It's the DSGB forever 
 Riding on pump 
 I stunk, or did I say stunk, I meant stank 
 I think I'll take it please, or in another coffee break 
 You ain't, but you can pretend to be homey 
 I'm stiff arming these busters just as soon they get on me
