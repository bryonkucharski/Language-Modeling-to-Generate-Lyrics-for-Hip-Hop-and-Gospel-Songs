(Pastor Troy) 
 Come on 
 D.S.G.B y'all know what time it is 
 Ga y'all know what time it is, 
 Pastor Troy for President for 2000, 
 I'm ready 
 I'm ready 
 I made up my mind to hit the grind and get paid 
 That glock 45 I go to war with all these haters 
 My faith is now greater because I know that I'm the man 
 My package not shaper Qua said they say they didn't understand 
 Together we planned to lock GA on the map 
 And only I can because them other busters sap 
 They claimin' they rap but they lame to me 
 You wanna come strapped it ain't no thang to me 
 Probably gone be laid up in a ditch 
 I'm a kill you, slay your main bitch 
 And oh how quick the game done switched up 
 I'm screaming G-A the crowd screaming what 
 Pa-stor! Pa-stor! Pa-stor! Pa-stor! 
 (I am DSGB!) 
 Pa-stor! Pa-stor! Pa-stor! Pa-stor! 
 (I am DSGB!) 
 Pa-stor! Pa-stor! Pa-stor! Pa-stor! 
 (I am DSGB!) 
 Pa-stor! Pa-stor! Pa-stor! Pa-stor! 
 (I am DSGB!) 
 I ain't playing with these busters I, m rolling village deep.I got Haiti I got 
 Cuba we will shoot you till you flee 
 I'm the leader of the army and Atlanta is the base 
 Let me catch you in my city I'm a shoot you in the face 
 Better tape clothes to your nose 'cause I know I'm the shit 
 Pastor Troy, DSGB I represent for my click 
 Red mouth nobody mouth as red as mine 
 Down south a fifth of Remy and a Georgia Pine 
 Ain't nothing kind when I enter, Doberman pincher I'm pit 
 While you doberman pinching I done locked on ya bitch 
 And just that quick the so called game done switched up 
 I'm screaming G-A the crowd's screaming what 
 Pa-stor! Pa-stor! Pa-stor! Pa-stor! 
 (I am DSGB!) 
 Pa-stor! Pa-stor! Pa-stor! Pa-stor!
