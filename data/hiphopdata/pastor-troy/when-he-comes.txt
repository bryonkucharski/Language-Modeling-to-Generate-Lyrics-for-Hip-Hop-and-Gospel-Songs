 Or playing with yeaa 
 And everything I ever learned as a child 
 Revalations the whole worlds going wild

 Got my pistol, got my bottle, got my warface 
 And if the church is the only place I feel safe 
 But I got faith and I mean real faith 
 Not Faith Evans I'm talking 'bout the faith that places you in heaven 
 When I see the Lord I'ma bow down and shoot a bird at them devils cause its on 
 Now 
 It's on now 
 When he comes 
 No where to run 
 On that day, 
 The world gonna pay 
 When he comes

 Ready to fight yeah 
 And I'm gonna to be right beside him 
 Got my a-k cocked right beside him 
 Behind him yeaaa 
 Nothing but thugs on the Lords side 
 And I was sent to heaven where we reside 
 Ready to ride ain't no mo nickles and dimes primetime 
 Captured for my savors blood yeah the wine

 Better watch ya lanuage son God's Jahovah 
 And when it all over and I am acknowledge 
 To show that I did it and did in college I followed 
 My own, my own soul, the Lion of Judaaa 
 Heavenly father 
 I pray right now 
 For everyone under the 
 Sound of my voice 
 That they come to know you 
 As Lord and Saviour in there lives 
 Help us Lord 
 To understand that you are soon 
 To come for your people 
 And we won't have time to get ready, 
 But must already, be ready. 
 For in the bosom of an eye 
 You shall appear to receive Your all 
 Unto Yourself 
 Our hearts desire Oh Lord 
 Is to be ready when You come 
 Help us Lord to forgive one another 
 Just as you forgave on Calvirage cross 
 Help us to love one another 
 Just as you loved and gave your only son 
 That we shall not perish but shall have 
 Everlasting lives 
 Help us Lord to stand in your righteousness 
 And to ??? every barrier of racial, and ethnic, and social, and economic 
 Devision 
 Help us to see ????????...
