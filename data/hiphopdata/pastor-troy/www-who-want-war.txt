Some gold glock started as Castor (Castor) 
 Naw nigga it's the motherfuckin' Pastor (Pastor) 
 Ready to rapcha 
 Hittin' my slap shift 
 Sumin' of the fifth 
 Let's burn another splif 
 Pussy rowling, ass end of the weed 
 Lick the barel of my motherfuckin' Desert Ease' 
 And they ain't believe I'm on top of shit, straight rock ya shit 
 Ok fuck the props and shit 
 'Cause when it all falls down 
 I'm shooting everybody around 
 You better get down 
 You better take cover 
 It's Pastor Troy I'mma killa motherfucker 
 I just brought the Ferrari, fire red of the lot 
 Damn what kinda money y'all got? 
 And then I heard yo new CD it sound soft 
 Fuck witcha boy PT and Face Off (Face Off nigga) 
 Arrrre (who want war) you reaaaady? (who want war) we ready 
 Arrrre (who want war) you reaaaady? (who want war) we ready 
 Arrrre (who want war) you reaaaady? (who want war) we ready 
 Arrrre (who want war) you reaaaady? (who want war) we ready 
 Verse 2 nigga, yeah 
 Even when I sin catch the first stone 
 Cross the line and get motherfuckin' rolled on 
 (Blow) It's full blown, like motherfuckin' 'nades 
 Hand grenades 
 Mistakes you shouldn't made 
 But you did as a kid, the gun slagga 
 Mom and pops knew I would be a gang banga 
 But I ain't had to rock the red or rock the bluuue 
 I had a mil' before I hit twenty two 
 But look at you, you still workin' all fronts 
 You might as well sell blunts 
 Why don't you go post up in magic city 
 Sale cigars, while I'm tippin' me some tities 
 Naw you can go to LA and ??? 
 You can be the one who parks my Benz 
 If that's even what I'm driving 
 I got so many cars, don't know what to ride (again) 
 I gotta lesson that y'all need to learn 
 Smith and Western, this court is adjourned 
 A bad perm and a seven page rap sheet 
 I came up out the fuckin' suite, now lets see 
 Fifty thousand, in the club wildin' 
 Everythangs free on ya boy PT 
 Ya' see, some out here just have to wait 
 GOD already prepared yo' plate 
 When circumstance, sealed like your last chance 
 Pray to the Lord and help you advance 
 And you can, and you can, and you can 
 And you can, until he comes again 
 To win don't always mean to always come first 
 Don't wanna be first ridin' in a hurst 
 I rather live life, chill with the wife 
 This is my sacrifice (sacrifice)
