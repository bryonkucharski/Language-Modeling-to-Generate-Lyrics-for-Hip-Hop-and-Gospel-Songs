 Verse 1: (Pastor Troy) 
 If I'm ackin up, you better cut of the game 
 I ain't got to say nothing, just have to tell them my name 
 I'm the flame, I got mo' flame then a lighter 
 I ain't trying to be lame, but this ain't nobody fighter 
 The southern writer, the preacher and keep a heater beside 
 Oomp Camp and Pastor Troy we letting it ride 
 So many died, I ain't never been the one for that 
 So now I travel everywhere with mack mack mack 
 I crack heads till I'm fed, and I dodge tricks 
 I cut the game off quick past ninety-six 
 I'm getting sick of the game 
 Just handle my business man 
 I catch ya slippin', I'ma lick ya ass for everything 
 We Ready

 But it ain't nothing, I got some shit to bust up ya sweater 
 Head bussa from Augusta, went to talking about 
 Run up on a muthafucker, then I'm gone pour 'em out 
 I hang with Loco, Dollar Bill, and Baby D 
 I'm screaming ready, muthafucker don't fuck wit me 
 A young gangsta, I grew up with them g's from the south 
 And if it's anger, I'm ready to shuv that in a nigga mouth 
 Bitch it's the devil, better not test me funny 
 Oomp Camp in dis bitch

 My Pastor told me forever represent for my team 
 Make them niggas come clean or bust they head with the beam
