Baby Mama Drama 
 (I Got) Baby Mama Drama 
 She know I don't want her 
 Therefore she give me drama 
 (Repeat 2X) 
 It's a bunch of niggas out there feeling like me 
 Had a baby with a woman but you're not a family 
 She get jealous, get ta trippin', put those **** in the mix 
 Wanna try to get a n***a for whatever she can get 
 I been in the same boat but I'd studyin' 'bout the shit 
 Yeah she still my son Mama, but I ain't gotta take her shit 
 Ever since we been done, I can't ever get no peace 
 Do whatever for my son she still callin' da police 
 So at least now I know she's a gold-diggin' 'ho 
 Now I got other accounts where I'm hidin' all my dough 
 Yeah, she took me back to court and she got disappointed 
 I was payin' three stacks ($3,000/month in child support) 
 Now I only pay $300! 
 (I Got) 
 Chorus: (Repeat 3X) 
 (I Got) Baby Mama Drama 
 Baby Mama Drama (Baby Mama Drama... Baby Mama Drama) 
 She know I don't want her 
 Therefore she give me drama 
 Want to see my son, I don't wanna see his Mom 
 Never shoulda had a child, I was young, I was dumb 
 Ever since she went and filed child support on a n@#$a 
 To myself I made a vow that I won't fuck witcha 
 I want to be close to my son but she killin' it 
 @#$#%@ In my business, she know I ain't feelin' it 
 Thinkin' she gon' sit back and get fat off my grind 
 Must be out her fuckin' mind, she will be in welfare line 
 Know it sound harsh but not as harsh as what she's done to me 
 Like she havin' fun wit me, guess that's how GOD punish me 
 She put me on papers, said that it would make us closer 
 The only thing that's closer is foreclosure... I'll show ya!
