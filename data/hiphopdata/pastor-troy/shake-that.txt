As we proceed to give you what you need. 
 Ray J, Raz B, J- boog, Lil' fizz. 
 It's the official remix! 
 Shorty, shake that ba-dunk-a-dunk-dunk 
 (Keep your eyes on my ba-dunk-a-dunk-dunk) 
 Do it when the beat goes rump-a-bump-bump. 
 (As the dummer boy goes rump-a- pump-pump) 
 Tonight ain't no reason to be lonely cause you know up in the club it's on. 
 You never sleep cause you gettin' that money, 
 I know they got you working all day long. 
 The potrone in the trunk will get you perking. 
 Henney shots will get you hot your thongs. 
 Then I know you'll be ready for the night girl, 
 When the DJ plays this song. 
 Shorty, shake that ba-dunk-a-dunk-dunk 
 (Keep your eyes on my ba-dunk-a-dunk-dunk) 
 Do it when the beat goes rump-a-pump-pump. 
 (As the dummer boy goes ba-rumb-a- pumb-pumb) 
 Shorty, shake that ba-dunk-a-dunk-dunk 
 (Keep your eyes on my ba-dunk-a-dunk-dunk) 
 Do it when the beat goes rump-a-pump-pump.

 Lend me your mind, be my desire. 
 I make you numb like I run in your blood. 
 I can't say I love you but I can show you love. 
 Lay your head on my chest, feel my heart beat.
