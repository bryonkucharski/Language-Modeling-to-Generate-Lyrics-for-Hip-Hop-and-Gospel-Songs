Verse 1: Pastor Troy 
 These niggas asking how I choose to die 
 Just like a muthafucking G is my only reply 
 Hi 7, Mac 11 with the shoulder slang 
 Crank me up, bitch I'm gunning killing everything 
 And my veins pumping nothing but this thug blood 
 Maybe blue nigga, till I'm through nigga, yeah 
 Situation got a nigga bout to self-destruct 
 Better tell them niggas I don't give a fuck 
 I make money, nigga money doesn't make me 
 Guess that's why all these weak niggas hate me 
 And lately I been letting a bunch of shit ride 
 But fuck that where my muthafucking forty-five 
 Hook 2x: (We Ready in background) 
 I sold my soul to the devil for a small price 
 I walk through muthafucking hell screaming thug life 
 And I was asking everybody where the devil hang 
 I got them niggas with me they be talking gang bang 
 Verse 2: Pastor Troy 
 My head gone, 'cause I been on this earth long enuff, 
 In this land of little trust 
 Where all my models and rubs, till I been bottled and brewed 
 And it's been provin' that it ain't shit to prove 
 I move about a gram a so, but clientele won't grow, 
 Until all them basers know, that I keep that butter 
 A new face runs shop with me, said she need a 30 piece 
 But I can't do shit because I think she's undercover 
 My brother doing fed time, so I move nickels and dimes 
 Praying when he comes out I can break him off 
 He taught me all the game, make them boys find our name 
 But from point blank range show them fuckers we ain't soft 
 I lost about a dozen of my cousins, homicide 
 How the hell am I supposed to hide the fucking hurt 
 The many tears I cry, understanding me I tryed 
 Then my cousin came to me and said 'cause go to work 
 Now I'm grinding 
 My timing, perfect, pick a mack and me some clothing 
 The corner stores, the ski masks, the forty-fours 
 Run up on 'em so slick, and get my pistol and click 
 Give me the muthafucking bag or I'm gone buss yo' shit 
 Now I came up, a fifteen thousand dollar lick 
 Yeah Red Mouth, the Pastor need about a brick, and now it's on 
 Strictly, quarters or grams, 
 Them down south georgia boys done blew up on all y'all haters 
 Hook 2x: (We Ready in background) 
 I sold my soul to the devil for a small price 
 I walk through muthafucking hell screaming thug life 
 And I was asking everybody where the devil hang 
 I got them niggas with me they be talking gang bang 
 Verse 3: Pastor Troy 
 I fill my mind with weed, uh, 
 I can't believe my congregation is testing me 
 Retailation would be less than me, 
 While praising me in my face 
 Shit these the same muthafuckers trying to take my place 
 I hate to waste yo blood and leave ya church clothes filthy 
 But believe I will do it without feeling guilty 
 Let's understand though the Pastor, I'm still that nigga 
 Praising the Lord for blessing me with nica triggas, and laser beams 
 And my team, my original team, killers and bandates 
 Try your best to understand it 
 Nigga respect, I demand it 
 I feel its mandatory, 
 I'm popping on these niggas as I give the Lord the glory 
 Like David, My slang shot human made 
 Fuck whirling rocks, nigga my niggas got handgrenades 
 Who paid?, I have laid my life on the line 
 Cops pulling grind, got the Pastor dodging one time 
 Signs of holy wars 
 Touting magnum forty-fours, and forty-fives, mac 11's 
 There's a hundred ways to die 
 Up in the mist, surrounded by these evil men 
 Got to stay hi', 
 Grab the pistol and I let 'em fly, just like hulk 
 So what, I thought you would've never done 
 Nigga you did it and death will be the outcome 
 I sholl hate it but I put up with it long enuff 
 Ashes to ashes, and dust to fucking dust 
 Go head and buss 
 Hook 8x till end: (We Ready in background) 
 I sold my soul to the devil for a small price 
 I walk through muthafucking hell screaming thug life 
 And I was asking everybody where the devil hang 
 I got them niggas with me they be talking gang bang
