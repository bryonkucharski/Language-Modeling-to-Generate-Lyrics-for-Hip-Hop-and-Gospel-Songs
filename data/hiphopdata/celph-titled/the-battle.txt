Time's up, time's up 
 (Yeah) Hold up 
 (All right, that's all you got?) 
 All right, Celph, you got 30 seconds, are you ready? 
 (Yeah) 
 All right, Celph Titled, hit 'em 
 (Verse 1: Celph Titled) 
 Yeah, listen, yo 
 These hungry rappers battle 
 Fora buck and some change 
 There really be kids starving 
 Give a fuck if it change 
 Shot raps, got that, 
 You get signed, you might blow up 
 Release party in Iraq, you might blow up 
 I see you trying to think a few lines 
 You might get at me with 
 Slap happy with babies who born with crack in they cribs 
 Too much to cram under your oversized fitted 
 And the public school system failed you 
 Either you ignorant or you isn't 
 Ain't concerned with scuffing my sneakers 
 My demographic listening 
 But not too many rappers teaching 
 And I find a way to fill a hard drive up 
 With songs containing mainly: bitch, ho, shit fuck 
 Yo, you know what's up 
 There's some ill shit going on 
 So wrong, it's not topics that I've really spoken on 
 I'm just like you, a kid who wants to rap 
 Get money, put an album out, mansion with a fountain spout 
 Out in the front yard, sidewalk leading to the street 
 Which leads me to speak, my speech reaches the whole world 
 And yet still, I'd rather rap about what I got or what I'll do to you 
 If you disrespect, you guessed it, I'm shooting you 
 Who's the true villain and who's illing the mix tape 
 Gun shots ain't really killing, who's dying? It's tough luck 
 Can't figure out if I'm the problem or the world's just fucked up
