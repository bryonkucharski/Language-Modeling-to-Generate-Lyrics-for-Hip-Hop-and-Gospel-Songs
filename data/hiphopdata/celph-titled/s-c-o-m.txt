(Intro: Mike Shinoda) 
 Unh, Shinoda, that's right 
 Ryu, Celph Titled, Demigodz 
 Dipset, Juelz Santana 
 And of course, Fort Minor 
 It's like ohooh 
 D.E.M.I.G.O.D.Z. 
 Like ohooh 
 D.I.P.S.E.T. 
 S.O.B. 
 (Verse 1: Ryu) 
 I came from pumping 60K out the trunk 
 Switchblades Ziggy stuff nicknames, itchy braids, bitchmade 
 Faggots, my shit's changed, my cabbage is picked man 
 Rollin' twenties up like Snoop Doggy dog's crip game 
 But I'm out for the crown, housing, I'm buckin' 'em down 
 Dousing and dunking these fucking punks in a bucket and bounce 
 When I get up in the game beware 
 Put a pimp on a hope and then say your prayers 
 Got this ocean so damn potent player 
 Put you on a floor like a broken chair 
 You know it's a movement crack for the gods and goons 
 We back you talk about gats but don't actually use 'em 
 But I'm happy to do it because this is Demigodz 
 Celph Titled, Ryu with Tak, Apathy stupid 
 (Verse 2: Juelz Santana) 
 From bottom to top (I rose) 
 Chopping them rocks (and o's) 
 Cocking the glock (and go), 
 No more of that 
 Now I just hop in the drop and go 
 To the most popular spots 
 With ho's and they know, there he go 
 I went from pumping that white stuff 
 To being up in them white clubs 
 Like hey, I got thugs still pumping that white stuff 
 Plus I fuck with the white boys, skaters and bike boys 
 We may act different but the struggles alike, boy 
 Shinoda know, if it's a problem I'm coming over, yo 
 Quick fast in a hurry, knock it into overdose 
 And I mean that, just call if you need that 
 The best of both different worlds 
 Not often they see that 
 (Verse 3: Celph Titled) 
 We like these rappers here that you have to fear 
 We smacking queers murder extortion 
 Hustling, nothing stopping this movement 
 I swear we getting to the top this year 
 Got your ears, all eyes on me, old school 80's guy, that's me 
 Hip hop head female rappers give me dome 
 And That's just that hip hop head, flip off the feds, it's been said 
 I'm out my mind to the fullest, alone in the crib bugging 
 Fucking with Russian roulette with six bullets 
 Won't never free my guns but for show we letting them triggers go 
 Sparking that weapon, yous a thousand miles from me 
 You far from perfection and that's just food for thought 
 I'm moving the bar, rap entrepreneur, rap lord 
 Come to the hood, I'll bring you in through that trap door 
 It's Demigodz and it's Dipset, it's Doe Rakers and it's Bird Gang 
 That's Ryu, Celph and Santana, 
 The best rap singers you ever done heard sing
