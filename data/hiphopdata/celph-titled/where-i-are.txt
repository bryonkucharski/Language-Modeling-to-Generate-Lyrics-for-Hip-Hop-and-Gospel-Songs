"It's like that y'all (that y'all), like that" 
 So why they hatin' on Celph Titled? 
 "I don't know man, I don't know man, I don't know man, I don't know, I don't know" - A Tribe Called Quest 'Oh My God' 
 "'Cause they wanna be where I are, 'cause they wanna be where I are" - Grand Puba 'I Like It' 
 [Verse One]: 
 Star spangled from harsh angles 
 Bow and arrow arch aimed at your Randy Savage wave cap 
 Your budget I ate that 
 I'm the new Pat Sajak 
 They asked me for a couple letters so my AK spat (multiple) 
 Hollow head heat seakers at your weak features 
 Like Data from the Goonies with unique sneakers 
 I'ma slide past wack shit with highly extensive combat shit on compact disk 
 Don't worry if I'm burning your album 
 'Cause if I'm burning your album, I'm in the backyard burning the album (oh yeah) 
 Smokey The Bear will have to choke on a flare 
 Am I supposed to be scared? 
 That's like Vin Diesel combing his hair 
 Ain't happenin' now 
 No, not, not forever 
 Not a rapper with a better flow, what-so-ever 
 All these biters ride my nuts like a road rail 
 They wish I had seat belts embedded in my coat tails 
 So why they hatin' on Celph Titled? 
 "I don't know man, I don't know man, I don't know man, I don't know, I don't know" - A Tribe Called Quest 'Oh My God'

 [Verse Two]: 
 I first appeared on wax in '98 as a young teen 
 Now I'm stackin' paper, got my thumb green 
 How many times am I fresh? That's umteen 
 Get dirty, pull the trigger, but I keep my gun clean 
 That's sparkly shinin', yeah the glittery bling 
 Vocals so big, the Pro-Tools need a 50 inch screen 
 Hardcore rhymes, jazz riffs and loops 
 I think y'all forgot what rap sounded like didn't you? 
 Let me remind you of a time way back 
 When hip hop tracks had hard snares and not lame snaps 
 Rappers where rappers, drug dealers were dealers 
 Fans was just fans and the music was just realer 
 Now it's a clown show 
 Except these faggots got a dope boy persona instead of the damn clown nose 
 I laugh at any critic saying my style is too humorous 
 'Cause you're an insecure boy with an abused uterus 
 So why they hatin' on Celph Titled? 
 "I don't know man, I don't know man, I don't know man, I don't know, I don't know" - A Tribe Called Quest 'Oh My God'

 [Verse Three]: 
 I get slept on heavily 
 But I'm an expert with rap whether it be Heavy D or Heather B 
 I've heard all the beats, all the cuts, all the breaks 
 All the flow from all the legends in cities, state to state 
 I'm an ace when I study the science of spit 
 Respect my skill for the one of a kind that it is 
 Put behind all the early shit you heard of mine 
 That was before I flipped and decided it was murder time 
 I stepped my game up, my cadence is impeccable 
 Lyrics are out of this world, swagger is incredible 
 And if you can't see that 
 Then you're probably a rapper yourself wishin' you could be where I'm at (man) 
 Don't you herbs notice? You can't disturb my focus 
 My words are so sick that they leave you with tuberculosis 
 If your CD has 15 songs, word is born it's about 15 songs too long 
 "Just give me my fuckin' phone call."
