(Verse 1: Guttamouf) 
 Yeah, haha, we a'int nothing buta psychotic mother fuckers in here 
 I'm a equal opportunity cap buster 
 White, black, Spanish, it don't matter 
 Sixteen make you cough up your gall bladder 
 Even if you a bitch, it means no different 
 It doesn't matter if you wear bullet resistant 
 I smack mother fuckers and leave barrel imprints 
 I represent the mentally unstable 
 Who usually end up dead or in jail 
 While you get your coffin, I get lunch with Lucifer 
 Had breakfast with the grim reaper 
 Treat your body to a led diet 
 If you don't shut the fuck up and be quiet 
 I'm God's gift to your mother fucking photo 
 Spit on your photo, shit on your promo 
 With me running around, get a bullet proof do-rag 
 Portable IV and a mother fucking shit bag 
 (Chorus: Celph Titled) 
 Pull out the heat, it's about to get dirty 
 No more rap shit, just heavy artillery 
 We the type of niggas that's quick to blow your mug off 
 Serving mother fuckers beat downs with extra thug sauce 
 Pull out the heat, it's about to get dirty 
 No more rap shit, just heavy artillery 
 We the type of niggas that's quick to blow your mug off 
 Serving mother fuckers beat downs with extra thug sauce 
 (Verse 2: Majik Most) 
 Ay yo, I'm coming to your city and I'll probably be 
 Rolling with a posse that will eat a homeless woman's pussy 
 While playing Pavarotti they'll be fishing your body 
 Out of Lake Erie in Michigan 
 With a Michelin tire wrapped around your midsection 
 I'm stepping on your corpse with a quart of your blood 
 All over my corduroys 
 While I bring the noise and, strict nine and poisons 
 Yeah, the type of shit I spit will leave you hollow in side 
 So mother fuck rap cats who can't get live 
 I'm kicking hardcore lyrics till the age of 85 
 Until I retire, I'm only getting nicer 
 I'll slam your fucking face down on a deli slicer 
 You're crazy shook, rocking a Kevlar vest 
 A bullet took your head off and left a little piece of your neck 
 I need respect, I'm taking shit higher 
 Make you firearm backfire and light your arm on fire 
 You stupid bitch 
 (Chorus: Celph Titled) 
 Pull out the heat, it's about to get dirty 
 No more rap shit, just heavy artillery 
 We the type of niggas that's quick to blow your mug off 
 Serving mother fuckers beat downs with extra thug sauce 
 Pull out the heat, it's about to get dirty 
 No more rap shit, just heavy artillery 
 We the type of niggas that's quick to blow your mug off 
 Serving mother fuckers beat downs with extra thug sauce 
 (Verse 3: Celph Titled) 
 Watch how I run through your clique 
 And straight kill every homeboy 
 Y'all niggas softer than the Pillsbury doughboy 
 Fucking faggot, you eat dick nuggets and love it 
 Watching a Richard Simmons tape 
 And jack off after you dub it 
 Celph Titled is known to leave heads severally bleeding 
 And keep crack heads on my block fiending 
 If your rhymes are poisonous, I'll make you eat your words 
 My gun talk money, imagine all the heat you could earn 
 Record a joint with me featuring you getting beat the fuck up 
 In a sound booth with a busted mics in front of your fucking wife 
 Rocking prosthetic limbs, your crew copped the boot leg 
 Call the police, you all shook daddy, nigga we two feds 
 Ain't another spic realer than me 
 I give a fuck about hip hop, I'm just in it for cheese 
 And if this music don't work, I'll just find another hustle 
 You probably hate me for saying that shit so I say fuck you 
 I kick rhymes on mad records just 'cause I can 
 You wish to spit bars on vinyl, but you'll never have fans 
 By the time you get a chance to have your first single out 
 My discography is countless with six figure amounts 
 The God Celph Titled, contested by no one 
 Niggas want to bring it, you can catch me at a show, dun 
 Fuck that, son who, gun you, 
 Look what I done to, young crews that tried to come through 
 Niggas owe me loot, they turn up like rafts and canoes 
 I'm laughing at dude for thinking he as raw as my crew 
 From the NY boroughs and alleys to Hillsborough County 
 My name ring bells like free phone sex rallies 
 The Rubix Cuban, unsolvable 
 Shoot out the voice box of emcees and leave them inaudible 
 An entrepreneur, your crew rocking my line of body bags 
 In the Chrome Depot, we got shopping bags full of gats 
 (Chorus: Celph Titled) 
 Pull out the heat, it's about to get dirty 
 No more rap shit, just heavy artillery 
 We the type of niggas that's quick to blow your mug off 
 Serving mother fuckers beat downs with extra thug sauce 
 Pull out the heat, it's about to get dirty 
 No more rap shit, just heavy artillery 
 We the type of niggas that's quick to blow your mug off 
 Serving mother fuckers beat downs with extra thug sauce
