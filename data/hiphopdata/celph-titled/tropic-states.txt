(Intro: Tino Vega) 
 Yeah, yo, yo new start baby, what 
 Genix, all day every day, atomic, hard head baby 
 (Verse 1: Tino Vega) 
 Yo, yo, ay, yo in this two triple 0 spitting fire flow 
 Through your team photos and hit me up 
 Don't give them Tampa hos a dime, they be shiesty 
 Awful pricey, acting like they too hot for polar icees 
 They want their diamond watches now, smell the power 
 Watch me peel out, on a nigga dollar mountain biking 
 You heard what jigga said right, get to bouncing 
 Catch a cab or take a city bus ride or something 
 No blunt puffing for you, what happened to you 
 You used to be battle-able, this tragedy sounded very true 
 See that chick in the berry blue skirt, she called me a jerk 
 For working the wars too long, I had her on her knees and palms 
 Screaming my song for treating me wrong 
 The groupie soon to be singing along 
 It takes not long at all just to feel what I'm on 
 And Celph putting me on 
 (And that's the type of shit we on) 
 (Verse 2: RK) 
 Ay, you it's RK, running to kill 
 Not your everyday run of the mill emcee 
 That's running the field with guns full of steel 
 Navigating the globe with a compass and shield 
 I don't fumble for real, run though block stumbling steel 
 While rupturing shield and crumpling heels 
 Living large, dog, but I'm still hungry for mills 
 I was summoned for skill but let niggas know, lord is coming for real 
 Covered in teal, with hundreds of pills, 'cause we popping at will 
 We mad enough to pop shots at your bill 
 And in the meantime, we shopping for deals 
 With lots of appeal, I got to rhyme like a klepto has to steal 
 I spit more heat than a glock in your grill 
 Noting I got is concealed, easily seen like you watching a film 
 Everything I spit they dropping it real 
 My words are like motion pictures grubbing for mills 
 RK the hip hop equivalent of Steven Speil 
 (Verse 3: Murdock) 
 Ay, yo we make it happen, never slacking up on the macking 
 I'm in the money trap in a platinum plaque, jacking 
 Don't get caught slipping, mic ripping and cris sipping 
 32 glocks spitting infinite rounds when I start flipping 
 I ain't tripping, leave your faggoty poverty stricken 
 My clique will stay shitting and passing out verbal ass whippings 
 Whether air max, air Jordan's or Bo Jackson, never relax 
 And catch a reaction asking for action 
 It's Murdock, I know that you hate that I'm rapping 
 Cocky and jaw clapping cheesing and cheek smacking 
 You in the club acting, talking about y'all clapping 
 Ran up on the real, got dropped and ain't know what happened 
 (Verse 4: Primetyme) 
 I'm impossible to burn like TV dinners, impossible to document 
 You might as well do a project on Blair Witches 
 Impossible to cross like barbed wired fences 
 Impossible to peel off like dentures, once I'm hard in your grill like dentists 
 While you struggle that, I'm juggling bowling pins and play tennis 
 Some say that I'm cocky and arrogant 
 Some say my genius is like the shit hidden in Roswell with other evidence 
 You all bitch like feminists injected with extra estrogen 
 I don't play no more, that went out with little league baseball 
 A high intelligence, you ain't ready for what I got in store 
 Further more, you don't compare to me, not even barely 
 I have you hiding in the attic with Anne Frank and her family 
 (Verse 5: Dutchmassive) 
 Listen when I speak, your whole crew's delivery is weak 
 Fuck peace, I want beef, let's take it to the streets 
 I eat your whole squad and spit out odd dismembered globs of kids 
 Who acting hard and got they body frame scarred 
 You jumping out of cars, we jumping out of planes, survive the impact 
 And gat you on a subway train (train, train) the Dutchmassive motto 
 Finish the whole bottle, get weeded and leave your chest hollow 
 Hollering at whores you hang around with, the loudest pipers in the club 
 (No doubt, kid) Mega hard junk planet bombard your stereo, scenario 
 F-L-A team get the dinero 
 (Verse 6: Celph Titled) 
 When Celph Titled and the track collide 
 You see worldwide action 
 International united chrome passion, 
 Apocalyptic impact that make your bones quiver 
 My sixth sense is to rob from holy water rivers 
 And all them other niggas 
 That don't speak the truth about the God supreme, 
 A sala to bomb regime 
 Poly-ing with aolites up in the synagogue 
 Accurate to details, minus the etcetera 
 My father told me to bust first, remain calm 
 And recited words you'll find in the same song 
 Unique wisdom, centennial prophesies 
 8-1-3 monopoly, my Vietnam philosophy 
 (Verse 7: Vocab) 
 Sometimes I might bust first depending on my mood 
 Whether I'm bent or sober, or just laying in a coma 
 My girl standing next to me saying it's over 
 But the only one who could judge me is Jehovah 
 He was there when I was O-D'd in a coma 
 My whole world was frozen, thought I was one of the chosen 
 My life was only worth what you holding 
 A blue beeper and a dime sack of reefer 
 20 dollars in my wallet and not a damn cent of profit 
 Sick and tired of living this way, I've got to make it 
 They legislate rules so I could break it 
 10, 20, fuck life, I've got to kill niggas to make it 
 And your boy going to eat, so don't get it mistaken 
 I'm trying to count hundos until my wrist be shaking
