(Sample-Looped Chorus] [x2) 
 "Dem no like me and me no like dem 
 Dem a me enemy, me an dem no friend" 
 (Scratch Chorus] [x2) 
 "Ready to smack the dog shit outta them" 
 (Vocal Sample) 
 "Demolish and polish (Who?) God damn!" 
 Verse One] [Celph Titled: 
 (Fannn-fuckin-tastic), crashin' through ya wall like The Kool-Aid Man 
 The suit cost eight grand 
 Murderous clans that grabbed purses and ran 
 Ain't shit 'cause with bare hands I disassemble conversion vans 
 My Hell's Wind Staff blows limbs back 
 I won't spit tracks with wick-wack cliques that come with less than ten stacks 
 Yeah the price went up, bakin' cupcakes 
 And if I told you what was in 'em you would probably throw the icing up 
 Hyphen-fuck-slash, you kickin' that Balderdash 
 This is how you 'sposed to rap, I'm where you should focus at 
 Chicka-chicka-check, me and Trigga Treach 
 Triple the torture, torch ya when you intercept a Intratec 
 Intercept text messages, collect "Evidence" 
 Like a Dilated Peoples box set, get upset, turn ya top red 
 I'm a hot head, swing a rock in a sock net 
 Cop the Swisher from Achmed, let the glock spread 
 Put you in a box dead, carnivore, half animal 
 Acupuncture treatments from the splinters in my axe handle 
 Blast ammmo when I mash out 
 'Cause when I lash out, I rip eye lashes out 
 (Sample-Looped Chorus] [x2) 
 "Dem no like me and me no like dem 
 Dem a me enemy, me an dem no friend" 
 (Scratch Chorus] [x2) 
 "Ready to smack the dog shit outta them" 
 (Vocal Sample) 
 "God damn!" 
 Verse Two] [Treach: 
 Trigga Treach... 
 Known for rippin' the raps, grippin' the gats, nippin' ya naps 
 Fuck around and get kidnapped, slip and get slapped 
 You'll be worth a handsome ransom, tied in the camper 
 By some hip hop Black Panthers from Tampa 
 Puttin' paws to ya jaws, how ya feel now? 
 Plus you know we throw that steal 'round in Illtown 
 Pil-pow, nigga-naps, nuh-Naughty style 
 Watch ya turn the strippers 'round the .40 cal 
 Gritty pile, plenty stacks, 60 pounds 
 Handin' out my mini-Mac, 50 rounds 
 A negro without an ego, desert eagle stay low 
 You play bro and be spinnin' in the air like a tornado 
 NATO, couldn't save ya, pray a minute, pause 
 Ya gone now thanks to Treach and The Demigodz 
 These demographics are drastic, ya bastard 
 Mastered the ass-kiss, show ya ass and get smacked quick 
 (Sample-Looped Chorus] [x2) 
 "Dem no like me and me no like dem 
 Dem a me enemy, me an dem no friend" 
 (Scratch Chorus] [x2) 
 "Ready to smack the dog shit outta them" 
 (Vocal Sample) 
 "To come exact with the stupified rap" 
 Verse Three] [Celph Titled: 
 Sneak attack entourage, barrage of shooters on deck 
 That move with a set, pull a tool in a sec, imagine what we do to ya rep 
 (I'm sayin') dissect with a chainsaw, not a Katana blade 
 My problems make the common state of your heart rate complicate 
 The voice of god, colder than a oyster bar 
 The boy been hard, like Hasselhoff hoistin' Deutsche Marks 
 For Naughty fanatics I'm bringin' Ali Baba back 
 Holy magician bringin' that Dalai Lama rap 
 Send bengals who will mangle you 
 Leave you in the wild I'll serve you as bengal food 
 Aim and shoot, with every word that we speak 
 Tell 'em Treach we gon' 
 Treach: 
 Smack 'em, call 'em burgundy cheeks 
 Biatch!
