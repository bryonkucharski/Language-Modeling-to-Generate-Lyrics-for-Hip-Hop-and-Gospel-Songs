Watch out 
 He's coming 
 He's coming 
 (Verse 1: Cashmere) 
 I know the freshest way to move you 
 Put so much dope in the flow 
 Before I release a single, I need FDA approval 
 You stepped this way to do who? 
 It's best you stay in neutral 
 I've got explosives from comp 
 I eject in they Izuzu 
 Calicos that shred away they FUBU 
 And leave you with a penetrated noodle 
 When I elevate the two-two 
 See when I play its brutal 
 You stepping to a 300 pound wolf 
 And yous just a feather weighted poodle 
 I won't hesitate to do you 
 Fill those properties 
 The most evil philosophy 
 Since Satan's spirit went inside of Socrates 
 That can lead to more monstrosities 
 Possibly 'cause when you rock the ozone 
 It's like the crowd turned into apostrophes 
 (Cashmere) 
 Make no thing about it 
 It's got to be, behind this cubic 
 Is only way you'll be on top of me 
 Dough I'm constantly striving to cop the suit to rob with me 
 Honestly, I'm so sick I need the CDC to market me 
 And that's the Bronx in me, taunting me 
 To big nigga shit, wig splitter shit 
 Want to hear a peaceful joint, this isn't it 
 I'm not happy unless I'm paid and this is a bliss 
 Then I gets ignorant, so expect it lord 
 There be at least two red corners like a checkerboard 
 The rest are floored, no way to detect the raw 
 My album bang, by the last track, your neck get sore 
 (Clap, don't applaud) 
 (When I rap, don't wait to clap, applaud sooner) 
 (Make 'em clap to this) 
 (Clap, don't applaud) 
 (Make 'em clap to this) 
 (Thought I clapped guns, but my guns applaud) 
 (Clap, don't applaud) 
 (When I rap, don't wait to clap, applaud sooner) 
 (Make 'em clap to this) 
 (Clap, don't applaud) 
 (Make 'em clap to this) 
 (Thought I clapped guns, but my guns applaud) 
 (Verse 2: Oktober) 
 Yo, there's a lot of guns clapping from city to city nowadays 
 Thugs are gritty and willing to go out in a blaze 
 Late night, guns go pop where the violence is 
 Wake the whole block, we can't afford silencers 
 Popping out here with gun play 
 Even model bitches get clapped in the Time Square subway 
 In broad day, popping for thousands to witness 
 Get clapped shopping in the diamond district 
 I stared down the barrel of my uncle's rifle 
 He had a scope on it with a little red light too 
 My crew used to bring guns to Catholic school 
 Shirt and tie with a 22 strapped to the shoe 
 Nah, I don't even hit kids, kill them rugrats 
 Wait until they get big so they can feel the gun clap 
 If you decide to cross the line that your life is on 
 You better be holding and I don't mean a microphone 
 (Clap, don't applaud) 
 (When I rap, don't wait to clap, applaud sooner) 
 (Make 'em clap to this) 
 (Clap, don't applaud) 
 (Make 'em clap to this) 
 (Thought I clapped guns, but my guns applaud) 
 (Clap, don't applaud) 
 (When I rap, don't wait to clap, applaud sooner) 
 (Make 'em clap to this) 
 (Clap, don't applaud) 
 (Make 'em clap to this) 
 (Thought I clapped guns, but my guns applaud) 
 (Verse 3: Celph Titled) 
 I'm a real live loose cannon with a loose cannon 
 Explosive genius, making bombs out of tooth laminate 
 Walked into the church and let my mother fucking gun spray 
 Pissed the fuck off cause Chic-Fil-A's closed on Sunday's 
 Back up my life and then easily delete yours 
 Go against the grain like I got beef with a feed store 
 Locked in the bing, I'm sticking CO's with oxes 
 Should have been a postal worker, putting PO's in boxes 
 My hands write murderous notebooks 
 So Jehovah took those so shook soldiers 
 Who claim they so hard but ain't no crooks 
 My face turn green from the light in the night scope 
 In grassy knolls and hoods, right next to the white folks 
 I got you walking tight ropes, you might hope 
 That Celph Titled is not who he seems to be 
 I eagerly wait with heaters with beams aimed deeply 
 Where your people be 
 Your local eatery's not safe no more 
 Until my desert eagle sprays no more 
 (Clap, don't applaud) 
 (When I rap, don't wait to clap, applaud sooner) 
 (Make 'em clap to this) 
 (Clap, don't applaud) 
 (Make 'em clap to this) 
 (Thought I clapped guns, but my guns applaud) 
 (Clap, don't applaud) 
 (When I rap, don't wait to clap, applaud sooner) 
 (Make 'em clap to this) 
 (Clap, don't applaud) 
 (Make 'em clap to this) 
 (Thought I clapped guns, but my guns applaud) 
 (Celph Titled) Yeah, Celph Titled, the mother fucking rubix Cuban 
 (Oktober) Yeah, Oktober the zero, about to pass the heat to Cashmere 
 Yo, Cash, don't leave that laying around, you know how we do, you know how Celph start acting with them things, haha 
 (Celph Titled) Noah on the mother fucking beat, yeah, we going to make 'em clap to this one, Tampa to the BX, p-on and all that, you know what I mean, let's do this shit, watch your neck piece.
