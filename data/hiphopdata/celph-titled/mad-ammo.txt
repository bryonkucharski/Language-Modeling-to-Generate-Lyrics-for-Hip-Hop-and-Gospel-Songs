(Intro Hook - Vocal Sample] [x4) 
 "You know I love the way it's goin' down (goin' down)" 
 (Talking Intro) 
 Uh 
 (Yeah, Stand Out... Celph Titled... FT!) 
 Rugged Man, Buckwild... Let's do it! 
 Chorus] [Celph Titled: 
 ("Uh-uh-oh") These rappers better watch out 
 'Cause we the livest in the house, boy without a doubt 
 ("Uh-uh-oh") And y'ain't know what this about 
 We got a hundred rounds, bitch we ain't come to talk it out 
 ("Uh-uh-oh") Yeah we party hard like Mardi Gras 
 And body y'all without a muthafuckin' bodyguard 
 ("Uh-uh-oh") Everybody face gettin' scarred 
 Play with God and you gon' come face to face with a shark 
 Verse One] [FT: 
 Haters be tryin' to keep F a secret 
 Eat dick, I'm not the one to beef with 
 Peep this, dog, you gon' rest in pieces 
 For actin' like Sylvester, Garfield, Heathcliff 
 Pussy MC's I run through yo' shit 
 Like a untrained blue-nosed pit who won't quit 
 Foamin' at the mouth cause the bitch is sick 
 I'm screamin' six words: Fuck you and suck my dick! 
 You will get served steppin' to me 
 I guarantee you gon' see somethin' you probably'd never would see 
 On top is where I'm destined to be 
 Stop yappin', I make you quit rappin' indefinitely 
 And I make hits effortlessly, Mr. F-to-the-T 
 Is gettin' money, smokin' medicine leaves 
 To be honest it's a deadly disease 
 I'm way ahead of my league, layin' verses for incredible fees 
 I got a incredible flow, competitors know 
 Not to ask for a chance, I'm not lettin' it go 
 Give me money, cash and ass instead of the blow 
 You gon' make me spaz and smash yo' head in the do', fool 
 Chorus] [Celph Titled: 
 ("Uh-uh-oh") These rappers better watch out 
 'Cause we the livest in the house, boy without a doubt 
 ("Uh-uh-oh") And y'ain't know what this about 
 We got a hundred rounds, bitch we ain't come to talk it out 
 ("Uh-uh-oh") Yeah we party hard like Mardi Gras 
 And body y'all without a muthafuckin' bodyguard 
 ("Uh-uh-oh") Everybody face gettin' scarred 
 Play with God and you gon' come face to face with a shark 
 Verse Two] [Celph Titled: 
 Double barrel from my vocal booth, I shoot with both lungs 
 Find me in Beirut with blow guns, I'm Babe Ruth with home runs 
 You're a crackhead with base hits 
 Preachin' to the choir like Mase did 
 They put a price on my head, I asked 'em how much it was 
 Told 'em find the guy who put the hit, and I'll double it up 
 No you can't run circles around us, triangular force 
 BUCK, one round each 
 Bring war like a rudeboy shotta, steel alloy binoculars 
 Peepin' ya movements, (Why's he abusive?) 
 'Cause it's easy to do it 
 Have ya jaw wired, now a straw's required to eat some soup shit 
 Bitches get souped quick, wanna know how the meat taste 
 On a man focused on his briefcase 
 Haagen-Das cheesecake at fancy restaurants 
 Even my chicken breast got a bulletproof vest on 
 Chorus] [Celph Titled: 
 ("Uh-uh-oh") These rappers better watch out 
 'Cause we the livest in the house, boy without a doubt 
 ("Uh-uh-oh") And y'ain't know what this about 
 We got a hundred rounds, bitch we ain't come to talk it out 
 ("Uh-uh-oh") Yeah we party hard like Mardi Gras 
 And body y'all without a muthafuckin' bodyguard 
 ("Uh-uh-oh") Everybody face gettin' scarred 
 Play with God and you gon' come face to face with a shark 
 Verse Three] [RA The Rugged Man: 
 Mic check one to the two-a, baby I'mma do ya 
 And act like I never knew ya, I'm a dirtbag loser, use ya, abuse ya 
 You better pray I don't choose ya, I'll bloody you and bruise ya 
 Take you off the streets and recruit ya, you money makin', it's ya money I'm takin' 
 Takin' ya cake and cookin' ya crack and get it shakin' and bakin' 
 You basically basin' since 80's and Ronald Reagan 
 Wigga-wack, jaw crack, sugar pop, dig 'em smack 
 See me rip a track, young hoes sippin' similak 
 Bring it back, I'm shovin' pipes up the asses of dykes 
 Fuck women's rights, I got more pussy on me than hermaphrodites 
 You hear what I'm doin'? Then say no more 
 I can smash you with punchlines from '94 
 Swing, chop, bloody axe, I'm sendin' bodies to their graves 
 I'm the proof to the theory that white men come from caves 
 Opposite of pacifist, if you Catholic I'm like a nun with a ruler 
 Slappin' ya wrist, I'm hazardous when I'm packin' the cannon 
 I'm back in this bitch, Rugged Man, is he man or a myth? 
 Is he baggin' ya chick, is he punchin' or is his stamina sick? 
 Buck he always stayed street, I was down with Buck in the early 90's 
 When he was puttin' sleigh bells in every beat 
 I'm like do that, ya hookers for cover 'cause I'm like more than High Strung 
 I get slightly dumb, how many styles have I begun, come on!
