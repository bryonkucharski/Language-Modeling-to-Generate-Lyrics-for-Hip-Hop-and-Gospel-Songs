(Verse 1: Apathy) 
 Yeah... 
 I'm like a '88 classic, Apathy goes back 
 To Fila's with straps and Don Mattingly throwbacks 
 I'm back bitch, on some asshole rap shit 
 Rarely ever seen like Asian dudes with black chicks 
 You muthafuckas wanna scrap? Be quiet! 
 You know when Apathy drops, you happily buy it 
 All these cats are a riot, wanna rap, so they try it 
 But'll quit as quick as Ruben Studdard on the Atkins diet 
 I ain't the type to blow scratch on tricks 
 Slap tricks in the trap if teeth scratch the dick 
 Chicken's in the kitchen makin' chicken from scratch and shit 
 Check it, Chum's on the track with the scratch and mix 
 Y'all don't even understand who you scrappin' with 
 I got Timbs in the trunk, won't scratch my kicks 
 Y'all are brewin' up a plot, tryin' to get Ap to flip? 
 Do yourself a favor - scratch that shit, 'cause... 
 Even though muthafuckas tryin' to see me... 
 "Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me" <- Jay-Z 
 The way I think, I make it look easy 
 "Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me" <- Jay-Z 
 You got doubts, but please believe me 
 "Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me" <- Jay-Z 
 Go ask your mom to cop this CD 
 "Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me" <- Jay-Z 
 (Verse 2: Celph Titled) 
 The Rubix Cuban's at your door, but I ain't singin' no carols 
 I'm like Donkey Kong, I got you niggaz dodgin' my barrels 
 Don't give a fuck where your label's from 
 We runnin' up in your office, holdin' your CEO hostage with a staple gun 
 And ain't no stoppin' this don; I got soccer moms 
 Puttin' glocks in their palms and wildin' out to opera songs 
 Blow off your brim, turn your fitted to a kufi 
 I'm like Ricky Ricardo except, "I Love Uzis" 
 When I'm in the crowd, these rappers are shook 
 They won't stage dive unless they got a harness with a grapplin' hook 
 Damn right, my raps are real ill 
 The Celph Titled talkin' doll says, "Kill, kill" 
 Oh, you's a tough guy, sayin' that you brawl in these fights? 
 But you got your nose broken by a white bitch from a volleyball spike 
 Old timers ask me where I got my pimp game from 
 'Cause I got 99 bitches and ain't a problem with one 
 (Verse 3: Ryu) 
 I'm the one to call when your third verse is free 
 Slip slugs in a pump and disperse emcees 
 Six gunner with a potty mouth, spittin' up mud 
 I stay trippin' with a 40 oz., sippin' them suds 
 Outta Cali with a bang, bitch! Fuckin' insane, bitch 
 The man savin' L.A., forget about Game, bitch 
 I never claim Crip, but I'll murder my language 
 If I can't handle it quick, I'll have it arranged then 
 Last nine summers, you been suckin' the same dick 
 But Jay's gone, and I'm still fuckin' 'em brainless 
 At the Holiday Inn, my Doc Holiday grins 
 A little too much for one, so I'll probably get twins 
 Let the party begin, take it back to the telly 
 Your body is doper than coke, but your crack is smelly 
 At the show, they was rippin' all their panties and bras down 
 They love it, 'cause officially I'm one of the godz now
