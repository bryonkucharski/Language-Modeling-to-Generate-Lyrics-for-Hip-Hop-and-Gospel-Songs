Another Celph Titled motherfuckin' banger! 
 Bllllllllaaaaat! 
 [Scratch Chorus]: 
 "I do damage but still I manage to lay low 
 Actual fact, (why black?) 
 'Cause I say so" 
 "Run for cover" 
 "They say I'm outta control" 
 "Run for cover" 
 "But I don't give a fuck though" - Lord Finesse 'You Know What I'm About' 
 [Verse One]: 
 You thought I was but I wasn't 
 I wasn't what you thought 
 I was what "wasn't" is or has ever been brought 
 From unknown dimensions (yep) 
 But did I mention I have 30 henchmen 
 Up in my infantry since infants 
 And that's how we get down, get down, get down my brother 
 If hip hop's dead then close the casket fucker 
 Get wrapped in barb wired, face down in car tires 
 Gat Super Soakers like a bond fire 
 I got more fire (what?) 
 Like a bat outta Hell fire, flyin', buyin' dark shades, sippin' white Zinfandel 
 R.I.P. Big L 
 You set the standard for my frame of lyricism 
 Say a name and my missiles hit 'em 
 Boom, bang, pow 
 Yeah, all of that stuff 
 Bitch, you couldn't fit my dick in a Mac truck 
 So I came back from the dead with loose screws 
 And beats with horns that sound somethin' like a moose screw (huh?) 
 I'm quite exquisite with it 
 I'm naughty kill it skillet 
 I'm on some Tretch and Tim Dog, Penicillin shit (damn) 
 I'm '92 Nasty Nas and Akinyele, '88 Daddy Kane 
 2070 Makaveli 
 My swordsmen specialize in contortion 
 Torture chamber in the same garage that I park my Porsche in 
 And dead bodies, chuck 'em in the bay 
 And I'ma summon Satan every time I hear Justin Timberlake 
 Mad as fuck 
 That's how I've been since the beginnin' 
 Don't know why, but I hate everything livin' 
 I got a problem, yeah, I got a problem 
 Blllaaaat, to your noggin' 
 Face flat in the coffin 
 You think you got issues, I got issues 
 I'm mad as fuck so of course I'm gonna diss you 
 You think you got issues, I got issues 
 I'm mad as fuck so of course I'm gonna diss you 
 [Verse Two]: 
 I'm mad as fuck so of course I'm gonna diss y'all 
 The shit I pulled off in this game takes big balls 
 I'm a rap star from two different rap crews 
 A pale skin Cuban who's mistaken for a black dude 
 Cause my thunderous voice is deep on the mic 
 Sometimes it's Barry White sometimes it's Jesus Christ 
 Sometimes I'm eatin' mice like hungry pet snakes 
 That song with me and Juelz, my favorite Dipset tape 
 You should have copped it, if you didn't, hope you die slow 
 Starve you till your ribs touch, time to give you lipo 
 I'm mad nice though 
 (Right, that's fo' sho' homie) 
 I'm with your wife tho' 
 (Oh, fo' sho' she's gon' blow me) 
 And I'm an O.G., in underground rap circles 
 I took it all over, just look at a map Erkle (you see that?) 
 I'ma murk you, but not right now 
 (I'll lay you in the intersection with the stop lights out) 
 Mad as fuck 
 That's how I've been since the beginnin' 
 Don't know why, but I hate everything livin' 
 I got a problem, yeah, I got a problem 
 Blllaaaat, to your noggin' 
 Face flat in the coffin 
 You think you got issues, I got issues 
 I'm mad as fuck so of course I'm gonna diss you 
 You think you got issues, I got issues 
 I'm mad as fuck so of course I'm gonna diss you 
 [Verse Three]: 
 Splatter paint shotgun shells, look what my pellets made 
 I give opponents hellish fades with a propeller blade 
 Rockin' a ninja mask and infrared glasses 
 Lookin' really stupid, but really I'm right under your mattress 
 Keys to the safe, Desert Eagles and duct tape 
 I'm takin' e'rything down to your last cupcake 
 Motherfucker I got million dollar plans whether in or out of hand 
 You should just holler at me, I got you fam 
 No wack records to my track record 
 I'm takin' Hell so you can have Heaven 
 Smack you if you half steppin' 
 I'm givin' math lessons at spelling bees 
 With a big black weapon if you don't fuckin' spell Celph with a "C" 
 There's only one way to go out 
 So I'm goin' out of my way to do sign language with hand grenades 
 My sharp teeth are like Ginsu diamonds 
 Y'all ain't men with Heisman, y'all are just men with hymens 
 Mad as fuck 
 That's how I've been since the beginnin' 
 Don't know why, but I hate everything livin' 
 I got a problem, yeah, I got a problem 
 Blllaaaat, to your noggin' 
 Face flat in the coffin 
 You think you got issues, I got issues 
 I'm mad as fuck so of course I'm gonna diss you 
 You think you got issues, I got issues 
 I'm mad as fuck so of course I'm gonna diss you
