(Esoteric) 
 My blows landed, those they froze stranded 
 Most by most branded, for life I'm precise 
 These so-called perfectionists must have no standards 
 Thinkin' they're the don when they shit comes on 
 They got it all wrong, tryna step into E's world 
 They fakin jacks like the bootleg cheese curls 
 Please girls - stop eating up rice cakes 
 Have a nice steak for Christ sakes 
 My mic takes many lives, like 20 knives to the uterus 
 A pugilist, whipin out cities like Mt. Vesuvius 
 You jealous jerks - I'll rip you out your Perry Ellis shirts 
 Write a rap on the map and show you Hell on Earth 
 I pop fly shit, you catch it like Dennis Burkes 
 They only way you'd be well at work is sellin Certz 
 (Yo Esoteric, when you bringin' the pain son?) 
 It's probably gettin' done as we speak like Jenna Jame-son 
 (Chorus: samples cut up) 
 "Captivate 'em before the raps deactivate 'em" 
 "I smile with a sinister grin and finish him" 
 "Crews I run through it, drama I'm in to it" 
 "Right stupid" <-- Raekwon 
 "What! Bring it I'll blow ya whole spot" <-- Punisher 
 (Celph Titled) 
 Yo, fuck what you heard these are words from now Testament 
 Bring ya squadron and face the Demigodz regiment 
 I breathe fire, guns are a part of me 
 Fuck preservin hip-hop artistry, I'll propel bullets through ya arteries! 
 Come through my hood and get smacked with the four 
 You look like a FAGGOT! Just like Eve looks like a crack-whore 
 Straight up and down deadly, that's how my clique spit 
 I'm dope, you're just a barbituate kickin bitch shit 
 I choke MC's till they turn green, I'm a sick man 
 If a Martian fucks with me I'll choke him till he turns tan 
 Now that's some stupid shit and niggaz ain't havin' that 
 Celph Titled's known to rip apart all you average cats 
 You might find me on a raft floatin from Cuba 
 With heavy ammunition, assault rifles and bazookas 
 And while your out claimin sets doin' drive-bys 
 I'm in a stealth bomber, breakin sound, doin' fly-bys 
 (Chorus: samples cut up) 
 (Open Mic) 
 I move the crowd like a riot squad or national guard 
 And pull cards like blackjack dealers at the Mirage 
 Reflect life like light off the predator's camoflauge 
 Competitors find it hard to battle against the odds 
 They gaze into the oracle to see the euphorical rays 
 That it displays for every metaphorical phrase 
 Audio visuals like a spiritual ritual 
 Individuals need to uprise against the citadel 
 Stray from the typical, originality's at a minimal 
 My soundwaves blaze with every syllable 
 I'll give a lesson on emceein as a professional 
 To teach you herbs steppin' that my words are a weapon 
 You got gassed, like you put the pedal to the floor 
 I'll put the metal in your jaw so you know that I'm raw 
 I do damage and represent the whole damn planet 
 So no matter where I'm at I got the homefield advantage 
 (Chorus: samples cut up) 
 (Apathy) 
 I make it hot like Heather Hunter's pussy in the summer 
 Then I fuck her hard enough to make Chloe Jones shudder 
 [Fuck buyin Prada!] I'll make her call me the Don Da-Da 
 I'm a computer with a super medulla oblongata 
 [You don't know Ap!] Save ya homo rap 
 [We rock Polo] You cop Chaps at TJMaxx 
 Think that you could battle me and win? Next plan 
 There's a better chance of Eminem joinin X-Clan 
 'Cause we [crush] mother [fuckers] when we [spit it] we're the [illest] crew 
 [Demi] Godz [bring it] with the [deadly] style [killin] you 
 And y'all ain't basement, y'all are locked in the cellar 
 Ain't sayin' shit like a Helen Keller acapella 
 And we originated "Root Beers" for ya frigid air 
 (So emcees had to get day-jobs with Medicare) 
 You cats run around sweatin Demigodz CD 
 Motherfucker calm down, this is only the EP...
