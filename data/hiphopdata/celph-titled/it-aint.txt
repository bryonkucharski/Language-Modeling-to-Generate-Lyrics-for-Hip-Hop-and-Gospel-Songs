Yo you ready for real shit? Pull your guns off the shelf 
 Bitches fuck rubbing your titties and finger yourself 
 The uncanny Don Juan DeMarco Ricky Ricardo 
 Strapped with extra arsenals, you know the motto 
 I put the metal right in front of your face 
 And let that motherfucker loose until the shit disintegrates 
 Ain't never seen a nigga who can rhyme like me 
 Grip the nine like me and split your spine like me 
 Certified expertise with these rhyming degrees 
 I got a violent disease that make me eager to squeeze 
 My applause is a gun clap (whatt?) shouldn't have done that 
 Celph Titled hold back? Nah son fuck that 
 I'm the top of New York the God spectacle 
 Highly respectable, your shit is unacceptable 
 Go back to the lab and try to prevail 
 You couldn't be on point if you slept on nails 
 And that's my word duke you can take it for granted 
 I own the whole universe and that includes this planet 
 Go against me you might as well be battling God 
 You get treated like Christ up in a Pagan synagogue 
 Yo it ain't a crime if you don't get caught (say what?) 
 It ain't a rhyme if you don't use thought (and uh) 
 It ain't my joint if this shit is not hot (hey yo) 
 It ain't your block if you catch a speed knock (a'ight) 
 It ain't your business if you not in command (true that) 
 It ain't your bitch if she with another man (okay) 
 It ain't real if you can't find the truth (no doubt) 
 It ain't it ain't a thing I can't do 
 Who the fuck said Celph Titled couldn't even rhyme right? 
 My repertoire shine bright, show you with a nine light 
 Let the bullets rip you up, choke a nigga spitting up 
 You never getting up, all your vitals organs splitted up 
 I'm on some gun shit, crazy dumb shit 
 Got sixteen round clips for all them fuckers that you run with 
 A lot of cats think I'm soft in this game 
 I got the force and the fame, I put the boss in my name 
 You'll get lost in the flames trying to fuck with my clique 
 I put a gun in your lip, I just got tons of this shit 
 Even the Devil would be cringing at the shit I'm endorsing 
 Disrespect me and get your life expectancy shortened 
 Give a fuck about advance rapping trying to be innovative 
 I'd rather rhyme about the different guns that I can spray you with 
 I'm narrow-minded and I got a cannon with a kick behind it 
 And when it let's loose it'll leave you open-minded 
 Probably take a microscope to count your loot 
 I stack chips more than Intel could possibly compute 
 Weighed myself on a triple-beam 'cause I'm so dope 
 Pick up your wifie on the low and stick my dick down her throat 
 Yo it ain't a crime if you don't get caught (say what?) 
 It ain't a rhyme if you don't use thought (and uh) 
 It ain't my joint if this shit is not hot (hey yo) 
 It ain't your block if you catch a speed knock (a'ight) 
 It ain't your business if you not in command (true that) 
 It ain't your bitch if she with another man (okay) 
 It ain't real if you can't find the truth (no doubt) 
 It ain't it ain't a thing I can't do 
 Yo my crew is full of I'll cats, real kids who peel caps 
 Put a machete to your nuts, nigga you feel that? 
 I'm raw to the core and stay Vietnam-like 
 I'll be fifty and fucking bitches on Prom Night 
 Underground cat you probably heard me on some twelve inches 
 Broadcasting live via satellite from Hell's trenches 
 Nice on the tracks and I'm nice with the rhymes 
 You know the Celph Titled legacy be top of the line 
 In my promo there's more play than porno flicks in slo-mo 
 Superstar status whether collabo or solo 
 I do an encore and just be spitting some more 
 I'm the type of cat to fuck a bitch and call her a whore 
 I'm on some real trife shit, you know you heard me on the Smackdown 
 Knocking niggas out, they never made it to the last round 
 My man [?] rock well released the Glock shells 
 Pull out the heat and put it in your mouth like [?] 
 I only fuck up when your bitch is on top of me 
 I hold monopolies and kill rappers for hobbies 
 Yo I ain't a thug but I could kill one 
 And I can rhyme until the dusk or dawn or wait until the reel's done 
 Yo it ain't a crime if you don't get caught (say what?) 
 It ain't a rhyme if you don't use thought (and uh) 
 It ain't my joint if this shit is not hot (hey yo)
