(Verse 1: Funkghost) 
 Yo, fabulous movers, we do you like extravagant rulers 
 With savage maneuvers, run through you 
 Even crashing computers, we get like Brian De Palma 
 When applying the drama, we tie it up on ya 
 Like messing with a flying parana 
 We got a plan to vanish in the transatlantic 
 When jams are planted while overseas my fans go frantic 
 Put in plain we in the chain like we Jane Seymore 
 But all you see is poetry and blood stained keyboards 
 See lord that's why we keep upping trouble knee deep 
 Got receipts from when we bubbled at the double tree suite 
 Foreign exchange its strange how we torn your frame 
 So in the fame while others sound boring and lame 
 The flavor we on, similar to Lela Rochon 
 While haters are bomb, take it to a state of beyond 
 Don Juan won ton, Egyptian musk a clips a bust designed 
 And then dipped in plush, you know what 
 In T-I we try to be hi 
 And it lasts to the party don't stop 
 T-I we fly so see why 
 Make your body rock 
 The dope flip, so sick, it don't quit 
 Got dough, just in case you don't know 
 The whole clique, so thick, so don't slip 
 Rock flows international 
 (Verse 2: I-Man) 
 Caught crashing, bashing, the lyrical point guard be smashing 
 The cement, international coming soon, peep the fashion 
 It's goons in masks and ass verbal good ass crashing 
 Sound splashing, dancing on your grave monster mashing 
 Tango with cashing, yo call me manimal, half man 
 All the rest is primal animal, spiritual cannibal 
 Dirty tricks, I got a handful, I'm dropping anvils 
 On the wack cats that want to act like fucking damsels 
 In distress, lyrical bench press on my chest 
 Led slugs from a chrome snub, it's hard to digest 
 I guess wedlock, is deadlock, transform into grim rock 
 Throw that ass in a headlock pile drive you down into bedrock 
 Life's a guy, why not block is Salem's lot, no need for storyline 
 Because my mind is the plot, I got it locked down from glock town 
 To the shark clowns my rocks scrounge homie in any fly cop sounds 
 Surround my four pound pop from the top of mound 
 The god thunderous of war, call me Mr. Brown 
 In T-I we try to be hi 
 And it lasts to the party don't stop 
 T-I we fly so see why 
 Make your body rock 
 The dope flip, so sick, it don't quit 
 Got dough, just in case you don't know 
 The whole clique, so thick, so don't slip 
 Rock flows international 
 (Verse 3: Phobi One) 
 The world's a ghetto, typical thugs 
 Plus the drugs, plus I shouldn't settle 
 Less is never pits and the rugs plush 
 Jack of all trades, merchants of death 
 And habitats crack on all phase 
 The livest show, the one I'm rapping at 
 Through the grapevine, 
 Prime time define the great mind 
 All your fake rhymes 
 While mine shines on baselines, like a novelist 
 Best seller books and the rap sheets 
 Got all of this, fame the name, plus the fat beats 
 The T-town, fun in the sun 
 Subtropical, the beat down 
 Chrome to your dome by drug mafias 
 Loosen up, 20 ounce cups and kids boozing up 
 Gin and coke, getting rope while me and ghost producing cuts 
 Reanimate ball down and butter like Land O Lakes 
 Can't stand the taste of blood on the floor and cans of mace 
 I don't know why they try and battle P-H-O-B-I 
 They up the creek knee high, 'cause I rip the skee-i 
 (Verse 4: Celph Titled) 
 Yo, behold the spectrum, T-P-A anthem 
 From the don of the 8-1-3, Celph Titled, mystery 
 From which my calculations equal that of shadows 
 With no physical source, leaving inconclusive reports 
 Unorthodox repertoire, composed of the Chrome Depot 
 And the reservoir, dropping state metaphor 
 I used to sell tapes out the trunk right next to the gun rack 
 Where we keep the genie and the rugs at 
 Fry the bullets out the barrel, make you eat the shit 
 Sample you screaming for help and make a beat with it 
 Its simple science, that why my five star alliance holds 
 Format contraptions, that's Y2K compliant 
 Funkghost network put you up on something 
 Mega heat spray, lift you up with something 
 It's pirates of the Caribbean and I'm the Cuban 
 Knowledge for the future, historic pollution 
 In T-I we try to be hi 
 And it lasts to the party don't stop 
 T-I we fly so see why 
 Make your body rock 
 The dope flip, so sick, it don't quit 
 Got dough, just in case you don't know 
 The whole clique, so thick, so don't slip 
 Rock flows international
