Yes, yes y'all we going to keep it going strong 
 All night long (what) we don't even believe in dumbing out 
 (Never that) Yo we got a special guest in the place 
 By the name of Celph Titled (Yeah, yeah) 
 The Rubix Cuban (What up, what up) 
 What up Celph, man (Yeah) 
 Yo, how you doing? 
 (Celph Titled: Yo, ain't nothing man, just down and dirt about my scratch) 
 Oh word? 
 (Yo know what I mean) 
 So you going to kick something for the listeners or what? 
 (Oh, no doubt, yo) 
 Ok 
 (Verse 1: Celph Titled) 
 Now listen up, I ain't one for all of that tough guy chat 
 I come from East Waters Avenue, where niggas cock they gats at 
 Learned how to stack funds without pushing crack crumbs 
 Credit card fraud from pay phones getting cash sums 
 Back in '91, old school Tampa shit 
 Robbing lowriders for they tape decks, amps and kits 
 And we was never shook of cops 
 If we saw you getting shaped up 
 We'd turn the barbershop into a butcher shop 
 Nowadays we more chill but get more ill 
 Keep a burner for protection like I got a force field 
 No more Juice Crew, just faggots wearing Fubu 
 But that's cool, cause F.U. I wouldn't want to B.U 
 Niggas creep through with firearms that'll bang your back 
 A rotten ski mask that look more like a ninja mask 
 I rap like a trained assassin marine, piece the time machine 
 Write in night vision now my rhymes are green 
 I represent Demigodz and Army of the Pharoses 
 Collecting old guns, spending bread on ran toast 
 But if I'm getting on a track and you ain't as nice as me 
 I up the fee, spit a verse and charge you for the price of three 
 Yeah and that's a rap 
 A rap for all you string bean mother fuckers 
 Oh my bad, my bad, can we curse 
 (Yeah, don't sweat it Celph) 
 Oh, all right, my bad 
 That's a rap for you string bean mothers day advocates 
 You know what I mean, show some love to your mom 
 I know I did
