Verse One: 
 All you fuckin' DJs take heed to this installment 
 Or get your face augmented 
 Celph Titled spit raw sentences 
 Scully freak the instruments and all that 
 Weak niggas fall flat without they slip mat 
 Bangin' on wax 
 Got your neck hangin' from racks 
 Up in your studio with flamethrowers erasin' your DATs 
 It's serious 
 You ain't never in the DJ booth 
 You're spinnin' parties at gay clubs in your birthday suit 
 When my microphone is on, my tracks get felt 
 "While the techniques spin, the wax is on the felt" - Ultramagnetic MC's 'Ego Trippin' 
 And we outstanding/out standing like Buckingham Palace guards 
 And if you weaponless I still leave you unarmed 
 Literally 
 Beat juggle your frame, leave your chest cracked 
 Stab you with a Stanton, smack you with the Vestax 
 "I can't wait to break and eliminate" - Eric B. & Rakim 'Follow The Leader' 
 Any DJ without this record in their crate 
 Even the most simplest scratch you can't do nigga 
 Karaoke night's the only time you perform a jigga/Jigga 
 Your life is worth less than the trash it's been tossed in 
 Nobody carry your crates, now they carry your coffin 
 "It's Celph Titled motherfuckers" 
 "My tracks get felt" 
 "DJ Skully" "Bangin' on wax" 
 "Stab you with the ?, smack you with the best acts" 
 "It's Celph Titled motherfuckers" 
 "We demolish and kill" 
 "DJ Skully" 
 "Knock you out in the first round" 
 Ayo Skully

 You gonna rip these fake DJ's? 
 (No question Celph) 
 Check the video for replays 
 We sellin your defeat 
 Makin' money off of haters 
 That's how my man flip the fader with the techniques 
 Knock you out in the first round 
 You hear the champion sounds? 
 You can crab scratch but it's just an itch on your crotch 
 See me in the club with the finest bitch in the spot 
 I should have my own mixer but I'm not a disc jockey 
 Be the first MC to have DMC sponsor me 
 Kidnap your kids from your vintage place 
 Duct or electrical we use all different types of mix tape 
 So get it straight or get ate up from your own gut 
 "He sound wack... wait up hold up" 
 And every piece of music I did is on vinyl from the rock 'n' roll hall of hell 
 It's Celph Titled motherfuckers 
 You think your style is tougher than leather 
 You should polish your skills, we demolish and kill 
 Crap DJ's and you faggot rappers get it too 
 Skully cut the wax and bring the motherfuckin chorus through 
 "It's like that" "Like this" 
 "Motherfucker's tryin' to diss" 
 "You must be outta your fuckin' mind" 
 "I came back for those who still too intact" 
 "DJ Skully bout to fuck shit up" 
 "Celph Titled number one" 
 "We callin' the shots" 
 "We don't give a fuck" 
 "Well hold up I'm not done yet" 
 "We don't rock a spot we tear the roof off the bitch" 
 Outro [Celph Titled speaking]: 
 You have just witnessed real motherfuckin turntable science 
 Sprinkled with a little bit of thug sauce 
 From Tampa Bay to New York to the UK 
 Celph Titled AKA Frosty The Snow Thug 
 And DJ Skully AKA Scratch Your motherfuckin' Eyeballs Out 
 It don't get no more Godzilla than that 
 B-b-b-b-b-b-b-ap 
 Catch a couple of those and call me in the morning motherfuckers 
 Remember it ain't where ya from it's where's your gat 
 Bitch-ass nigga's
