(Celph Titled) 
 Eso, what up son? you know how the fuck we do, motherfuckin Demigods 
 Motherfuckin Army of the Pharoahs 
 It's murder death kill playboy, ainno safety's on 
 These microphones, ainno motherfuckin silencers for this shit 
 'Cause when we hold 'em... 
 We let this shit go off right in they're fuckin' face (let 'em know) 
 (Celph Titled) 
 I'm always gettin' a suntan on my gun hand 'cause I keep the burner out 
 Ready to blaze scorchin lead at your fam 
 So when I give you a pound, it's really 4 
 'Cause a 45. defies gravity, liftin you off of the floor 
 Pick out your coffin decor maybe some marble and gold 
 And hope they write some nice words when they carvin your stone 
 "Here lies a noble man who got brave stuck out his chest bone" 
 Beef with Celph Titled now this grave is what he calls home 
 Get your gaul stone put in a jar in a lab 
 Even the coroner got sick and had to barf in a bag 
 Your boyfriend said you was a marvelous fag 
 And in drag thought you was God like the carpenters dad 
 You said I wasn't rippin shit properly? 
 The magnitude of my gangsta is a motherfuckin scientific anomaly 
 With a strange collection of weapons I got a good assortment 
 Come close and ima cut you with a mercedes hood ornament 
 Yo, you talkin' loud homeboy we never heard of you 
 Put your little record out, nobody never heard of you 
 Went to your city, and they said they never heard of you 
 So we usin' motherfuckin bars of death to murder you 
 (Esoteric) 
 It's murder death kill 
 (Celph Titled) 
 Or it's kill death murder 
 (Esoteric) 
 Celph push they wig back 
 (Celph Titled) 
 ES push it back further 
 (Esoteric) 
 You comin' out your face? 
 (Celph Titled) 
 We handle beef to the bone marrow 
 (Esoteric) 
 No matter if it's demi gods 
 (Celph Titled) 
 Or army of the pharoahs 
 (Esoteric) 
 We beheadin your heroes steady&ready for eddie guerro 
 Theoretically your chance of deadin me zero 
 Give up your petty dinero, you better be at your pedigree 
 We medically and poetically my machete is ready 
 Me men don't need to coast the homie shows keep the gat close 
 ? Shove it down your throat, make you bite the iron man like you jackals 
 Bars of death connected like money fresh off the press 
 An old carcass left in the fetal position no people listen 
 Record spinnin but the needle is skippin 
 I never needed permission in sayin' I don't believe in religion 
 I believe in peepin a lethal evil tradition 
 I believe in merkin enemies with precision feedin the fish ? G's in my vision 
 Your styles infintile seek out a pediatrician 
 It be another emcee missin' on the evenin edition 
 Yeah, DC, with the sinister track...
