(Verse 1: Celph Titled) 
 Yeah, you goddamn right it's Celph Titled 
 The granddaddy grenade, mother fucker 
 With my man 7L the devastator 
 This is how we do this shit 
 Yo, my most prized possession is my knife collection 
 All types of different slices selections, the nicest 
 Weapons from the Get Right Reverend 
 Wiling out on niggas with outlandish rage 
 Plus I'm known to tote the iron like a Spanish maid 
 That's going to body you, really like straighten you out 
 Don't think I won't put the barrel straight in your mouth 
 How many times can I write about the same old shit 
 I guess I won't find out until y'all stop buying it 
 But until then it's guns, bitches, punch lines and human accords 
 There's kids across the world to argue over computers 
 Who's the best? Celph Titled 'cause he writes heaters 
 Caught so many bodies he should be the MVP wide receiver 
 I seen your chick where the groupies be 
 And when she's in my bed sounding off key like Looney-D 
 You out looking for the bitch, all nervous and shit 
 I took her to the A-Train and wrote this verse for 7L's mix 
 It's dangerous to play the role of a gangster 
 When you dealing with a gangster who employs many gangsters 
 Suffered and lifted on my back to make a queens soldier 
 Southside will flatten you like steam rollers 
 (Verse 2: Big Scoob) 
 Unh hunh, Big Scoob baby 
 AKA Johnny mother fucking Famous 
 Brooklyn, all day, you heard, trend setters 
 I fuck hos, dimes, bitches in they prime 
 Hood rat chickens who ain't got one dime 
 Don't give a fuck if you swole 
 I fill you with holes 
 Niggas will think you're Kwame 
 From the dots in your clothes 
 With a chain in your rhyme 
 Wrist that don't shine 
 Niggas want to be jigga but ain't got one dime 
 Everybody hot, everybody pop glock 
 Man you only seen a gun cause your pops a cop 
 I kick real shit, Brownsville on the hill shit 
 Big Scoob, Trend Setters, something you can feel shit 
 I Spray your block like graffiti, what 
 And wait for 5-0 to get an autographed CD 
 None of y'all niggas spit lines like these 
 I'll have your bitch yelling please Hercules, Hercules 
 Its war, it's like you a dead man walking 
 Trend Setters tired of you bitch niggas talking 
 (Verse 3: Terra) 
 Unnh, Terra, new shit, ha ha 
 Ay yo, there come a time 
 When everything must change 
 When y'all gotta stop selling the fuck out 
 That time is right now 
 You better ask about me, I'm the thug bitch 
 Whip out a shank and a dick in your back 
 Shit on your track, I get it down now 
 They be calling me fire, the rapper die bitch 
 The assassin for hire 
 Took everything I was taught to see what I can do 
 Fuck you hating ass bitches, you heard, you niggas too 
 The ain't your local radio station, come on dog 
 This ain't a broadcast live from the parking lot in the mall 
 These circles in the streets will get you the fuck hurt 
 And the last thing you want to do is spit your hottest shit first 
 How you want it dog? In your ass or your mouth 
 And you ain't got that much time because my shit is about to come out 
 And I will fuck, bite your fucking head off too 
 Out with a 4, 5 and 6 like kiss, a range too 
 If you truly a queen, then I'm talking to you 
 I'm the heir to the thrown and I'm coming the fuck through 
 It's my turn Terra
