(Chorus: Dutchmassive) 
 Don't ever push yourself against' the wall 
 Cause everybody at a time knows it gets raw 
 And if you step, we're going to shatter your jaw 
 ('Cause if your fucking with one kid, yo, you're fucking with 'em all) 
 (Verse 1: Celph Titled) 
 (Yo, who the fuck are you?) 
 Don Juan steeze be razor splitting you 
 Rubix Cuban unsolvable, the high tech arsenals 
 Shiny metal things spit something horrible 
 Vocal arrangements inaudible 
 Pistol whip you 
 Mandatory, not option, what you stupid? 
 My clique consists of dirty dogs, and Cuban mafia children 
 Plastic explosive play dough the money is mine if I say so 
 Ain't no thing in this universe that could ever be my match 
 Celph Titled without fly raps is like Slick Rick without an eye patch 
 Now how you like that? 
 Yup, my recipes dope I'm used to the game like Jeopardy under the oath 
 And lethal like white boys in trench coats 
 Straight up and down I'm serving niggas with 16 bar sentences 
 My spoken word is contagious and cancerous 
 I cancel kids like answering messages left by solicitation receptionists 
 Like my man Dutchmassive, we aggressively repping shit 
 (Ain't no question kid) 
 Lurking in the everglades 
 While you at home watching cartoons 
 I'll be sitting on the dock of the bay, with a harpoon 
 (Chorus: Dutchmassive) 
 Don't ever push yourself against' the wall 
 Cause everybody at a time knows it gets raw 
 And if you step, we're going to shatter your jaw 
 ('Cause if your fucking with one kid, yo, you're fucking with 'em all) 
 Don't ever push yourself against' the wall 
 Cause everybody at a time knows it gets raw 
 And if you step, we're going to shatter your jaw 
 ('Cause if your fucking with one kid, yo, you're fucking with 'em all) 
 (Verse 2: Walkman) 
 And pissed off the wrong one 
 Hand break my pencil piece when I write this 
 A head storm shatter skulls 
 Speaking of blood sport, splatter over all pearly white 
 Fresh contest blazing adrenaline behaving rude and absurd 
 While the out of states criticize from the outside viewing 
 In observing and stressing us, the tropics 
 Fuck all you corn hole fuckers with no logic 
 Brining the heat, scorching your bare feet 
 Sprinting butt naked, long distance 
 Decking moving objects, direct shots but beaming optics 
 And that's the instincts of a natural at time 
 If you ain't heard right, I split bricks, strictly certified blaze shit 
 Light speed I'm sonically inclined with godly insight 
 Niggas get blow to bits like megabytes 
 Can't fuck with this, all right 
 Storm dash trooper, the cybernetic intelligence 
 The 5th element regiment, crush your residence into sediments 
 Encrypted flows with the centrifugal dialect 
 The Puerto Rican cybernetic one 
 Authentic while you synthetic son 
 I hold down the galaxy with unanimous connections 
 Quantum physics expert ripping holes right through your guess shirt 
 The seven squadron dynasty get down and dirty violently 
 Walkmen and freestyles with the emcee seeking missles 
 Atomically stay blazing accurately bout to black out of this 
 Is Tampa's side of things and that's what 8-1-3's about 
 (Chorus: Dutchmassive) 
 Don't ever push yourself against' the wall 
 Cause everybody at a time knows it gets raw 
 And if you step, we're going to shatter your jaw 
 ('Cause if your fucking with one kid, yo, you're fucking with 'em all) 
 Don't ever push yourself against' the wall 
 Cause everybody at a time knows it gets raw 
 And if you step, we're going to shatter your jaw 
 ('Cause if your fucking with one kid, yo, you're fucking with 'em all) 
 (Verse 3: Dutchmassive) 
 Yo, I sense anger, how you going to diss a total stranger 
 Talk about my records, I'm a have to rearrange you 
 Feel this laser, you're not who you pretend to be 
 Knock off your identity and aim for longevity 
 Fuck your concepts, I can do without your comments 
 The liveliest player on a catcher burning comet 
 You make me vomit, sick of all your trends 
 If I break all keyboards before tracks the wackness ends 
 Constantly stay blazing, F-L-A is dumb hot 
 No glocks baby boy, I'll smash your jaw with a cinder block 
 Hard knock not, I'm just a little anti-social 
 We word wide, while y'all still think we local 
 My name is Dutchmassive, remember that shit 
 I'm killing kids, girls that diss me, get the di-dick 
 Only got a few close friends and that's way too much 
 Cause soon they all jock us when we blow the fuck up
