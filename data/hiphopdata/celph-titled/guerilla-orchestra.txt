(Intro: Tino Vega) 
 Yeah, I like this one, yeah 
 Yo, Celph, Apathy and Tino Vega, yo 
 Unnh hunh (Set it on him like that) 
 Tampa Florida, baby yeah 
 (Verse 1: Tino Vega) 
 Ay, yo, pass me a hat about these black ashes 
 Be out as fast as I can your man got bodied 
 In the back of a stolen Ac, 
 By black trash baggers, what's going on 
 Nowadays we got gay rappers 
 Singing our songs and hearing me wrong 
 Till they repping it strong baby, all day long 
 Cliques rapping about making moves 
 Playing it calm climbing up Jacobs ladder 
 See a mill and we on 
 What hold down fort, you thought wrong 
 Blood sport, loud in the place, I'm loud in your face 
 Sirens mad loud when they chase 
 Sick of them jakes, I want to put sticks in they steaks, yo 
 Walkman through sales, you caught attacking them stakes 
 Keep dropping the hot shit for the payers to hate, you know 
 So fell me, if not, I don't care, throw your girls panties in the air 
 That's how we on the keep, flaunting them drawers 
 We're going to pawn them 
 Your man keep talking that spit, I'm going to dog him 
 Got dreams of marrying a Latin chick, a rapper bitch from Harlem 
 You can ask the surfer dudes and hippies if I'm awesome 
 Yo, back up off him this niggas too hot, run in your spot 
 Leaving with everything you got 
 Don't believe me best not, put the stress on the dreadlocks 
 Niggas get props, lick 10 shots for hip hop 
 What, what? Bring it on, you don't want it, what 
 (Verse 2: Celph Titled) 
 Yo, unh, yo 
 I don't get no iller than Celph Titled 
 For God sakes 
 We move in silence except for the sound 
 The glock makes 
 Where I'm from, we never name names 
 We just be pointing infrared beams 
 And watch the barrel start to spit flames 
 Insane from birth, flip game with words 
 Inflict pain and it hurts 
 In actuality, I'm know astronomically 
 Leave a mother fucker split in half 
 I heard you talking this and that 
 We taking no shorts like church dress codes 
 I need a bitch that'll stash my guns inside of casseroles 
 Test my gangster and the outcome is straight A's 
 Bullet holes from AKs, wounds bleeding for eight days 
 It's kind of fucked up how we some raw niggas 
 That'll spit some hardcore shit over beats like this 
 I must be out my fucking mind without a doubt 
 My fam keep it gorilla with banana clips 
 We let the monkey out nigga 
 (Verse 3: Apathy) 
 Yeah, unh unh unh, what 
 Yeah, me and your girl will take a walk through the park 
 Late night in the dark, I'll caress the back of her neck 
 Then rip out her heart, sharp mentality 
 Apathy grips gats, spits raps bitch slaps chicks back 
 I'm funky chewing tic tacs cause after I eat flesh 
 My breath smells like death 
 After I fuck chicks, their breath smells like sweat 
 I'll lock it down, cock the pound 
 Be careful who you talk around 
 Cops found another mic to draw the white chalk around 
 And while you small cats are trying to bust off gats 
 I got to wreck it over records, so I dust off wax 
 Ap, Celph and Tino can slam it like we're Tino Santana 
 From Tampa Bay to CT my gamma rays change my brain 
 Like Lou Ferrigno, I'll spit flows to rip shows and get dough 
 I'll stick hos who lick dick until it blows 
 I'll hit Foes the clip goes and gats, you'll never test Ap 
 So just put away your raps, you're wack
