(Intro: L Fudge) 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Unh, unh 
 L Fudge, Celph Titled 
 (Verse 1: L Fudge) 
 You lacks the minerals and vitamins 
 Respect due to that 
 The average hip hop consumer is now like, who that? 
 Songs now a days ain't staying stuck in your brain 
 They got to the point that all songs that suck sound the same 
 Speaking on behalf of a third of us in the game 
 Whenever dope comes up they ain't announcing our names 
 Not running up in clubs screaming 
 When my songs pumping they celeb status waning like Keenan 
 They big headed and gassed up, I'm staying on the cement 
 Don't want to hear that talk around me, I'm not playing 
 But my villains, y'all couldn't help know this bitch 
 Is rated over me then, y'all automatically 
 Get more frequent to my semen 
 Pay attention to how closely to how stupid y'all look 
 Like a producer dropping dime on a new Cubans hook 
 Shit back to the song, continuing to split lyrics in half 
 To the point in the bathroom you ask if its on 
 You'll be like, 'yeah it is' don't his rap be the bomb 
 Listen what's with dun and our pens sing a long 
 Bring it on, whatever, that's how this shit supposed to be 
 I ain't new nice, I've been since Hawaiian Sophie, please 
 (Verse 2: Celph Titled) 
 You can't mislead a champion 
 Don Dada, Celph Pachino 
 Nice with the gun clap, get your front smacked 
 You not militant, so how can your rank hang 
 With a man that is quick enough to dodge 
 A bullet a point blank range 
 The 9 double M snub, real handle this 
 I don't puff weed, but I could still smoke Canibus 
 Upper echelon, at the Grammys, get my trophy on 
 I'm kind of childish, I'll choke you with a Pokemon 
 In fact, I like sex and violence so much 
 I have fantasies of busting off rounds when I fuck 
 Some say I'm a sick nigga, let the gun click nigga 
 Cuban spic nigga, why you all up on my dick, nigga? 
 I said it before, and I'm a say it again 
 I'd rather write with a knife and stab your ass with a pen 
 You couldn't release dope shit even if you at a kilo 
 Bitchs know my stee-lo and scream "Aye que Rico" 
 Celph Titled is lethal without enhancements 
 I'm like a tape deck that can't rewind, always advancing 
 I'll smack Swiss Beats over the head with his own Casio 
 And bring real hip hop back to my stage show 
 I don't know sign language so fuck a contract 
 That's what I speak, understand that 
 Wanna know what a real pussy feels like? 
 Why don't you stand in the corner and hug yourself real tight 
 Mother fucker 
 (Celph Titled) Yo, this is for my niggas smoking chronic in blunts 
 (L-Fudge) For my my British niggas smoking spliffs along with silk, hunh? 
 (Celph Titled) For my European niggas smoking ounces of skunk 
 (L-Fudge) To my Dominican's making thousands off of just one 
 (Celph Titled) We can make songs for you, shit, why the fuck not 
 (L-Fudge) I take the first hit, hide it from cops, cops see, don't they paid to be dope, I'm addicted to bitches that give me brains to elope, but I'm tied up like Rudolph on a sleigh to a rope and cut up short like a movie to a dope 
 (Celph Titled) I'm an ungrateful asshole who's always quick to wet cops, have my t-shirts made in a third world sweat shop 
 (L-Fudge) You should have some sympathy 
 (Celph Titled) Well how could I have that? When I was 12, I was homeless and living with the rats 
 (L-Fudge) It's L-Fudge and Celph Titled we be NY's best, coming four times magnum, straight to your chest, what
