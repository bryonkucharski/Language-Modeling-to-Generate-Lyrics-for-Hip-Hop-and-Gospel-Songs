Celph Titled: 
 Haunted by the opticals, exhibiting the man within myself 
 Parallel vision with no mirror in my possession 
 Seek help in this digression, consciously aware 
 A piece of human kind specifically designed for serving Jehovah 
 The hope for peace is over 
 The future correlates to actions executing themselves 
 Presently to the third degree 
 To the maximum, the year 1 comma 9-9-8 
 Nuclear buttons are controlling my fate 
 Hallucinate myself behind bars, there's nothing I can do 
 Watch my brother self-destruct, affected with eternal flu 
 Technology advances advanced into potential danger 
 Government officials soon seek employment at the 18th hanger 
 Question the theory that one person makes a change 
 Stand up for your beliefs or all perceptions stay the same 
 From now until then, most people play the back seat 
 In this atmospherical taxi without paying fee 
 The problems persistent, misguided by the plush existence 
 Look at my hands, I realize just exactly who I am 
 Cause it was always here, when will it ever go away 
 The answer to that question comes with judgment day 
 Vex: 
 My voice travels miles from the middle east of Florida 
 Toward the vital information through your corridor 
 The New World Order the ill plot to lock blocks 
 Watch the poor on they monitors resort to selling rocks 
 Society's the pyramid on the back of the dollar 
 Minorities the bottom rung, the middle rung is the scholars 
 Moving up in the degrees in masonic fraternities 
 Like the order Louis representing the beast 
 Infantries infiltrating they every wicked move 
 With recognizant tactics that be locking the groove 
 A record, so you can check it, respect it and know the truth 
 Babylon's a war, I fight this war with proof 
 For black youth who ain't free but just emancipated 
 Like fifty percent of brothers in DC incarcerated 
 Still, we can be faded, that's what America's so jaded 
 Change the whole frame of the game and how they played it 
 But we get assassinated by press like OJ 
 But when Clinton page whores and wage wars, it's ok 
 I break these lines of defense like sports and take no shorts 
 When I'm out in the streets or approaching the bench in circuit courts 
 My battles are fought, the narrow path is sought 
 Yo, my soldiers bring the wrath of God and can't be bought 
 If you brought the KKK and the pope, you couldn't enslave the voice 
 That collapsed the matron to an enclave 
 I dropped a jewel and save a pearl from the swine 
 Corrupt they minds, keeping this jam shining in the nines 
 Powerless cause power refines, you gained spine catch a house arrest anklet 
 Tracked by GPS, information and location beamed to satellites 
 You thought you could dead it yo, but you can't battle right, take my advice 
 Or wise up on your mission, hot metal can't change the ghetto's critical condition 
 If our lives were a novel, this could be the last edition 
 Realize what you do and start to make the right decision 
 If you're seeking trouble, time to change your position 
 Our generation can't survive in critical conditions 
 Dutchmassive: 
 The organic cyborg deport from a tape deck 
 Dastardly fall off glass mirror with no concept 
 Ironic, I was created from Chernobyl's project 
 Outcast into the shadows, a city without logic 
 Peeking out sewer drains, I learned from society 
 So half humanoids is mutant plus they rioting 
 Vital information journalists remain silent 
 Saturday morning cartoons consist of sins and acts of violence 
 Now I'm violent, bringing up violent attack mode 
 I have cloned human vortex to avoid a barcode 
 Conditions for the future are decided through the present 
 Indefinite, through genetics, I was raised to be intrepid 
 Forget utopia, junk planet is my reality 
 I used to dream about life as a peaceful art gallery 
 Top secret ways of living, citizens controlled by hard drive 
 Lives covered by government to androids with snake eyes 
 Majik Most: 
 I walk the earth in contemplation 
 While man fall victim to self-inflicted mutations 
 I'm saddened by the never ending cycle of wickedness and ignorance 
 The nation stays unconscious, I call upon the savior 
 Falling into God's arms is critical to explore your spiritual 
 Side if you collide with this final judgment day 
 Past the next millennium, material objects become like dust in the wind 
 See, you trapped in a fantasy, unaware your body is temporary 
 A housing for the soul control your destiny through righteous steps know yourself 
 The future now unfaded, never definite 
 It lies in the palms of this next generation but will it be infected with the same rotation 
 Of evil actions, society is full of sin and stagnant 
 I fight against the system and pass on the wisdom 
 You can't disrupt these sevens the mind stays divine forever placed among the heavens
