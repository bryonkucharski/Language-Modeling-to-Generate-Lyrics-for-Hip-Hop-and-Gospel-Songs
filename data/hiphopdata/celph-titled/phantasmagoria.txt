(Verse 1: Araknophobix) 
 You can now enter my invisible rhyme real world 
 How does it fell? Mortals tend to melt into the mix 
 Unconscious come with me, I'll lead you to the core 
 Trap doorway to nowhere, you woke up with no hair 
 Completely singed off traveling at light speed, don't go there 
 Prepare to feel the effects of the venom we inject through the neck 
 Way beyond what you'd expect, just wait a sec 
 Ah, there it is again euphoric oblivion 
 Cranial stimulation exits from eyeballs, this padded room has eye walls 
 Atom crushing fly balls, it's my fault 
 (Verse 2: Celph Titled) 
 Yo, the God body divine mathematically 
 Wave my staff at the faculty 
 I see visual hallucinations with acute accuracy 
 Lock down communication through the mouth like slave days 
 My rules canal from dungeons into synagogue limit cave ways 
 Do not block with your eyes will not deceive you and put you in visions 
 Expose identities that I can see through as a warning 
 The photo phantasm, certificate notary 
 Counting sheep while they jump over me 
 While hanging by my rosary 
 (Verse 3: Raj) 
 We all went to sleep inside of a vortex 
 Many childs unhurting, anticipating the effects 
 In a few minutes, we have lived a whole lifetime 
 With our minds but we like living, feeling divine 
 Magic chemistry unlike you will ever be 
 The same by deep blue for the insane 
 Antenna methamorphisze resonate 
 Psychoactive specimen electron metabolic state 
 Antenna methamorphisze resonate 
 Psychoactive specimen electron metabolic state 
 (Verse 4: Dutchmassive) 
 Chrome eight legged arachnid shoots its webbing 
 Live disable enemies reach for my weapon 
 Get the fuck back, beyond paranoid 
 My fist is now attached to an alien android 
 Cyborgs attack me, I could see a spaceship 
 I'm wasted to the point where I'm ripping off my face 
 Lying, my body is numb and wondering 
 Life on acid, alcohol and overdoes on toxaphene 
 (Verse 5: Maleko) 
 Optical distort, teleport and stop abortions 
 Fiery Phoenix, morbid phantoms sorceress 
 Levitating through colorful clouds 
 Rotating counterclockwise, contorted 
 Deep in the chorus, sordid endorphin 
 Chariots of fire scorching 
 Dunes they sent those flying swordfish horsemen 
 North winds in the sky orchestrating 
 Painting the devil evil grin in his eye 
 To deadly cold and hideous shapes 
 Reaching up through a watery grave 
 Super regular figures appear to dwindle 
 Forensics leave paralysis 
 Floating palaces motionless sculpts in flights reunions 
 Every time I dream at night it gets so confusing 
 Silent words explaining, raining ominous comets
