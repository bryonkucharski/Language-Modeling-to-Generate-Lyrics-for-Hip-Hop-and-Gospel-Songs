(Intro: The1shanti) 
 Yeah, that's right 
 You know what I mean 
 Bombay Safire, the India Bambaataa 
 Ain't no underground shit right here 
 Ay, yo, Electro, bring in the drums son 
 It's like niggas see your mug up on TV 
 And they think shits sweet, right 
 You know what I mean 
 Do a couple of major label tours 
 And shit ain't sweet 
 Ay, yo, Celph Titled 
 Talk to these mother fuckers 
 (Verse 1: Celph Titled) 
 Look down the barrel mother fucker 
 You can see what hell look like 
 I ain't never rock a halo 
 I grow horns from my head at midnight 
 My whole steeze consists of anger management release 
 Act like a baby and get dropped right on your head piece 
 This flow is deadly faggot, fuck, what you stupid 
 Oppose me and have you running 
 From an angry mob of Cubans 
 I'm a cross between Bram Stoker and La Cosa Nostra 
 We organized vampires with a chrome attire 
 This ain't no tough talk, it's words from a genius 
 You could me the meanest thug 
 I'll still have homicide cleaning your rug 
 Drinking the dick syrup, you bitches is intoxicated 
 I never use a rubber ma, my glocks are chrome plated 
 Up in the studio, my masters rest in an alter 
 We keep a holy dress code, my engineers wear priest collars 
 Duck from the fire spray, this is how we making hits 
 I love the taste of burnt flesh, it tastes like bacon bits 
 (Verse 2: The1shanti) 
 I know you seen us in those videos (Right) 
 And heard our voice on the radio (True that) 
 With all of the pretty faces, check the phrasing 
 We keep it moving, Cuban to Asian 
 In this game, it's either me or you star 
 I ain't come up like Harold and Kumar 
 More like that kid who's counting them blue cars 
 Fucks with mines, you'll be calling on Blue Cross 
 Aspiring, I take it one step higher than 
 I stay trail blazing, they bootleg firemen 
 Conspiring, thinking of me retiring 
 You in too deep, now you wrestling leviathan 
 Deny a man from getting paid right 
 You all perspiring because you a bunch of playwrights 
 Stay tight with family, don't need friends kid 
 When I said 90 percent nigga I meant it 
 Some man shit, this is my school, y'all suspended 
 Never missing a day of the hustle, perfect attendance 
 Liquor a blend with to make your head spin 
 With electro-four yo, that nigga president 
 (Outro: The1shanti) 
 I know you seen us in those videos (True) 
 And heard our voice on the radio (Right) 
 With all of the pretty faces, check the phrasing 
 We keep it moving, Cuban to Asian 
 It's like mother fuckers see your mug up on MTV 
 And shit and think shit's sweet all the sudden. 
 Y'all ain't grinding on the levels we've been grinding at 
 Mother fucking assholes 
 Trying to take away a little bit of shine 
 Because we've been grinding a decade and then some 
 Put in your time and then talk the shit 
 Do your homework 
 Before you talk to the mother fucking professors 
 Celph mother fucking Titled 
 Mother fucking 1shanti 
 Electro mother fucking four 
 Do the research
