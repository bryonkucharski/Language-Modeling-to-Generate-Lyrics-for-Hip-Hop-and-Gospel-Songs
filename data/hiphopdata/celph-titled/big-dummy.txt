(Intro: Celph Titled) 
 Yo, you mother fuckers know the deal 
 This is Celph Titled, the mother fucking mother fucker 
 (Yo and this is Mareko, J kicking, signmo step brother) 
 Y'all some stupid bitches, you know that 
 (Stupid, stupid, stupid) 
 Or better yet, y'all some big dummies 
 That's how we calling it 
 (Yup, yo) 
 (Verse 1: Mareko) 
 Yo, there's two hundred and sixty six members on my hit list 
 But no added preservatives and digest the biscuits 
 Welcome to my humble abode mic metaphysics 
 Look inside of my stove stove and see if the bread is missing 
 Mr. Mareko that big bull-a, I'm tired, just trying to get some sleep 
 Like Rick ruler, you want beef, you want the mad butcher 
 I want to see who win in a fight between George Speights and Ram Booker 
 I'm uncle bully on the mic, if these beats were wearing that lingerie, I would molest 
 Them at night, yo I stepped in a fight that I started on purpose 
 He should have known my beats were for a bunch warriors like John Kerwin 
 You are not certain, don't start speaking, last time I just put down my head 
 Like hide so no one could see me, oh how embarrassing 
 Man you guys are now stuck in the pits like Jennifer Anniston 
 (Chorus: Celph Titled) 
 You big dummy, damn your fun 
 Your breath smells bad and your girlfriends ugly 
 Plus your fat and you got no money 
 Nah nah nana nah nana nah 
 You big dummy, damn your fun 
 Your breath smells bad and your girlfriends ugly 
 Plus your fat and you got no money 
 Nah nah nana nah nana nah 
 (Verse 2: Celph Titled) 
 Yeah, yo, whoever want action could get they mug torn open 
 Shoot first and ask questions later, that's the slogan 
 Mother fuck a pacifist, we bring wars to peace treaties 
 Steal from the needy and take a piss on your beat CD 
 Never smile for the press, I guess I'm hard pressed 
 And don't like beef unless it's really charred flesh 
 Teach the kids to bust 'cause they fast learners 
 My clique is like stove tops, we all carry burners 
 When we use them, my family start eating your face up 
 Leave you looking like Angie Martinez without makeup 
 Blaze up, you can't believe the way I hustle stuff 
 95 degrees in July I'm selling earmuffs by the cases 
 I only dropped one single, count 'em 
 Niggas already making The Best of Celph Titled albums 
 Y'all getting out done, no need to hear the outcome 
 You looking for a death wish, guess what, you've just found one 
 (Chorus: Celph Titled) 
 You big dummy, damn your fun 
 Your breath smells bad and your girlfriends ugly 
 Plus your fat and you got no money 
 Nah nah nana nah nana nah 
 You big dummy, damn your fun 
 Your breath smells bad and your girlfriends ugly 
 Plus your fat and you got no money 
 Nah nah nana nah nana nah 
 (Verse 3: Mareko) 
 Mareko, two thousand and three 
 My stories bound the beef 
 Loaded in the bottle and it's yet to be found at the sea 
 You big dummies, I pull my pants down to the knees 
 So you clowns can see big things like P Money 
 I'm a bad boy, me and Puffy 
 Stay cruising down Beach Street in beach buggies 
 I greet the ugly face of death with a frown and open arms 
 While we're both drunk in the back seat of a stolen car 
 You can catch me at the open bar 
 And that's for real, with no strings attached like an old guitar 
 I'm convinced, you can do a set for free and you'll still see 
 More spaces Donna Heckler's teeth 
 Ba ba boom boom ba ba boom boom 
 My uncle only eats luckewild with ga rule 
 Ba ba boom boom ba ba boom boom 
 My uncle only eats luckewild with ga rule 
 (Chorus: Celph Titled) 
 You big dummy, damn your fun 
 Your breath smells bad and your girlfriends ugly 
 Plus your fat and you got no money 
 Nah nah nana nah nana nah 
 You big dummy, damn your fun 
 Your breath smells bad and your girlfriends ugly 
 Plus your fat and you got no money 
 Nah nah nana nah nana nah
