[Intro][Man]: 
 What's gonna have to happen to change things? 
 [Woman]: 
 Huh. A hole lot gonna have to happen to change things. 
 A lot of motherfuckin' heads gonna start to pop off. 
 [Scratch Chorus]: 
 "Swingin', drama that I'm bringin' 
 On your left jaw I be tingin' 
 Swingin', drama that I'm bringin' 
 On your left jaw I be tingin' 
 Swingin', drama that I'm bringin' 
 On your left jaw I be tingin' 
 There's no way you can win 
 I'm wipin' off silly grins 
 When I come to kick your face in" - Big Shug 'Crush' 
 [Verse One]: 
 This ain't Rock Of Love but I'll rock a thug 
 Make you wear a rag and a wig like Brett Michaels does 
 The tec rifle is bug (yeah) 
 Sometimes it jams but most of the time it spits projectiles at your mug 
 I'm from a city known for rollin' cigars 
 Hoppin' fences in historic districts, evadin' patrol cars 
 And so far I go hard 
 I can spit four bars that's whip you across the face like chrome reinforced crowbars 
 In '96 I rocked with nine 6's 
 That's triple six, three times so imagine the evil in that (wow) 
 Dressed like Count Dracula beatin' you feeble people with bats 
 I like Britney Spears fat (yeah) 
 I'm puttin' poisonous gas in your motherfuckin' beer can hat 
 Your body found live on National Geographic where the Meerkats at 
 The white Latin with them weird ass raps 
 You better pay me right now cause 
 "I'm tryin' to make cream and that's that" - Mobb Deep 'Hell On Earth' 
 [Scratch Chorus]: 
 "Swingin', drama that I'm bringin' 
 On your left jaw I be tingin' 
 Swingin', drama that I'm bringin' 
 On your left jaw I be tingin' 
 Swingin', drama that I'm bringin' 
 On your left jaw I be tingin' 
 There's no way you can win 
 I'm wipin' off silly grins 
 When I come to kick your face in" - Big Shug 'Crush' 
 [Verse Two]: 
 Held this position in your bathroom, found you dead 
 (How'd you die?) 
 I put cyanide in your bathroom shower head 
 Critics who get the nerve; 
 They better hide they bitch and hoe 
 'Cause I'll put a bullet in your bird if you pigeonhole 
 In case you didn't know 
 I've got the illest flow 
 My style's double D all natural, yours is silicone 
 The punchline master 
 Never get lazy with my writing 'cause I am gettin' paid when I'm rhyming 
 You get slayed when you're rhyming 
 At a battle for free 
 If I'm moving my Adam's Apple it costs a fee (ya heard) 
 So pull your cannons and try these boys 
 And I'm sending lead back like it's some Chinese toys 
 Business mogul on my mobile phone 
 With an overgrown vocal tone known to leave you blown out of your mobile home (whoa) 
 And on your left jaw I'm tingin' 
 Drama that I'm bringin' 
 Don't work for the church but I be bell ringin' 
 [Scratch Chorus]: 
 "Swingin', drama that I'm bringin' 
 On your left jaw I be tingin' 
 Swingin', drama that I'm bringin' 
 On your left jaw I be tingin' 
 Swingin', drama that I'm bringin' 
 On your left jaw I be tingin' 
 There's no way you can win 
 I'm wipin' off silly grins 
 When I come to kick your face in" - Big Shug 'Crush' 
 [Verse Three]: 
 (You can call me Steven Tyler) 
 I'm one of the best arrow smiths/Aerosmiths 
 Expert with archery and all types of weapon shit 
 In my rap category, I stand alone 
 You stand alone without a date watchin' Home Alone 
 I put the Maaulay Culkin 
 Facial expression on the face of a bitch testin' 
 Bitch you see this Smith and Wesson? (see it?) 
 Remember Smif-N-Wessun? Now they the Cocoa Brovaz 
 Remember Celph Titled? Now he's a loco fucker 
 I'm dope because I chose a rubber when I fucked hip hop 
 And now that bitch can't burn me, so I rip shop 
 Better adapt to my philosophy soon 
 Or you gonna be that skeleton in that Biology room 
 I dare a beat maker to take it to war (with me) 
 Turn you to a ghost producer like a Dr. Dre (employee) 
 For sure you get fucked and felt 
 If you went gay bashin', you'd have to punch yourself 
 [Scratch Chorus]: 
 "Swingin', drama that I'm bringin' 
 On your left jaw I be tingin'" - Big Shug 'Crush'
