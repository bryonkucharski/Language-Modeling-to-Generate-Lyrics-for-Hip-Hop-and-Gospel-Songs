(Verse 1: Dutchmassive) 
 Yo there's a distance here 
 Yo there's a distance there 
 Here a diss, there a diss, everybody's dissin' me 
 Yo I'm out of options 
 The force of impact on local voices stays constant 
 Build a massive anger and now I'm lost in 
 Jealous of my homage, vocals and rough delivery 
 You're sick of me 
 Saddened by the fact we marked history 
 The first amongst professionals, emerging from Junk Planet 
 Planned in tropic states and then we start expanding 
 I'm the dopest lyricist 
 17 and always stressed 
 Cause my fucked-up outlook on life I stay vexed 
 I'm the best at what I do; I'm not a man you can defeat 
 Here's advice to all you cipher talk is cheap 
 I delete assholes with abundance of animosity 
 I'm still the dopest even though you fucked up my sound quality 
 An oddity, outcast, that's straight from the normal 
 Now who's the piece of shit? 
 Y'all cats is stupid! 
 (Verse 2: Celph Titled) 
 You know it's atomic when you can't stop the rain 
 Ravage bodies for segments and sediments 
 Ain't a damn thing changed 
 My persona precise conducts riveting performances 
 One hundred percentages 
 Vision of succeeding is fictitious like unicorn's with contact lenses 
 What?! 
 Most don't know what 
 Much of those freakin' are stisters staggering to sisters 
 Stops theirs sisters stuttering and study my rhymes 
 You can shake my hand but use the other to count your blessings 
 We be the three horsemen of this art form, odd numbers the essence 
 Flashing automatic weapons is blasphemous 
 You'd better hold something heavy 
 When me and the clique combine the counter-reaction's unbelievable 
 Thus inconceivable 
 Yo G-Clef hold me back 
 This ain't your average gun clap rap 
 From New York City to TPA and back 
 Make sure you pick-up a brochure or pamphlet for info 
 On how I single-handed turn drama MC hamlets in to omelets 
 Quite nicely, minus the spicy additive 
 The saddest kids at a loss for adjectives to describe these wacks shit passages 
 (Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this shit ay man, you got to get more hyped up than that) 
 (Yo, I ain't even feeling you Dutch) 
 (Verse 3: Dutchmassive) 
 Ayo commence with the gibberish 
 Face it, ain't nobody hearing shit 
 I think too much to be an imitating lyricist 
 My experience lacking of qualities of stability 
 C'mon y'all are killing me 
 I rearranged identities and ride galactic centipedes 
 More enemies to diss my ego (Nah Duke I'm just confident) 
 Battling Demigods I exit out the Alpha Project 
 Flying objects emit from the arms of order logic 
 You are all now my hostage 
 There is no escape from the carbon glass surrounding 
 You're trapped in your own bullshit ways of gettin' down kid 
 Emotion filled bastard, battle scars I have none 
 Lookin' towards the future makes me wanna purchase mad guns 
 Stunned to the fact that I act like I don't care 
 But I'm not mad at the world, just everybody living here 
 (Dutch, you still wack) 
 (Verse 4: Celph Titled) 
 Yo life's a snitch, God forbid the bitch would bore me 
 I Practice with travel sorcery, transcend velocities immortally 
 Spittin' ammunition in all directions I'm every man's fear 
 You could turn yourself invisible but you still couldn't stand clear 
 I live in the flesh, only when I'm wearin' it 
 Flow active and narrative 
 Speak with many tongues leaving MC's speechless Samaritans 
 I get more applaud than God at the Gospel Awards 
 My acceptance speech was immortalized in stone tablets before the Dinosaurs 
 Beyond the limits that are humanly possible 
 Ripping your hair out follicle by follicle 
 Diabolical vandalist, fuck graffiti artists 
 I'm the Vampire 
 I'd rather tag your name with your cardiovascular excrements 
 Motherfucker this is your last will and testament 
 Celph Titled, sincerely yours, the man who exhales toxins 
 Holdin' down the tropic state, we carry knives to cut our boxes 
 Word life, MC's act like they can flow 
 I know you fackin' Jacks cause you as hardcore as the Cosby Show
