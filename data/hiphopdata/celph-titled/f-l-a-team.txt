(Intro: Celph Titled) 
 In 1998 a rhyme commando unit dropped a classic joint by the name of 'Fortress' 
 These men promptly emerged from the Fahrenheit 813 and to the Tampa Bay underground. Today, still wanted by the masses, they survive as soldiers of hip hop. If you've got wack shit, if no one else can help and if you can find them, then maybe, you can hire the F-L-A team. 
 (Murdock) 
 Yo don't you love when a fam come together 
 Murdock, Celph Titled Tino Vega, 813 
 The F-L-A team, it ain't no stopping us now 
 It ain't going to stop 
 (Verse 1: Murdock) 
 Mother fuckers better guard your grill 
 When F-L-A team gripping the steel 
 We sitting with your bitch, slipping her pills 
 Guerilla pimping style, gripping a mil 
 When I'm flipping the real, 
 Y'all better go half before I get ill 
 Murdock come through with the chopper cocked 
 Pop, pop get up off my block, I won't stop 
 Until the cops are dropped and drops are copped 
 And comes to the spot where my dog RK flash the rock 
 Stash the glock so when it's time for the war 
 We showing up at the door, so we conquistador 
 Hop out the truck blowing smoke from the raw 
 I'm a stay high whether I'm home or on tour 
 Spit rap, flip, let a mother fuck flip that 
 Whatever get the money, I'm with that 
 And we get too deep, we better get that 
 If you cock blocking on my crew, better quit that 
 Y'all chickens in the club better get back 
 Fake cats trying to give me left had daps 
 Shorty rock look good can I hit that, 
 Come on back to the crib and let me split that 
 You with that? No doubt, I can dig that 
 G money, hell no I can't have that 
 Smack your ass to the past like a flashback 
 And you ain't smoking my weed, bitch pass that 
 All my niggas where you at (We right here) 
 Hold it down (No doubt) 
 F-L-A Team, niggas in the 813 reign supreme 
 All my bitches where you at (We right here) 
 Hold it down (No doubt) F-L-A team 
 Bitches in the 813 reign supreme 
 (Verse 2: Celph Titled) 
 Yo, fuck that, niggas wanna rumble with us 
 They going to see stomach and guts as soon as we bust 
 Fully loaded ammo, commando, Panhandle Rambo 
 Jumping out of man holes rocking camo 
 Niggas know me from the way I hold heat 
 All this with full clips and sawed off shit 
 Floridius, amphibious nigga, 
 Tampa where I'm from 
 Real heavy hitters 
 Teflon vest, Vietnam bomb threats, infrared scope low 
 Hit you with a chokehold Walkmen 2-D 
 Celph Titled keep an oozie, 
 Dime bitches be like (Who's he?) 
 This is the next level when we spit the heavy metal 
 Certified incredible and we stay ahead of you 
 Ghetto to borough we rep thorough 
 M 16 bazerko, that's for sure, though 
 Grenade shrapnel, tear gas capsules 
 Mother fucking surplus, What you want asshole 
 Grip the glock 9, nigga with the hot rhymes 
 Get your shit fucked up just off one line 
 8-1-3 to the NYC representation we stay blazing 
 Strictly for clapping, semi auto action 
 War head get trapped in all that blasting 
 All my niggas where you at (We right here) 
 Hold it down (No doubt) 
 F-L-A Team, niggas in the 813 reign supreme 
 All my bitches where you at (We right here) 
 Hold it down (No doubt) F-L-A team 
 Bitches in the 813 reign supreme 
 (Verse 3: Tino Vega) 
 You want to battle back with your averages raps 
 Got your savage strap, dick rider 
 Let the rougers fire 
 Camouflage hummer with the big tires 
 Desert Storm attire 
 Walkman nigga, never retire 
 Tino Vega blow your L's high up 
 F-L-A team we keep our guns high up 
 Atomically while you make your brain fire 
 With the desert boy, a quick dry up 
 In the tropics you can't top us 
 All you knockers really need to stop it 
 Word to logic digging in our pockets, yo 
 Hard head nigga like Canada bald bitches 
 Liquefy missiles try to miss you 
 Sludge boil when they call me leave enough gums sore 
 Can you corny, one shot from the oozie pump 
 Finish 'em up, nigga's whole body jump, end this shit up 
 You got your rhymes sucker, use your chips 
 Don't step out of line make me bruise your clique 
 I don't really give a damn who you with 
 Y'all better know who's cassette this is 
 You can pump it in the trunk of your Lexuses 
 About to show the whole world who the geneix is boy 
 All my niggas where you at (We right here) 
 Hold it down (No doubt) 
 F-L-A Team, niggas in the 813 reign supreme 
 All my bitches where you at (We right here) 
 Hold it down (No doubt) F-L-A team 
 Bitches in the 813 reign supreme 
 (Tino Vega) That's right
