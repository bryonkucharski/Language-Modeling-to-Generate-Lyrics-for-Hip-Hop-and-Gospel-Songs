(Verse 1: Apathy) 
 Shhh! Y'all gotta believe me when I say that earth girls are easy 
 Skirts fly off as soon as they hear the CD 
 Not that they hos, but the flow is so dope 
 Whether rap or the mattress, Ap's no joke 
 In a bar where the college girls shake they ass 
 Midnight, arrive fashionably late for class 
 Wondering how many lectures it takes to smash 
 But remember, only grade A can pass 
 Get her back to the dorm, she's a freak, likes porn 
 Hard to the core, that'll get her soft and warm 
 As soon as we start freaking, the bed start squeaking 
 She stops like, shhh! My roommate's sleeping 
 We ain't about to quit, baby doll wants more 
 So we switch up the style, throw a blanket on the floor 
 Blow her back out, ass drops, raise it up 
 Hold up, shh! I think your roommate's waking up 
 (Chorus: Apathy) 
 Shhh! Don't make so much noise 
 Shhh! Lower your pants, lower your voice 
 Shhh! I'm trying to keep it discreet 
 So we could kiss Shhh! Lick Shhh! What Shhh! Freak 
 Shhh! Don't make so much noise 
 Shhh! Lower your pants, lower your voice 
 Shhh! I'm trying to keep it discreet 
 So we could kiss Shhh! Lick Shhh! What Shhh! Freak 
 (Verse 2: Celph Titled) 
 Shhh! Listen, you got me all wrong 
 Thinking I get off onto some old regular shit 
 With any regular bitch, I want to skeet in your nose 
 Mommy, my fetishes are sick, I like an amazon broad 
 With F cup size titties 
 That scream loud when my stockings up in her chimney 
 But back at the crib, this ho got nine kids 
 And every sound we making have them opening they little eye lids 
 Can you imagine the trauma from them seeing they momma 
 Spread eagle with a leather coat, dressed like Madonna 
 In the kiddie pool filled with jello pudding snacks 
 Licking on my dick and shouting out where to put it at 
 (We can't have that) 
 So I'm a duct tape your grill shut 'cause we'll fuck 
 Crazy, rough and rugged, you little milf slut 
 We woke your daughter up, but no need for the tears 
 'Cause she'll be doing the same thing with me in ten years 
 (Chorus: Celph Title) 
 Shhh! Don't make so much noise 
 Shhh! Lower your pants, lower your voice 
 Shhh! I'm trying to keep it discreet 
 So we could kiss Shhh! Lick Shhh! What Shhh! Freak 
 Shhh! Don't make so much noise 
 Shhh! Lower your pants, lower your voice 
 Shhh! I'm trying to keep it discreet 
 So we could kiss Shhh! Lick Shhh! What Shhh! Freak 
 (Verse 3: Apathy) 
 I hit it so hard you think your skeletal could fracture 
 Ladies label Ap most eligible bachelor 
 She's holding her mouth when I'm going down south 
 To muffled all moans and groans is coming out 
 I put my back into it when I'm burying you 
 You barely can move cause other dudes rarely this smooth 
 I might bust but I'm not necessarily though 
 So I tell you shhh! Like librarians do, slightly tipsy 
 Liquor got her mood real kinky 
 You better act right, make sure there's no hickies 
 As for anything that's sexual, I'm incredible 
 I know it's hard to hold down, but tone down your decibels 
 Shhh! I fucked Billy Jean, make the sheets glow 
 These hos love it when I whip it like Deebo 
 Even up inside the club with my boys around 
 I like my privacy so keep the noises down 
 (Chorus: Apahty) 
 Shhh! Don't make so much noise 
 Shhh! Lower your pants, lower your voice 
 Shhh! I'm trying to keep it discreet 
 So we could kiss Shhh! Lick Shhh! What Shhh! Freak 
 (Chorus: Celph Titled) 
 Shhh! Don't make so much noise 
 Shhh! Lower your pants, lower your voice 
 Shhh! I'm trying to keep it discreet 
 So we could kiss Shhh! Lick Shhh! What Shhh! Freak
