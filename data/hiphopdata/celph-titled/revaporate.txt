(Intro: Majik Most) 
 Yeah, yo the evaporate remix 
 You got to love it 
 My man Dutchmassive 
 Me, Majik Most and Celph Titled 
 We had to come back and evaporate your face 
 With the remix 
 (Verse 1: Dutchmassive) 
 Ah, yo Majik said that I can say anything that I want 
 So I crushed this verse right under my writers block 
 Build a pyramid of punch lines and hover right above it 
 Roll out the red carpet because Dutch can't think of nothing 
 And he's such a fucking star kid, you hear all the trumpets 
 Trample on your drum while I brought my own procession 
 Fucking up the industry, rebuild as it was meant to be 
 A swift response for the God to have sent for me 
 A centipede named crazy legs couldn't out do 
 The B-boy superhuman while he's performing this music 
 Star struck rappers screw face like Jon Gruden 
 Too serious about their little underground movement 
 Press up some vinyl, hurry to do exclusives 
 Now your closet full of Pumas is filled with dusty units 
 (Just sitting there) next to the mic and the broomstick 
 Some people are just so, so stupid 
 So move bitch, get out the way 
 Equilibrium is drunk again, wiling on stage 
 Fucking up a verse, holding down the Tropic States 
 And we make emcees worldwide evaporate 
 (Verse 2: Majik Most) 
 Ay, yo, I'm off the meter, like Mr. Wizard launching two liters 
 The new and improved Majik Most with new features 
 Gnawing on your girls little breast like a beaver 
 So pack it up bitch, because I'm coming through raw 
 Kids you know I smack you with a rusted hacksaw 
 Like oh shit, is that a piece of his jaw 
 Brawling 24-7 to sever your brethren 
 Got you begging for heaven, sending you straight to hell 
 And I'll be right here, while you chilling in the morgue 
 I'm online, selling your liver on organ.org 
 Get your face thawed while your family applaud 
 For all of y'all grab the mic and never fail 
 While you go in gay bars and order a cocktail 
 Fronting in the restaurant like you was the man 
 I botch your plans, send you a batch of bad clams 
 With more botchulism than a box of canned hams, bitch! 
 (Verse 3: Celph Titled) 
 Ay yo, the words out, me and my team came to shut this down 
 And my guns came too, they want to bust some rounds 
 Cold chilling on the block like I'm selling Kane 
 Chopping bodies up, wrapping up remains in cellophane 
 Don't mean to frighten kids, I'm just a star rocking coats 
 Looking like they've made from Mary J. Blige's wigs 
 You should let your man speak on your behalf 
 Because when I let the blade slice, you'll just be half 
 And I got a dungeon in my bathroom 
 Plus the way I torture mother fuckers 
 It's like I'm Vidal Sassoon 
 Turn a blond nigga to redhead 
 Futon to a death bed, bullets keep you breast fed 
 When I'm aiming for the chest, oh now the game's over 
 At the Up in Smoke tour with a flamethrower 
 Looking for a dumb girl that's slower than a Screw tape 
 With a fat ass, never tell that bitch to lose weight 
 From Robles Park to Waters Avenue 
 One of the only rappers who 
 Takes a trip to hell every afternoon 
 And still here to tell about it 
 It's Equilibrium to the death 
 Mother fuckers get devoured
