(Verse 1: Apathy) 
 There's a whole lot of rappers 
 That claim they so street 
 But all sound the same like reggaeton beats 
 I'll swing on your jaw 
 And leave your dome piece broken 
 And spin your face quicker than a sidekick open 
 If my label doesn't get my album off of the ground 
 I'm going to rally my fans and burn your offices down 
 Radio for back up, another officer down 
 Connecticut's king, that gets back to polish my crown 
 I'm from the era when the mixtapes were standard cassettes 
 Lamped in a Lex with Nike airs and Champion sweats 
 Now a days we them psychos higher with the right flows 
 Kill ghostwriters and give your wigi board typos 
 (Verse 2: Tak) 
 Say yes, say when, we don't pack pads and pens 
 Act bad, get the crap slapped out of your friends 
 I turn rap to crack rock and sell it at base price 
 If only you could fit bass pipes in a laptop 
 It's not a problem, I take it back to the blacktop 
 The Demigod, King Kong, killer Godzilla 
 Raw spit spiller, cap peeler don with the gat cocked 
 Style of Beyond and on and on 
 Yeah we chill with Jay-Z but I call him Shawn 
 It ain't nothing, I crush him until they chest is flat 
 So clap for the rap fucking phenomenon 
 (Make 'em clap to this) 
 (Verse 3: Motive) 
 Yo, I'm here now 
 So don't worry where I came from 
 If you trying to find this nigga weakness 
 It ain't none 
 See I could spit some shit 
 That can leave your brain numb 
 My aim is to bring the game back 
 To what it changed from 
 Niggas is fake though 
 Garbage and I see through it 
 Hate mo is marketing yayo like G-Unit 
 The Godz a squad and yes, we rap cousin 
 And now we back like we mother fucking left something 
 And I ain't with none of that backpack rap shit 
 But I do keep a mac in my bag if you act slick 
 And when it get pulled, it disperse with a clip full 
 With a bite that's worse than a pit bull 
 (Verse 4: Ryu) 
 We close to the top, if not, it ain't far 
 My choice, it must be the voice, the next Gang Starr 
 So taste the brand of amphetamines for your whole squad 
 You sniffing this, you'll swear to God 
 You saw me landing a spaceship 
 Robotic hands with legs and animal faces 
 Chopping the grains of sand to side of bacon 
 An exact spiting image of animal Satan 
 Carrying Los Angeles on his back for ages 
 Whoa, crush the razors, sip the wine 
 The Demigodz invasion cripple your mind 
 I'm a tell 'em again, ripped cat, dude from S.O. 
 Stand up for the jam, heat clap, now let's go 
 (Verse 5: Celph Titled) 
 Reporting live from the planet of the disturbed 
 You'll think we smoke a massive amount of weed 
 Cause of the way we hit herbs 
 Now which word got you offended 
 I give a fuck and since an infant, I've been a misfit 
 You see the way the kid spit 
 I've got Raven Symone craving my bone 
 Cat fighting with Hillary Duff putting artillery up 
 (And they don't know) 
 The Demigodz a force to be reckoned with 
 (So play your part) 
 Or get a tek to your neck and shit 
 Yes, I'm with a naked bitch all night 
 All night with a blow job, she careful around my waist 
 Because a gun might go off 
 Hip hop to you is probably Color Me Bad 
 But it's a fact I've been down 
 Since Michael Jackson was black 
 (Verse 6: Esoteric) 
 E.S. like a slasher flick, master sick, 
 Waste to leave cats hacked to bits 
 At the same time relax with the Maxium chicks 
 Snatching flicks because you know I won't remember that shit 
 Pass the fifth, Demigodz a squad, we're ruthless 
 You're useless like blind men with pool sticks 
 Exclusive Nike's ain't exclusive 
 When they're found on the feet of every doofus 
 Your man's a goner, that thug persona 
 Makes me laugh like Jon Voight in Anaconda 
 The pterodactyl is back, I'm landing on ya 
 86 Rocket, Ralph Sampson on ya 
 Larry Legend leaving the gym at 2 a.m. 
 Carrying weapons
