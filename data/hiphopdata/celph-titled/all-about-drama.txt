It's all about drama 
 Yeah, and that's the way that it is 
 It's all about drama 
 Yeah, and that's the way that it is 
 (Verse 1: Big Scoob) 
 Man I sell drama, wholesale prices, Big Scoob 
 Come to my hood and you leave iceless 
 Feel the pain that the streets could bring 
 Feel the slugs as they hit your brain 
 BK, push through, leaving you homesick 
 Brownsville niggas make you run home quick 
 It's like a bowling ball on your forehead 
 You can't fight, lay your whole team down, just like a strike 
 I'm real with it, you can find me on the hill with it 
 Bring your gun you can still get killed with it 
 Two headed nickel, no tell when the cops come 
 We bring drama like dum-da-dum-dum 
 Trendsetters, crazy, don't make me murder your baby, your baby 
 Y'all niggas wear bubble gum drawers just to pop shit 
 J-Fame, Sleepy, Vegas, all hot shit 
 It's all about drama 
 Yeah, and that's the way that it is 
 It's all about drama 
 Yeah, and that's the way that it is 
 (Verse 2: Sleepy Eyes) 
 Ay, yo, let me get a paper to write 
 Plus a pen to use, I run through tracks like 
 Carl Lewis tennis shoes 
 Run through packs and market my chemicals 
 Hump hood rats who gargle my genitals 
 Models and interludes, 
 The big chrome that I ride shoot through your alloys 
 And swallow your inner tubes, I bend the rules 
 Play dirty like James Worthy 
 And quick with tools 
 Flame 30 at Jake 30 
 I skip through school 
 Play early at 8:30 
 Your clique is fools I place birdies 
 In grace early, I do this rap shit 
 For my bitches and thugs 
 Till them out of town niggas 
 Getting triples for drugs 
 Spot runners to the young chicks stripping in clubs 
 Hoop riders sticking 'em up and switching to dubs 
 I spit like a pistol with slugs 
 So devoted, I play the block for nickels and bubs 
 (Verse 3: Celph Titled) 
 Now I might hustle some crack just to feed my seeds 
 But I ain't got none, so every red cent is for me 
 On Columbian blocks, posting up 
 Ballsy enough to sling yayo there 
 You can say I got cocoanuts 
 Knock, knock open up 
 Guess who it is 
 It's that boy Celph Titled with a gun to your kids 
 And my CD booklet got some 3D crook shit 
 Blueprints, diagrams and recipes to cook with 
 Any day of the week, I'm letting the tool spray 
 No need for an appointment can shoot for Tuesday 
 I got guns and songs and songs about guns 
 Had gold fronts in '92, robbing kids for Nike shoes 
 Look at the life we choose, we ain't just some rappers 
 We fill coliseums, wile out and hang from rafters 
 Valedictorian from the school of hard knocks 
 So fuck Dow Jones, my rifles got large stocks 
 (Verse 4: Ali Vegas) 
 Ay, yo, I flow nice, seven digits show price 
 Struggle my whole life, hustle and roll dice 
 In the hood with the Gods, Vegas 'cause I'm good with the cards 
 While niggas was flipping packs, I was getting stacks 
 With a few hands of eights and few hands of penny pack 
 I can get 'em smacked with the mac, but I ain't really into that 
 Young Carl Bruce, swifter than mongoose, do a block with my arms loose 
 Palming my orange juice, look I live the hard knock life 
 Dickies suit, Caterpillar, Carhartt life 
 The prince don't get along with cats 
 Ice grill me, here's a cold shoulder to go along with that 
 I usually perform with cats, but I'm back to my biz 
 Ali Vegas uprising, that's what it is 
 Eyes low, one of the illest from Queens 
 And I'm a body every young rapper until I'm the king, mother fucker
