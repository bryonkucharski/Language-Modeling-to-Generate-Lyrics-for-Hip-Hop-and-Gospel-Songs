(Verse 1: The Allmighty Trem One (Lyrical Commission) 
 This is all out war with a fallout sure to cause a backlash 
 I'll bash in your fucking face, I don't stab backs 
 Trem's attacking rappers with a thirst for blood 
 Submerge your body in a river shoved in a Persian rug 
 Eternal come for curtains, that's a certainty 
 Leaving third degree burns from these first degree murder sprees 
 Earning me and my verse and these words global praise 
 I throw grenades when I flow and set the show ablaze 
 A fire bug for hire shrugging the comp off 
 Plug in the micro bomb, soft cunts to compost 
 We from a long lost planet where rap is real 
 Still intact and untapped by the mass appeal 
 Market, LC spark and blast targets 
 Master the craft and kick it raw like a carcass 
 Lyrical Commission's carving a path with rotor blades 
 We roll deeper in the streets than a motorcade 
 (Verse 2: Brad Strut (Lyrical Commission) 
 I'm barely breathing, bleeding, heart rate increasing 
 It's fire stakes, I can't take fakes and thieves 
 And past mistakes seep in through the gaps of my armour 
 Ain't nothing what it seems as I battle with snake charmers 
 Paint you a portrait, I got a sword, just not cautious, do what I want 
 My squads forces hard to handle like a grenade on detonation 
 Rock the candles, a parade of devastation 
 Defend the nation while I step inside your earlobes 
 And carve you split of slick spits and I don't fear no man 
 You need heroes, all I want is beer, blow some weed and type speech 
 Some beats and reap zero, disrespect, I hinder reps with heavy burden 
 Get in your head, and leave you left for dead, they're calling curtains 
 This shit's superb in your Car or Walkman, go stalking an important 
 Public figure's Strut is a slick assassinator, four fours caught in an elixir 
 Sworn to fascinate you with scorn joining the mix, it's life and death 
 In this business, it's kind of sad, but I define my track with death scriptures 
 (Verse 3: Celph Titled) 
 There ain't a mother fucker been in more fights than me 
 OG's in my hood ain't got more stripes than me 
 Celph Titled is known to tote but when I ain't packing 
 I keep a buck fifty so we can get it cracking 
 And if you throw slugs, you better pray they graze your chin 
 You said you had an infrared, but that was just a laser pen 
 Just the site of me will make you strain to breathe 
 I shoot till I'm satisfied, I aim to please 
 And you ain't got more ammo than me, with clips there's no contender 
 In my house we keep gun oil in liquid soap dispensers 
 You shouldn't let your mouth flap, 'cause I'm a put you under 
 And I ain't talking about the Outback 
 In New York I'm grungy, In Australia, I'm Dundee 
 Cooking barbecue with just the smoke from my gun heat 
 People get comfy with a pillow in the face 
 The Demigodz and the Commission filling body bags by the case 
 (Verse 4: Bob Balans) 
 The world leaves the forgotten to lurk in the waste 
 That's why I don't trust, I hurdle through space 
 With a thrust and peril is safe from the payback 
 'Cause where I stay you fight for a placemat 
 And I don't say cat, 'cause where I grew up that meant faggot 
 But I do leaves tracks po'wed and flattered 
 Staked in habit, daggered, when I unsheathe the mic from the scabbard 
 And uphold the standard cause your fates borrowed 
 So check the horrid scars on your face and forehead 
 In hostile territory like foreign embassy 
 LC start a war, now we're the common enemy 
 Execute you to a tight schedule 
 Get the general, the rest are expendable 
 Melt ya, every decibel held ya in a molten tank 
 Until it's over your scalp and there's nothing left for burial 
 Your aluminum in the smolder stay crushed, the heavy fuel 
 Expels the metal shells in your shelter 
 Arial assault leave you pumped like a propeller
