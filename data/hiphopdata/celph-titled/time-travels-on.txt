[Scratches]: 
 "Time goes on" 
 [Chorus] [Celph Titled]: 
 I can only see the roads I've been down 
 Been tryin' to move forward in my life for so long now 
 To seize the day might not ease the pain 
 But the hourglass never takes a break 
 Time travels on 
 Time. Travels. On 
 "Time goes on" 
 Time travels on 
 Time. Travels. On 
 "Time goes on" 
 Time travels on 
 [Verse One] [Celph Titled]: 
 As I 
 Get lost in a cloud of smoke 
 I just started my day but it ain't your average hours though 
 Most of the time that the mic's ripped, I'm on a night shift 
 Seems to be the only time I write shit 
 Easier to say, "Seize the day" 
 They was here yesterday but now they gone away 
 I hope it ain't lights out 
 I hope it's something nice on the other side 
 Even though I spit lyrics that makes mothers cry 
 Memories fade every minute that pass (by) 
 But when I'm gone you'll still hear my voice when the song blast (right) 
 So make the best of your time here 
 Let your loved ones know that you care 
 'Cause they ain't always gonna be there 
 You better plant seeds for your future to grow 
 Don't procrastinate bullshit or move too slow 
 I used to be depressed about this life of mine but now this clock is my medicine 
 I get better with time 
 Time travels on 
 [Chorus] [Celph Titled]: 
 I can only see the roads I've been down 
 Been tryin' to move forward in my life for so long now 
 To seize the day might not ease the pain 
 But the hourglass never takes a break 
 Time travels on 
 Time. Travels. On 
 "Time goes on" 
 Time travels on 
 Time. Travels. On 
 "Time goes on" 
 "One two" 
 [Verse Two] [Majik Most]: 
 I'm thinkin' about my mom 
 As time travels on 
 Dead and gone 
 Died unexpected 
 Depression, a billion bad thoughts, brain infected 
 Suffocation, deep contemplation 
 Just thinkin' and waitin' like she's comin' back 
 But facts is facts and my heart is black 
 I'd give up anything for her to be here 
 Just five minutes 
 I could whisper in her ear 
 "I love you" but in my heart you'll always be near 
 Never again will I waste the opportunity 
 The lunacy (so stupid) 
 To think for eternity, there will always be 
 And not just a memory 
 Don't intend to be too busy for your family 
 Cause time travels on but this song is a part of me 
 For you to see 
 Don't take them for granted 
 The worst fate is when it's too late to understand it 
 [Chorus] [Celph Titled]: 
 I can only see the roads I've been down 
 Been tryin' to move forward in my life for so long now 
 To seize the day might not ease the pain 
 But the hourglass never takes a break 
 Time travels on 
 Time. Travels. On 
 "Time goes on" 
 Time travels on 
 Time. Travels. On 
 "Time goes on" 
 Time travels on 
 [Verse Three] [DutchMassive]: 
 This might be 
 The only chance I have 
 To tell you that I love you and I'm sorry for the past 
 Take it or just leave it but I mean it and I'm glad 
 But it's sad when they misinterpretate how I act 
 If not, I journey on a separate path 
 Embrace the memories before my heart is split in half 
 Though half isn't accurate 
 Cause every single person on this earth is attached to it 
 Our journey's passionate 
 To live life as I imagine it 
 And time on this earth is so precious 
 So with each new second I'm alive I'm attackin' it 
 The fact is that I'm gracious 
 I'm thankful for life's sudden changes 
 The struggle, I'm humble and patient 
 Ashamed that you left 'cause I'm destined for greatness
