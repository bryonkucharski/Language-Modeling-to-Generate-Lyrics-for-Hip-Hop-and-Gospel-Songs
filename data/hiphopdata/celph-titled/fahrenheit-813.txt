(Intro: Celph Titled) 
 What we've come across here is something 
 That most of y'all don't know about 
 So if we promise to let you know what the deal is 
 Y'all got to promise to listen 
 (Chorus: Majik Most) 
 Fahrenheit 8-1-3 yo 
 Check that degree 
 Check that degree 
 Fahrenheit 8-1-3 yo, yo 
 Check that degee 
 Check that degree 
 Fahrenheit 8-1-3 yo, yo 
 Check that degee 
 Check that degree 
 Fahrenheit 8-1-3 yo 
 Check that degee 
 Check that degree 
 (Verse 1: Dutchmasive) 
 Area code, octo uno tri Faherenheit 
 Swamp land, palm trees subparadise 
 No need for subways, we roam the city bus 
 Biodome a building block, walkmans are a must 
 I thrust attached to the back of a determined reptilian 
 Mad as fuck always dissing Floridians 
 Flood water is serious, snap the neck of most tourists 
 The vocals from a tropic state emcee can be poisonous 
 Avoid the underground railroad at 88.5 
 Or F-L-A hip hop broken down in the hive 
 I'm a strive making water aqua district you abused in 
 Not every southern melody you hear is booty music 
 I'm a run through shit, yo, Bay sound record my voice 
 I'm a be an Everglades emcee, I have no choice 
 Fuck a coast, Dutchmassive represent where alias 
 My residency is TPA, it's like society of intelligence 
 (Chorus: Majik Most) 
 Fahrenheit 8-1-3 yo 
 Check that degree 
 Check that degree 
 Fahrenheit 8-1-3 yo, yo 
 Check that degee 
 Check that degree 
 Fahrenheit 8-1-3 yo, yo 
 Check that degee 
 Check that degree 
 Fahrenheit 8-1-3 yo 
 Check that degee 
 Check that degree 
 (Verse 2: Majik Most) 
 As I spit the prefix, all eyes transfixed 
 To the first tribe with archives 
 Advisers step up, amped up 
 Focused on my abnormal growth 
 Progression progression as hip hop moves on 
 Medal back support placed for torque 
 I stand strong through the Farenheits 
 Majik Most grabs the mic 
 Reveal my inner talent 
 Reign violent in your sector 
 Perfecter of the sound 
 Projects visions legendary 
 I carry the devastation to your face 
 In the place to be, my city represents me 
 The most elevated, but located below sea level 
 Uplifted peninsula, swung from east to west 
 Strike the country with humidity, swiftly 
 Sweaty back bastard from the 8-1-3 
 Emcee or monstrosities 
 Blasting adrenalin while Cramtroniks 
 Backspins with four arms 
 Emerging from his abdomen 
 (Chorus: Majik Most) 
 Fahrenheit 8-1-3 yo 
 Check that degree 
 Check that degree 
 Fahrenheit 8-1-3 yo, yo 
 Check that degee 
 Check that degree 
 Fahrenheit 8-1-3 yo, yo 
 Check that degee 
 Check that degree 
 Fahrenheit 8-1-3 yo 
 Check that degee 
 Check that degree 
 (Verse 3: Unknown [Not Celph]) 
 I de-grit my teeth and rip my chords at sound receivers 
 Make sure I shine for stage perceivers 
 Make doubting niggas become believers 
 Create an irreversible friction without holding heat 
 Packing a 44 centimeter blade in liquid concrete 
 Silent, suffocate off of the salt water concentrate 
 Of this whole tropic state 
 I'm inclined with 8 hundred and 13 sonic calisthenics 
 Magnificently harmonistic in this song 
 That since we fixed, asphyxiation 
 Construct 50 foot needles on every building top 
 So all you big timers can never sleep on Tampa hip hop 
 Foundations get broken as my language is spoken 
 Bet you can take that as a token, when I get you open 
 I.E. the next time you hear the vibrations 
 Within my voice box, the game plan is Cyclops 
 Only one way that you can see me 
 Reincarnating, try your best of being me 
 Equilibrium's the balance of the mind 
 And silence of divine
