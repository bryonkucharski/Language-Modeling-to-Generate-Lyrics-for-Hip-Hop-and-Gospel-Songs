(Celph Speaking) 
 Whattup whattup whattup 
 (Crypt Speaking) 
 Yo, OS, Celph Titled baby 
 What's goin' down 
 (Celph Speaking) 
 My niggaz, yo spit that shit 
 (Crypt The Warchild) 
 I'ma known beast sick with it full blown speech 
 Buryin' bones deep beneath the stone streets 
 Stampedin the globe deep with the Pharaohs so don't sleep 
 We flame arrow your dome piece but when these cannibals go eat 
 I'ma cannon with no leash no hammer and no heat 
 Spit at random anytime acapella with no beat 
 Believe me dog cyclop vision I see through fog 
 Y'all transparent niggaz on tape I see through y'all 
 Like a crystal ball, my dogs gnaw till ya tissues gone shook 
 When niggaz ran to they pistols to hit you hard 
 This games a fixed neck, go ahead and pick your card 
 Like playin' Russian roulette by yaself on a trip to Mars 
 I break atoms in the same fashion I spit these bars 
 Put barbwire on my mic rip it tight till it slips and scars 
 Outerspace get it right we shift and drift from y'all 
 Outerspace get it right we shift and drift from y'all 
 (Outerspace X2) 
 It's a revolution, a new state of mind 
 We bringin' hip hop back with new ways to rhyme 
 Yesterday it was dark but today we shine 
 Tryin' to make the best out these last days in time 
 (Planetary) 
 Stick me in a room with a track Celph Title made 
 No tellin' where my ink flow it's like a tidal wave 
 Battle emcees dog I survived those days 
 Now it's murderous spittin' fire those pyros crave 
 Makin' joints from the gutter, the grittiest rhyme 
 Sorry if you think I'm rude I get too shitty at times 
 I'm with Crypt on barstools talkin' rep, cars and pool 
 Tryin' to build foundation with no garage and tools 
 With a squad that bruise anybody who act 
 Outta order Q-Demented will demolish you cats 
 Outta water outta food, we grisslin' niggaz 
 Don't speak, 'cause you know your body fittin' in rivers 
 Don't sleep, does who slept don't pose a threat 
 We runnin' with the Army now Pharaohs to the death 
 We are, what you hard renegades wanna be 
 We spit regardless, no matter center stage or the street 
 (Celph Titled) 
 Yo, first off let me say fuck you and fuck dead homies 
 You got beef with me you got beef with my cronies 
 And when it come to machineguns, we fire Tommy's like Sony 
 Leave you missin' from your tribe like Jahrobee 
 We block buster spot rushers; my shots musta' 
 Let off from the glock and sprayed you down like crop dusters 
 I rock mustard color Timbs the same ones that busted ya chin 
 Celph Titled and Outerspace the spicks is at it again 
 Get a number for it to drop through 
 See me with a 4-4 when I drop through 
 That's my bitch and I don't think she likes you 
 And all that bullshit about let there be light 
 It wasn't that easy plus I gave life to Christ 
 Immortalized my story noticed that I eternally rep 
 Bring mother Mary to Maury Povich paternity test 
 Their ain't a nigga that can play, that's preposterous G 
 'Cause I'll make sure ya album is released posthumously
