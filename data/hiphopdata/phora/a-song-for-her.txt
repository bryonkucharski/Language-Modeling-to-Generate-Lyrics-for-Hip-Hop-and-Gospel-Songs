What is love, love? 
 Is it you and I, sharing lips under the scenery of the bluish sky? 
 If I told you I loved you would it be true to lie? 
 I'll let you decide, I'll let you decide 
 What is love, love? 
 Is it you and I, sharing lips under the scenery of the bluish sky? 
 If I told you I loved you would it be true to lie? 
 I'll let you decide, I'll let you decide 
 I'd spend the rest of my days with you 
 There ain't no other way I'd choose to use my time 
 If it's okay with you let's leave the booze behind 
 And maybe get a snow cone or somethin' 
 Girl you got my heart beating in slow-mo or somethin' 
 No rush, let's let fate take its course 
 I mean, we can move fast but I can wait of course 
 And you kiss me when I'm sick 
 You say you don't want me to leave 
 'Cause you feel lonely and you miss me when I split 
 I wanna tell the world how much I love you 
 I wanna show everyone that I'm softer than a pillow when I hug you 
 My friends make fun, they say that touchy shit is dumb 
 But I don't care 'cause it's the truth 
 That's how I feel when I'm amongst you 
 I've got a good spirit and good intentions 
 But your friends disagreeing they say you shouldn't listen 
 To the things I have to say, but your choice is ultimately up to you 
 I just hope you think of me throughout the day 
 What is love, love? 
 Is it you and I, sharing lips under the scenery of the bluish sky?

 I'll let you decide, I'll let you decide

 I'll let you decide, I'll let you decide 
 I'd spend the rest of my days with you 
 There ain't no other way I'd choose to use my time 
 Even if I'm not with you I'm keeping you in mind 
 I can't say that we never fight 
 But it's nothing that we can't fix whenever you spend the night 
 You know what I'm talkin' about baby, I can't keep you a secret 
 I wanna scream until the people believe it 
 That it's possible to find love, and even though we ain't perfect 
 I give you my best 'cause you deserve it (deserve it) 
 I get the tingles every time you call me baby 
 Touch my hands and kiss me on the neck, girl you amaze me 
 I ain't got no shame in showing off my lady 
 'Cause I don't want nobody else, and my friends say I'm crazy 
 But I never pay attention to the negative comments 
 'Cause I've got a girl who's gentle and honest 
 And when I say I love you, I mean that shit sincerely 
 Girl I love you dearly and that sentence is a genuine promise 
 When I need someone to talk to you're the first person I think of 
 Always there whenever I need ya 
 So I gotta thank you for everything that you do for me 
 Taking care of me while I'm sick and ditching your school for me 
 And the love that you show me is something new to me 
 I hope that you just don't get too used to me 
 Hate it when you pop my pimples, but I think it's kinda cute 
 Just wanna make you happy, tell me what I gotta do 
 You watchin' TV as I write this but right now I'm watchin' you 
 And I really hope you like this 'cause I wrote this song for you
