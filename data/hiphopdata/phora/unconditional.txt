Yeah, one two, yeah, one two 
 Mic check, mic check 
 We on? 
 Well, I tried to call you the other day, but 
 I ain't get no answer so 
 I just figured I'll let this out right here 
 Yeah, we used to roll deep in grannies whip like we owned it 
 My first Mickey's you twisted it, popped it open 
 Two kids that never had nothing going 
 Not knowing what lies ahead just livin' life in the moment 
 Shit, we come from the same place, got the same blood 
 Your mother, my father, they did the same drugs 
 No matter what happens family is family 
 I'll never hate either of them dawg it's always been the same love 
 Listen homie you can't hate her forever 
 Gotta realize, that's what made us change for the better 
 When you was going through it, I was going through it too 
 No one understood me but you, we had to make it together 
 You showed me Dogg Pound, Eazy-E, N.W.A. 
 Told me "When times get tough it take the troubles away" 
 So many times I felt like runnin' away 
 Stayed strong and honestly you part of the reason I'm something today 
 One bedroom apartment, six people inside it 
 It was a million different ways for things to get violent 
 So we kept to ourselves, thought we'd be dead or in jail 
 Cause society only gave us directions to fail 
 Everybody got ups and downs, our surroundin' was tough 
 Our family was broke, never had clothes just some raggedy Chuck's 
 Felt like the only kids that clownin' was us 
 What matters is who's down for you when you down 
 Not who's down when you up, y'know? 
 (After all the things we've been through 
 I know that we've had issues, but I would never diss you) 
 Truth is I used to look up to you 
 But I'll never forgive you enough to fuck with you 
 This whole situation got me uncomfortable 
 But that'll never change the fact I'll always have love for you 
 Wrote my first rhyme, drank my first brew with you 
 When I was taggin' even started a crew with you 
 Beef with everyone who ain't cool with you 
 But then you turn around and say shit behind my back 
 Man I'm through with you 
 What happened to us dawg, we used to be cool? 
 Tell everyone it was me, I say the same about you, damn 
 You say I changed, you sayin' I flipped the script 
 But every time I'm around I try to talk and you split 
 Love in, Love out, that's the way it's supposed to be 
 You said "Never turn on family", but you turn your back on, me 
 Talkin' shit to my sister you overstepped it 
 Outta everyone I know you was the last one I expected 
 We used to dream of this music shit, we was only kids 
 We dreamed of rocking stages, we dreamed of goin' big 
 But what good is a dream come true 
 If the person you was dreaming with ain't there too 
 Now I can't lie and say I ain't hurt 
 But being close as I was again it just can't work 
 So if I never see you again, just know you never lost my love 
 You just lost you a friend, and that's real 
 (After all the things we've been through 
 I know that we've had issues, but I would never diss you)
