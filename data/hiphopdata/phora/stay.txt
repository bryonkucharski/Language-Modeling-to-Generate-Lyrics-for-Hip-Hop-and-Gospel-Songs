I know it's getting late, but you should stay awhile 
 Got a couple things that me and you should conversate about 
 Really happy so I find it kinda crazy how 
 Saw the little things you do for me that 
 Always make me smile 
 It might take awhile for you to understand my ways 
 Make the days count never count the days 
 You don't have to leave baby you can crash with me 
 It's cold, plus it's raining out so tell me if you plan to stay 
 All the others before you never meant shit to me, they history 
 And don't even deserve to be a memory 
 You're the voice to my soul is solid as concrete 
 The flow to my bloodstream, the drums to my heart beat 
 Tell me what's on your mind girl, I hope it's me 
 Look straight into my eyes girl, what do you see? 
 I wanna show you how I feel like I think I can explain it now 
 So baby tell me what's the deal ya can you stay awhile? 
 Look, Wanna show you I'm different baby and I can prove it 
 'Cause when I dedicate myself I put my life into it 
 And I wanna take you to places you've never been 
 Show you things you've never seen, hope you find yourself a thing 
 And I'll give you my heart if you want it 
 I say you take a chance 'cause tomorrow ain't promised 
 And to be honest, It's all up to you 
 We can show each other off and show them all how we do 
 But forget about them niggas that you've dealt with in the past 
 I made a promise to myself it's gonna last 
 I'mma gonna treat you like a queen, deserved to be treated like 
 Just give it some time and I'll be sure you can sleep at night 
 Knowing you got a man that, loves and appreciates you 
 But just don't be too surprised when all these females hate you 
 But the clock is ticking, tell me before your times up 
 You gonna stay awhile? Baby make your mind up 
 Tell me what's on your mind girl, I hope it's me 
 Look straight into my eyes girl what do you see? 
 I wanna show you how I feel like I think I can explain it now 
 So baby tell me what's the deal ya can you stay awhile?
