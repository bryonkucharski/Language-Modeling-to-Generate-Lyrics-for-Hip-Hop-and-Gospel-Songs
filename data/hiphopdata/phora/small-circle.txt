I got a long road ahead of me, but I'm moving steadily 
 Tried to stay away from fake niggas and they jealousy 
 So best believe I keep my circle small 
 No time for bullshit, man I heard it all

 Sometimes this life ain't what you always think 
 I'm running from the pain I never watch how much I drink 
 All these motherfuckers talkin' bout wassup with me 
 I'll be in your city soon, guess you gotta come and see 
 And lately I been stressing. I ain't sleeping comfortably 
 Maybe 'cause my ex told me she 'bout to have another me 
 But she got a man and I got a girl 
 And we ain't capable of raising a kid in this world 
 Man I just don't know what to do, I just don't now what the fuck to do 
 'Cause I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired 
 I just wanna live my life, but everyday that passes by 
 Seems like nothing new 
 Same drama, same motherfuckers talking shit (they ain't walking) 
 Same haters all up on my dick 
 Worry about yourself and leave me alone 
 Momma' keeps telling me I need to be home 
 So I tell her I'mma visit soon, because she miss me and I miss her too 
 But we both know that I got shit to do 
 So I got "Forgive Me Mother" tattooed 
 I'm bout to be a man soon 
 Despite your mistakes you could catch your dreams 
 Homie I'm living proof! 
 J craft taught me never stop till I accomplish 
 Shit "Haters Gonna Hate" 
 Yeah I know that's what Sinonyx said 
 And everyone I hang around, I learned from 'em 
 Never did nobody wrong, maybe they just didn't deserve nothing 
 Long road ahead of me, but I'm moving steadily 
 Tried to stay away from fake niggas and they jealousy 
 So best believe I keep my circle small 
 No time for bullshit, man I heard it all 
 I seen so many friends turn to enemies 
 So many of the homies girlfriends tryna get with me 
 So many haters 'cause I'm someone that they'll never be 
 But I just let them be 
 'Cause every fucking time they mention me 
 They only make me stronger, but they don't realize it 
 I have no hate for these niggas nah they just need some goddest 
 And when they talk shit 
 I think about 500 Benz that 2Pac was talkin' 'bout 
 And I just picture me inside it 
 All eyes on me! Nigga face the facts! 
 Even with the fame I still ain't got a steady place to crash 
 Cast used to diss me 
 Call me up tryna take it back 
 And I tell 'em is cool 
 'Cause I know that I made mistakes in fact... 
 I know I've made way over my limit 
 But I'm hoping karma just gives me some 
 Fucking time to fix it 
 'Cause they keep telling me not to change 
 But I swear Lord I'm tryna change 
 And it's hard to not focus on the paper 
 When yo momma ain't got money for the bills 
 So I work my ass off till I'm drained 
 Next day do the same 
 Hoping next year I could move her to the hills 
 Yeah, move her to the hills 
 They tell me never sale out 
 But all my shows are sold out 
 And they ask me if I'm willing to die for it I say no doubt! 
 Only 17, and they probably don't understand... 
 I'm still just a kid that's tryna become a man 
 I got a long road ahead of me, but I'm moving steadily 
 Tried to stay away from fake niggas and they jealousy 
 So best believe I keep my circle small 
 No time for bullshit, man I heard it all
