He had the heart of a soldier in a city full of bandits 
 Ran with the cold spirits, couple of bad habits 
 Heart full of pain and a pipe full of magic 
 Getting him high, he's feeling like he's ready to die 
 But his girl just told him she pregnant, he don't know what to do 
 The word "Father" was just something that he never knew 
 So how's he gonna be one 
 How's he gonna raise child in a city full of demons 
 When his mother had three sons 
 And two of em' dead, one took two to the head 
 The other took three to the heart, he never knew what was said 
 But he knows, he's all his mother got now 
 He ain't got no feelings, they say he's numb to the pain 
 He on the corner with the Glock now 
 Momma always told him he was God's son 
 But he's feeling like the Devils advocate 
 Running streets with the lost ones 
 And he don't wanna lose touch with his soul 
 But he's feeling like he ain't got nowhere to go 
 Nowhere to go 
 He wanted to be like Nas, Biggie and Pac 
 He used to bump em' in his uncles whip until he got shot 
 The first time he ever saw tears coming from his mother's eyes 
 Too young to understand, so he just wondered why 
 He always used to ask the Lord if heaven had a ghetto 
 And when he tries to end it all, he just can't seem to let go 
 He shed so many tears, so many times, so many lies 
 All he feels in his heart is hate, so he never cries 
 He's running with the pack like a wild coyote 
 Running the city sticking nigga's up like "Pay what you owe me" 
 It's just him against the world, all his homeboys turned on him 
 They plotting to get him, they asking "What's the word on him?" 
 They heard his mother stayed a few blocks down 
 Hopped in the ride, got to the house and let off some rounds 
 Twenty-five shots through the window, ten through the door 
 Opened his eyes and he seen his mother dead on the floor 
 Mother forgive me
