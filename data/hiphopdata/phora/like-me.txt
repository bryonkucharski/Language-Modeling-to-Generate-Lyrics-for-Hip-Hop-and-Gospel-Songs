Girl if I was him 
 I'd never make you feel like that 
 Hate to be blunt 
 But I just gotta keep it real like that 
 I'll never know why 
 He wanna make you feel like that 
 But if you were mine babe 
 Yeah if you were mine babe 
 If you were mine 
 I would give you all the love 
 That you need from me 
 Treat you like you're royalty 
 You're a queen to me 
 I'mma show you what you're worth 
 What you mean to me 
 Probably make you fall in love 
 Make you fiend for me 
 Fuck you so good till you dream of me 
 Ain't no question I got you 
 Girl it's just something about you 
 I don't know no one 
 That's good enough for you 
 But baby that nigga 
 Ain't nothing without you 
 She just wanna roll in the benzo 
 Roll one up 
 Blow the smoke out the window 
 Said she only gets high 
 When she feel low 
 And she tryna hide her feelings 
 But her friends know 
 Her friends know 
 That she better off alone 
 Should've left that nigga 
 Momma even said 
 She don't respect that nigga 
 Wish she never met that nigga 
 Baby girl you should move on 
 And forget that nigga 
 For a nigga like me 
 'Cause I can guarantee 
 He ain't never did it like me 
 I ain't saying you need a nigga like me 
 But I can tell you ain't happy 
 Where you at right now 
 Way to good to take him back 
 Right now 
 So where you at right now... 
 He got nothing to say 
 He just wanna fuck around 
 He just stuck in his ways 
 Hes no different from these niggas 
 They all one in the same 
 And every time he fucks you over 
 You're the one that he blames 
 Look 
 To be honest girl 
 You better off alone 
 Always worried bout who sending 
 Them messages to his phone 
 You don't need him baby 
 You deserve better 
 You should've known 
 You was better off on your own 
 But these things take time 
 Girl he wasn't loyal 
 He was fucking with your mind 
 Not saying I'm better 
 But that won't happen if you're mine 
 Baby not ever 
 He did you wrong so many times 
 You looking for something 
 You ain't never gonna find 
 'Cause you way to good 
 For a nigga not to give you 
 What you need 
 You deserve better 
 You need someone like me (like me) 
 No telling what that might be... 
 I ain't saying you need a nigga like me 
 But I can guarantee 
 He ain't never did it like me 
 I ain't saying you need a nigga like me 
 But I can tell 
 You ain't happy where you at right now 
 Way to good to take him back right now 
 So where you at right now 
 I ain't saying you need a nigga like me 
 I ain't saying you need a nigga like me 
 But I can tell you ain't happy 
 Where you at right now 
 You way to good 
 To take him back right now 
 So where you at right now... 
 So where you at right now... 
 So where you at right now... 
 I can tell you ain't happy 
 Where you at right now 
 You way to good 
 To take him back right now 
 So where you at right now... 
 I ain't saying you need a nigga like me 
 But I can guarantee 
 He ain't never did it like me 
 I ain't saying you need a nigga like me 
 But I can tell 
 You ain't happy where you at right now 
 Way to good to take him back right now 
 So where you at right now
