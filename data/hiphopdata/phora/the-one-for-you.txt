I regret the things that I've done to you 
 But I just got too much pride to go run to you 
 I never stopped feeling the love for you 
 I just stopped being the one for you 
 Yeah, the love I have for you is irreplaceable, yeah 
 I know I made my share of mistakes with you 
 I know I broke your heart 
 But I wish I could pick up every single piece 
 And put 'em all back in place for you 
 But you see, the truth is 
 The both of us know, the pain is always there 
 But sometimes it don't really show 
 Sometimes we run from what we already know 
 But I gotta be honest right now, baby I don't wanna let go 
 See, I feel the distance, and every time we talk 
 I feel like something's missing 
 I thought you were the one, but it just feels so different 
 Even my heart tells me to leave 
 But I still don't listen 'cause I don't want nobody else 
 If I had one wish, I just want you all to myself 
 But it's hard to give love when it's love that you've never felt 
 See, I feel the pain deep in my blood 
 It's crazy how we love people that hurt us and hurt people we love 
 I regret the things that I've done to you 
 But I just got too much pride to go run to you 
 I never stopped feeling the love for you 
 I just stopped being the one for you 
 You tryna fight me and I'm tryna speak to you 
 This thing we call love, what does it mean to you? 
 I pull out your seat for you 
 I'm loyal and sweet to you 
 Tryin' to explain baby, this heart, you see it beats for you 
 But you take that for granted, the more I try, the less you hear 
 I just don't understand it 
 See, I would give you the world, the stars and all the planets 
 But every time we talk, you got your guard up, so I'm asking 
 'Should I even be mad at you?' 
 'Should I pack my shit up and leave, and never come back for you?' 
 All I wanted was time, was that too much to ask from you? 
 I know I made mistakes, I'm the first to admit 
 But why every time that we fight, you were the first one to split 
 Plus your friends, always up in your ear, see 
 You might be with me physically, but yo, you're not really here 
 I can tell I'm not who you thinking of anymore 
 I'll always love you, I'm just not in love anymore 
 I regret the things that I've done to you 
 But I just got too much pride to go run to you 
 I never stopped feeling the love for you 
 I just stopped being the one for you
