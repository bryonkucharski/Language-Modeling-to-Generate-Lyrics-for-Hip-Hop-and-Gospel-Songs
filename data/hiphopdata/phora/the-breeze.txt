Look homie I got that Cali state of mind, man, I never been a chump 
 I always had skill, y'all just got beginner's luck 
 My nigga's up in the valley, know how we do it, we rowdy 
 I walk up in the place and these niggas know I'm from Cali 
 You can tell by the way I talk and how my chucks laced up 
 Niggas lookin' mad like the they tryna shoot the place up 
 But y'all gots to chill with that drama, for real 
 'Cause I ain't tryin' to see somebody get killed 
 But like Devon said, there's always that one in the crowd talkin' loud 
 And jealousy and envy got 'em runnin' they mouth 
 Got one too many drinks in they system, they overdid it 
 So if you sip on a nigga make sure that you know your limit 
 And we could cruise down the Five on them August nights 
 Warm summer breeze, drivin' through them city lights 
 Gotta watch my back 'cause I hear some niggas after me 
 Yo, but ain't no other place I'd rather be, I'm rollin' with my 
 Windows down, breeze across my face 
 Nothing too fancy, man, it's not really my taste 
 But I'm always on the grind, twenty-four seven, man 
 And I ain't got the time for no bullshit, please don't bring it this way 
 Never had a problem with a nigga tryin' to get paid 
 'Cause we all gotta eat 
 But if you with the drama, get the fuck up off of me now 
 I said I'm on the plane to LAX comin' from Reno 
 Auntie told me to stay away from prostitutes and casinos 
 Once you fall into an addiction, it's hard to quit 
 And when you quit you lose everything that you started with 
 I spark then spit the truth and pass the joint, I get straight to the point 
 Yo, I'd die for this shit 'cause I ain't got no other choice 
 I'm asleep in the foray, I'm catchin' narcolepsy 
 Hopped up on the train just to see how far it gets me 
 Job won't let me come through the front door so I break through the back 
 Ain't nobody real as us and I'm just statin' a fact 
 Lacin' these tracks up, like a pair of new shoes 
 Sippin' on a Blue Moon, you know my steez, rest in peace Guru 
 Shine like the sun before it sets in the west 
 Left side but I'm reppin', check the ink in my flesh 
 But the gangs that rock Taylors never heard of Khalifa 
 But they rep the California, steady burnin' up refer like... 
 Windows down, breeze across my face 
 Nothing too fancy, man, it's not really my taste 
 But I'm always on the grind, twenty-four seven, man 
 And I ain't got the time for no bullshit, please don't bring it this way 
 Never had a problem with a nigga tryin' to get paid 
 'Cause we all gotta eat 
 But if you with the drama, get the fuck up off of me now
