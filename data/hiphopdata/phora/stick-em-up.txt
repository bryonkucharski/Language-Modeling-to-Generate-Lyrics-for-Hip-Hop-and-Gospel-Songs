Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, stick 'em up now 
 Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, stick 'em up, what 
 Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, stick 'em up, uh 
 Stick 'em up, yours truly motherfucka 
 Ah shit, y'all done let the dogs out 
 It's time to get some blood up on my paws now 
 Got a list of rappers that I plan to take under 
 But tell the truth 
 They'll probably fall off by the end of the summer 
 I got a lot shit planned for these niggas 
 We're killing 'em slowly, watching 'em suffer 
 I feel bad for these niggas 
 And I'm never far from ready, I ain't signed to Interscope 
 But I keep these rappers in my scope, my aim is always steady 
 Fuck rap, fuck a deal, since I came, I've been real 
 Stick 'em up then shut your mouth 
 Don't tell me how the fuck you feel 
 I don't give a fuck about the blogs or the magazines 
 I got a magazine of lyrical shots that'll smash your team 
 What would you do if I gave you my dick 
 You'd probably run and tell your friends after you give it a lick 
 I'm with this shit, so what is love, love 
 Is it you and I taking a five speed down the five 
 Doing ninety-five yelling "Do or die" 
 Who am I, the one you shouldn't fuck with 'cause it's suicide 
 All these niggas lies, they just old tricks with a new disguise 
 I made this shit possible for niggas like us 
 And nowadays they rush you and bust 
 So who the fuck can you trust 
 Yo, breaking the bank and we bringing it back 
 And I'm running my city like we on a track 
 And these niggas be talking, but never attacking 
 I'm taking the title, I'm spitting the facts 
 You niggas is whack and I'm letting you know 
 I got goons in the back and they ready to go 
 Give me the loot, give me the dough 
 Pass me the mic and I'm ready to roll 
 Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, stick 'em up now 
 Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, stick 'em up, what 
 Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, stick 'em up, uh 
 Stick 'em up, yours truly motherfucka 
 Fuck this rap shit 'cause I don't know where the passion is 
 Now I'm dumping heavy shit like rolling on some laxatives 
 Y'all the definition of what average is 
 You done stepped into the ring with some ma-fucking savages 
 I spit flames and manipulate the beat 
 I'm Rick James, I got mud up on my feet 
 I'm quick to stop these rappers, get your body fractured 
 I ain't like molly rappers, I don't like all these rappers 
 So I'm back with a vengeance, swinging off with the hinges 
 I take one for the team, now I'm back in the trenches 
 Strapped with a backpack, bring a rap back to the essence 
 Spitting penitentiary bars that come with a death sentence 
 See all irrelevant, that was past tense 
 I got Mayan blood with the heart of an Aztec 
 No label necessary, every verse is legendary 
 Now give me the loot, everything else is secondary 
 I'm second to none, spit like I'm a son of a pun 
 Cock back, wait a minute, I'm a son of a gun 
 Ain't no heaven in my future, I'm just being honest 
 Now just put your fucking hands up 
 Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, stick 'em up now 
 Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, stick 'em up, what 
 Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, stick 'em up, uh 
 Stick 'em up, yours truly motherfucka
