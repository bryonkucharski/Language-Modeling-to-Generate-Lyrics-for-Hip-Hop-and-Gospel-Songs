I'm everything they always said I can't be 
 They doubt me 'cause they don't understand me 
 This for my family, see? 
 I ain't forget about not one of you 
 Even though we far from the Huxtables 
 Home is where I feel comfortable 
 But I won't be gone too long, I'm traveling light 
 Sometimes you on your own up in this constant battle with life 
 So after your night when you rest your head 
 Hope you have time to pray for me 
 'Cause it could be gone in a flash 
 But I say that gracefully, grateful 
 Yeah I'm so thankful for the thing that I have 
 Been pushing myself so hard man I've been thinking so fast 
 It's like my life is moving at high speed 
 But I ain't slowing down simply 'cause that's just not me 
 I'm riding till the wheels fall off and the smoke in my engine 
 I got dreams of the world saying Phora's a legend 
 But for now I'm just being patient, doing what I do 
 Focused on the music saying me ain't nothing new 
 But yo this for my uncle Tom and auntie Linda 
 I've been away so long, least I could do is say I miss ya 
 Even though I ain't in the group pic, I ain't out the picture 
 I'm always there in spirit, I love y'all and I'm still with ya 
 I ain't forget ya 
 Ayo right now I'm just searching for myself 
 That's who I need to find before looking for someone else, you know? 
 Ayo that's probably why I'll never attach 
 That's probably why they leave, but when they go 
 They always come back, it's a fact 
 I know she wondering where I been, what I'm doing 
 But I'm just making this music, listen it's nothing to it 
 I know I slipped up a few times 
 Okay maybe a few times more than a few times 
 But still it's all gonna come together and do time 
 Follow your dreams, cause best believe I pursue mine 
 You'll do fine, don't worry 'bout it I got faith in ya 
 Special place in my heart, there's no replacing ya 
 Follow your dreams ain't no telling where they taking ya 
 Making that money, but that moneys never making ya 
 So if you ever need me, I'm just a call away 
 By your side all the way 
 Cherish the moment it could be gone today 
 Yeah, I'm just a call away, by your side all the way 
 Cherish the moment it could be gone today
