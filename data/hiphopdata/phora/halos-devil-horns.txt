Sometimes I feel like I got a halo over my devil horns 
 Not really knowing was worse or better for it 
 The world turns and over time I really learn 
 Never judge someone taking steps in shoes you've never worn 
 So why would they judge me? 
 Bet they couldn't walk a couple feet in my chucked T's 
 It's been rough for me since I ain't even had front teeth 
 Just a young buck bumping Pac and BIG 
 While I was saying Super Nintendo Sega Genesis 
 When I was 15, homie, I couldn't picture this 
 I was up in the hospital without a chance to live 
 God had plans for me, it's my chance to give 
 Back to the fans and the kids and the people tryna do good in life 
 All my homies pleading guilty, the case is they couldn't fight 
 Stay strong, be positive, keep yo head up 
 Instead of finding someone to wet up just keep yo bread up 
 Don't wrap yo hands around that Beretta, it's all a setup 
 I'm tryna spread the love, it's nothin' these cats can't tell us 
 I speak for my generation, watch me open these doors 
 Nas told me the world was mine, now I'mma show you it's yours 
 One love! 
 It was all a dream 
 Uh, damn right I like the life I live 
 'Cause I went from negative to positive 
 And it's all 
 And if you don't know 
 And if you don't know now you know, nigga 
 Yeah, I remember, getting kicked out of my pop's house 
 Sleepin' in my homie's Honda till I got locked out 
 And had no where to go tryna make dough to help moms out 
 Picked up my pen and pad and that's the second I dropped out 
 See, I done risked it all to follow a dream they said I couldn't reach 
 Spent the rest of my child hood running' on the streets 
 Nah it's ironic, they called me up last week 
 Saying' that teachers having trouble teaching they think 
 I should give a speech, haha 
 It's funny how that works, huh? 
 Funny I believe in God, but not the church, huh? 
 And it's funny how my demons get a hold of me 
 I don't need to read the Bible, I just need to write a verse, huh? 
 I done went through it all 
 Sippin' 40s, little shawties, taggin' up on the walls 
 All I really had was a heart of steel and my dirty chughs 
 Late nights in the city, taggin' like hurry up 
 We gotta catch the bus down beach boulevard 
 That was before my cousin started sneakin' out granny's car 
 Round the same time my heart first broke, that shit changed me 
 But help me see the difference between a trick and the lady 
 So watch for these cats that got they eyes on yo steps 
 They ain't holdin' you down then they just holdin' you back 
 I'm speakin' for this generation, watch me open these doors 
 Nas told me the world was mine, now I'mma show you it's yours 
 One love! 
 It was all a dream 
 Uh, damn right I like the life I live 
 'Cause I went from negative to positive 
 And it's all 
 And if you don't know 
 And if you don't know now you know, nigga 
 Yeah, this song was inspired by 
 The great words of the Notorious BIG, rest in peace 
 Yeah, 1,2, we still sip 40 ounces 
 And birthdays was the worst days 
 We still sip 40 ounces when we thirsty ain't shit changed 
 I just had to do that one time I just had to 
 Yeah we still sip 40 ounces when we thirsty ain't shit changed 
 No nigga ain't shit changed
