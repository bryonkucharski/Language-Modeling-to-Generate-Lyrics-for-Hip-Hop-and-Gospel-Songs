Yeah, baby girl I just wanna roll witchu 
 And if I'm feeling you, I just might smoke witchu 
 But at the homies studio, working right now 
 So I can't promise I'mma go home witchu 
 I got work to do, I got shit to do 
 Before I leave I wanna know what I is to you 
 What I mean to you, so can I sing to you 
 So get your ass up in the car, we got things to do 
 Things to do, tell me why I got this need for you 
 Talk to me, look straight through my soul 
 That's why I just can't be witchu 
 Be with you 
 'Cause I can't get attached 
 Spark to my flame, but we ain't really match 
 Girls throw me signs that I ain't tryna catch 
 So when I be at the spot man I stay at the back 
 Like way in the back with my chucks on 
 Get my I don't give a fuck on 
 Then I hear two girls on my left saying 
 "Ain't that the dude that made that love song?" 
 Shit I don't know what his name is 
 He dress like a bum, shit I thought he was famous 
 I know he got money though, I wonder what he drives me 
 These girls always talking about the color of his eyes 
 Crazy what some fame can do for a nigga 
 Back then a girl like you was off limits 
 Asked for her number, always get the wrong digits 
 But all of a sudden baby girl you wanna kick it 
 Life's funny like that, girls tryna play me for a dummy like that 
 'Cause everybody love you and everybody wanna be a friend 
 When you got a lil money like that 
 But guess what baby, I ain't got nothing for you 
 Yo yo she used to Hilary my jazz 
 Back when she had uncle Phil tripping on me 
 Couple years passed, heard I had a lil cash 
 Now you right here kissing on me 
 Funny how it changed for me 
 When I wanted, I couldn't get it 
 And now I'm fucking around, it came to me 
 And now you wanna claim me and cling to me 
 You ain't want me from the jump when this was all a dream to me 
 Why you frontin'? 
 Good pussy, can't hide that you ain't wanna ride 
 When a nigga had nothing 
 Yeah it's all in disguise, don't act that surprised 
 You know this ain't real, we just fucking 
 Feeling a hundred percent like Genuwine 
 I don't wanna talk, I wanna get it on 
 Well your titties were nice and tonight is the night 
 You can bring your home girls for a sing along 
 Yeah we being ratchet, sarcastic 
 But she told me if I want it I could have it 
 But you never Chance The Rapper 
 Before all the Acid Rap until you seen me established 
 Life's funny like that 
 I could tell back in the day lil mama didn't want me like that 
 But bitches will do anything 
 When they think that you got a lil money like that 
 Well guess what baby, I don't got a damn thing for you 
 See I'm running my city, my niggas they got me 
 I know what they thinking 
 We used to be on the brink of robbing a bank 
 And want all of us on a plane to a city, we get it popping 
 And what I'm about to say, yo I never thought I would say 
 But we on right now, yeah we on right now 
 Aye baby you should roll up to the spot right now 
 To the spot right now 
 Aye I'mma give it you you while it's hot right now 
 While it's hot right now 
 Only fucking with me 'cause I'm on top right now 
 But when it all falls down 
 Aye where will you be, where will you go 
 Aye you fucking with me, but let's keep that on the low
