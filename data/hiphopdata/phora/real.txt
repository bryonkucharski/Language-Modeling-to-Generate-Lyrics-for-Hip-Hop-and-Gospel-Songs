They say my time is coming soon 
 And they wanna take my life, but that ain't nothing new 
 I've been spit on, bleeding on the ground 
 Been kicked on, but if I'm going down motherfucker then you coming to 
 Lately I just don't know what to do 
 'Cause I hear these niggas talking, but they actions never coming through 
 So stop yapping on the net 
 I fear no man, but God so come and slice these tats up off my neck 
 And if y'all gangsters so tough 
 Then I don't know why y'all don't ever come to none of my shows 
 Close your mouth 
 It ain't to hard to catch me 
 I'm coming in your cites 
 But you'll probably just look pass me (Ha) 
 Real shit though I try to keep the peace 
 But it's difficult to keep when niggas always starting beef 
 Put your ears next to my soul 
 Tell me if you hear me 
 These are my last words before these motherfuckers kill me 
 Haha 
 Can you feel me? (nope) 
 No I'm not new to this I'm true to this (I'm true to this nigga) 
 You ain't really real I can tell when I look at you (I can tell when I look at you) 
 I'm authentic you artificial man (Artificial man) 
 Haha 
 Can you feel me? (Nah) 
 No I'm not new to this I'm true to this (I'm true to this nigga) 
 You ain't really real I can tell when I look at you 
 I'm authentic you artificial man 
 Nowadays everybody want to be real 
 Don't want to put in work, but they expect to eat a free meal 
 Lost faith 
 'Cause this worlds so fake 
 Had to leave my last chic 
 'Cause these girls is snakes and shit 
 I lost hope to finding a girl I trust 
 'Cause the last one I was with didn't really give a fuck 
 Since I ain't got nobody to talk with 
 These beats become therapy and help deal with the nonsense 
 And I can't wait to die (Huh) 
 'Cause when I'm gone they're gonna realize the reason why I came to life 
 Paste the skies with love 
 They let the fake shit rise above 
 And when I tell you that I'm real 
 No I ain't saying I'm a thug 
 And saying I'm a gangster 
 I'm just true to myself 
 'Cause in the end that's all that matters fuck the girls, fame, and wealth 
 So try to life my life then tell me if you feel me 
 These are my last words before these motherfuckers kill me
