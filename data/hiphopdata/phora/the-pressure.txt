Yeah, 6:35 in the morning 
 We in the studio talking about life 
 Where we think we going to be in 2 years 
 Having late night conversations and someone brought up the fact. 
 We can't take none of this shit when we leave the planet 
 So what's the purpose? 
 I've been thinking what's life really mean when it's all over? 
 I've been drinking too much, my mind been trying to stay sober 
 Lately I been stressing, all this pressure on my shoulders 
 I'm trying to get right with god, but I don't feel no closer 
 Every time I pray man, he never answers my questions 
 Man, starting to feel like life ain't no blessing 
 We ain't got no direction, cops killing us not protecting 
 Pops said if you rollin' round through these streets, carry you a weapon 
 So I went and got me a .38, but I probably ain't gon' use it 
 Really man, the only weapon that I need is this music 
 Never said I'm perfect, but homie I'm not stupid 
 Sometimes I feel worthless and sometimes I feel useless 
 But I ain't got no time for that now, I ain't got no patience 
 Runnin' round through these streets man, only end up in two places 
 Niggas got two faces, rich folk they all racist 
 Family comes first man 'cause those the ones that I came with 
 Yeah, they all know I ride for my people 
 Yeah, they all know I die for my people 
 They know the deal (deal) 
 All my niggas know it's real, it's real 
 Look, I was born in 9-4 
 Both middle fingers up 
 Niggas speak on how they feel, but really I could give a fuck 
 Young nigga trying to change the world 
 Some people show me love 
 Some people want to kill me 
 Some people want to go and set me up 
 But I been through way too much 
 So why the fuck would I stop now? 
 All the haters wanna talk now 
 Put the fists up, put the Glocks down 
 And I ride round. my city like 
 Everybody know. I done came so far, but still got a long way to go 
 Yeah, they all know I ride for my people 
 Yeah, they all know I die for my people 
 They know the deal (deal) 
 All my niggas know it's real, it's real
