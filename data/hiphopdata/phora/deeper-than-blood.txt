Sometimes pain runs deeper than blood 
 Sometimes karma comes back on the people you love 
 Sometimes we gotta let go and turn the other way 
 We just fightin' for another day 
 'Cause everything has a cause, you may not like the effect 
 A heart full of pain and a life full of regrets 
 Forced to make certain choices that you might not respect 
 In this world full of hate, just a child of neglect 
 He was breathin' in cigarette smoke, watching cartoons 
 Loud yells comin' from the other room 
 Landlord bangin' on the door askin' where the fuckin' rent at 
 'Cause it's 30 days overdue 
 Nobody answers it 
 They was smokin' up the house like they ain't know that shit was cancerous 
 But his mom is still tryna quit 
 She ain't got no one to depend on to provide for her kids 
 She's working 2 jobs 
 Barely makin' enough to fill his stomach 
 It's still filled with nothing 
 Hard times, she can feel 'em coming 
 And it's been that way for a while 
 She raisin' a fatherless child, you can see the pain in her smile 
 She got unpaid bills piling on up the counter 
 No matter how close to the edge she got, there was something about her 
 That never let her lose hope 
 Even when she hit rock bottom, she feels the noose around her neck 
 It's just a loose rope 
 But it's only getting tighter, suffocating her slowly 
 She's a lover and a fighter, but something just keeps her lonely 
 She got a collect call but she already know who it's from 
 She took a deep breath, answered the phone and begun 
 She said I gotta move on with my life, I told you it's done 
 Plus it's been 2 months since you spoke to your son 
 It's not about me and it's not about you anymore 
 It's not about running the streets and acting a fool anymore 
 You've been gone for 7 years, there's nothing you can do anymore 
 'Cause I've lost everything and I just can't bear to lose anymore 
 You see, there's somebody else 
 Not because I'm in love, but 'cause I needed some help 
 The type of help you can't provide 
 I'm sick of waiting 
 I'm sick of sittin' around knowing you might not make it out alive 
 Sick of not havin' someone by my side 
 Sick of our kids askin "where's our daddy?" 
 I'm sick of tellin' them these lies 
 I'm just sick of it all 
 And if you ever make parole and have plans for the future 
 Please don't get us involved 
 Don't call, don't write and most of all leave my child alone 
 And before he could say a word all he heard was a dial tone 
 As his mother put down the phone he heard her saying 
 "God, I need you right now, please just show me a sign 
 My heart is bleeding right now" 
 But he was only a kid, so he really didn't know much 
 Still tryna understand why his mother cried so much 
 Father's Day was the worst 
 Plus they ain't had no money in the bank 
 So it felt like every holiday was a curse 
 And his birthday just passed 
 He's getting ready for a lonely Christmas 
 They say his dad is gone for business 
 But he knows the difference 
 Starting to forget his father's face and what he looked like 
 No bedtime stories, no good mornings, no good night 
 Just a good luck from the judge, his life would change with a sentence 
 Slam the gavel down, he's found guilty of all the offenses 
 On the other side of the fence, left his child defenseless 
 Now he fends for himself, but he feels so relentless 
 His momma's boyfriend drinks until his demons come out 
 The liquor takes control of his soul, he don't speak with his mouth 
 He speaks with his fist, disagree get beat 'til your pissed 
 The type of pain that'll make you put a knife deep in your wrist 
 I said, 
 He speaks with his fist 
 The type of pain that'll make you put a knife deep in your wrist 
 Sometimes the choices you make, they don't only effect you 
 But they also effect the people you love and care about 
 You see, I wish I could say that it's never too late 
 But I would only be lying to you 
 Because time and the people we love 
 Are the only two things we can never get back in this world
