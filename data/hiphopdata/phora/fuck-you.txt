So fuck you, I'mma do it all myself 
 Never needed y'all for no help 
 You should watch them niggas around you 
 I can make it to the top with or without you 
 Look, I never had shit handed to me 
 I worked hard for this shit, your truly bitch, I started this shit 
 And that's until my fucking grave, I got it carved in my skin 
 They say the bigger the head, then the harder you slip 
 So I stay humble to the people who took part in this shit 
 And I swear on my mother's life, it's from the heart when I spit 
 Nah, I never told a fable man, these other dudes is fairy tales 
 Trust me, all the cats you hear dissing me I know very well 
 But fuck the rap beef, I'll never diss a nigga back 
 'Cause I got more important shit to cover in a track 
 Really half these niggas mad 'cause they can't get a feature from me 
 Trying to pay me for a verse, man you can keep your money 
 'Cause I keep my circle small and work with who I trust 
 Never will I give a handout for a couple bucks 
 Homie I don't give a fuck, call me what you want to 
 'Cause I've done heard it all, but never do y'all fall through 
 So fall back, I got a plan for myself 
 I went from nothing to something, never asked for no help 
 Look, so fall back, I got a plan for myself 
 I went from nothing to something, never asked for no help nigga 
 So fuck you, I'mma do it all myself 
 Never needed y'all for no help 
 You should watch them niggas around you 
 I can make it to the top with or without you 
 I won't stop till I'm immortalized, it's the Mexican oversize 
 Now the threat is organized, I got em' all mortified 
 Y'all shut to your stomach, the stocks gon' plummet 
 They say they run these streets 
 But their fucking mouths the only thing they running 
 They say I should praise the sun, I feel like Satan's son 
 It's the illuminated one, let the bud invade your lungs 
 These weed sessions got me stressing, kinda depressing 
 Now I'm getting these bars off my chest like I was bench pressing 
 On a mission, the clock is ticking, no time for politician 
 Tomorrow ain't guaranteed, so I'm just getting what I'm getting 
 Gotta formulate the plot, orchestrate the shots 
 Y'all better lick shots 'cause it's gon' take more to make me stop
