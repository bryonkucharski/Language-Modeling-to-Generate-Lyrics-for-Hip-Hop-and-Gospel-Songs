Well, I know what it's like to feel alone 
 I know what it's like to have the closest person to you gone 
 I see myself in you 
 I see myself in the man on the corner, told his story 
 All these things I never knew, but is it true? 
 That everybody needs somebody else 
 Don't you ever feel disgusted when you look at yourself 
 Like somethings wrong with ya 
 Shit and you just wanna change it 
 No matter whether you pretty, rich, broke or famous 
 We all got something to hide 
 We all got something inside of us that's gon be with us till we die 
 So get right with yourself or live stuck in a lie 
 I'm running from time, I'm running from time, shit 
 I don't wanna be rich, I just want enough to provide 
 For my family and every person that's stuck to my side 
 I'm wondering why, shit I've had enough of the lies 
 None of it feels real anymore, its just a mirage 
 Just a mirage, what's love if it doesn't last an eternity 
 And what's peace if they contemplating on burning me 
 And what's the purpose of living life in a struggle 
 Making mistakes, tryna make 'em right if my child doesn't learn from me 
 I know what it feels like 
 Yeah I know what it feels like to be all alone, all alone 
 She said they don't know what it feels like 
 They don't know what it feels like 
 That's where you're wrong, that's where you're wrong 
 'Cause I know 
 I met this girl, she thought the world was against her 
 She was going through a lot and her mama just left her 
 She told me, I ain't got nothing left 
 I got no choice but leaving this world 
 As you can see I had a seat with this girl 
 She told me, her man don't love her, her pops was never there 
 She'd been used her whole life, no one to wipe her tears 
 No guardian angel, she just washing her pain away with the bottle 
 Hoping that she doesn't make it tomorrow 
 She had an abortion 
 It left her mentally scared for the rest of her life 
 At the same time she felt it was right 
 Said she can't provide for a kid, she just some girl 
 She ain't wanna bring a child into this fucked up world 
 She tried to keep it on the low down 
 Only one she told was her best friend 
 That turned on her, the whole school knows now 
 Started getting angry saying what do I do 
 Where do I go, you don't feel my pain so how could you know 
 Shit I didn't know what to say, I was at a loss for words 
 Took a deep breath and I started to talk to her 
 Said words don't make you who you are, nah your actions do 
 Yeah I see 'em point their fingers, see 'em laugh at you 
 I see 'em glad that you walk around with your head down 
 Nobody next to you 
 Just remember there's nothing you have to prove 
 Nothing you have to do to make them see you different kid 
 'Cause they don't see the truth behind them eyes that you was gifted with 
 Trust me, even when you feel alone, you really not I promise you 
 But sometimes all you really got is you 
 Well shit, that's really all you need 
 See I see myself in you, I hope you find yourself through me 
 One love
