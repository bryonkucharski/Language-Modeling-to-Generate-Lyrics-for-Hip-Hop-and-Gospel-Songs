Baby you should come through, I gotta party for two 
 Relax, recline and tell me what you want me to do 
 You got twenty-five missed calls and all of em' dudes 
 But all these niggas really do is make it harder for you 
 'Cause you know you got everything a man needs 
 Everything he wants, you're like the girl in every man's dreams 
 So tell me how you ended up with me 
 'Cause if your pops saw us together, he probably wouldn't agree 
 But I mean, the Hennessy got me feeling some type of way about you 
 When I see you, I just don't know what to say about you 
 'Cause I see you got your head did, nails done 
 Angel in the skies, it's like heaven is where you fell from 
 But you just came from the liquor store with a bottle for me 
 Love it when you get your Marilyn on and your model for me 
 You whisper to me you never down with no sucker 
 You got the mind of a hustler, baby girl you must've got it from me 
 Tell me I own it, tell me it's all me 
 Tell me you fell in love the very second that you saw me 
 Look, tell me you need me and you want me all alone 
 'Cause there ain't nothing wrong with getting in my zone right now 
 Just feel that Cali breeze blowing all through your aura 
 Love how you see the difference between Marco and Phora 
 'Cause not many of em' do, see you deserve it all 
 But you ain't worried 'bout no dope 'cause you got plenty of it too 
 So what's up, we should take a plane trip to the islands 
 It'll be good for once, won't have to go sleep to some sirens 
 'Cause I've been stressing out lately, I know you could tell 
 'Cause to tell the truth, without you I've been going through hell 
 So what's the deal shit, we could probably make us a mill 
 On some Bonnie and Clyde shit, just let me know how you feel 
 For real, you so elegant, smooth to the touch 
 I bet everybody wish that they was us 
 So what's up, you gon' be here throughout my ups and my downs 
 And if they kick me to the ground, would you still be around 
 Won't say you ain't gotta worry about a thing no more 
 'Cause what good is the sunshine if that rain don't pour 
 Tell me I own it, tell me it's all me 
 Tell me you fell in love the very second that you saw me 
 Look, tell me you need me and you want me all alone 
 'Cause there ain't nothing wrong with getting in my zone right now
