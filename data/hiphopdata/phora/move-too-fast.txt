(Hook: Phora) 
 Move too fast 
 Yeah, I know I probably move way too fast 
 Yeah, I know I probably move too fast 
 Yeah, I know I probably move way too fast 
 But truth is, I would've waited for you 
 Don't let this get to your head 
 But no girl could ever take me from you 
 And all my friends say I'm stuck on you 
 See, I hate to love you 
 Yeah, see, I just move too fast 
 So I couldn't end up staying for you 
 They say, "The only way to know that love is real is when you hate each other" 
 They say, "The only way to know that love is real is when you hate each other" 
 Yeah, see, I just move too fast 
 So I couldn't end up staying for you 
 (Verse: Phora) 
 I know I move too fast 
 Couldn't have a future with you when you stuck in the past 
 It's like, you let go, I started getting attached 
 I put you first, you said I'm just like your last, damn 
 That's when I start think to myself "Did you even care? 
 Or was I lost looking for a love that wasn't there?" 
 In a world full of snakes, I was real to you 
 You'll never know how I feel for you, I'd kill for you 
 But I was your cure, you were my disease 
 I was saving you, but you were killing me 
 I seen a person in you that you couldn't see 
 But you just wanted me to be someone I couldn't be 
 Well love is like a rose, flawless to the eyes 
 Beautiful at first, but eventually it dies 
 Truth brings pain, but that's beauty in the lies 
 So I'd rather be lied to than feel this emptiness inside 
 Had to subtract my ex's, you the one in my equation 
 But why you let 'em divide us over something they were saying? 
 I don't get it love, you push away, but say you miss my love 
 Gave you all I had, made me feel like I ain't give enough 
 Said you'd never quit on me, but now you giving up 
 See, I would die for you, but you can't even live for us 
 So, now we pretend like we don't exist 
 But we both know it wasn't supposed to end like this 
 I know I...
