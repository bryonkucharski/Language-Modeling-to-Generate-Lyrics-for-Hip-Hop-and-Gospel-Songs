Visions of me and my peeps at the top 
 Nothing came easy, we needed a plot 
 And they said they'd doubt we'd ever make it 
 But that's the very same reason we fought 
 So close to giving up on life, I wanted to quit 
 Like why keep going if they don't know you exist? 
 But the fans helped me down like no other 
 So I hope that you get everything that you ever dreamed of 
 'Cause I know it's a bitch 
 Yeah, this thing we call life 
 But y'all are helping me make it through 
 All I dream of is my music doing the same for you 
 But tell me, where's God when you need him? 
 Why does it only feel like the Devil is present 
 When my mind is tempted by my demons 
 Shit, I guess this is all a part of his plan 
 But it's hard to keep my faith when everyone says that you hardly a man 
 Even though you taking care of your fam 
 Even though you put all your dreams on the line 
 And gave them all that you can 
 I give my life for them, would they do the same for me? 
 It got me thinkin' if the shit they said was make believe 
 'Cause it just seems like all they ever do is take and leave 
 And leave me in the dust, without a place to be 
 People lookin' in from the outside, they don't know what you feelin' 
 My worlds caving in, I'm suffocating 
 Crushed by the ceiling, the walls are closing in 
 And 4 years back, if you asked anyone about Marco 
 They just say I lost hope in him 
 Well I ain't even have hope in myself 
 And they keep saying they feel me, but they don't know how I felt 
 When I was on the ground dying, screaming just for someone to help 
 But no one came, I had to comfort myself 
 Going through a pain, I just couldn't take 
 I might much rather die, it gets to me every time 
 I ain't even tell my mother goodbye 
 These niggas try to kill me, like really these niggas tried 
 So it must mean that there's a reason I'm breathing and still alive 
 And I don't want revenge 
 I want the niggas to see me thrive 
 And live my dreams and watch me change the world 
 And one day realize that they can do it too 
 They just need someone to open their eyes 
 'Cause I ain't got no hate In my heart for not one of these guys 
 'Cause all these cats wanna be gangsta, and I just wanna be me 
 Just wanna be free from the world and shit that's all on TV 
 Seems like I'm dodging all my incoming calls, ain't replying to texts 
 Man I'm just tryna get away from it all 
 And Moms deserves a new house, but I just can't afford it 
 Feel like I got the perfect song but I just can't record it 
 If this was my last song, how long would it last? 
 See, I know I've fucked up but now that's all in the past 
 'Cause everything could be gone in a flash 
 So watch me pave the way and have a team of leaders follow my path 
 And I bet my teachers couldn't name a day they saw me in class 
 Fuck around, and have me speak to your students, watch all of them pass 
 You ain't succeed till you fall on your ass 
 'Cause shit, we fell way too many times to count, now all of us laugh 
 But they say men cry too 
 Every teardrop from my eye, I ask myself 
 What have you done good for besides you? 
 I'm still a kid so I still make mistakes 
 I just wanna live, before the good times fade away now 
 Before the good times fade away now 
 And where is everyone I used call my friend? 
 I've been so lost inside myself, I guess I lost my touch within' 
 I mean, I don't blame them, I got too much on my mind 
 Trust issues from the past, but I wish I could press rewind 
 And take it all back 
 Fuck rap, fuck the media, fuck the news, the internet 
 And all these fuckin' lies they feeding ya' 
 Fuck apologies, 'cause everything I did, it happened for a purpose 
 And fuck 'em if they ever said you worthless 
 So, fuck my anxiety, fuck my depression 
 I just can't figure out the reason why the fuck I've been stressin' 
 And fuck trying to love someone who just don't seem to love you back 
 'Cause we all deserve someone to be there when we feel trapped 
 Or lost and confused, we all got something to prove 
 But I just can't stand the thought of losing someone like you 
 Fuck stressing on the people that put you down for no reason 
 Fuck the ones who said they didn't believe 
 In everything that you said you would do 
 And now that its done, they start to come running 
 Fuck drinking to the point that you feel nothing 
 Fuck the rumors, fuck the gossip, dog, fuck they assumptions 
 Fuck the ones that said they had your back when they knew they was frontin' 
 And fuck every doubt that they had against you 
 They was clowin' on you, you thought they was clowin' with you 
 But it's all good 
 Shit, I guess it's all a part of his plan 
 'Cause everything they said I'd never be, is all that I am 
 Yours truly 
 Dear Lord, please bless us with the strength 
 To make it through these hard times and when we can't find our way 
 Please let your light be our guidance 
 And if anyone shall be looking down on another person 
 May they only be our loved ones looking down on us from the heavens 
 And may you bless us with the courage to be ourselves 
 Rather then fool ourselves the start of a new legacy 
 In Jesus name I pray, Amen
