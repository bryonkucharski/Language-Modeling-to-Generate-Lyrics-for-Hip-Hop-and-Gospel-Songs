Ayo, I used to wanna be the toughest kid on the block 
 Till I found out the toughest kid always gets shot 
 I used to wanna make a mill pushin' that rock 
 Till I found out the big timers always got caught 
 I used to wanna be the OG tellin' a tale 
 Till I found out they only up dead or in jail 
 I was lost and confused searchin' for somebody to be 
 Till I realized that person I was searchin' for was me 
 Look, as of right now I'm writing rhymes in this notebook 
 Scheming on making ways to make a mil, without giving my soul up 
 And split it with the cats that had nothing but love to show us 
 In hopes that I never have to watch my nigga bag that coke up 
 Just to make a buck to put some food in his belly 
 I ain't worried about the rumors or the bullshit they tell me 
 'Cause me and my niggas, yeah we tryna eat 
 We tryna get that, never sleep and never sit back 
 Talk is cheap so quit the chit chat 
 If you ain't got the flow you gotta go 
 If you and I suppose 
 You're gonna need a thousand up front for me to rock a show nigga 
 Tellin' you I'm bout my busy 
 I'm learnin' to forgive all the dirt that everyone's did me 
 Simply 'cause I'm just tryna learn to love before they kill me 
 I don't do this for myself, this for everyone that's with me 
 I just wanna be remembered when my time is up 
 Not as a G, not as a thug, 'cause homie I ain't tough 
 Just remember me for everything I tried to tell you 
 'Cause when I'm gone it'll make sense but I don't wanna fail you 
 So I try my best to try and stay alive 
 But it's hard when the cats that wanna take your life 
 Know where your family resides 
 Mama tells me stay inside, but I fear no man but god 
 So I'm out every day and night 
 I show up in my enemy's city, tasting my faith 
 Hoping I don't lose my life so I bow my head and I pray 
 'Cause if my time comes then it was meant to come 
 But when everything said and done 
 All I ask of you is don't forget the love 
 I used to wanna be the toughest kid on the block 
 Till I found out the toughest kid always gets shot 
 I used to wanna make a mill pushin' that rock 
 Till I found out the big timers always got caught 
 I used to wanna be the OG tellin' a tale 
 Till I found out they only up dead or in jail 
 I was lost and confused searchin' for somebody to be 
 Till I realized that person I was searchin' for was me
