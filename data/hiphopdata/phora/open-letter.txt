I had to do this for my city once 
 This for my Anaheim niggas rolling blunts 
 And I can't forget Santa Ana 
 'Cause it not about where I'm at 
 It was always about where I'm from 
 From a place where they quick to snatch your life 
 Put your feet in my shoes and you couldn't last a night 
 These rappers are rapping like claiming savage life 
 But me, I know the difference in real life and rapper's life 
 Why team and a team is back and strong 
 They thought they was killing it, that ain't last for long 
 These rappers talk guns and these kids rap along 
 Stop lying, you ain't in the dope house, you at your moms 
 That's not the boy she raised, how dare you disrespect her 
 Swear I feed off these niggas like I was Mr. Lecter 
 Watch my words eat away at their ego's 
 'Cause you can have all goons in the world 
 And they can't protect ya 
 You live a fraudulent life, you was never real 
 I'm dropping that fire just like I said I will 
 To the rappers that keep it real, man I see you 
 But you need to come to Yours Truly records for a better deal 
 So fuck what they say and homie I got enough 
 Now I ain't tripping, now listen I'm quit to call your bluff 
 And I'm killing these rappers, it's all for fun 
 'Cause I don't hate not a soul in this world 
 Except for Donald Trump 
 Keep the hate mail coming, that shit just motivates me 
 The thought of me making it probably drives you crazy 
 I'm hitting one-eighty, how can you blame me? 
 And I always keep a smile 'cause even a bullet couldn't take me 
 They the type to follow, bitch I break the rules 
 Boy you know you ain't no thug, you should've stayed In school 
 I guess I'm the one to break the news 
 You need to spend less time on Worldstar 
 And more time making moves 
 I ain't got shit to prove to a fucking soul 
 Middle finger to the world, watch me fuck her slow 
 Sitting here like what the fuck happened to rap? 
 Man, it used to be music 
 But now its just a muhfucking puppet show 
 It's gon' be a minute before we finish nigga 
 You telling stories, not living it, there's a difference nigga 
 Most of these rappers whole lives is rented 
 Why you say in a Bentley when you really in a Civic nigga? 
 Yeah, I could tell, I could tell when they fronting 
 Yours Truly, ask around, they gon' tell you we coming 
 And I tried to tell 'em not to push my buttons 
 Now we taking over, no room for discussion 
 Muhfucker what's up
