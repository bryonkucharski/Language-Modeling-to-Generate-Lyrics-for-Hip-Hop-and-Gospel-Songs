Baby you're beautiful 
 Don't ever let these fuckers tell you you're not 
 And keep it going when they tell you to stop 
 Just an angel with broken wings 
 The girl inside my dreams 
 Heaven must not be that far away 
 Because you fell from the top 
 You fell and you fought 
 Why you stressed out about how you looking love 
 Walking around your city, still feel like you ain't good enough 
 Why since you've been on my mind I can't stop thinking 'bout your voice 
 Your smile your lips and your eyes 
 Don't need to lie see I'm tryna get a grip 
 On you mind these other guys just tryna quick grip on your thigh 
 Sick of the lies I know your last man 
 He just didn't show you the real you 
 I see your soul your energy 
 I can connect they feel you I mean feel 
 The spiritual sense way pass the physical 
 Your body don't need to be perfect 
 For me to be into you I'm into you 
 I wanna show you my feeling that fit to you 
 Deep conversations you need someone to listen too 
 Someone who opens up at the same time pays attention 
 To every word you say and understand how the things have been for you 
 Some people really got the word beautiful twisted 
 See it's not your clothes body or lipstick that's materialistic 
 Beauty runs deeper than skin 
 Pass what the guys can see 
 Deep inside your soul what TV want you to be try to be 
 Like the skinny models in the magazines 
 That doesn't flatter me 
 'Cause what inside you matters 
 See baby you took a hundred pictures wasn't happy with one you 
 Tried one hundred jeans you wasn't happy with none 
 If you seen yourself through my eyes 
 Only then will you realize 
 Beauty isn't what you look like is but it's who you become 
 I said you took a hundred pictures wasn't happy with one 
 You tried on a hundred jeans wasn't happy with none 
 But if you see through my eyes 'cause only then will you realize 
 Beauty isn't what you look like it's who you've become 
 (They say beauty is in the eyes of the beholder 
 But sometimes the heart can see what invisible to the eye 
 You see everything on the outside is temporary 
 The looks, the appearance the makeup 
 It's the beauty on the inside that truly lasts forever) 
 Your flaws are what makes you perfect 
 Love every inch in your body head to your toe 
 Why when I look at you you get nervous self conscious 
 About the way you look but girl you should know 
 That your eyes are beautiful your smile is beautiful 
 You can hold conversations babe your mind is beautiful 
 Know what you're worth there's no one you need a prove it too 
 And know what I mean when I say you're far from the usual 
 I appreciate every single flaw in your body but they ain't flaws to me 
 That's what makes you special I told the world so they can all see 
 The stretch marks the split end don't mean you ain't fine 
 The crook it teeth that smile doesn't mean it don't shine 
 Listen I know it's hard to be different 
 But must me hard not to be like these other girls 
 But you gifted see I heard you wanted surgery 
 But baby just listen 
 All those things you feel you don't have ain't really missing 
 They just ain't meant to be don't need to fix what they broken 
 God made you perfectly like the skies and the oceans 
 Like the stars and the sunsets and the clouds and they skies 
 Couldn't name a thing I would change about you baby no lie 
 Why you looking on Instagram at these models stop comparing yourself 
 'Cause there's only one you in this world don't be scared of yourself 
 And your face is covered in make up but you tryna hide 
 I know it's hard to live with yourself when you're dying inside 
 But stop looking at yourself in the mirror picking your flaws out 
 A million beautiful things about you I'll point them all out 
 But I was guilty about not loving yourself too till I meet 
 You baby you took a hundred pictures wasn't happy with one 
 You tried on a hundred jeans wasn't happy with none 
 If you see yourself through my eyes only then will you realize 
 Beauty isn't what you look like it's who you become 
 I said you took a hundred pictures wasn't happy with one 
 You tried on a hundred jeans wasn't happy with none 
 If you seen yourself through my eyes 
 Only then will you realize 
 Beauty isn't what you look like bit it's who you become
