She don't need a man dawg, all she need is company 
 Acting like she don't wanna fuck with me 
 And she hit me up when I least expect that shit 
 Now she over here asking what's up with me 
 I told her same old thang, same old thang 
 But I can't chase no broads and play no games 
 'Cause all I know is that I can't be the one for you 
 Be there when you're lonely girl 'cause all you do is use these niggas 
 And she bad, but she ain't no good for me 
 I love when you say you got a thing for the boy 
 But I hate when you give that look to me 
 'Cause I know, baby I know what you're saying without even saying it 
 This feelin' you feeling now 
 Girl their ain't no replacing it 
 So show me it's real 
 Trust no soul 
 Yeah I know how your feel 
 You ain't no good, but I need your ass so bad 
 Shit, I just hope that it's real 
 I guess it's just the way that we are 
 We run so hard but we don't get far 
 I'm broken but you're the one that can piece me together 
 But we know we ain't ours 
 We ain't ours 
 I know you hope that it's real. But what's real ain't paying 
 I can't be the one for you 
 But I'll still come through 'cause my love ain't patient 
 See I can't go back to that thinking 
 'Cause that's the thinking that got me fucked up and needing ya 
 How come it's easy to be what I am 
 Than tell you what is on my chest, but all I can 
 Say is, you and I are on the same page 
 In the same book, got a different face 
 It don't make sense, but you'll understand 
 Do you have a good intention or another bad vibe 
 You are not a bad guy, just got a little bad side 
 Try to see from my eyes 
 You just want me for the idea 
 And even though I'm everything that you fear 
 You can do the math and see a dime's cheap 
 You'll still wanna buy her everything dear 
 Maybe it's a stretch but you got that thing about you 
 Pain is the thing that I see around you 
 Knowing what the price of this here is 
 I don't wanna chance what I got to appear I found it 
 Lost into you and I'm down for a change 
 But it's hard to be all for only you 
 I'm out for mine and you out for me 
 We all we got and gotta lose 
 I guess it's just the way that we are 
 We run so hard but we don't get far 
 I'm broken but you're the one that can piece me together 
 But we know we ain't ours 
 We ain't ours 
 She don't need a man dawg, all she need is company 
 Acting like she don't wanna fuck with me 
 And she hit me up when I least expect that shit 
 Now she over here asking what's up with me 
 I told her same old thang, same old thang 
 But I can't chase no broads and play no games 
 'Cause all I know is that I can't be the one for you 
 Be there when you're lonely girl 'cause all you do is use these niggas 
 And she bad, but she ain't no good for me
