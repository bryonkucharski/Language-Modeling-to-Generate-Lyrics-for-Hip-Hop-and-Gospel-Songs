This track right here, is for the one 
 Not the ones that think they the ones 
 But this is for the one, that knows she's the one 
 And those ones that think they the one 
 Might think this the one about the one 
 But this is the one about the one that knows she's the one 
 Authenticity lives deep within the words 
 Dreamin' of the sky, and she's sleeping with the birds 
 And when she wakes up, she's prettier than ever, 
 She don't ever need no make-up 
 Every single night we conversate 
 And we stay up 6 hours talking on the phone 
 It assures me when I look into your eyes I'm not alone 
 She's ain't trippin' on no Facebook statues, or which girl that is 
 She trust me and I never ever dare to take advantage 
 Grab me by my hand and she asked me if I knew Spanish 
 And I told her Si, poquito mi amor. I'm not your average 
 Not just my lover, you're my best friend 
 My pride and joy and I will never treat you less than 
 We both got a past but don't let it ruin our future 
 That beautiful voice is something I'm willing to get used to 
 I mean, I ain't the type to have theses girls on the side 
 Better yet, I'm the type to keep that girl by my side 
 She said "I love you to the moon and back" 
 And I replied, with a smile, "I love you too, in fact." 
 I have trust in me and you, baby don't ruin that 
 So, if I gave you my heart what would you do with that? 
 She said "I love you to the moon and back" 
 And I replied, with a smile, "I love you too, in fact." 
 I have trust in me and you, baby don't ruin that 
 So, if I gave you my heart what would you do with that? 
 What would you do if I gave you my heart? 
 Would you treat it with care or would you break it apart? 
 And I know you got your guard up, you're just playing it smart 
 'Cause you dealt with to many niggas just playing apart 
 I appreciate all the times you were there for me 
 Every time I stressed out and we talked it's like therapy 
 You take the pain away with nothing but a sentence 
 So I'm wishing that this conversation's endless 
 But if not, let's make it last 
 Even when it's hard to smile you make me laugh 
 Every time I fucked up, you had the love to take me back 
 Look, I know it's crazy but I think you're the one 
 Got me thinking commitment, even raising a son hah 
 You know I'm playing wit you girl, don't get excited 
 I mean any thing's possible just depends on the timing 
 So tell me when you're ready girl, I'll wait 'til the start 
 And think about what you would do if I gave you my heart 
 She said "I love you to the moon and back" 
 And I replied, with a smile, "I love you too, in fact." 
 I have trust in me and you, baby don't ruin that 
 So, if I gave you my heart what would you do with that? 
 She said "I love you to the moon and back" 
 And I replied, with a smile, "I love you too, in fact." 
 I have trust in me and you, baby don't ruin that 
 So, if I gave you my heart what would you do with that?
