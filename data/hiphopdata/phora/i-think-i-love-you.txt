Roses are red and violets are blue 
 Why does every love song remind me of you? 
 Why can't I make my mind up and decide what to do 
 I'm trying to write these songs 
 I always end up writing about you 
 I hope that you don't mind, sometimes I think about you 
 And I wish I could press rewind 
 Whisper in my ear, she send chills down my spine 
 Some people travel across the world and still don't ever find 
 This thing we call love, angel in my eyes 
 Like you were send from up above 
 (Like you were send from up above) 
 Look, see I catch myself staring I hope you don't mind 
 Baby I'm just taking time to thank god that you mine 
 So anytime you need I'll come through 
 Nothing comes between us it's just me it's just you 
 I never knew that love was so true 
 And if I have to tell the truth, girl 
 I've never been in love before you 
 Baby I'm the one for you 
 And that's for real 
 Never been in love 
 I never got to feel 
 Certain type of love you give to me 
 Trust you give to me 
 This is just the way I feel 
 Baby I'm the one for you 
 And that's for real 
 Never been in love 
 I never got to feel 
 Certain type of love you give to me 
 Trust you give to me 
 This is just the way I feel 
 I think I love you 
 I think I love you 
 I think I love you 
 I think I love you 
 Look 
 You remind me of summertime and 
 Ice cones, sunshine, beach waves, night shows 
 Love songs, you the reason why I write those 
 You the reason why the heart emoji's in my iPhone 
 Every king need a queen 
 I swear that you the girl I used to see in my dreams 
 Back then love was never my thing 
 See I think I love you I just don't know if I know what it means 
 But, you take me to a place where I've never been 
 Let your guard down, you can let me in 
 When I'm feeling low you are my medicine 
 Make love till I give yo ass a set of twins 
 I hope it never ends, your loyalty never breaks it never bends 
 It only feels right, so fuck stayin' the night 
 Baby you should go pack yo bags 
 Come settle in 
 Baby I'm the one for you 
 And that's for real 
 Never been in love 
 I never got to feel 
 Certain type of love you give to me 
 Trust you give to me 
 This is just the way I feel 
 Baby I'm the one for you 
 And that's for real 
 Never been in love 
 I never got to feel 
 Certain type of love you give to me 
 Trust you give to me 
 This is just the way I feel 
 I think I love you 
 I think I love you 
 I think I love you 
 I think I love you
