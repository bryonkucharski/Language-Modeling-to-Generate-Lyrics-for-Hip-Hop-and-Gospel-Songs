I love you like you'll never know 
 I know we had our differences, but girl it's time to let it go 
 'Cause right now is when I need you the most 
 Things ain't always what they seem until you see em' up close 
 So can you see it? 
 If I said you were the one, would you believe it? 
 If I told you love is pain, would that be something you'd agree with? 
 Just leave it and see where life takes us 
 I know you've heard a lot of shit 
 But I promised it, no one's gonna break us 
 Lying on the ground, looking at the stars above 
 Wondering if the angels are looking down on us 
 It got me wondering if Lalo can see me 
 'Cause if he could, he'd probably be proud of me, life isn't easy 
 I know it, especially when your loved one's coming and going 
 I'm having trouble with my feelings, can't show no emotions 
 Gave em' everything I had, you can call it devotion 
 Did this for my people and my family, I hope that they notice 
 Yeah, but as time keeps passing 
 Everything changes, that's the way things happen 
 I used to hate that I loved you so much 
 'Cause when I felt like giving up 
 In my mind you were stuck 
 Stuck in my mind, shit I just couldn't leave you behind 
 Till I realized that all I really needed was time 
 'Cause time heals everything, even broken hearts 
 Run my fingers through your hair, till you kiss me in the dark 
 Form my hands around your waist, tell you everything's okay 
 Listen, all I need is you girl, so tell me that you'll stay 
 In touch with the soul, intact with the spirit 
 I wrote this song for you, I just hope that you hear it 
 But if not, at least I know I tried 
 Throw my ashes in the ocean, feel my spirit in the sky 
 Sometimes I sit alone, all alone and wonder why 
 Why life is such a motherfucking bitch and then you die 
 Well, shit I guess nothing's guaranteed in life 
 I just hope you think of me before you sleep at night 
 I'm depressed, the doctor just says I ain't eating right 
 But I feel like it's something more than that 
 'Cause it hurts to know that Brian has cancer 
 'Cause that's what my grandpa died from 
 So many questions with no answers 
 Guess these are the things you just can't hide from 
 But I don't wanna hide no more 
 I don't wanna be shy when I look into your eyes no more 
 I don't want nobody else 'cause baby I'm all yours 
 And I'mma let it be known from CA to the 904 
 Everyone needs someone, no one wants to be forgotten 
 'Cause we all need someone to talk with 
 Someone that we can share our thoughts with 
 2 AM cartoons, Rice Krispies and hot chocolate 
 What I'm tryna say is that somebody for me is you 
 It was our destiny to meet, I know you see it too 
 But as time keeps ticking away 
 I love you like you'll never know until the end of my days 
 Yours Truly 
 I feel your heart becoming close 
 I love you like you'll never know 
 I feel your heart becoming so close 
 I love you like you'll never know 
 As time is passing by 
 I sit alone and wonder why 
 I sit alone and wonder why
