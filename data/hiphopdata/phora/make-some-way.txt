Yeah, they gonna see the outcome 
 Count my blessings every time I have one 
 It never comes easy when you lazy on the subject 
 Wait a sec, why for? 
 Better yet, ready for the mic check 
 Fuck 'em, never break a sweat. 
 Pay my gas, pay my dues 
 No matter what, I'm stayin' true 
 Never far from nonsense 'cause momma didn't raise a fool 
 Gotta keep it movin', I ain't with that bullshit 
 Don't talk about it, I do it 
 Take action and seek improvement 
 So follow my footsteps to the state of relevance 
 Only place that's making sense, speaking from experience 
 Point at blank paper, yeah I'm tired of it all 
 Tryin' to paint a picture when you don't know how to draw. 
 Yo, I do this for my family, I do this for my folks 
 I do this for the cats who used to take me as a joke 
 The ones that doubted me and said that I'd never amount to nothing 
 And even though they hate, I'm still brought up in their discussions 
 All the sudden get the time of day, last time I felt the hate 
 Appreciate, you never did, so I stay devilish 
 Insecure, you never know for sure 
 With this shit I endure, always leavin' me, mature 
 Yo, nothin' but love in my heart for the cats who feel my struggle 
 'Cause sending drugs and doin' deals don't really mean you hustle 
 Nah, 'cause it ain't hard to sell dope to a fiend 
 That ain't respect, you should try reaching your goals and your dreams 
 'Cause I'm thicked skin, shoot opinions down, like you gotta be 
 Not losin' sleep over lowlife fuckery 
 Social suicide with these Geminis 
 See you on the rise and do nothin' but despise 
 And you gotta watch for them snakes kid 
 Trust isn't common 'round as every other hate is 
 And they quick to end your life over some lunch money 
 And everyone's hungry, we all gotta eat 
 But ain't enough food for all of our tummies so 
 And it can't stop, and it won't stop 
 And it don't stop till we make your body rock 
 Here we get down, never listen to what the haters say 
 And when you see us comin' better make some way 
 And it won't stop, and it don't stop till we make your body rock 
 Here we get down, never listen to what the haters say 
 And when you see us comin' better make some way 
 And your bad habits, it goes without saying 
 You don't understand, then you don't know what you missin' 
 Sucked in like a gold mind, belief is hard to find 
 Read between the lines, so get left behind 
 Yo, after all's said and done, I stay true to my people 
 Never follow they rules 'cause these fools can deceive you 
 Look, I'll never ride with the niggas I didn't walk with 
 I'll never eat with the people I didn't starve with 
 On the high pedestal, but you so minuscule 
 Tryin' to be the best but you lackin' the pole 
 Yeah, back at square run when I hit the home run 
 Left you in the dirt, 'cause that's what you deserve 
 And homie, I ain't with the BS, I just wanna live drama-free 
 But every now and then I hear the devil calling me, temptin' the innocent 
 They say we all human, but karma is a bitch 
 And she don't like hearing excuses, nigga 
 And it can't stop, and it won't stop 
 And it don't stop till we make your body rock 
 Here we get down, never listen to what the haters say 
 And when you see us comin' better make some way 
 And it won't stop, and it don't stop till we make your body rock 
 Here we get down, never listen to what the haters say 
 And when you see us comin' better make some way
