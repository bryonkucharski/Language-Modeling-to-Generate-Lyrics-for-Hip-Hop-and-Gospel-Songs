Where the fuck were you when the teams feeling low? 
 No money in our pockets, ain't nobody at our show 
 Where the fuck were you when they all shut us down? 
 Us against the world you was no where to be found 
 Where the fuck were you dawg? where the fuck were you? 
 Where the fuck were you man? where the fuck were you 
 Now they show us love when we step up in this place 
 Like fuck 'em if they hating middle finger to your face!

 Now they show us respect but its way overdue 
 Through all this shit we stayed true but where the fuck were you? 
 Where the fuck were you? 
 (This is for anyone who's ever been told they couldn't. 
 Anyone who's ever been told they never would. 
 The choice isn't up to them, its up to you.) 
 It was all I ever had, to them it was none but a dream 
 Felt like my voice was never heard, 
 Felt like my work was never seen 
 Felt like my skill was overlooked, 
 Felt like my heart was meant to break 
 Felt like my plan was meant to fail and my whole damn life was a mistake 
 But I kept on pushing till I broke 
 Got my ass back up and tried again 
 Then I lost my sanity and hope 
 Right before I lost all my friends and I felt my time was coming close 
 Shit, I ain't had nun left 
 But I never gave up on myself keep going till my very last breath 
 And no matter how hard I tried to show 'em they would never understand 
 See I'm working on myself dawg, I'm tryna better who I am 
 See I had a vision no one else could see and ain't nobody else believe 
 Put my blood, sweat, my tears in this 
 Now everybody want a piece 
 But I'm like fuck that 
 Fuck that, hold up nigga fuck that 
 Now we living life and we eating dawg you wanna come around? 
 I don't trust that 
 Shout out to my niggas that stuck around 
 That N.O. DUB and that YT that be coming up from the underground 
 Man I could've swore I told y'all niggas 
 I could've swore I showed y'all niggas all my music 
 You ain't give no fucks haha 
 You was just like so what? Now you say you wanna roll but 
 Where the fuck were you when the teams feeling low? 
 No money in our pockets, ain't nobody at our show 
 Where the fuck were you when they all shut us down? 
 Us against the world you was no where to be found 
 Where the fuck were you dawg? Where the fuck were you? 
 Where the fuck were you man? Where the fuck were you? 
 Now they show us love when we step up in this place 
 Like fuck 'em if they hating middle finger to your face! 
 Middle finger to your face, haha 
 Middle finger to your face aye middle finger to your face haha 
 Now you want something from us but we can't do nun for you so long 
 (My nigga so long, so long, so long, my nigga so long) 
 Can't catch up 'cause we gone haha! yeah we gone! 
 Y'all slept on these motherfuckas for too fucking long 
 Now they show us respect but its way overdue 
 Through all this shit we stayed true but where the fuck were you? 
 Where the fuck were you?
