When I speak it's like y'all don't hear 
 Why I feel like God don't care 
 Why I feel like I ain't good as no one else 
 I'm searching but my pride ain't there 
 I just feel like life ain't fair 
 My boy got shot, died right there 
 But me, I died twice and came back to life 
 So tell me how can I be scared 
 Why do I gotta doubt myself 
 All I ever do is doubt myself 
 Drink liquor till the head gets consumed by the pint, like 
 I don't care about my health 
 Really I'm just trying to numb the pain 
 Love and hate it all just feels the same 
 Won't say I'm affected by the fame 
 But even my momma know I changed 
 So I get drunk till I can't feel 
 The love fake, the pain real 
 Got so many scars it ain't heal 
 But I gotta soul bullets can't kill 
 Why I feel like cops just want to pop me 
 Pop's never had a pot to piss in 
 Probably pack a nine on his hip then sit beside me 
 Pray to God there's no triple six inside me 
 No I can't let the devil in my mind 
 Same time the church will turn you blind 
 Last time I heard a preacher preach a sermon 
 All I heard him say was sinner's going to die 
 And they will never get to see a Heaven 
 With all due respect fuck the reverend 
 'Cause I know life was doing 25 
 Praying for early death like it's a blessing 
 This for my people going through depression 
 This for the kids who never felt affection 
 This for the kids whose parents don't accept them 
 Saying they love everyone else except them 
 I know what it's like to feel alone 
 I know what it's like to need a home 
 I know what it's like to not know what it's like 
 To have a love you can call your own 
 See I done tried every single fucking drug on that shelf 
 Trust me man it don't help 
 I just feel like I'm losing myself 
 Why I feel like love don't last 
 Things change when you move so fast 
 I was trying to focus on us in the future 
 You was focused on my past 
 If you left I would lose my soul 
 Promise me that you won't let go 
 See I just need love it's funny 
 I got all money but my heart still broke 
 So many times I said I'ma change 
 Just to turn around and do the same 
 Same shit that's been putting you in pain 
 I know I'm the only one to blame 
 So I get drunk, till I can't see 
 I love you, but I hate me 
 Trying to be someone I can't be 
 And I ain't been myself lately 
 Why I feel like I'm the only one that got me 
 You could take the same 45 that shot me 
 Pop the clip in, cock it back and put that motherfucker to my head 
 You'll never stop me 
 Yeah I be living life on the edge 
 Suicide all in my head 
 Why the world don't care about no one else's life till they already dead 
 I just wish pops was back to how he was 
 'Cause he ain't been the same since the drugs 
 And I ain't been the same 
 Since he said the worst form of pain is not being loved 
 So we use the drugs they gave to us 
 To replace the love the world takes from us 
 Lately I don't even know who to trust 
 They saying even Satan was an angel once 
 So I can't feel shit, so numb that I can't feel shit 
 Living just to die 
 We dying just to live this life it doesn't make no sense 
 See I done tried every single fucking drug on that shelf 
 Trust me man it don't help 
 I just feel like I'm losing myself
