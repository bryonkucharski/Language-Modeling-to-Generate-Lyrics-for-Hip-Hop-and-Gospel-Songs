We in this, mind your fuckin' business, nigga 
 Look, check it, look. 
 Nowadays everybody wants somethin' from me 
 Always askin' me for a favor or some fuckin' money 
 And they actin' like I'm swimmin' in cash 
 But I'm just tryin' to make this little bit last 
 I'm with this new girl and I kind of think we did it too fast 
 We should have waited, but that shit's in the past 
 And I can't change it, I'm hopin' that she's different 
 I hate dinner with the same shit 
 She says I make her happy, that doesn't make sense 
 Because I haven't been happy since '09 
 Even with four hundred fans around me at showtime 
 I keep tellin' myself that I'm happy with what I'm doin' 
 But the truth is I feel like something's missing 
 I'm about to lose it 
 'Bout to lose my focus, 'bout to lose my mind 
 Got me feelin' hopeless all the fuckin' time. 
 And these niggas around me don't make it better 
 Tryin' to start a fight over a female or some cheddar 
 Ego too big walkin' 'round like I'm on somethin' 
 But I never waste my time 'cause I know it's nothin' 
 And I know where I'm headed, yes I know the situations 
 They gon' get left in and I ain't havin' it 
 Everyone's actin' like I'm their boy 
 But I think back to when I didn't have no money, didn't have no girls 
 Didn't have no fame, didn't have the world, look, in the palm of my hands 
 Now they see I'm makin' moves and they wanna be friends 
 Y'all disgust me 
 My mind is filled with doubt when the woman tells me she loves me 
 'Cause does she love me for me 
 Or 'cause I'm the dude that all her friends are comin' to see? 
 Niggas only nice to me when they want somethin' for free 
 But I just try to keep my distance and do nothin' but me 
 And I got a lot of, heh, yeah I got a lot of pressure on my shoulders 
 I think of all the people I'll be next to when it's over 
 Nothin' lasts forever, and neither will I 
 I just hope that you remember me when I die 
 Real shit, don't get mad if I don't answer your calls 
 'Cause I'm too busy tryin' to catch what I lost. 
 Old friends say I'm fake and I changed how I used to be 
 But I'm just growing up and learning newer things 
 And if you can't understand it then cut me loose 
 But I guarantee you everything I tell you is the truth 
 Niggas all up in my face tellin' me I need to speak to you 
 Back the fuck up, I need some breathing room.
