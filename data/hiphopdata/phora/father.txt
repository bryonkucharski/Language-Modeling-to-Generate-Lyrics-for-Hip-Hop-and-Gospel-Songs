Yeah, alone in this room, just me and my conscious 
 Wondering if the lords really watching 'cause 
 If he is then tell me why I've been going through hell 
 Lately and I just don't feel like heaven's an option 
 Look, I feel the guilt pouring in 
 I wonder if he feels my pain 
 'Cause everyday it's getting more intense 
 Moms could barely afford the rent 
 Had to do some shady shit to survive 
 But I just hope the lord forgives 
 Is he forgiving like they say he is 
 Is there anyway away from this 
 Is there even anyplace where kids go when they pass away 
 I heard somebody say there is 
 But I don't know who to trust no more 
 And grandma said I really shouldn't cuss no more 
 But I just tell her "I'mma try" and knowing I'mma stay the same 
 I try to change so many times, I can't adjust no more 
 Shit, but father when will I see more smiles and frowns 
 Where do I go when I'm buried deep in the ground 
 Father why is the world never holding me up 
 I feel like I'm always letting you down 
 I feel like I'm always letting you down 
 I feel like I'm always letting you down 
 I often wonder bout who I'm a disappointment to 
 But no matter how good you do, they still point at you 
 Sometimes I don't know how I get through the day 
 'Cause even though you see me smile, it don't mean I'm okay 
 I just don't wanna be bothered with questions 
 Father why these cats always causing problems 
 I've been constantly stressing 
 Shit, I wonder if he's even listening to me 
 Searching for answers, but ain't nobody giving em' to me 
 Plus my girl needs attention, I can feel the tension 
 My pops is on a drinking binge 
 And he's on the break of an intervention 
 But he taught me so much with only his actions 
 What I learned from him, he would never imagine 
 If there was something that I would want him to know 
 Every mistake he made, it was all meant to happen 
 No time wasted 'cause I learned from it all 
 Made me a better man inside, made me learn when I fall 
 There's always a reason to get back up on your feet 
 So if you hear me lord, I hope you could answer this for me 
 Father when will I see more smiles and frowns 
 Where do I go when I'm buried deep in the ground 
 Father why is the world never holding me up 
 I feel like I'm always letting you down 
 I feel like I'm always letting you down
