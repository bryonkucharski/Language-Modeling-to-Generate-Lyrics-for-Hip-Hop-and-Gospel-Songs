Late nights in the city 
 Just me and the team 
 We been on the grind like 24/7 just kids with a dream 
 Late nights in the city 
 Mighta been drinking too much 
 But I been going through a lot 
 Man, these past 2 weeks I been thinking too much 
 I've been thinking about Mom tryna feed my fam 
 Never had a label, they ain't seen my plan 
 Did this shit alone, they didn't even no ask 
 Nowadays all these niggas with they egos, man 
 For real, y'all too stuck up 
 Come around here and prolly get fucked up 
 Pops taught me in the streets there's no trust, so I trust no man 
 Yeah it's all fucked up, shit I'm fucked up 
 Sippin till we catching a buzz 
 Used to be catching a bus, now we catching them flights 
 Cruising through the city, we watching the skyline like it's my time 
 Anything can happen tonight 
 Chu know 
 She said I know whatchu mean 
 Don't run from your feelings, you can show 'em to me 
 And she said don't stress too much 
 Just go and live your life 'cause you're livin' what most of them dream 
 I told her I ain't gotta worry about a thing 
 All my niggas true and we livin' like some kings 
 Roll up a blunt, they be puffin' that green 
 You know 
 Late nights in the city, just me and and my crew 
 Ridin' around the town with my head down low 
 Livin' life fast and be sippin' like slow 
 Ridin' around town with my niggas with my shit full blast 
 AC blowin' we triyn' to get this cash 
 We tryna make these moves because they said we couldn't 
 And everybody in my circle down for taking a bullet, my nigga what 
 Got my windows down 
 All I get is love when I'm in your town 
 So why the fuck is you hating 
 I do this shit for my family 
 And moms said the other day she's never been so proud 
 She seen the good when they all saw the devil in me 
 Labels over here tryna sell me a dream 
 I ain't trippin' 
 It's just me and the team 
 And baby you should see the view in my city, it's a helluva scene 
 Shit I got 
 Good intentions and bad moves 
 A body full of tattoos 
 With the world on my back and checked off list 
 Of all the shit they said I can't do 
 Everything is all right, everything is cool 
 Late nights in the city dawg, just me and the crew 
 But I've been stressin' so much man, shit I need a lil break 
 My city can't wait 
 They've been holding me down 
 Reppin' my town, I ain't got no time for no fakes 
 So I'm sippin' slow for the Henny goin' down my throat 
 Reppin' my city like it's the only one I know 
 Focused my mind and write down my goals 
 I might've lost my friends, but I found my soul 
 I know 
 Late night conversations 
 She asked I was happy with the life I lead 
 And all I do is tell her I'm just glad to be alive on nights like these 
 I told her I ain't gotta worry about a thing 
 All my niggas true and we livin' like some kings 
 Roll up a blunt, they be puffin' that green 
 You know 
 Late nights in the city, just me and and my crew 
 Ridin' around the town with my head down low 
 Livin' life fast and be sippin' like slow
