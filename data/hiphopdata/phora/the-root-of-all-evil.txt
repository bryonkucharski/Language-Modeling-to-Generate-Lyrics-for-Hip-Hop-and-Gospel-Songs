Homie I done seen death and came back 
 So what the fuck you think I'm afraid of 
 Dis loyal niggas, I see what they made of 
 And I don't trust a soul but the family 
 'Cause I heard too many people say they love me when it ain't love 
 They ain't nothing but snakes in the grass 
 Me I never trust a cute face and an ass 
 'Cause all these bitches simple, I can see it in they face 
 How many of these snakes will turn fake for the cash 
 But careful what you wish for and the karma you creating 
 'Cause money ain't nothing when your life get taken 
 Ain't nobody bulletproof, the number one mistake 
 That these motherfuckers make is thinking they ain't got replacements 
 I bet they give up their self respect for the wealth 
 Don't believe me homie? check for yourself 
 'Cause what makes you think they got respect for you 
 When these niggas ain't even got respect for they selves 
 I put my mama in a house before I'm in a Benz 
 I'll die twice and come back before I get new friends 
 Nigga and I'll take my spot back on the couch 
 Before I'll ever be a slave to the dollar amount 
 I put my mama in a house before I'm in a Benz 
 I'll die twice and come back before I get new friends 
 Look and I'll take my spot back on the couch 
 'Cause I'll never be a slave to the money I count nigga 
 I got em' saying where the fuck you at, front to the back 
 I got em' saying where the fuck you at, where you at, front to the back 
 Like where the fuck you at, where the fuck you headed nigga 
 Nah, I don't think you get it nigga 
 Give a fuck about the money in our bank accounts 
 'Cause it ain't nothing if we dead my nigga 
 I seen hell, I seen niggas sling their mama dope 
 I seen niggas fiend for a line of coke 
 Money make a thirsty chick hop up out her jeans 
 Do things you only see in your dreams if you got the dough 
 Yeah, it got these niggas acting strange 
 They chasing the dollars, they ain't after change 
 Nah, me and them will never be alike, we'll never be the same 
 Now I'll never forget where my family came nigga 
 Y'all ain't got no chain, heard if you ain't balling, you ain't got no name 
 Fuck the money, 'cause I'd rather call out like Cobain 
 With a bullet through my temple, now I got no brains 
 Like fuck em' and fuck the world, you can have it dawg 
 Y'all ain't no better, I ain't mad at y'all 
 'Cause I'd rather be buried in my grave 
 Than live life like a slave 
 Fuck the money, you can have it all 
 I put my mama in a house before I'm in a Benz 
 I'll die twice and come back before I get new friends 
 Nigga and I'll take my spot back on the couch 
 Before I'll ever be a slave to the dollar amount 
 I put my mama in a house before I'm in a Benz 
 I'll die twice and come back before I get new friends 
 Look and I'll take my spot back on the couch 
 'Cause I'll never be a slave to the money I count nigga 
 I got em' saying where the fuck you at, front to the back 
 I got em' saying where the fuck you at, where you at, front to the back 
 Like where the fuck you at, where the fuck you headed nigga 
 Nah, I don't think you get it nigga 
 Give a fuck about the money in our bank accounts 
 'Cause it ain't nothing if we dead my nigga
