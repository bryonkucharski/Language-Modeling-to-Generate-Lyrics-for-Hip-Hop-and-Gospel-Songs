I do not talk, I am just a rapper. 
 Childish Gambino, doper than twenty kilos 
 Feeling me no Aveeno, pardon me that's my ego. 
 Nigga I'm on, my swagga on He-Man. 
 Down for Community, these other niggas Glee fans. 
 You cannot see my you are blind like venetians. 
 Eyes wide open, nigga stay focused. 
 Batman on these niggas, I am tired of these jokers 
 And my brain is too expressive, and your mind is on the local 
 Motherfucker I ain't playing 
 Ironic, I am Child 
 This addressing all you niggas, 
 Now you motherfuckers stylish. 
 And get me any indie song, I promise to annihil' it 
 My mouth will kill everyone, I guess that bitch Annihilus 
 Yeah my girls are the wildest, they're in love with a weirdo. 
 I am so different I am Protege, my hero. 
 Self made phenom, green like tree frogs, 
 Save every penny like Inspector Gadget reruns. 
 My name is Donald Glover, 
 Talented motherfucker. 
 Childish is my cover 
 To hide this shit from my mother. 
 She can't know how I'm livin', 
 I'm drinkin' and fuckin' women, 
 And she is Jehovah Witness 
 And don't believe in all this shit. 
 But I gotta handle business, 
 Kick it like soccer. 
 Upper-class kit-kat 
 Break 'em off proper. 
 I am just a rapper, 
 Sick Boy is my click man 
 You are not a Sick Boy, you are just a sick man. 
 Take some Dimetapp, yeah these ho's a dime a tap 
 'Less you get caught by them bitches 
 Better keep your penis wrapped 
 Then you are just a rapper, 
 The sky is the limit. 
 Don't put nothing on the game, 
 Just put something back in it.
