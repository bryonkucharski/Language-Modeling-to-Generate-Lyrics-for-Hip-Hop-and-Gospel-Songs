 I'm blowin' up like my swagger on the Gaza 
 I'm writing movies where I'm making out with Aubrey Plaza 
 And homegirl my homegirl, it is not like that 
 But if she tried to rape me, I would not fight back 
 Girls that turn me down are sayin' please and sorry 
 You lucky that I'm Randy, Aziz Ansari 
 So now I'm in the club tellin' strippers they should back it up 
 I wanna hang with Lil Wayne, I just hope that I'm black enough 
 Damn, I guess we're all friends here 
 Except for I don't know you, like you was me last year 
 It's funny how these niggas all treat me like we best friends 
 I wanna fuck these small girls, minus "sm" 
 Meaning that I fuck all girls, that is wordplay 
 Catch me on my iPhone doing what the birds say 
 I ain't going nowhere somebody better tell a hater 
 He's goin' down like my living room elevator 
 Fuck what you heard, bitch I'll fuck your fuckin' brains out 
 And make you wash your boyfriend's sheets to get the stains out 
 Put your fucking boots on it's time to kick the lanes out 
 You got your favorite rapper in your ear, it's time to change out

 Watch your girlfriend, I'll fuck her then I up and leave her 
 Girls chase me like they think my dick is Justin Bieber 
 Pussy thrown at me, you fuckin' with a wide receiver 
 I'm a genius, and I don't need to hide it either 
 Got a lot of hay, let me pay for what you sip tonight 
 Mixed girls from Williamsburg, that's my fucking kryptonite 
 Baby girl, shorty, have it however you want it 
 Whatever you asking bout, I promise you that I done it 
 My swagger's New York but my home is the South 
 And it's amazing how I eat more pussy than Alf 
 And I'll all up in your ear but then I'm all in your mouth 
 I don't talk, but girls the only thing we're talkin' about
