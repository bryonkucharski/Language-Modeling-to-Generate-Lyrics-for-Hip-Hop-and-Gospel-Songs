We can go to Saturn, it doesn't really matter 
 We can get there, we can do it if we try 
 You know that I love you, put no one else above you 
 We can get there, we can do it if we try 
 Gambino: 
 Knock, knock, it's me 
 I'mma take ya fine ass out to Applebee's 
 Get anything you want, this shit is free 
 My friend work here 
 Whatcha mean, I ain't romantic? 
 I bought you flowers, so what they plastic? 
 We could fuck for hours, so what, I'm nasty? 
 I ain't got the roommate, that was my old place 
 I'mma take you to the crib and show you the 'O' face 
 You make me feel like I'm back in the 5th grade 
 Had a crush on Keana and she rocked the one braid 
 And I thought that sex was when you touched a girl's butt 
 You could get a girl pregnant, so look, but don't touch 
 I like you so much, I know it sound crazy 
 But I'd have a sex change just so I could have your baby 
 The roles are reversed, so you got a huge dick, and I got a Prada purse 
 A nigga so sick, that my car's a doctor 
 Take a gamble on a nigga that your name was Proctor 
 Kick it in Chinese like you're Shaolin soccer 
 Got nothin' but dinero, so you meetin' the Fockers 
 Look at my clock-ers, it's time to roll out 
 Get sneaks, sneaks, and sneaks, and they sold out 
 That's what I'm all about and if you got the time 
 It's hard to make change when you want one dime 
 We can go to Saturn, it doesn't really matter 
 We can get there, we can do it if we try 
 You know that I love you, put no one else above you 
 We can get there, we can do it if we try 
 Eugene Cordero: 
 Welcome back everyone to 'The Noise in Space' 
 Got a new constellation for you to trace 
 Use the far East star for your startin' place 
 You see it? My big dipper slappin' you in the face 
 Step out of the shed, let the sun be felt 
 On your head as you undo Orion's belt 
 Oh nuts! I just crashed landed on the planet of the gay cliché 
 Talkin' Milky Way, bouquets, Broadway, bubblay and Michael Bublé 
 Sorry if I caught you off-guard with my five-second delay 
 But the jet-lag's making me loopy and my sales are soupy 
 Soupy Sales! I eat chocolate! 
 We can go to Saturn, it doesn't really matter 
 We can get there, we can do it if we try 
 You know that I love you, put no one else above you 
 We can get there, we can do it if we try 
 We can go to Saturn, it doesn't really matter 
 We can get there, we can do it if we try 
 You know that I love you, put no one else above you 
 We can get there, we can do it if we try
