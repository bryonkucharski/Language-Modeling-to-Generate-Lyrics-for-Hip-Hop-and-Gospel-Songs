See now I don't wanna see an era, an era, an era 
 See now I just wanna live forever and ever 
 Maybe it's the last night 
 Maybe it's the last night 
 When the world was with this and that 
 I was young, didn't know to hold it back 
 Now we here and the world is something else 
 We could leave any day you call for help 
 We were gods, nobody was above me 
 That "A" on my chest like adultery 
 That "A" on my chest, put your fist up 
 That "A" on my chest like a chipmunk 
 Alvin, Theodore 
 Breathe in, breathe out, mi amor 
 Breathe in, breathe out, nevermind 
 It was time, number nine, lies 
 Feline with a deathwish 
 E-vite didn't help shit 
 No name on the guest list 
 Hold on, we're destined 
 See now I don't wanna see an era, an era, an era 
 See now I just wanna live forever and ever 
 Maybe it's the last night 
 (you and me) 
 Maybe it's the last night 
 (fireworks) 
 Maybe it's the last night 
 (under the stars) 
 Maybe it's the last night 
 All that I have 
 All I don't ask the future 
 Turn your eyes, so 
 All night 
 Yeah, break free from all of the insides 
 They godless, denied us 
 But we don't give a damn about the next day 
 We were never here, never know if the world change 
 Common sense, the consequences 
 Retweet the tweet then regret the mentions 
 We are the wireless survivors of things gone 
 Slaves to the unnamed, never live long 
 Live and die by the line, never know fear 
 Even I won't survive, is it unfair? 
 Is it unfair? 'Cause I don't care 
 When I step on that ant on the grass 
 Progress the only thing that will last 
 3005 
 The year that we fear, only God will survive 
 To be alone is alive 
 See now I don't wanna see an era, an era, an era 
 See now I just wanna live forever and ever 
 Maybe it's the last night 
 Maybe it's the last night 
 Maybe it's the last night 
 Maybe it's the last night 
 See now I don't wanna see an era, an era, an era 
 See now I just wanna live forever and ever 
 Maybe it's the last night 
 Maybe it's the last night 
 Maybe it's the last night 
 Maybe it's the last night
