I do not, I do not, I am just, I am just a rapper 
 Sick boy make moves like a chess piece 
 And that move real quick like Nestle 
 Let me make it clear for a second like Pepsi 
 I was never worried bout my wallet bein' empty 
 'Cause when it was empty, I was still happy 
 Walkin' with my Walkman, freestyle rappin' 
 High school bullies like what the fuck happened 
 Nigga off the hook like I fuckin' shot the captain 
 And this supposed to be relaxin', rappin' is my hobby 
 I did this in my bedroom where I separate my laundry 
 Watchin' old episodes of Shining Time Station 
 You are now listening to my mouth on vacation (ation) 
 Why you doing this, what's your motivation? 
 I am just a rapper, I don't need the paper 
 No Will Smith went off without a hitch man 
 C-H-I-L-D it's the ISH man 
 Do sixteen bars no wristband 
 I'll always be childish, call me Maggie Simpson 
 Run the track like my tongue's an Olympian 
 I've always been this good, you just weren't listening 
 I'mma try to make my street cred stack up 
 I mean I'm rapping over Grizzy Bear, what the fuck 
 Gather swagger up, before I take it all 
 You started rapping when you wasn't good at basketball 
 I started rapping 'cause I fucking need some Adderall 
 I can't do one thing, I'm just too good 
 I can't do one thing, I am Tiger Woods 
 I make you iPod hotter than a lighter would 
 Picture me in sixth grade, overweight, overbite 
 Got my fake Adidas on, whiting out the fourth stripe 
 Kid named Vincent got it out for me, I hate that guy 
 Frodo from Chicago, really small and shy 
 You better recognize, 'cause I'm no better now 
 'Cause I was always sick, my life's a hospital 
 And that's some funny shit, that turd is Apatow 
 That female dog is blind, well bitch look at me now! 
 I'm wearing tight jeans, and nobody's laughing 
 More pussy than recycled sanitary napkins 
 Bitch sitting shotgun in my Tracy Chapman 
 I did exactly what you niggas said would never happen. 
 I'm doing me so big I can hardly walk 
 These rappers need ER like they're Charlie Park 
 Stay hard like my suit made by Tony Stark 
 This kinda music make your balls drop, Dick Clark 
 Yes I'm grown and sexy, and I'm worth the wait 
 Girls act like I'm the only dude on earth to date 
 Put these words on your head and let them percolate 
 We need to separate church and state. 
 I used to have to pay for gas in my momma's Saturn 
 And now I'm paying for a mortgage as a working actor 
 If living my life is what you say you're chasing after 
 Nigga stop talking shit and just be a rapper (be a rapper).
