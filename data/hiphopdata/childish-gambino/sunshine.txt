Baby I'm living the dream 
 With you by my side we work as a team 
 I know I'm a mac, it's not what it seems 
 I'm covered in pink, from swimming in green 
 When I'm eating you like Edy and me 
 Mama the stars could not intervene 
 You are a star, I'm keeping it clean 
 You are the prettiest girl I have seen 
 What does that mean? It means you're the one 
 And most of these dudes are just fucking for fun 
 Girl you know that I would never do that to you 
 All of the girls that I do must be beautiful 
 Inside and out, meaning your mouth 
 Girl I'm just playin', this is what I'm sayin' 
 If you like real, then give me a go 
 If you never try, then you'll never know 
 Ooh it's all right, ooh it's okay 
 Let them all know that I got this way 
 'Cause I miss you girl 
 I wanna be with you, yeah 
 And if the sun don't come out 
 Ooh it's okayExplain 
 Let them all know that I got this way 
 'Cause I miss you girl 
 I wanna be with you, yeah 
 Never, ever, ever let me go 
 Do you love me? Girl I need to know 
 'Cause you're my sunshine girl 
 'Cause you're my sunshine, sunshine, oh 
 Baby girl, you're always on my mind 
 Baby girl, it's time to make you mine 
 'Cause you're my sunshine girl 
 'Cause you're my sunshine, sunshine, oh 
 Look, I'm the man to know 
 I'm the one to give you more 
 Ma, you got that stupid flow 
 I talk about moms like Margaret Cho 
 And I'mma go, minus the "o" 
 So I'm a g, sportin' a V- 
 Neck and a check, on my shoes 
 'Cause I got nothin' to lose, uh 
 I'm in it to win it 
 Money so long I get business from Guinness 
 Diving in green, I'm swimming in spinach 
 And I'm in the race, who cares about finish? 
 I got an advantage, and I'm an advantage 
 I'm ?, you need an advantage 
 And nothing is heinous so I can work for ya 
 Couldn't stand out, girl 
 Ooh it's all right, ooh it's okay 
 Let them all know that I got this way 
 'Cause I miss you girl 
 I wanna be with you, yeah 
 And when the sun don't come out 
 Ooh it's okay 
 Let them know I got this way 
 'Cause I miss you girl 
 I wanna be with you, yeah 
 Never, ever, ever let me go 
 Do you love me? Girl I need to know 
 'Cause you're my sunshine girl 
 'Cause you're my sunshine, sunshine, oh 
 Baby girl, you're always on my mind 
 Baby girl, it's time to make you mine 
 'Cause you're my sunshine girl 
 'Cause you're my sunshine, sunshine, oh
