Wake up, wake up 
 Gotta get this paper, get this cake up 
 Gotta do my hair, gotta put on makeup 
 Gotta act like I care about this fake stuff 
 Straight up what a waste of my day 
 If I had it my way I'd roll out of bed 
 Say bout 2:30 mid day 
 Hit the blunt then, hit you up to come over to my place 
 You show up right away 
 We make love then and then we fuck 
 And then you'd give me my space 
 Hey 
 What I am trying to say is 
 The love is ours to make so we should make it 
 Everything else can wait 
 The time is ours to take so we should take it 
 Wake up, wake up, bake up 
 Gotta heat the vape up 
 Let's get faded 
 Gotta call your job tell em' you won't make it 
 Ain't nobody here baby let's get wasted 
 We should just get naked 
 'Cause I be working hard and I know you be on that same shit 
 Every other day's a different game that you just can't win 
 I just want to ease your mind and make you feel all right 
 So go head tell your baby mama you gon be with me tonight 
 Right 
 What I am trying to say is 
 The love is ours to make, so we should make it 
 Everything else can wait 
 The time is ours to take so we should take it 
 It's not love, but it's pretty close 
 Hot fudge and a little smoke 
 I didn't mean it means nothing to you 
 Hands locked on my black couch with nothing to do 
 Can't stop on cloud 20 
 Buried in the drugs, but the feels keeps coming 
 Finally stop crying, but your nose is still running 
 Wipe it on my shirt, haha I need sleep 
 You tell me that you wanna do it big 
 I love it when you say "guess what?" (What? What?) 
 Reading stories to some other nigga kid 
 And I wonder why I'm all messed up (up up up up) 
 'Cause we gotta be responsible sometimes 
 Being a class act nevermind my alumni 
 I don't wanna be a round a baby so dumb high 
 I don't see the beauty of a momma on insides 
 Curled up with my head on your chest 
 It's the best remedy for the pain and the stress 
 If the world doesn't change then we'll never get dressed 
 It will be like this to the kiss of the death 
 Of my soul, bowl of the blue dream, no 
 Not a good team, once soul, two halves 
 No joke, who laughs? 
 Just us (Just us, just us) 
 Okay, got this OJ and Jose 
 Mixed it up with that Rose 
 We gon' do this our own way 
 All right, okay 
 What is it that your smoking? 
 Piece it up with this peace and love 
 And this peace and love like the old days 
 What I am trying to say is 
 The love is ours to make so we should make it 
 Everything else can wait 
 The time is ours to take so we should take it 
 We should stay right here 
 We should lay right here 
 'Cause everything is okay right here 
 You should stay right here 
 We should lay right here 
 'Cause everything is okay right here
