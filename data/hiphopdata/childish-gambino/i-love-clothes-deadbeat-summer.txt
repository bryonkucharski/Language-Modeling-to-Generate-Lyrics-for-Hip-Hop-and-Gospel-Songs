I do not talk, I am just a rapper 
 Nigga, I'm the capper 
 Rapper slash not actor 
 'Cause I could never act the part of being fakey 
 You should really thank me 
 Who else would do this shit? 
 All that fucking wishing and waiting 
 These niggas are mistakin 
 You don't speak my language 
 Dressed like Ma cambridge 
 Bowtie make me muslim 
 Switch for suspenders 
 Two at least 
 Clickin through our hyperbeast 
 Tom Brown, Hells Bells, Kitsune, Jay L 
 I don't wear your shirt unless it got a logo 
 Now it's to go out and walk around soho 
 All high schools showing out, Pay less. 
 Man fuck that, yo I earned this. 
 I love clothes. 
 Go to top man 
 That's the hot spot 
 Check Kayne's blog for the high tops 
 Check shake appeal lookbook right quick 
 They hooking up with ambush, that's it 
 Spare a top cider with a black trim 
 Pink leather jacket, gotta get him 
 New t-shirt and I put it all 
 On a charge card 
 Burning through my go yard 
 And it's so dumb, but it's so tight 
 Ain't nothing like new shoes every night 
 And it feels so good in the new jeans 
 And the new shirt, it's addicting 
 I'm an addict 
 I don't want help, I'm a die in my brand new Louis belt. 
 But not Louis, it's too gaudy 
 Check the lime green frames this girl bought me 
 Billionaire boys club, I'm living it 
 One shirt, eight dubs 
 I'm spending it 
 Got shoes that I know I won't wear 
 And the problem is I don't really care 
 Got money, but nothing is forever 
 Every time I gotta buy I new sweater 
 By 211 I'll be dead broke 
 I'll be the homeless dude in a peacoat.
