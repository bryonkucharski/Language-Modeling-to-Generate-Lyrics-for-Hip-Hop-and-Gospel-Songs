I do not talk, I am just a rapper 
 I am so different, being me is like the lottery 
 I am so on like the TV when you fall asleep 
 Niggas makin' pottery, but I broke the mold 
 Now my has got them dancing like I channel Oakenfold 
 Yes, I got a lust for life, and I drink my weight in whiskey 
 And these hoes are actin' different 'cause I'm Rich comma Richie 
 These friends are iffy, they're alcoholic geniuses 
 I think they hang around until I'm drunk and buy them Guinnesses 
 I gotta drink my medicine to cover what's inside of me 
 I'm still fucked up from the days nobody liked me 
 I'm lying just a little when I say that I don't give a fuck 
 You know I gotta give a fuck 
 My face is broken out 
 My shirt is hand-me-down 
 This kid named Vincent wanna take my shit and lay me out 
 I'm trying to fit in like a fat bitch in her shoe size 
 It's funny I'm flyer now than witches on their broom rides 
 I always thought these new clothes were the potion 
 'Cause I never felt that good in my own skin 
 It's probably 'cause I'm the only black kid in my school 
 And when I meet another black kid they tell me I'm a fool 
 'Cause I wear thee tight clothes, tight jeans, tight shirt 
 Yeah I stay tight like these girls that make my dick hurt 
 Yeah, I'm self conscious 
 Go ahead - laugh it up 
 'Cause I dig deep and pull something out to back it up 
 They told my ass to blacken up 
 What the fuck are you? 
 You don't even say shit 
 Quit writing gay shit 
 Now they see me and have to squint like asians 
 'Cause I'm on fire and everything I touch is blazing 
 Giving you the realness 
 Kid I got a lot of it 
 Listen to my mixtapes, tell me if they contradict 
 Don't fuck with these niggas cause this swag is abstinent 
 I don't have time to eat 
 I don't have time to sleep 
 These niggas got time to do 
 Everything but be unique 
 I gotta do me like I'm jerkin' in the mirror 
 I am just a rapper 
 Can't make it clearer 
 Yes I'm in the building 
 No I own the company 
 Your girlfriend's sister... you cannot fuck with me 
 Childish Gambino 
 We are all children 
 I am just a murderer 
 We have just killed them
