Small chick with a fat ass 
 Did I say that out loud, let me backtrack 
 I know my game ain't that bad 
 Have you ever made out with a Gap ad? 
 And girls want what they can't have 
 So I don't text back when the screen flash 
 You love me, you mean cash 
 Need a friend you can fuck, I can be that 
 Crush girls now, couldn't last year 
 Oh, you like me now, well that's weird 
 Last year you were chilling with Lil Wayne 
 Now you wanna pretend like my feelings is still the same? 
 My work is my playtime 
 I need you to understand and to stay fine 
 Do this and I just might wife you 
 Let me poke-ya-mom, Raichu 
 Fuck ya life 
 I don't really think I drank enough tonight 
 Looking at you, make me wanna fuck for life 
 Lame-ass dudes gon' suck tonight 
 But so are these girls, am I wrong or right? 
 Girl, do somethin' to me 
 "Nah, baby, you way too hood for me" 
 Y'all girls have never been good for me 
 Watch a nigga take over, mutiny 
 I wanna fuck with the lights on 
 Hey, girl, let a python slide on 
 Stay sick, infect me, Lysol 
 I'm on the edge, they hopin' that I might fall 
 I make it work, I'm runnin' with a new crew 
 And we do dope shit you ain't used to 
 For me, by me, fuck Fubu 
 This girl never heard of me, go and check YouTube 
 I got a house with a dope view 
 See the ocean, dope shit, you an '06, I'm an '02 
 But enough about high school 
 I'm getting laid, or I'm getting lied to 
 You my stand-in Cameron, lemme be your A-Rod 
 You number one in The Pack, Based God 
 Should I say somethin' dumb to give us somethin' to fight about? 
 Never mind, lights out 
 I want the lights turned on 
 Show me how you do it 
 Show me what you doin' 
 I don't wanna lose 
 Have them lights turned on 
 Show me what you doin' 
 Show me what you do to me, me 
 Swag 
 2:30 and we still makin' progress 
 Talkin' on Twitter to see where to go next 
 3:30, man, where did the time go? 
 I'm chillin' with this Asian chick I met in Chicago 
 She look like the Social Network chick 
 Except for her ass is twice as thick, man 
 Just wanna bite that shit 
 Where the fuck did my license went? 
 I musta left it at the other place 
 I rent a loft downtown with a ton of space 
 Yeah, we doin' stupid shit, have stories when I'm older 
 But I don't wanna see pictures of us on Vulture 
 Never thought about a year ago 
 I'm chillin' out with the friends at the Super Bowl 
 Things change like a motherfuck 
 That's why I wild out, keep the city up 
 Uh, I talk a lot about the girls in my songs 
 But you are different from the girls in my songs 
 Stop talking about the girls in my songs 
 If you don't like it, I can just take you home 
 More green than the top of these tree trunks 
 Leave you boyfriend here, 'cause he punk 
 She like, "I'm not a slut," speed bump 
 By the way, what's your name, 'cause we drunk 
 I want the lights turned on 
 Show me how you do it (we druuuunk) 
 Show me what you doin' 
 I don't wanna lose (we druuuunk) 
 Have them lights turned on 
 Show me what you doin' (I'm drunk) 
 Show me what you do to me, me 
 I want the lights turned on 
 Show me how you do it 
 Show me what you doin' 
 I don't wanna lose 
 Have them lights turned on 
 Show me what you doin' 
 Show me what you do to me, me 
 I want the lights turned on 
 Show me how you do it (I got to get high) 
 Show me what you doin' 
 I don't wanna lose (I need to get high) 
 Have them lights turned on 
 Show me what you doin' (I got to get high) 
 Show me what you do to me, me (I got to get high) 
 I gots to get high 
 I need to get high 
 Uh, I needs to get high 
 Uh, I gots to get high
