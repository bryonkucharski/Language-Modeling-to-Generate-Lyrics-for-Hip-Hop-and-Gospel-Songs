All right it's Childish baby 
 Mr. Talk-about-his-dick-again 
 Nerdy ass black kid 
 Whatever man, I'm sick of him 
 That well-spoken token 
 Who ain't been heard 
 The only white rapper who's allowed to say the n-word 
 I buy a bunch of 'em and put it on my black card 
 Now I got some street cred 
 Use it till it's maxed out 
 I got a girl on my arm dude, show respect 
 Something crazy and Asian, Virginia Tech 
 She too fine 
 I do dimes 
 If not that, I'm walking out with 2 fives 
 Change my ID for the cops, it's not enough yet 
 Black male in short shorts, I'm double suspect 
 Ballin' since '83 
 Half of 'em say he gay 
 Maybe that's the reason I like Lady What-babies-say 
 I'm a problem 
 I'm lame as fuck homie 
 But I rap like these niggas ain't got shit on me 
 Fuck the cool kids 
 Not Chuck Inglish, but people who think 
 That hatin' on me makes them distinguished 
 Like, "What is this nigga doin' rap is for real blacks 
 I hate that fucking faggot man he think that we feel that" 
 Or 
 "I wrote on rape culture my junior year at Brown 
 So I'm allowed 
 To say what all his raps are about" 
 You better shut your mouth 
 Before I fuck it 
 You really hate my lyrics now? 
 Or Kid Cudi's? Nigga 
 Runnin' this thang 
 Money insane 
 Busy getting brain like Krang 
 What, what's my name in the woods got these niggas usin' MapQuest 
 Man, fuck a backpacker 
 Nigga's with OCD, N-W-O 
 All white like my clothes, CW shows 
 Nigga got signed, it's an anomaly 
 No cosine, trigonometry 
 Man these niggas hate me 
 "Man, fuck you nigga... fuck you nigga!" 
 They real black like won't show up on your camera phone 
 They real black like turn the flash on your camera on 
 They real black take shit, turn it into gold 
 I'm real black I survive when the pressure on 
 Upper echelon, bit my lip when I'm kissin' her 
 Clash of the titans 
 Baby, your tits is titular 
 Listenin' to some KISS FM, she wanna hear Nicki Minaj 
 Super Bass, super face inside a garage 
 It's not a massage 
 Spa rap with a happy ending 
 Old niggas wanna assassinate me 
 It's a shame 
 These kids was supposed to save rap 
 Fuck that, boat shoes and a wave cap 
 He don't give back, how the fuck a nigga say that? 
 Summer in November I gave everyone a Maybach 
 Comin' on that paint back 
 Comin' on that mace took 
 I'm comin' on that real shit 
 I'm comin' on her Facebook 
 Fuck a backpacker with a rhino's dick 
 I do me like a gyno chick, uh 
 Runnin' this thang 
 Money insane 
 Busy getting brain like Krang 
 What, what's my name in the woods got these niggas usin' MapQuest 
 Man, fuck a backpacker 
 Fuck you backpackers 
 Fuck you backpackers 
 Fuck you backpackers
