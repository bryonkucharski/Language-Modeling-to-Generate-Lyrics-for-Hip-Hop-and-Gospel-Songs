I used to dream every night, now I never dream at all 
 I'm hopin' that it's 'cause I'm livin' everything I want 
 I used to wake up in a bed between my mom and aunt 
 Playing with this Land Before Time toy from Pizza Hut 
 My dad works nights, putting on a stone face 
 He's saving up so we can get our own place 
 In the projects, man that sounds fancy to me 
 They called me fat nose, my mom say you handsome to me 
 Mrs. Glover ma'am, your son is so advanced 
 But he's acting up in class and keeps peeing in his pants 
 And I just wanna fit in, but nobody was helping me out 
 They talking hood shit and I ain't know what that was about 
 Cause hood shit and black shit is super different 
 So I'm talking hood shit and cool it now like New Edition 
 Mom and dad wouldn't listen 
 They left the Bronx so I wouldn't be that 
 All their friends in NY deal crack 
 It's weird, you think that they'd be proud of 'em 
 But when you leave the hood they think that you look down on 'em 
 The truth is we still struggle on a different plane 
 7 dollars an hour, WIC vouchers, it's all the same 
 Facebook messaging hopin' that could patch up shit 
 But all they get now is, "Can your son read this script?" 
 There's a world we can visit if we go outside 
 Outside, outside 
 We can follow the road 
 There's a world we can visit if we go outside 
 Outside, outside 
 No one knows 
 There's a world we can visit if we go outside 
 Outside, outside 
 We can follow the road 
 There's a world we can visit if we go outside 
 Outside, outside 
 No one knows 
 Yeah 
 Dad lost his job, mama worked at Mrs. Winner's 
 Gun pulled in her face, she still made dinner 
 "Donald watch the meter so they don't turn the lights off" 
 Workin' two jobs so I can get into that white school 
 And I hate it there 
 They all make fun of my clothes and wanna touch my hair 
 And my uncle on that stuff that got my grandma shook 
 Drug dealers roughed him up and stole his address book 
 He's supposed to pay 'em back 
 He owe 'em money but his bank account is zero 
 So my momma made us sleep with Phillips heads under the pillow 
 Like that would do somethin' 
 But she's got six kids, she's gotta do somethin' 
 She don't want me in a lifestyle like my cousin 
 And he mad cause his father ain't around 
 He lookin' at me now, like 
 "Why you so fuckin' lucky? I had a father too 
 But he ain't around so I'mma take it out on you" 
 We used to say "I love you," now we only think that shit 
 It feels weird that you're the person I took sink baths with 
 Street took you over, I want my cousin back 
 The world sayin' what you are because you're young and black 
 Don't believe 'em 
 You're still that kid that kept the older boys from teasin' 
 For some reason 
 There's a world we can visit if we go outside 
 Outside, outside 
 We can follow the road 
 There's a world we can visit if we go outside 
 Outside, outside 
 No one knows 
 There's a world we can visit if we go outside 
 Outside, outside 
 We can follow the road 
 There's a world we can visit if we go outside 
 Outside, outside 
 No one knows 
 Can you hear me now? 
 Can you hear me now? 
 Oh, help us Lord 
 Oh, baby baby baby
