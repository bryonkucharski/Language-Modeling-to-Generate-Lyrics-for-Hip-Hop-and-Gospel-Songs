Ooh, ah, oh yeah 
 Got to get on my grind 
 Got to get on my grind 
 Ooh, ah, oh yeah 
 Got to get on my grind 
 Got to get on my grind 
 Fallin' out, ooh, down 
 Got to get on my grind 
 Got to get on my grind 
 Oh, fallin' down, oh yeah 
 Got to get on my grind 
 Got to get on my grind 
 I turn 'em like Tina, I don't tote ninas 
 But a nigga walked up and get served like subpoenas 
 And I ain't broke neitha, I got a in-between 
 So when I say about a million what I mean is bitch fiend 
 I gotta keep grinding, my name Tony Hawk 
 'Cause I grind with my boys sometimes at the park 
 A heavy-ass kid, easy on the cake 
 Until I got to New York and I started losin' weight 
 And when I say "weight," I do mean "weight" 
 Now I'm thin like the line between love and hate 
 'Cause I used to go skate 
 Nigga I'm paid, this kid don't play like a high-top fade 
 I don't get laid, I'm back at the studio 
 The closest girls get is watchin' old Derrick videos 
 Girls don't get it, say I work too much 
 Pass boo the cell phone and say, "Girl, be in touch" 
 But we won't be in touch, I know that for sure 
 You ain't in love with me, you like my décor 
 Christian Dior, pastel and Jack 
 If it's in hot pink then it's on my back 
 I'm young and I'm black and the world is my oyster 
 Watchin' Top Chef on my European sofa 
 These niggas so fake like an old toupee 
 So clear call this shit Blu-Ray 
 Ooh yeah 
 Got to get on my grind 
 Got to get on my grind 
 Got to get on my grind 
 Oh, ah, oh yeah 
 Got to get on my grind 
 Got to get on my grind 
 Take me to a hospital, call me Ebola 
 And a nigga flow sweet, so I spit Coca-Cola 
 And my boys sold boulders, but I gotta do it my way 
 We grindin' the same, but we usin' different pathways 
 Gotta make ends meet, a means to an end 
 And I hate seein' niggas usin' "grind," for pretend 
 This ain't pretend, and I ain't pretendin' 
 We eatin' out late like I hang with the gremlins 
 Call David Geffen, we about to switch places 
 The game is a hold, got a pocket full of aces 
 Boy, I'm a phenom, I can't be stopped 
 Had my RA pager on my first day at 30 Rock 
 Headed for big things like I'm runnin' Salma Hayek 
 Four Seasons plus no more work at the Hyatt 
 I'm fly and I'm high like a pilot 
 But you can't see me like an eyelid, vibin', uh 
 Ooh 
 Got to get on my grind 
 Got to get on my grind 
 Got to get on my grind 
 Ah, ah 
 Got to get on my grind 
 Got to get on my grind 
 Got to get on my grind 
 Fallin' out, ooh, yeah 
 Got to get on my grind 
 Got to get on my grind 
 Got to get on my grind 
 Yeah
