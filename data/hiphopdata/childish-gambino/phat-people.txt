(Verse 1: Billy Scafuri) 
 One, two, three, check it out 
 On the road to sandwiches and chicken wings 
 Phat people do phat things 
 Using salt and pepper for their seasonings 
 Phat people do phat things 
 Check it out 
 It's B to the I to the double L-Y 
 My friends all know I'm not an ordinary guy 
 I like little things, like chicken wings 
 BBQ sauce, honey mustard, onion rings 
 And when my cell phone rings it goes jingle-jing 
 I say hello, I say hello, I say who this be? 
 They say it's Fancy Ned, I got a fancy head 
 I'll eat a fancy ass sandwich on some fancy ass bread 
 (Verse 2: Childish Gambino) 
 The wait is over, shut up, bend over 
 I hang with bar stools, I chill with Grover 
 The boy Ebola, my boy phat too 
 And my girl so phat that they call her Oprah 
 I got that green like a bowl of okra 
 Loose change so phat can't fit my sofa 
 I head to the bank, call the shit my grocer 
 It's Sex in the City, get the phat mimosa 
 Me and B, we phat boys, hang with phat girls 
 Driving phat toys, fuck Dan Aykroyd 
 I'm live on a Saturday night 
 I got two phat girls, I'm doing it right 
 Like my name John GoodmanExplain 
 I got the phat crib so I'm doing real good, man 
 And I'm up to no good, man 
 This is how I get phat, call the shit cooking 
 Phat people do phat things 
 (Verse 3: Billy Scafuri) 
 I tip waitresses, I tip scales 
 My style is kind of phat like an Orca whale 
 I'm sipping whole milk as I stare 
 Thinking I can be your Oprah, you can be my Gail 
 'Cause I am a phat boy, never been to Bally's 
 Married to this phat life, call me Kirstie Alley 
 Married to the snack life, counting every calorie 
 Might just open up a phat boy art gallery 
 (Verse 4: Childish Gambino and Billy Scafuri) 
 What else you do, B? 
 I'll make it easy 
 What else you do, B? 
 For girls to squeeze me 
 I'm phat but my numbers run 
 Listen son, I'mma show them how it's done 
 When my swagger weighs a ton 
 Stickin' straws inside of girls, you can call me the Capri Sun 
 (Verse 5: Childish Gambino) 
 I make the girls drip, so I guess I eat Gushers 
 Screaming out yeah like I'm eating out Usher 
 In your dad's bedroom where I fuck you 
 Knockin' on the door, so you're screaming out "nothing" 
 But they all know it's something 
 You didn't think I'd tear the pussy up, did you pumpkin? 
 But better and better like Benjamin Button 
 (Verse 6: Billy Scafuri) 
 I hang out with Chester Cheeto 
 Cooler than the ranch on your Dorito 
 Hotter than the peppers in your burrito 
 Getting cheddar and cream, if you know what I mean 
 (Verse 7: Childish Gambino) 
 Yeah, I know what you mean, home girl mistaken 
 She think Gambino won't bring home bacon 
 Or bring home Swiss cheese, my dough got holes 
 Cause all these hoes want shoes and nice clothes 
 They want the Macy's, the Neiman Marcus 
 The Fendi purses, the Gucci parkas 
 I know you want it, don't get me started 
 They see Gambino and they act retarded 
 Phat people do phat things 
 (Outro: Billy Scafuri) 
 Eat snacks, mother fucker, eat snacks 
 Eat snacks, mother fucker, eat snacks 
 Eat snacks coming out of packs 
 Guaranteed to put a little fat on your back 
 Eat snacks
