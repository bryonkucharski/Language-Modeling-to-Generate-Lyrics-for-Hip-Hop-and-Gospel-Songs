(Verse 1: Childish Gambino) 
 My name's Bambino, I'm always in trouble 
 I do stupid shit on a dare like double 
 Think your games tight, I'mma bust your bubble 
 I shop at Gucci and Barneys like rubble 
 Scope like Hubble, quick like chunnel 
 I leave MC's in the dark like tunnel 
 Men do huddles, girlfriends cuddle 
 Eh heh, all right 
 (Hook: Childish Gambino) 
 My hoodie on glow 
 My hoodie on glow 
 My hoodie on glow 
 My hoodie on glow 
 My hoodie, my my my hoodie on glow 
 My hoodie, my my my hoodie on glow 
 (Verse 2: Childish Gambino) 
 My hoodie so dope, my hoodie so tight 
 My hoodie in school cause my hoodie so bright 
 Welcome, my nigga, to color, Crayola 
 Got the bright purple, like a grape soda 
 Nigga I told you, my hoodie no joker 
 Walk up in the hoodie to a party like toga 
 Breathe like yoga, get off my scrotum 
 The color of my hoodie like a Lisa Frank folder 
 I'm at the Kid Robot, my wallet done shown up 
 They had five hoodies, but this shit done sold out 
 Spent too much, I know a bad habit 
 My hoodie look like a shit from a Trix rabbit 
 (Verse 3: Chaz Kangas) 
 Y'all know I'm a hoodie all pro 
 Find me in my hoodie like a hoodie Waldo 
 Rocking Amadeus like a hoodie falco 
 Staying self-absorbed like I'm Frida Kahlo 
 From the playground, with the sports team on it 
 To the old folks home, put some morphine on it 
 I rock my hoodie whether rain or shine 
 Over-priced in a Sam Goody frame of mind 
 Got a pouch in the front that holds my CDs 
 And warms my hands when it's too breezy 
 Believe me, the quickest way to get hurt 
 Is if I catch you calling it a hooded sweatshirt
