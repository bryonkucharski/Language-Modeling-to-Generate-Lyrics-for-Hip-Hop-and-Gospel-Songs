(Hook: Amber Petty) 
 Starlight 
 Where did you go? 
 I've been running around the world 
 Gotta let you know 
 (Verse 1: DC Pierson) 
 I got the empire state now I'm working on the next part 
 Trying to build an empire, I'm wishing on the Death Star 
 I murdered the dish, I eloped with the spoon 
 Tri-coastal and the third coast is the moon 
 When it hits your eye like a get in your eye thing 
 And we do the I like you like like you like like thing 
 I can't promise I won't be dressed like a viking 
 When I do the whole picking you up on my bike thing 
 Another white rapper's CD in my spokes 
 I would swear y'all converted to rap for the jokes 
 I spit black smoke, I'm the hip hop pope 
 They make anti-me PSA's 'cause I'm dope 
 And when it's not clear you can cope, the worlds a negative iPod 
 You just hear 'nope' 
 Nights on the pavement, you just stop breathin' 
 On some Liz Lemon movin' back to Cleveland 
 Street lights people, up and down the boulevard 
 Don't stop believin in your journey, and I know it's hard 
 They call me Violet Beauregard, 'cause I just blow up, no regard 
 All I really need is a bar to belly up to 
 A balcony, a star crossed lover to yell up to 
 So what are you up to? This weekend I'm free 
 Till then I'll just shine and let you find meExplain 
 (Verse 2: Childish Gambino) 
 I shine like the sun 
 My mouth is a gun, pop off and they run, two things like a pun 
 This is not just for fun and I cut with my tongue 
 My mouth's a Swiss army, take over your country 
 I run like a humvee, I don't need gas-o-line 
 I run on these rappers so skip the stromboli 
 I make these niggas say 'Great' like Tony 
 So how the fuck you gonna say these bitches don't know me? 
 How the fuck you gonna say these bitches don't know me 
 When you all on the tip of my dick like Moby 
 The wait is over, no baking soda 
 I saw them dudes move bricks and boulders 
 I saw them dudes move flats and corners 
 And they moved that sugar like Russell Stover 
 I got that green like a four leaf clover 
 Get rich or die tryin' like my name two quarters 
 Dope boys they get me, we got the same hustle till the tank on empty 
 And if you dope boy, better watch the Wire 
 And get the shit straight, turn back, retire 
 'Cause one in a mil turn snow to fire 
 You either move weight, play ball or neither 
 Because I'm neither, the hood Macgyver 
 The boy blew up like he knew Al Quaeda 
 My life so sweet that my balls Godiva 
 The world in front and the hood behind us 
 The hood behind us 
 Yeah 
 The hood behind us
