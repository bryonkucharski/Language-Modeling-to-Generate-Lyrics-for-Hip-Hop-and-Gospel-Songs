Uh, oh, mmm mmm mmm 
 She said, she said 
 Love me better, kiss me back, Listen more oh 
 Love me better, kiss me back, listen more 
 Love me better, kiss me back, listen more 
 Yeah, no no no 
 Face down in the brown grass 
 Shame shame on my brown ass 
 Birds in the trees as we run through 
 And if I'm dead to the world, what you gon' do? 
 What you gon' do? 
 Like, (I can't remember), Shot's fired, rewind, please girl be mine 
 Email denied, talk to me baby 
 Before we go crazy, might do it maybe 
 We were so Jay Z & Beyoncé, my aunt say "keep the sex game picante" 
 But Aunt May, the Mary Jane that I was hitting on 
 We were trying to forget there was something wrong 
 Love is Russian roulette, I had the safety on 
 We popped pills at the Coachella 
 Put my hand in the weeds, man I can't tell her 
 The fear that I feel man it might kill her 
 Man it might kill her, it's the prep school mic killa 
 With the drums and the groove so it feel Dilla 
 I don't care what he say 
 I'ma get my platinum back like I'm a half ton gorilla 
 You can hang, but homie, on the low 
 But your boy sound weak like a week ago 
 But we ain't speaking though 
 But we ain't speaking though 
 Tuesday afternoon, I ain't got shit to do 
 But fall in love with you 
 Tuesday afternoon, I ain't got shit to do 
 But fall in love with you 
 (She said, she said, she said) 
 Love me better, kiss me back, Listen more oh 
 Love me better, kiss me back, listen more 
 (She said, she said, she said) 
 Love me better, kiss me back, listen more 
 Yeah, no no no 
 The attitude, the attitude 
 I hope you understand 
 And I hope you understand 
 We were never and I hope you understand now 
 Gonna miss that 
 When that beat drop 
 Oh no no no 
 (I hope you understand) I hope you understand 
 'Cause everywhere I go 
 Everything I see 
 I just hope you understand 
 Won't let me call in the back 
 Why is he calling me black? 
 Why ain't you calling me back?
