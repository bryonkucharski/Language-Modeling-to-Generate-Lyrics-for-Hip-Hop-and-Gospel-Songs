There's a bottom to the top of a moment 
 You won't always be around 
 Catch a nigga coming quickly behind you 
 People want you underground 
 Do you misbehave? 
 Haunt you to your grave 
 I'm going to eat you alive 
 Please don't find me rude 
 But I don't eat fast food 
 So don't run to me 
 Just hide, ooh 
 You know that you're the one that's terrified, ooh 
 Just hide, ooh 
 You know that you're the one that's terrified, ooh 
 La, la, la, la, la 
 La, la, la, la, la 
 I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up 
 I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up 
 I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up 
 I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up 
 I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up 
 I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up 
 I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up 
 I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up 
 I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up 
 Just hide, ooh 
 You know that you're the one that's terrified, ooh 
 Just hide, ooh 
 You know that you're the one, that's terrified, ooh 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, please 
 Ooh-oh, no, no, no, ooh 
 Oh, you can't run from me 
 You can't hide from me
