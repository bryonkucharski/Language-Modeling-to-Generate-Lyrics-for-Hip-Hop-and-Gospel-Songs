With a gun in your hand 
 I'm the boogieman 
 I'm gonna come and get you 
 If you point a gun at my rising sun 
 Though we're not the one 
 But in the bounds of your mind 
 We have done the crime 
 Boogieman, you've got to help us, can you? 
 (Yes, I can) 
 Boogieman, you've got to help us, can you? 
 (Yes, I can) 
 With a gun in your hand 
 I'm the boogieman 
 I'm gonna come and get you 
 Every boy and girl all around the world 
 Knows my nigga's words 
 But if he's scared of me 
 How can we be free? Yeah 
 Boogieman, you've got to help us, can you? 
 (Yes, I can, oh) 
 Boogieman, you've got to help us, can you? 
 (Yes, I can, oh)
