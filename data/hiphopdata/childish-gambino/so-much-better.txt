I'm cooler than an ice cube, yeah I'm rude 
 'Bout to get your head sliced, yeah I'm nice 
 And you 'bout to pay the price 
 Like The Price Is Right, but I'm not Bob Parker 
 Yes, I get down like I'm Charlie Parker 
 Meaning that I'm musically inclined 
 If you try to get with mine I'm about to blow yo head back 
 Get another bullet and I spray bullet (bullet) 
 And I spray back, pop, pop, click, click (drop, drop) down 
 Now they lookin' for your body like all over the town 
 Niggas, my name Gambini, I used to be clean 
 Now I'm dirty martini, 'cause this boy met world like Feeny 
 These niggas make wishes like genie 
 Nigga you know how we do 
 Latinos, black people, and gringos 
 This money stained my fingers like Cheetos 
 Blast it out your speakers like keedoh 
 'Cause I can barely hold it all in like Speedos 
 These niggas got a lot of nerve 
 These niggas got a lot of speaks 
 And all these skinny bitches busy shop at Anthropologie 
 Who you tryin' to be? 
 I'mma take my girls to BIM and treat 'em like a VIP 
 Because I am a G, ugh (G, ugh) 
 I start the party like Chex Mix 
 Put it in your house like Netflix 
 Beat, nigga, it's what's for breakfast 
 Y'all niggas got beef with this kid 
 Y'all niggas' punks and stay punks like the Misfits 
 I'm way off in the distance 
 Y'all done lost the race like McCain 
 But like McCain, you used to be cool but now you lame 
 It's hard to maintain ain't it? 
 Because I am so much better (than before) 
 My swag is so sick, you might catch it 
 I'm tired of fuckin' 'round with little kids like I'm Brad Pitt 
 These little kids need to play in traffic 
 'Cause all they was was make a nigga giggle like mad-libs 
 I'm hot like an attic in the summer 
 And girls scream "Sick Boi" like we know each other 
 But we don't know each other, you ain't my fucking brother 
 We need to separate like organic peanut butter 
 My lightsaber flashing, my kneecaps ashyExplain 
 And girls of the world used to walk right past me 
 Now I hang with girls like my girl Kate Perry 
 I might have to marry Kate like my name Ashley 
 These rappers don't know what they up against 
 They can't see a nigga like my names Snuffleupagus 
 If you don't like my shit, why the fuck you bumpin' this? 
 I am so much better (than before) 
 You better get it clean good 'cause this the last straw 
 And break inside house and leave your gas on 
 Nigga, we NASA, 'cause we 'bout to blast off 
 Go in the bathroom, we see you peein' like I'm Shasta McNasty 
 Get it? UPN? Shasta McNasty? 
 Nigga, I'm a master 
 And I'm fucking plastered 
 I don't need a fucking beat for this, I can make my shit up 
 While I go here's the part that I'm about to show ya 
 I'm the best 'cause I gotta 
 The devils wears Prada 
 And he's got a boom boom like Welcome Back, Kotter 
 Leave your guy like my daughter 
 Got cheese like frittata, greed, and filata 
 Got ya, mama 
 Most rappers want the drama, but I don't want the drama 
 I just want a quiet night down at Benihana 
 I rap 'cause I gotta 
 Dude's got nada 
 I make 'em all proud like my middle name Obama
