You are the bestest, I will obey you 
 They wanna know what, I couldn't say who 
 You are the only one who's ever really seen me 
 I know that I'm the reason that you don't watch any tv 
 I wanna lay on your stomach so bad 
 And it gets a little quiet in this bachelor pad 
 And I don't really understand the thing we had 
 I wanna try again, but it would just be sad 
 And oh, oh whoa 
 You are the only one who's ever let me be me 
 We can make it easy 
 We can do it simple 
 I'll be waiting right there 
 Promise to be gentle 
 Sittin' by your window 
 Girl, you're so fly to me 
 So fly. Girl you're so fly 
 So fly. Girl you're so fly 
 So fly. Girl you're so fly to me 
 So fly. Girl you're so fly 
 So fly. Girl you're so fly 
 So fly. Girl you're so fly to me 
 We can make it easy 
 We can do it simple 
 I'll be waiting right there 
 Promise to be gentle 
 Sittin' by your window 
 Girl, you're so fly to me 
 So fly. Girl you're so fly 
 So fly. Girl you're so fly 
 So fly. Girl you're so fly to me 
 So fly. Girl you're so fly 
 So fly. Girl you're so fly 
 So fly. Girl you're so fly to me
