When the sun is rising over streets so barren 
 Since the evening, colors flash before my eyes 
 I feel like a child, so young and new in '92, I listen 
 To what my father said 
 Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall 
 If you are strong you cannot fall 
 There is a voice inside us all 
 So smile when you can, when you can 
 How this used to feel so far and free 
 Now these broken souls are all I see 
 Fists have fallen to our side 
 We may cry alone, I feel we know where all of this is headed 
 But my mama said 
 (Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall) 
 Oh I, nah, nah, nah 
 (If you are strong you cannot fall) 
 If you are strong 
 There is a voice inside us all 
 So smile when you can, when you can 
 If you cannot, oh 
 There is more to you and me 
 There is more than they can see 
 I'm on your side, wooh oh 
 There is more out there 
 And somebody cares 'bout you 
 I do 
 (Keep on your dreams, keep standing tall) 
 (If you are strong you cannot fall) 
 (Keep on your dreams, keep standing tall) 
 (If you are strong you cannot fall) 
 (Keep on your dreams, keep standing tall) 
 (If you are strong you cannot fall) 
 (Keep on your dreams, keep standing tall) 
 (If you are strong you cannot fall) 
 There is more out there 
 (Keep on your dreams, keep standing tall) 
 (If you are strong you cannot fall) 
 Oh 
 Give me morning, oh-oh-oh 
 When you're gone to yourself 
 Oh, oh!-Woo!-Yeah! 
 (Keep on your dreams, keep standing tall) 
 If you are strong you cannot fall) 
 Oh! Oh! 
 (Keep on your dreams, keep standing tall) 
 (If you are strong you cannot fall) 
 Thanks for doing that, thank you 
 Oh! Oh! 
 (Keep on your dreams, keep standing tall) 
 (If you are strong you cannot fall)
