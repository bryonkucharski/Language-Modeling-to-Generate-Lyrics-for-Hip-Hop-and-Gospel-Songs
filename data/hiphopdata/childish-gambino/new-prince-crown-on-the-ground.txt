I do not talk, I am just a rapper 
 Stompin' on these niggas like a whack-a-mole with no hands 
 Get girls on the floor like slow jams 
 Fuck yeah, I'm feelin' myself, no lotion 
 My light shine bright, no roaches 
 Nigga, I'm focused 
 You the one who eyes wrong 
 Only time I'm worried is when I'm the no-fly zone 
 'Cause I'm so fly, homes 
 Fresh like pinecones 
 Female phone book my iPhone 
 Margarita bright, meanin' limelight 
 Nerd girls losin' their shit like prom night 
 Mouth like a pussy, it can never be too tight 
 Let me guess, you know a better rapper, you, right? 
 Bam-B 
 Sicker than your grandma 
 Pass the mix-tape to a friend like Chandler 
 This track is gettin' over written 
 Sports night, Fanta 
 Tell 'em that you know me when you runnin' through Atlanta 
 I am at the top 
 Whether you want or not 
 And I am in my prime 
 I am an autobot 
 I do not talk a lot 
 I am just a rapper 
 Fuck a girl's pussy bright red like snapper 
 Sick 
 Yeah, I stay fly like a pelican 
 Get new kicks everyday like an ottoman 
 Ex-girlfriends askin' if they get a shot again 
 I try to call 'em back but there's a lot of them 
 Someone tell me why these muthafuckers busy hatin' me 
 Just because I'm rappin' and my style is kinda Japanese 
 Band of outsiders 
 Kitsune, APC 
 Macy's got shit on me 
 Fuck what you heard like a dick inside alarm clock 
 I ain't got no jewelry, I leave it at the pawn shop 
 Two of your chains equals one of my shirts, sir 
 You got Jacob's Jeweler, I got Anna Wintour 
 Niggas jealous 'cause I got more green than seven splinters 
 I'd rather spend that money on a polo from La Tigra 
 Young, smart, and handsome 
 Who could even ask for more? 
 I change the situation like auditioning for Jersey Shore 
 I'm the prince, put your crown on the ground (x7) 
 Oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh 
 Oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh 
 Sick 
 I'm the prince, put your crown on the ground (x7) 
 Oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh 
 Oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh 
 Sick
