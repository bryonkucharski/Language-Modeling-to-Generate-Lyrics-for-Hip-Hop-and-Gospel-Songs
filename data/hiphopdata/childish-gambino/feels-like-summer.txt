You can feel it in the streets 
 On a day like this, the heat 
 It feel like summer 
 I feel like summer 
 I feel like summer 
 You can feel it in the streets 
 On a day like this, the heat 
 I feel like summer 
 She feel like summer 
 This feel like summer 
 I feel like summer 
 Seven billion souls that move around the sun 
 Rolling faster, faster and not a chance to slow down 
 Slow down 
 Men who made machines that want what they decide 
 They're just tryna tell the children please slow down 
 Slow down 
 I know 
 Oh, I know you know that pain 
 I'm hopin' that this world will change 
 But it just seems the same 
 (It is not the same) 
 You can feel it in the streets 
 On a day like this, the heat 
 It feels like summer 
 I feel like summer 
 I feel like summer 
 You can feel it in the streets 
 On a day like this, that heat 
 I feel like summer 
 (I feel like summer) 
 I feel like summer 
 (I feel like summer) 
 Every day gets hotter than the one before 
 Running out of water, it's about to go down 
 Go down 
 Air that kill the bees that we depend upon 
 Birds were made for singing 
 Waking up to no sound 
 No sound 
 I know 
 Oh, I know you know my pain 
 I'm hopin' that this world will change 
 But it just seems the same 
 I know 
 Oh, I hope we change 
 I really thought this world would change 
 But it seems like the same 
 I know 
 Oh, my mind is still the same 
 I'm hoping that this world will change 
 But it just seems the same 
 I know 
 Oh, I hope we change
