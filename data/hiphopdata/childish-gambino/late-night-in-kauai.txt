One time I was at the beach 
 And we were looking at the stars 
 And this girl was laying next to me 
 And the blanket that we had was, had stars on it as well 
 It looked liked we were just floating in an abyss 
 Honestly, when I see her face I just smile I guess 
 I mean, our cars came and the lights were on on them so we could see what the waves look like 
 I'll be waiting here on the sand 
 I remember that first night you were wearing a power ranger black T-shirt 
 So was I, a different color, so was Moey and his brother 
 Not as pure, so insecure 
 The times have changed 
 But really we just looked up at the stars 
 For a couple hours, turned off all the lights on the cars 
 The world was ours it was, yours 
 It was mine 
 The time flew by like it was prime time and I'm inside of 
 Life, you shouldn't be my wife you should just be with me on this beautiful night 
 Maybe we can make things right 
 Maybe we can do it without any spite 
 It's just for tonight, and we hope it doesn't end 
 So we drive back to our homes chilling with our friends 
 Balling like Jabari Parker, they say I look like him 
 If we met bet it would be awkward break out the sudafed 
 Cause the flow cold, like it's so cold 
 I was smoking smoking John Lennon where my Yoko? 
 This that call yo grandma you ain't ready yet 
 Verbal maniac, imma show you the illest get my cousin to kill it 
 Had a flow but you steal it, I'm in the mood so we ball out 
 Got the top down in the back we could fall out 
 We could fall out, nigga we could fall out 
 Your girlfriend push a prius she giving me that genius 
 Mensa, we that Tony Danza 
 Wine on the rug man you know that shit expensive 
 I'm on that Willy Wonka, green so Blanka 
 Vape so good and the pot like lobster 
 Nigga imma monster, fuck it I'm a monstar 
 Man, I got this beat I'm going ham like a cop car 
 That's unless you see me pulling up on the boulevard 
 Turn them flashing lights, at least you know who you really are 
 We are becoming god 
 We are becoming god 
 We are becoming god 
 We are becoming god 
 We are becoming god 
 We are becoming god 
 We are becoming god 
 We are becoming god 
 We are becoming god 
 We are becoming god 
 I guess this ending's the best for me 
 But I can't leave you behind 
 You know that I never wanted to see what's on your mind 
 Goddamn, Goddamn Goddamn 
 Yo it's kinda hard not to like, get fucking cheesy on this shit 
 But, does that even matter? 
 You know what I'm saying, juxtaposition man, juxta fucking position 
 My nigga Jaden Smith dropping jewels and niggas don't believe him 'cause he's Jaden Smith but 
 It's all about packaging right? 
 Real shit though, good and bad is all relative man 
 It really is, a lot of niggas is sheep 
 We don't even know what we like anymore we just know what the most hype is shit 
 Do you really like that shit you like? 
 Or you like the way they gave it to you? 
 You know what I'm saying? Pepsi, Coca-Cola same thing 
 Dave Chapelle said that, the one that taste the best was the one that was paying him the most at the time 
 That's all that happens with us man, we some weak niggas man all of us 
 Followers, sheeps, plural made that shit up 
 Apology ain't no real word my nigga 
 We know this, but he knows more 'cause he broke the rules that don't even fucking exist man 
 Funny thing is man is like, as a futurist, and I can call myself a futurist 
 Nobody is even going to give a fuck until I'm gone 
 So does it even matter? 
 Yes it does
