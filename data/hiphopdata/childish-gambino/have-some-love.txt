Have a word for your brother 
 Have some time for one another 
 Really love one another 
 It's so hard to find 
 Have a word for your brother 
 Have some time for one another 
 Really love one another 
 It's so hard to find 
 You got the power, you got the power 
 Of every hour, of every hour 
 I come to getcha and I know where you are 
 I come to getcha and I know where you are 
 It's getting hot, it's like a sauna 
 Then every night in Arizona 
 They come to getcha when they grope in your mind 
 They think you creepy, getting down in your mind 
 They come to getcha, they come to getcha 
 It doesn't matter, you making magic 
 I got the business to make a mind 
 I got the business to make a mind 
 And if you feel it, if you feel in your toes 
 And you act nothing like nobody knows 
 But if you want it, you got to want it 
 Have a word for your brother 
 Have some time for one another 
 Really love one another 
 It's so hard to find 
 Have a word for your brother 
 Have some time for one another 
 Really love one another 
 It's so hard to find, have a word 
 Come on baby, oh 
 Darling no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no 
 That's right baby, that's right 
 I see wherever, wherever, wherever you are 
 (Wherever, wherever, wherever you are) 
 I see wherever, wherever, wherever you are 
 (Wherever, wherever, wherever you are) 
 Wherever, wherever, wherever you are 
 (Wherever, wherever, wherever you are) 
 Do no wrong now 
 That's right, baby 
 There's a big wide world out there, I need to get in 
 We have got to bring this thing together (we gotta stay together) 
 And I hope and I pray, we will find it someday 
 We have got to really stay together (are we stayin'?), so- 
 Have a word for your brother 
 Have some time for one another 
 Really love one another 
 It's so hard to find 
 Have a word for your brother 
 Have some time for one another 
 Really love one another 
 It's so hard to find
