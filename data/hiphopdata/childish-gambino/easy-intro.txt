Sick bois don't die, they fresh to death 
 My shoes bright blue, so you watch my step 
 My hoody hot pink with the hat to match 
 So you ain't gotta know where my paper at 
 Pop tags 'cause I'm filthy, apes can bathe me 
 My home is the dirty but I shine like crazy 
 My hat tag up and it hang off slightly 
 My game 8-bit so you niggas can bite me 
 Nike like me cause my life is great 
 I'm married to the game, we should consummate 
 Brand new hoodies the color of light sabers 
 My name ain't Luke, but that dude date Leias 
 With fly ass sneakers 
 Bump them speakers 
 Pump this groove till your ear start bleedin' 
 White girls shake it till the black dudes notice 
 Black girls shake it so you can regain focus 
 Swag it out, swag it out 
 Let's get one thing straight, I'm no average rapper 
 Born in SoCal, then I hit Atlanta 
 Then to New York, I'm an army brat 
 And I learn new things all across the map 
 In Cali I was small taught need to be strong 
 And Atlanta had the hawk so I learned how to ball 
 New York had Starks on the New York Knicks 
 So when they came around I had my first round pick 
 And now I'm so sick that they call me Ebola 
 Sick girls all on my pole like totem 
 Life is a gamble, your boy done told 'em 
 Play your cards right like it's Texas hold 'em 
 Bounce dem shoulders, go ahead Bankhead 
 I can do it better even though I'm stone mountain 
 Georgia's on my mind, but I live in New York 
 So I got Southern Drawl and I limp when I walk 
 They used to say a nigga lame when I started to rap 
 No them fake fuck niggas askin' me for a track 
 Pokin' me on facebook tryin' to be my friend 
 Nigga you get your face took you ask me one more 'gain 
 I'm a genius, why they call the shit G-mail man 
 This is my space nigga, you can't make top ten
