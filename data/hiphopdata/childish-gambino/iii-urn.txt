I watch them all pass by 
 The moon and the stars 
 Let me hold you in my arms 
 Forever more 
 These cold nights 
 The park is ours 
 Standing by the side 
 Let you go, oh to the sea, just for me 
 Don't ever let me, my love 
 Keep holding on 
 Let the modest go 
 As my mic goes to and fro 
 Waking up for one more show 
 We see him in the night 
 Tell him I'm not afraid of him 
 I'm not afraid of them 
 'Cause I won't know
