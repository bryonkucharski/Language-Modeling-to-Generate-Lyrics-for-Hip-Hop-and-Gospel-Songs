You're the only girl that I have ever wanted 
 Every other girl is trying to be you 
 My mama says that I should write you letters 
 But I think you're with other dudes 
 Take my hand, you'll like it 
 You don't even have to call 
 Yes I've had some alcohol, I'm sorry 
 Take my hand 
 You don't even have to call 
 You're somewhere out there after all 
 You're all I ever wanted 
 You're all I ever wanted 
 You're all I ever wanted
