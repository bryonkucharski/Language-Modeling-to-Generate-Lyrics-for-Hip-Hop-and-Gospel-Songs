She text me today 
 She said she hate me 
 She's not the first 
 She probably won't be the last 
 I don't give a fuck 
 I came here to do my own shit 
 I came here to do my own shit 
 No fucks given 
 No fucks given 
 What you know about me 
 No one else can do it like me 
 No one else can do it like me 
 I was checking I.D 
 She don't look 18 
 She don't know 18, no 
 I was doing my thing 
 You know I was tossing that green 
 We ain't even on the same team 
 We ain't even hit her with the real shit 
 I'mma show these mother fuckers you ain't really seem real 
 Aaw, I'mma do it for the real niggas 
 When them boys ain't feeling ya 
 Real only see real nigga 
 Heard of Bino man that boy amazing 
 You don't hear me cause a nigga blazing, blazing 
 Oh you don't want a problem 
 You don't want yo' man to solve 'em, naw 
 I'm killin' these niggas off a mixtape 
 And most these niggas out been fake 
 Me and my niggas all homeless 
 We ain't hear shit that y'all told us 
 We was getting money, you ain't getting money 
 All we did was study, all we did was study 
 We don't give a fuck about status 
 Girls and you know I got baddest 
 Just cut her off, she the saddest 
 Wish a nigga would like Aladdin 
 No chill, dress code I'm like "oh well" 
 She ain't seen my hotel 
 Man them numbers don't bode well 
 War is hell 
 This ain't war but I'm beefin' nigga, my ether nigga, wooh 
 I don't fuck with the fake shit 
 More green than a spaceship 
 We don't fuck with y'all, no way 
 Y'all ain't got no taste 
 Rap is not bold face 
 Now we in the mix 
 If you broke we can fix it 
 Sayin' I ain't doing things, look at this shit 
 Look at this shit, look at this shit
