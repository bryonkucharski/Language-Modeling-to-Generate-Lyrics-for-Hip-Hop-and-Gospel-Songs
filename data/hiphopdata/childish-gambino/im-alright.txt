This is exactly what I wanted 
 All my fans love me 
 Dad is proud of me 
 Momma cries for me 
 'Cause she know there ain't sleep in my schedule 
 Having nightmares that I'm the black Heath Ledger 
 Sleep when I'm dead 
 These voices in my head 
 Got me waking up at 4 just so I can write instead 
 And my friends come and ask me if it's worth it 
 I tell them that it better be, I did this shit on purpose 
 The worst is being worthless 
 Now a nigga priceless 
 Bloomingdales coat, I don't have to check the prices 
 But I only go to feel a sense of control 
 'Cause I get this shit for free if I wear promotional 
 And I'm not emotional 
 When I do my work 
 I get emotional when I order that dessert 
 'Cause she always ate dessert 
 And I deserted her 
 But I refuse to compromise career for a girl 
 Cause this music and this writing and this acting is my soul 
 And if I let it go, there'd be no one left to know 
 Being happy is the goal, but greatness is my vision 
 And all these girls are thinking they compete with my ambition 
 But baby I am different 
 This shit is my life 
 And if you don't believe me, you can never be wife 
 I'm walking in this darkness and I'm tryna find a light 
 And I'd rather die than be average and chances are I might, because 
 Things are changing, my life ?????? 
 Thirteen cities in the last eight weekends 
 All I know is baby I'm so tired 
 Record on Monday, 
 Tape on Tuesday, 
 I ain't slowing down I don't care what you say 
 Fuck this health thing, Momma I'm all right
