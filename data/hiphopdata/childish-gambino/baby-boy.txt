Little hands, little feet 
 Tiny heart, tiny beat 
 Oh, thinkin' 'bout the time we spent 
 Falling in love together 
 I don't wanna leave you 
 I don't wanna deceive you 
 But oh, when mama cries from daddy's lies 
 Oh my, please don't take him away, mama 
 Don't take him away, oh 
 'Cause I've had my time, oh 
 Don't take my baby boy 
 Don't take my pride and joy 
 I hope I stay close, I hope I stay close 
 All the pain, all the tears 
 Many nights, many years 
 This love for me is fading 
 You waited, but I never came home to you 
 I've never lied about us 
 We were never supposed to be together 
 When you see me with some other one 
 And they know your son 
 Oh, please don't take him away 
 You said you won't but you will, yes you will 
 'Cause I've had my time, oh 
 Don't take my baby boy 
 Don't take my pride and joy 
 I hope I stay close, I hope I stay close 
 (Don't take my baby boy) 
 There was a time before you 
 And there will be a time after you 
 (Don't take my pride and joy) 
 Though these bodies are not our own 
 (I hope I stay close) 
 Walk tall, little one, walk tall 
 (Don't take my baby boy) 
 (Don't take my pride and joy) 
 Let me hold you, let me hold you 
 (I hope I stay close) 
 Can I hold you?
