This that, fire! 
 It's your man Bambino, Sick Boi thriller 
 King of fly rappers, there ain't none iller 
 I'm into fly sneakers, colors like Gullies 
 So if you don't know me by now: "You's a dummy" 
 It's the Sick Boi anthem, girls take your coats off 
 Get the champagne, pop the cork like Sosa 
 Make some mimosas, get like me 
 Spanish girls holla say, "Aye papi" 
 Ooh la la, on the French Riviera 
 These other boys sandals, straight club benders 
 We some go-getters, you should know better 
 Your girl think 'bout me while she drivin' a Jetta 
 Used to blast Kelly Clarkson, now she a sick girl 
 Hot pink shirt and them lime green sneakers 
 Take a quick picture, put me on blast 
 Call the fireman, he need to come fast 
 I'm on fire 
 They call me Sick Boi 'cause they know I'm so sick 
 Purple on my starter cap, yellow on my kicks 
 Haters talkin' shit, they think they so slick 
 And if you don't like my style: "Eat a dick" 
 I'm a younger Denzel, say it ain't so 
 I'm all puffed up like I'm made of afros 
 But my neck ain't froze, where's the boy's jewelery? 
 Don't need it nigga, clothes bright, shine beautifully 
 Used to sport Airs then I had to get Grind 
 Now I look great, now I'm top of the line 
 Used to go hungry when I'd buy them new shoes 
 Now I'm like "Mm... food" like MF Doom 
 Busy makin' moves like my name was Tetris 
 Money in the bank, you can check my mattress 
 Bright like Mantis and I ain't selfish 
 I got the game shook like a young black Elvis 
 Fire
