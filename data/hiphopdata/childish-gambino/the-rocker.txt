Uh, they call me the rocker 
 Uh, yeah, uh-huh, uh 
 They call me the rocker 
 I get down like 2Pac and Big Poppa 
 Some say he too birds, you can't stop him 
 Niggas got too much beef like two Whoppers 
 Look at my clockers, it's about time 
 For a nigga to mature like a glass of fine wine 
 Ain't no nigga alive can outshine 
 I get sneaks, but don't pay like I'm crime 
 I run this bitch, 'cause I'm Will Smith 
 'Cause I am legend and you just Hitch 
 Naw, I'm Hitch 
 'Cause I get bitchesExplain 
 Well, I got more than one so call me eight Hitches 
 We ain't got riches, just some nice kicks 
 So call me Bruce Lee who's dressed in nice shit 
 Haters think I'm lame and girls think I'm sick 
 But both of them groups is riding my dick 
 Yeah, they call me the rocker 
 Call me Mr. Gambino 
 Uh-huh, check this out 
 I'm fly like birds and I spit real shit so my flow like turds 
 And my words absurd so I turn it all around 
 So my mouth is my ass and I sit when I'm loud 
 And I'm black and I'm proud 
 And I'm white and I'm rich 
 So fuck it, I'm a martian, I'm Lilo and Stitch 
 Niggas say I sound like Weezy and shit 
 Well he the best in the game so what's wrong with that? 
 Are you trying to tell me that my rhymes is phat? 
 Call me Usain Bolt 'cause I run the track 
 Nigga I'm sick of that 
 Stop comparing me to people 
 I know my voice funny like my name John Heder 
 And I'm out of this world and I'm hot like space heaters 
 And my girl top down so I call her two seater 
 My iPhone blast like TNT 
 I text back to home girl, "What you know 'bout me?" 
 I'm in NYC or in ATL 
 And my wallet stay fat like Kenan plus Kel 
 Nigga what's that smell, cause my shit don't stink 
 Cause my shirt bright blue and my shoes hot pink 
 And I finish this drink that I call a Twin Tower 
 Two Bud Lights and a whiskey sour 
 Where I fall down, that shit is ground zero 
 Little kids saying, "There goes my hero!" 
 Hahahaha 
 They call me the rocker, nigga! 
 Uh, they call me the rocker 
 Yo I'm out man
