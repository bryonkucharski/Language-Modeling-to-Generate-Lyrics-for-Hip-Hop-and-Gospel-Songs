I ain't your ordinary nigga 
 Look around, this ain't what ordinary gets ya 
 I ain't your ordinary nigga 
 Look around, this ain't what ordinary gets ya 
 Gam-B, the one like Neo 
 You didn't see it coming 
 Reverse Miss Cleo 
 I'm C-P30 
 Or better yet Anakin 
 When it comes to lightsaber's that I'm handlin 
 I used to be king of the whack look 
 Now I stay king of the mac book 
 Yes mac book, where you write your numbers down 
 Yeah boy, I got girls in and out of town 
 You got it wrong like saying OJ;IJ 
 Stop the rumors 
 Asian girls don't got sideways 
 I gotta fuck every shade of latte 
 I gotta flow like my mouth to Kanye's 
 These niggas think that I'm playing, I ain't saying nothing 
 I'll fuck your girl on the burner 
 I'm so top stuffing 
 You can't stop nothing, I'm the juggernaut 
 That's why your B's sweet on me like I'm butterscotch 
 Yeah we run a lot 
 Boy the track runners here 
 I'm Elroy we jet sun out the atmosphere 
 Let me make it clear 
 I'm your inner fear 
 And I'm taking over, please don't interfere 
 Uh I'm the streets desire 
 Your getting too old man, please retire 
 Don't make me carry you like I'm liar liar 
 Bring the heat like a monster, I'm Elmo's fire 
 I'm too busy spittin' shit with a socialite 
 I'm too busy sittin' bitch with some model types 
 Yes sir my girl's look like Rihanna twice 
 With some packed bags, yeah, they ain't going home tonight 
 Get your camera phone, prove ya seen me 
 Or else you'll be with friends like "Please believe me!" 
 I'm all that, I'm Kel and Kenan 
 Nigga, I come hard like I'm filled with semen 
 These rappers bore me 
 Gun talk with black clothes 
 Y'all let me know when y'all let 1998 go 
 Y'all niggas scared to grow 
 I'm never scared to go 
 Anywhere that's new, I go outside, y'all niggas stay at home 
 But that's all right dude 
 I'm a special guy 
 Y'all been wanting to rap since you were ankle high 
 And I've been wanting to rap since like what, 05? 
 Do the math man, how are you one of the best alive? 
 Gam-B, yes me, best out there 
 Trying to get universal like healthcare 
 So fresh, so clean, like a new pair 
 When you get to the top what you do there?
