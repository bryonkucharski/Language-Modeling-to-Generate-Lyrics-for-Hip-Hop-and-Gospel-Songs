I am the shit 
 I hold heat like cigarettes 
 No one else is doing this 
 Work this hard you get respect 
 I don't sleep, I dream awake 
 Swear this life's like make or break 
 I don't make I fix mistakes 
 Your life good, my life is great 
 This game is a bitch and I'm different, dude 
 I'm tryin' to fuck this bitch, she ain't in the mood 
 Seduce her quick 
 Everyone talkin' bout game needs change ain't changin' shit 
 Talk don't make it happen 
 I do not talk, I am just a rapper 
 Too tight need muscle relaxer 
 I'm what's next, just ask 'em 
 All I know 
 It's what I came for 
 Glory, glory, glory, glory, glory, yeah 
 I wanna do this right 
 Leave my heart on stage when I hold a mic 
 And the game OT, no end in sight 
 So I write in my sleep, I don't say good night 
 This must be how the angels felt 
 I hope that I don't Corey Haim myself 
 I know that I drink an insane amount 
 'Cause it helps with the joy and the pain of wealth 
 These guys don't seem like the friends I need 
 And they hang backstage drinking beers for free 
 My mom and my dad in the balcony 
 The one time that I hope they look down on me 
 'Cause they proud of me 
 They call me a role model 
 Even though my hand's glued to that gin bottle 
 I keep my career going full throttle 
 Even though the pain will follow 
 All I know 
 It's what I came for 
 Glory, glory, glory, glory, glory, yeah
