Uh uh 
 Yeah we gon' get it 
 Yeah 
 Uh uh 
 Oh no no no 
 We can go together 
 It doesn't really matter 
 We can get there 
 We can do it if we try 
 You know that I love you 
 Put no one else above you 
 We can get there 
 We can do it if we try 
 Young Bino in the house like an B&E 
 Why I'm looking so fly 
 I'm just being me 
 Moved up, weed 
 In my girl clutch 
 White girls so 
 The twelve ain't never really searched 
 Smoke cars, swear to god 
 Need a bigger purse 
 Royalty, I'm the boss, we ain't gotta work 
 Lay it out on the island 
 She Hawaiian, wonder if she let me slide in 
 The OG making noise like a firetruck 
 Flew in, touched down 
 Then we light 'em up 
 I've been saying that the clique 
 There's alot of us 
 Talk shit 
 But nobody else ontop of us 
 Got popular 
 This the real shit 
 Get ... in the face 
 With a full clip 
 Get ... in the aim 
 Niggas don't slip 
 Then get ... 
 With the case just for sellin' it 
 I know them gorillas 
 I hang with them killers 
 They paint 'em as villains 
 When really they livin' 
 We got abroad 
 This is world war three 
 I'm the new Jay-Z 
 I ain't write shit down 
 I'mma steal that crown 
 I'mma do that thing 
 Girl you sweeter than mango 
 How we cool and confident 
 With hair like Django 
 How we walk in the room 
 And the girls they notice 
 'Cause they know you bogus 
 I'm the man you noticed 
 And... 
 We can go together 
 It doesn't really matter 
 We can get there 
 We can do it if we try 
 You know that I love you 
 Put no one else above you 
 We can get there 
 We can do it if we try 
 I'mma show you how to do this 
 It's easy when you 
 Let go, let go 
 Didn't mean to make you nervous 
 The booty lookin' retro retro 
 You can be the moon to me 
 And I can be your spotlight (spotlight) 
 And if you think I'm ballin' 
 You shoulda seen me last night, last night 
 Fuck that, fuck y'all and the po-po's 
 Down under, surfin' on the gold coast 
 I'm looking for the truth in a blunt 
 And I ain't got a home 
 Let's stunt 
 So baby if you feel like you wanna leave 
 I ain't afraid to drop a couple skymiles 
 The game ain't easy 
 We both deserve a little bit of timeout 
 We can go together 
 It doesn't really matter 
 *Cough* 
 Oh 
 Yeah 
 'Kay, one, two, three, go! 
 Oh, hey 
 Oh, hey, ah 
 Are we done?
