When we were coming down, they said it was too soon 
 I never had to lie, no, no, no, no 
 We were coming down, they left us all alone 
 Way to nowhere, nowhere, I know you've been around 
 I feel you in and out, how are you? 
 Do you sleep? Are you with me? 
 We used to be unspoken 
 Now everything is broken 
 I'm a good son 
 You're a good son 
 You're a good son 
 Arlanda, hotel to the bar 
 Young girl with an accent with her back bent 
 Ass out to the whole world 
 We can buy it out for tonight 
 Stepping outside for a light 
 No coke and I just smoke vapor, no papers 
 Slow poke and I don't know about photos 
 Let's go though 
 How old are you? 
 Saying that you never date older dudes 
 Why I never wanna say no to you 
 The coldest dude to hold a grove with no kids 
 Can't hold his goose 
 I'ma walk out, wanna walk too? 
 What about dude? 
 Fuck it, I just wanna feel something 
 It took me like five minutes to figure out what voices those were 
 On the phone, but it figured it out 
 Is it real, 'cause you're online 
 Is it real, 'cause you're online 
 Is it real, 'cause you're online 
 Is it real, 'cause you're online 
 I'm a freaky bitch 
 I'm 5 foot 8. 390 
 And I am a freaky bitch 
 Heathen 
 It's a struggle just to keep breathing 
 Existential asthmatic, puff puff pass addict 
 Crafmatic, making moves but they sleeping on me 
 We can kick it like it's FIFA, homie 
 Nevertheless, I got that fresh like it was Crest 
 Crying 'cause I'm stressed. TMJ or TMI 
 It's a lie that you're living 
 I never understood the hate on a nigga preference 
 When every marriage is a same sex marriage 
 Same sex everyday, monotonous 
 Lost God never pray, forgotten us 
 Lost love, never say just like our parents 
 Too much power ain't enough power 
 Brain splattered like I've fallen off a watchtower 
 Any anybody can walk into any Denny's 
 And wait until I'm walking in it with a gun that they 3D printed and I finish it 
 Kinison said if you gonna miss heaven 
 Why do it by two inches? 
 Old money and new bitches
