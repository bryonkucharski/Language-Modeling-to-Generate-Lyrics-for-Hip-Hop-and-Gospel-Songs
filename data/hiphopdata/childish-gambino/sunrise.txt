Yeah nigga, it's me again 
 I'm still around, I guess I win 
 You hear me in your sister's room like all the time 
 Gambino Girl forever on that bracelet that she bought online 
 To dudes who couldn't take it, might I say, "hasta luega" 
 'Cause I'm taking all your city like I'm Carmen San Diego 
 I amm smoking, I'm on fire 
 I am blazin', don't get hurt 
 To my white dudes it's a concert 
 To my black nerds this is church 
 From that NYU dorm to the Emirate 
 Everyone hated me, I'm more hip hop than you'll ever be 
 I'm bustin', bustin' bustin', I'm bustin' on these niggas man 
 And nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' is the same again 
 You lookin' dumb as hell man for ever sleeepin' on him 
 Your girl is not around, she busy sleepin' on him 
 Will he fail? 
 Now that's the wrong conversation 
 Terry Gross on the mic, I'm the talk of the nation, hah 
 Hey, what it do bitch? 
 Why these other rappers do shit stupid? 
 While they be sleepin' I be onto that new shit 
 While they be sleepin' I be onto that new shit 
 Hey, what it do bitch? 
 Why these other rappers do shit stupid? 
 While they be sleepin' I be onto that new shit 
 While they be sleepin' I be onto that new shit 
 New shit 
 You didn't know? 
 Black rock like a fuckin' Lost episode 
 Somethin' for these black kids to call they own 
 So when you skatin' in your driveway, you not alone 
 She stay down like that new coat that I bought her 
 And the fly Rihanna girls be drinkin' my coconut water 
 And I'm lookin' at her butt 
 That's that 20/20 hindsight 
 My shit be Jackson, Jordan, Bolton, Keaton, Tyson: 5 Mikes 
 Donald Glover, no relation 
 Always workin', no vacation 
 They couldn't feel me, novacation 
 Murder verses the only motive was motivation 
 Money equals freedom 
 I've wanted this since a three-year-old 
 I've seen it all, like I'm John Mayer's penis hole 
 Bein' me, that's something that's so unusual 
 I've seen the future, and the future go 
 Hey, what it do bitch? 
 Why these other rappers do shit stupid? 
 While they be sleepin' I be onto that new shit 
 While they be sleepin' I be onto that new shit 
 Hey, what it do bitch? 
 Why these other rappers do shit stupid? 
 While they be sleepin' I be onto that new shit 
 While they be sleepin' I be onto that new shit 
 Can't you hear me baby? 
 Can't you hear me callin' out your name? 
 Can't you hear me baby? 
 Oh, can't you hear me callin' out your name?
