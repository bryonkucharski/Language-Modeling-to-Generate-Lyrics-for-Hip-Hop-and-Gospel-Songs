Cooler than Coolio, stay in the studio 
 Flyer than Peter Pan when I'm pushin' that Rufio 
 It's that Stone Mountain CEO, wishin' that you was me 
 Girls on the tour bus, keep that ratio two or three 
 Fly as I want, A-Town put 'em up 
 East side till I die, Like we don't give a fuck 
 Keep your mouth so shut, talk is cheap 
 'Bino been here, y'all been sleep 
 'Bino hot and we know this 
 Fuck the rest, we've been chosen 
 Keepin' up with these Joneses 
 Still stunt with these hoes-es 
 So street like Elmo, so street like Elmo 
 'Bino ain't the coldest Man, you funny like my elbow 
 Always on some other shit, stupid like my type of rich 
 Damn, what kind of life is this? I'm driven like some licenses 
 Let they head nod when the beat go in 
 I'mma wait till the beat go in 
 You so sophisticated 
 Shout out to those who hated 
 Kill a rapper, try to spit at me, that's suicide 
 Gambino forever, and Royalty is do or die 
 I'mma wait till the beat go in 
 Shotgun, blast that when I pass through 
 When I do things in that UK, and I fucks mane with that Flux mane 
 Bino flow so honest, your check ain't got no commas 
 But I ain't got no worries like Adele my baby mama 
 I'm blown off that indo, blown off that indo 
 Told y'all I would blow up that shit happened like I said so 
 You see it, I got it 
 I want it, I buy it 
 I do it, you tryin' 
 This yo girl? You lyin' 
 Let they head nod when the beat go in 
 I'mma wait till the beat go in 
 You so sophisticated 
 Shout out to those who hated 
 Kill a rapper, try to spit at me, that's suicide 
 Gambino forever, and Royalty is do or die 
 I'mma wait till the beat go in 
 I'mma wait till the beat go in 
 Let they head out when the beat go in 
 I'mma wait till the beat go in
