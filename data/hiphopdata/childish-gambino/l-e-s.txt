Baby, you're the baddest 
 Baby, you're the baddest girl and uh 
 Nobody else matters 
 Nobody else matters girl and uh 
 We're kissing in the bathroom 
 We're kissing in the bathroom girl and uh 
 I hope nobody catch us 
 But I kinda hope they catch us 
 Anyway 
 A new york nine's an everywhere-else six 
 Timewise, the opposite goes for chicks 
 I'm in a taxi, texting with my best friend 
 He's sleepin' with this girl that he met up on west end 
 He's lucky, she's a career woman, no kids 
 Most girls see the clothes and try and gold dig 
 Most hoes poke holes in trojans 
 Most people don't fuckin' hit the lotto but my folks did 
 I'm a mess 
 That don't rhyme with shit, it's just true 
 Don't bring your girlfriend here, it's just you 
 When I'm depressed you're someone I run to 
 But, I guess meet me at pianos 
 And cross-fadin' off of nanos 
 Ugh, on that hipster shit 
 And you's a hipster, bitch 
 Yo, but not in the lame way 
 Like, you ain't livin' out in bk 
 Like, you ain't workin' on a screenplay 
 Like, your baby daddy ain't a DJ 
 Like, she listenin' to old freeway 
 Cause everybody listens to biggie, but she different 
 Right, that's why your friends need wristbands? 
 Fuck you 
 And can I have this dance? 
 We could pretend if you want to, like 
 We in love and started datin' after art school 
 Cause either way we both lyin' more than half of the time 
 Except for when I'm home workin' on your graphic design 
 Everytime we see each other I'm takin' you home 
 Our relationship has gotten sylvester stalone 
 Yellow 9/11 persian girl in the back car 
 But me writin' a verse the only way they buyin' a bar 
 White boys used to trip and send me over a gin 
 But they busy showin' off each other Indian friend 
 She got ironic tattoos on her back 
 That ain't ironic bitch, I love rugrats 
 Watchin' lames handle they fame 
 They bang any broad with bangs 
 In a band with an animal name 
 Hannibal came drinkin' a handle of jameson 
 Anallin' anyone is the plan for the evening 
 I'm kidding, stop 
 Girl cryin' on ludlow 
 She still look good though 
 Love is eastside, who are you to hate? 
 Movie ass, not a 10 but a super 8 
 You ain't see me at the show, I was super great 
 Hotel penthouse, go on and let it roominate 
 City never sleeps, so I guess I'm never slept on 
 Did everything I could, then I kept goin' 
 Ooh girl, I wanna know 
 Are you ready to cry, 'cause I'm no good, no good 
 Ooh girl, I wanna try 
 I'm an awful guy and I'm always away 
 And I'm tryin' to say 
 I'mma piece of shit 
 Believe in this 
 I'm tellin' you 
 'Cause we barely knew, what we had 
 I'm not that bad, the fun we had 
 Ooh
