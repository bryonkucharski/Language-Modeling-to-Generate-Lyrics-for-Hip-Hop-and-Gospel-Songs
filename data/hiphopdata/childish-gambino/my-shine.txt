Runnin' through the moment as the sun goes down 
 And all I ever wanted was to hear that sound 
 I stunt hard 
 I make it work (Yeah) 
 I make it work (Yeah) 
 I live large 
 I make it work (Yeah) 
 I make it work (Yeah) 
 Chyeah 
 Childish Gambino, lame niggas never heard of it 
 Sickboy is the crew, fuck these niggas with a dirty dick 
 When these motherfuckers gonna understand I'm serious? 
 I'm hard in the paint like I fuck her on a period 
 James Dean swag, leather jacket, white t-shirt 
 Rolled-up sleeves, nigga looking like a greaser 
 Word is born, baby, my dictionary's in labor 
 Listen to the Culdesac and know that was an ultimatum 
 Man, why nobody wanna admit they like me just a little bit? 
 Won't be on the Freshmen list, guess I'll just keep spitting shit 
 Never be the rapper with six hundred dollar shades 
 No iced-out chain, Rod Lavers all day 
 I was hoping they would see me just for me, dope rhymer 
 They do me like my first house, no co-signer 
 See you using qualifiers, you don't even know 
 "I guess he good for a rapper who on a TV show!" 
 Even though, I was rappin' back when Lance had chemo, ho 
 Even flow, Pearl Jamming niggas can't leave me alone 
 I keep a bone for these girls who liked me back when green was low 
 Feel me, though, DVR my thoughts and make your TiVo grow 
 Runnin' through the moment as the sun goes down 
 (Starlight, starlight) 
 And all I ever wanted was to hear that sound 
 (All night, all night) 
 But it's all for you to prove it 
 Keep on movin', keep on usin' 
 My shine 
 My shine, my shine 
 Oh-uh-a-oh 
 Ooh, take me higher (Higher, higher) 
 (Oh) 
 Ooh, take me higher (Higher, higher) 
 Gambeezy make it work something, let me check the syntax 
 Don't add an eezy to my name, 'cause it has never been that 
 Aladdin on you fuckers, prince of the game from streetrat 
 Dudes fall off, too steep like tea bags 
 Steady moving, don't worry about where I'ma be 
 'Cause I'ma be on these tracks like indie girls on Amelie 
 Honesty, I'm rapping 'bout everything I go through 
 Everything I'm saying, I'm Super Saiyan like Goku 
 Fuck nerdcore, fuck backpack 
 Fuck rap cool, I make cool rap 
 I make music for wack blacks to blast back 
 In fact, I swear the track I lie on's my last track 
 Runnin' through the moment as the sun goes down 
 (Starlight, starlight) 
 And all I ever wanted was to hear that sound 
 (All night, all night) 
 But it's all for you to prove it 
 Keep on movin', keep on usin' 
 My shine 
 My shine, my shine 
 Oh-uh-a-oh 
 Runnin' through the moment as the sun goes down 
 (Starlight, starlight) 
 And all I ever wanted was to hear that sound 
 (All night, all night)
