 Situations will arise, in our lives 
 But you gotta be smart about it 
 Celebrations, with the guys 
 I sacrificed, cause you could not sleep without it 
 Girl I, 'cause I loved you 
 You were my girl 
 See I, thought the world of you 
 But so you know 
 You don't have to call baby no 
 Cause imma be all right tonight 
 You don't have to call baby no 
 Imma be all right tonight 
 My man 
 I waited, I waited, and waited 
 For the phone call 
 And then I served you what she was asking for 
 Nah, you ain't gotta make that call now 
 Stone Mountain, yeah, you started running that thing after us 
 We are very rare 
 10% of a foster home trying to Cinderella this shit 
 This melanin pit they placed us in and said get out 
 No blueprint, hell's cruiseship 
 Took him and her, who made him and her 
 Who made him and her who made her 
 Who ran away from the south at 14 pregnant 
 Who made her who came back to the south 
 Atlanta, Georgia who made me 
 Funny hairline, white name 
 Blonde dreads, African name, both of our parents 
 Original black hippies, so what? 
 Little 5 point to Avondale to Stone Crest 
 You out in Lithonia though 
 But fuck that, I'm a high class nigga 
 I catch you out at Lenox 
 Nah fuck that, I'm looking for hoes at Atlantic Station 
 Nah fuck that, I'm at South DeKalb Mall 
 Really in the parking lot, leaning on some broke niggas Camry 
 The pic you sent last night says you really with the shits 
 My leather passenger seat exhales 
 Wasn't ready for all that 
 'Cause it's not me 
 I mean who is right? 
 Imma take you to Tongue and Groove 
 There's $20 to wear my hat inside 
 I give 'em $100 and tell 'em to pay for it for the niggas behind me 
 They playing Jeezy like that shit came out yesterday 
 Thug motivation, I was never a thug and they used to respect me for it 
 But now the game's fucked up and I gotta Michael Coreleone these niggas 
 Quiet, confident, I talked to her 
 She came with you, but she left with me 
 And now she's in the passenger seat 
 So, where we going? 
 Just the way 
 Which leaves you standing there thinking 
 You don't have to call, baby
