Childish Gambino, yeah, I got that swagger 
 Yeah, I hate her mad but it just don't matter 
 These girls all know that I got that cheddar 
 But it on a sandwich and eat it off a platter 
 My mouth vacationin', chillin' on her lawn 
 It's amazing how I'm off but I'm on 
 Lame niggas try to make a move like pawn 
 I'm the one and only Bambino fawn 
 Give me that track, man, leave it to professionals 
 I am just a rapper, man, talk like a vegetable 
 Don't be surprised, my face don't change 
 A nigga make waves like a baseball game 
 I'm a do me so hard I'll get pregnant 
 Will I have another me? Nigga, trick question 
 There's only one of me like the G in this sentence 
 G for Gambino, wear a crown like dentures 
 Thanks to the fans, love ya like family 
 No I don't remember when my mouth lost it's sanity 
 Nerdy girls, hipster, Frye boots, hoodie 
 Make me wanna fuck the whole word in a good way 
 And if I can't say he is so handsome 
 Get like me, that's the sick boy anthem 
 I am just a rapper, so I'm not speakin' 
 And I won't stop like a vampire's weekend 
 Sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick... 
 (Is hip-hop hereditary? I don't know 
 Oh, the boys move fast, you should take it slow 
 Well, we all need someone to tell us when to go 
 A beat-box imaginary in the show 
 All your shell-toes lined up in a row 
 All your favorite breaks, your favorite ELO)
