(Verse 1: Childish Gambino) 
 People say I'm crazy, I'm loony, I'm psycho 
 I like it 
 I got my shit checked like Nike 
 Doctor said he'd never seen anything like me 
 Chances of recovery are nil to not likely 
 Boy so crazy make your baby mama look sane 
 Kicking thoughts around like he got a loose brain 
 I got a whiskey, sour, sober 
 Until I fall down like it's mid October 
 Young young Hova 
 Boy I say, for goodness sake 
 I'm in my prime like I'm standing on my dinner plate 
 You niggas innerspace cause you come up Martin Short 
 I'm so fly I don't need a right wing from Drudge ReportExplain 
 (Hook x2: Childish Gambino) 
 Ah! Stay wildin' like me! 
 My name Bam-B! 
 (Verse 2: G.E.T.H.) 
 People say I'm angry 
 But if you're happy, you're crazy 
 I'm violent, so I've got a blue belt from Renzo Gracie 
 Read the news today, oh boy, some kids are dead 
 Pulled the covers over my head and went straight back to bed 
 Cause even my good days are generally bad 
 At my happiest, I'm just slightly less sad 
 And I get mad if you're glad to be alive 
 'Cause I had a chance at a happy life 
 Good mom, good dad 
 Seriously trust me, you wouldn't wanna be me 
 The best days of my life involve leftovers and TV 
 I got almost no friends and I don't know how to handle this 
 Even the friends I do got are all moving to Los Angeles 
 Even I'm tired of my whining 
 Even I don't want no more of me 
 I whine more than a 3-year old multiplied by Morrisey 
 Every time I meet someone who wants to be my friend 
 The first thought that I have is, "Yo what the fuck is wrong with them?" 
 I go through life with my fists up 
 But trust me my fists are all 
 Full of handfuls of Wellbutrin and Risperdal 
 I'm depressed y'all 
 Someone please help me (Please help me) 
 Seriously (Seriously right now) 
 Help 
 (Verse 3: Childish Gambino) 
 I'm good with the N 
 No not the Nina 
 Mean I'm good with the hammer so I'll fix your broke heater 
 And not your bro Keeter 
 I don't tote guns 
 I never had white so I never needed one 
 And the hood respect me, I rose from the ashes 
 They call me the phoenix in the clear rim glasses 
 They saw me work with all that work 
 Now I got my own enterprise, call me Kirk 
 And I'm born on an air force base, so I'm fly 
 Move out to Decatur, that's Atlanta's Bed-Stuy 
 I got that pink like pussy 
 Got that pussy day and night so they call me Kid Cudi 
 Bitch!
