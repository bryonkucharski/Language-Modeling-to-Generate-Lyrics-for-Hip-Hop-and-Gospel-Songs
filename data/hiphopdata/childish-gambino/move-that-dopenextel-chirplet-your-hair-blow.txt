 Body that the superstar lookin' for 
 Hey baby, let's just go for a ride, okay

 Even in the winter flexin' with the top down 
 (Verse 3: Childish Gambino) 
 Top down, let 'em see a king 
 East side, East side, I'm just bein' me

 All we know is trust, that's the R O Y A L T Y 
 Please don't ask a king what it's hard to be
