I can feel it deep inside my body 
 I've been watching all this all night 
 I got to move it, this pressure brewing 
 This world don't feel alright 
 Everyone, everyone 
 Get down, baby, get down, baby 
 Fly, fly, fly, high 
 Everyone, everyone 
 Get down, baby, get down, baby 
 Fly, fly, fly, son 
 No good's happening 
 World, we're out of captains 
 Everyone just wants a better life 
 They tried to kill us 
 Love to say they feel us 
 But they won't take my pride 
 Everyone, everyone 
 Get down, baby, get down, baby 
 Fly, fly, fly, high 
 Everyone, everyone 
 Get down, baby, get down, baby 
 Fly, fly, fly, son 
 Everyone 
 Get down, baby 
 Fly, fly, fly, high 
 Everyone 
 Get down, baby 
 Fly, fly, fly, son
