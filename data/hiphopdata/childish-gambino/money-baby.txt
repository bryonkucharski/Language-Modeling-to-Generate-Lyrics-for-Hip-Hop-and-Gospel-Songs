I like smokin' loud, I like being me 
 I might drop them bars, that AT&T 
 I like makin' moves, I like being King 
 If you like that ballin', I show you what that ballin' be 
 Money baby, money baby, money baby 
 Money baby, money baby, money baby 
 Money baby, money baby, money baby 
 Fly girl, she named Beatle 
 Clothes off, she don't need 'em 
 Animals, she don't eat 'em 
 Hungry for it, I feed her, uh, I feed her 
 You already know that I feed her 
 I don't mess with them fuck boys, she said I don't either 
 She said I'm gone eat her, attitude so diva 
 Got a big place like Scarface, treat her ass like Elvira 
 Skin tone godiva, smokin' on that cheeba 
 Girl you got me so hypnotized that thang be givin' me fever 
 Let me get it 
 Take her to Kauai, threw up on the beach 
 Fucked on the floor, we ain't gotta speak 
 Beach, getting high like a motherfuck 
 Royalty the team so you know what's up 
 Kitty so good, let me beat it up, kitty so good I could sleep in it 
 Hollow tip flow sending shots to my enemies 
 Niggas who tried to Nick Cannon me 
 Thoughts were so bad that I pleaded insanity 
 Bottles, I pop me a case 
 Live on the radio bought me a place 
 This is my summer of love 
 Yeah, these bitches is down 
 But never put nothin' above 
 Kick it like Kazuya 
 This game is how we maneuver 
 There's plenty fish in the sea and I treat them groupies like grouper 
 My life inside a computer, back up, my soul to the cloud 
 Funny we show 'em class and they call me the class clown 
 Money is in my jeans, best believe that it's passed down 
 Got the room thumpin, she tell me don't stop 
 I mean really don't stop 
 I must be doing something 
 Something really on point, something really on point 
 Now she look back at it 
 But she give me that look when I gotta dip out 
 Stop being Dramatic 
 Can't nobody do it like this 
 Forgot her name as soon as I hit 
 Got that buzz, the phone was silent 
 Run the game, that's us 
 Fort Knox, gold bars 
 Let us get it on both sides, I did it all, no cosign 
 And I'm ballin' like I give a fuck 
 Now they know it's us 
 Smokin' like she wanna fuck 
 We are not in love, she's a grownup 
 And I'm so childish 
 Still that's my bitch 
 Waste our time with all this
