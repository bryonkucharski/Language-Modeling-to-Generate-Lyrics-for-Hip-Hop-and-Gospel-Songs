Niggas wanna have some, all I wants to have it all 
 They wanted something different, nigga problem solved 
 Drunk off the high life, death is when I'll sleep it off, 
 Lifes a hangover and this rapping shits my tylenol 
 I could call any girl in my phone right now, 
 Have a pillow and a mouth watch her bite down, 
 She like me 'cause I'm flier than a kite now, 
 Its funny how I get these write ups on what I write down 
 Chick on my left arm, she could write The King And I, 
 I'd rather die the truth, these niggas live a lie 
 Dressed like a gentleman, my mouth is never civilized, 
 See me as a hero, use my little brother's eyes. 
 Always do me like I love self portraits, 
 Now these fake niggas say hay like horse shit, 
 People treat me different but I'm still the same person, 
 I don't know what it means, I just know that its worth it, 
 I know I'm not perfect, but I am original 
 Wallet stay healthy, vitamins, minerals, 
 Gotta feed the bitch right, stuff her full of spinach, 
 Facebook messages asking how I did, 
 No time to respond, time is money, lifes a debit card, 
 Spend it on the right shit, these bitches want you overdrawn, 
 Drake with dyslexia, I have gone so far 
 My life is a green light, I always try to go hard. 
 I am just Different 
 I am so different, the games on lid eye (?), 
 Listen to my mixtape, change your all shit up, 
 Salad backstage, I just wanna eat alone, 
 Crowd at my shows more mixed than Rashida Jones, 
 Haters say I'm changing, but I haven't changed at all 
 Indie kids saying that I ruined all their favorite songs, 
 Hood niggas sayin' that I'm whiter than that colgate, 
 Hatin' on my progress, I'm a long ways from Bro Rape, 
 Black Clark Kent, all I needs a louis lane, 
 But let her spend the night once and watch her go insane, 
 Voice mail, E-mail, sending text message, 
 We are not engaged just because I made breakfast, 
 Believe me you don't want this, I am all about business, 
 Life is a bitch, I must be dating her sisters, 
 Got to be different, take chances like pictures, 
 Emerge victorious, stunt on y'all bitches, 
 I'm not at the top, but y'all niggas know I'm comin' fast, 
 Rap will change after me, all of this will come to pass, 
 Rappers start to use real instruments and shit, 
 Niggas start to copy me, dumb it down and make it rich, 
 I am not a novelty, just the first to do it different, 
 I have always been this good, you were just laughing too hard to listen, 
 Got my career overnighted, maybe you should order one, 
 Springsteen this city cause this city we were born to run. 
 I am Just Different
