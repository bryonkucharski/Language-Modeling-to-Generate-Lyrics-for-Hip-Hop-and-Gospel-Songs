Girl show your wobble out 
 I'm not Queen Latifah but I set it off 
 I'm lookin' like a tight rainbow, Cangos 
 Got my blue rules 
 Lookin' like candy so I'm goodie two shoes 
 Call me Sproose Goose cause my clothes so fly 
 I'm not Howard Hughes, but I'm not a sane guy 
 I'm a Big Mac, you just a small fry 
 Tryin' so hard to get that swagger like mine 
 I got them steps on my head I guess my mind wanders 
 Try to emulate my lifestyle like condoms 
 I'm fly on the mic, I'm fly as a DJ 
 I keep a thick chick on the wire like Wee Bey 
 He say she say that I'm so handsome 
 And play keep away from his girl like ransom 
 Sorry that your girls all heroes like Sylar 
 You know I'm from the south, I stay dirty like Tyler 
 So sick wit it that they call me Ebola 
 My boom box handy, blastin' that stink 
 You can Marcus like Camby they call me the Tech 
 Cause nobody can touch me, I'm fire with a fade 
 I ain't a lazy boy but I'm always gettin' laid 
 I'm jack of all trades I can do no wrong 
 I make a huge fart and it sound like a song 
 I talk jibber jabber and it comes out words 
 I shit out diamonds, you flossin my turds 
 I don't like ice... a little bit of gold and I'm nice 
 The Cool Kids understand my plight 
 I'm a simple Sam, I'm only sick wit it cause that's who I am 
 I keep that shit slick like my name was Pam 
 And even if I didn't 
 I'd be the flyest nigga drivin' around in a Civic 
 And for those who didn't get it you should play it back 
 I'm sick like a dog on crack, for realer
