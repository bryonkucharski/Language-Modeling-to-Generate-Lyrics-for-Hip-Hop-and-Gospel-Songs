Now when they see us on the streets 
 All they wanna do is take pics 
 And I'm like, okay (yeah, okay) 
 And when they hear us on the beat 
 All they wanna do is make hits 
 And I'm like, okay (yeah, okay) 
 And if you're feelin' like I'm feelin' 
 How the world should be: perfectly 
 Fire like I'm third degree, and suddenly 
 Shawty, we got so high 
 Fire Fly 
 Skateboardin' down at Washington Square 
 Lookin' for quarters 
 Maybe afford a falafel for dinner, ugh 
 I'm so broke man 
 Scholarship apology 
 Facebook messages from college kids who hollerin' 
 Girls like, "we love you, we go to LSU 
 You gotta do a show so we can come and molest you" 
 This rap stuff is magic 
 I used to get called "Oreo" and "Faggot" 
 I used to get more laughs when I got laughed at 
 Oh you got a mixtape? That's fantastic 
 But everybody thought it was jokes though 
 They half right, the joke is 
 I got flow so don't act like 
 You ain't sittin' there with your friends like, it can't be 
 I know Donald Glover, he weak man, he can't be 
 I'm still knocked down, but I up the ante 
 Me and hip-hop, that black Sid and Nancy 
 It's hard to make HOV the footsteps you followin' 
 Especially when your niggas look like Carlton 
 The pretty girls usin' skin so soft 
 Only be likin' black dudes with their hats broke off 
 Man you act too soft 
 Fuck you! I'm from the projects 
 My mom was just workin' to give me options 
 No live shows, 'cause I can't find sponsors 
 For the only black kid at a Sufjan concert 
 Yeah so, whatcha gonna do man? 
 You won't speak to the hood, man 
 If I was given one chance I think I could, man 
 These black kids want somethin' new, I swear it 
 Somethin' they wanna say but couldn't 'cause they embarrassed 
 All I do is make the stuff I wanna write 
 Reference things I wanna watch, reference girls I wanna bite 
 Now I'm firefly like a burning kite 
 And yousa fake fuck like a fleshlight 
 Even dudes who like me straight lookin' at me crazy 
 Like, how the hell he drop a EP and meet Jay-Z? 
 Girls used to tell me I ain't cool enough 
 Now text me pics sayin', "You could tear this up" 
 I don't really like shades, big rims, or jewelry 
 But gettin' time of day from a model is new to me 
 Bein' me isn't as hard as it used to be 
 Now everyone sing the chorus man, you do it so beautifully
