(D.C. Pierson) 
 Y'all know the name 
 No action, all flame 
 It's D to the C, no practice, all game 
 And not the game that your computer came installed with 
 So ditch the lame Twit you are currently involved with 
 The Derrick Boys a bunch of crazy brothers like the Baldwins 
 Echo motherfucker, you are just another dolphin 
 Hello motherfucker, like I walked in on incest 
 Do it motherfucker, talking does not impress 
 Us, man, us 
 It's all about us 
 Like them self absorbed teen girls talking on the bus 
 We trust you to pay when we ask you to pay 
 Till then, Chili Peppers, we give it away 
 I don't fuck the fans, I am not the industry 
 Man, I hate it when the man comes between you and me 
 I don't masturbate, I give a handjob to a star and 
 Picture you bumping out this anthem in your car 
 Still showing up for our dorks, geeks, losers 
 Rode out from New York on six beach cruisers 
 And if we could we'd ride with every kid right on the handlebars 
 We are just some rappers like some fat kid ate the candy bars 
 (Childish Gambino) 
 Yes I'm back with a whole new attitude 
 Flier than a Cardinal, check my fuckin' latitude 
 Yes I'm so sick man, somebody call the doctor 
 Girls stay wet like I'm fucking with a lobster 
 I stopped talking I'm tired of paying 'em lip service 
 Switched over from street niggas to hipsters 
 I am so different, Donald Glover in the bitch 
 I don't need to use my rapper name, that's just Childish 
 And they used to call me Oreo, dunk me in that milk 
 Maybe then I will be white enough to hang out with them kids 
 They have to call you names when they don't know what you are 
 Now they know just what I are, baby girl I am a star 
 APC kicks, looking like a British boy 
 More money means more problems, I have been annoyed 
 Dude mad 'bout the girl that I came with 
 I'm fly, she fly, you are just penguin 
 I am just a rapper so I don't speak English 
 I just go hard like the traffic light changes 
 Sick boy, bitch, we the clique like seat belts 
 Yes I'm on fire I don't have to ask how heat felt 
 When I was 14, man nobody else was thinking this 
 A nigga off the chain, man I Abraham Lincoln'd this 
 I am just different 
 Motherfucker, I'm different 
 Yeah, I am just different 
 Yeah, I am just different
