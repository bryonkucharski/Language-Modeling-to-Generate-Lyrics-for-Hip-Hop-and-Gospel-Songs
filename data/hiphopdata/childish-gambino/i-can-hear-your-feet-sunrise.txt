Sick. Uh. 
 Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. 
 Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. 
 I do not talk. 
 I do not talk. I am just a rapper. 
 Childish Gambino, hot as a flaming cheeto 
 I'm tighter than baby speedos 
 I'm shifting another kilo 
 And that's because my shits dope 
 Walking past the red rope 
 The bouncer is my kin folk 
 So I don't need credentials 
 Sick boy is my clique 
 I got that shit inside a headlock 
 Love to make that bam bam 
 We were born to make the bed rock 
 I am so hip hop 
 More so than you guys 
 I am legend 
 You guys are true lies 
 Tipsy like some jenga 
 Shout out to my topangas 
 Them fifty fit girls stay wrapped around my finga 
 Nerdy girls from every where 
 They scope me out like there he is 
 My whole crew's sick 
 I'm hanging out with jerry's kids 
 Hold up mother fucker 
 It's gambini on the microphone 
 Screaming like your father when he comes home and the light are on 
 Girls addicted to my dick 
 My wallet is there methadone 
 Brain dead niggas love beef 
 They are vegetables 
 I am on that fly shit 
 Fuck that, I'm orbiting 
 My face is everywhere 
 Fuck that, I'm norbiting 
 I can feel your heat, momma 
 I can hear your feet, momma 
 ...Give you the sunrise 
 I wanna give you the sunrise 
 I wanna give you the sunrise 
 I wanna give you the sunrise
