I'm so drunk tonight and I 
 I don't got nowhere to go 
 I'm so drunk tonight and I 
 I don't got nowhere to go 
 Childish Gambino 
 I'm trying to hold my liquor 
 A vomit stain on my t-shirt 
 A sick boy but getting sicker 
 I don't really wanna take another marijuana 
 But I do it 'cause I'm stupid and it hits me I'm a goner
