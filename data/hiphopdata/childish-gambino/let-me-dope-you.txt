Welcome to the culdesac, this is where the street ends 
 I am just a rapper, I ain't got the time for speakin' 
 Nigga stay weak like tornado and a tree branch 
 I never have a weak day, my life's a long weekend 
 Fuckin' with ya raw, bitch. My mouth should get tested 
 Sleepin' on a nigga, hope you feel well rested 
 Gambino stay hard, can't nobody pull the cord out 
 A nigga fucked up, like a hang gliding whore house 
 Sick boy. Yeah, the clique on deck. 
 Yes, I rap absurd. Got the game upset 
 And they rap about the jewelry, the weed they smoke 
 And I rap about my life, and niggas think it's a joke, nah 
 I only put real on a nigga 
 Bitches see the money, try and steal on a nigga 
 Yes, I'm on fire, you can feel it on a nigga 
 Step away from the heat, they Shaquille-in' on a nigga 
 Treat niggas like pussy, go hard on 'em 
 Watch the swagga get swiped like a card, bought 'em 
 The swag's unique, I don't even worry 'bout 'em 
 I got the tortoise shell frames and the argyle 
 You wouldn't think from the things I'm fashionin' 
 I'd get more bush than Kim Kardashian 
 Drop hot shit. Yeah, my mouth's a laxative 
 Born to be the greatest, this is not by accident 
 Hey playa, what's good? 
 Let me dope you 
 Hey hata, what's hood? 
 Let me dope you 
 I'm on fire like wood 
 Let me dope you 
 And you don't wanna fuck with dood 
 Let me dope you 
 Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit 
 Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit 
 Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit 
 Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit 
 I'm a genius, I ain't gotta fake shit 
 My cup runeth over, you can take sips 
 I'm in a spa, white robe like a racist 
 Niggas can't see me, I will pay for your Lasik 
 Fuck what ya heard, bitch. I'm flyer than you ever seen 
 My wallet make paper, call it Evergreen 
 Ashy to classy, finally got some Vaseline 
 Live inside a sauna 'cause I always got my self-esteem 
 Name in your mouth, and it seems as though I struck a nerve 
 I never fit in like my penis in these tiny girls 
 I figured I was different from these other guys 
 When I wrote for 30 Rock, I was under 25 
 These other rappers wanna fade into the background 
 Ima stand out when these niggas done sat down 
 I always pack heat. Yeah, my mouth need a pat down 
 Money, girls, clothes. I don't worry about that now 
 Hey playa, what's good? 
 Let me dope you 
 Hey hata, what's hood? 
 Let me dope you 
 I'm on fire like wood 
 Let me dope you 
 And you don't wanna fuck with dood 
 Let me dope you 
 Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit 
 Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit 
 Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit 
 Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit
