 Yeah, yes I'm on top 
 I'm going this hard, and no I won't stop 
 Wassup 
 Let me hear you holla bitch: actor, writer, rapper 
 Nigga I do all of it 
 Lactose tolerant, addicted to cheddar 
 And I spent it on a jacket man I don't know no better 
 Yeah it's Childish Gambino, yeah I'm fly as a feather 
 Yeah my nigga be suburban but my flow keep it ghetto 
 Keep my swagger poloroid you can watch it develop 
 Ain't it funny in a year I went from different to special 
 Yeah I got it together, yeah I took those chances 
 Labels on me like I might cause cancer 
 Yes a nigga flow went from Camry to Phantom 
 I'm just talking real shit, hope you can handle 
 Sleepin' on the jet like Lear like chandel 
 Flyer than a jet women hoping they can land 'I'm 
 How we turn everything to gold that they handle? 
 I am just different, that's the only answer 
 Yeah, yes I'm on top 
 I'm going this hard, and no I won't stop 
 Yeah, yes I'm on top 
 I'm going this hard, and no I won't stop 
 I'm a hero (8x), yeah 
 Back on my grind, nigga I'm a skater 
 She just think I'm fine, nigga you's a hater 
 Sign with no name, they just want to label me 
 They should call it what these other niggas are afraid to be 
 APC store walkin' out with eight bags 
 Yeah I'm killin' paper, call it poppin' tags 
 You ever spend three grand on designer vision, 
 When you should've spent it on your little sis' tuition? 
 She played my album when nobody else out there would listen 
 I'm comin' harder than these girls that you would swear were pissin' 
 Davinci-esque, I'm the real deal 
 The only thing I don't know is how afraid feel 
 I'm living everything these other niggas lyin' bout 
 Bitches don't believe me, to prove it to 'em I fly 'em out 
 She say that I'm her everything, I'm better than those other guys 
 I say I'm just a rapper, she tell me that's a fuckin' lie 
 Yeah, yes I'm on top 
 I'm going this hard, and no I won't stop 
 Yeah, yes I'm on top 
 I'm going this hard, and no I won't stop 
 I'm a hero (8x), yeah 
 They said me rappin' was like MJ and baseball 
 But that would make me MJ, so motherfuck all of y'all 
 Trippin' on this fame shit, drinking like a fuckin' fish 
 Listen to the next track I be on That other shit 
 Yes I sound weird, nigga, take it as a compliment 
 Guess who's in the house and representing like a congressman 
 Anything I put my mind to I accomplish it 
 From writing scripts with Tina Fey to laying down the hardest shit 
 Who else is doing what I'm doing? No one 
 And I mean girls too, intended no pun 
 I'm on the road son, busy like I'm Bone Thug 
 Comment left anonymous cause ain't nobody want none 
 She laying in my bed she gotta be bi-curious 
 Barf on the track, the amazing and rap-furious 
 Damn bloggers argue whether or not I'm serious 
 It's Nas' Illmatic not Eddie Murphy's Delirious 
 Got the limelight, you stupid you think I'm sharing this 
 Showing up late, promoters wondering where he is 
 Got some nightmares, my family gotta be scariest (?) 
 But I would never fail, I'm a hero one of the best there is 
 Yeah, yes I'm on top 
 I'm going this hard, and no I won't stop 
 Yeah, yes I'm on top 
 I'm going this hard, and no I won't stop 
 I'm a hero (8x), yeah
