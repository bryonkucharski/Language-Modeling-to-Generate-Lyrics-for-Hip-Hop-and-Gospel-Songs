(Intro: Nipsey Hussle) 
 Turn that beat up for me 
 Really everything, like the headphones 
 Yeah, yeah, a little bit louder 
 No punch, you know that mean that we workin' hard 
 (Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle) 
 Look, young rich nigga shit, pops was an immigrant 
 Lifestyle illegit, but know I own businesses 
 Started out the trunk, ended up at the dealership 
 All gold Rollie, black face no blemishes 
 Legend in my city 'cause I grind so vigorous 
 If I show my face west of Texas, that's a big event 
 Gotta pay me twenty cents just to hear me vent 
 I'm really out here on some shit, you should take a flick 
 Ballin' on my own ten toes, so the difference is 
 I call shots never ask for permission, man 
 I got a lot of big plans in my vision and 
 I ain't failed yet, 'bout a dollar hell yes 
 I'm a problem filled test, it's only getting worse 
 I swear I'm getting money, I just hope you gettin' yours 
 I'm killin' niggas solo so you know I'm gettin' more 
 Now that young Gambino on the chorus, go 
 (Hook: Childish Gambino) 
 This is for that real shit, this is for that East side 
 This is for my bad girls, this is for them good guys 
 This is for my grandma, this is for that West side 
 This is for them niggas talkin' shit on a website 
 Damn I feel good, you ain't feelin' nothin' 
 This is for my niggas who be livin' dime a dozen 
 Bino got that good shit, Nipsey got them aces 
 On some young rich shit, Kennedys with black faces 
 (Break: Childish Gambino) 
 Yeah, black faces 
 My Rollie so racist, all black faces 
 Obama on that million dollar bill, black faces 
 Yeah, nigga, black faces 
 Look, yo I got this 
 Yo, turn, turn it up a little 
 Ay, here we go, okay 
 (Verse 2: Childish Gambino) 
 League of my own, swag Geena Davis 
 Only rapper make 100k on your playlist 
 Niggas talk on twitter, but in life they don't say shit 
 My Rollie so racist, all black faces 
 We the new facet, kill 'em like Jason 
 Grind in my sleep man a nigga need braces 
 Wonder what you feelin' like, used to be the nervous type 
 They ain't mention Bino? Man that shit must be on purpose, right? 
 Hostile, nigga my style 
 Kind of flow to paint a picture, Norman Rockwell 
 I don't eat pasta, everything is low-carb 
 I don't fly coach now, say I fly Goyard 
 Leave a face covered in that coast guard 
 Metaphor Mozart, all we do is tell 'em the truth 
 M Fox to my people on some family ties 
 Magazines got black faces when somebody dies 
 I mean look at Donna Summers, she was tryin' to survive 
 People wrestle over petty cash 
 When we should be really cryin' over that one percent 
 Like we tipped a milk glass 
 Fuck y'all, I'mma let my grandkids ball 
 Look to the future, these dudes so last week 
 See me stuntin' so Conde Nasty 
 Me and Nipsey on some grown shit, no rent 
 Own shit, so Jim Crow shit, black faces 
 (Outro: Childish Gambino) 
 Ay, nigga, black faces 
 Black faces 
 That's royalty, nigga
