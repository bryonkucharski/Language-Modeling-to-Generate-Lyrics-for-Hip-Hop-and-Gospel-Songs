It seems like they all want me to fail 
 But I'm not goin' back, not goin' back, baby 
 Please tell me you don't want me to fail 
 'Cause I'm not goin' back, not goin' back 
 I could've been a tragedy 
 That's why these fake niggas who call me pussy are mad at me 
 'Cause they ain't have the smarts or the heart 
 Ain't you read the fuckin' book, 'Things Fall Apart'? 
 I was never gonna stay the same 
 All I ever really wanted was to change the game 
 Spent the year kickin' ass and takin' names 
 Try to tell it to your heart, Taylor Dayne 
 Mama told me I was special when them test scores came in 
 Callin' me the new Will Smith, that's Jaden 
 Callin' me a faggot when I'm rappin', that's hatin' 
 I need to slow down, what the fuck is y'all sayin'? 
 Step inside the party, y'all niggas is mood killers 
 My lifestyle simple, live easy and Bruce Willis 
 I'm the boss, Michael Scott, y'all bitches is just Phyllis 
 Set the world on fire, y'all motherfuckers is chillin', what is this? 
 That's why these fuckin' MCs want their asses back 
 Don't you know that I'm a rapist, ask a track 
 Whiskey sippin', wanna drink the whole bottle 
 But these smart middle-class black kids need a role model 
 Fuckin' hate me, that's what I'm used to 
 Suck a dick, we the shit, Metamucil 
 Goddamn, man, there's gotta be a better way 
 Than pill poppin' all these drugs so I can stay awake 
 Like I'm Jessie in this bitch, I'm so excited 
 There's a party at the top, you ain't invited 
 But it's lame and all the bitches is fake 
 You think about your old girl and how breakin' up's a mistake 
 Black dudes assume I'm closeted or kinda gay 
 White people confused like girl on Glee and Gabourey 
 IAmDonald is a full-time job 
 These niggas want me to fail so they can write me off 
 It seems like they all want me to fail 
 But I'm not goin' back, not goin' back, baby 
 Please tell me you don't want me to fail 
 'Cause I'm not goin' back, not goin' back 
 Dirty girls love my dick, they're cockroaches 
 Jewish girls eat my meat, it's not kosher 
 Relax, black chick, I think that I have offended thee 
 Got nothin' against the sistas, I just don't think they're into me 
 I am not a thug, aka what they pretend to be 
 I am just myself, aka my worst enemy 
 Yeah, bitch, cut the swag with a fuckin' knife 
 I come hard like my life keep her pussy tight 
 It's cool though, it's all good 
 You want a dude who keep it real and stay hood 
 I'm sorry, babe but I act me 
 I don't act black, whatever that be 
 I'm just happy these girls seem into me now 
 Yeah, they lookin' for some In-N-Out, animal style 
 With this lettuce, cheese, bread, makin' sandwiches 
 That's why you niggas fail like all of your parents' marriages 
 Ran into Rashida Jones, told me that she heard my song 
 When I called her mixed like the crowd at my last show 
 She said to write her somethin' nice on the next track 
 But she cute so I wrote her ass a whole rap 
 Man, I threw that shit away, it felt dumb 
 Believe me it was bad, we're better off, you're welcome 
 I worked hard on that song like day and night 
 That whole song made this one verse crazy, right? 
 I guess it all goes somewhere, you know that 
 Like that bullshit you talked before Culdesac 
 I didn't know he had it in I'm 
 Couldn't see me as Spider-Man but now I'm spittin' venom 
 Now you payin' attention, pick your fuckin' face up 
 When I wanna be a superhero I just wake up 
 Renaissance man with a Hollywood buzz 
 I refuse to go back to not likin' who I was because 
 Fake love, these fake dreams, these fake sounds 
 All the things that we felt, your voice was screaming too loud 
 I know what you're ready to be but it isn't with me 
 So I'm ready to leave you alone 
 I don't really wanna fight like this, I don't ever wanna lose your kiss 
 All I ever wanted was someone to hold on to 
 I just wanna be your girl, everything you haven't heard 
 Plus, I just wanna be with you 
 (With you) 
 With you 
 (With you) 
 With you 
 (With you) 
 I just wanna be with you 
 (With you) 
 With you 
 (With you) 
 With you
