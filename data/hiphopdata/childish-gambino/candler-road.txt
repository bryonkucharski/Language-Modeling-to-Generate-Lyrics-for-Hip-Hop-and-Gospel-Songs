I ain't lovin' these fake hoes, room smellin' like 8 Swishers 
 Room service like 2K, NBA, I'm ballin', nigga 
 All them niggas, fallin' like Autumn, nigga 
 Talkin' shit, I saw them niggas, now their daughter want a picture 
 Rough ain't it? Fuck famous 
 Niggas too real, got the most haters 
 Wrote a story so Stephen Curry, how it feel to be golden? 
 Why was I chosen? 
 Hanalei Bay with my bae, what can I say? 
 I did it, my timin' was perfect, I'm comin', they know it 
 Becomin' the last great American poet 
 The flow Lindsay Lohan 
 Tired, nigga, retired, nigga 
 My word is art like a hieroglyphic 
 What island is this? 
 Cabernet, I can smell a tarp 
 You wanna swim but can barely walk 
 She 'fraid of sharks, she'd hate my lawyer 
 Atlanta, Georgia, got somethin' for yah 
 I'm doin' somethin', stay with it 
 I sport the Oakland A fitted 
 Cause this money ballin', I'm throwin' funny 
 But all the kids'll go get it, God dammit I'm ill 
 I got one question for the haters, is your girl on the pill? 
 I'm playin' though, but like really, really? 
 Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man 
 I got a hook for this, it's like 
 Harmonizing 
 I love you all the time 
 Somethin' like that 
 I'm the man forever 
 They can't let a nigga live cause the life is better 
 85 everyday, why'd I bring this sweater? 
 I fell asleep on the beach, tiny pink umbrella 
 Fell out of my drink, she yellin', "What we doin' tonight?" 
 50k their first week, you ain't doin' it right 
 Young Bino best friends with the show promoters 
 Good year, my career is floatin', it's all me 
 'Cause I stay real, the words pay, niggas don't feel 
 'Cause they ain't feel a nigga, tried to kill a nigga 
 But he still went stupid 
 Silver stones honorin' the game so clueless 
 These niggas ain't us 
 Hopin' that I diss you back so I can make you famous
