As time goes on (Hello?, hello?) 
 Your talk keeps getting smaller (Hello?, hello?) 
 As Childish lives in his short shorts, 
 He got no time for your short money 
 Two gold chains and I still don't never wear 'em 
 Why would I wear 'em? Cheese like a camera 
 Spendin' money son a bitch nigga like Sanford 
 I'm lookin' in the mirror, I'm like 'Damn, I'm so handsome' 
 If it ain't 'bout that money, why a young god answer? 
 Ghost on my wrist (wrist), got me so Casper 
 Flow so cold, watch them haters get asthma 
 And every time we fuckin', man she think that's the last one 
 Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk 
 Three cellphones and I still don't ever call 'em 
 Why would I call 'em? Bitch you know I'm ballin' 
 Spendin' money, make it bounce back like Spalding (Swish) 
 Got a new nigga and he say he from New Orleans 
 And he ain't talkin' money nigga, why the fuck you talkin' 
 All my bitches bossy, all my diamonds flossy 
 Rap game sriracha man you know I'm saucy 
 I got a white dude in Boston, he whip an Audi 
 Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk 
 Young Bino, we be mobbin' 
 You don't see me, I'm on an island 
 These haters left us no choice 
 Leave the trap like so moist 
 Little rock like dope boys 
 Oh my God, I'm out of fucks 
 Colombian but she ain't a plug 
 That's racist 
 In '96 I had K-swiss 
 You 96 with some fake bitch 
 And I 69'd with a bunch of dimes and that money talk my language 
 Head game so Cambridge 
 God damn, you dirty bitch 
 You were lettin' me bust in it 
 But if they ask I plead the fifth 
 Ok this the part where I need y'all to make it bounce like Spalding 
 Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding 
 Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding 
 Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding 
 Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding 
 Got a new nigga and he say he from New Orleans
