I ain't gonna be around for ever, so fuck it all, 
 Seein all this pussy, Ima fuck it all 
 Fly around the world, eatin good, drinkin' alcohol, 
 You ain't nothing like me, nigga, not at all. 
 I ain't gonna be around for ever, so fuck it all, 
 Seein all this pussy, Ima fuck it all 
 Fly around the world, eatin good, drinkin' alcohol, 
 You ain't nothing like me, nigga, not at all. 
 Tell 'em what it is, I'm takin' great strides, 
 Hood niggas, hipsters, I ain't trying to take sides, 
 Ex-Girlfriend on my mind, she really fucked up, 
 Doing shots of whiskey till my friends are saying that's enough, 
 I really really miss her, sometimes I wanna fuck it all, 
 Mix some warm Guinness with 20 tablets of tylenol, 
 Call 'em while I'm drifting off, tell her that I love her so, 
 Parents crying harder 'cause I didn't even leave a note, 
 Saying that I'm selfish and I'm sorry that I left, 
 But it hurts so much to wake up and I left you guys a check, 
 'Cause I ain't fucking happy, you don't know shit about me, 
 I think it started when she said she happier without me, 
 I really can't blame her 'cause I'm happier without me, 
 I don't see what girls are seeing when they say their all about me, 
 I'm scared they wanna trap me, these all hoes are all liars, 
 I double bag my shit and never cum while I'm inside her, 
 I used to be a sweet dude, now I'm so angry, 
 Look at what these girls and these fake niggas made me, 
 Cry when I'm writing, I don't really know why, 
 I think its 'cause I can't really see myself an old guy, 
 And that scares me, I wanna be around a while, 
 But I feel my purpose goes beyond having raised a child, 
 Bright lights, they tend to burn out fast, 
 So I shine bright, But I'm scared that it won't last. 
 I ain't gonna be around for ever, so fuck it all, 
 Seein all this pussy, Ima fuck it all 
 Fly around the world, eatin good, drinkin' alcohol, 
 You ain't nothing like me, nigga, not at all. 
 I ain't gonna be around for ever, so fuck it all, 
 Seein all this pussy, Ima fuck it all 
 Fly around the world, eatin good, drinkin' alcohol, 
 You ain't nothing like me, nigga, not at all. 
 I'm just about the pot (?), the industry just noticed it, 
 People watching me, I feel like amber rose's tits, 
 Friends of mine are over it, people say I changed, 
 And I tell them that I'm glad, 'cause I don't wanna stay the same, 
 'Cause I used to be poor, I used to be unconfident, 
 I used to hate these haters, now its just the opposite, 
 Not only have I changed, I'm becoming something better, 
 And revenge is for the weak, so I have settled my vendettas, 
 With all of the kids who made my early life a living hell, 
 And I hope you're doing well and feeling better 'bout yourself, 
 Don't know if you can tell, but change is usually for the better, 
 I used to like these bitches but couldn't afford to get em, 
 But now I'll take your girl, yeah player pay homage, 
 That's why I fuck these bad mamas, Kate Gosselin, 
 I'm trying to tell the world I'm nothing to be trifled with, 
 Donald Glover staying hotter than some rifle spit, 
 They only wanna fuck with you after you made your way, 
 But when you started out you couldn't pay 'em to stay, 
 But now I got 'em lined up in the lobby door, 
 It makes me wonder what this rapping shits a hobby for, 
 Oh that's right, because I'm gifted in another field, and another field, and another field, 
 They say my public persona don't have enough appeal, 
 I take a lesson from Kanye and give 'em something real, 
 I'm getting all this attention I wanna do it right, 
 That's why I'm performing for you like every single night, 
 To all my fans who's saying Donald Glover about to blow, 
 Just give me six months so you can say I told you so. 
 I ain't gonna be around for ever, so fuck it all, 
 Seein all this pussy, Ima fuck it all 
 Fly around the world, eatin good, drinkin' alcohol, 
 You ain't nothing like me, nigga, not at all. 
 I ain't gonna be around for ever, so fuck it all, 
 Seein all this pussy, Ima fuck it all 
 Fly around the world, eatin good, drinkin' alcohol, 
 You ain't nothing like me, nigga, not at all.
