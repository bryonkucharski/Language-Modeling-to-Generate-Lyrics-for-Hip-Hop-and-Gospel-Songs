(Bizarre) 
 Aye, aye the idiotic kid's back 
 Ready to attack, ready to put two macks to your back 
 Ain't no fussin when I start bustin' 
 Lyrically cussin, why Jay Dee's want production 
 Go to 212 to see my friends 
 Too many Heineken's, the whole crews fightin to get in 
 I'm lookin' around to see who want it 
 I wanna get blunted but only got a dollar on it 
 The rude boys is frontin, legends is pumpin 
 Bella is jumpin', the heat is like shh... bumpin 
 Ready or not rap world here I come 
 Comin' to every battle screamin out, "Who want some" 
 Lyrical warfare for MC's who step 
 Caution watch your step or I'll destroy your rep 
 Lookin' for the crews that cause a threat 
 We ain't ballers yet, we ain't passin no moet 
 I'm playin' in between the sheets in my jeep 
 Lookin' for the freak with the big butt cheeks 
 No disrespect throw your hands up 
 Yeah, grab your girl tell her, put her hands up 
 Throw your hands in the air 
 Put your blunts in the sky 
 Grab a cutiepie 
 And do the butterfly 
 (Bizarre) 
 Cruisin down the Ave, just to hit a spot 
 I got a fat girl on my jock 
 I'm a tell you why I'm the king and you're a pion 
 See what's happenin' your whole style is a rewind 
 Whack MCs will get verbally shot 
 Cause ain't no style like the style I got 
 I'm the idiotic kid that they call Bizarre 
 Get kick out at topless bars because I went too far 
 Don't try to roll if you're a beginner roll a rookie 
 Forget the blunts kid we high off weed-cookies 
 Buddha sets represent the mid-west 
 And I can penetrate trough vest 
 Leaving a whole lot of mess 
 Three millers and a blunt, boy I'm too high 
 Just 'cause I'm a big guy don't mean I can't butterfly 
 My crew's gettin' wasted in Noah's Arc 
 I'm in the back of the club smokin' blunts with Sonya Burnheart 
 Don't matter if your big short or tall 
 Kick your game and give your girl a call 
 The nights over kid, I'm still gettin' splifted 
 Keith Murray dropped the half off the set get lifted
