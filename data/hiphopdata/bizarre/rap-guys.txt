This guy is crazy 
 This guy is a weirdo 
 Outsidaz, what you wanna do 
 This is the gang I'm in 
 Outsidaz, comin' to you 
 (Bizarre) 
 Lord have mercy for any rapper that showed up 
 First it was Oklahoma now it's your house I'm blowin' up 
 'Cause I'm quick to butt fuck yo moms 
 And fuck a nine Bizarre's shootin nuclear bombs 
 Think about it before you diss me on a track 
 I hang with niggas that just got out and ready to go back 
 Bizarre making wack crews fold 
 Me and Bill Clinton wanna bust in those on homeless 14 years old (she's young) 
 Doin' drive by's in fuckin' pink caddies 
 Tie you up and beat you worse the LL Cool J's daddy 
 This is a crime that even MC Gruff couldn't solve 
 Chew dog and it's not you niggas is what leavin' revolved 
 You done fucked around and gotta get a fix 
 Y'all niggas in trouble 'cause I done fucked around and hit a six (rap guys) 
 Who the fuck is y'all wack niggas ignoring 
 Put me in a room full of murderers they be dead by the mornin 
 Rap guys 
 Listen to me, Listen to me rap guys 
 Diss Bizarre you die 
 (Bizarre) 
 We can do this like men 
 Or talk it we're whit 
 Or do it my way and drive by later on tonight 
 Break in your house hang your sister by her shirt 
 Bury her in the dirt, wait for you moms to get home from work 
 Id a killed so many M.C's I can't count the number 
 Niggas writin me letters say "I know what you did last summer" 
 One rapper tested me and though I was a punk 
 And I ain't seen his body since I threw it out of my trunk 
 Fuck around and throw your ass in the lake 
 And never be found like my high school prom date 
 Bizarre's too ill, shoot vein in my father's vein 
 And watch a nigga die like Sugar Hill 
 I'm sicker than a transvestite gettin' fucked by a paraplegic 
 I say dumb shit when I'm weeded 
 Your girl sucked me, bitch you better duck me 
 Or fuck around end up roommates with Mike Hutley 
 Rap guys 
 Listen to me, Listen to me, rap guys 
 Diss Bizarre you die 
 (Bizarre) 
 I be watchin shows from here to Chi town 
 Tell your boys this his last day I'm shuttin this block down 
 I'm the type a guy come to your stage show and boo you 
 Tell you you can use my sample and two weeks later I'll sue you 
 Diss me on your stage show 
 Diss my while you high 
 But ain't no guarantee you'll make it out this bitch fuckin' alive 
 I got weed and drinks and some fuckin' slut 
 Fuck her in the butt, burn her back with hot cigarette butts 
 Quick to throw the fuckin' nine up 
 My crew gets more dirty looks then Queen Latifa in a police line up 
 Don't wind up like your boy name Romer 
 Have your parents wondering when your ass is comin' out this coma 
 Smell the aroma when my crew hits the stage 
 Somebody stop this machine in a rage 
 Fuck your girl disrespect her then I check her 
 Bizarre 98 bitch federation records 
 Rap guys 
 Listen to me, Listen to me rap guys 
 Diss Bizarre you die 
 Fuck that
