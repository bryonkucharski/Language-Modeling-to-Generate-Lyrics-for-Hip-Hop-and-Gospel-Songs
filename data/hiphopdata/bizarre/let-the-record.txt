(Feat. Young Miles) 
 (Chorus: Bizarre) 
 I'm ripped, I'm on the acid trip 
 My DJ's in a coma for lettin' the record skip 
 Lettin' the record skip 
 Lettin' the record skip 
 Lettin' the record skip 
 (Verse 1: Bizarre) 
 Vile, sick, son of a bitch 
 Say shit three times in a row like I don't give a shit (bitch! bitch!) 
 God dammit son of an ass 
 Ladies and gentleman, Bizarre's a dumb ass! 
 Sayin' 'cause words like too short 
 Eatin' pork of all sorts in the middle of New York 
 Beatin' my meat, watchin' sesame street 
 Fuck a sheet, I'll bust in my little niece 
 She's so sweet, a six year old freak 
 Who want me to bust right between her ass cheeks! 
 You ever met a guy with cancer who refused chemo? 
 Call a doctor a homo and do a two week promo! 
 That's me, a fucking G! 
 I'll probably be dead before the end of this CD! 
 MVD, I probably caught it 
 Crack in your neighborhood, I probably brought it! 
 (Chorus: Bizarre) 
 I'm ripped, I'm on the acid trip 
 My DJ's in a coma for lettin' the record skip 
 Lettin' the record skip 
 Lettin' the record skip 
 Lettin' the record skip 
 I'm ripped, I'm on the acid trip 
 My DJ's in a coma for lettin' the record skip 
 Lettin' the record skip 
 Lettin' the record skip 
 Lettin' the record skip 
 (Verse 2: Young Miles) 
 Yeah! when this hennessy get into me, 
 Man I talk shit until I lose my mind like Kennedy! 
 The bottom line, I ain't feelin' your ass! 
 So when the pumps to your car, it ain't to fill it with gas! (gun reloading) (nigga!) 
 Its Young Miles, I'm the boss of the crime! 
 You don't know another nigga that's as hard as I, 
 I clap a nigga in his ride then a toss the nine, 
 I'm at your wake with a bomb, now your coffin flyin'! 
 You tryna say this ain't the bestest record? 
 Man you got it fuck up like sex in heaven! 
 And I can gun you down, I don't fuck around, 
 I have you sleepin' up underground! 
 So when your boy load the lead in the pipe 
 Bitch niggas better run like they scared for they life! 
 And when I pop the thang, 
 Even the niggaz in the crowd catch shots like a hockey game! 
 (Chorus: Bizarre) 
 I'm ripped, I'm on the acid trip 
 My DJ's in a coma for lettin' the record skip 
 Lettin' the record skip 
 Lettin' the record skip 
 Lettin' the record skip 
 I'm ripped, I'm on the acid trip 
 My DJ's in a coma for lettin' the record skip 
 Lettin' the record skip 
 Lettin' the record skip 
 Lettin' the record skip 
 (Verse 3: Bizarre:) 
 I'm a grown ass man, that's an obsessed Usher fan 
 Gonna rub his back and put on his head band (Usher!) 
 Mid-twenties, still workin' at Wendy's (May I help you?) 
 Sniffin' coke with my girlfriend Kemi (laughing) 
 Fuck a cup, I'll piss in your butt! 
 Tell my grandfather shut the fuck up, 
 While I piss in his butt! 
 Can't be around kids, my brains is splattered, 
 I ain't readin' books, I'm fillin' on pampers 
 Bizarre don't give a shit, fucking a bitch eighty-six, 
 (Woman:) he just told you he don't give a shit! 
 My grandmother eighty-six and my grandfather would nut in his butt, 
 I'm a god damn nut!
