(Feat. Da Brigade) 
 All my ladies say WHAT, WHAT, WHAT 
 And all my dogs say WHAT, WHAT, WHAT 
 (Bizarre) 
 Ladies and gentlemen may I grab your attention 
 It's the dopest MC from the Midwest 
 Did I mention 
 So clap your hands and stomp your feet 
 And party on down to the Bizarre Kid beat 
 Throw your hands in the air so I can feel it 
 It's the big guy rappin' with the idiotic literatein 
 Forget your small talk watch Bizarre Kid get wild 
 Guarantee to get your girl warm like a reptile 
 Big chubby guy comin' straight from 7 mile 
 Your girl heard my style 
 And said, "ooh he's foul" 
 So tell your man to stop trippin' bro 
 Or he gonna get rushed by 10 guys he don't even know 
 Representin the men, moneys what I'm gettin' 
 () Still gigglin bush (), my styles forbidden 
 It's the big guy, do the butterfly to the ground 
 And the base head bounce 
 Man I got that packed down 
 Man forget the night 
 We gonna party till the day 
 And I'm a strip dance at your girlfriend's cabaret 
 All my ladies say WHAT, WHAT, WHAT, WHAT 
 And all my dogs say WHAT, WHAT, WHAT, WHAT 
 (Bizarre) 
 Does Bizarre roll with Slim Shady, Yeah yeah 
 Quick to drive up in your Mercedes, Yeah yeah 
 Datin ladies nearly 80, Yeah yeah 
 Now who in this rap game could fade me 
 Some of you rap guys never heard of me 
 Sometimes I be in Dallas or even North New Jersey 
 Forget the Moet we drinkin' Hen dog all night 
 And pass the dance so I can get high as a kite 
 A slow song come on its time to dirty dance 
 And right now I'm grabbin any girl I can 
 Grab her butt cheeks and hold her real tight 
 And tell her me and you were gettin' wild for tonight 
 Gimme your beeper number and check before you leave 
 "Ay yo call me tomorrow and ask for Steve" 
 Oh no this shit I couldn't believe 
 Me and ??? grabbed her by her knees 
 Snatched outta her weave 
 And grabbed the car keys 
 All my ladies say WHAT, WHAT, WHAT, WHAT 
 And all my dogs say WHAT, WHAT, WHAT, WHAT 
 (Kon Artist) 
 Now everybody throw they hands up 
 This ain't a stick 
 We came to this jam 
 To buy ??? and play a game of pick up 
 With any big butt freaks that's done for the cause 
 And yo Bizarre was at the bar down ??? 
 (Kuniva) 
 I'm still game spittin' while you still get in 
 Still gettin' down how we livin' 
 Wild like we outta prison 
 Run our mouth, kick in doors 
 And I'm talkin' to a chicken head that could be yours 
 (Kon Artist) 
 Slam dancin with girls just to see they chest bump 
 Now everybody bu bu bum bump bump 
 And get down to the sounds that we can cock jump 
 Or mess around and get your whole damn block jumped 
 (Kuniva) 
 Watch you beeper when I'm walking through the crowd 
 Which one of y'all actin' wild, getting loud 
 You still screamin that somebody still hatin' on you 
 We in the parkin lot 50 deep waitin on you 
 Da Brigade actin' up and we still scrapin 
 Walkin' back up in the club like ain't nuttin happened 
 What what what 
 All my ladies say WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT 
 And all my dogs say WHAT, WHAT, WHAT 
 All my ladies say WHAT, WHAT, WHAT, WHAT 
 And all my dogs say CUT, CUT, CUT 
 All the DJ's play my CUT, CUT, CUT
