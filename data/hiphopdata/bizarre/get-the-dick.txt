 Them niggas try to rob me could GET THE DICK 
 All them bitches try to play me they GET THE DICK 
 Niggas try to jump B.U. can GET THE DICK 
 We gon' bang when I see you so GET THE DICK 
 Have you ever seen a show with niggas on the mic 
 With one minute rhymes that don't come out right 
 They bite, they never write, that's not polite 
 I got great skills 
 And if my record sells 8 mil 
 I'ma still smoke weed, get dusted, get drunk and take pills 
 Fast gun play gon' get you blast one day 
 Fucking with Zee, it be today mothafucka 
 Newark like a sitcom for no brains 
 ???, Jettin from ? trains 
 Slip a tab and mushrooms in my coffee 
 With half a forty, feel like the walls is moving towards me 
 Till I die from old age 
 I'll be pullin girls up to suck my dick right on the stage 
 So stop talking, get them old jelli's walking 
 'Fore I call Pace celly walkman, and tell him y'all been 
 Acting iffy, and its really starting to piss me 
 And like popcorn, my nigga's be here in a jiffy 
 Will all the Mack 10's step beside me 
 We gon' start wylin and kill everybody 
 (Pace Won) 
 To you fronting ass bitches GET THE DICK 
 To you booty ass labels GET THE DICK 
 To you corny ass rappers GET THE DICK 
 To all you mothafucka's GET THE DICK 
 (Young Zee) 
 Have you ever seen a show with niggas on the mic

 They bite, they never write, that's not polite 
 (Pace Won) 
 Pace Won, Mr. Perfect, I take a warm shower 
 Make a condo, out of saw powder 
 Make the sun eclipse at the born hour 
 I'm a wizard at this shit like Juwon Howard 
 Put my gun up in the ass of crews 
 And start to spray, gotta pay massive dues 
 So I take Emcee's that pass the rules 
 And fly them into space like NASA do 
 I'm a, weed lover, going deep cover 
 Tricking these goofy ass ho's I need rubbers 
 Your favorite nucker, flow butter 
 Niggas get mobbed, leave with they clothes cut up 
 'When you comin' what they askin me 
 'You fresh to no limit like Master P' 
 I be keepin' shit milky like ? cream 
 Pace Won, blaze one, and I'm ? fiends mothafucka 
 (Azz-Iz) 
 To y'all fag ass cops GET THE DICK 
 To you bitches on the block GET THE DICK 
 To you fake weed spots GET THE DICK 
 And y'all niggas without glocks GET THE DICK 
 (Young Zee) 
 Have you ever seen a show with niggas on the mic 
 With one minute rhymes that don't come out right 
 They bite, they never write, that's not polite 
 (Azz-Iz) 
 If your flow is kinda doo-doo 
 I more filthier than white bums from Newark (brick city!) to Honolulu 
 More wine than cherry, raspberry, apple-cranberry, strawberry 
 Muthafuckin flows extraordinary 
 Your bitch ass will get bodied and buried 
 By this slick walking, talking, rhyming dictionary 
 Gimme your mind, let me ? one 
 Fairly handsome, blackened like temper tantrums 
 Spittin' like automatic handguns, 
 You can't run 
 Your style is more garbage than Shirley Manson 
 You got a platinum single, roll me your money 
 I'm bummy but I bet I can get your bitch to beat my dick for me 
 (Bizarre) 
 Doin' drive-bys in less than 2 minutes 
 And I know one of these houses on the block 
 Got your fuckin' family in it 
 And what's the worstist, is y'all niggas gon' need nurses 
 I collect money on your block, like ushers at churches 
 No matter where your boys go, nigga I'ma get 'em 
 You can ask ? Funeral Home, how much business I be sendin 'em 
 You forgot bitch nigga, I know where you stay 
 Loaded AK, get little Johnny out the way 
 Bet you these bats gauruntee your ass won't be walking 
 I rock '98 Suburbans while you push cars from the auction 
 You don't wanna see Bizarre Kid get dumb 
 I beat a bitches ass when I'm in a good mood 
 So imagine if I'm in a bad one 
 You better duck when I pull this nine 
 I done shut up your block so many times 
 All I see is For Sale signs 
 They say these cats only got 9 lives, 
 But Dardin took 8, so tonight you diiiiiie 
 (Young Zee) 
 Get the dick 
 Yeah yeah yeah GET THE DICK 
 Yeah Bizarre yeah GET THE DICK 
 All you fuckers in Detroit GET THE DICK 
 Have you ever seen a show with niggas on the mic 
 With one minute rhymes that don't come out right 
 They bite, they never write, that's not polite 
 You dummies 
 The reason bitches want me to spend money 
 Just to spread 'em like Gin Rummy 
 I'm Ya Ya 
 Holier than Roshashana 
 With baby mama's that's pro black like the Sada 
 The lover large and at peace with his god 
 Behind bars, y'all nigga's sittin' close with the gaurds 
 Fucking with y'all, I'm always catchin charts 
 Y'all won't let us box, y'all wanna run and tell the Sarge 
 Life's short, I play hard 
 See your crew on the streets, 
 Better know I won't hesitate to spray y'all 
 I keep a rifle killing you and everybody looking like you 
 Fag, it's a never ending cycle 
 Can't nobody come and save you when I start shit 
 My lead is like Kryptonite to them Clark Kent's 
 I rip a crew with dust and liquor too 
 Too despicable 
 Toss you off the terace on ritaloo (ritual) 
 I rise like Christ 
 The third knight on mics 
 But it ain't Easter 
 It's only death when I meet you 
 So GET THE DICK
