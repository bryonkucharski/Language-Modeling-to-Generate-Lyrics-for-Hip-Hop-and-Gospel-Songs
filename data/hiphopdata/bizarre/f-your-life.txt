(Feat. Sindee Syringe) 
 (Intro: Sindee Syringe) 
 Whatsup people!? 
 This is Sindee Syringe! 
 We're here up in here snortin' sum lines! and we're all goin' straight to hell! 
 (Verse 1: Bizarre) 
 Man I pop so many pills, it's startin' to get scary! 
 (Woman: Bizarre, I'm your wife) Bitch, I ain't lairy! 
 And I don't give a fuck about pullin' out my dick, 
 Look at the name of my clit 
 It's D12 hoe! (Yeah, baby!) 
 It's D12 hoe! (Yeah, baby!) 
 Yeah, yeah, 
 Bizarre smoke atcha and got no problem, 
 For 10 hot dollars I fuck your bitch at the cavana (?) 
 VD, AIDs that's what Bizarre got, 
 For ten thousand michael jackson will give me a shot, 
 I sniff blow, high off a brick, 
 Crash into a ditch on 6-96. 
 Nasty nigga, quick to lick the finger, 
 Eat a bitch ass, that tastes like a butter finger, 
 And I'm going to hell for my nasty mouth, 
 But this is what Rock 'n' roll's all about. 
 (Chorus: Sindee Syringe) 
 I'm a psycho! And It's fucking with me again! 
 My dreams, my drugs, my life, my sins, Sindee Syringe... 
 We hate life, hate life, hate life, 
 Fuck your life! 
 I'm a psycho! And It's fucking with me again! 
 My dreams, my drugs, my life, my sins, Sindee Syringe... 
 We hate life, hate life, hate life, 
 Fuck your life! 
 (Verse 2: Bizarre) 
 Ever since I was a kid I had a violent past, 
 Whooped a nurse ass for touching my diaper rash! 
 And I ain't goin' work, I'm a lazy shit, 
 That's why I'm living warn with a fat white bitch 
 She's 36 and keeps a gun full of arsenal, 
 But son's 13, loves to listen to Marshall, 
 But I whoop his ass, and send him a school, 
 And let 'em know, that taking drugs is cool! 
 See I'm on sum dumb shit, don't know right from wrong, 
 All up on murder Inc. trying to get Ja Rule on a song. 
 And I used to be a virgin, grown-ass man, 
 Until I took a trip off to Neverland. 
 Mike gave me milk and cookies, showed me his room, 
 Kicked his ass over, I fucked 'I'm with a broom, 'cause... 
 (Chorus: Sindee Syringe) 
 I'm a psycho! And It's fucking with me again! 
 My dreams, my drugs, my life, my sins, Sindee Syringe... 
 We hate life, hate life, hate life, 
 Fuck your life! 
 I'm a psycho! And It's fucking with me again! 
 My dreams, my drugs, my life, my sins, Sindee Syringe... 
 We hate life, hate life, hate life, 
 Fuck your life! 
 (Verse 3: Bizarre) 
 All day I dream about sex, 
 Fucking handicap bitch, me, Proof and Hex! 
 And I don't give a fuck about no Britney Spears, 
 Just tie the bitch up, nut in her ears! 
 Bucks said when I'm a cash 'for I could get it for ten (?) 
 For the last three months you know where I been! 
 Snorting, shooting, getting a fix, 
 Got two Indian bitches in the motel 6 
 Four bags and twenty bears, 
 And I don't even know who the fuck D12 is! 
 I'm on the stage doing a lovesong, (forever...) 
 You'll fall, knowing damn well I'm wrong, 
 And I don't want no prostitute to have no sex, 
 I wanna bitch to break my neck, while I try to get her wet! 
 So, kids! Don't smoke no weed! 
 'Cause you'll end up just like me! 
 (Chorus: Sindee Syringe) 
 I'm a psycho! And It's fucking with me again! 
 My dreams, my drugs, my life, my sins, Sindee Syringe... 
 We hate life, hate life, hate life, 
 Fuck your life! 
 I'm a psycho! And It's fucking with me again! 
 My dreams, my drugs, my life, my sins, Sindee Syringe... 
 We hate life, hate life, hate life, 
 Fuck your life! 
 Nigga fuck you life! 
 Nigga! 
 Nigga fuck my life!
