Those haunting rhymes are keeping the time, 
 But they'll never get through to me. 
 It's my party, but I'm waiting for someone to start it. 
 It's my party, there's no one but me in the corner. 
 Gotta get my mojo runnin', engine hummin', don't I? 
 Now roll it up and smoke it again. 
 Now light me up and snort it again. 
 Now fix it up and shoot it again. 
 I can't believe I did it again. 
 Keep haunting me, taunting me, 
 But they'll never get through to me 
 It's my party, but I'm waiting for someone to start it 
 My party, there's blood on the ceiling, the carpet 
 Gotta get my mojo runnin', engine hummin', don't I? 
 Now roll it up and smoke it again. 
 It's bottoms up and drink it again. 
 Now fix it up and shoot it again. 
 I can't believe I did it again. 
 I'm readin' the signs, makes me wonder why they're getting through to me. 
 Gotta get my mojo runnin', engine hummin', don't I? 
 Gotta get my mojo runnin', engine hummin', don't I? 
 Now roll it up and smoke it again. 
 It's bottoms up and drink it again. 
 Now fix it up and shoot it again. 
 I can't believe I did it again. 
 Oops, I did it again
