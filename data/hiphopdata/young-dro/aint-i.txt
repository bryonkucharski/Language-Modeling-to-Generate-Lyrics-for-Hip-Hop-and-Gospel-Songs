Ya got to know the boy futuristic, ain't it? 
 My work can make the J's do the jump, man can't it? 
 You got to know this the remix right here 
 Grand Hustle baby it's the kings right here 
 You got to know we gwappin' pockets extra sloppy 
 Don't I love my vegetables extra cheese and broccoli? 
 Don't Yung L.A. like to kick it like karate? 
 Don't I be with J-money serving everybody? 
 Ain't we up in magic city throwing up the broccoli? 
 Ain't me and Tip taking off like a rocket? 
 Ain't my, ain't my, ain't my, ain't my, ain't my money long? 
 Ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I still putting on? 
 Ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I? 
 Ain't I smoking strong? Ain't I putting on? 
 Ain't I rocking yays? Ain't my money long? 
 Ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I? 
 Ain't I in the ville? Ain't I on the hill? 
 Ain't I on a pill? Ain't I, ain't I real? 
 Okay, my rims so big I'm at the tip top, ain't I? 
 Choppers in the trunk will make you do the Macarena 
 Pull up to the flo', yeah mothafucka ain't I? 
 All black coupe, I can buy a Benz, can't I? 
 Remix Yung L.A. and T.I., this a banger 
 Dro, you on that thang? You don't hear me Trick, ain't I? 
 Big Rolls Royces, ain't I got 'em nauseous? 
 We be in Ferraris, the cars with the horses 
 Ain't I on a pill riding down Bentley 
 Iced 30 below minus the wind chill 
 Ain't I packing chrome? Ain't I blowing strong? 
 Ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I got it going on? 
 Young Dro 
 Ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I?

 Ain't I rocking yays? Ain't my money long? 
 Ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I? 
 Ain't I in the ville? Ain't I on the hill? 
 Ain't I on a pill? Ain't I, ain't I real? 
 Ralph Lauren, purple label, ain't I fresh as I could be? 
 Made it through my situation, ain't I blessed as I could be? 
 Ain't I laughing at these haters tryna take a shot at me 
 They don't know which way to go, I make it easy, follow me 
 Honestly, ain't I insane? I think that's the way I gotta be 
 Ain't I so so super fly? Boy ain't nobody hot as me 
 Ain't T.I. all on TV when he wake up and go to sleep? 
 Everywhere they notice me, ay for yourself just go and see 
 My community I'm serving though they hope I don't succeed 
 Hear me speak they so intrigued, a-ain't he snitching? No indeed 
 You come with that common flow, yo show I have to commander 
 Since I see you can't take over I'll just have to volunteer 
 A-ain't I yo superior? Listen here bruh you not up here 
 I'm so zone 1 till it ain't funny twice the G that I appear 
 Rep Bankhead so loud and clear, go be gone for 'bout a year 
 So Paper Trail you gotta hear but ain't that Ain't I outta here? Ay! 
 Ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I? 
 Ain't I smoking strong? Ain't I putting on? 
 Ain't I rocking yays? Ain't my money long? 
 Ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I, ain't I? 
 Ain't I in the ville? Ain't I on the hill? 
 Ain't I on a pill? Ain't I, ain't I real?
