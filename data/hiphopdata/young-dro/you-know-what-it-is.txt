Welcome to the strip club 
 Pay ya admission 
 Ladies tell these niggas don't touch you 
 If they ain't tippin' 
 Tell a bitch don't criticize you 
 If they ain't strippin' 
 'Cause it's the way you livin' 
 Now move that ass 
 Shake that ass 
 Move it 
 Bounce it 
 Shake it baby 
 Drop it to the floor 
 If you throw it in his face 
 Mama then he gone spend some more 
 She ain't never had a job 
 She ain't ever worked before 
 But her ass crazy fat 
 And she know how to work the pole 
 And she smoke a lil' purp 
 And she do it after work 
 And she party all night 
 And talk all day on the chirp 
 Want me to come scoop her
