Extreme-aai 
 This system x2 (hey...) 
 Street my x2 
 Classic x3 
 Right about now x2 
 Come on, all tha ladies, 
 Get on tha dance floor 
 And just get ur ass on 
 Come on come on and just 
 Fuck tha fat lady, lean over to tha trap lady sane 
 Fish, scaleboy, nineteen eighty kane 
 Eighty chevey frame, ride 4 and everythang 
 Diamonds in my chain, shining on tha lane 
 (I want you to check this out, hey) 
 My car fusha, everything's super 
 Lights camera action, no time for bloopers 
 Fishscale shawty, I'm tha blue coop mover 
 Definitely lot of losers, snatching bro'd n used up 
 Show her how to blow on my glass, eighty cash 
 Eighty pecks of decks, and tha classical eighty jazz 
 Eighty bags of money, eighty macks from royne 
 A.K.A. they turning beef to eighty packs of bologne 
 They waited on me, telling when it's my time to cool it 
 Blue chevey sit tall, like a colorado moose do 
 My cookies drown like moons too, my regal look like prune juice 
 Why should I be bishop, I'm drizzled, I got my own juice 
 Own crew, own 26s on my own coop 
 Own crib, own bricks, plus I own a couple chicks 
 Know how to put bitches on they own, let her suck a dick 
 Hey one when one look biggin, they gotta be licking pussy 
 Money push it, bitch we got a avalanch block 
 With mo cocain then they can pull off of tha dock 
 Cut 'em off, viro ain't bitches ain't a thang 
 In tha chair with tha brains gettin' brains, diamonds on my chain
