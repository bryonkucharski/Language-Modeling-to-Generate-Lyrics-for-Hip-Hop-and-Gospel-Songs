Oh hi goddamn, brown Trans Am, I'm on fire 
 Loud as Cham', standing in the trap with these loud ass jems 
 Loud ass pipes, around these loud ass rims 
 God, God, look at my garage, Maserati cars 
 I can't see floors, this is no facade 
 Bitches go retard 
 Thousand pass we call that a picture in the yard 
 My paint keep falling, wet, wet shawty 
 "Shoulder Lean" money, I'm still balling 
 Got them soldiers in the tomb, pockets overload 
 Stack my money up and take a rocket to the moon 
 AK in the freezer, ready to put my glasses in the room 
 When I get with these hoes, first we pop it then we sue them 
 The hottest in the room, you know I won't lie 
 You know I'm sitting tall, you know I'm on fire 
 Call me Young Dro Because I'm smoking on fire 
 Ball if you want, please shawty don't try 
 Players only live once, everybody going to die 
 So whatever shawty want, you know shawty going to buy 
 Aye, but shawty on fa, fa, fa, on fire 
 Shawty on fa, fa, fa, on fire 
 Shawty on fa, fa, fa, on fire 
 Shawty on fa, fa, fa, on fire 
 Call me Young Dro because I'm smoking on fire (X4) 
 I am Young Dro, what you telling me? 
 Pocket full of celery, I know how to be a player 
 I am V. Delery, nigga run up on me wrong know I get a felony 
 Damn fresh in the club, damn who they asking me? 
 Fellas be trying see my cars look like my Automart 
 Rovers in the crowd and I don't know how to call them up 
 I'ma start a hundred cars, race them up, paid them up 
 (Incomprehensible) grey in March, Uncle Blue in April, dimes in the stable 
 Gators I'ma blow them out 
 Tell the bitches if they don't behave I'ma throw them out 
 Drop top probable, make it rain on the Doppler 
 Grand Hustle king got a mafia, nigga what's popping? 
 I'm a beast, soon as I hit release mode 
 Pop your open like the Lamborghini doors 
 Young Dro I'm the "Best Thang Smokin 
 On fire, on fire, on fire, on fire 
 Riding down Edgecombe, I just left Zaxby's 
 Chickens at the restaurant, chickens in my Chevy trunk 
 Classic, super straight, Dro you cannot duplicate 
 Nigga you ain't hustle till you sold it out the Super 8 
 Traveloid, super cake, do a hundred jazz up 
 Super strong kush got them coughing like the swap meet 
 (Incomprehensible) 
 Dro you say you spent a million on the jewelry 
 Who you lying to? Try who? 
 Nigga I will suffocate and bust the K 
 Show them how to cultivate, and buy a house with ocean state 
 Plus I say I'm real with the hustle I multicate 
 First they start biting, I require y'all muzzle they 
 Mouth is doubt me, eight mile high houses 
 Grand Hustle king y'all know what I'm about bitch
