Take me to your mama's for dinner 
 Take me to your mama's for rice and beans 
 Take me to your mama's for dinner 
 When I show up twice she'll know what that means 
 Take me to your mama's for dinner 
 Take me to your mama's for rice and beans 
 Take me to your mama's for dinner 
 When I show up twice she'll know what that means 
 Hola, Amigo 
 Pollo con sofrito 
 Blowin' up my libido 
 Explodin' my torpedo 
 Take me to 191 and St. Nicholas 
 You got it ridiculous 
 *Laughs* Watch out, I'm ticklish 
 Toss your ensalada 
 Stuff your empinada 
 I like a big umbrella on my Pina Colada 
 With Jorge, Ricardo, Cesar, Eduardo 
 Let's make the sweat drip on el piso majado 
 Take me to your mama's for dinner 
 Take me to your mama's for rice and beans 
 Take me to your mama's for dinner 
 When I show up twice she'll know what that means 
 Take me to your mama's for dinner 
 Take me to your mama's for rice and beans 
 Take me to your mama's for dinner 
 When I show up twice she'll know what that means 
 Hola, Amigo 
 Pollo son soy frio 
 Blowin' up my libido 
 Explodin' my torpedo 
 If I knew how to get you out of those jeans 
 We'd be ripping the seams 
 From Spanish Harlem to Queens 
 Bass drums, I got it 
 Condoms, I brought it 
 My *groans*, I shot it 
 You're the host 
 With the most 
 We got dos platanos 
 We're spreading muslos 
 Like it's butter on toast 
 Take me to your mama's for dinner 
 (All right, I'm ready) 
 Take me to your mama's for rices and beans 
 (Know what I mean) 
 Take me to your mama's for dinner 
 (All right, I'm ready) 
 When I show up twice she'll know what that means 
 (So what's it mean?) 
 Take me to your mama's for dinner 
 (All right, I'm ready) 
 Take me to your mama's for rices and beans 
 (Know what I mean) 
 Take me to your mama's for dinner 
 (All right, I'm ready) 
 When I show up twice she'll know what that means 
 (So what's it mean?)
