(If you came to party, throw your hands up 
 It's Saturday night, time to shake that ass...) 
 Oh my God! 
 How do you get this track on your iPod? 
 How do you get the sweat stain out of my Izod? 
 Watch it playa' 
 I'm comin' through you can say a prayer 
 Hummin' all night and all day'a 
 With the CD playa's 
 It's time for the perculator 
 Don't believe me? Ask the hater 
 Da maya', whos' headin' down to clubs on the escalator 
 Get my money back, get my money back 
 Get my money back, get my money back 
 Get my money back, get my money back 
 Get my money back, get my money back 
 Get my money back, get my money back 
 Get my money back, get my money back 
 Get my money back, get my money back 
 (Get my money back 
 Get my money back 
 Get my money back 
 Get my money back) 
 I'm going down, da, da, da down 
 Below the Canal Street side of town 
 With the fake old chains, gin in my veins 
 Got a porno movie settin' on my brain 
 Wha' 
 Don't act like you didn't know 
 Got a hole in my crotch when I start the show 
 I know the crowd saw me pick my nose 
 I got a monkey in my pants, watch how it grows 
 Get my money back, get my money back 
 Get my money back, get my money back 
 Get my money back, get my money back 
 Get my money back, get my money back 
 Get my money back, get my money back 
 Get my money back, get my money back 
 Get my money back, get my money back 
 (Get my money back) 
 I can't be, and I won't be stopped 
 We pop it off till the big beats drop 
 And I can't be, and I won't be stopped 
 Bitch don't try it, try it, try it 
 Can't be, and I won't be stopped 
 We pop it off till the big beats drop 
 And I can't be, and I won't be stopped 
 You can't buy it, buy it, buy it 
 Get my money back, get my money back 
 Get my money back, get my money back 
 Get my money back, get my money back 
 Get my money back, get my money back 
 Get my money back, get my money back 
 Get my money back, get my money back 
 Get my money back, get my money back 
 (Get my money back) 
 Y'all so stupid 
 All you gotta do is find this beat and loop it 
 Put it in the backpack of some cute kid 
 Who gave it to the DJ, to just reboot it 
 Made a gun, two fingers and a thumb 
 To get my money back, get my money back 
 Took a bite, from a cool Big Mac 
 Don't try me jack 
 Give you and your crew an anxiety attack 
 Get my money back, get my money back 
 Get my money back, get my money back 
 Get my money back, get my money back 
 Get my money back, get my money back 
 Get my money back, get my money back 
 Get my money back, get my money back 
 Get my money back, get my money back 
 (Get my money back 
 Get my money back 
 Get my money back 
 Get my money back) 
 I wanna know can get my money back
