Amanda Lepore: 
 Get into it, get into it, get into it... 
 Cazwell: 
 Yeah, all the fresh kids know my name by now 
 I'm the C.A.Z, W.E., whatever 
 This beat is clever 
 I'm a freak forever 
 My wallets getting fat 
 But you already knew that 
 Some of you love me 
 And some of you hate me 
 Some wanna date me 
 Some wanna date rape me 
 I'm trashy and flashy and feelin' fine 
 Hittin' in the K holes in 99 
 Just press rewind 
 To see what I'm seein' 
 I get a kiss on both cheeks European (ooh) 
 Black, white, puertoreqan, interacial 
 Manicure, pedicure, aim for my facial 
 I stretch my rhymes like an elastic 
 And I clean for kicks is fantastic 
 This club scene drama I'm past it 
 You a trend about to end 
 I'm classic 
 Ugh (club scene drama) 
 Ugh (club scene drama) 
 Ugh (club scene drama) 
 Ugh (club scene drama) 
 Amanda Lepore: 
 Get into it, Get into it 
 (You want it baby) 
 Get into it, Get into it 
 (Get on it baby) 
 Get into it, Get into it 
 (Flawless baby) 
 Get into it, into it 
 Into it, into it 
 Get into it, Get into it 
 (You want it baby) 
 Get into it, Get into it 
 (Get on it baby) 
 Get into it, Get into it 
 (Flawless baby) 
 Get into it, into it 
 Into it, into it 
 Cazwell: 
 We went from vaiders to DVD players 
 Shootin' space invaders eliquant tomb raiders 
 Clipon pagers to motorola razors 
 All these pre interpratators 
 Callin' teasin' aligators 
 All these haters 
 Are just impersinators 
 If you can't rock the mic 
 Without ducking from teenaders 
 We come familiar to your face turns blue 
 Only 2 times 2 like your under my shoe 
 This track played out like a tribal tattoo 
 On 8th avenue 
 Sad but true 
 I'm newer than new 
 And nower than now 
 And if you wanna get into what I'm talking about 
 I said it before 
 When I walked through the door 
 From Amandaliere to Amanda Lepore 
 Amanda Lepore: 
 Ugh, ugh, ugh... 
 Get into it, Get into it 
 (You want it baby) 
 Get into it, Get into it 
 (Get on it baby) 
 Get into it, Get into it 
 (Flawless baby) 
 Get into it, into it 
 Into it, into it 
 Get into it, Get into it 
 (You want it baby) 
 Get into it, Get into it 
 (Get on it baby) 
 Get into it, Get into it 
 (Flawless baby) 
 Get into it, into it 
 Into it, into it 
 Get into these lips 
 Get into these hips 
 I get into my shashay slip by slip 
 You sit next to me 
 And you ask for my number 
 The clubs I work and how much is the cover 
 I'm a blonde nuematic with one thing on my mind 
 My hair piece, so do not touch the hair please 
 I'd like a chair please 
 It's time to perch 
 I rock on the go go box till it hurts 
 Here's how it works 
 You heard of me 
 Drag queen stands to me in Germany 
 I got major fans in Amsterdam 
 Club hits in Japan, know who I am 
 I'm the #1 transsexual on the planet 
 And you can't stand it 
 God damn it 
 Respect I demand and my two best friends 
 With my Christian Louboutin's 110's 
 Cunt 
 Ugh (Cunt), ugh (cunt), ugh (cunt) 
 Ugh, ugh, ugh... 
 Get into it, Get into it 
 (You want it baby) 
 Get into it, Get into it 
 (Get on it baby) 
 Get into it, Get into it 
 (Flawless baby) 
 Get into it, into it 
 Into it, into it 
 Get into it, Get into it 
 (You want it baby) 
 Get into it, Get into it 
 (Get on it baby) 
 Get into it, Get into it 
 (Flawless baby) 
 Get into it, into it 
 Into it, into it 
 Into It, into It 
 You Want it baby 
 Yeah, huh 
 It ends now 
 Uh huh
