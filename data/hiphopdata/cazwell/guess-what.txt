 Cazwell: 
 Stick um up, up, up 
 More vodka in my cup, cup, cup 
 Half the internet like whut, whut, whut 
 In the butt on Craig's list 
 Stamp on my wrist 
 69 on my guest list 
 Guess this 
 Luciana this chick 
 Hot like a wick 
 On the rise like bisquik 
 Mydick thick 
 I'm so narcissistic 
 Brand new trick, hit me up in my district 
 Both:

 You know you got it 
 Guess what? You know I want it!

 Cazwell:

 Here's a posish you might find apauling 
 Won't let lose the juice I'm stalling 
 Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it 
 Believe me, I'm easy 
 Just blow me like it's breezy 
 Don't stop you pop my teepee 
 On drop I'm pop my seedlings, huh? 
 Luciana: 
 You do things to me 
 (Like what?) 
 That I cannot pronunce 
 (Ooh that!) 
 I'm takin' scores 
 Kissin' raw 
 See me rubbin' out 
 You want it good 
 Bet you wish you could 
 I'm buring rubber 
 With a love boy 
 And boy he's good 
 Cazwell: 
 Drop click and drag me 
 Want but you can't have me 
 Take a picture, tag me, tag me, tag me 
 Drop click and drag me 
 Want but you can't have me

 Cazwell: 
 Stop! 
 Drop that roll I'm ready 
 Hot and sweary 
 Pop the confetti 
 Gas like getty 
 I'm sittin' pretty 
 Roll about 20 deep with my own committee 
 Got my name blowin' up all around the city 
 Sippin' perrier while another major bid me 
 Right through security concealing um 
 And you must feel dirty your feelin' up 
 Stuck back in the baggy and seelin' um 
 So high in the sky like helium 
 The same bank heads that come at me bitter 
 Are the same snake heads that follow me on twitter 
 Yeah, I shine so much you think I shit out glitter 
 Rabies got bit by the babysitter 
 Still the last of the litter and a mystery 
 Oops, time for me to clear my history!
