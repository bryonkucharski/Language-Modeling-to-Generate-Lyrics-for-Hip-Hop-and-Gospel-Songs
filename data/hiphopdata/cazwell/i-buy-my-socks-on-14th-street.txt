Hey! 
 Time to get up, will you hand me my slippers? 
 And I'll take my orange juice in a brandy snifter 
 I'm a great lover and a better listener 
 Huh? What? Did you say somethin'? Were you talking to me? 
 All I see is used condom wrappers on the floor 
 Tricks' numbers on post-its by the door 
 I'll only call back if I want some more 
 And that's the life I live when I'm not on tour 
 You knew I was the new Don Juan when you saw me 
 And you smelled the co-log-ne I just sprayed on me 
 And I know I'm nice 
 Santa don't have to check his list twice 
 Here's some advice don't share your keys 
 Or you might end up with Hepatitis B 
 Buy my CD, mind your Q's and P's 
 And always say "Cheese" for the paparazzis 
 See I don't really care what people think 
 And I don't really care what people do 
 See you don't know me and I don't know you 
 And what? And what? And what? And what? 
 When I hopped the train I always take the seat 
 I don't remember the names of the people I meet 
 I don't need a car because I got two feet 
 And I buy my socks on 14th Street 
 Why's everybody always looking at me? 
 Is it 'cause I jerk off for my webcam for free? 
 'Cause I'm picking my nose when I'm thinking somethin' 
 And pullin' the lint out my belly button? 
 (Hey!) I came from Massachusetts and I don't give two shits 
 Watch me pop two zits in your grits 
 I got enthusiasm of a muscle spasm 
 And I'm gonna show my magic wism-rasm-ma-tasm-and-chizasm 
 Yeah, I'm truckin' fast 
 Sweating like my ass crack in yoga class 
 So pass that dutch, I wanna get fucked up 
 Until the sun goes down and comes back up 
 Then goes back down and comes back up 
 Then down, then down, then down, and up! 
 Have you had enough or do you want some more? 
 I put my Adidas Magnums on and I'm out the door 
 See I don't really care what people think 
 And I don't really care what people do 
 See you don't know me and I don't know you 
 And what? And what? And what? And what? 
 When I hopped the train I always take the seat 
 I don't remember the names of the people I meet 
 I don't need a car because I got two feet 
 And I buy my socks on 14th Street 
 So I'm on 14th Street, right? 
 And my look head to toe is tight 
 Till I hit the highway on the west end 
 I bumped into one of my shady friend 
 His name is Jake from way upstate 
 He wants to know if I'll take some Peruvian flakes 
 He said "Make it hot, take a ride in my car!" 
 I said 'Let me think about that for about 8 bars' 
 "No I don't think so, I gotta buy some socks though 
 I'll party tonight when the mood is right 
 Just get the hood and don't be a hater 
 I'll be out tonight", "All right, catch you later" 
 See I don't really care what people think 
 And I don't really care what people do 
 See you don't know me and I don't know you 
 And what? And what? And what? And what? 
 When I hopped the train I always take the seat 
 I don't remember the names of the people I meet 
 I don't need a car because I got two feet 
 And I buy my socks on 14th Street
