 [Verse 1] - Cazwell 
 I seen Beyonce at Burger King 
 She ordered two cheeseburgers with onion rings 
 She got a chocolate shake, with a side of fries 
 Chicken strips, with apple pies 
 Yeah, I seen Beyonce at Burger King 
 She ordered two cheeseburgers with onion rings 
 She got a chocolate shake, with a side of fries 
 And she looked dead in my eyes and she says 
 "Can I borrow ten dollars? I left my purse in the car 
 In the car 
 It's parked three blocks away and baby that's just too far 
 Too far" 
 "Okay but you gotta pay me back if you borrow 
 And have my ten dollars when I see you tomorrow 
 No acting funny" 
 Said "Caz, would I lie to you?" 
 Then smiled, then snatched my money and said

 I seen Beyonce at JC Penney 
 She rolled up in a '94 Chevy 
 She screeched up in the handicap 
 Applying chapstick with her B-phone on her lap 
 She says "Can you watch my car? 
 I gotta run in to buy a quick something 
 For me and my man" 
 I said "I can, but you still owe me ten ducket" 
 She rolled her eyes and said "fuck it" I said

 I seen beyonce at the liquor store 
 She completely ignored me walking through the door 
 She had her Freakum Dress on 
 From the House of Derion 
 And was patting her weave ladies with her palm 
 She was looking around for some customer service 
 I walked up to her and made security nervous 
 She says "How much for a case of beer?" 
 I says "Girl, are you drunk? I don't work here!"
