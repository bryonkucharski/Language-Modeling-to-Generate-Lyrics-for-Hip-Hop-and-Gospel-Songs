Watch my mouth 
 Read my lips 
 Shake that ass 
 And move your hips 
 Watch my mouth 
 Read my lips 
 Watch my mouth, watch my mouth 
 Watch my mouth 
 Do you see what I'm sayin'? 
 Watch my mouth 
 You know we ain't playin' 
 Watch my mouth 
 Your booty's obeying 
 Watch my mouth, watch my mouth 
 Let's get the party started 
 On the floor 
 'Cause if ya paid the cover 
 That's what ya came for 
 Shake that asset 
 Move your feet 
 And watch me get it started 
 To the west end beat 
 If you like it 
 Lick it 
 Slurb it 
 Slide it 
 Shake it 
 Bake it 
 Stir it 
 Fry it 
 Scream my name out 
 As you ride it 
 (I'm so excited and I just can't hide it) 
 DJ drop the needle and (turn it up) 
 Jump on the dance floor and (stir it up) 
 Just take what is down and (work it up) 
 (Honey 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) 
 DJ drop the needle and (turn it up) 
 Jump on the dance floor and (stir it up) 
 Just take what is down and (work it up) 
 (Honey 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) 
 Watch my mouth 
 Read my lips 
 Shake that ass 
 And move your hips 
 Watch my mouth 
 Read my lips 
 Watch my mouth, watch my mouth 
 Watch my mouth 
 Do you see what I'm sayin'? 
 Watch my mouth 
 You know we ain't playin' 
 Watch my mouth 
 Your booty's obeying 
 Watch my mouth 
 Watch my mouth 
 See what I'm talking about 
 From another small town 
 To the dirty south 
 From the east coast playa's 
 Who are drinkin' wine 
 To the west coast playa's 
 Workin' on their tan line 
 That's party on 
 The kids are gone 
 Rolled up 
 Passed out 
 On your 
 Mamma's lawn 
 Not even your folks 
 Would get up in this 
 Let's get busy 
 Like it's no one's business 
 DJ drop the needle and (turn it up) 
 Jump on the dance floor and (stir it up) 
 Just take what is down and (work it up) 
 (Honey 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) 
 DJ drop the needle and (turn it up) 
 Jump on the dance floor and (stir it up) 
 Just take what is down and (work it up) 
 (Honey 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) 
 Watch my mouth 
 Read my lips 
 Shake that ass 
 And move your hips 
 Watch my mouth 
 Read my lips 
 Watch my mouth, watch my mouth 
 Watch my mouth 
 Do you see what I'm sayin'? 
 Watch my mouth 
 You know we ain't playin' 
 Watch my mouth 
 Your booty's obeying 
 Watch my mouth, watch my mouth 
 Shake that asset 
 Move your feet 
 And keep on 
 Stepping to the beat (all right!) 
 Let's get loose 
 Up down 
 Down down 
 Move your arms 
 Over your feet 
 And spin around 
 Shake that asset 
 Move your feet 
 And keep on 
 Stepping to the beat (get down, down) 
 Let's get loose 
 Up down 
 Down down 
 Move your arms 
 Over your feet 
 And spin around 
 Watch my mouth 
 Read my lips 
 Shake that ass 
 And move your hips 
 Watch my mouth 
 Read my lips 
 Watch my mouth, watch my mouth 
 Watch my mouth 
 Do you see what I'm sayin'? 
 Watch my mouth 
 You know we ain't playin' 
 Watch my mouth 
 Your booty's obeying 
 Watch my mouth, watch my mouth
