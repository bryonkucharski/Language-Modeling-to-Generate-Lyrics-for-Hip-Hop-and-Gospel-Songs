Manila Luzon: 
 Yaaaaaassssss 
 Helen Keller! 
 I got pro nails 
 On my toe nails 
 With a weave cut down 
 To my coat tails 
 When the boat sails 
 Get ready 
 Line up the eyeliner 
 Steady 
 Where's my foundation? 
 I'm impatient 
 My rice gets sticky 
 When my man's on probation 
 I give him yellow fever 
 A believer 
 Hand on the stick 
 Of my pink 
 Two-seater 
 He can't get enough 
 Of this siamese 
 Kitty cat 
 He can't stick into an 
 Itty bitty jimmy hat 
 He's my Bruce Lee 
 Don't stop me 
 Get the fuck off me 
 Brew me 
 Some coffee 
 Let the bygones 
 Be bygones 
 Queen of Saigon 
 McQueen nylons 
 Face by Kryolan 
 Don't try me hunny 
 I'll go to jail 
 I got the bail money 
 Cazwell: 
 I don't see her 
 Helen Keller 
 I don't see her 
 Helen Keller 
 I don't see her, I don't see her, I don't see her 
 Helen Keller 
 I don't see her 
 Helen Keller 
 I don't see her 
 Helen Keller 
 I don't see her, I don't see her, I don't see her 
 Helen Keller 
 Someone call Candy Finnigan 
 My addictions 
 About to begin again 
 Got my balls slappin' 
 On your chin again 
 For longer than 
 Gone with the wind again 
 Then 
 Again 
 Called it quits 
 Chopped your head 
 Zipped you up in a space bag 
 Under my bed 
 Now I know 
 Where you are 
 When I need you 
 Break out the brail 
 Helen Keller 
 Gonna read you 
 I don't see her 
 I don't hear her either 
 I disappeared to the sun in Ibiza 
 Layin' outside 
 Where 
 The tall palm trees 
 Are 
 Givin' y'all more 
 Dark marks 
 Where your knees are 
 Ya went from my green room 
 To the steam room 
 Kicked your ass 
 Out the house 
 'Cause I need room 
 Now I got that bitch 
 Locked in the cellar 
 That's why I don't see her 
 Helen Keller 
 I don't see her 
 Helen Keller 
 I don't see her 
 Helen Keller 
 I don't see her, I don't see her, I don't see her 
 Helen Keller 
 I don't see her 
 Helen Keller 
 I don't see her 
 Helen Keller 
 I don't see her, I don't see her, I don't see her

 Manila Luzon: 
 Fuck it gets better 
 It gets gorgeous 
 Patience thin 
 Heart enormous 
 My girls in the club 
 Can't ignore us 
 Track just dropped 
 Learn the chorus 
 Champagne 
 For effervescence 
 F train 
 Under bright fluorescents 
 Lipstick fuck anti depressants 
 Wash my hair with Herbal Essence 
 Don't see me 
 Outta luck boss 
 Layer this beat 
 Extra duck sauce 
 Get that lovin' 
 Spread that muffin 
 Heat the run 
 In an easy bake oven 
 Boys on my mind, coins on my mind 
 Annoyed by my grind 
 I'm one of a kind 
 Eye of the tiger 
 Leo my sign 
 Wanna sip this cider? 
 Get in line bitch! 
 Cazwell: 
 Rewind bitch 
 My time bitch 
 See me on twitter 
 Instagram and vine, bitch 
 Fuck with me? 
 That's a hella nope 
 You couldn't see me 
 With a telescope 
 The only dial you'll be gettin' 
 Is some yellow soap 
 To wash that rachet ass twice 
 I know I'm nice 
 (Listen) 
 I admit I'm a bit vain 
 That's 'cause I'm in the shit 
 You a shit stain 
 Cheat twice then split 
 Ain't she changed 
 Caught the clap like that 
 Ain't shit strange 
 All I need is my name 
 I don't wanna clear it 
 All you want is fame 
 But ain't no where near it 
 Wanna play a love game 
 I don't wanna hear it 
 Plus you dead to me now 
 And I don't talk to spirits 
 Still trill 
 Ill will 
 Fresh on kilter 
 Picture that 
 Hashtag 
 No filter 
 I don't see her 
 Helen Keller 
 I don't see her 
 Helen Keller 
 I don't see her, I don't see her, I don't see her 
 Helen Keller 
 I don't see her 
 Helen Keller 
 I don't see her 
 Helen Keller 
 I don't see her, I don't see her, I don't see her 
 Helen Keller 
 Manila Luzon: 
 We're done 
 I don't see you 
 I don't hear you 
 We're through 
 I've helen kellered 
 Your ass 
 Buh-by!
