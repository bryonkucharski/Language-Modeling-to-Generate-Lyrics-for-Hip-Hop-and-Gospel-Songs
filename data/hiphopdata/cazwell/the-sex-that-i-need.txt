Avenue D: 
 The Latin explosion ain't new to me 
 I've been into foreskin since puberty 
 I want an uncut Latino with a libido 
 The size of Reno, Nevada to bang me 
 Till My bladder splatters 
 A dick fatter than a beer can 
 Lay down, stand 
 Or in the back of his van 
 He sports Tommy, Adidas 
 Fubu, Timberland 
 Pinky ring on his hand 
 His wish is my command 
 I'll suck his dick on the can 
 Or on the Puerto Rican sand 
 That's my man with the nice clean fade 
 And when he gets paid, I get paid 
 And when I get laid, I'm glad he stayed 
 'Cause there's nothin' like more than foreskin 
 I drop my chin so I can fit it all in 
 And then he eats my ass 
 Like he eats rice and beans 
 Until the plate's clean 
 You know what I mean? 
 Cazwell: 
 Yes, I do, just the other day 
 I got a blowjob from a hoe job 
 With no job 
 Seen him at the bar 
 Battin' his eyelashes 
 Show me where your cash is 
 I'll show where my stash is 
 His ass is on my bed 
 The head board hit his head 
 Till his head turned red 
 In and out was the motion 
 KY was the lotion 
 And that's the way it goes girl 
 When you fuck until your toes curl 
 I rocked his world 
 With mad stamina 
 Hot like panama 
 Shot like an enema 
 I'm sending your ass back to the store to get some rubbers 
 So I change the covers 
 Avenue D: 
 This is the kind of man that I want 
 This is the kind of sex that I need 
 This is the kind of man that I want 
 This is the kind of sex that I need 
 This is the kind of man that I want 
 This is the kind of sex that I need 
 This is the kind of man that I want 
 This is the kind of sex that I need 
 Well, it won't be long 
 Before he takes off my thong 
 (But it wasn't a thong until you put it on) 
 Shut the fuck up 
 I'm the one getting laid here 
 He's back from the bodega 
 With a case of beer and a bag of weed 
 So I'm on my knees pulling out the seeds 
 He wants to squeeze my 34Bs 
 Until I can't breathe 
 Someone pass the poppers and a bottle of lube 
 Before he bangs me from the back 
 With his rough rider attitude the routine 
 We fuck on the rug so the sheets stay clean 
 Damn, my man is heaven sent 
 He got me horny like the ex president 
 Just thinking of my man's big dick in my face 
 And then he cums in my face 
 And then runs out of the place 
 I don't care, he'll be back 
 'Cause he loves this ass 
 And when he's done his friends'll be over fast 
 You got a problem with me? 
 You should get your ass off of Avenue D. 
 Cazwell: 
 See you like the type of guy that works at the pizza place 
 Sweat on his face mustache above his lips 
 Open shirt, gold chain and a crucifix 
 I like the type of guy that east vil style 
 Chill for a while if he's versatile 
 But the bottom direction give me his ass 
 And give me affection 
 Did I happen to mention? 
 (No, I don't think you did) 
 Well, I like to keep my man in the 718 
 'Cause I'm in the 212 and got things to do 
 (Like what?) 
 Like whatever, I wanna leave this 
 With no shame 
 Behind me 
 But all I see is his name on my caller ID 
 Which reminds me of the time we took three ecstasy 
 You know, one things leads to another 
 I see him on the weekends 
 (What about the weekdays?) 
 That's when I'm busy messin' with his brother
