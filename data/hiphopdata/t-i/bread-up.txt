Verse:(scarface) 
 I got it mapped 
 I'm gone make sumthim shake 
 Run up on somebody wit dis chrome 38 
 Put it in his face 
 For broke muthafuckas 
 Broke niggas can't wait 
 To catch you when you was sleep 
 And get cha fa ya safe aye 
 The game ... 
 I was raised around the life 
 Where the houshold is broke up and and mamas on tha pipe 
 And the fuck'd up thing is ya brother sold her dope 
 And ya mamas was at the doe every time she had to scoe mo' 
 You ain't know tha lil homie poitty did cha?
