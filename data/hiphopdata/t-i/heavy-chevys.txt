 Big Kuntry: 
 Now how you tame a young baller 
 That rides Surburbans, Caprises 
 Candy Impalas, Rasberry Monte Carlos 
 That barks like a rottweiler 
 Off the collar 
 Addicted to hustlin 
 And stackin mighty dollars 
 O holla 
 When you hear the Chevy beatin' down the street 
 Beatin' so hard 
 The chris is wastin on my mink seats 
 To get a rim posted corner 
 Call me 10 G's 
 The same as the Chevy platinum emblem on my keys 
 Wit the diamond against the trim 
 A young ass nigga wit a Louis V rim 
 A sporty young shorty wit the Gucci shades dim 
 These hoes mistaken me for being they pimp 
 They said baby couldn't see you pass them shiny rims 
 I'ma cool little daddy

 And if you choose a hoe you need to hop on in 
 And if you ain't bitch you need to ride wit him

 AK:

 You gon feel something hot to the third degree 
 Coming down yo street in a black capris 
 Wit a fine ass freak in the passengers seat 
 Y'all fake niggas don't know the half of me 
 I spit pimp game automatically 
 Don't be mad at me 
 'Cause I'm finally coming up in the industry 
 And the 44 singing on the triple D's 
 Plug not the underground celebrities 
 Mac Bone my partna keepin' the beat 
 Heat it up like a cook out 
 When the sun falls 
 Y'all niggas better look out 
 Your rap careers over 
 I put a hook down 
 Like you better pallow 
 Ride and swerve while my niggas follow 
 Hoes wobblin and start slobbin 
 Bobbin on the dick until they swallow 
 Mac Boney: 
 Speedometer, broken doors 
 Smokin' body, dented windows 
 Tinted bended round the corner leanin 
 In the steamin screamin demons 
 Spillin liquor, yeah nigga 
 Blowin' tall off the wall 
 Burning rubber leavin' foul 
 Muthafucka how you ride 
 Choppin blades wit triple golds 
 Stay away from camilton rolls 
 Playa 'cause I'm riding old

 Jack it up, strip it down

 Big Kuntry:

 Diggin up ya grass 
 Drag racin four fifty four

 And I mash on it in a flash 
 Throw it in the gutter 
 Buy another if it crash 
 That's petty cash 
 Big Kuntry:

 Pearsjay wit a face bright as heavens day

 Hit the store then for some more Hen (Hey Dub)
