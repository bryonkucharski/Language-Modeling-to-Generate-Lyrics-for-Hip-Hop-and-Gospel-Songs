 For that bread I be in your house like 
 I go deaf ears if it ain't about no dough 
 Porsche mind state this my Panamera flow 
 Offshore Royal oak, I got diamonds in 'em 
 Gucci jean suit, keep a couple thousand in 'em 
 Came up hard, handle food in the refrigerator 
 Now these haters can't breath need a respirator 
 Women beep me every time they see me 
 Sippin' DP on my way to DC 
 Ask niggas out in Florida they know me well 
 Pretty bitches say I'm crazy out in ACL 
 F-ck the bullshit baby I'm about mine 
 Champagne in the air, it's about time

 Bitch I'm getting money like the end getting closer 
 Money on my mind, p-ssy on my radar 
 Bitch I'm getting paid, I'm on my Bernie Madoff 
 Money talks, bullshit walks, cut the legs off 
 Aim at your egg, turn that shit to eggnog 
 And if I fall, my money is my cushion 
 Niggas can't see me like they not looking 
 To the red flag, a pledge of allegiance 
 Y'all bitches don't want beef like vegans 
 I don't have a care and if I do I take care of it 
 Haters dead waiting I ain't with that pall bearer shit 
 Never played lotto, I don't believe in luck 
 They tried to send me sugar, wasn't sweet enough

 I'm about to ride by hanging out the Benz 
 We getting money like we never heard of the feds 
 The black Bentley Coupe rollin' like the Batmobile 
 I feel 8 feet tall man I'm Shaq O'neil 
 I'm about guap baby, I'm about cake 
 Push the button in the doors to about face
