I come apart babe, but now I'm fine 
 I'm checkin' trouble sure, moving down the line 
 I come apart baby, but that's ok cause 
 Trouble man, don't get in my way 
 I'm just a hood nigga I ain't never had shit 
 Just a bad attitude and a bad bitch 
 Duffle back full of tools and a half brick 
 30, 40, 50 grand in the mattress 
 Living on the edge jus a habit dawg 
 I'm fucked up in the head I don't have it all 
 Ball like a dog push it to the limit 
 Bout my business trynna keep from letting pussy niggas in it 
 My priorities is follow, God first then the fam, 
 Then the hustle, then the money, failure ain't in the plan 
 Satan on my heel he don't want me to advance 
 I tell him go to hell sucka catch me if you can 
 Shit I am who I am, fresh up out of apologies 
 Sometimes I ain't get in trouble trouble got in me 
 Guess it follows me but I stays on my hustle man 
 Still the motherfuckin man you can call me, Trouble Man 
 Trouble man, I always in trouble man 
 Grand hustle man, I'm the motherfuckin man 
 Trouble Man, stays in some trouble man 
 Bank rolls, rubber band, you can call me Trouble Man 
 Trouble man, I always in trouble man 
 Grand hustle man, I'm the motherfuckin man 
 Trouble Man, stays in some trouble man 
 Bank rolls, rubber band, you can call me Trouble Man 
 Drugs 'n' rock 'n' roll, ho you know how I roll 
 Just left the crossroads, my soul, unsold 
 Frigerated console, the curtains on my car door 
 Raw ho, caviar, sushi and escargot 
 Everywhere I go fresh to death and clean as a bar of soap 
 Getting blowed like trumpets in the wind in Chicago 
 God knows I'm hot as El Diablo 
 Wrist rockier than Colorado off-road 
 Also my flows I'm taking back although 
 My art's so Leonardo Da Vinci Picasso 
 The rain gone come down on your head like tarp holes 
 I guess these other rappers that's cool as far as soft goes 
 Sorry Charlie party's over shorty shop closed 
 King home, bank roll on King Kong 
 Got these suckas in my scope with the beam on 
 Prayin' for my downfall you can dream on 
 Make sure I'm back in the Maybach gettin' my lean on 
 Trouble ain't changed me, role model ain't me 
 Don't be angry now if I'm on the same street 
 Make a U turn haven't you learned I'm, Trouble Man 
 Trouble man, I always in trouble man 
 Grand hustle man, I'm the motherfuckin man 
 Trouble Man, stays in some trouble man 
 Bank rolls, rubber band, you can call me Trouble Man 
 Weight on my shoulders chose to squat with it 
 Real niggas say I kick it the same way Pac did it 
 Tell all them sucka nigga what the bizz is 
 Upset 'cause they can't do they thang like he did here 
 Shit, another year another deal done 
 No chump change big bank millions 
 Ya, my money old but I'm still young 
 Them nigga lookin' for some drama I'm a give 'em some 
 No more beef a pimp will say goodbye to red meat 
 But cross a nigga path and your dead meat 
 Remain on my gang time, after time 
 '97 college bass head, 99 dime 
 '98 have provisions on 2-85 flyin 
 Skip where you meet KP and L.A Reid got signed 
 Cut to the present and the rap game mine 
 Some things never change it remains I'm, Trouble Man 
 Trouble man, I always in trouble man 
 Grand hustle man, I'm the motherfuckin man 
 Trouble Man, stays in some trouble man 
 Bank rolls, rubber band, you can call me Trouble Man
