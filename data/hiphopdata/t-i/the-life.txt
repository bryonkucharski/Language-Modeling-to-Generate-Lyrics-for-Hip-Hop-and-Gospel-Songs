T.I. 
 I bet you niggas thinking that I living it up 
 Till you see polices laughing as they picking me up 
 Went from seeing how many bitches I can fit in the truck 
 To 3 hots and a cot is you kidding or what fuck how 
 Many millions I got nigga so what if I'm hot when I got prices on my head 
 Feds rushing my spot a million 
 Haters wont me dead force to carry me gat 
 But you a seven time felon what you doing with that 
 It's a catch 
 22 either you lose or lose 
 That's the way the game structured for real niggas to suffer 
 And I ain't never 
 Been a busta alway stood on my feet 
 Like a man prepared to take what ever coming for me 
 A pussy nigga 
 Or polices wit a warrant for me 
 I'm a "G" prepared to die for what's important to me 
 Look anybody in the 
 Eye who say they want it wit me 
 Put up the house and bet the odds if coming from me 
 OG's say I need to 
 Learn and be patient 
 You telling me wit these seven years of probation 
 Pistol charges and a host of 
 Other open cases 
 If niggas only knew the kind of time I was facing 
 I tried to keep to myself but 
 Sometime I couldn't take it 
 Got 4 kids wit smiles on they faces 
 Mean more to me than my crown and my bracelet 
 Take that away from me and my life is butt naked 
 I could tell ya 'bout the life of a real nigga 
 I could tell ya 'bout the life that I live nigga 
 What you know 'bout the life of a real nigga? 
 What you know bout this life that I live nigga? 
 Hey I could tell you 'bout the life of a real nigga 
 I could tell ya 'bout the life that I live nigga 
 What you know 'bout the life of a real nigga? 
 What you know bout this life that I live nigga? 
 Brisco: 
 I deal with stone cold killers, drug dealers, and extortionists 
 Ex-Convicts, Five percent is in this lawyer bitch 
 See, I was brought through the rugged terrain 
 I'm two-faced a 'cause a jack boy showed me the game 
 It's four four that's a pretty ass key 
 That's the sound, we call that there a free throw 
 Pop you know the numbers equivalent to last week 
 Buyin whole sale, break it down and put it on the street 
 My big brother shake ice all night 
 A sore loser when we do, he be ready to fight 
 I could tell ya 'bout the life of a real nigga 
 He keep it happenin', when hatas come, he deal wid em 
 That's all it take?ain't that a bitch 
 She broke down wid dem troopers found all them bricks 
 And through all this shit 
 One thing I could never understand (what?) 
 ?A snitch
