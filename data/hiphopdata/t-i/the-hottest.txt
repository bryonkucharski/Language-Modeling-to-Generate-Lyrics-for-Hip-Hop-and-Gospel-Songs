(Intro: T.I.) 
 Yo, ay, huh-ay 
 I gotta love my man here engineerin (okay) 
 It don't take me too long to write it (uh, huh-ay) 
 How long it take you to record me baby? HEY! (huh-ay) 
 Hey ya ain't live, you don't ride, you don't do it like I do it 
 (It's all good man, we gon' ride on these fuck niggaz anyway though) 
 Ya ain't real, you don't wanna get into it 
 Don't play with yourself nigga (okay) 
 Play a lotto nigga (okay) 
 Hey - let's get it! (Yeah fuck nigga, AY!) 
 (Chorus: T.I.) 
 Hey ya ain't live, you don't ride, you don't do it like I do it 
 I keep it real - ya ain't real, you don't wanna get into it 
 Ya ain't crunk, ya ain't buck, ya ain't hard, ya ain't G 
 You ain't got what I got pumpin in your heart, you ain't me 
 You do all that yellin', holla, ya ain't real and ya ain't 'bout it 
 Ya ain't serious, ya ain't crazy, you know you don't wanna die 
 Ya ain't hustle from the bottom, you don't got it like I got it 
 You can hate and you can lie but pussy nigga I'm the hottest. 
 (T.I.) 
 I'm the realer nigga in this shit, aside from all the business shit 
 I'm the nigga sucka niggas best to keep it pimpin' with 
 People say I start a lot of shit, I say I finish it 
 Thank God it wasn't no witnesses, I'd still be servin' sentences 
 Rap shit way more stressful that I love my other businesses 
 Thank God I'm a professional and scared I don't begin to get 
 Whether in a Phantom or the truck with all the kids in it 
 Still tote a hammer try me, man I hope you listenin 
 Your death gon' be elaborate, real fuckin' extravagant 
 I'm down to die myself to show you niggas I ain't havin' it 
 Had to kill your son and a few your mama had to get 
 And they were playin' dumb, we run in and ask where daddy at. 
 (Chorus w/ ad libs) 
 (Mac Boney) 
 I carry niggas on my back like a bookbag 
 Put the pistol in his hand and tell him shoot his ass 
 I pull a little file faster than them credit people 
 Yo' ass dead, that's why you probably seein dead people 
 The weapon with me's really lethal, yeah it scare people (oh my God) 
 I know off top that I'm gon' bust, that's why I dare people 
 And I won't dare cheat you, I fair-and-square beat you 
 Same time, same time's why I'm on that Grey Goose 
 Don't make me spray and let loose, 'cause I won't hesitate to 
 I heard one shot then heard two, jumped up out the truck like what it do 
 I got a fo'-5 on me and got a nine too 
 A nigga sayin' "Mac Boney, we ain't shoot at you" 
 I say you sucker ass niggas better keep it movin 
 'Fore y'all boys be the ones I end up doin' 
 (Chorus w/ ad libs)
