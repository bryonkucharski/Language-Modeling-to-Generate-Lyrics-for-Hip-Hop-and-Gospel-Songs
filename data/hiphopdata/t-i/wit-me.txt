Bitch! Put my dick on yo face, put my gun in yo purse 
 Put my work in yo pussy, bitch don't come on a word 
 Pass the weed to your slime, these niggas greener than lime 
 So many knots in my pockets, the bitch need a massage 
 I was born in the drought, I hope I die in yo mouth 
 If you're a rat you should've died as a mouse 
 The weed louder than the opera house, till the fat lady sings 
 Drop codeine in my punch, I'm 'bout to take a swing 
 If niggas thinkin' I'm soft, I'll knock yo thinkin' cap off 
 I get blood out these pussies, I'm a sneaking tampon 
 This for my niggas back home, I'm still New Orleans regardless 
 Got bitches fallin' like olives, can sell that bullshit to a tourist 
 My bitch is badder than me, call that Adam and Eve 
 I do tricks on my skateboard, not up my sleeve 
 I kiss yo bitch on the neck, shoot your man in the head 
 Hit his mama address then send his parents a text 
 I play with pussy, not these niggas 
 Crucify these niggas 
 Kidnap 'em 'cause they fowl so ask 'em who gon' buy these niggas 
 Got Lil Wayne on her ass, Lil Tunechi on her titties 
 To kill me you gotta die wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me 
 (Wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)

 Or sucka neither, go ahead play ya part wit it 
 Cash on deck, they be layin' round wit it 
 Gotta cake up, where the suckas playin' rounds wit it 
 I'm cold, doubling this, just ask yo bitch 
 I swear she know her legs up high 
 She spread eagle and then took in my big ego 
 I'm stealthy, ask Tunechi and them 
 Let me tell you a little something 'bout me 
 I talk shit, break like Muhammad Ali 
 Damn, whoop a nigga ass like Muhammad Ali 
 I'm thrown, no catchin' me 
 These niggas in the game - so sad to me 
 I'm sure no one would care we 
 Just put them out their misery 
 But no sympathy and no green, uh uh 
 Me home with no heat, uh uh 
 Can nigga talk bullshit of records at CM in public 
 And they never do nothing 
 You violator, demonstrations I'ma 
 Put niggas up on there, wherever we want 
 I got racks in my pocket right next to my lamas 
 I'm mowin' my bag, the purple mohana 
 Get after my girl and it's round whatever 
 So don't be struck down when you seein' me nigga 
 Whoever fuck with me be smoking the Sadie 
 You ready for war, you 'bout that like really 
 You catch me in Cali, you catch me in Phily 
 See me in Miami, the coppers is wit me 
 Don't kick no niggas who be gossippin' with me 
 Lookin' for yo bitch but she probably (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me) 
 We ain't playin', got 100 racks (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)

 Uh, pussy money weed with me 
 Before you judge me I plead guilty 
 I wish a nigga would, I won't get a splinter 
 Just bought a chicken, 'bout to break it down into chicken tenders 
 This block booming, I'm not human 
 My drop zoomin', my eyes groomin' 
 One giant leap for mankind 
 I'm high as moon men, how have you been? 
 Burning on my waist 
 But it ain't that far away 
 I'm sparkling like some Chardonnay 
 Here today, gone today 
 I play with pussy, not these niggas 
 Crucify these niggas 
 Kidnap 'em 'cause they fowl so ask 'em who gon' buy these niggas 
 Got Lil Wayne on her ass, Lil Tunechi on her titties 
 To kill me you gotta die wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me 
 Hey Wayne wait man, these niggas ain't true 
 Julio on the yard, these niggas can't do 
 These niggas ain't King, these niggas ain't Tune 
 Got the game locked up, covered every angle 
 Got the outside, inside, middle lane too 
 All sold up nigga, hold up nigga 
 Pimps on the loop, put yo hoes up nigga 
 Handcuff that bitch when we roll up nigga 
 We'll hit that bitch come pull up 
 Hair head and shoulders up cover hole up in here 
 When you're late checkin' up, she match us about 
 Then we rollin' some loud and leave up out the house 
 We leave up the house, counting 100's and 50's 
 And go do a show for 250 
 We sell out arenas at hundreds of cities 
 These niggas want trouble? I'm bringing it with me 
 We ain't playin', got 100 racks (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)
