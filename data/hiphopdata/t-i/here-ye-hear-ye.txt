(Sk8brd) 
 There's a rainbow everywhere, depending on where you stand 
 Whether the dashboard, a yay, or the walls, a hundred grand each 
 Double R interior tan, outside is peach 
 Oh you tryna make a deal out in Golden Beach 
 Or the Florida Keys ducking the Florida D's 
 But you only end up with bricks and sand 
 I know niggas that run from their shadows like Peter Pan 
 Running like it's a Nike commercial but he's the man 
 What they don't like on site he murk like he's the clan 
 8 balls the size of baseballs like Jeter's hand 
 It fecal fam', yeah it's the shit 
 Zip ya face up when skateboard is on the script 
 Catch me in the Gap V with some BBC trunks 
 Flip flops sipping on cream like it's punch 
 I push the spaceship with the chrome lady in the front 
 Bending over like she just puffed Busta's blunt 
 I told y'all muthafuckas once, I think I'm hungry 
 Finna eat y'all niggas lunch 
 Y'all niggas cunts, I'm from the commonwealth 
 Where wealth ain't common 
 When niggas roll around with chrome solvers looking for problems 
 Mouth full of gold, flame when they roll 
 Arthritic fingers, niggas bang when they stroll 
 Trading in the hats for the cane and the gold 
 The golds for the chain and the cane was on swole 
 Ayo T.I.P. get these Peon niggas told 
 (T.I.) 
 Still stand tall when it all falls down 
 Whether Hollywood hills or a one horse town 
 You should know better, there's no better than these four letters 
 More than ever niggas want me dead 
 'Cause they starving and I'm getting fed 
 But fuck 'em anyway 
 I'd rather be me on my worst day than to be a sucka nigga on his birthday 
 All cake, no candles, just a living example 
 Ten toes down, all out, no sandals 
 Godfather, a young Marlon Brando 
 Let me make sure they understand, yo 
 Here ye, here ye, you wise, you fear me 
 Real niggas on they shine, much obliged, mercy! 
 Everybody wanna criticize him 'bout how bad he ended up 
 Look how bad he coulda been 
 I coulda caught a body sold a brick to somebody 
 Who volunteered my information to the federals? 
 I made it outta all of that 
 Like I ain't gon' be proud of that 
 So petty shit, you sticking to me, gimme all you got of that 
 Doing this for all my niggas 
 Who 'bout to go to prison and let a nigga kill 'em 
 So we leaving this PO snub nose in his denim 
 Trap or death is waiting 'round the corners that he been in 
 On bended knee, God forgive us, we've been sinning 
 In our defense, look at the options we've been given 
 Laying in the prison cell staring at the ceiling 
 Back in this bitch again, I guess they weren't bullshittin' huh 
 Still wonder where it all went wrong 
 Since Phil got killed, I ain't never moved on 
 Like I'm still in the club where the blows got thrown 
 When my crown fell down and I got dethroned 
 Bunch of niggas around but I feel all alone 
 Like a piece of me is missin', guess it never came home 
 Probably died in a van when it all hit the fan 
 Save the life of a friend, we don't all get the chance 
 Now here I stand with blood on my hands trying hard to explain so hi mom, understand 
 I done fought for the loss for the soul of a man 
 Only soldiers know how that'll take a toll on a man 
 Burdens on the world of my shoulders: heavy 
 Visibly composed, my emotions buried 
 Scary, so if I pop a pill, smoke a blunt, or take a shot 
 Y'all let a niggga live 
 Still baffled how my life unraveled 
 In the meantime time just traveled 
 Can't see behind the walls of my castle 
 Opinionated Peons son but who asked you 
 I tell you what you do 
 Take ya two cents 
 Kick rocks to a fountain, pitching to make a wish 
 Shit, if wishes had wings, they'd all make it to heaven 
 And we'd all be kings 
 If wishes had wings, they'd all make it to heaven 
 And we'd all be kings 
 Yeah
