 Yeah, ay ay, 
 Why don't you let me welcome the niggas to the World they ain't welcome to 
 You understand? 
 It bring me great pleasure to welcome the real and banish the fake 
 No big mouth that hold cake, fag bait ass niggas allowed 
 But to everybody else 
 I would like to welcome you 
 To the World of (to the world of) 
 Fast money, fast cars, big diamond rings 
 Chief chains and the girls of 
 Fake smiles, broken hearts and if you looking 
 For your real love 
 You wont find it here 
 If you looking for your real love 
 Well goodnight my dear

 Ooh, if you looking for love 
 Don't come around here 
 Ooh, if you looking for love 
 It ain't here my dear 
 Mmmmm mmmmmh

 (T.I.) 
 It's my pleasure to welcome you to the World of 
 Fast money, flashy cars, big guns 
 Undone, threw away for the love of 
 The game, I don't need a chain or the fame, still shine 
 Spend time with the girls of 
 Fake smiles, broken hearts trying hard in the club looking for 
 Her real love 
 You won't find it here 
 All I got is hard dick and conversation for you 
 I was just high, even lying when I say I love you 
 My mind saying it were both 
 I just wanna fuck you, her too 
 Blowing lile smelling like a bubba kush perform 
 She coming home with me, she finna meet her doom 
 She ain't saying I'm the greatest finna change her tune 
 The coldest and the hottest call me December June 
 Deliver euphoria straight to your room 
 I hit that ass, and I wait, I zoom 
 Make it rain nonstop call me young typhoon 
 Top spot already filled up no room 
 Throw down for some paper and your purse so soon 
 Well wrong she is and mistaken she was 
 Tip broke, never heard such thing of 
 I'll fuck you up, don't touch me 'cause 
 Just trust me bruh, It must be 
 Li-li-li-living my dreams 
 Don't wake me up 
 Yo-yo-you fake it till you make it, must suck 
 All th-th-the haters hate us for the flav of the paper 
 That's why I can't love my neighbours 
 Dangerous, don't kick, cut you 
 If you ain't welcome in my world bitch fuck you 
 Dangerous, don't kick, cut you 
 If you ain't welcome in my world bitch fuck you

 Backseat driving screaming on a nigga like I'm actually driving
