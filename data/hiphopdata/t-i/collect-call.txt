On top of the world and I'm standin tall 
 But if I ever ever have to take a fall 
 Will you accept my collect call 
 Will you accept my collect call 
 'Cause everybody loves you when you ballin 
 But don't nobody want you when you fallin' 
 I gotta know will you accept my collect call 
 I gotta know will you accept my collect call 
 (T.I.) 
 I was told way back in the days when I was trappin 
 Never mind what niggas say judge 'em all on their actions 
 It's hard to imagik in the day when I was trappin 
 Never mind what nine when you traveling 
 Havin' fun gettin' paper catch a case and see how niggas act then 
 Out a cell partner been fired he rattin on me 
 Got a little benja pension now they turn they back on me 
 Shit 'cause out of sight is out of mind 
 Better put your trust in God homie man will let you down every time 
 And I'm speaking experience, serious 
 Imagine my surprise hearin from the inside 
 Everybody talkin' 'bout me like the nigga just died 
 TIP gone, 20 years at the least get 5 
 Man niggas just lie for suspicion of they snitchin 
 Not to mention the rumors of me committin suicide 
 God will open your eyes and show you who really with ya 
 But keep it in the back of your mind when it's over how niggas did ya 
 (T.I.) 
 I ain't never asked a nigga to do shit for me 
 I wouldn't do in return but guess you live and you learn 
 Don't expect my well bein to be a nigga concern 
 'Cause I know that ain't the way the world turn 
 'Cause everybody love to see a nigga assed out 
 Rather see you lose it all than to see you cash out 
 They gossip like bitches I don't even ask how 
 'Cause niggas ain't shit! I believe that now 
 And it don't even matter how much you do for people they'll love to 
 See you beat down livin' in the gutta, what a 
 Shame at the least in the game when you see 
 They want you locked up more than the police 
 The same can't wait to get a nigga off the street 
 They hate to see me sittin' on buckets off C 
 Dog beat bet to you don't even make sense 
 But that mentality is exactly why you'll never be rich, HATER! 
 (T.I.) 
 I remain a stand up guy no matter what I 
 Stood tall chest out head up high 
 With my back against the wall layin it all on the line 
 With God on my side I perform every time 
 Must I remind you 
 Similar to a miracle just short of amazin 
 Survived shit that would've drove most niggas crazy 
 Rose to the occasion whatever situation 
 Surprised haters and came out gun a blazin' 
 Theoretically speakin' but you rather be thinkin' 
 I'll fold 'cause you want a view of me I know 
 All I got is the family, friends come and go 
 And with that understandin I put none before 
 My folk you know enough to do the same I hope 
 If not, shit ya ass will find out 
 When you on top everybody wanna ball with ya 
 But when you not you wouldn't even know who to call would ya?
