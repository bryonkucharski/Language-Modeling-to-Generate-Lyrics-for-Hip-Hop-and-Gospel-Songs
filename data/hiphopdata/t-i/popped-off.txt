We back at it, the wait is over 
 Dr. Dre, T.I.P., 
 This shit is special 
 See a party ain't a party till the doc walk in it 
 It's hard to get it started till I hopped off in it 
 Then it got so crunk one minute 
 Since you didn't get to witness, just listen 
 I came in hot, and then I saw 
 As soon as I arrived then the shit popped off 
 The shit popped off 
 It's officially a gangsta party 
 You can leave, if she came to party 
 Then the shit popped off (popped off) 
 Shit popped off (popped off) 
 Niggas hands in the air, bitches takin' tops off 
 Put the chronic in the air, and the shit popped off 
 It's been awhile since you've heard these beats 
 You're malnourished 
 But he's back now, to flood these streets 
 They shall flourish 
 Others try but they lack courage 
 In fact, this track was on the back burner at least 
 So back to the lab I had to go 
 But it was too magical, so 
 Here, doctor smack a ho's back, ask if it's tactical, (sure is) 
 Girl, I hope your vaginal has indoors 
 'Cause I'm about to do somethin' tragical 
 Rest assure this 
 'Cause homie hit the OE flow, you know me from before 
 But you don't know me like this, so do see do 
 Get on top of me and ride it like a rodeo, ho 
 I'll have you OD'ing on dick, this belong to your soul 
 For loneliness, I'll kill your loneliness 
 But only just for, one night 
 Yeah that was fun, right? But I gotta go 
 I got a bottle of Mo and fo' mo' lil' mommy's 
 Lookin' like models, waitin' at the do' inside of my ho-tel 
 All ready to swallow and yo, follow the flow and traffic to the top flo' 
 And you gonna smell a lot of Merlot, a lot of chronic for sho' 
 Gin and tonic sold from the top to the bottom, let's go 
 Order some more bottles, come on momma 
 Would you like a drink on me? 
 To me it's no problem if you wanna, baby come and drink with me 
 She take it off at the do', she take it off for the do' 
 Get that ass on the flo', go, go 
 To me, there's no problem if you wanna, baby come drink with me 
 Bright lights, late nights 
 Drop auto-mobiles outside hotels with a lot of hoes 
 Bottles poured, blow a lot of dro, no powder though 
 Everywhere you tryin' to go, I been a long time ago 
 Swag done surpassed, my style is so spazz, I pop tags daily 
 Drop Phantom, four eighty 
 Walk up in the place, and all the ladies go crazy 
 Want to get impregnated but all they need is throat babies 
 They runnin' up and askin' 
 "Is it true you know Shady 
 Dr. Dre be hangin' out with you, for real? " Ho chill 
 Like a magnet attracted to a nigga gettin' money 
 I tell 'em, "Kneel down, suck a nigga dick or somethin'" 
 Rubberband poppin' off the bank roll 
 Hoppin' out the champagne Rolls, with the automatic do's 
 Pockets on swoll, both wrists so froze 
 King of the South, balls out on the West Coast 
 Let's toast 
 Order some more bottles, come on momma 
 Would you like a drink on me? 
 To me it's no problem if you, baby come and drink with me 
 She take it off at the do', she take it off for the do' 
 Get that ass on the flo', go, go 
 To me, there's no problem if you wanna, baby come drink with me 
 You can have the time of your life, it's all right 
 Make it a night to remember (remember), how couldn't you remember? (remember) 
 You can have the time of your life, it's all right 
 Make it a night to remember (remember), how couldn't you remember? (remember) 
 Yes, yes 
 Think about it 
 Who brought the gangsta shit to the party 
 Aftermath, better than ever
