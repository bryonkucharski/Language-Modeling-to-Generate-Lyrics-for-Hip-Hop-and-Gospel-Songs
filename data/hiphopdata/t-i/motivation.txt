 Nigga, get on ya job, tell 'em, "Haters get on ya job, nigga" (Motivation) 
 Haters better get on ya job, tell 'em, "Haters get on ya job, nigga" (It's motivation) 
 Sucka nigga, get on ya job, if ya hatin,' get on ya job, nigga 
 You can look me in my eyes, see I'm ready for whatever 
 Anythang don't kill me make me better 
 I ain't dead, nigga, you can take the fame and the cheddar 
 Any game, any deal, I'm still a go-getter 
 Take my freedom for the moment but it ain't forever 
 I got the spirit of a god, heart of a dope dealer 
 I'm a king, seen hangin' with some cold killas 
 I ain't never back down or ran from no nigga 
 I ain't sat down yet, pimp, standin' gorilla 
 Even if I'm all alone or standin' four niggas 
 Tell 'em jump, pimpin' it don't get no realer 
 5'9" with the soul of a 6'4" nigga 
 I separated the fakes paralyzed from the waist down 
 From the real stand-up guys of the A-Town 
 Can't even look me in my eyes, put ya face down 
 I'm outta jail, nigga, what you gotta say now?

 Me locked in a box, niggas happy to see 
 Put anybody on top, any rapper but T.I.P. 
 But back to reality G, ...O.D. still carryin' me, nigga I run this 
 Spread ya rumors, kick all ya li'l dumb shit 
 Tell lies, laugh 'bout the time that I'm gon' get 
 If it make you feel better, picture me over and done with 
 Punk bitch, come with all the gossip you can come with 
 Small thang to a giant, I can overcome this 
 Jail, out and done this, rap I'm just havin' fun with 
 I could be a local joker, never have one hit 
 Nigga, New Finish alone'll get me dumb rich 
 Why these rappers sellin' records, gettin' pennies? 
 If Grand Hustle sell any, I'ma get plenty 
 If God with me, who could be against me, sucka? 
 Can't make me suffer, just make me tougher
