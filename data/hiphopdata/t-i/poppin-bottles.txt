(Chorus - T.I.) 
 My section in the club, Remy, Rose 
 When you're all ready say go, okay 
 Everybody pop a bottle, make that thing go pop 
 Everybody pop a bottle, make that thing go pop 
 You see him standing on the furniture doing his thing 
 Tell the club owner, fuck yo' crouch, Rick James nigga 
 Pop a bottle, make that thing go blow 
 Let her drink it till she drown 
 Let a girl go wild, pop a bottle 
 Bow, bow, bow... 
 (T.I.) 
 Bring the 1738 Champagne the boss 
 Watch ya gettin' money make it rain buy a bottle 
 Pop a cork, dork 
 If I may retort 
 I ball just as hard tomorrow as the day before 
 I pop bottles but I don't pour 
 Save the glass for guys, we ballin' on a budget 
 Fuck it, let your glasses rise 
 I'm straight to the head with mine, why you acting surprised 
 Ask any hoe who know me, all I do is smash and ride 
 Buckets of bubbly, shake it up and let it splash in the eyes 
 No subtraction, only cash to divide 
 We gettin' money, bank roll, supersized 
 Whether rain, sleet, sunny 
 Let the good times roll and the bottles keep coming 
 (Drake) 
 Yeah, okay, bring that shit to poppa 
 I heard you talk bout other niggas 
 Them other nigga no matter 
 The tag team back bitch, boom shakalaka 
 Me and Weezy run this bitch so bring me one soda and vodka 
 And a fuji for my nigga cause the police probably watching 
 Man, probation is a bitch but going back is not an option 
 We be sunning all these niggas, put there ass up for adoption 
 And we start with straight shots, that get the bottle poppin' 
 We be working all night, telethon shit 
 Roll a super skinny once you you Ne Lemon shit 
 Ooh, that's that fire, that have you calm shit 
 You with a lot of dudes, that's that Elton John shit 
 Ah, to each his own, I like a fruit that's grown 
 I like a bad bitch from a decent home 
 Me and Tip, that's that pimpin' that we preachin' on 
 And everybody tryna listen nigga, speakerphone 
 (T.I.) 
 I know the sucker wish the judge threw the book at me 
 'Cause I show up to the club, super cool, look at me 
 Everything brand new, you get money like who? 
 Spent 150 on my car and my Audemar too 
 When I walk up in the spot, ain't nobody saw you 
 They see me like "there he go" 
 Look at you like "ah who?" 
 Bought every bottle at the bar 
 Shortie you know how I do 
 I take 'em all across your, I ain't finna argue 
 Still big shit poppin', nothing changed but my clothes 
 Triple digits in my pocket, rubber band bank roll 
 Tell the bitch I take you places where your man can't go 
 Can't be, he ain't doing shit, if he ain't me 
 Can't you see the difference between us when I walkin' to the door 
 Your twenty thousand worth of ones, start letting money go 
 Let it fly, throw some twenty when my one running low 
 Fifty stack, I'mma show you how to ball, triple that
