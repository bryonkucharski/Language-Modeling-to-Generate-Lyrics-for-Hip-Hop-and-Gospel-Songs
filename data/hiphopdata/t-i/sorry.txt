My cup runneth over with Pinot Grigio, hold up 
 You bogus in the lambo if you ain't lifting the door up 
 You bogus poppin' pills if you ain't pickin' the ho up 
 You bogus running out on your kids my nigga grow up 
 For God's sake, like a wedding, cutting large cake 
 For large stakes let the hammer bang broad day 
 Ay, nevermind what the blogs say 
 This what my mind and my heart say 
 My philosophy profit off of my properties 
 Get it, flip it, we got to be rich, that broke shit is obsolete 
 Possibly off of my rocker, watch how you watching me 
 Sophisticated, psychotic, fly as a pilot 
 Officially silent, all you wish you could get I got it 
 Unlimited titanium nigga, what's in yo wallet? 
 Out of gladiator college, I made it summa cum laude 
 While you clowns couldn't have got a cap and gown if you bought it 
 I parlay with Saudis, buying crude oil and diamonds 
 Hustle January, July, fly to Dubai 
 A broke nigga telling me 'bout how I'm dividing the pies 
 Like a blind nigga telling me it's an eye for an eye 
 Bullheaded and stubborn I be that way until I die 
 But find a nigga with more hustle than me I dare you to try 
 And according to the hand on my Audemar 
 It's my time to shine so fuck y'all 
 What should I be sorry for 
 Who should I be sorry to 
 What should I be sorry for 
 Who should I be sorry to 
 The fact is you can't please everybody 
 You can't please everybody 
 What should I be sorry for 
 Who should I be sorry to 
 I grew up in the gutter, life a motherfucker 
 I get that why I don't trust a motherfucker 
 Seen a nigga snitch on they mom, shoot at they brother 
 Go to prison in love with a bitch and a nigga fuck her 
 I seen real G's destroyed by real suckers 
 Innocent ladies raped and defenseless babies abducted 
 Such a horrible truth, but you see it over and over 
 It's nothing, you numb to it and your heart grow colder 
 Pacify your pain with a chain and a Rover 
 Fuck it, justify your action by stacking your dough up 
 You show up with a brick of cocaine and baking soda 
 Just enough for me to blow up, nigga hold up 
 Switch the flow up, cause these niggas be snitchin' so much 
 I promise all they missing's the badge, coffee, and donut 
 Go to jail so what, never see my integrity perish 
 That ain't the Harris' way, study my pedigree 
 Promise I'm one of the only ones who keep it 100 
 Probably why I think they all out to get me, you can't convince me 
 Large money and fame will plant seeds of envy 
 To make my partners resent me enough to come and get me 
 Catch me slippin' and hit me, just like they did 50 
 'Cause I'm in the position that he think he should be given 
 Listen, dawg, the fact of the matter is 
 I'm on a narrow path and we all can't travel 
 What should I be sorry for 
 Who should I be sorry to 
 What should I be sorry for 
 Who should I be sorry to 
 The fact is you can't please everybody 
 You can't please everybody 
 What should I be sorry for 
 Who should I be sorry to 
 What it ain't, what it is? 
 Even if you gotta live 
 I learned that apartment is way more exciting than a big ass house on a hill 
 I used to be a way better writer and a rapper 
 When I used to want a black Karmann Ghia 
 Now a nigga speeding in a Porsche 
 Feeling like I'm going off a course 
 Cut these fuck niggas off 
 Nigga Tip in my life, scream that till I'm hoarse 
 Duck these get the fuck off me projectiles, 
 Bitch you ain't really got a choice 
 I'm living my life live yours 
 I don't even like rapping fast, but that's how the word come to me 
 Talk to me sideways nigga that's your ass 
 Slow it down, this that shit that'll make you call your momma 
 Say hey I'm sorry for begging for all them clothes you couldn't afford 
 And this the type of shit that'll make you call your rap partner 
 And say I'm sorry I'm awkward, my fault for fuckin' up the tours 
 I hated all the attention so I ran from it 
 Fuck it if we did, but I hope we ain't lose no fans from it 
 I'm a grown-ass kid, you know ain't never cared about no damn money 
 Why do we try so hard to be stars, just to dodge comments 
 And this that shit that'll make you call your baby mama 
 When you gone on half a pill, don't know why but that I did 
 Then you take a flight back to the crib, y'all make love like college kids 
 And you say all the shit you gon' do better, we can try this shit again 
 'Round the time the dope wear off, you feel stupid, she feel lost 
 That's that dope, I mean, I mean dopamine you think Cupid done worn off 
 Waiting in the hallway with her arms crossed 
 Her baby boy face full of applesauce 
 Maybe should have stayed but it ain't yo fault 
 Too much pressure, I fell off, I'm sorry 
 Was young and had to choose between you 
 And what the rest of the world might offer me, shit what would you do 
 Well I'd probably do it differently if second the chance 
 Only if some cool ass older man would've let me know in advance 
 This, this quarry, that is dug so deep in a father's chest 
 When he feel that he's broken up his nest 
 And he figured shit he was just doing the best that he could 
 Which end up being the worst that he could 
 And all some pussy nigga on the internet can say is that verse ain't good 
 It's boring - boring? 
 Really? 
 When I'm disgusted with this world and I can hardly breathe and 
 Told so many lies, don't know what to believe 
 I discussed it with this girl, and this is what she said 
 She said lay down baby, baby, rest your weary head up 
 I love these distractions but my mind don't wanna rest 
 But my body disagree so I laid up on her breasts, yes 
 Ooh, you are so fucking fine 
 I woke up the next morning with new purpose on my mind 
 Ooh, who pulls your ponytail 
 Who knows your body well 
 What should I be sorry for? 
 Who should I be sorry to?
