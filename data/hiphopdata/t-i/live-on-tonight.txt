I'm on the road the day I die 
 That unchangeable surprise 
 No waking up but don't you cry 
 Let your dreams live on tonight 
 Uuuuh Uuuuh 
 Uuuuh Uuuuh 
 Uuuuh Uuuuh 
 Live on tonight 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Hustle Gang nigga! 
 Aye 
 Leggo! 
 We do it big, going hard, get it in 
 I tell make my hustle full fittin in 
 I'll catch a fair cake, go to prison then 
 Turn around, do the same shit again 
 Down back, countin' rack 
 A hundred kilo champagne, hey I drown that 
 Loud pack, burnt up 
 Do the iMAX bid, shorty turnt up 
 The American dream, I'm livin' in it 
 To Trayvon get some Jesses, I kill a bitch every minute 
 Yeah talk, give a damn about the sentence 
 You ain't down to die for something 
 Your life ain't worth living 
 I'm on the road the day I die 
 That unchangeable surprise 
 No waking up but don't you cry 
 Let your dreams live on tonight 
 Uuuuh Uuuuh 
 Uuuuh Uuuuh 
 Uuuuh Uuuuh 
 Live on tonight 
 Yeah 
 That right 
 Family Hustle nigga 
 I'm livin' so my sons and daughters never see martyr 
 Get it, spend it today, save something tomorrow 
 A young king's Arthur, learned from my father 
 Tomorrow 50-50, today is our hour 
 Damn right, 24 hours, 365 
 Push it to the limit, switchin lanes on the highway 
 Like fuck it, if I diw today I die in pain 
 I'm straight nigga, straight bullets in your driveway 
 Man the game, man the game, why should I play? 
 For my fam, my life, damn alley 
 Put it on the line, never mind the consequences 
 You ain't down to die for something your life ain't worth living 
 I'm on the road the day I die 
 That unchangeable surprise 
 No waking up but don't you cry 
 Let your dreams live on tonight 
 Uuuuh Uuuuh 
 Uuuuh Uuuuh 
 Uuuuh Uuuuh 
 Live on tonight 
 Ahuh 
 I ain't finish, leggo 
 You know a trouble man ride with a hundred band 
 Bet it all, win or lose, it ain't nothing man 
 Modern day, near perfect, I'm the son of man 
 Every summer kill shit, call me Son of Sam 
 Big chain, big car 
 I could buy a big house on my black card 
 Them other suckers only wanna act hard 
 Hustle Gang, we jump off, flow stunt hard 
 So respected, I don't even need a bodyguard 
 But if it fully automatic then it probably hours 
 Real talk, give a fuck about the sentence 
 If you ain't down to die for something your life ain't worth living 
 I'm on the road the day I die 
 That unchangeable surprise 
 No waking up but don't you cry 
 Let your dreams live on tonight 
 Uuuuh Uuuuh 
 Uuuuh Uuuuh 
 Uuuuh Uuuuh 
 Live on tonight
