 Rihanna: 
 You're gonna be a shining star, 
 With fancy clothes, fancy car-ars. 
 And then you'll see, 
 You're gonna go far. 
 Cause everyone knows, 
 Who you are-are. 
 So live your life, ay ay ay. 
 Instead of chasing that paper. 
 Just live your life (Oh!), 
 Ay ay ay. 
 You got no time for no haters. 
 Just live your life (Oh!), 
 Ay ay ay. 
 No telling where it'll take you. 
 Just live your life (Oh!), 
 Ay ay ay. 
 'Cause I'm a paper chaser. 
 Just living my life. 
 T.I.: 
 I'm the opposite of moderate, 
 Immaculately polished 
 With the spirit of a hustler 
 And the swagger of a college kid. 
 Allergic to the counterfeit, 
 Impartial to the politics. 
 Articulate 
 But still would grab a nigga 
 By the collar quick. 
 Whoever had problems, 
 They reckonsile 
 They just holla till. 
 If that don't work 
 And just fails, 
 Then turn around and follow till. 
 I got love for the game 
 But ay 
 I'm not in love with all of it. 
 I do without the fame 
 And the rappers nowadays are comedy. 
 The hootin' and the hollerin', 
 Back and forth with the argueing. 
 Where you from, who you know, 
 What you make 
 And what kind of car you in. 
 Seems as though you lost sight 
 Of what's important 
 With the positive. 
 And checks 
 Until your bank account, 
 And you're about poverted. 
 Your values is a disarrayed, 
 Prioritized are horribly. 
 Unhappy with the riches 
 Cause you pis-pone morraly. 
 Ignoring all prior advice 
 And fore warning. 
 And we might be 
 Full of ourselves 
 All of a sudden aren't we? 
 Rihanna: 
 You're gonna be a shining star, 
 With fancy clothes, fancy car-ars. 
 And then you'll see, 
 You're gonna go far. 
 Cause everyone knows, 
 Who you are-are. 
 So live your life, ay ay ay. 
 Instead of chasing that paper. 
 Just live your life (Oh!), 
 Ay ay ay. 
 You got no time for no haters. 
 Just live your life (Oh!), 
 Ay ay ay. 
 No telling where it'll take you. 
 Just live your life (Oh!), 
 Ay ay ay. 
 'Cause I'm a paper chaser. 
 Just living my life. 
 (Rihanna) 
 Now everybody watchin what I do 
 Come walk in my shoes 
 And see the way that I'm livin' if you really want to 
 I got my mind on my money and I'm not goin' nowhere 
 So keep on gettin' yo paper (ah ah) 
 And keep on climbin 
 Look in the mirror 
 And keep on shinin 
 Till the game end 
 Till the clock stop 
 We gon' post up on the top spot 
 Livin' the life, the life 
 In the brand new city 
 Got my whole team with me 
 Livin' my life, my life 
 I do it how I wanna do 
 I'm livin' my life, my life 
 I will never loose 'em 
 Livin' my life, my life 
 And I'm not stoppin' 
 So live your life.
