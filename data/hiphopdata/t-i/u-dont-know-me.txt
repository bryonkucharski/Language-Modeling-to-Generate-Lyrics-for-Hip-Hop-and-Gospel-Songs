You might see me in the street 
 But nigga you don't know me 
 When ya holla on the street 
 Rememba you don't know me 
 Save all the hatin' and the poppin' 
 Nigga you don't know me 
 Quit tellin' niggas you my partna 
 Nigga you don't know me 
 Don't be a groupie keep it movin 
 Nigga you don't know me 
 Hey I ain't trippin' pimp the truth is 
 Really you don't know me 
 Ya you know they call me T.I. 
 But you don't know me 
 You be hatin' and I see why 
 'Cause you don't know me 
 I think its time I made a song fo niggas who don't know me 
 I graduated out the streets, Ima real OG 
 I been trappin shootin pistols since I stood 4 feet 
 So all you niggas actin' bad, you gon have to show me 
 You gone make me bring da chevy to a real slow creep 
 My niggas hangin' out the window, mouth fulla gold teeth 
 When the guns start poppin', wonder when it's gonna cease 
 Choppa hitchu on the side and create a slow leak 
 We can end the speculation 'cause today we gone see 
 What's the future of a pussy nigga hatin' on me 
 I giva fuck about the feds investigation on me 
 I don't care they at my shows and they waitin on me 
 Ima keep a flossin poppin' long as Toomp is on the beat 
 Tell police that I ain't stoppin' Ima keep it in the streets 
 Contrary to yo believes, I'm as real as you can be 
 Fuck yo thoughts and yo feelings nigga you don't know me. 
 Hey once again let me remind you nigga you don't know me 
 So don't be walkin' up and askin what's the deal on a key. 
 I don't know if you wearin wires you could be the police 
 If I was slangin dope you couldn't get an OZ 
 See me at the PSC follow through and tha show deep 
 Police holdin' up the door, 'cause they know we tote heat 
 I just wanna wrap a C, blowin' dro ina fleet 
 Only hittin 'bout a dozen different bitches ina week

 Ballin out @ anytime, hit every store and spend a G 
 Wanna ball in the Bahamas curtousy of KT
