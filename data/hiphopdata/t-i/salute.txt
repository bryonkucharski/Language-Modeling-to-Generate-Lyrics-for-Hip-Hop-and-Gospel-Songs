Ay when you see me, salute me like a general I'm leading the troops 
 I make this G shit look so easy to do, 
 And when you see me salute commander and chief conceiling the truth 
 It don't matter wether the streets or the booth. 
 When you see me salute 
 And when you see me salute 
 When you see me salute 
 You ain't gotta speak homie when you see me salute. 
 Raise your right hand to your hairline 
 Stand that attention hold it there until you're recognized 
 Once I return the salutation then is at ease as if you heard no conversation 
 Well, and lets just sayin' what it do g 
 Decorated 5 star general a true G 
 Made it fresher off the battlefield 
 Rip it for my niggas in the battle still 
 Yeah with more stripes then a jail suit 
 Been in the need, trail oop 
 When I fail, through bitches standin their cells 
 Takin' pictures wit their cells 
 And let me tell you sutin 'bout a playa 
 Put me anywhere in any jail 
 And I shall prevail 
 And if another man survived I shall as well 
 Now fuck rap got swag for sale 
 You crossed my path in air brazil 
 Ay when you see me, salute me like a general I'm leading the troops 
 I make this G shit look so easy to do, 
 And when you see me salute commander and chief conceiling the truth 
 It don't matter wether the streets or the booth. 
 When you see me salute 
 And when you see me salute 
 When you see me salute 
 You ain't gotta speak homie when you see me salute. 
 Hot stain from the nonsense 
 Remain conscious 
 The idiots make idiotic comments 
 A convict wit a conscious 
 You lack mores I can see your principles 
 And not my mines is 
 So I guess what makes me special 
 Just to get from the curse 
 Like shit to get you rich at first 
 So put your dick in the dirt 
 That's why I don't gotta be the greatest of all time 
 As long as I keep it real in my rhymes I'm fine 
 I ain't lying 
 Give me mine and I'm satisfied 
 I'm just happy I got to make before my daddy died 
 And all things considered 
 Everytime destiny calls I can deliver 
 Not illa a young heart wit a old soul 
 Some hot holes and a cold flow 
 And as far as keepin' it real go 
 Home when you need me 
 Don't forget the proper way to greet me 
 Ay when you see me, salute me like a general I'm leading the troops 
 I make this G shit look so easy to do, 
 And when you see me salute commander and chief conceiling the truth 
 It don't matter wether the streets or the booth. 
 When you see me salute 
 And when you see me salute 
 When you see me salute 
 You ain't gotta speak homie when you see me salute.
