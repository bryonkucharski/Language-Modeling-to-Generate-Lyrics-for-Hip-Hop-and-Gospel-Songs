(Talking) 
 Yeah... Yeah... Y'all already know what it is, pimp 
 T.I.P., king of the motherfuckin south 
 BGizzzy, let's do it homie 
 Grand Hustle, pimp, Chopper City in here 
 Got my nigga Blok, in this bitch 
 Eastside represent... Westside Bankhead nigga, it is on, what 
 A-town nigga, you know what it is, on through Mechanicville 
 Snow Hill nigga, Pittsburgh, all my real niggas ride out with me 
 Y'all know what's happening, PSC nigga... 
 (T.I) 
 I can give you what you want (want), T.I.P. the hottest (hottest) 
 Game withcha ya need, I can tell ya all about it 
 You can come up in the streets, but it ain't no gettin' out it 
 When I tell ya I'm a "G", pimp, I'm really being modest 
 I can tell ya 'bout the dope boyz, hoes, and the ballers 
 The pimps and the macks, real niggas wouldn't call us 
 Hanging in the traps, cause that's what our daddy taught us 
 From 30's on the 'lac, to a benz on broddas 
 Standin' on the corners, slingin crack and stacking dollars 
 Till it's time to cop a brick, and I'm tired of moving quarters 
 My daddy won't a doctor and my momma won't a lawyer 
 I ain't never had shit, congratulations is in order 
 Tryin' to get a mill for my sons and my daughters 
 If I caught a bad bitch with connections down in Florida 
 Said her daddy and her uncle, still gettin' cross the water 
 I'm richer now, I'd be a motherfuckin fool, if I don't call her 
 What it is my nigga, what it do (what it do) 
 I got a brick or two, I'm finna to buss a move (buss a move) 
 What it is my nigga, what it do (what it do) 
 I got a tool and I'm finna cut the fool 
 What it do, what it do, what it do, what it do, what it do 
 My nigga, what it do, what it do, what it do, what it do, what it do 
 What it do, what it do my nigga, what it do 
 (BG) 
 I'm a H-U-S-T-L-E-R 
 If I don't know you, then fuck ya, If I know ya, I front ya (Propper) 
 But ya gotta break me off, you don't, I catch ya slippin on the block 
 And knock you off 
 I know people, I get nice deals 
 Get'em five dollars, sell'em ten dollars a pill 
 I know people, get ki's for thirteen 
 If I fuck with ya, then get'em for sixteen 
 I know people, get'em three hundred a pound 
 Give'em to ya for five hundred if you my round 
 I'm a hustler, holla at me uptowm 
 I'm well connected with weed, white, tan and brown 
 Come see a nigga, want a nice sixteen 
 You real, we swap work, you fake, it's twenty g's 
 It's like that, I dun been through the struggle 
 I'm running Chopper City, and fucking with Grand Hustle 
 (T.I) 
 I got the... eye of a tiger, and the heart of a bear 
 I'm the king of the jungle you can follow me there 
 Now you can... hear it from these niggas, who hardly was there 
 Or take it from niggas, who fought, and make it a scar to get here 
 Several years ago, I told myself that I solemnly swear 
 Forever be hard to kill, even harder to scare 
 One reason why me and the other cats is hard to compare 
 'Cause I'm fact, that's fiction, it hardly compares 
 Being hated, part of the game, yes it's hard but it's fair 
 Well I'ma be the best hating nigga, see if I care 
 But just know, I'm raising the bar and I'm keeping it there 
 And I'ma still ride clean, throwing weed in the air 
 With two or three bad bitches, got they feet in the air 
 Say they like when I smack on they ass, and skeet in they hair 
 Listen... I don't care if you got the song of the year 
 Ya whole show shut down, if the "Don" appears
