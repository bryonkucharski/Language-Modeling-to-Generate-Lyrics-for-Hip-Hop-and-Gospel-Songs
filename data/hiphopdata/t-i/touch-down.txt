When we touchdown 
 There's no need to ask me, okay 
 Everybody know them Southern boys love that bass 
 Atlanta go bananas, Alabama, Louisiana 
 Mississippi, Tenekeys, every muthafuckin' state 
 When we touchdown 
 Go right from the plane to the range 
 When we touchdown 
 On the private plane, gettin' brain 
 Till we touchdown 
 There ain't no way to keep 'em quiet 
 With T.I. and Shady, baby, we 'bout to move inside a ride 
 When we touchdown 
 When we get in town you know how we getting down 
 Pull a cling and hop on out, snatch all the freaks then walk on out 
 I'm livin', what they talkin' 'bout? I'm shinin' if it dark or not 
 That one hundred DX double R, you'll find that in the parkin' lot 
 You barkin' up the wrong tree, I do this shit for Zone 3 
 4, 5 and 6 as well as 1, Atlanta, I'm forever, son 
 Still be on whatever coast, grindin', blowin' heavy smoke 
 Him you better tell 'em 'fore, won't hesitate to let him go 
 They know I put that green light on them haters 
 Keep on tryin' me, I'll put that beam right on ya tater 
 Now you don't wanna see T.I.P. be irate 
 Just try to keep him in a cage but some how he keep escapin' 
 That's why I be on vacation, Virgin Island I be takin' 
 Private planes out to Spain, now keep on flyin', I ain't fakin' 
 The money ain't a thing, think I'm lyin', you're mistaken 
 You can find long lines and all kinds of bitches your way 
 And when we touchdown 
 There's no need to ask me, okay 
 Everybody know them Southern boys love that bass 
 Atlanta go bananas, Alabama, Louisiana 
 Mississippi, Tenekeys, every muthafuckin' state 
 When we touchdown 
 Go right from the plane to the range 
 When we touchdown 
 On the private plane, gettin' brain 
 Till we touchdown 
 There ain't no way to keep 'em quiet 
 With T.I. and Shady, baby, we 'bout to move inside a ride 
 When we touchdown 
 Welcome to the Midwest, yes 
 Where them Detroit players ball like you have no idea, the boy is here 
 Got the whole place lookin' like its candy painted, ain't it? 
 Like we left the kids at home and just let 'em loose with the crayons 
 Fuck, I just hit a jogger, people lookin' like frogger 
 They Hoppin' out the way whenever they see Marshall's car comin' 
 The kids painted my windows with black, permanent marker 
 And left the rest of the car color cover like swirl pops 
 And I got the bass thumpin' but I'm bound to bump into something 
 Kids are flyin' through the air, lookin' like they're crumpin' 
 The way they're tumbling I gotta do something 
 But soon as I hit the car wash to get the tar off 
 Then it's right back at it tomorrow 
 They're like dead, this is in so get with the trend 
 This is for the pimps listenin' to me, nail polish on the rims 
 And now it's custom chrome but I gotta go do a show 
 So go on with your bad self, just have it back to normal 
 When I touch down 
 There's no need to ask me, okay 
 Everybody know them Southern boys love that bass 
 Atlanta go bananas, Alabama, Louisiana 
 Mississippi, Tenekeys, every muthafuckin' state 
 When we touchdown 
 Go right from the plane to the range 
 When we touchdown 
 On the private plane, gettin' brain 
 Till we touchdown 
 There ain't no way to keep 'em quiet 
 With T.I. and Shady, baby, we 'bout to move inside a ride 
 When we touchdown 
 From my arrival until my departure 
 Guarantee I put this D I C K in somebody daughter, aye 
 I still have my way with the ladies across the water 
 Flew to Paris from Haiti, just some shit that I thought of 
 It's ironic kind of shit that we buy, man 
 Make us psychotical threat to corporate America 
 Then why they runnin' from me? 
 How could they be so ignorant? Look at what hip hop den done 
 It's allowed us to run a business, legimitated our monies 
 Got us out the ghettos and relocated out mommies 
 I made it all the way here, ain't no way you takin' it from me 
 So excuse me, Oprah, honey, I'm sorry, really I promise 
 But niggas, bitches and hoes do exist, I'm just bein' honest 
 But that am I bein' punished, why are you so astonished? 
 Now I ain't got a degree, just intelligence in abundance 
 So you ain't gotta like me, I know millions of folks who love me 
 You can see it how they yellin' and screamin and waitin' for me 
 When I touchdown 
 There's no need to ask me, okay 
 Everybody know them Southern boys love that bass 
 Atlanta go bananas, Alabama, Louisiana 
 Mississippi, Tenekeys, every muthafuckin' state 
 When we touchdown 
 Go right from the plane to the range
