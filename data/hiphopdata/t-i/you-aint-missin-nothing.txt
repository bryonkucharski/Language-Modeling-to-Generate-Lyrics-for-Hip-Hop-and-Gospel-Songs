Hey... Say pimp, this to everybody stretched out behind the wall, 
 Countin' days on their calendar... 
 Flippin' pages, month to month 
 Hey man... I don't give a damn 'bout how other folks treat you man 
 I just wanna let you know pimp, 
 You ain't missin' nothin' homeboy 
 Real talk 
 I know the times seem long, 
 Just try and keep strong 
 Put on your headphones and rewind this song 
 Remember you ain't missin' nothin' homes, 
 I promise you ain't missin' nothin' homes 
 Hey, just now the club on hold and the broads on pause 
 You get home, it's gonna be waitin' on y'all 
 So dog, just know, for real 
 You ain't missin' nothin' homes 
 I promise you ain't missin' nothin' homes 
 On Everything 
 My uncle did a decade, 
 Came home, hit the ground runnin' gettin' paid 
 Like he never did a day 
 Hit the streets, nigga still in the same place they were 
 'Fore we went in the chain gang, 
 And doin' the same thing 
 'Cause the game go on, you only did two days in the joint 
 The day you get locked up and the day you go home 
 I know it feels like the world passin' you by, 
 Like shit happenin' every day out there that you don't know 'bout 
 Everytime you call home your baby momma show out, 
 And your partners don't even send you flicks from when they go out 
 But don't worry 'bout it or stress it, cause shawty know what? 
 The time'll do itself, all you gotta do is show up 
 Keep layin' down wakin' up, 
 And thankin' the Lord 
 And 'fore you know it they gonna open the doors 
 True story, just prepare yourself for it, 
 If you ain't got a plan what you need was a second chance, 
 Shit, you gonna blow it! 
 Learn and visualize what you try to do, 
 And do the time homeboy, don't let the time do you 
 They say the time just flew on the street, 
 Hard to believe from me never but you'll see soon as you on the street 
 I know the times seem long, 
 Just try and keep strong 
 Put on your headphones and rewind this song 
 Remember you ain't missin' nothin' homes, 
 I promise you ain't missin' nothin' homes 
 Hey, just now the club on hold and the broads on pause 
 You get home, it's gonna be waitin' on y'all 
 So dog, just know, for real 
 You ain't missin' nothin' homes 
 I promise you ain't missin' nothin' homes 
 Probably thinkin' it's easy for me to say from here in the booth, 
 But they showed ya, they'd put me in there with you 
 Right now, locked down in the state of the fed, lay in the bed 
 Prayin' it's over and over as you say in your head 
 Yeah, next time I'm a be straight 
 Just count down to my release date... peace of cake 
 My nigga Kap right now, servin' a life sentence for a murder he committed, 
 In self defense 
 And in such good spirits, shawty ain't even trippin' 
 And I could be right in there with him, no bull shittin' 
 He on his ninth year now, just waitin' to get out 
 Got me thinkin' my shit ain't even worth complainin' about 
 'Cause it could still be worse for sho' 
 So you waitin' on me to lose ho, you got to kill me first 
 I talked to my nigga Big Meedge, had to tell him the 
 Streets miss him just as much as he miss the streets 
 Had to let him know whenever he released, 
 We hittin' the club like '03, this time it's on me 
 Yeah we laugh, reminisce for a minute and then I tell him 
 Just nobody ever did it as big 
 It'll never be the same in this city again, closest 
 You'll get is me and Jeezy and them 
 So dog, if it seems like you left behind, ten steps 
 Behind, just know it only gets better with time 
 I know the times seem long, 
 Just try and keep strong 
 Put on your headphones and rewind this song 
 Remember you ain't missin' nothin' homes, 
 I promise you ain't missin' nothin' homes 
 Hey, just now the club on hold and the broads on pause 
 You get home, it's gonna be waitin' on y'all 
 So dog, just know, for real 
 You ain't missin' nothin' homes 
 I promise you ain't missin' nothin' homes
