Aye What's Happenin' 
 All you haters should get at me 'cause I hear ya and 
 I'm watchin' but I'm serious haters so all I gotta say is, 
 What up, what's happenin' 
 All you haters can get at me (hey) 
 'Cause I hear ya and I'm watchin' (hey) 
 But I'm still here I ain't stoppin' 
 So What up, what's happenin' 
 All you haters should get at me 
 'Cause I hear ya and I'm watchin' 
 But I'm serious haters so all I gotta say is what up 
 What it is bro (bro) 
 What it do mane (man) 
 Still the man from the pan to the blue flame 
 Still gettin' dough and make it rain with the loose change 
 I bet that what he did a show, now that's a damn shame 
 I guess that what he hatin' for boy you so damn lame (Sucker nigga) 
 Ya Click the same, a destined bunch of walkin' shit stain 
 Disgraced the A ya give the city such a bad name 
 You way back in my rear view mirror I'm in the fast lane 
 Still I hear ya loud and clear on ya lil' song 
 Go on getcha dissin' on while the king on 
 Your self esteem gone (why) 'cause I'm back now 
 Let's see if we can't teach these niggas how to act now 
 Ya Kissin' ass then, ya just as bad now 
 I check ya ass then, I shut ya ass down 
 And I deliver front and center, never back down 
 Who get the last laugh now sucker nigga 
 I got a front street swag and a side street hustle 
 Center Hill, Cedar Ave. that's where I be sucker 
 South Grand Church Street, the first with that work 
 But we can get it to commercial, if ya need somethin' chirp with 
 Hey what I care bout who you askin', sayin' they ain't heard of me 
 I'm certified, certainly 
 Them videos ain't hurtin' me 
 I still ride with the window rolled down all around the A town like it's finn'a go down 
 If it was ever any questions, niggas finna' know now 
 Won't retire my thrown or surrender no crown 
 I never bow down (Never) 
 And never say die (Never) 
 Just to whom it may concern and who so ever may try 
 I'm forever Westside 
 And the featherweight dies 
 Tell them take your best shot 
 Goin' get yourself hot 
 'Cause I yell Bankhead and you felt left out 
 I ain't mention yo name 
 That's what all this bout? 
 From Summer Hill to the hills up in Hollywood 
 A house full, gettin' to it, you know how we do it (Yeah) 
 Yeah we smoke great (great) 
 And we drink good (good) 
 Then we ball hard, just like G's should 
 Buy what we want 
 Drive what we want 
 G4 up up and away we go, we fly where we want 
 Haters smile like they like it when they really don't 
 Wish they could just wish me away 
 That's what they really want 
 "I really hate his ass" 
 "I don't like him either" 
 "We'll do a song together, maybe then we can beat him" 
 "Somehow he must be stopped" 
 "Somethin' must be done" 
 "If we can't knock him off, let's just try him when he get caught with guns" 
 "Then if he really done (Yeah) and we really won (Yeah) 
 "Any more ideas? " 
 "Suggestions anyone? " 
 "How bout we stay up all night, on the blog sites, 
 Spread vicious lies and nasty rumors we could all write" 
 But that's all right 
 Let the nerds hate 
 Cause in my face though, them words get ate 
 And hatin's hard work, when I just bounce back 
 This God's work 
 Tell all the haters I'm back!
