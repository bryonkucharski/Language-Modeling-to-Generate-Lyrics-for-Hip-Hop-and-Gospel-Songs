I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a flirt 
 Soon as I see her walk up in the club (I'm a flirt) 
 Winkin' her eyes at me, when I roll up on them dubs (I'm a flirt) 
 Sometimes when I'm with my chick on the low (I'm a flirt) 
 And when she's wit her man lookin' at me, damn right (I'm a flirt) 
 So homie don't bring your girl to meet me 'cause (I'm a flirt) 
 And baby don't bring your girlfriend to eat 'cause (I'm a flirt) 
 Please believe it, unless your game is tight and you trust her 
 Then don't bring her around me 'cause (I'm a flirt) 
 Now swear to tell the truth 
 And the whole truth 
 When it comes to hoes I be pimpin' like I supposed to 
 Rollin' like I supposed to 
 Shinin' like I supposed to 
 In the club, fuckin' wit' honeys like I supposed to 
 I don't understand it when a nigga bring his girlfriend to the club 
 Freakin' all on the floor wit his girlfriend in the club 
 And wonder why all these playas tryin' to holla at her 
 Just soon as she go to the bathroom, nigga I'm goin' holla at her 
 A dog on the prowl when I'm walkin' through the mall 
 If I could man I probably would flirt wit all y'all 
 Yeah, yeah homie you say she ya girlfriend 
 But when I step up to her I'm be like cousin 
 Believe me man, this is how them playas do it in the Chi 
 And plus we got them player-ette flirters in the Chi 
 Now the moral of the story is cuff yo bitch 
 'Cause hey I'm black, handsome, I sing plus I'm rich and (I'm a flirt) 
 Hey homie, if you ain't gettin' no money 
 You better keep her away from me ya dig 
 Well if you love ya girl 
 And wanna keep ya girl 
 Don't be walkin' up and askin' me to meet ya girl 
 'Cause I'm well enough a flirt when I speak to girl 
 She winked her eyes on the slide 
 I seen you girl 
 Better treat your girl right 
 'Cause another man will 
 Better eat ya girl like another man will 
 'Cause you leave your wife 
 And I see ya wife 
 That be for real 
 How long you think that's finna be ya wife 
 Well I'm livin' the life 
 You just gettin' it right 
 Your old lady look at me 
 'Cause you ain't hittin' it right 
 She probably used to like u 
 'Cause you you the better type 
 That's until I came along 
 And put some dick in her life 
 Wanna see me dance 
 I noticed she was checkin' me 
 And diggin' the ice 
 And if I get that tonight 
 Better hit that twice 
 I can even make her mine 
 If I hit that right 
 You know smack that thang 
 Sit that right 
 Upon that dresser 
 Yeah that's right 
 Pullin' on her hair 
 Like we gettin' in a fight 
 Yeah I know it's kinda tight 
 But it'll settle just right 
 So if yo girl sexy 
 And she test me 
 Don't be upset g 
 'Cause you might catch me 
 Tryin' to catch a glance up her skirt 
 We playing in my glam in reverse 
 Then if I see her and I like her then I'm a flirt 
 When I, when I, when I, when I pull up to club 
 All the shawties be like (Damn 28's) 
 Then I be like girl you know just who I am (Don't hate) 
 See I done fell in love wit a stripper y'all 
 All I do is flirt with her, and I get them draws 
 And I don't need no help, I got it down pact 
 Teddy Paine was born to flirt now you can't down that 
 Now I'm flirt with her whether I'm in or out of town 
 That's why they call me teddy bend her ass down 
 I be like como si llama, lil' mama mi llamo pain, what is yo name

 And I'm hopin' you feel the same
