(T.I talking) 
 Damn, has it been that long? (haha) 
 Say what happens since I been gone 
 They got the game all wrong, it's too pretty in here 
 Let's say we take it back to the trap one time 
 I went from rolling wit' dem rocks on the block 
 To controlling my position at the top 
 Of every chart I will not, stop 
 (We ride, and we roll, man you stop) Yeah we go, yeah we go 
 (Hey, hey, hey) 
 (Yeah you know, yeah you know, yeah you know, yeah you know, 
 Yeah you know, yeah you know) 
 Girl we ride, man we roll, and you stop, 
 And we go, and we go (go) 
 In the middle of a fight, I'm so cool 
 Everybody want it hot I go through 
 All of this half of which would have broke you 
 Came out smelling like a rose even more true 
 Worldwide, bi-coastal, global, nigga's I respect posted 
 'Cause I get it don't mean they do too 
 'Cause I ain't got a damn minute ain't no 'tude 
 You know we never not goin' all in 
 Kickin doors over just to let my dogs in 
 So many rides never catch a nigga walkin' 
 In a G-5 tryna put a bunch of broads in 
 Then we landin' laughin'. chicks with fantastic asses 
 Extravagent habitats, if you never seen tragic happen (hey) 
 Make magic happen with cash I'm actually catchin magic 
 In the market for lavish mansions 'n' NBA expansions 
 I was passin out Phantoms and old folks sold that dope 
 Way past respect you see, but I neva as big as a nigga felt a beat ya see 
 I went from rolling wit' dem rocks on the block 
 To controlling my position at the top 
 Of every chart I will not, stop 
 (We ride, and we roll, man you stop) Yeah we go, yeah we go 
 (Hey, hey, hey) 
 (Yeah you know, yeah you know, yeah you know, yeah you know, 
 Yeah you know, yeah you know) 
 Girl we ride, man we roll, and you stop, 
 And we go, and we go (go) 
 So fly why would I wanna land for 
 Everything you could ask for and more 
 Your choice, you could even be a fanboy 
 Hate to see a nigga get a hundred grand more 
 Bein' a motherfuckin' man, won't stand for 
 The rap wars, always goin' back and forth 
 Livin' in a blood killing like cancer 
 But when getting brain, that's for damn sure 
 Get more friends, universal get more seaweed 
 The same people on tour, on TV 
 They signed him shoulda kept your receipt 
 Get a refund cause you sure can't see me 
 Who keeps CD's on repeat, stuck in MP3's for 3 weeks 
 At the gates on the day I was released 
 The only time you will ever see me free 
 Big money J, much as you can get for it? 
 Atlantic records say just make another hit for me 
 I tell 'em cut a hundred million dollar check for me 
 Like it or not, don't lose no respect for me 
 Never mind what I did, cause the best commin' 
 I'm the king in a game like chess to me 
 So put the cash in tha bag, 
 Give the rest to the attendant puttin' gas in it... 
 I went from rolling wit' dem rocks on the block 
 To controlling my position at the top 
 Of every chart I will not, stop 
 (We ride, and we roll, man you stop) Yeah we go, yeah we go 
 (Hey, hey, hey) 
 (Yeah you know, yeah you know, yeah you know, yeah you know, 
 Yeah you know, yeah you know) 
 Girl we ride, man we roll, and you stop, 
 And we go, and we go (go) 
 I got a new swag and it's a new day 
 Here we go again too, what it do 'J? 
 I'll give you a call, I know the way you used to move yay 
 Now I gotta new Audemar with a blue face 
 Hoppin' up in G4 jet no suitcase, whole new wardrobe in a new place 
 Chain close superstain if a stain on my shoelace 
 T.I. roll like sushi... touche. 
 If ya can't lay back, who the hell am I? 
 Bringin' homocide to the gang, no alibi 
 Can't tell a lie to the judge, I'm guilty 
 Your Honor do you mind the guy tried to kill me 
 I could still be, in a trap now 
 AK 'round, little yay 'round 
 100k downstairs by the trey pound. 
 But if they wonderin who runnin' the A yeah you know... 
 (Yeah you know, yeah you know, yeah you know, yeah you know, 
 Yeah you know, yeah you know) 
 Girl we ride, man we roll, and you stop, 
 And we go, and we go (go) 
 Yeah you know that we ride 
 In control we don't stop 
 We gon blow where we drop 
 Let you know we on top 
 Girl we ride, man we roll, and you stop, 
 And we go, and we go (go)..
