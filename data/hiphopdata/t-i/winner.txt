T.i.p 
 Hey Jamie, J-T 
 (Ooh) 
 It 'bout time to get back hot again man, 
 You know I'm fresh out this thing 
 Lets go 
 You know you looking at a winner (winner, winner) 
 I'm so up there and so out there 
 Your so not here 
 You see we so up there and so out there 
 (Let me get it right here first) 
 I'm wakin' 
 Up in the morning 
 Hustlin' to the stage and fuckin' performin' 
 Bustlin' in through the hate and bustin' the door in 
 Lately nothin' misses I must have been scorin' 
 Speakin' of the misses 
 I'm watchin' 'em pourin' 
 Just like a drink that I'm enjoyin' 
 And don't mean bottles you welcome to join in 
 Just look at me soarin' 
 Feelin' like Jordan 
 (Ah ah) hold up I ain't finished yet 
 On top but you just don't get it yet 
 I don't get cut 
 I make 'em cut the check 
 Can't hear me in the stands 
 Lemme say it again 
 (Ah ah) you ain't heard I'm the shit 
 On top but you just don't get it yet 
 I never got cut but I make 'em cut the check 
 So hate on but guess what 
 I feel like I can't miss 
 I know they want me to fall 
 But ain't nothin' bigger than this 
 So just pass me the ball 
 You know you looking at a winner, winner, winner 
 I can't miss, can't lose, can't miss 
 You know you looking at winner, winner, winner 
 'Cause I'm a winner 
 Yeah I'm a winner 
 I'm stepping out in the evenin' 
 Keep women screamin' 
 He gotta be cheatin' 
 But I'm so breezy 
 I make this look easy 
 No fakin' I'm seasoned 
 You gotta believe me 
 I went from TV's 
 To screens to D-V-D's 
 To C-D's, 
 To M-P-3's overseas 
 I got no time to talkin' its borin' 
 Just look at me soarin' 
 Feelin' like Jordan 
 (Ah ah) hold up I ain't finished yet 
 On top but you just don't get it yet 
 I never got cut 
 I make 'em cut the check 
 Can't hear me in the stands 
 Lemme say it again 
 (Ah ah) you ain't heard I'm the shit 
 On top but you just don't get it yet 
 I never got cut but I make 'em cut the check 
 So hate on but guess what 
 That's right, 
 You see the Porsche Panamera 
 Got 'em in hysteria 
 The turbo super fast and that McLaren even scarier 
 Hear me turning corners burning rubber in your area 
 I'm hard to follow once I pop the clutch and hit the throttle 
 I'm recession proof 
 I don't run the money, money run to me 
 In this economy guess I'm considered an anomaly 
 Bugatti's, Maserati, new Ferrari's I've got one of each 
 My future bright tight like picture guy in front of me 
 Turn pain to progression in every studio session 
 Passion into perfection to failure I'm an exception 
 Fuck, if you wanna lose, to battle me is a blessin' 
 You couldn't die in the hands of a better man 
 I ran from the bottom to the best no auto-tune 
 Been in the lead, say you seen King follow whom? 
 Never that, I'm the freshest go ask whoever that 
 King back money long as an old Cadillac 
 Ha ha 
 I feel like I can't miss 
 I know they want me to fall 
 But ain't nothin' bigger than this 
 So just pass me the ball (it's the King bitch!) 
 You know you looking at a winner, winner, winner 
 I can't miss, can't lose, can't miss 
 You know you looking at winner, winner, winner 
 'Cause I'm a winner 
 Yeah I'm a winner 
 Hey man you thought a little vacation could hold me back homeboy, 
 Man I'm back man 
 Brighter than ever, you understand that, 
 If you didn't like me then (ha) you gon' hate me now nigga
