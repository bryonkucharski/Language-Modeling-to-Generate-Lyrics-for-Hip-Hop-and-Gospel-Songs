 (You should let me) 
 Just relieve your stress (relax) chill your ring finger 
 And freeze ya chest 
 Cop you a new beamer the beads is next 
 And even though it's a want I need the sex 
 I hope it's just insecurity 
 'Cause I know she feelin' me 
 Diggin' the growth and the maturity 
 But I got hard luck 
 'Cause honey keep keepin' her guards up 
 So I'm just tryna' even the odds up 
 And that part sucks to have to keep goin' back in on her 
 When she knows that I been on her 
 Since Back in the days in Manhattan after the matinee 
 When she just happened to wave 
 That's when I knew she had the right shine (right shine) 
 And the right mind (right mind) 
 It's just on me to catch her at the right time (right time) 
 When I get her Imma grab her by the wrist 
 Pull her close to me, hug her and tell her this 
 Baby you should let me love you, let me be the one to 
 Give you everything you want and need 
 Baby good love and protection 
 Make me your selection 
 Show you the way love's supposed to be 
 Baby I just don't get it, do you enjoy being hurt? 
 I know you smell the perfume, the make up on his shirt 
 You don't believe his stories you know that they are all lies 
 As bad as you are you stick around and I just don't know why 
 If I was you man baby you'd (never worry about) 
 What I do (I'd be coming home) 
 Back to you (every night doing you right) 
 Your the type of woman (deserves good things) 
 Fist full of diamonds (hand full of rings) 
 Baby you're a star I just want to show you, you are 
 Baby you should let me love you, let me love you, 
 Baby you should let me love you. 
 (You should let me) Love you, 
 Let me love you baby you should let me love you 
 Baby you should let me love you, let me love you, 
 Baby you should let me love you. 
 (You should let me) Love you, 
 Let me love you baby you should let me love you 
 Baby you should let me love you, let me love you, 
 Baby you should let me love you. 
 (You should let me) Love you, 
 Let me love you baby you should let me love you 
 What you want a cruise? 
 Avenues and a ride with a pair of shoes 
 Shining like a diamond sittin' high with raised latitude 
 (Ah ha) listen baby I could change your attitude 
 You chillin' with the king you ain't dealin' with them rapper dudes 
 (Hey) keep it real kick it with me is what you rather do 
 I was poppin' before you, gonna' be the same after you 
 I ain't gonna chase you, I'd rather replace you 
 In case you wonderin' I'm stuntin' and way major 
 If the ice don't matter, and the money don't phase you, 
 Cars don't impress you, I bet the sex will amaze you 
 Look you don't want to past the chance (hey) 
 Spend the summer in the bottom half of France 
 Don't be alarmed I don't mean no harm 
 I'll help you before I hurt you 
 I'm tryna' rebirth you 
 I wanna love you 
 I ain't just have to nail you 
 You already know I can show you 
 Better than I can tell you
