Five (5), Four (4), Three (3), Two (2), One 
 You done when I see you (David Banner, banner) 
 Five (5), Four (4), Three (3), (yeah, yeah) Two (2), (ay) One 
 You done when I see you (ay) 
 Five (5), Four (4), Three (3), (yeah, yeah, yeah), Two (2), One run 
 You done when I see (see) you (you) (ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ay) 
 Five (5), Four (4), Three (3), Two (2), One (what it is pimp I know y'all miss me man) 
 You done when I see (see) you (you) 
 Five (5), Four (4), Three (3), Two (2), (here I am muthafucker), One run 
 You done when I see (see) you (you) (ay) 
 What it is the king back in the building 
 Still stacking and building 
 Still rappin' to children 
 Jeopardizing ya deals, ballin buyin ya wheels 
 Like it's back when we was lil and it's still time to kill 
 Quick displayin ya skills 
 Way underpayin ya bills 
 Spend a day in the field 
 So how you sayin' you real 
 Niggaz could never live how I live, you ain't deserving 
 My lifestyle's urban, never met me in person 
 Just my bread suburban, in a red suburban 
 On 24?s, 20 hoes givin' head, I'm swerving 
 Fuck boys piss they pants, scared and nervous 
 I'm shell-shocked, black out like I been in the service 
 Clean cut and reserved, but I tote George Garvin 
 The closest thang you hoes seen to picture perfect 
 Your rose gold king, my ring tight as a virgin cop 
 Your dream I stopped fo I seen the top, nigga 
 Five (5). Four (4), Three (3), Two (2), (what!), One 
 You done when I see (see), you (you) (ya days are numbered shawty) 
 Five (5), Four (4), Three (3), Two (2), One run 
 You done when I see (see), you (you) (countdown pimp) 
 I treat the beats like the streets 
 On 'em I do what I want to 
 I ain't gotta confront you, I'll kill you if I want to 
 Roam amongst monsters, kill homes and front you 
 That lil nigga swearin he bad, eat him for lunch too 
 Fuck you niggaz, Dominique slam dunk you niggaz 
 Sucker punch aan one of you niggaz 
 I was being nice at first now I'm runnin' through niggaz 
 Whole crews, not just one or two niggaz 
 'Cause you ain't representin the south, you just embarassin 
 See you on TV in New York, them niggaz laugh at us 
 The reason why D.J.?s didn't have a clue I was fabulous 
 Now a days, not playin' my records well, hell it's hazardous 
 All this cussin, fussin, loud discussion's out of my character 
 Bustin' these niggaz melons and threatnin all of they managers 
 P.$.C. is Atlanta, so how you playin' and handlin 
 Gorillaz wit bananaz, without playin' and banishing 
 King of the south, it was said once then 
 Took a while to comprehend, now it all sunk in 
 On the low, deal a mil, I ain't done, come again 
 Room dead, scene fled, fo the fedz runnin' in pimp 
 Comin' live from the terror dome 
 Shinin lights on niggaz who got they skirts on tight wit mascara on 
 All I have ever known, is 28 in the zone 
 Give me a day and its gon, a brick of yay and it's on 
 You have never known, me to run less I'm gunnin at niggaz domes 
 And runnin' 'em out the own territory 
 Every story got a flip side to it, and ya disc ain't shit less the click ride to it 
 And I'm gon show you how the Westside do it 
 In the A, not Cali, Bankhead, Simpson Valley 
 Every crack in every alley, sellin crack to every Tom, Dick, and Harry 
 Every Kim, Sue, and Sally, till I tally up 
 A big enough knot to buy me a yacht 
 So then my pistols and my patnaz really all that I got 
 I'm not, playin' at all, I'm sprayin 'em all 
 Still drop 'em down to size if they say that I'm small man 
 Pussy cats can't worry ya dawg 
 Throwin' stones at the throne, I'm a bury ya all man 
 Know ya faggot niggaz hate that I'm ballin 
 Makin' 30k a day and blow it all at the mall and man I 
 Can't relate to what you rap on stage 
 Nigga 'cause I been sellin yay since I was bow wow's age nigga 
 Hear my daddy and cousin talking to me from the grave 
 And all they sayin' is young nigga get paid
