I gotta grind, won't stop 
 Hustle won't quit 
 Shine like no other, I be on some other shit 
 I got a high price lifestyle super bad bitch 
 If I want it, then I got it 
 If I don't then all I gotta do is 
 Go, get it, stay about my bidness 
 Ball till I fall, floss until I finish 
 I can go, get it, stay about my bidness 
 I'm living just to kill it, stacking million to the ceiling 
 Everyday I ball brown, all I wanna do is ball 
 Put my money over bitches, put my hustle over all 
 Louie down to the drawers, Luis Vuitton kicks 
 Got a man, how to swagger, bitch I'm stupid dumb sick 
 With a group of young bitches and they stupid dumb thick 
 I'm the marathon man, all I do is run shit 
 A sophisticated convict, superficial, still official 
 Multimillion dollar shit 
 Money is the object, hot shit 
 Bitch I got a sawnoff on my arm 
 See bigger with no diamond 
 They just talk about they got it, 
 I'm the upper echelon, though 
 Bitch I'm bout that action, you could go on with that convo 
 I have done more than you dream bout 
 Get your dream bitch and your dream house 
 On lean passing them beans out 
 With a bad crew, the whole team high 
 Go on boy, get seen by, bro you know me, you know I be 
 Stacking that dough, that's all I see 
 I g.o. g.e.t. i.t. 
 I live life, up late night 
 Get shit fake when I take flight 
 I get paid, no sick days 
 My outfit's so switch blade 
 Don't sniff yay, but I blow dro 
 Bank roll on loco 
 Still ride with that 44 
 Don't let my P-O know 
 Bad white bitch super thick 
 I'm Ice T, she Coco 
 She got another bitch, other bitches 
 Her ass fat, face so-so, no paper triail 
 No phone call, no emails, no photos 
 Just backshot, with that fat butt 
 And low blow headbutts in slow-mo 
 Purple label polo and a crew that's what I do 
 Man I strive and roll my denim in my new Margiella shoes 
 Man, we be cool if we just parle 
 On Margharita Molly and the strong? 
 We menagin' for a hobby 
 We kick it how we kick it 
 Know you envy how I'm living 
 Just can't resist the 
 Get the million bout my business 
 Bro you know me, you know I be 
 Stacking that dough that's all I see 
 I g.o. g.e.t. i.t.
