 I said, get right, but you know what I got 
 Got them fixing up they make-up when I walk up in the spot. 
 Got they eye shadow when they lips on shine, 
 With a smile on her face, when her lips on mine, 
 See I'm a big freak, 
 Feed her big peter, beat that pussy up so good she don't want me to eat her. 
 First I meet her then I beat her... whatever she need. 
 A few of these turn a nigga wifey to a cheater, 
 Keep her! 
 Head down and her ass up here, 
 Got her hair fucked up and her lipstick smeared 
 Take a city bitch here or a bitch from the boonies, 
 Wit a man at the crib but he don't know what he doing... hold up 
 Truefully she knew she do me, but she knew me, 
 Introduce me and she blew me and then she didn't say nothin' to me, 
 You don't like it then sue me 
 She my biggest fan now 
 When I spend a day in town, then she hurry up and lay me down... down! 
 She love me up and lay me down! 
 Ay what she do? 
 She love me up and lay me down!

 Got dope dick, give it to her till she O.D 
 I'm a put it in her in the life, give her what she missin' 
 She yo wife well she off limits, well that is unless you slippin... 
 And I catch her on a mission in my hotel lobby, 
 Trying to run into somebody, end up at the after party 
 Wit a striper body, itty bitty waist 
 Big ol booty beggin me to decorate her pretty face 
 (Hey... ok)

 Broad looking for that raw, shawty I'm that nigga 
 Ain't playin' witcha, full of Remy high sober 
 You catch me in your city lick me up I bend you ova 
 Know da... women want me and niggas think it's the money, 
 But she should be paying me tho... it's the dick she gettin' from me, from me.
