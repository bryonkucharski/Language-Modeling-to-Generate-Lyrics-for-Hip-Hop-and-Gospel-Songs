I'm a pimp tight, nigga ridin' clean after midnight 
 Ready for the gun play, prepared for a fistfight 
 Run up on your bitch and ask her what that pussy hit like? 
 At first she actin' funny, but in a minute I knew she'd get right 
 Get down, got her fuckin' with another bitch now 
 I'm king of all ice so remember this tip town 
 And you ain't ready pussy nigga better set it down 
 We mag night and rock steady nigga spittin' rounds 
 Turn ur stomach to spaghetti when you hit the ground 
 Toss the choppas in the chevy now we mashin down 
 Camilton, countin' all your benjamins and hamiltons 
 As far as I'm concerned your just a job for the janitors 
 Don't disregard I'm a guard you're an amateur 
 Hidin' behind your body guards and your manager 
 I pimp hard through all the pages in the calendar 
 Bitch is Pimp Squad, it's all action no cameras 
 You know what it is, You know what it is 
 You know what it is, You know what is is 
 Shorty we bury niggaz, Shorty we bury niggaz 
 Shorty we bury niggaz, Shorty we bury niggaz... the undertaker 
 You know what it is, You know what it is 
 You know what it is, You know what is is 
 Shorty we bury niggaz, Shorty we bury niggaz 
 Shorty we bury niggaz, Shorty we bury niggaz... the undertaker 
 Yo, standin on the trap with me, mashin' me is best for me 
 1000 round magazine, my partner say no attemptin' me 
 I'm A to the average B, respiratory ???, fruit chevy, H-IC, my lyrics hit like HIV 
 Spray by me, state patrol, murder comes like day to me 
 Bullets chip your l-i-p and dirty all your h-i-p's 
 Shout out to your homies where they're feedin um through they IV 
 From the westside where they say I be 
 The way I be, the ruler of all I survery I be 
 Laid back, Yay's back, Triple Kiwi Maybach 
 Weed match the benz, Cush triple kiwi'd 80 pack 
 Old school baby crack, I'm tryin' to bring the 80's back 
 Haitians give me hated crack, 'cause my momma hated crack 
 Till we got evicted and I came through and done ate his ass 
 Playa back, we rhyme we I live, I'm a zone 3 hustla niggaz know what it is 
 May we all bow our heads, and pray for this nigga 
 The undertakers comin' any day for this nigga 
 They hate um' in the hood, from the dreams he been sellin' 
 I read the paperwork and it seems you was tellin' 
 You know what it is, and you know who I'm talkin' bout 
 When the feds came, I didn't open up my mouth 
 What you scared for ???, niggaz know you've been a hoe 
 It was like homie, shit was all good just a week ago 
 Get the goons ready start up your vehicle 
 And shoot at any fuckin' car you ain't seen before 
 Pick up the shells, and we use an automatic 
 They gave 50 years to my nigga lil' travis 
 See I'm movin trap, and let um trip over the wires 
 And then he'll be layin', right by the preacher and the choir 
 Catch um before I do, T.I. go and handle your biz 
 When you see me holler at me homie you know what it is...
