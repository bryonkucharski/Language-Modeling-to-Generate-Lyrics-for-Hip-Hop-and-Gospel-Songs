All right man, y'all win 
 I won't say it, at least for this song, hey 
 Said they lookin' for the realest, well I'm real as it get 
 Rap to the nigga dealin' hard who live in the jects 
 Till some better nigga wit her, ain't delivered 'em yet 
 My mouth big, but I got a pistol bigger than that 
 I live and die by my respect so I honor the code 
 Peep niggaz who be out here flexin, stuntin for hoes 
 And if you ain't never chose to remember nothin' before 
 Just know the game is some you win, some you don't 
 But you already begin again, start, it go 
 Learn to shoot a pistol, flip a O, how hard it go 
 Man if you ain't ever heard of Pimp Squad before 
 You better ask a real nigga or a broad you know 
 Cause you ain't ready for the pros, get it outta ya brain 
 You in over your head, way out of your lane 
 I been sayin' I'm filthy rich and got it from caine 
 So would you say them niggaz know if they done got it the same, right? 
 Cause you know who, you know what 
 Of the you know where, goin' against us, too unfair 
 Cause everywhere you do a show, we got kinfolk there 
 And now you know I ain't no more, not a tinfolk there 
 It's you know who, you know what 
 Of the you know where, beef now don't you go there 
 And if you do, don't use our copy producers, he won't care 
 If he leave the hood alone, pimpin' he won't share man 
 I know you think you out there gettin' it in 
 But whatcha doin', I done did it once and did it again 
 I had a choice between runnin' while living in sin 
 He done settlin down, turnin' nine millin or ten 
 I give a damn if I never sell a million again 
 I gotta thank you a million for just lettin me in 
 But now I'm settlin in, gettin' used to the view 
 On top, won't stop till I'm huger than you 
 Gon flop? Who? Me, pimp you losin your screws 
 We gotta dope if you lettin niggaz shoot into you 
 You ain't ready for the shit I'm introducin to you 
 The roof in the back of the park ain't translucent as you 
 So now your nigga dressin up, man do what you do 
 I got style, pimp, it's more than just the suit and the shoe 
 This been proven, I'm the truth, stamp government seal 
 I'm what it is, these other niggaz just Southern with deals, for real
