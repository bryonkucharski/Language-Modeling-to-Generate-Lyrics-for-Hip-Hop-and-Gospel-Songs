The-Dream: 
 We said we'd never be 
 Just a memory 
 And even though it breaks my soul 
 Still I never let your heart go 
 We're running way too fast 
 Chasing down that blue grass 
 Hope I didn't break your soul 
 And know I never let your heart go 
 Aight man, remember all a nigga had 
 With 20 grand cash, it was all in the bag 
 And we got it all with the crack 
 Lookin' for the plug in the mall with the gat 
 No, you never loan me a pair but he loan me a ride with it all in the back 
 How could you just call me with that 
 Acting like you think you gettin' all of it back 
 Still remember standin all alone in the trap 
 Waitin on a plate, lookin' for a way 
 And damn a big car pull up on me one day 
 Got a homie [?] 
 Huh, and it's been long since then 
 Damn can't believe you been gone since then 
 Huh, I really miss my nigga 
 Tramel [?] this for you, know you up there nigga 
 The-Dream: 
 We said we'd never be 
 Just a memory 
 And even though it breaks my soul 
 Still I never let your heart go 
 We're running way too fast 
 Chasing down that blue grass 
 Hope I didn't break your soul 
 And know I never let your heart go 
 Ay, if you miss your nigga like I miss my nigga 
 Sing, sing 
 Ite, on the inside nigga you still tough 
 Ay, remember when we just 16 
 Mind on one thing, gotta be street kings 
 Now we numb like morphine 
 To the gunplay everyday is a war scene 
 But y'all was my nigga 
 No matter what I knew I could call on my nigga 
 And any bullshit involving my niggas 
 30 rounds in the clip, spray it all for my niggas 
 Yeah, cap, we were just teenagers 
 Provin to the g's in the hood we able 
 We ball on these haters 
 Doin' a movie screen made ya, you and me playa 
 Damn, why they have to give my nigga life 
 We can ball like a God till we bring him back 
 Really miss you nigga and ain't a motha fuckin' lie 
 Pimp squad till we die, free my nigga cap 
 The-Dream: 
 We said we'd never be 
 Just a memory 
 And even though it breaks my soul 
 Still I never let your heart go 
 We're running way too fast 
 Chasing down that blue grass 
 Hope I didn't break your soul 
 And know I never let your heart go 
 Huh, I admit it I've seen 
 Back in the day how silly I seemed 
 Selling cocaine wasn't really my dream 
 Could get my family farther than anyone seen 
 Ay, and if anyone seen where I made it today probably really one thing 
 One 12 in the face, no he finna run games 
 Ain't gon trick me into sayin' one name 
 Nope, well go sit in the cell about that 
 For weeks I was mad in a hell about that 
 Police sayin' shit really wasn't my shit 
 It was his and he knew I wasn't playin' bout that 
 Hey, for every time I'm strapped 
 The 12 ride by, they ain't finding my strap 
 Judge woulda had a nigga heart by that 
 A nigga woulda sensed some blood by that 
 The-Dream: 
 We said we'd never be 
 Just a memory

 Still I never let your heart go 
 We're running way too fast 
 Chasing down that blue grass 
 Hope I didn't break your soul 
 And know I never let your heart go
