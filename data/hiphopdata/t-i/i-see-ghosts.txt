Hey I think I seen a ghost 
 Half a million dollar car, ain't even got no note 
 Bitches layin' on the bed, bitches on the flo' 
 Money to the ceiling, money come and money go 
 I think I seen a ghost, I think I seen a ghost 
 Hamiltons and Franklins, they come in every show 
 Money to the ceiling, how you love you can go 
 Graveyard in my pockets, dead presidents to blow 
 I think I'm seeing ghosts 
 Money burning in my hand while I'm still counting 
 We put drivers in the seats, I'm in the back lounging 
 My bitch she don't even speak no English when she come in town and 
 I'm seeing dead people, man I got like four accountants 
 It's all my yayo in that pot we need a water fountain 
 We put that yayo on the East and full ten countin' [?] 
 I'm counting dirty money, I don't need no help to count it 
 It had blood, it had sweat on it when I found it 
 I'm going higher than a elevator out the country 
 I do whatever for that paper, it ain't on my country 
 I went to sleep inside a ghost, I think it was a phantom 
 Man I get rock and roll high, dog I'm off the channel 
 I got sixty racks on me just in case she want to gamble 
 And I go crazy with that back, it ain't nothing I can't handle 
 I'm in my room with the light off, burning candles 
 Youngest nigga with the set, repping Atlanta 
 This money timid, hear motherfuckers talk money 
 I inhale bills, breathe Gs, cough money 
 I'm still making cake even when I lost money 
 A multimillionaire, still spending soft money 
 I'm balling way above par, got golf money 
 The bus full of duffel bags and that's all money 
 You wonder what my motivation? Bro, it been money 
 Make extra jet cause my little mama love to spend money 
 We Texas Hold 'Em, rolling dice with your rent money 
 Get out my face and fuck your life if you ain't getting money 
 Say boy, I spend the money you're trying to make 
 Sell a hundred Gs and it's sad to say 
 Big dough, I get that 
 In a fear? Push your shit back 
 I'm arrogant and I'm cocky 'cause I got a graveyard in my pocket 
 Spent 100K on my chain and a couple mill on my watch here 
 My chick ride in that car you in 
 This city, I argue in 
 Get big money, no little dough 
 See dead presidents, real ghosts 
 Boo! That's the look on the haters face when I pull up in the ghost like Casper 
 Ooh! That's what your boo said when she snuck a peek at me right before we got ghost 
 On my chopper with a chopper, they call me Ghost Rider 
 I swear my pen dripping, I should be a ghostwriter 
 I see them suckers, I get ghost 
 I don't fuck with busters 
 Too busy sitting ghost, you know how that goes 
 Give me more, give me more 
 Yeah I ghost that work 
 Whip it like Goldberg 
 Yeah I ghost that word 
 Heavyweight, Goldberg, I'm a wrassler, ho 
 Clothesline that bankroll, I be wrassling ghosts 
 Chauffeur find our way back, trunk passengers ghost 
 Got my green from the Bay, ghost ride the whip 
 Hey man, Hallelujah in my True Religion denims 
 Yeah, Rocko do the most, pocket hundred full of ghosts
