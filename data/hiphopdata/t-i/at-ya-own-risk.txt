Usher: 
 Don't be bullshitin' with me 
 I don't care if you've got a boyfriend or not, girl 
 It's at ya own risk if you kick it with me 
 'Fore it be over you be spending the night, girl 
 I can see, you look like you're ready to ride 
 And girl obviously, it's mutual, ooh you wanna give it to me 
 Ridin' off in Hollywood 
 Kicking it with hotter bitches, all they get's a lot of wood 
 Give it to 'em hardcore, all they do is holla good 
 Her ex he be short strokin', I lean in it follow through it 
 She's so sexy, her complexion say she from Bollywood 
 In my section, I wonder will a thousand dollar do it 
 If not a fifty or a hundred, still I gotta do it 
 You surely would, if you were me then for sure you could 
 Get her and her partner out the honda 
 Have 'em both fuckin' and suckin' to mañana 
 Hey nigga you with baby he don't want no problem 
 If your man ain't a killer, what the fuck I care about him 
 No comparison ain't nothin' rare about him 
 Witness saying he was just standing there and then they shot him 
 Trigger got no heart when that thing squeeze 
 Or they catch a body to make you my main squeeze, yeah

 Ralph triple black, Bentley matte white 
 She said she don't like girls, she did that night 
 They were taking turns, I was taking flights 
 In competition man them bitches hit that pipe 
 Going down on it 
 If it ain't a bad bitch then I don't want it 
 Ain't no mediocre 
 Experiment with pretty bitches, that's the shit I told her 
 As long as they got pretty toes and they ain't got a odor 
 And showed her, how to stack paper to foldin' 
 Colder than eskimo shoulders 
 You strong with it, I don't play 
 Tote four four for the vultures 
 Eat pussy Lord yes is she looking gorgeous 
 And you're just a lot of talk 
 Them three got on the molly then the four of us we got it off 
 And they ain't get paid like they playing college ball 
 Go out receive a cock and balls 
 Bullshit me, not at all

 Usher: 
 Quit playing with me 
 I know you got a nigga he just gon' be mad at me 
 So if you love 'em, think he's special, don't come home with me 
 'Cause when I get you to my crib you gon' belong to me 
 I understand if you don't wanna go 
 Just know what's gon' happen once we get through the door 
 Promising you something you never seen before 
 Say you with me if you down I ain't tellin' nobody 
 So tell me what you gon' do 
 When you ready you can fall through 
 You can bring a friend too 
 Say you with me if you down I ain't tellin' nobody 
 So tell me what you gon' do 
 Yeah you can fall through 
 You can bring your friend too
