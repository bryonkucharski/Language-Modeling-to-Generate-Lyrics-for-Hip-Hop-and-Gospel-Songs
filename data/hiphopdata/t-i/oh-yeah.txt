Wherever you are, I'm sorry I'm gone 
 Them bitches say they miss me, tell 'em shawty not long 
 Got them so turned on till they so turned out 
 'Cause I'm so turned up and I'm burnin' that loud 
 I pull up, hop out, all the bitches like wow 
 Catch me at fillet chow up in Vegas in town 
 It's a sold out crowd bitches from the front row 
 Up to the nose bleeds and they all wanna go 
 No they all wanna go, I make 'em say 
 Ay, they all they wanna go, ay don't they trey 
 Hey if your girl wanna go tell her say 
 And if that broad wanna go she should say 
 Now from LA to the bay, I make 'em say 
 And from New York to MIA, bitches say 
 From Chi Town to the D, bitches scream 
 San Louis Houston do you wanna go with me 
 Hey you can catch me in Atlanta with my pedal to the floor 
 On that 5, 99 guts like a bloody nose 
 Ain't no secret how I kick it nigga everybody know 
 'Bout my paper sorry no time for you haters gotta go 
 When I'm on the westcoat in that ghost on that low 
 One five for a movie, quarter mil for a show 
 Gotta pill in a bottle for the rod for a ho 
 Sweet heart to a lady, still hard on a ho 
 Thank God for my lady I know they be on that radio wiling 
 While we chilling somewhere on an island, smiling 
 On a big dot is he really that hot 
 Ain't you too niggga guess not 
 Bitches hoppin' on my dick, 'fore I hop up out the car 
 Walk away with five or six as I'm passing by the bars 
 See I'm tuggin' on my zipper as I fire up my cigar 
 Let's get this straight, you go get naked get it crackin' till tomorrow 
 Wherever you are, I'm sorry I'm gone 
 Them bitches say they miss me, tell 'em shawty not long 
 Got them so turned on till they so turned out 
 'Cause I'm so turned up and I'm burnin' that loud 
 I pull up, hop out, all the bitches like wow 
 Catch me at fillet chow up in Vegas in town 
 It's a sold out crowd bitches from the front row 
 Up to the nose bleeds and they all wanna go 
 No they all wanna go, I make 'em say 
 Ay, they all they wanna go, ay don't they trey 
 Hey if your girl wanna go tell her say

 From Chi Town to the D, bitches scream 
 San Louis Houston do you wanna go with me 
 Yeah we in the same book, but I'm on another page 
 Peach king off the leash out the cage on the streets 
 Kill nigga like A's cut bitches like blades 
 Shine always, fuck you when whatever y'all say 
 Bitch nigga I'm paid even when I'm locked up 
 Heard nigga went broke, well shawty not us 
 Quarter K in the Benz they say shawty washed up 
 To a bitch, bullshit then shawty popped off in yo motherfucking town 
 Just to show it's going down, my brother and my lil cousin got you lady goin' 'round 
 Nigga I don't want her, I'm so superior by far 
 She'll never see the inside of my car 
 Wherever you are, I'm sorry I'm gone 
 Them bitches say they miss me, tell 'em shawty not long 
 Got them so turned on till they so turned out 
 'Cause I'm so turned up and I'm burnin that loud
