Hey, hey, hey 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 If you can't hear, what I'm tryna say 
 If you can't read, from the same page 
 Maybe I'm going deaf 
 Maybe I'm going blind 
 Maybe I'm out of my mind 
 OK, now he was close 
 Tried to domesticate you 
 But you're an animal 
 Baby, it's in your nature 
 Just let me liberate you 
 You don't need no papers 
 That man is not your mate 
 And that's why I'm gon' take you 
 Good girl! 
 I know you want it 
 I know you want it 
 I know you want it 
 You're a good girl! 
 Can't let it get past me 
 Me fall from plastic 
 Talk about getting blasted 
 I hate these blurred lines! 
 I know you want it 
 I know you want it 
 I know you want it 
 But you're a good girl! 
 The way you grab me 
 Must wanna get nasty 
 Go ahead, get at me 
 What do they make dreams for 
 When you got them jeans on 
 What do we need steam for 
 You the hottest bitch in this place! 
 I feel so lucky 
 You wanna hug me 
 What rhymes with hug me? 
 Hey! 
 OK, now he was close 
 Tried to domesticate you 
 But you're an animal 
 Baby, it's in your nature 
 Just let me liberate you 
 You don't need no papers 
 That man is not your mate 
 And that's why I'm gon' take you 
 Good girl! 
 I know you want it 
 I know you want it 
 I know you want it 
 You're a good girl! 
 Can't let it get past me 
 Me fall from plastic 
 Talk about getting blasted 
 I hate these blurred lines! 
 I know you want it 
 I know you want it 
 I know you want it 
 But you're a good girl! 
 The way you grab me 
 Must wanna get nasty 
 Go ahead, get at me 
 (Hustle Gang Homie) 
 One thing I ask of you 
 Lemme be the one you bring that ass up to 
 From Malibu to Paris, boo 
 Had a bitch, but she ain't bad as you 
 So, hit me up when you passin' through 
 I'll give you something big enough to tear your ass in two 
 Swag on 'em even when you dress casual 
 I mean, it's almost unbearable 
 Honey you not there when I'm 
 At the bar side let you have me by 
 Nothin' like your last guy, he too square for you 
 He don't smack that ass and pull your hair for you 
 So I'm just watchin' and waitin' 
 For you to salute the truly pimpin' 
 Not many women can refuse this pimpin' 
 I'm a nice guy, but don't get confused, you git'n it! 
 Shake your rump 
 Get down 
 Get up 
 Do it like it hurt, like it hurt 
 What, you don't like work? 
 Hey! 
 Baby, can you breathe? 
 I got this from Jamaica 
 It always works for me 
 Dakota to Decatur 
 No more pretending 
 Cause now your winning 
 Here's our beginning 
 I always wanted a 
 Good girl! 
 I know you want it 
 I know you want it 
 I know you want it 
 You're a good girl! 
 Can't let it get past me 
 Me fall from plastic 
 Talk about getting blasted 
 I hate these blurred lines! 
 I know you want it 
 I know you want it 
 I know you want it 
 But you're a good girl! 
 The way you grab me 
 Must wanna get nasty 
 Go ahead, get at me 
 Everybody get up 
 Everybody get up 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 Hey, hey, hey
