T.I. 
 Now I don't really care what you call me 
 Just as long as you don't call me rude 
 I bet they knew as soon as they saw me 
 "Goodnight, it's over with", that's all she wrote 
 Streets like cold Chicago 
 Ain't nothing new, I've seen it all before 
 But still I ball like no tomorrow 
 "Goodnight, it's over with", that's all she wrote 
 All she wrote, all she wrote 
 "I said it's over with", that's all she wrote 
 All she wrote, all she wrote 
 "Goodnight, it's over with", that's all she wrote 
 T.I. 
 It's stupid how I'm going knowing everybody knowing that 
 I'm sewing up the game, destroying like they hate me for it 
 Eventually see they can't beat, than with me they join 
 Others sworn under oath, or banished left completely scorn 
 You tell lies, get caught, nigga kick rocks 
 You never did blend in with the big shots 
 On the fast track, ain't no need for no pit stops 
 I just laugh at, nigga wishing it was this hot 
 Guess they mad at me, huh? Really pissed off 
 Better that than pissed on 
 I'm the Jetsons you the Flintstones 
 Catch me in the end zone 
 High stepping prime time 
 Thought you niggas been on 
 Ain't no blocking my shine 
 Like my new air Yeezy's, you can see me in the night time 
 I get rich off living life, you check to check reciting rhymes 
 So call me what you want, wanna hate, have a nice time 
 While I get stupid paper, hey my dough ain't in its right mind 
 Now I don't really care what you call me 
 Just as long as you don't call me rude 
 I bet they knew as soon as they saw me 
 "Goodnight, it's over with", that's all she wrote 
 Streets like cold Chicago, 
 Ain't nothing new, I've seen it all before 
 But still I ball like no tomorrow 
 "Goodnight, it's over with", that's all she wrote 
 Eminem 
 Your staring straight into a barrel of hate 
 Terrible fate, 
 Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape 
 Cupid shot his arrow and missed 
 Wait Sarah, you're late, your train left. 
 Mascara and egg smear on your face 
 Night's over, goodbye, hoe 
 I thought that I told ya' the spilled nut ain't nothing to cry over 
 Never shoulda' came within Range of my Rover 
 Shoulda' known I was trouble soon as I rolled up, 
 Any chick who's coming up after I blindfold her, 
 She still comes back to my crib, 
 Must want me to mess with her mind hold up. 
 She must've took me for some high roller. 
 But I won't buy her a soda 
 Unless it's rock 'n' ride cola. 
 Buy you a bag of fritos, I wouldn't let you eat the fucking chip on my shoulder. 
 If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't die for ya 
 Try'na pull 5 bucks from me is like try'na pull 5 molars 
 You get your eyes swole up I'm on my straight grizzly 
 So why would I buy you a gay ass teddy bear bitch, you're already bi-polar... 
 Eminem 
 Now I don't really care what you call me 
 You can even call me cold 
 These bitches know as soon as they saw me 
 It's never me to get the privilege to know 'em 
 I roll like a desperado, now I never know where I'm gonna go 
 Still I ball like there's no tomorrow 
 Until it's over and that's all she wrote 
 T.I. 
 The credit roller, curtain closer, movie over with 
 But don't get mad at me 
 Go blame the chick who wrote this shit 
 Your life is sure a bitch 
 But she know I'm rich 
 That why she give me what I want and I just throw her dick 
 Here I go again 
 I kick this shit, give a damn, got it pouring in 
 Peso, Euro, Yen, ah ha, I'm paid, never gon' be broke again 
 See me posted in anything, wearing any chain 
 Never gon' see me toting anything 
 All you gon' see is BANG! 
 It's so nice where I kick it, 
 Hate you never get to visit 
 Yeah I'm on another level 
 But you niggas still can get it 
 It's all over 'fore you finish 
 Sorry bro, this road, we end it 
 Won't give you the satisfaction of me giving you the business 
 Eminem 
 Yeah I guess life is a bitcha, ain't it, TIP? 
 And this one can say this shit 
 Shirt off my back, I wouldn't give you the dirt of my handkerchief 
 I'm giving these hoes a dose of there own medicine 
 Let 'em get a good taste of it 
 I'm sure you got that relationship memo by now, 
 But in case you didn't 
 This is so bad, better stick your nose to your forehead and staple it 
 Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wasting it 
 So I pace this shit a little bit quicker 
 That clock come racing in double time in it 
 But I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time 
 It may take you pricks to catch on 
 While you strong arm like Stretch Armstrong 
 Man I still say K-mart's like there's an apostrophe-S on it, dog 
 And they say McDonalds isn't a restaurant, well, I guess I'm wrong 
 But if you gon' tell me that the A&W ain't the spot for the best hot dogs 
 You can get the "F" on dawg 
 T.I. 
 And on my throne I remain, all alone in my lane 
 I'm as strong as they came 
 They were gone 'fore they came 
 Now I don't wanna hang, I slap fire with them rap guys 
 They just wanna sabotage my hustle shawty, that's why 
 Eminem 
 Now I don't really care what you call me 
 You can even call me cold 
 T.I. 
 I bet they knew as soon as they saw me 
 "Goodnight, it's over with", that's all she wrote 
 Eminem 
 I roll like a desperado, now I never know where I'm gonna go 
 T.I. 
 But still I ball like there's no tomorrow 
 "Goodnight, it's over with", that's all she wrote 
 All she wrote, all she wrote 
 "I said it's over with", that's all she wrote 
 All she wrote, all she wrote 
 "Goodnight, it's over with", that's all she wrote
