I know you Miss Me 
 I know you Miss Me 
 They say the city ain't the same in a night like die 
 Since T.I.'s inside like the streets been quiet 
 I know you Miss Me 
 I know you Miss Me 
 I know I Know 
 The say the dugs ain't ballin' and the dubs ain't fallin' 
 Like the club been sorry, but I'm back now shawty, ay 
 I know you Miss Me 
 I know you Miss Me 
 I know I know 
 Yeah 
 You know I do it for the city and everybody descending 
 The generals and lieutenants salute high representors 
 Since I've been sittin' a minute no-everybody be missin' 
 Me walking off in the club 
 Gettin' everybody attention 
 When I'm out record with spinnin' 
 They start it from the beginning 
 Get bottles of Christian Remy 
 And pass it out to the women 
 Pull out a stack of 20 
 Throw it up to the ceiling 
 Watch it fall to the floor 
 Start throwin' some more 
 Has anybody you know 
 Whatever part it you go 
 With me in the VIP 
 Know that shit was outta control 
 If I pull up in a Mercedes 
 I hop in out of the road 
 Continue hatin' but hey 
 I'm the fly-est guy that you know 
 Ay, East coast, West coast, me in way south 
 I keep a fire marshal at the go stressed out 
 Mine stretched around the corner, shut the whole event down 
 Been a minute in the city since it really went down, man 
 They say the city ain't the same in a night like die 
 Since T.I.'s inside like the streets been quiet 
 I know you Miss Me 
 I know you Miss Me 
 I know I Know 
 The say the dugs ain't ballin and the dubs ain't fallin' 
 Like the club been sorry, but I'm back now shawty, ay 
 I know you Miss Me 
 I know you Miss Me 
 I know I know 
 I'm gettin' calls every evening, sayin' the streets need me 
 I'm at it just as soon as I make it pimpin' believe me 
 Niggas talkin' greasy but they don't wanna see me 
 They know where to find me, soon as they release me 
 Remember me and Jeezy, at least once a week we, 
 Hit the strip club, show these niggas how to treat freeze 
 One stack, two stacks, three stacks, four, 
 Nigga, five Stacks, go tell me bring ten more 
 And Lamborghinis and Apollos 
 They see me they screamin' holla 
 The robbers follow the ballers, so peg it soon my proudest 
 Still ain't nobody hotter, I put that on my daughter 
 Long as I be sittin' still, niggas still ain't cower 
 Atlanta you know I run it, everybody is Spanish 
 They gotta stay in their houses like everybody were punished 
 Tell them they to quit frontin' and them suckas sit down 
 Let 'em know the king comin' and he shut this shit down 
 They say the city ain't the same in a night like die 
 Since T.I.'s inside like the streets been quiet 
 I know you Miss Me 
 I know you Miss Me 
 I know I Know 
 The say the dugs ain't ballin and the dubs ain't fallin' 
 Like the club been sorry, but I'm back now shawty, ay 
 I know you Miss Me 
 I know you Miss Me 
 I know I know 
 And every time I take the city back 
 And wear my crown, nigga give me that, that, that 
 I know you Miss Me 
 I know you Miss Me 
 I know I know 
 And I do my thang 
 Stack my millis 
 Now it time for me to bring back my city, ay 
 I know you Miss Me 
 I know you Miss Me 
 I know I know 
 They say the city ain't the same in a night like die 
 Since T.I.'s inside like the streets been quiet 
 I know you Miss Me 
 I know you Miss Me 
 I know I Know 
 The say the dugs ain't ballin and the dubs ain't fallin' 
 Like the club been sorry, but I'm back now shawty, ay 
 I know you Miss Me 
 I know you Miss Me 
 I know I know
