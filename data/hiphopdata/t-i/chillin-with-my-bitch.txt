Dig pimp... I'ma holla at y'all in a minute, I'm finna go change clothes mayne 
 Go get real spiffy mayne, go kick it with my broad, ya nigga hold it down aight? 
 I left the kids at the crib, and the squad in the trap 
 Now I'm in the two-seater with my broad in my lap 
 The alpines beatin', but I'm far away from rappin' 
 Bumpin' Prince, Sade, or some Marvin Gaye perhaps, I 
 Put up my blues, put on some tailor made slacks 
 Some wing tip shoes, whachu know about that?(Ha) 
 Button down, cufflinks, hair cut, no hat (Yeah) 
 Just felt like gettin' clean and show I know how to act 
 At Neiman and Marcus let my girl blow three or four stacks 
 Gotta forever to cut the food, and damn I'm relaxed (Chillin') 
 In a real cool mood, no beef, no gats 
 But there real close by, niggaz better know that 
 (Jazze Pha) 
 I ain't hangin' with my niggaz, pullin' no triggaz 
 I'll be back to the trap, but for now 
 I'm chillin' with my bitch today, I'm chillin' with my bitch today 
 I ain't hangin' with my potnaz, I'm out eatin' lobster 
 I'm on some grown man shit, ya dig 
 I'm chillin' with my bitch today, I'm chillin' with my bitch today 
 This shit look hard, no drama from none of my baby mama's 
 With my hottie, takin' shots of Saki at Bennihannas 
 Known to kick it like we riches, like Sky Richie and Madonna 
 Or either Will and Jada, on vacation for the summer 
 Me and my lil' mama, blowin' big as we wanna 
 Gotta big sack of some of that shit from California 
 A bottle of Patron and a six pack of Corona 
 Dro aroma got the six hot and steamin' like a sauna 
 So I let the top back and I bend anotha corner 
 Check into the W, so I can put it on her 
 Got the suite for a week, but we can stay a lil' longer 
 I ain't trippin', that's the shit that make relationships stronger 
 I ain't hangin' with my niggaz, pullin' no triggaz 
 I'll be back to the trap, but for now 
 I'm chillin' with my bitch today, I'm chillin' with my bitch today 
 I ain't hangin' with my potnaz, I'm out eatin' lobster 
 I'm on some grown man shit, ya dig 
 I'm chillin' with my bitch today, I'm chillin' with my bitch today 
 I ain't hangin' with my niggaz, pullin' no triggaz 
 I'll be back to the trap, but for now 
 I'm chillin' with my bitch today, I'm chillin' with my bitch today 
 I ain't hangin' with my potnaz, I'm out eatin' lobster 
 I'm on some grown man shit, ya dig 
 I'm chillin' with my bitch today, I'm chillin' with my bitch today 
 Tonight I'm gon chill with my lady friend 
 She the type to keep a nigga open 
 I'm chillin' with my bitch today 
 I left the stress in the streets and I'm a long way from home 
 Put up the vest and the chrome, even threw away with my phone 
 My potnaz don't wanna be on the shit that I'm on mayne 
 Livin' life and kickin' it like a grown man 
 Sittin' in the sand, drinkin' pina coladas 
 With a double shot of rum, just chillin' right by the water 
 No judges, no lawyers, in a whole 'nother world 
 Just a bottle and this O a dro, blowin' with my girl 
 I ain't hangin' with my niggaz, pullin' no triggaz 
 I'll be back to the trap, but for now 
 I'm chillin' with my bitch today, I'm chillin' with my bitch today 
 I ain't hangin' with my potnaz, I'm out eatin' lobster 
 I'm on some grown man shit, ya dig 
 I'm chillin' with my bitch today, I'm chillin' with my bitch today 
 I ain't hangin' with my niggaz, pullin' no triggaz 
 I'll be back to the trap, but for now 
 I'm chillin' with my bitch today, I'm chillin' with my bitch today 
 I ain't hangin' with my potnaz, I'm out eatin' lobster 
 I'm on some grown man shit, ya dig 
 I'm chillin' with my bitch today, I'm chillin' with my bitch today 
 Tonight I'm gon chill with my lady friend 
 She the type to keep a nigga open 
 I'm chillin' with my bitch today 
 Tonight I'm gon chill with my lady friend 
 She the type to keep a nigga open 
 I'm chillin' with my bitch today
