 Young Buck: 
 Uh Oh, Young Buck 
 Dirty South, Yeah 
 I Hear Him Talkin', But He 'Bout To Get That Ass Stomp 
 Watch, I Get The Club Crunk, I'm'a Make 'Em Stomp 
 We Ain't Playin' want to Front, You Can Get That Ass Stomp 
 Do It Like Them Dirty South Boys, Do, And Stomp 
 Now Where You From? Who The Boss? I'm'a Break Him Off 
 Where You From? Who The Boss? Lemme Break Him Off 
 Now Where You From? Who The Boss? I'm'a Break Him Off 
 Where You From? Who The Boss? Lemme Break Him Off 
 I'm Caddillac'n Through The Hood, Sittin' On 24's 
 TV's Playin', Rim's Spinin, Blowin' Plenty Dro 
 Don't Have To Mention, When You Pimpin', You Get Plenty Hoes 
 It's All On You, If You Gon' Trick, Or You Gon' Get Yo' Dough 
 I Know I Got These Haters Mad, I Can Love That 
 When You Got Love For The Streets, They Give Ya' Love Back 
 Look In My Eyes, You Can Tell I Ain't Never Scared 
 Poppin' Them Thangs, I'm Rockin' My Chain Anywhere 
 If You Gon' Represent Your Hood, What You Waitin On? 
 Security Better Back Up, When They Play This Song 
 And We 'Bout 50 Strong, Please Don't Make Us Do You Wrong 
 My Click Of Gorilla's, They Got They G-Unit's On 
 All Of That Mean Muggin' Really Don't Mean Nothing 
 C'mon Take It Outside, Lemme See Sumthin 
 Wha-Wha-Wha-What Now? 
 Don't Get Bu-Bu-Bu-Buck'd Down 
 Stop All That Hatin' Or This Club Gon' Get Shu-Shut Down 
 Now Where You From? Who The Boss? I'm'a Break Him Off 
 Where You From? Who The Boss? Lemme Break Him Off 
 I Hear Him Talkin', But He 'Bout To Get That Ass Stomp 
 Watch, I Get The Club Crunk, I'm'a Make 'Em Stomp 
 We Ain't Playin' want to Front, You Can Get That Ass Stomp 
 Do It Like Them Dirty South Boys, Do, And Stomp 
 Now Where You From? Who The Boss? I'm'a Break Him Off 
 Where You From? Who The Boss? Lemme Break Him Off 
 Now Where You From? Who The Boss? I'm'a Break Him Off 
 Where You From? Who The Boss? Lemme Break Him Off 
 The Game: 
 G G G G-Unit, comin' straight outta Compton, lace up my G-6's, and I'm A-Town Stompin, got ten thousand cash in my pocket, let the pump in, 'cause Luda and Young Buck always gettin' me into something, low rider out front, I'm trying to get into something, step on Bank's shoe one more time, and I'mma start bustin', rose gold in my grill, I got a dirty mouth, and a bitch wit a fat ass, from the dirty dirty south, I wasn't tryin' to get the cover of the double X-L, just tryin' to fuck Mya, 'cause Dre said sex sells, don't be mad at the rocks in my fuckin' chain, don't be mad 'cause your bitch chose Buck and Game, you see the logo tatted on my neck, the same one I'm autographin' on the chest, put your bottles in the air for Ya-yo, he on house arrest, and on behalf of 50 Cent, this is G-Unit West,

 Ludacris: 
 Muthafucka, I'm A Monster In This Game, Similar To The Lachness 
 My Rhymes Is Nappy Rooted, Sum Verses Gotta Process 
 The Truth In This Booth, Ain't No Doubts When I'm Rappin' 
 If I Say It, I've Either Done It, Or It's 'Bout To Happen 
 When I Pull Up In The Louis Truck On 26's, People Dumb Out 
 If Lifes A Crap Game, I'm Rollin' 7's On The Come Out 
 These Rapper's Think I'm Ig-nent, Love Sayin' My Name 
 'Cause Maintainin My Fish Tank, And They House, Cost The Same 
 Ask Me, I'd Say I Made It, And It Sure Wasn't Luck 
 Becuz Hustler's Relate To Me, And Some Are Younger Than Buck 
 You See I'm Married To My Music, But We Got A Prenupt 
 So If That Bitch Don't Act Right, I'm Still Gettin' My Cut 
 My Deals Never Get Screwed, My Contracts Practice Abstinence 
 I'm Masterin This Program, Hazin' These Undergraduates 
 So, Pimpin' Be Easy, Quit Catchin' Feelings 
 'Cause You Worth A Couple Hundred Grand, And I'm Worth Millions 
 Nobodys Thinkin' About You, Plus Your Beef Ain't Legit 
 So Please Stay Off The T.I.P. Of My Dick
