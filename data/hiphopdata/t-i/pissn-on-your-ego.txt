Automatic bullet flow 
 Uzi, Calico 
 Ladies man, Yeah, but to that pussy I'm a bully tho 
 Beat it, eat it, let it go 
 Retarded, stupid, silly tho 
 This city been on life support 
 I'm gonna get out and kill it tho 
 Really tho, off the chain 
 Getting it, doing heavy things 
 Stuntin out the frame 
 Still to bust a nigga cabin mayne 
 God like charlemayne 
 In the A the hottest thing 
 Ever hit it, ever did it no these nigga [?] 
 I ain't finna front, nigga lame if you ask me 
 I'm way in the front, run shit, no athlete 
 Passionly, nigga watch my smoke as I go and get money to the top I go 
 Tell you get dough, nigga stop I know the housekeeper get more 
 Now come and mop my floor 
 Sittin' up high, small money we don't see no 
 Stupid, dumb fly ask yo bitch nigga she know 
 Nigga know my stylo, swagg on GO 
 Shittin on yo pride nigga pissin on yo ego 
 We be Pissin on yo ego, pissin on yo ego 
 Shittin on yo pride nigga pissin on yo ego 
 We be pissin on yo ego, pissin on yo ego 
 Sucka nigga hatin' we know but we pisson on yo ego 
 I'm back up on my rap shit, you bastards got it backwards 
 Got it twisted and exaggerated 
 Stretched out: elastics 
 You niggas ain't on my radar! 
 I bypass niggas, no gastric 
 I pull up front in that monster truck 
 And I park that shit Jurrassic 
 Got a drunk bitch on my mattress 
 Doing backflips, gymnastics 
 She holding on to that monkey bar 
 Yelling out my name: no ad-libs 
 Niggas get mad at us for what? 
 We live out life at the after-party 
 Don't come at me with that ego shit 
 I piss on that like a port-o-potty 
 This beat is retarded so therefore my flow is autistic 
 Come on down to Bobby's World 
 You and your friend all a visit 
 Flow like I'm on a mission 
 So there is no competition 
 It's looking like hunting season 
 And we in the slaughter business 
 Ball hard: pavement 
 Broads in amazement 
 Large money talking, I ain't gotta make a statement 
 My impatient grind, I'm taking mine 
 I ain't finna wait for mine 
 Anybody wanna shine, I suggest you wait in line 
 I'm chasing dime paper 
 But for these haters I don't break a stride 
 Defecating on your pride, make you commit suicide 
 Do or die, who am I? 
 Bullet hit the Bulls-eye 
 I'm doin' my thing, Say I ain't my nigga you a lie 
 Do it by the hood, I grew up to say what's up 
 And all the real niggas know me, I don't need no introduction 
 Bulletproof truck with a couple cute [?] in the back 
 Doin' everything I ask for a wrap what's that 
 They handle that and I struck that cat so good I get my money back
