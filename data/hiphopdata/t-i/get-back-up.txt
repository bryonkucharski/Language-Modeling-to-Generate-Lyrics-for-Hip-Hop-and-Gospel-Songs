 I'm only human dawg 
 I'm only human dawg 
 I'm only human dawg 
 (Chris Brown) 
 Can you forgive me 
 It's an SOS to let me be me 
 (T.I) 
 Ay, ay, ay listen to me 
 And when they push you down, 
 You got to get back up 
 And when they push you down, 
 You got to get back up 
 (T.I) 
 Push the dirt off your jersey than go for the cup 
 Or the trophy or the ring, champion no matter what 
 'Cause when you got the belt and the ring 
 People with ya poppin' bottles, taking pictures look around 
 As soon as you fall down all the haters pass a judgement 
 Surprise, I'm here to show that I'ma rise above this 
 Ay, what it is World 
 Yeah it's me again, back before you, at your mercy 
 Don't bend your knee again, no running from the truth 
 As much as we pretend, that it ain't what it is, than it hits CNN 
 Apologies to my fans and my closest friends, (I'm sorry) 
 For letting you down, I won't take you down this road again 
 Most of you now saying whatever, here we go again 
 Blogs, radio, and television all going in 
 I laugh to keep from crying through all of the embarrassment 
 I gotta say you f-cking haters is hilarious 
 How dare you sit right there and act as if you holier than thou 
 Point your finger now with me looking down 
 Same clown that was twitpic'ing at my wedding 
 On the same twitter page disrespecting 
 Wait a second (hold up) 
 Never mind my imperfections this is fact, remember that 
 No mistakes too great to recover and bounce back 
 (Chris Brown) 
 And when they push you down, you got to get back up 
 And when they push you down, you got to get back up 
 (T.I) 
 Push the dirt off your jersey than go for the cup 
 Or the trophy or the ring, champion no matter what 
 'Cause when you got the belt and the ring 
 People with ya poppin' bottles, taking pictures look around 
 As soon as you fall down all the haters pass a judgement 
 Surprise, I'm here to show that I'ma rise above this 
 (T.I) 
 I admit, yeah, I done some dumb sh-t, 
 Disappointed everybody I know 
 Try not to hold that against me though 
 My road to redemption has no GPS 
 So guess the time must be invested for this to be manifested 
 Yes it's hard living life in the spotlight 
 Trying to dodge the haters same time as the cop light 
 The bible say "let he without sin cast the stone first" (stone first) 
 The sinner or the one who judged him, who was wrong first? 
 Yeah he go to work, never done no drugs or to be fair 
 He just drink his liquor, touch his kids, beat his wife instead 
 Difference is, my shortcomings hit the media 
 Thanks to TMZ, the AJC and Wikipedia 
 See the stairway to heaven while stepping down Jacob's ladder 
 My good outweigh the bad, God, ain't that what really matters, nope 
 A matter of fact I'm wrong but after that the good I've done in your hood 
 Should it overshadow that? 
 Got the World laughing at me for the moment 
 But it gonna be your turn 'fore it's over with 
 Even if you so legit that you get a house with a dog and a picket fence 
 The people with you then but when they turn on you remember this 
 Push the dirt off your jersey than go for the cup 
 Or the trophy or the ring, champion no matter what 
 'Cause when you got the belt and the ring 
 People with ya poppin' bottles, taking pictures look around 
 As soon as you fall down all the haters pass a judgement 
 Surprise, I'm here to show that I'ma rise above this 
 (Chris Brown) 
 Hello, out there 
 Can you hear me 
 Can you hear me 
 Ah, ah, ah, ah 
 Can you (hear you) 
 Hello, out there, 
 Can you hear me 
 You gotta get you 
 You gotta gotta believe in me 
 Hey 
 (T.I) 
 I accept full responsibilty for the all the wrong I've done 
 If y'all thought I were perfect 
 I apologise for being human man 
 But never again partner 
 You can put my life on that 
 And you can love me, or you can leave me 
 Before you judge me, just let me be me 
 And you can love me or either leave me 
 Before you judge me, see life ain't easy
