(T.I) 
 Hell no I can't quit 
 Hell no man we got to much money to get shawti stay down grand hustle 
 Look... 
 IM this far from being a star and just that close to quittin 
 I never should of came close to missing 
 But I want to be a musician pimpin' not a politician listen feel my position this a rough transition 
 Plus I'm way to deep in the game to be trying to change 
 From fortune and fame and glamour I could be in the slammer 
 Or six feet under Atlanta it's a blessing to breath I walk the streets with seven felonies I'm blessed to be free 
 Long as somebody up in heaven who keep blessing the G T.I.P is still be blessing CD's so haters you can see these 
 'Cause I'm back now with something to prove everything to gain pimpin' nothing to lose 
 I oughta start smackin niggas when there's nothing to do 
 They to big shoot 'em in the leg and even the odds cause you ain't hard 
 Less you round with captain C ROD Trap with KT and brawl with JR 
 Fuck hoes with DP broke bread with JG 
 Switch labels like KP poofa did all that to me even 
 Though I'd rather go back to slangin drugs an shit 
 This a gang of niggas and bitches really love this shit 
 I Can't Quit 
 Even though Police's hate on legit 
 And rappers hate it 'cause they know I'm the shit 
 Hell naw I can't quit 
 Some niggas hatin' on the money I'm getting 
 Most of them hatin' 'cause I'm fuckin' they bitch 
 Naw pimpin' I can't quit 
 Some niggas hatin' on the rocks and the rings 
 Some of them hate 'cause they don't think I'm the king 
 Hell naw I can't quit 
 People hate it when you better then them 
 They ain't hate start worrying then 
 Hey I'm winning I can't quit 
 (T.I) 
 Ten years an album and two deals fo' real we all know I should of sold two million at least 
 It's all good though I flow for the streets I do it for y'all every weekend see who in the mall 
 Still in the traps signing your shirts given you doubt 
 Kikin it with ya' then get yo' and your folk into the club 
 Holes of the pictures where girls gave kisses and hugs 
 Hold and I look at the show passing niggas the drove 
 One of the realist rappers niggas will know 
 But niggas be hatin' to the point where they be calling the station 
 But they respect it 'cause I'm ready and focused 
 Then I see they panties an vocals, I want you to know 
 This the closest you know this 
 Niggas in the game ain't real got to stay sellin records cause the fame ain't shit 
 And fuck the units that they name will sell 
 They'll break your hearts and see your favorite rappers lame as hell

 Some of the people some of time times 
 Some of you rhyme but might not like one of them lines 
 I tell you, I let you criticize me one of them times 
 Those of you that think I'm to cocky get in front of the line 
 Whether you don't like my ego or my arrogant flow 
 Don't like it when you say I'm tyte 
 I say I already know 
 Don't like how I was talkin' shit before my album blowed 
 Think I need to calm it down become more like the average Joe 
 So, fuck yo' little thoughts and that little house you think I'm in 
 Get a Benz I value your opinion then think I give a fuck how many times my record spins 
 Well what you recommend, I'm back again
