 They say the game fucked up and the records ain't sellin 
 It was bad in 06' gettin' worse in 07' 
 Market over saturated with all the bootleggin 
 When it seems better shawty ain't no tellin' 
 Well, call Lyor, give him this message 
 Then hit K'ys tell hiim, tell Kevin, 
 Craig, Julie Greenwald, all of them present 
 The fifty mill you gave me, was a sound investment 
 This time around we gon sell 5, no less than 4 on a slow day, call vegas and bet 
 By the way, if you a winner, I'm the one you should be with Hit J, Tell them niggas to bet against 
 Grand Hustle homie, I'm a make you respect this 
 They say "the market share down", so... I ain't affected 
 Tell the label relax, ain't no need to stress shit 
 Just cut the check and I'll handle the rest... shhiit

 You hear my name so hot, I got the game on lock 
 You niggas keep floppin, But I remain on top 
 Still the same ol' me, With the same ol' glock 
 From the first CD, With the Kangol top 
 I was hollerin dopeboy when I first came out 
 It seems like everyone in the dope game now man 
 I told these niggas that it ain't gon stop 
 All the hatin' gon' stop or this thang gon' blah 
 Most of these niggas, ain't slang, no blocks 
 Got a lil' somethin', but it ain't so hot 
 Try to sell a record when my shit drop 
 Get the cover of the magazine when my shit out nope 
 I think not just why, if you ever eye with a nigga this fly 
 You better watch your mouth, you ain't that high 
 KING OF THE SOUTH, you ain't that guy

 To the fans and the critics, think hip hop is missing 
 This is a lil' proof that hip hop livin' 
 You can hear a hip hop top now, just listen 
 Now see a hip hop walk out with 6 bitches 
 In the ATL, see hip hop chillin' 
 In a multimillion dollar crib hip hop building 
 You know how many cars hip hops driven? 
 Nigga I'm everything hip hop's missing 
 Nigga you is everything hip hop isn't 
 My heart and my soul, where hip hop live at 
 To anyone whos ever said hip hops finished 
 It can't be dead while I'm still livin' in it 
 I'm livin' (and well, might I add that)
