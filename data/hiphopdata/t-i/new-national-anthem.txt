 I know radio prolly ain't gonna play this... but chopper going off in the hood man like Afghanistan or the Gaza strip somewhere man. Yeah, we hear it so much we probably numb to it by now. After all, it's the American way right?

 Free just to murder me 
 (Land of the handgun) 
 Land of the beautiful 
 (Home of the shotgun) 
 Cursed by the hate we throw 
 (Ya dead if ya ain't got one) 
 Is this the new national anthem? 
 (It was like this before I got here, baby I ain't do it!) 
 (I ain't start it I'm just a part of it) 
 Is this the new national anthem? 
 Turn it!

 You say this the home of the brave I guess 
 I say this the home of the K's and the vets 
 All alone with the J's smoking yay 'cause he stressed 
 On chrome with a Tec taught to spray for respect 
 I learned from the best used to stay in the "'jects" 
 Bought work from the vets burning rubber in the 'Vettes 
 This as good as it gets used to play with the rats 
 Then I got older and learned stay away from the rats 
 God blessed this nigga, to hustle up and make eight figures 
 Turned from a goon to a great young nigga 
 No complaining just doing what it take young nigga 
 I was raised in a decade of hate young nigga 
 Always dodging polices because they hate young niggas 
 And we hate them too, 38 in him shoe 
 All the changes the system will take him through 
 He ain't a killer but he will if you make him do it 
 Homicide he'll ride, they'll put him on trial 
 Let him have a life sentence then do it with a smile 
 And he only 19, he ain't even had a child 
 As a child, told his mama he'll be gone for a while 
 And she cried, still they just put him inside 
 Now she all on her own because her other son died 
 Listen to the politician as he lied and he lied 
 He a snake in a suit, trying to hide in disguise

 (Well damn officer what did I do? 
 Naw hold up man don't shoot, I live over there 
 Ay, man what you doing? 
 You trippin', dawg 
 How many times has that ever happened to you, what the fuck do you know about being a black man in America? 
 And you wonder why we walk around with straps)

 For the stars and the stripes prison bars and the pipe 
 Young nigga rolling weed in a cigar he can light 
 Bang red either blue selling hard and the white 
 Live by the gun, never run from a fight 
 Trayvon in a hoodie, walking through the neighborhood he 
 Didn't do shit to buddy, he didn't have to die did he? 
 I guess it's because his dad was a judge in the city 
 They didn't want him in the pen with the thugs that could get him 
 A jury of his peers said all was forgiven 
 But touch one of mine, right or wrong, I'mma kill them 
 Fill them with the lead like they put in Martin Luther King's head 
 Like they killed Malcolm X, Edgar Hoover did that 
 You can catch me in the hood where they shooting niggas at 
 They don't know if Neighborhood or the Hoovers did that 
 Whether Piru or VL's or GDs wit me we 
 Down to uprise from the OGs to peewees

 (Don't get it fucked up 
 If you ain't found something you're willing to die for, you ain't fit to live 
 To get something you've never had, you must be willing to do something you've never done 
 I'mma die by mine)

 Let me ask you something: if the kids are the future, tell me why you can get more for being C.O., than you can for being a teacher. Tell me why it means more to the government to pay the people who got to watch over the prisoners, more than the people who got to keep the children from becoming prisoners That make sense? Tell me why 9 ounces of crack will get you more time than a rape right now. Tell me why them crazy white boys can tote a gun but I can't right now. Yeah, I had felonies, I done did dirt in the streets, but I ain't ever gave it to anybody that didn't deserve it. You know what I mean? I ain't ever ran in no public place with no pistol shooting no innocent people. I ain't never ran in no school, killing no kids. Man this is the result of you refusing to deal with the issues at hand. We are a product of the environment you placed us in... we ain't do it... we just lived through it

 (Message to my people 
 Stop waiting on folk to help you, help yourself, it starts with you 
 Get yourself out, reach back, get somebody else out 
 And that's the way we 
 re going to get ahead 
 Sitting around waiting on government to do something for us ain't never gonna happen partner they don't give a fuck about us 
 But don't play into their hand partner, you making it easy for 'em, hell is you doing?)
