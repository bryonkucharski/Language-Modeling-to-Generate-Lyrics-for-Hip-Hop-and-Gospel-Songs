Hey, hey, hey, hey for as long as I remember, 
 I've been telling you all man to pull these nigga resumes. 
 You better check up on these nigga. these niggas be lying man. 
 These niggas ain't really kicking this shit they be telling you all man. 
 They wanna see you all get fucked up right there man. 
 Keep your eyes on me nigga don't believe what these niggas tell you man 
 (I'm tryna tell you partner) 
 You niggas ain't cool what they rap about 
 These niggas ain't do 
 Hear 'em say it but it really ain't true 
 You niggas ain't true 
 You niggas ain't really 
 Talking to 'em 
 Don't be no fool you better take you ass to school 
 'Cause these niggas ain't G's 
 Gangsta's something these niggas can't be 
 What you expect these niggas ain't me 
 You niggas ain't rich 
 You niggas ain't really getting bricks 
 It's official man you niggas ain't shit

 He nigga lying every time you hear rhyming 
 He don't talk about they diamonds 
 And how they be out there shining 
 For the wrap 
 Hey were trapping 
 Tell you all they be at there grinding 
 And I know they ain't about that action 
 I'm telling you I'm gonna ride 'em 
 They probably try to come in the hood and sell weed 
 Think it's all good until they run into some real G's 
 Holla tell us where it is 
 And I promise we'll leave 
 Hesitate to saying boy them lamma well squeeze 
 Please pay attention to this part of the bull 
 One time got robbed got shot got shooked 
 Got a job started rhyming came up with a hook 
 Got a chain and some tats came up with a look 
 Went and made it here 
 Working talk tough in a bull 
 Fuck the image and perception they never tough as they look 
 They some mother fucking suckers 
 Put it on wherever 
 Any real nigga know better man these niggas 
 You can't tell 
 Them niggas ain't surely 
 Get caught with a nigga gon' tell

 He ask you if it weigh enough just tell 'em Yeah 
 You nigga just yell 
 Pull the pistol them nigga gon bail 
 If he got a pistol bet he don't spray it 
 They don't wanna go to jail 
 And they ain't no hell be walking on shells 
 Gladiator school is you prepared

 All the way down and where your gold leg

 You just telling them you is as stead 
 You never bought us head 
 What you get behind the mic and just said 
 The people already know I must say it! 
 You damn right 
 These niggas don't have rights 
 To rap about the shit I did every night 
 Did you win every fight 
 You ever went to jail for selling white 
 May barbick and trap same night 
 Your know these niggas lame right 
 I'm speaking on it cause it ain't right 
 Nigga died I survived I done earned my stripe 
 Went to jail came home 
 Twenty times got it right 
 But still trying keep for shootin' sucker niggas I don't like 
 'Cause the game feel like the real niggas on strike 
 This sucker get a deal now he living so shy 
 You niggas outta sight acting hard lying on they record 
 Know it when you see recognize it don't respect it 
 Got every right to check 'em when you see 'em in your city 
 Run up on 'em and try 'em but you see that they some bitches 
 Niggas tell you what they want you to hear 
 Don't tell me real recognize real eventually they'll see 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey
