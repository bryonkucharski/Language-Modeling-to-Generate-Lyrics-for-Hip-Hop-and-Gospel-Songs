 I wear stripes row, my Louis, ho, Akoo matchin' my kicks, bitch 
 Papparazzi everywhere I go, I got cameras all in my bidne' 
 I rep the town, hold it down, cruise all around in my old school 
 My speaker loud and my reefer, too, I ain't speakin', bitch, do I know you? 
 Feds want me back behind that wall, that's the only place that I can't go 
 I'm focused, dog, and I ain't wit' that fuck shit, think it sweet but it ain't, doe 
 I'm tried and true when I'm ridin' through, I ain't hidin', they can just hate me 
 My top is down and my pockets fat and my diamonds clearer than HD

 A like this, don't wanna talk about Bankhead 
 Still in the trap like a goddamn brick, 'cause I love the hood, the king ain't dead 
 My hustle grand, my money long, my spot on top, bitch, I want that 
 My position vacant, my crown await me, my throne is empty, I own that 
 Folk in Kirkland, with a big hill, too, some'll head to Pittsburgh and all that 
 Real goons'll ride wit' me to Timbuktu, I ain't Gucci, dude, what you call that? 
 Mail the yell to East Point, and own that area, Vidalia, Sandal Hill all day

 Them so-called dope boys ain't sold enough 
 OGs ain't old enough 
 MCs ain't dope enough

 You so-so, I'm like dat 
 Tight work, bounce right back 
 Make room for yo' bitch, dog 
 Nigga, gon' get off my sack 
 That loud pack, I blow big 
 Always stunt so big 
 Please don't get wrong, homie 
 Or them G's gon' bust yo' wig 
 The ass is mine, no questions asked 
 The king is home, bitch, the best is back 
 My swagga turned 'em just like my sack 
 I'm flexin', shawty, who stoppin' that? 
 (T.I.) 
 Okay, man, you don't see what's in yo' face, big dog? 
 Yeah, man, big banks, no whammies, dog, you understand that?
