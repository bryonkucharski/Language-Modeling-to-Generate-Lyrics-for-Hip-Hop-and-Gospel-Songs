(Verse 1: T.I.) 
 Say girl 
 Ay, been holding on to you all night 
 So all my body feel wrong but it's all right 
 I know you probably thinking you don't even know me (I Know) 
 But girl the club in the close what it gon' be 
 I'm tryna tell you when your place hit the poppin' 
 808 get you droppin' [?] 
 So much temptation when her waist get the rockin' 
 And her eyes in a locket 
 Can't stop it girl I'm ready to die 
 I say I'm ready to die 
 (Chorus: Jazmine Sullivan) 
 So don't let go of me now 
 'Cause I'm dying in your arms tonight 
 Tell all my people around 
 That I'll see them in the after life 
 Cause something this big can't get that bad 
 So I really don't think again 
 Never ever come down 
 Your love has got me feelin' like 
 Imma die in your arms tonight 
 (You could be dying in the hands of a better man) 
 (So is you ready to die) 
 Imma die in your arms tonight (Girl is you ready to die) 
 (You could be dying in the hands of a better man) 
 (Girl is you ready to die) 
 (Hey is you ready to die) 
 (Verse 2: T.I.) 
 Hey living is over ratted 
 I see heaven when you make it 
 In your eyes in your thighs girl 
 I swear to god 
 I've been waitin' so I'm patient 
 Yeah, for you to take it off 
 Thoughts in my head are racing all day by chasing your waterfall 
 See time is of the essence 
 I got none to waste it all 
 Ain't that a lesson so childish games I don't play it all 
 My partner say I'm whip they be hatin' I know why 
 In your arms girl I'm ready to die 
 I say I'm ready to die 
 (Chorus: Jazmine Sullivan) 
 So don't let go of me now 
 'Cause I'm dying in your arms tonight 
 Tell all my people around 
 That I'll see them in the after life 
 Cause something this big can't get that bad 
 So I really don't think again 
 Never ever come down 
 Your love has got me feelin' like 
 Imma die in your arms tonight 
 This might be the last night that they see me 
 So tell everyone that I love 
 Got this mess through my heart completely 
 So I won't (I won't) 
 Be coming back (Come back) 
 'Cause I'm sprung 
 (Chorus: Jazmine Sullivan) 
 So don't let go of me now 
 'Cause I'm dying in your arms tonight 
 Tell all my people around 
 That I'll see them in the after life 
 Cause something this big can't get that bad 
 So I really don't think again 
 Never ever come down 
 Your love has got me feelin' like 
 So don't let go of me now 
 'Cause I'm dying in your arms tonight 
 Tell all my people around 
 That I'll see them in the after life 
 Cause something this big can't get that bad 
 So I really don't think again 
 Never ever come down 
 Your love has got me feelin' like 
 Imma die in your arms tonight 
 (You could be dying in the hands of a better man) 
 (So is you ready to die) 
 Imma die in your arms tonight (Girl is you ready to die) 
 (You could be dying in the hands of a better man) 
 (Girl is you ready to die) 
 Imma die in your arms tonight (Girl is you ready to die) 
 (You could be dying in the hands of a better man) 
 (Girl is you ready to die) 
 Imma die in your arms tonight (Girl is you ready to die) 
 (You could be dying in the hands of a better man) 
 (Girl is you ready to die) 
 (Hey is you ready to die)
