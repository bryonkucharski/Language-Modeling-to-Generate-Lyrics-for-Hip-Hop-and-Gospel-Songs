I'm the truth, tell it, loud weed yellin' 
 Get it by the pound, we just smoke it, we don't sell it 
 What I blow'll make a plane go 
 Them bitches say "You got some money but you lame" 
 We blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass 
 We blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass 
 We blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass 
 We blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass 
 Man you so lame, just lookin' at you, nigga 
 While I'm in here no bitch'll give her pussy to you, nigga, no 
 She say "Not even with a bank roll" 
 Cause the king gettin' money when the bank's closed 
 Yeah, she in her heels on her knees though 
 Yeah, her nigga call, she don't leave though 
 Nope, I beat that pussy like she stole somethin' 
 Then tell that ho get up and roll somethin' 
 We pourin' up, blowin' gas, weed noisy 
 She on that molly, won't stop talkin' and annoyin' me 
 I'm like, "Why don't you suck a nigga's dick or somethin'?" 
 Or take it from behind while you eat a bitch or somethin' 
 I like my bitches doubled up like my white cup 
 I like my pint sealed up, drank poured up 
 Yup, and you know you don't wanna catch it 
 You don't wanna see my niggas actin' ratchet with the ratchet 
 I'm the truth, tell it, loud weed yellin' 
 Get it by the pound, we just smoke it, we don't sell it 
 What I blow'll make a plane go 
 Them bitches say "You got some money but you lame" 
 We blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass 
 We blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass 
 We blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass 
 We blow, jet fuel, plane gas on your lame ass 
 Lil Boosie: 
 I'm a jet fuel smoker, crazy like the Joker 
 Suck it 'fore you fuck it is exactly what I told her 
 Ten bottles, two models, kush sack, it's a jet ride 
 Go and get my game stash, bitch, off the west side 
 Baby daddy face lookin' long, better change that 
 Make a nigga drop some change on your lame ass 
 Bob Marley smoke, spendin' hundred after hundred 
 Jumped down her throat and in her stomach, now she runnin' 
 Me and my henchmen, we be gunnin' for the money, blowin' jet fuel 
 We don't pay for pussy 'cause we fuck more than we rest, dude 
 I bet you that your main bitch'll bless boo 
 And every ho with her when they see me gon' break their neck too 
 Rich dick in her, I done gave the bitch life support 
 High in the pussy same way that I was high in court 
 Flip it, slap it, rub it down, finish, give it back up 
 Wash the dick off while she roll the kush sack up 
 I'm the truth, tell it, loud weed yellin' 
 Get it by the pound, we just smoke it, we don't sell it 
 What I blow'll make a plane go 
 Them bitches say "You got some money but you lame"

 Better kush if them bitches wanna blow, of the blow 
 For the hoes who be playin' with their nose, now you know 
 That the king all about the dollar bills, quarter mil' 
 In the bag, slappin' bitches on their ass with dollar bills 
 You don't like it, ho? You ain't gotta chill then 
 Leave the laughin' match and go back to where you live then 
 Nope, but you don't wanna do that 
 How this ho blowin' on me, where her trumpet or her flute at? 
 I brought a pound and she blew that, see he brought two back 
 Drunk up a pint of lean, ain't sleepin', now who can do that? 
 She dippin' all that molly, steady askin' where the food at 
 You don't believe me? Ask my nigga Jeezy, he can true that 
 I beat that pussy, blew that, man I ain't gon' finesse it 
 Man you know what I'm smokin', shawty you ain't gotta check it 
 You can smell it, this shit I'm smokin' straight up out of D4 
 I ain't talkin' but it's loud when the weed blow 
 Yup, like I'm fresh up on the runway 
 Wheels up, weed loud like gunplay 
 On them sucka niggas with their lame ass 
 You bustas blowin' train smoke, we blowin' gas 
 I'm the truth, tell it, loud weed yellin' 
 Get it by the pound, we just smoke it, we don't sell it

 What you mean, why should you? I think a more appropriate question would be why not. 
 I mean, look around you, exceptions to circumstances require exceptions to be made. 
 Would you not consider this exceptional? Any sane woman would. 
 But it's not so much who I am as what I am - a stand up guy, man of respect. 
 This life of value, you can't just go purchase and put it on, baby. 
 Anybody say they can, they just puttin' on. 
 Aye, you need to check their certification. I keep my paperwork
