Search far and wide and I bet you'll never find a lil' nigga with a heart this size. Keep me separate and apart from all these frauds. They see me get appalled, you know why? 
 Victoria Monet:

 T.I.: 
 Every time I take, penitentiary chance all I take 
 God with me I'm a find my way 
 Nigga they ain't even fuck around nowaday 
 Feds came in the house, say they found my yay 
 A couple handguns and a new SK 
 Bag full of weed and some gram of yay 
 But fuck it though I gotta keep my grandma straight 
 Catch a case, getaway by the grace of God 
 Standing on the corner slanging slabs of hard 
 Just a young soldier no camouflage 
 Man them niggas ain't tough they're just playing hard 
 I pull a fuck nigga card on GP 
 Between 'em make 11 mill and peewee 
 We spray your block, turn around pull and repeat 
 And let everybody look at it on TV 
 I'm certified I'm gangster, getting on the rock like my banker 
 I'm in the gated mansion, no neighbor 
 New Italian suits on my hangers 
 I got Cuban links and diamond rings 
 Solitaries of shiny things 
 Aye fuck how tough you tryin' to seem 
 Come try the king, 'cause I'm about my

 Have you ever heard? The point blank blast of a Mossberg 
 Whole block never mind, look you've not heard 
 Lil' nigga keep it moving like they not scared 
 And I hear it, they do or die 
 Kill after kill in the coupe so fly 
 Man the niggas over there tried to shoot your guy 
 Man the fully automatic.22 go by like damn 
 And they fly as I am, it's hard for you to tell how high I am 
 Oh my God damn, you see it don't believe it still 
 And all I ever had was a Glock 23 and an extra mag 
 Presidential weed and a extra bag 
 2 or 3 bad bitches I'm a get the friend 
 We set to land and I'm a get the plan 
 How to violate your little sexy ass 
 Then get in the Jag 
 Just ride this till you get to splash 
 You a wild girl, go cowgirl 
 Keep the noise down, you loud girl 
 Turn down, don't know how girl 
 No white girl cause

 Nipsey Hu$$le: 
 Couldn't listen to niggas they said I dream too much 
 Heart fucked up, guess I sing too much 
 Numb to it now, bring a gun to it now 
 When this shit pop I'm a run to it now 
 Niggas talk loud but they dumb to announce 
 Read he got away so he tryna play it down 
 When they kick down your door and they run through your house 
 Cuffs on your wrists and they cussin' you out 
 It'll make sense then, telling you that they got your prints then 
 What's the reward for your risk then? 
 Niggas game goofy, this just in 
 Time after time, know we need a light nigga blind lead the blind 
 Why do we ride? Grind to provide nigga not just to shine 
 Blood in my eyes, stress on my mind let a fly nigga fly 
 9 on my side, God I'm your child but times are so wild 
 Playing with me? I'm a draw down and I'm a show out 
 If it gotta go down, I'm prepared to go now cause
