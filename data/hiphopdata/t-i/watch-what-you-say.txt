 Watch what you say to me 
 You better watch what you say to me 
 Watch what you say to me 
 You say, I spray, hey 
 Watch what you say to me 
 You see me, you know I'm two'd up 
 You don't wanna see me cut the full grip 
 Well, watch what you say to me 
 Let me find out you talkin' tough in your song 
 When you see me you know what's up, boy, it's on 
 Nigga, what you say to me 
 You see 'cause I ain't been a fuck, nigga, never 
 I'm just warnin' all you, sucka niggas 
 Better watch what you say to me 
 'Cause I'm known to make a mountain outta molehill 
 You don't want to get your folk killed 
 Well, watch what you say to me 
 Got a tool in my pocket and the club just rock 
 Watchin' these niggas while your girlfriend jockin' 
 They better let it go because niggas already know 
 That I got that thang with me and it ain't just to let it go 
 I'm tryin' to mind my [Incomprehensible] till I hit it, niggas, say yo 
 They ain't nobody fuck 'em, I'm thinkin' I'm finna bust 'em, wait 
 Look up and see the police is lookin' at me 
 I tell C, he tell Doug, they tell KT 
 We proceed to surround 'em and call the [Incomprehensible] 
 Pick the perfect spot to make sure that the girls see 
 Was watchin' off for doin' the drink, he say what? What you think 
 Then he call, from then on you can see nothin' but bottles 
 Remy Martin to the noggin, better bust it wide open 
 Ya bitch standin' here hollerin' while you lyin' on the floor, shit 
 Why you feelin' sorry for him? He asked for it 
 Listen, y'all, here come the moral of the story 
 Watch what you say to me 
 You see me, you know I'm two'd up 
 You don't wanna see me cut the full grip 
 Well, watch what you say to me 
 Let me find out you talkin' tough in your song 
 When you see me you know what's up, boy, it's on 
 Nigga, what you say to me 
 You see 'cause I ain't been a fuck, nigga, never 
 I'm just warnin' all you, sucka niggas 
 Better watch what you say to me 
 'Cause I'm known to make a mountain outta molehill 
 You don't want to get your folk killed 
 Well, watch what you say to me 
 Rap music is sudden ain't it, the way these pictures is painted 
 You swear these niggas is dangerous, the gangsta shit they be sayin' 
 Lock 'em up in the booth with a half a ounce of that Cannibus 
 Sittin' back and watch the Outlandish shit they betrayin' but 
 Soon as you see 'em they freeze up like in museums 
 Them statues you like, is that the dude who said he was gonna pop? 
 Niggas, get runnin' before you finish your sentence 
 And then they back to riffin' when they off in a safe distance 
 You, like you was just here, you disappeared like magicians in thin air 
 I'm like damn, nigga, at least keep it consistent 
 I hear you debatin' me lately, I've been doin' my best to stay hater free 
 Still watch what you say to me 
 Sooner or later I'll take you up on your offer 
 And put you all in your place like I'm replacing your father 
 You talkin' to the author, the architect of the blueprint 
 My DNA in your music, mothafucker, are you stupid? 
 Watch what you say to me 
 You see me, you know I'm two'd up 
 You don't wanna see me cut the full grip 
 Well, watch what you say to me 
 Let me find out you talkin' tough in your song 
 When you see me you know what's up, boy, it's on 
 Nigga, what you say to me 
 You see 'cause I ain't been a fuck, nigga, never 
 I'm just warnin' all you, sucka niggas 
 Better watch what you say to me 
 'Cause I'm known to make a mountain outta molehill 
 You don't want to get your folk killed 
 Well, watch what you say to me 
 'Cause I ain't never been a sucka, been gangsta my whole life 
 So a nigga disrespect me and it's on on sight 
 I hear what you say in your songs, some of it I don't like 
 Heat it up, I feel tried, I see you, we gon' fight 
 Be a man, say my name if you talkin' to me 
 You never said, well, I figured you ain't talkin' to me 
 Find out you is at the awards, well, I'll call you out in the street 
 I swear I'll beat your fuckin' ass like it ought to be beat 
 See all that whisperin' is lame, I ain't one for the game 
 If I say, fuck you then it's fuck you, nigga, simple and plain 
 I say, no problem, it's no problem, pimp then you do the same 
 Now you can just swallow your pride 'cause you know I'm off the chain 
 Try to refrain from bein' violent but you come out your face 
 I got my lawyer paid already to catch me a case 
 When I feel you disrespected me I'ma get me a case 
 But all this shit can be avoided one way 
 Watch what you say to me 
 You see me, you know I'm two'd up 
 You don't wanna see me cut the full grip 
 Well, watch what you say to me 
 Let me find out you talkin' tough in your song 
 When you see me you know what's up, boy, it's on 
 Nigga, what you say to me 
 You see 'cause I ain't been a fuck, nigga, never 
 I'm just warnin' all you, sucka niggas 
 Better watch what you say to me 
 'Cause I'm known to make a mountain outta molehill 
 You don't want to get your folk killed 
 Well, watch what you say to me
