(Ay, who I be?) 
 Rubber band man wild as the Taliban 
 9 in my right 45 in my other hand 
 (Who I'm is?) 
 Call me trouble man always in trouble man 
 Worth a couple hundred grand chevys, all colors man 
 Rubber band man like a one man band 
 Treat these niggas like the Apollo and I'm the sandman 
 Tote a hundred grand Canon in the waistband 
 Looking for a sweet lick? Well this is the wrong place man 
 Seven time felon, what I care about a case man? 
 I'm campaigning to bury the hate, so say ya grace man 
 Ay, I don't talk behind a nigga back I say it in his face 
 I'm a thoroughbred nigga, I don't fake and I don't hate 
 Check my resume nigga my record's impeccable 
 Anywhere in the a nigga how TIP is highly respectable 
 And the MIA nigga I'm tryna keep it professional 
 'Cause all this tongue rastling finna have me snappin', I'm telling you 
 From the bottom of tha Duval, Cakalacky to New York 
 And everybody showing me love that's one to you all 
 Yeah, to all my Florida niggas, my Cakalacky niggas 
 My LA niggas 
 (Ay, who I be?) 
 Rubber band man wild as the Taliban 
 9 in my right 45 in my other hand 
 (Who I'm is?) 
 Call me trouble man always in trouble man 
 Worth a couple hundred grand chevys, all colors man 
 (Ay, who I be?) 
 Rubber band man wild as the Taliban 
 9 in my right 45 in my other hand 
 (Who I'm is?) 
 Call me trouble man always in trouble man 
 Worth a couple hundred grand chevys, all colors man 
 Call me trouble man stayed in some trouble man 
 Some niggas still hating on shawty so they some suckas man 
 Got a couple fans that love to do nothing other than 
 Lick, suck, show no respect but still I love 'em man 
 Dig it, Lil' Pimpin' got the mind and the muscle 
 Stay down on his grind put the crown on the hustle 
 Ay, I could show ya how to juggle anything and make it double 
 Weed, blow, real estate, liquor sto wit no trouble 
 Young cats is playin' today Marvin Gaye of my time 
 Tryna stay alive livin' how I say in my rhymes 
 My cousin used to tell me take this shit a day at a time 
 And told me Friday, died Sunday we a day in the ground 
 I still smile 'cause somehow I know he seeing me now 
 And so I'm doing all my shows
