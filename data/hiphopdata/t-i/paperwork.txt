 Don't do no business until you check his (paperwork) 
 And if all else fails, I just hope that this (paperwork) 
 Wanna swing Bentley doors, blow smoke through the roof 
 Everything got a cost, they gone need something on you

 ATL, Westside, that's the only home I know 
 In '85, me and Uncle Quint used to ride around in the big Bronco 
 Took me up to Charles' Disco 
 Daytime, set me down at the bar 
 Where I drank Shirley Temple 
 Till he walked out with a bag and we got back in the car 
 What you wanna be he asked? When you grow up big kid? 
 I just wanna be like you, ridin' round town gettin' bread 
 We shot a couple Lac, couple summer pass 
 Uncle Quint ain't nowhere to be found 
 Later we learn that someone ratted him out 
 For that reason 10 years he won't be around

 Picture me in '93 
 I'm the only man I see 
 Fresh up off the porch 
 Lookin' for a drop Porsche and a fake ID 
 Introduce me to the crack game 
 Rap game was the furthest from my mind 
 Had a notebook full of rhymes 
 And a pocket full of crack rock dimes 
 Time on my side, lift.45 in my jeans 
 Open fire if you seem to be blocking my dreams, yessir 
 Welfare, food stamps 
 Section eight, me and Ma lived in the trap 
 I said fuck school, it holdin' me back 
 I wanna bankroll, chasin' after that

 Look at me, at 17 
 Livin' on my own, peddlin' 
 Quarter ki, now and then sellin' weed 
 Tokin' too, cost my first felony 
 That's one of many, that were to follow 
 Drinkin' Henney up out the bottle 
 Told a child I think I'm bein' followed 
 Family don't think I'll live to see tomorrow 
 Plenty have a story like mine 
 Know many of you had a little nine 
 Know many of you did a little dirt 
 Too many of us did a little time 
 Wake up, 10 years of your life passed 
 When you get your cake up 
 Don't it seem like that 
 When the Feds on your ass passin' out

 Pharrell (T.I.): 
 If you think that you high, baby look above you 
 It's drones in the sky, there's nothing you could do 
 So left, two, three snap 
 Right two, three snap 
 Don't get serious now it's too late for that 
 'Cause they got 
 Time on my side, lift.45 in my jean 
 Open fire if you seem to be blocking my dreams, yessir
