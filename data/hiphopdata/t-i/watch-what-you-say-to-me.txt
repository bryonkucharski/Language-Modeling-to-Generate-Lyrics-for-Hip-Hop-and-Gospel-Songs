Ay, Ay, Ay 
 Watch what you say to me 
 You better watch what you say to me 
 Watch what you say to me 
 You say, I'll spray. 
 Watch what you say to me 
 You see me and ya know I'm tooled up 
 You don't wanna see me cut the fool bruh 
 Watch what you say to me 
 Let me find out you talkin' tough in your song 
 When you see me you know what's up boy, it's on. 
 Nigga, what you say to me? 
 Cause see I ain't been a fuck nigga never 
 I'm just warning all you sucker niggas 
 Better watch what you say to me 
 'Cause I'm known to make a mountain outta mole hole 
 You don't wanna get ya folks killed... 
 Watch what you say to me. 
 (1st verse: T.I.) 
 Got a tool in my pocket and the club just rockin' 
 Watching ey' nigga while they girlfriend jocking 
 They gotta let it go because niggas already know 
 I got that thing with me and anxious to let it go 
 I'm trying to mind my business though, tell I hear this nigga say yo 
 "They ain't nobody, fuck em" I'm thinking I'm fitting to buss em 
 Wait, look up and see these polices is lookin' at me 
 I tell C, he tell Doug, they tell Jay-Z 
 We proceed to surround 'em and call a squirrel meeting 
 Pick a perfect spot and make sure that they girl see 
 My man offered dude a drink, he said "what? wuchu think?" 
 Then call from then on all you couldn't see nothin' but bottles 
 Remy Martin to the noggin, bet it bust it wide open 
 His bitch standing there hollering while he lying on the floor, shit 
 Why you feeling sorry for him? He asked for it 
 Listen y'all, here come the moral of the story. 
 Watch what you say to me 
 You see me and ya know I'm tooled up 
 You don't wanna see me cut the fool bruh 
 Watch what you say to me 
 Let me find out you talkin' tough in your song 
 When you see me you know what's up boy, it's on. 
 Nigga, what you say to me? 
 Cause see I ain't been a fuck nigga never 
 I'm just warning all you sucker niggas 
 Better watch what you say to me 
 'Cause I'm known to make a mountain outta mole hole 
 You don't wanna get ya folks killed... 
 Watch what you say to me. 
 (2nd verse: Jay-Z) 
 Rap music is something ain't it? The way these pictures is painted 
 You swear these niggas is dangerous, the gangsta shit they be saying 
 Lock 'em up in the booth with a half ounce of that cannabis 
 Sit back, and watch the outlandish shit they portraying 
 But, soon as you see 'em they freeze up like in museums 
 Them statues, you like, "Is that the dude, that said he was gonna..."(puuhn) 
 Niggas get running before you finish ya sentence 
 And then they back to riffing, when they off at the safe distance 
 You like, you was just here, you disappear like magicians 
 In thin air, I'm like "Damn, nigga at least keep it consistent" 
 I hear you baiting me lately, I been doing my best just to stay hater free 
 Still watch what you say to me 
 Sooner or later I take you up on your offer 
 And put you all in ya place like I'm replacing ya father 
 You talking, to the author, the architect of The Blueprint 
 My DNA in your music, muthafucker you stupid? 
 Watch what you say to me 
 You see me and ya know I'm tooled up 
 You don't wanna see me cut the fool bruh 
 Watch what you say to me 
 Let me find out you talkin' tough in your song 
 When you see me you know what's up boy, it's on. 
 Nigga, what you say to me? 
 Cause see I ain't been a fuck nigga never 
 I'm just warning all you sucker niggas 
 Better watch what you say to me 
 'Cause I'm known to make a mountain outta mole hole 
 You don't wanna get ya folks killed... 
 Watch what you say to me. 
 (3rd verse: T.I.) 
 'Cause I ain't never been a sucker, been gangsta my whole life 
 So a nigga disrespect me and it's on on sight 
 I hear what you say in your song, some of that I don't like 
 Keep it up, I feel tried, I see you, we gon' fight 
 Be a man, say my name if you talking to me 
 You never say it, well I figure you ain't talking to me 
 Find out you is at the awards or whether caught in the streets 
 I swear I beat ya fuckin' ass like it ought to be beat 
 See all that whispering lame, I ain't one for the game 
 If I say fuck you nigga then, fuck you nigga, simple and plain 
 I say no problem, there's no problem, pimping you do the same 
 Now you just, swallow ya pride 'cause you know I'm off the chain 
 Try to refrain from being violent but you come out ya face 
 I got my lawyer paid up ready to catch me a case 
 When I feel you disrespected me, I'm a get me a K 
 But all this shit can be avoided one way... 
 Watch what you say to me 
 You see me and ya know I'm tooled up 
 You don't wanna see me cut the fool bruh 
 Watch what you say to me 
 Let me find out you talkin' tough in your song 
 When you see me you know what's up boy, it's on. 
 Nigga, what you say to me? 
 Cause see I ain't been a fuck nigga never 
 I'm just warning all you sucker niggas 
 Better watch what you say to me 
 'Cause I'm known to make a mountain outta mole hole 
 You don't wanna get ya folks killed... 
 Watch what you say to me.
