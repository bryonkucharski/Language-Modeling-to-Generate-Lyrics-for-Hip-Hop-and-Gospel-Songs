Swizzy, need y'all to take y'all rags out, man, T.I 
 And let it swang, swang, swang, swang 
 Let it swang, swang, swang, swang 
 All right, okay, I don't dance, no way 
 I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air 
 Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air 
 All right, okay, I don't dance, no way 
 I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air 
 Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air

 New Akoo outfit with a Gucci rag 
 Tied to my belt loop and my Louis bag 
 Full of stacks rubber bands round big cash 
 Got a sick swag tell the haters get mad, come on 
 We in the club homes getting' our thug on 
 Bottles of Patron if you grown get your buzz on 
 We brought the broads out and brought the cars out 
 I'm like the moon I shine and bring the stars out 
 When it dark out, get the squad out 
 We ball hard sucka nigga eat your heart out 
 I'm too advanced super swag in my Louis pants 
 Ballin' on my Louis silk shirt match my Louis rag 
 All right, okay, I don't dance, no way 
 I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air 
 Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air 
 All right, okay, I don't dance, no way 
 I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air 
 Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air 
 Swang 
 I say, whoa kimosabe, big ballin' is my hobby 
 I'm boppin' while I'm walkin', rag fallin' out my pocket 
 If big money ain't the topic, homie, I ain't even talkin' 
 Hated on by the workers but I'm cool with all the bosses 
 Catch me flossin' at the mall, talkin' to a broad 
 She follow me in Gucci and I taught her how to ball 
 Three pair of shoes, four shirts, six rags 
 The chick said, dag, that's more than my bag 
 Shawty, I can show you how to spend this bread real fast 
 Then get a group of chicks to give you head real fast 
 Silk scarf hangin' out of my jeans 
 Naw homie, I ain't thinking, I'm just doin', my thing 
 All right, okay, I don't dance, no way 
 I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air 
 Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air 
 All right, okay, I don't dance, no way 
 I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air 
 Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air 
 Swang 
 I took some time off, and now I'm back y'all 
 You in the line at the club, I'm in the back, dawg 
 And when this song on, ballers peel stacks off 
 And make it rain on them broads, watch them stacks fall 
 And pull your rag out and wave it left, right 
 Let it sag with ya pants, get ya swag just right 
 Ride Bankhead flare flyin' out the Benz 
 Once a fool with it we 'gon bring 'em out again 
 All right, okay, I don't dance, no way 
 I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air 
 Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air 
 All right, okay, I don't dance, no way 
 I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air 
 Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air
