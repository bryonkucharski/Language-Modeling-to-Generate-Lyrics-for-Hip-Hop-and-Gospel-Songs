Hey it dawned on me and 
 I see the big picture I know 
 On everything I love I'm the shit and I know 
 To do it big I gotta keep 'em out my business I know 
 Because these niggas like to gossip like the bitches I know 
 I finally get it now 
 I see the big picture I know 
 On everything I love I'm the shit and I know 
 I run this city, wish that wasn't my position I know 
 These niggas softer than the pussies and the bitches I know 
 Aye 
 What it is big dog? I know I'm the shit 'cause I bounce back 
 Totally recover from a pit fall 
 Don't make you a fighter just because you got your fist balled 
 Its get right and get paid or good night and get lost 
 Bitches talk big shit even when my dick soft 
 Everyday my birthday, they just wanna get they licks off 
 Rocket ship lift off, come sit on my launch pad 
 G5, mile high, group sex, jet lag 
 Boullion, checks, cash, millions, just ask 
 Even if you hate me, surely you respect that 
 Yeah, you're now rockin' with the best dad 
 Chicks see me I be like "look at T.I. with his zig-zags" 
 Wishin they could take a ride on my moustache 
 Or maybe see the inside of my plush pad 
 But I must pass, I know what you on homie 
 Up late one night early morning and hey, it dawned on me and 
 Love my mutha fuckin' life 
 I'm so mutha fuckin' tight 
 They say "he think he the shit" 
 I say "you mutha fuckin' right" 
 Teach a mutha fuckin' dyke to learn to love suckin pipe 
 Buses, cars, trucks and bikes in my yard 
 Up the price of my performance 
 Now I'm goin' for a half a mil' a night 
 Quarter million just to party 
 If you gossip get it right 
 Niggas shiest 
 But I know somethin' if I put end a nigga life 
 It's gonna begin a nigga trip to god and end a nigga life 
 Man I keep it one hundred, one thousand to be precise 
 If you round me frontin go find a mountain and take a hike 
 Yeah I know you set your sights on me, tryin' to get stripes 
 Homie look smaller but feel bigger in real life, don't he? 
 I'm all that and more, ain't nothin' 'bout the hype for me 
 I'm sharing life moments, ain't nobody write for me 
 You a one trick pony, I'm quadruple threat homie 
 Up late 4 in the mornin and hey, it dawned on me and 
 I'm clearly somethin' special, officially I'm the best who 
 Did it in my city and even in the U.S, you 
 Must agree, they can't fuck with me, I'ma beast unless you, 
 Hatin', you ain't gotta be sneezin for me to bless you 
 If the records don't get you, I bet the movie will get you 
 ??...Will catch your attention, I'ma impress you 
 With swagger long term, Hollywood bitches to tag along 
 Groupies just imagine on, they know what I'm braggin on 
 I gotta message you can pass along, tell a friend 
 We getting long paper jay, we made it back from hell again 
 Knockin' on heaven's door, residing there forever more 
 Promoters, this worth every cent, you couldn't buy a better tour 
 And you are forced to admire the messiah 
 Expressin your desire, you're just preachin to the choir 
 The nation has it wired to hear your majesty, sire 
 I'm flyin high up one mornin and hey, it dawned on me and
