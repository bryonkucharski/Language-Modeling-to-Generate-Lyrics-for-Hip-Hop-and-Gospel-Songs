I'm a rich nigga like I don't know 
 I can change if I wanna, but I won't though 
 Steer right even when I'm on the wrong road 
 Real talk from the heart what I'm known for 
 Skinny jeans, I don't do those 
 I'm the starter sub-par oughta shoot for 
 Fully automatic chopper, you could shoot though 
 Now I'm movin' five mil' when I shoot dough 
 Audemar, Hublot 
 One point five on the two-do' 
 Old hustle, new flow 
 Old money, new ho 
 Suckers prayin' I'm a chill, but I'm too cold 
 Long as I'm around, fuck they need you for? 
 Ridin' in the Chevy totin' three bricks 
 Since nobody wanna make G shit 
 Watch The Duck: 
 This is for the gangsters, for the pimps and hoes 
 This is for the dopeboy trappers sellin' halves and hoes 
 (Since nobody wanna make G shit) 
 They want G shit, give it to 'em 
 They want G shit, give it to 'em 
 I'm the one to give it to 'em 
 If you don't know me let me tell you somethin', shawty 
 Still got them choppers, make you run from it 
 Camouflage, dog tag 
 Got 'em followin', when you see me better haul ass 
 Keep it G at all costs, what you call that? 
 Crack rock, hip hop, I done all that 
 Certified trap nigga, sucker, fall back 
 A broke nigga he may entertain all that 
 All left field, keep it true, nigga 
 Save the flash in the dance for a new nigga 
 Keep speakin' for the ones who ain't got a voice 
 Kill 'em dead only when they leave no other choice 
 How I see it, if you ain't down to die 'bout it 
 Don't write my time, slime, why the fuck we talking about it? 
 Still ridin' in the Chevy totin' three bricks 
 Since nobody wanna make G shit 
 Watch The Duck: 
 This is for the gangsters, for the pimps and hoes 
 This is for the dopeboy trappers sellin' halves and hoes 
 (Since nobody wanna make G shit) 
 They want G shit, give it to 'em 
 They want G shit, give it to 'em 
 I'm the one to give it to 'em 
 Jeezy: 
 Now what the fuck is an ounce? We smokin' bout an LB 
 We don't even do the nine, sell it by the whole ki 
 And I'm a take this shit to trial, they got nothin' on me 
 They be on the Champagne, bitch, I'm 'bout to OD 
 Got a bag full of birds and motherfuckers gettin' robbed 
 Bars on the trap doors got it looking like a vault 
 Used to hit the highway over twenty of them things 
 Young nigga hit the club with the twenty unchanged 
 When Jay was beefin' with Nas I was sellin' cocaine 
 When Game was beefin' with 50 I was doin' the same thing 
 I was at the hospital, nigga, Meechy got shot 
 Fuck you niggas talking 'bout? I love that nigga like Pac 
 Watch The Duck: 
 This is for the gangsters, for the pimps and hoes 
 This is for the dopeboy trappers sellin' halves and hoes 
 (Since nobody wanna make G shit) 
 They want G shit, give it to 'em 
 They want G shit, give it to 'em 
 I'm the one to give it to 'em
