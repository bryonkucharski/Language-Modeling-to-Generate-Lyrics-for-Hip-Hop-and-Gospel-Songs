Tell the DJ turn it up 
 Bet the DJ bring it back 
 Tell him play that shit again 
 Tell him that you like that, like that, oh! 
 (Trey, I ain't got but 2 reasons to be here man) 
 All the ballers poppin' bottles 
 I know it's somebody birthday 
 Right now, right now, right now, right now, right now 
 Yeah and somebody gettin' drunk too 
 Right now, right now, right now, right now, right now 
 Catch me in the club like I own that bitch 
 Shawty dancing like she own that dick 
 Bad bitches never hold back 
 Send me a picture, where your phone at? 
 I only came here for 2 reasons 
 I came for (Whatchu came for?) 
 I only came for the bitches and the drinks 
 Bitches and the drinks 
 Bitches and the drinks 
 For the bitch, ca-came for the bitches and the drinks 
 Bitches and the drinks 
 Bitches and the drinks (What you came for?) 
 Baby get your glass up 
 Only came for bitches and the drinks 
 Baby get your ass up 
 That's what I came for 
 I see you tryin' to handcuff her on the street 
 Stop trippin' you can't control that freak 
 Ain't nobody got a body like hers 
 Ghetto booty, but she came from the burbs 
 Got a dark skinned girl dancin' on me 
 Two white girls dancin' on me 
 Bad yellow bone, yeah I'm in my zone 
 Waitress keep comin' back, so you know we hella gone 
 I hit the club and buy the bar 
 In VIP just see my partners and a lot of broads 
 And such a GIP jam bottle poppin', party hard 
 I'm done with today, I'm lookin' for tomorrow 
 All I do is turn up, ain't no dough it don't concern us 
 All this bubble kush I burn up, special, regular, reward us 
 Turn the corners fishtailin' out the parking lot yellin' 
 Bankhead! West side! Eight or nine chicks trailin' 
 Right behind us, been this way since we were minors 
 If it wasn't for the chicks up in this bitch you wouldn't find us 
 Even way out in China, same thing when I came through the door 
 Like, here you go again (where the bitches and the drink, yo) 
 I only came for the bitches and the drinks 
 Bitches and the drinks 
 Bitches and the drinks (You need to know what I came for) 
 Bitches and the drinks 
 Bitches and the drinks 
 Bitches and the drinks (You know know what I came for) 
 Baby get your glass up 
 Only came for bitches and the drinks 
 Baby get your ass up 
 That's what I came for 
 Hey girl you heard what I said, get your ass up 
 If you hot, you cold, you Florida, Alaska 
 Chicago, Virginia, New York City 
 Houston where the girls all thick 
 LA, the Bay, tell your girl 'bout this 
 Matter fact tell the whole GA 
 Ooh, you know they fine up and down the Carolinas 
 Shout to every ten I see when I'm down in Tennessee 
 I only came here for 2 reasons 
 I came for (Whatchu came for?) 
 I only came for the bitches and the drinks
