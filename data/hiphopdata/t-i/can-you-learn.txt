Eh 
 I got a question for the ladies out there, yeah 
 Cause there's a few things that I would like to know 
 Before I fuck with you 
 Oh baby 
 Could you learn? 
 Could you learn to love a troubled man? Yeah eh 
 Oh baby 
 Could you learn? 
 Could you learn to love a troubled man? Yeah 
 You sure you wanna roll with me? I'm a complicated man 
 Live my life close to the edge, it ain't even safe to stand 
 Trouble Man, always into something 
 Numb to the consequences, guess it's coming if it's coming 
 But so much shit they say that I can't do because I'm famous 
 Guess I should live in a bubble like these other entertainers 
 The danger's so enticing to me, I don't even notice it 
 Guess I get away or get arrested 'fore it's over with 
 Prison sentence every year, got everybody after me 
 Reaper on my heels, I'm just praying he don't catch a G 
 Imagine me and you, somewhere happy with a few hundred mills 
 Sill I could go to jail for some years 
 'Cause I push it to the limit, the danger's so exciting 
 I'm loving every minute, girl this life ain't nothing like it 
 And you only live once so as long as I'm alive 
 I be living on the edge, shorty sure you wanna ride? 
 Oh baby 
 Could you learn? 
 Could you learn to love a troubled man? Yeah eh 
 Oh baby 
 Could you learn? 
 Could you learn to love a troubled man? Yeah 
 Ay ay ay 
 Aye, they say if the drugs ain't the death of me, the lifestyle will be 
 Law keep arresting me, sucka wanna kill me 
 Still we in the fast lane, grind break, next speed 
 A million dollar sports car, smoking on the best weed 
 Fist fights in night clubs for rap beefs 
 Shootings, retaliations, yes that deed 
 I guess they just got to catch me when they catch me 
 Because I'm putting it in they life if they attempt to disrespect me 
 Especially when I know they say what go around come around 
 That's why when we go around I keep a gun around 
 Cause bullshit, there be none around here 
 But I got a secret though, I wanna change - I swear 
 But suckas won't let me and feds still sweat me 
 So I'm looking for the worst to have you praying for the best 
 Think you can help me if they get me? Could you handle shit for me? 
 Think about it, is your body sure the answer assuming me 
 Oh baby 
 Could you learn? 
 Could you learn to love a troubled man? Yeah eh 
 Oh baby 
 Could you learn? 
 Could you learn to love a troubled man? Yeah 
 Girl would you give me your number? (tell the truth) 
 If I had an ok car, not much money 
 9 to 5, with a future on me oh 
 Tell me would you ever fuck with a brother like me? (would you?) 
 If I did time in my life, time in my life 
 Time in my life, time in my life 
 Tell me could you give your sex to me? (I really wanna know) 
 If I was fightin in the club, fightin in the club 
 Fightin in the club, fightin in the club 
 Hey baby! 
 Could you learn? (put your hands up) 
 Learn to love a troubled man 
 (If you got a drink I need you to put that in the air as well, ok?) 
 Hey baby 
 Could you learn? 
 Could you learn to love a troubled man? Yeah eh
