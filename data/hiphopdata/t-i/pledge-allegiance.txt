Ay count that money for me partner 
 Ay Ross make sure that nigga got that shit right, ya hear me? 
 Ay, let a motherfucker go ding, that's a 150 thou 
 Yeah, that shit should add up to about 5.4 
 I be right back, I'm finna go get dressed 
 Tell tha nigga to gas up tha jet 
 I stay on my grind cause that come first 
 If he get outta line his feelings finna get hurt 
 All that's on my mind is get that dough 
 He try me imma take you places you don't wanna go 
 56 stacks of more and I'm in your town 
 Just to shake some booty home but it finna go down 
 Hear that click clack roll, better get back fast 
 Have attention when you see me pledge allegiance to the swag 
 Pledge allegiance to the swag 
 Ay, I do my thang you don't know 
 Off the motherfuckin' chain, play the game how it go 
 I ain't in the game still imma problem on the low 
 Whip them thangs well just know I know who got it for the low 
 Triple O.G. so sucker free, I swear 
 You don't know me homie you can get the fuck from round here 
 I don't care who you will, who you with or who you know 
 Let's be clear, I'm a motherfuckin' G and you a hoe 
 Keep that Remy XO pulled up, bankrolled, swole up 
 Smell money in the air soon as I roll up, ay 
 I'm the coolest in the city bitch 
 While you lame trippin' on that goofy stupid silly shit 
 Who you ever seen it really did, super fly filthy rich, any with it killin' shit 
 Came in that bitch with my ego and got cash 
 I demand you to raise your hand and 
 Pledge Allegiance To The Swag 
 World got no money call me David Copperfield 
 A bitch'll disappear or the bitch will disappear 
 We control the corners, that's usual politics 
 Push a button from the mansion, hit you with a hollow tip 
 We two different niggas, I'm servin', he sniffing his 
 And I love that new Bugatti, how that bitch be shifting gears 
 Movin' how I move, I fuck with a selected few 
 Aviators and Audemars, tha bezel fluorescent blue 
 Down south nigga, had to climb up out the barrel 
 Outfox these niggas, now we rock out on apparrel 
 Pledge allegiance to the swag cause this shit is top notch 
 Jumpin' in and outta bitches like I'm playin' hopscotch 
 Jumpin' in and outta sixes like I got a car lot 
 And I got the type of digits that your bitch'll dial by 
 Young niggas bow down to the kings 
 In the presence of a Don, pay respect, kiss my ring 
 The Enzo off set, neck, wrist frosty 
 Deal ain't hundred mil, you ain't talkin' bout shit 
 Nigga wanna beef, he get the whole cal quick 
 If you talking bout some paper step into my office 
 On some pimp house shit, written out chicks, 
 Fuck 'em from behind, they be spitting out dick 
 Excuse me now but if I may make an announcement 
 I smoke no more but when I did I was blowin' ounces of gas 
 Ask the feds what I had when they found me 
 We down with whatever, don't interrupt my countin' 
 Ballin' on a daily basis, call my accountant 
 Only time you make it rain when you throwin' change in a fountain 
 Flow sick, crazy, derranged, need counselin' 
 He say I ain't all that, she say I'm outstandin' 
 Them lames all cheesy, square's outta season 
 When you see my swag, nigga, pledge your allegiance 
 Ay my n-gga I'm the type of stars and stripes you know what I'm saying, 
 You come f-ck with me on that bullsh-t you'll be seeing Stars and Stripes n-gga, you understand that n-gga, say I'm lying, think it's a game if you want to partna
