Hey let 'em talk, Let 'em hate 
 It ain't my fault they at the bottom, let 'em stay 
 Let 'em say whatever. Let 'em lie 
 Let 'em snitch, let 'em bleed, let 'em die 
 (T.I.) 
 Been through whatever together 
 I mean whatever the case 
 My partnas tell on me, never 
 We'll do whatever it take 
 Had no idea in the world 
 When we was peddlin' yay 
 That we'd be on top of the world 
 And still be together today 
 Man all we got is eachother 
 This bond ain't never gon' break 
 You know they say never say never 
 Well I say never today 
 Don't care whatever the charge 
 Be it Federal or State 
 Don't care whoever the broad 
 And he made whatever mistake 
 No talking down on the squad 
 Just know whatever you say 
 You would be straighten my nigga?? 
 Check you right there in your face 
 I hear you hatin' on my nigga 
 Well Ima tell him you hate 
 Came in the gates wit my niggas 
 And dats right where Ima stay 
 Don't matter what the conditions dat he run in wit police 
 We there the day that he sentenced 
 Be there the day he released 
 And all the days in between 
 You get whatever from me 
 Take care of the house and the kids 
 And girl she get whatever she needs.
