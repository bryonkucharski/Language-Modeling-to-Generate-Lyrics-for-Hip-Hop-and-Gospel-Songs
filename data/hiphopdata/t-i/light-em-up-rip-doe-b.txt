You was supposed to make it 
 You was supposed to make it 
 You was supposed to make it 
 Tell me why it is now that we live only for the moment 
 Erybody going deeper to the dark 
 Point of no return, following the evil, running from the Lord 
 Hatred in the heart 
 Poison [?] a nigga use to play and trade toys with a nigga 
 Now you gotta go to war with a nigga 
 Just because you got more than a nigga 
 Motherfucker Kamikaze you, they rather die then see you live fly 
 Crabs in a barrel, in ghetto America 
 Man, we just lucky that we make it out 
 See so much potential, lost some reputation, you would think eventually we will get it 
 They say you got it, they don't even want it 
 It just hurt so much for them to see you with it 
 What I know 'bout Satan, he patiently wait 
 To rob and steal and kill off greatness in the making 
 What we put together never let 'em take it 
 Goddamn shawty you were 'pose to make it 
 You was supposed to make it 
 You was supposed to make it 
 You was supposed to make it 
 You was supposed to make it 
 Lighters up, lighters up 
 Lighters up, lighters up 
 Lighters up, lighters up 
 Lighters up, lighters up 
 You was supposed to make it 
 You was supposed to make it 
 Lighters up, lighters up 
 Get your lighters up, lighters up 
 You know when I met you, sitting in the car 
 Buck head in the mall, you was something special 
 He was just a young nigga, 
 Still he never got excited, 
 It was hard to overwhelm a fat nigga with a eye patch, swingin' hard 
 Reppin' role tide Alabama 
 You can tell he was kickin' too much flavour on a country nigga made 'em wanna kill him 
 Still to see him smiling shawty, he be chillin' 
 Nigga wish him dead, he ain't even feel it 
 At your video, I could feel the [?] 
 We was at the club, nigga couldn't get it in, they was stuck outside 
 Start to look at you, and as you should you looked like "fuck I 'posed to do?" 
 Asked you 'bout it then, said "ay brah you cool?" 
 You said "I ain't worry 'bout the lil dude" 
 Get they feelings hurt, got a attitude, 
 They'll come around in a year or two 
 Made you Hustle Gang, let you in the family 
 Said "I get you rich" you said "you want a Grammy" 
 Showed you how to mix the Actavis 
 Candy, doin' 160 with me, he ain't panic 
 Called me yesterday, I say "lil bro what's happening? 
 Working with Pharell, chillin' in Miami" 
 All you said was "run it, book the flight I'm coming 
 'Fore I leave though, I gotta handle something" 
 I just said "ok" I hung up the phone 
 Couple hours later, damn my nigga gone 
 You was suppose to make it 
 You was suppose to make it 
 You was suppose to make it 
 You was suppose to make it 
 Devil's business, my brother gone 
 Supposed to be a living legend 
 Hating nigga sent you home 
 But when we see that guy, we gon' treat him like the sky 
 On the 4th of July 
 And light him up 
 Lighters up, lighters up 
 Lighters up, lighters up 
 Lighters up, lighters up 
 Lighters up, lighters up 
 You was supposed to make it 
 You was supposed to make it 
 Lighters up, lighters up 
 Get your lighters up, lighters up
