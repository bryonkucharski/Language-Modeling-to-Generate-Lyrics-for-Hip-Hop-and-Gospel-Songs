 'Cause I had to kill me a nigga 
 Aye I'm hoping for the best tryna dodge the stress 
 But sometimes that just ain't the way dat it go

 Now I don't know whatchu been told about me

 But I don't take no shit from no nigga 
 (And all niggas, no exceptions homeboy) 
 And I wonder what my kids a think about me 
 If I went to jail 
 (If I had to, would you love me) 
 'Cause I had to kill me a nigga 
 Disrespect me and we have to shoot it out in the street 
 Fuck it that's just how dat shit have to be
