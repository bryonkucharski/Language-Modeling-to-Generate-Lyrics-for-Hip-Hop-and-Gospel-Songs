(Feat. Big Kuntry King) 
 (No sweat, it's no sweat, it's no sweat, never never see me sweat) 
 (Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay tell 'em folk it's no sweat) 
 (Naw, no sweat, ay it's no sweat, it's no sweat.) 
 (Never let 'em see me sweat) 
 Hey you can ride with my dimes 
 She keeps 'em on the way 
 You say you need that window whirr but blow it away 
 It's no sweat 
 It's no sweat 
 It's no sweat 
 There's no sweat 
 (Never let 'em see me sweat) 
 Hey I'm the best in the game 
 Kick it with the best in the game 
 Ain't no need for me to worry 'bout the rest of you lames 
 It's no sweat 
 It's no sweat 
 It's no sweat 
 It's no sweat 
 Yeah you can call me the king 
 They also call me the vet 
 Haters can call me the reason their bitch ain't callin 'em back 
 The press be callin me cocky 
 I ask 'em what you expect 
 First album flopped, my label dropped 
 Man, I took off like a jet 
 Niggas hate on me often 'cause I'm a boss and exec 
 Do anything for my family, willing to die for respect 
 I bet I got it in cash, the same thing you got in a check 
 Wonder how I got it so fast, baby you gotta invest 
 I can be cool to St. Louis, I can be hot as Tibet 
 For you can get through security, I'd-done got on a jet 
 You must be under a rock if you haven't heard of 'em yet 
 Paris and Germany be buggin me I'm certain to that 
 Anything my heart desires, I can certainly get 
 The Ferrari light SV what Its be a convertible yes 
 A lotta niggas say they name but I ain't heard of 'em yet. 
 So when I check 'em they deserve that. 
 Hey you can ride with my dimes 
 She keeps 'em on the way 
 You say you need that window whirr but blow it away 
 It's no sweat 
 It's no sweat 
 It's no sweat 
 There's no sweat 
 (Never let 'em see me sweat) 
 Hey I'm the best in the game 
 Kick it with the best in the game 
 Ain't no need for me to worry 'bout the rest of you lames 
 It's no sweat 
 It's no sweat 
 It's no sweat 
 It's no sweat
