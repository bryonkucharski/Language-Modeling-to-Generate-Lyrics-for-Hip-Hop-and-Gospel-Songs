This for my niggas on the block dodging one time 
 Grinding hard, burning up at least one nine 
 Put ya middle fingers in the air one time 
 Ride with me, fuck the city up one time 
 Fuck the city up 
 Fuck the city up 
 Fuck the city up 
 Fuck the city up one time 
 Fuck the city up 
 Fuck the city up 
 Fuck the city up 
 Fuck the city up one time 
 Fresh out the bed getting head in a Range Rove 
 All about that bread, rubberbands on my bankroll 
 Bankhead, Simpson Road this Atlanta bitch 
 So fly, so gangsta, gutter, glamorous 
 We living out your fantasies, suckas can't handle this 
 They know we run the city shawty it's unanimous 
 Shout it out sold yay, nine forty-four 
 K, Quarter, half, whole thang nigga like the old days? 
 Hey, dope boy trap nigga swag 
 Hundred karat chain, quarter mil in the bag 
 I'm no longer poppin' tags I just let 'em hang 
 Sucka nigga doing bad I just do my thang 
 And I ain't frontin', straight by the book-G Code 
 Bad bitch, a flat stomach, fat booty, deep throat 
 Twenty grand in my pants, fifty in my peacoat 
 Jeezy fuckin' with me and we fuckin' up the city ho 
 I seen Jizzle in traffic with his top off 
 So much Louie shit it looking like it knock off 
 Violation, that'll get ya ass knocked off 
 Texas Pete nigga get ya ass hot sauce 
 Ever see me in the club with my shades off 
 It was a cool contest I guess the shades lost 
 28-5 yeah that's my cost 
 Bitch my closet so big I swear I got lost 
 What? Yeah I think I'm gon' need a map 
 We throw them birdies in the pool make 'em swim a lap 
 Whip it counterclockwise, that's the backstroke 
 Bitch my chain so big look like my back broke 
 Yeah we 'bout to fuck the city up, go broke 
 Bitch I'm balling so hard I need the whole court 
 Six spots in one night they call it club hopping 
 That new Tip and Jizzle shit, it got the club rocking 
 I'm talkin' A-Town shit, ex lean pound bit 
 Chopper, fifty round clip 
 Keep it with me, I 'on't slip 
 Anyone around Tip bout that drama boy I promise 
 Got a O of presidential, bitch I'm blowin' that Obama 
 Young Jeezy: 
 Yeah I'm talkin' plenty choppers, scopes on the A-R 
 You know how I do it, Forgiatos on the car 
 When I came up out the womb all I wanna be a star 
 Hope the feds don't stop me, life sentence in the car 
 Hey boy we spittin', reminiscin' bout when we was in the kitchen 
 Representin', niggas payin' bitches need to pay attention 
 And we on for the city freaks, this A-T-L 
 Do it for my nigga Big Meech and B.M.F. nigga 
 Young Jeezy: 
 Nigga, all I blow is strong bitch I'm straight for the week 
 Order five thousand dollars, threw it all on the freaks 
 Order twenty-five bricks, I put 'em all on the streets 
 Bitch it's shaketown and we turnt up while you sleep
