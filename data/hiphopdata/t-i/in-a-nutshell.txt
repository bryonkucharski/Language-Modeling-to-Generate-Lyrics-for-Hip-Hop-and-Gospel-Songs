In a nutshell, I'm the shit off in this bitch 
 The reason all the bad bitches switch off in this bitch 
 I'm flyer than a rocket, lift off up in this bitch 
 Everybody on their toes, I'm on my tip off in this bitch 
 In a nutshell, we getting money, cracking bitches 
 Paparazzi has their cameras snapping, taking pictures 
 Maserati snatchin sixty down the residential 
 I can tell from your reaction you don't know nobody realer 
 In a nutshell 
 Shawty I'm so far gone 
 Redhead and a blonde on each arm 
 Lanvin, Louboutin, Maison Margiela 
 They be blogging about what I got on, debating where they sell 'em 
 I tell 'em, even if you find 'em, you ain't finna get 'em 
 My swagger on Beretta: (click click) Pow! Get 'em 
 Boy I'm all about that balling 
 I just flossed a stunt but I don't front 
 Damn this shit they talking about 
 Bitch, I ain't got it because I don't want it 
 Sex on the Beamer, arrogant demeanor 
 She say she ain't freaking, bet I turn her like Tina 
 Mills on deck, got that check, no FEMA 
 Looking at my net like overlooking the marina 
 Them machines out front in the valet, not the alley 
 In my Ballys cracking bitches from the valley out in Cali 
 With that bread, I'm a beast, you don't know about me? 
 National Geographic did a show about me 
 Man, ain't nobody on my level 
 Just ask that new Bugatti or them diamonds in my bezel 
 I throw a ho a mazi I don't give a shit about it 
 Party with me, I collect the hottest bodies as a hobby 
 Fly as I can be, need no copilot 
 The bomb, kill shit dead, kamikaze 
 Better watch me though, I'm definitely popping, that I'm certain of 
 We grand hustle playboys, partner, ain't no work in us 
 All the money we throwing, they reimbursing us 
 Get 'em to the crib and fill their pussies, not their purses up 
 Need no dress rehearsal, bruh, I'm fresh as shit, it's effortless 
 Amazing hoes, impressing bitches: "Tip is just the best at this! " 
 I'm a stunner, kill 'em without a lama 
 They callin' me paris hunter whenever in Ferragamo 
 They love me in California, they feel him in Arizona 
 I got hoes so bad, I wanna drill 'em without a condom 
 I fill 'em up in the Hummer, I fill 'em up with the mali 
 Keep 'em off of the white and fill 'em up with the rati 
 I'm a Eastside Gotti with a beachside hottie (yeah) 
 It's always on me, I got a discreet sign, shottie 
 Since I've been getting bigger, I picked up a couple hobbies 
 Now I like to fly, now I like Ducatis 
 First I was just hot, now I'm like wasabi 
 In a nutshell, nigga, I'm the shit to everybody
