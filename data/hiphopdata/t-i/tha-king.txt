And in case you forgot, I'm the kinggggggg 
 Yeah, Yeah,...Aye, Aye, Aye,..Aye Who I'm is nigga (I'm the kinggggg) 
 T.I.P., Atlanta's own king of the south shawty (I'm the kinggggg) 
 Yeah, Yeah, Yeah... Better keep my name out ya mouth shawty (I'm the kinggg) 
 Yeah, PSC nigga, Aye, Aye 
 All hail Atlanta's own, owner of Atlanta's throne 
 If he ain't want no trouble he just shoulda left the man alone 
 This the scene shown and evident Atlantas known 
 The king's been the one representing all of Atlantas zones 
 Back when niggas been representing Atlanta wrong 
 Every shot he got, he put the hoods of Atlanta on 
 The big screen, then hit every trap and traveled on 
 Past, present to Texas to Alambama strong 
 Down in Miami, up to Louisiana homes, 
 From the Carolinas, Virginia, to David Banner's home 
 I'm well connected haters, best to mind ya manners homes 
 I got a nickel-plated 38, but hey the hammer chrome 
 And it shine like ya should set the phatom on 
 In it see me riding, getting blown like a saxphone 
 Hey shawty spitting shit it takes to put a candle on 
 If I ain't on ya tube dude, you must got ya channel wrong 
 I'm the king of the south, there's is none flyer 
 Sucker MC's outta call me sire, ya songs ok, but I'm on fire 
 24 inches on my rims and tires 
 I'm the king of the south, there is none flyer 
 Sucker MC's outta call me sire, you was on top 
 But I pass right by ya, I will not stop, I won't retire 
 I came, I saw, I conquered (ok) with no big names 
 No fame, no celebrity sponsors 
 Just the game and a flow that was bonkers 
 Nigga front if ya wanna, I dead niggas like the bitches from "Monster" 
 Now you been told, so don't say I ain't warn ya and don't 
 Let it alarm ya, when ya leaking, and the reapers upon ya 
 See dopeman and I'm creepin' upon ya, say that I ain't the king 
 But you just sour, you ain't think of it aren't ya 
 All the hating, is no time to respond to, I miss tryin' to conjure up 
 A way to get experience and launder, hey I thought ya record company 
 Con ya in to signing a deal shy of a mill 'cause they really ain't want ya 
 Moving yay, it's safe to say that they own ta ya 
 So it's time to move on to real estate, and get cake selling bigger stakes 
 I'm king of the south now, but there's fifty states 
 'Cause I'ma spread out and I'll eliminate who in the way 
 I'm 24 today, give to I'm 28 
 I'll be ruler of all that I survey and not just in the state 
 See I bend just to win, but I ain't finna break 
 Most you niggas fake, and I'll say it in ya face
