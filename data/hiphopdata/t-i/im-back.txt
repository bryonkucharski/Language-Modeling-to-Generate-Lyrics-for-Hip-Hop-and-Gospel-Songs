I never let you down I'mma shine on sight 
 Keep your mind on your grind and off of mines, alright? 
 Hard, I'mma ball on them squares, I flow 
 Quarter-million dollar cars everywhere I go 
 I know in the lead it may seem me might be 
 But no matter what they doing they don't do it like me 
 Like a G, I hold it down for the town I'm at 
 In a flash like that, recognize I'm back 
 Strike a match, catch a fire, any moment I decide 
 That's enough of all your lies, boy, your buzz just died 
 Step inside, super fly, to the shoes in they coupe 
 Then exit out with all the bitches like we always do 
 My desire to retire grow with every new crew 
 'Cause these guys just don't ride like my nigga, you too 
 Tight jeans, funny haircuts, dancing on the screen 
 It's about the real niggas in the game so it seems 
 Just pretend to holla pimpin', givin' shit a black eye 
 Next he say he trapping in my head I'm like why? 
 Be yourself, you ain't gotta pimp bone in your body 
 I can tell ya ain't never bought a key or caught a body 
 Nigga probably just seen Wayne, Gucci Mane, me and Boosie 
 All go to prison and they flip their whole image nigga trippin' 
 Listen, do for you, that ain't in the cars 
 Think the power is in your gun but overall it's in your heart 
 Nowadays I don't know what's up with niggas in the A 
 Guess he think he in the game but he really in the way 
 Violating, I was having conversations in the joint 
 But guess who done it and I promised I would put you on point 
 I'm disappointed in you, dog, you ain't hold it down at all 
 But I ain't going near ya jaw, just gonna show ya how to ball 
 Standin' tall through the storm on the yard or in the dorm 
 Cats in prison who expecting me to represent for 'em 
 I never let you down I'mma shine on sight 
 Keep your mind on your grind and off of mines, alright? 
 Hard, I'mma ball on them squares, I flow 
 Quarter-million dollar cars everywhere I go 
 I know in the lead it may seem me might be 
 But no matter what they doing they don't do it like me 
 Like a G, I hold it down for the town I'm at 
 In a flash like that, recognize I'm back 
 Strike a match, catch a fire, CTI, add gas 
 What's a Molotov cocktail? They never break a glass 
 Scary-ass nigga, wanna come for me? You better bring it 
 I ain't mad, I forgive 'em, God I know they ain't mean it 
 Yeah I seen it all before, hate I'm popping and they ain't 
 Rack they brain, try to think how to stop it and they can't 
 Ain't that lame? But then they hatred manifest to pure malice 
 I'm no longer being careless, I'mma let you niggas have it 
 Won't be satisfied 'til somebody dies and I'm patient, waiting 
 Know me and the reaper on a first name basis now 
 I'mma let you make it now, stay totally out the way for you 
 But know that we can take it any place you wanna take it to 
 Hating in your blood, 'cause guess it's just too late for you 
 All I could do is pray for you or organize a wake for you 
 Your choice, clearly I ain't hearing your voice 
 Keep it up and I'mma send your ass to chill with Aunt Joy 
 Hey, you can the bottom partner I'm up in the sky box 
 I got shit locked-down, nigga, why stop now? 
 I'm so above you hover over suckers, why drop down? 
 I'm so profound it goes down and 
 I never let you down I'mma shine on sight 
 Keep your mind on your grind and off of mines, alright? 
 Hard, I'mma ball on them squares, I flow 
 Quarter-million dollar cars everywhere I go 
 I know in the lead it may seem me might be 
 But no matter what they doing they don't do it like me 
 Like a G, I hold it down for the town I'm at 
 In a flash like that, recognize I'm back
