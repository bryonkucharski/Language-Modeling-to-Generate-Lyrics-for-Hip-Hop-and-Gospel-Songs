 You gettin' ready so I know we gon' be here awhile 
 In the bathroom flat irons and nail files 
 Spending hours in salons on your hairstyles 
 In the mall steady rackin' up the air miles 
 Hit the gym step on the scales stare at the number 
 You say you dropping 10 pounds preparing for summer 
 And you don't do it for the man, men never notice 
 You just do it for yourself you're the fucking coldest 
 Intelligent too ooh you're my sweetheart 
 I've always liked my women book and street smart 
 Long as they got a little class like half days 
 And the confidence to overlook my past ways 
 Time heals all, and heels hurt to walk in 
 But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in 
 And look I really think that nobody does it better 
 I love the way you put it together, ugh 
 Oh you fancy huh? 
 Oh you fancy huh? 
 Oh you fancy huh?

 Nail done, hair done, every thing did 
 Nails done, hair done, everything d'

 Well aren't you a breath of fresh air 
 From all these superficial gold digging bitches in here 
 They get a baller figure they ain't got to pick a career 
 Guess they plan on sucking somes dicks until some millions appear 
 Voila! you do it right he just might buy you a car 
 Unless you play these suckers just like B.o.B play the guitar 
 Now here you are, with your girls having drinks at the bar 
 I say I'm buying, you declinin' I think that's kinda bizarre 
 Independent with the demeanor of an R n' B singer 
 Naked ring finger (check) 
 M-3 beamer (check) 
 Champagne range 
 Triple white Jag 
 Closet full of brand new clothes and hand bags 
 Alexander McQueen, Prada, Gucci, Chanel 
 D&G, BCBG, Versace, Louie and Bebe 
 Ya don't need it greedy or easy as these other breezy's 
 Who fuck for balls or reason or bowls of baked ziti 
 Oh you fancy huh?

 And my N-Y girls let me see your hands

 Say go Cinderella 
 Go Cinderella 
 Orgasm blush 
 Lipstick 'n' concealer 
 Devil in a tight dress 
 Girl you a killer and ain't nobody realer 
 And ain't nobody realer, go, go, go, go, go 
 Go, go, go, 
 Showtime 
 Go, go, go, go, 
 As we proceed. 
 Uh, 5 and a half and boys 
 Ass is off the hook 
 Cinderella bout to lose the glass off her foot 
 And when I find it, is when I find you 
 And we can do the things we never got the time to 
 Better late than never, 
 But never late is better 
 They tell me time is money, well we'll spend it together 
 I'm down for whatever 
 You just lead the way 
 We go to dinner you don't even look at me to pay 
 Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me 
 And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley 
 How she got it I ain't never get to ask 
 I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash 
 Yeah, but shout out to the homeowners 
 The girls that got diplomas 
 And enough money to loan us, a little something extra 
 Should we ever need it 
 If it sounds like you then let me hear you repeat it 
 Oh you fancy huh?

 Nail done, hair done, every thing did 
 Nails done, hair done, everything d'

 Nails done, hair done, everything d' 
 Oh you fancy (fancy)
