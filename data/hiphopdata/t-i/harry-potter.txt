Oh, give me a home where the buffalo roam 
 Where the deer and the antelope play 
 Where seldom is heard a discouraging word 
 And the skies are not cloudy all day 
 Home, home on the range 
 Where the deer and the antelope play 
 Where seldom is heard a discouraging word 
 And the skies are not cloudy all day 
 How often at night where the heavens are bright 
 With the light of the glittering stars 
 Have I stood there amazed and asked as I gazed 
 If their glory exceeds that of ours 
 Home, home on the range 
 Where the deer and the antelope play 
 Where seldom is heard a discouraging word 
 And the skies are not cloudy all day 
 Then give me a land where the bright diamond sand 
 Flows leisurely down to the stream 
 Where the graceful white swan goes gliding along 
 Like a maid in a heavenly dream 
 Oh I would not exchange my old home on the range 
 Where the deer and the antelope play 
 Where the seldom is heard a discouraging word 
 And the skies are not cloudy all day
