We Got London On Da Track! 
 Young Thug: 
 Bustin' out the bando 
 A nigga jewelry will melt 'em like a candle 
 I went from rags to riches to a feature with Tip 
 I went from Smart Car to a bitch with some smart lips 
 And the F&N make my hip limp 
 I'm goin' fishin' with these little bitty shrimp dips 
 And my bank roll got a big dip 
 She gon' bring it on a big ship 
 Quite trill, no Quik Trip 
 I got drugs in the alley, no tip there 
 She just wanna have a good day 
 Smoke way more weed than a guy in L.A 
 I want them birds till next May 
 Never let 'em fly away 
 What!? I heard, aye 
 Listen what my nigga Tip say 
 If it ain't about the money 
 Don't be blowin' me up, nigga I ain't gettin' up 
 If it ain't about the money 
 Ain't no use in you ringin' my line, stop wastin' my time 
 If it ain't about the money 
 Nah I can't even hear what you say, I ain't finna do shit 
 If it ain't about the money 
 Bitch, you can miss me with it, bitch nigga miss me with it 
 Young Thug: 
 I pack an 11, I pack an 11 
 I ride in a gator, my shoes are Giuseppe 
 I'm slime like the reverend, I shoot at the reverend 
 Pants out the Gucci store, they stuck with lettuce 
 She try make the extras, I told on these bitches 
 When it's bout time to pay I'm a bail on these bitches 
 Ay what you think we in the neighborhood for? 
 Standin' at the corner store with a pocket full of dough 
 I'll be damned if a nigga wife a hood ho 
 Learned that from UGK back in "Pocket Full of Stones" 
 Put your money down, I could buck a hard 4 
 You playin' with it, I'm a send 'em through your car door 
 My watch flooded, shit sick, got Parvo 
 I'm doin' it for black and yellow, free Hardo 
 The head honcho, nigga no Tonto, nigga 
 I'm quick to put some bricks in a Bronco, nigga 
 Niggas talk shit, well I don't respond to no nigga 
 No murder, no dough, no convo 
 If it ain't about the money 
 Don't be blowin' me up, nigga I ain't gettin' up 
 If it ain't about the money 
 Ain't no use in you ringin' my line, stop wastin' my time 
 If it ain't about the money 
 Nah I can't even hear what you say, I ain't finna do shit 
 If it ain't about the money 
 Bitch, you can miss me with it, bitch nigga miss me with it

 Ay what you think we in the neighborhood for? 
 Standin' in the trap, slangin' good blow 
 Maybach used to slang that crack 
 Buy a stolen car while he bang that AK 
 If you ever took a loss better bring that back 
 Catcha' witcha' betcha' heat will blow your brains bout that 
 Know you better be, on your best behavior when addressing me 
 Byegones, we don't let 'em be 
 Niggas disrespect me, I'm a catch a felony 
 If you listen I can get you paid 
 But not interested in shit you say 
 If it ain't about the money 
 Don't be blowin' me up, nigga I ain't gettin' up 
 If it ain't about the money 
 Ain't no use in you ringin' my line, stop wastin' my time 
 If it ain't about the money 
 Nah I can't even hear what you say, I ain't finna do shit
