I've been travelin 
 On this road to long dead &gone t.i & j.t 
 Just trying to find 
 My way back home BUT 
 The old me 
 Is dead and gone 
 Dead and gone 
 I've been travelin 
 On this road to long 
 Just trying to find 
 My way back home 
 The old me 
 Is dead and gone 
 Dead and gone 
 I turn my head to the east 
 I don't see nobody by my side 
 I turn my head to the west 
 Still nobody in sight 
 So I turn my head to the north, 
 Swallow that pill 
 That they call pride 
 The old me is dead and gone, 
 The new me will be all right 
 I turn my head to the east 
 I don't see nobody by my side 
 I turn my head to the west 
 Still nobody in sight 
 So I turn my head to the north, 
 Swallow that pill 
 That they call pride 
 The old me is dead and gone, 
 The new me will be all right
