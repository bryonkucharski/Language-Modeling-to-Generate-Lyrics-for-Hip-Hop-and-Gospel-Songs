 Hey, hey, getting money 
 I'm getting my hustle on and I'm rollin' 
 Got whatever getting that paper, 
 Fresh out of prison, I'm glowing 
 Middle finger rated them haters 
 Get your chick before she gets stolen 
 One of my partner surely may take her 
 Send her back to you pussy all swollen 
 So and messed up just like her make up 
 Got an elephant mirror it's flawless 
 I remember all of y'all who was talkin' 
 Got a good mind to run in your office 
 Swoop your ass in front of your bosses 
 My partner died in my anno 
 I'm responsible for his mama 
 His daughter too, bet you she can go whatever college she wanna 
 Still that rough bands in my bank roll, broke something I can't go 
 Bitch yellin' out I'm the shit 
 I'm like tell me something I don't know 
 My broker cost in my stockses 
 Up 20% to my profits, inscreases even in my absence 
 So my attitude is up anxious 
 Contract all most inspired... make my contract big and ball shit 
 Got bitches on my side shit, and field already watchin 
 Just one more year of paper, then I'm back to blowin' brocolli

 Hey, hey, getting money 
 I'm the king of Texas I put on 
 On the block, tryina put the whole hood on 
 Stay stip, when them other niggas steer wrong 
 Street sip, only thing a nigga still on 
 My niggas on dip from same sip like shook 
 Attitude fuck they sippin good 
 Tell them I got a mill never gotta worry 'bout a thing 
 I represented the best I could 
 Stackin paper of rap, she get flipped and I'm back to the trap 
 Trap like... if you don't get that, the bitch will get slapped 
 Bitch I pop up, get this proper,.. same things I got shut up 
 I won't be stopped, by the way you niggas seen 
 Money getting big like look what I got up 
 You ain't seen that... drop, chain stay icy, bitch I stay hot 
 Yeah, I'm truth, that's what you lack 
 It's my time fuck your plot 
 I got my team strong and my guns loaded 
 City mine, the whole hood voted 
 This murda bizness they know I showed it 
 Suicide, both doors flooded, 
 Touching dod, got that work, cod 
 They living free, you got a bfe 
 That talkin' cool but ain't shit to me 
 I'll be damn if I go back, this sosa gang and you know that 
 We earn respect and you owe that 
 Get the middle finger like hold that!

 So many lanes, so much say, 
 But that's another topic for another day 
 They know face to face I clown nigga 
 Why you ain't talking shit now nigga 
 Don't try to death me up, you ain't down with us 
 When I'm anger bitch, don't I sound better? 
 'Cause I'm so sincere, it's so severe 
 That you know through all that I persevere 
 I died along my hopes still... my ghost to fear 
 My rational is all... just smash the gas take full advantage 
 My patience short, my temper bad 
 So you will find me everywhere you ain't at... 
 Head to the bank with the chip we got 
 I hug your hoe she passin out 
 Before she hit the ground I'm mashin out 
 I'm bossin up and I'm stayind down 
 Got racks on racks just laying round 
 I say now check this dig that, dig that, dig that 
 Hey, check this dig that, you know I be getting that 
 Money in them big stacks, you broke I can fix that, yeah 
 You broke I can fix that, hey, hey, hey
