Jesus loves me 
 This I know 
 For the Bible tells me so 
 Sometimes I wake up feel like I'm in Forest City, Arkansas 
 Although I'm free I'm still a prisoner of all our soul 
 Sometimes I lead it, roof in 4, you never ride down since 
 Just prayin' homie, and reminiscin 
 Sometimes my nightmare seems so real, feel like I'm still in prison 
 I reach out far to meet her hand, I'm trippin' 'cause she listen 
 It's pitch black dawg, like I'm in solitary 
 So if my freedom was a dream, Lord please prepare me 
 It seems like Satan want my soul and he refuse to share me 
 My former 3 ain't talk about me like I'm getting buried 
 Bastards want me in the casket for my head cold 
 Trouble in my soul, these devils got a hold 
 Did everything, you need to kill me, like you did to Joe 
 He took my diamonds, took my rhymes, took my fame and gold 
 He took my babysitters, he took my wife and kids 
 But he can't take nothing God can't give me back again 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 I went to jail, stood tall, then I fell again 
 It seems like I'm Jonah and right back in that will again 
 I felt the panic when they locked me in that cell again 
 I had to pray and meditate, control my breath again 
 Like Lazarus I've risen from a better death again 
 The Lord is with me, I could stand against a thousand men 
 I read the songs of David, prayed to be like Solomon 
 God's wisdom walkin' all amongst these hollow men 
 I'm a king, I dare to lead when they just follow me 
 I see a better way, I'm keeping my eyes on the sparrow 
 I'm exiting my Egypt, tell 'em wave goodbye to pharaoh 
 Mother told me fore she left this earth that I was special 
 Ever 'cause I'm special, they gon make me suffer 
 Like they crucified Jesus right in front his mother 
 Suckas, but he arose on the 3rd day 
 Just save your head and get a favor, let the church say... 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Jesus loves me 
 This I know 
 For the Bible tells me so 
 Yes, He loves me 
 This I know 
 For the Bible tells me so 
 Oh
