 Rick Ross: 
 Who fuckin' with fat boy, I traffic my body weight 
 So much cake in the club damn near caught me a fair case 
 My old school is running Gatorade in my Chevy 
 My money is safe, I'm runnin' last [?] 
 We barricaded in front, the waterfalls in the back 
 Enough crack for a month, you smell it all in my raps 
 Niggas wanna be famous, I want the luxury tax 
 Not one of my checks like my company facts 
 I'm pumpin' my gas comin' down Cleveland Ave 
 How much a nigga worth? Ho don't even ask 
 Ten mill with Diddy, I'm getting money with Tip 
 When you see me in the city then it's money we get
