(T.I. - Verse 1) 
 Ay say KT 
 I remember bro standing out ten of uh 
 Flip a bird split it up 
 Antenna stickin' up 
 For crooked cop patrollin' 
 If the rad-doh rollin' 
 All the dough I'm throwin' 
 Fuck a jail I ain't going tonight 
 Quick to pull a 4-4 in the fight 
 Under the street lights 
 Rollin' the dice 
 We was so enticed 
 By niggas like slick money and ice 
 We figure prison end should come with the light 
 Along with losin' your life 
 And there were no way we thought 
 We'd go to jail for any case we caught 
 For all the yay we bought 
 Not a dime did we say we borrowed 
 Bought damn near every pair of jeans at the mall 
 Had our way with the broads 
 Hit the rink but we ain't skatin' at all 
 Seem like every other day we brawl 
 That AK on call 
 When I think about all we done 
 It's amazing to see how far we come 
 Remember 
 (Mitchelle'L - Chorus) 
 I remember walkin' 
 Didn't have a dollar in my pocket 
 Now I'm watching stocks like what's the options 
 Ooh Ooh 
 Ooh Ooh 
 How life's changed 
 I remember hustlin' 
 Tryin' to get these crooked cops off us 
 Now I read about it in my office 
 Ooh Ooh 
 Ooh Ooh 
 How life's changed 
 (T.I. - Verse 2) 
 Ay say C-Roy 
 Remember days we was slangin' the hard 
 In a crib with no lights 
 We used to stay in the dark 
 Remember Captain Mac bonin' man 
 They were retarded 
 I don't know who kept us laughing the hardest 
 Since our sacks was the largest 
 Didn't take us long to corner the market 
 I remember everyday was a party 
 15 16 with dreams of being cocaine bosses 
 In pursuit of that 
 We made so many terrible choices 
 Like the time we made away with that Millennium 
 From the dealership 
 Before our day won we killin' em 
 Late nights 
 Gun fights 
 High speed chases 
 So close to the good life we taste it 
 Damn the consequences pimp 
 If it's a chance we take it 
 First case a month in juvenile and get probation 
 When I think about all we done 
 It's amazing to see how far we come 
 Remember 
 (Mitchelle'L - Chorus) 
 I remember walkin' 
 Didn't have a dollar in my pocket 
 Now I'm watching stocks like what's the options 
 Ooh Ooh 
 Ooh Ooh 
 How life's changed 
 I remember hustlin' 
 Tryin' to get these crooked cops off us 
 Now I read about it in my office 
 Ooh Ooh 
 Ooh Ooh 
 How life's changed 
 (Scarface - Verse 3) 
 We started small time dope game 
 Hustlin' that cocaine 
 In the state traffickin' 
 High feeling no pain 
 Numb to the fact 
 That we was poisoning our own kind 
 I ain't give a fuck 
 He gettin' his so I want mine 
 Young and with that attitude 
 Somebody finally gimme that 
 I ain't give a fuck how I got it 
 It was real as that 
 So if I had to peel a cat 
 Somebody was dead then 
 Since I'm a killer 
 That's the condition my head's in 
 Can't work too hard to get my money 
 I refuse to 
 Slave for the next man a raise nigga fuck you 
 These streets are 9 to 5 
 You want it we can get it for ya 
 And even though they steady changin' 
 This is still a hustle 
 Still got them same rules 
 Man I be the same game 
 We'd even found some brand new money 
 Still we maintain 
 This ain't integrity 
 We upheld in the street life 
 Livin' the mother fuckin' dream 
 Niggas singin' like... 
 (Mitchelle'L - Chorus) 
 I remember walkin' 
 Didn't have a dollar in my pocket 
 Now I'm watching stocks like what's the options 
 Ooh Ooh 
 Ooh Ooh 
 How life's changed 
 I remember hustlin' 
 Tryin' to get these crooked cops off us 
 Now I read about it in my office 
 Ooh Ooh 
 Ooh Ooh 
 How life's changed
