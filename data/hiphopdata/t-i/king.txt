You know, may no man, woman, child, nor animal walk a lifetime on God's green Earth and not expect to be tested. 
 Just observe and acknowledge when the occasion is risen to by champions, you know what I'm sayin'? 
 Let this speak for itself and handle me accordingly. 
 When you see me nigga, it ain't no secret, you know what's happenin'. 
 No fake, no flaw, man. Straight like that. It's the king, bitch 
 You lay down, lay down, you lay down 
 I'm a king 
 Play around if you want and get hammered, leave you on your dick 
 I come from Atlanta, the '80s and '90s but we was as real as it gets 
 And that's why we still here 
 Best watch what you say, you could pay with your life tonight 
 Fuck around and get killed 
 As I pray to the Lord, tell him if I should die tonight 
 First let me put up a mil' 
 Inside of the hands of one of the men 
 Who's gonna go kill or go to the pen 
 If ever should blood out my body may spill 
 The nigga, their partner, their family, they're killed 
 I'm talkin' for real, you kickin' that rah-rah to me 
 I LOL, shit's haha to me 
 Nigga ever disrespect, I wave bye bye to him 
 Got a Maybach, it's just like a Mazda to him 
 Chew him, up like the mouth in the teeth 
 Or you drop to beneath the belly of the beast 
 Geesh, call me the chief 
 The capo, capisce? Got the streets on a leash 
 The way that I walk it, exactly the way that I talk it 
 One took a hit and he rest in a coffin 
 Forever for all of that shit he was talkin' 
 You go against me, what you better do, shawty, is 
 You lay down, lay down, you lay down 
 I'm a king 
 You lay down, lay down, you lay down 
 I'm a king 
 Despicable me, I'm no typical G, got your bitch on her knees 
 When I skeet in her tree 
 Only came in here for what I wanted and shit that I don't 
 If you have it, you keep 
 I'm so diabolical, dick harder than a cut molecule 
 You say she wifey, I say she a party girl 
 Type to eat bitches out when she on molly 
 You'll never know, which is to me that shit's obvious 
 She say you're pitiful, they think you're popular 
 That ain't gon' keep my lil' partner from poppin' yah 
 Take it, you droppin', you cement your bottle 
 So won't be no poppin' up, body's erased 
 No weapon, no charge, no witness, no questions 
 No stressin', no body, no case 
 Errbody okay, I will off that guy with my chopper, I throw it away 
 You can just buy me a cake 
 And most of the niggas you see standin' by me today 
 Were trappin' with me in the A 
 And down here we always three bitches, Rodeo, LA 
 And killers who do what we say 
 This could be the end of you today 
 My gunner run into you today 
 Here's what I suggest you do when they spray 
 You lay down, lay down, you lay down 
 I'm a king
