Hey stop fussin' all the time man, listen 
 Victoria Monet (T.I.): 
 I love you and I know you love me too 
 (I love you shawty) 
 I love you and I ain't ashamed to beg you to stay 
 (I know you love me) 
 So that we can be together forever 
 (So high, I get what I need from you 
 Shawty I get on my knees for you 
 And I get what I need from you 
 I get on my knees for you 
 You wanna go to war, wanna live in peace 
 Wanna be right or be with me 
 You wanna go to war, wanna live in peace 
 Wanna be right or be with me 
 Who? Me! Who? Me 
 Wanna be right or be with me 
 Who? Me! Who? Me 
 That's not rhetorical, answer it, please) 
 T.I.: 
 I wonder would it matter much 
 If I never fucked and I just fell in love 
 Or maybe if I never fell in love and I just fucked 
 I swear, man, shit was simpler when I was sellin' drugs 
 You ain't know me then though, ain't that what ya think 
 You was in the bed, I was trafficking the thing 
 Man after everything we will never be the same 
 Man I'm tired of tellin' lies, know you sick of playin' games 
 I remember you got a tattoo, put my name on it 
 Put you in a wedding dress with a train on it 
 I went and spent a whole mil just to go chill 
 In Miami, and I be damned if she don't know my love real 
 How dare you compare me to dude, girl chill 
 My piece so close up on it, you don't see what it is 
 Shawty, I die, kill, for you if you keep it real 
 Go to jail, even if I gotta kneel I will

 T.I.: 
 I can't see you with no me 
 But, you left me and I'm just me 
 So, I'm gon' be what they gon' be 
 And I know he want you but they want me 
 Girl, together or apart 
 But you be forever in my heart, I swear 
 And even if we end up here, I know it hard 
 I never love that way again, I swear to God 
 I be breaking down, you be playing hard 
 She chose to bid it all, watch how you play your cards 
 Now you runnin' 'round town with education hatin' broads 
 Going at me, got me hot, but hold up, how is they involved? 
 And you can't say that I ain't changed 
 Your whole life since we met that day 
 And when we get it right, God bless that day 
 But until then, shawty, I just pray 
 And I just say
