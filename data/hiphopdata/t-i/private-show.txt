Chris Brown: 
 Girl take it off for me, you know just what I want 
 It's always hard to leave, this private show 
 Let me see it, see it, let me see it take it off 
 Let me see it take it off, take it off (let me) 
 Let me see it take it off, take it off 
 Shawty let me see you take it off, toot it up 
 Back into me, pass it to me 
 Imagine hanging half way off the mattress while your ass is moving 
 Up and down, back and forth, so ratchet when you supposed to be 
 A lady to the naked eye, but a nasty lil' hold of me 
 If only the masses could see your ass when it's in action, I swear 
 Manhandle you and pullin' places, I make you take it right here 
 You got no idea, listen girl with this pole right here, ow 
 Beat it up, be grabbin' hair 
 Leavin' hand prints on your derrière 
 Now, can you, just kiss it for me while I'm doin' 'bout a hundred on the highway 
 Get it, slap it wet, get it bent, girl I bet you could finish before I pull up on the driveway 
 And this ain't no child play, this grown man B girl I'll say 
 I got your ass in the scope, ain't gotta be close shawty I could hit your pussy from a mile away

 Let me see it, see it, let me see it take it off 
 Let me see it take it off, take it off (let me) 
 Let me see it take it off, take it off 
 Hey let me see you take it off, lay it down 
 Like this my last day in town 
 I'm puttin' in work no playin' around 
 But shawty I'm sayin', now 
 Me let you walk away without walkin' funny 
 Be talkin' 'bout me, I highly doubt it 
 So, let me take you to a private island 
 Make you take this dick, don't cry about it 
 How it feel to you girl? Don't lie about it, no 
 Shawty you ain't gotta lie about it 
 Blackin' out in that pussy like a power outage 
 Got a man, well he gon' be sour about it 
 But I just wanna be on your team 
 Provide you with your protein 
 Leave wet dreams all in your face 
 Them tattoos all over your waist 
 Got me rock solid, can't touch that 
 I'm fuckin' you like I'm upset 
 Chokin' you, long stroking you 
 Say you came twice, not enough yet 
 Because a cat that phat is very rare 
 And my dick ought to be buried there 
 I love how you kick it in public 
 But in private, we on some wild shit 
 Girl take it off for me, you know just what I want 
 It's always hard to leave, this private show 
 Let me see it, see it, let me see it take it off 
 Let me see it take it off, take it off (let me) 
 Let me see it take it off, take it off 
 Chris Brown: 
 Made a reservation, you're my favorite place to be 
 All day, contemplatin' baby, waitin' patiently 
 There's nobody like you, body way you climb on top of me 
 We're in hell and lady you're the closest thing to heavenly 
 I want you all to myself, nothing at all, I can't help it 
 'Cause what you go on is fly as hell, but I need a better view 
 Just show me the real you 
 Girl take it off for me, you know just what I want 
 It's always hard to leave, this private show 
 Let me see it, see it, let me see it take it off 
 Let me see it take it off, take it off (let me) 
 Let me see it take it off, take it off
