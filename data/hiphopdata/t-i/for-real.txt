 She said she like the paint, she said she like the grill, she said she like the soft material, I say for real. (how you got it for real?) 
 The ?? is kill, the emblem is ill, she said that maybe we can get away, I tell her yeah

 Yup, really wasn't mucch to it... I'm tryna back up off her, she be begging me to do it... she be telling me about her pussy, about how it gettin' gooey, and how she couldn't wait for me to stick my dick in to it. I said you got a man, she say, but he a square... he don't even be liking smack my ass and pull my hair, he keep me in the house and he don't take me anywhere... or buy me anything and I don't think it really fair. 
 I say you got a point, but you don't wanna cheat... she say he making love and she wanna be a freak, and she got another side, she say you don't wanna see... and in case you wanna know, that's why she wanna be with me!

 Ay, I got it like this. she ain't fun to trip and serve her clit to me and tip... I met her in miami, told her pimpinn coming soon, and she gon' bust it wide open just to get off in that room... in the meantime let me introduce myself, extraordinary baby... unlike anybody else... (say wassya name?) well that's irrelevant, but maybe this'll help, know when your sucking on me... you sippin on top shit... 
 Ay, you see me, top down, jet black, rollls wit a bitch that don't like girls but I'm thinking we can fix that... hit this blunt, one of these and sit back, wait a half an hour... all your issues, you'll forget that ... now she kissin' on my nipples, licking on my six pack, blowin' in my ear, then sliding down to where my dick's at... my phone just be humming, so the pussies just be folllowing me, honestly... I'm just tryna tell you how I got it for real.
