Hey, hey 
 Hey what's happenin' e'erybody 
 I hope they get my good side 
 You know I gotta look good when I walk out the house 
 You know I know the camera's following 
 I know they taking pictures, right Drama 
 Ay man, you watch it I live it, you dig that 
 Y'all sit back relax get some popcorn man 
 I'm gonna make it a good show, you dig that 
 This goin' make a hell of a movie huh 
 My life, your entertainment 
 You watch it while I live it (live it) 
 I walk they follow (ay) 
 I talk they holla (ay) 
 Just here for your amusement 
 My life, your entertainment 
 You watch it while I live it (live it) 
 You waitin' for me to lose it 
 I guess I'm just here for your amusement 
 The price of fame I think I paid, want my change I done gave 
 E'erything in my possession for my seconds on the stage 
 For my name up in lights and multi-million record sales 
 I done gave up my life, can't get a moment to myself 
 When alone I ask myself, is it worth it? I ain't perfect 
 Neither is anybody else, but I think my kids deserve 
 To be with Daddy out in public without all the interruptions 
 When the lies and gossip's published I'm the topic of discussion 
 And I stay in trouble just to show these suckers I ain't lost it 
 And I'd do it all again that's the funny thing about it 
 I ain't playing, boy I'm 'bout it 
 Will I change, boy I doubt it 
 I done been a lot of things, I ain't never been a coward 
 See the paparazzi crowded all around me now 
 Same niggas who was dissin' want a pound like I'm C now 
 Showered with support from my adoring fans 
 They hear T.I.'s arrested they're like here we go again 
 My life, your entertainment 
 You watch it while I live it (live it) 
 I walk they follow (ay) 
 I talk they holla (ay) 
 Just here for your amusement 
 My life, your entertainment 
 You watch it while I live it (live it) 
 You waitin' for me to lose it 
 I guess I'm just here for your amusement 
 You've seen it all before, guys know how the story goes 
 It's like 2Pac never died, sit back, enjoy the show 
 You see the shit that scares you senseless, I done lived through it 
 Knew the risks and the consequences and I still do it 
 And then I'm so fresh, them niggas mildew it 
 Not just a actor by profession, pimp, I live movies 
 That's why they whisper when they see me, point and stare at me 
 'Cause they just wanna live through me vicariously 
 Fashion weekend, Paris week, party like a rockstar 
 Get blown by a top model 'til she catch lockjaw 
 Got the dough you get a year, stashed in my sock drawer 
 Showed you the troubles and the struggles of an outlaw 
 Top dog would not fall, I am not y'all 
 Couple pages out the calendar and I'm out y'all 
 Kid listen, pay attention, you don't wanna be me 
 It's safer to watch it on T.V. 
 My life, your entertainment 
 You watch it while I live it (live it) 
 I walk they follow (ay) 
 I talk they holla (ay) 
 Just here for your amusement 
 My life, your entertainment 
 You watch it while I live it (live it) 
 You waitin' for me to lose it 
 I guess I'm just here for your amusement 
 See I don't think it would even matter (to me) 
 Woking a nine to (five) would it be better 
 I mean be honest, would you care to gossip about me 
 Not likely 
 I guess that's just the way that it goes (the way that it goes) 
 ('Cause I know) See I can be somewhere out keeping it cool 
 (And get told) Almost anything instead of the truth 
 Y'all know more than I do, it's breaking news to me too 
 Easy killer y'all know that ain't how I move (ooh) 
 He said and she said (what) I did what, with they (who) 
 No not me I said (not me) she gave me no head (ooh) 
 Won't get me again (hey) I pleaded the fifth (hey) 
 I know better than to ever talk during the film... 
 In' and flashing lights can blind your eyesight 
 To when you can't see what's wrong from right 
 Well shorty 'til you walk a mile in my shoes 
 And understand this is who I am 
 Usher I completely concur 
 Life can be such a blur, obviously we prefer 
 Our privacy but instead we endure 
 Yes sir, don't expect nothin' less of me 
 'Cause this goin' probably be this way until the death of me 
 But for the hustle and the lady on my arm now 
 Plus all my kids and my mom's I'm a calm down 
 And yo, we doin' just fine, and the time's just flyin' 
 Live one headline at a time 
 My life, your entertainment 
 You watch it while I live it (live it) 
 I walk they follow (ay) 
 I talk they holla (ay) 
 Just here for your amusement 
 My life, your entertainment 
 You watch it while I live it (live it) 
 You waitin' for me to lose it 
 I guess I'm just here for your amusement
