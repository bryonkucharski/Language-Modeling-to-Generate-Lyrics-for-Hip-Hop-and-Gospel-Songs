They told me it's never too late for prayer 
 Well Lord! Pray for us niggas 
 'Cause we ready to die for this shit 
 If I die tonight I pray I get buried in clean drawers 
 Line us all up, just bury me with my dawgs 
 If I die tonight I pray I get buried in clean drawers 
 Line us all up, just bury me with my dawgs 
 Bury me with my dawgs, bury me with my dawgs 
 Line us all up, bury me with my dawgs 
 Bury me with my dawgs, bury me with my dawgs 
 Line us all up, bury me with my dawgs 
 I look to my left, I look to my right 
 All I see is my blood, all I see is my life 
 If it go down tonight, my nigga look out for momma 
 Been robbing my whole life, I gotta look out for karma 
 Selling them white squares I swear I'm well prepared 
 Fifty in my chopper whoever could go to hell 
 Chopper still heat seeking, block getting hotter 
 When them niggas go to beefing, slide me till we got 'em 
 If I die tonight I pray I get buried in clean drawers 
 Line us all up, just bury me with my dawgs 
 If I die tonight I pray I get buried in clean drawers 
 Line us all up, just bury me with my dawgs 
 Bury me with my dawgs, bury me with my dawgs 
 Line us all up, bury me with my dawgs 
 Bury me with my dawgs, bury me with my dawgs 
 Line us all up, bury me with my dawgs 
 Machine gun man, seen him on the news 
 Every gun I had was one the home invaders couldn't use 
 Had a nigga catch me slipping, I refuse, not a chance 
 Listen dude, Tip can use any tool known to man 
 And don't think that I can't hit you just cause it ain't in my hand 
 Got a sniper, drop your ass where you stand, understand? 
 Fifty cal with a scope and a chopper, boy you got to 
 Plan a way straight to the undertaker, know me for the doctor 
 Should I die, lay me next to my daughter Lelah and my partner 
 Rap your ass off somethin' proper with that blacka, blacka, blacka 
 Did just what I gotta do, it's me or you and boy I'm saying 
 Know that ATF listening, I'm just playing, I'm just playing 
 If I die tonight I pray I get buried in clean drawers 
 Line us all up, just bury me with my dawgs 
 If I die tonight I pray I get buried in clean drawers 
 Line us all up, just bury me with my dawgs 
 Bury me with my dawgs, bury me with my dawgs 
 Line us all up, bury me with my dawgs 
 Bury me with my dawgs, bury me with my dawgs 
 Line us all up, bury me with my dawgs
