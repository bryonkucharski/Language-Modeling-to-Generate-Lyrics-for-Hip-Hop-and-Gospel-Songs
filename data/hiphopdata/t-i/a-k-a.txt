La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la 
 Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
 Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
 Can you hear me now? 
 This is not the girl you used to know 
 Talking to you now 
 I don't think you want me to explode 
 It's the countdown 
 It took you too long to find out 
 What you want, right now 
 I'm too gone to stay around 
 Switching up my style 
 Now our faces never stick around 
 A.K.A, never hold you down 
 A.K.A, can't figure it out 
 A.K.A, you don't know me now 
 Oh you don't know me now 
 A.k.a 
 A.k.a 
 Oh oh oh, you don't know me now, A.K.A 
 You don't know me now 
 Oh, you don't know me now 
 They all seem to watch you when you go 
 I was here, oh, I was here before 
 What goes around, comes back around for sure 
 So I'mma let you, I'mma let you know oh oh 
 It took you too long to find out 
 What you want, right now 
 I'm too gone to stay around 
 Switching up my style 
 Now our faces never stick around 
 A.K.A, never hold you down 
 A.K.A, can't figure it out 
 A.K.A, you don't know me now 
 Oh you don't know me now 
 A.k.a 
 A.k.a 
 Oh oh oh, you don't know me now, A.K.A 
 You don't know me now 
 Oh, you don't know me now 
 Ay, what it is now shawty (what it is) 
 You was fuckin' with a sucker 
 But you dealin' with a real now shawty (for real) 
 Anybody got a problem they can feel my forty 
 Tell me how you feel now shawty (how you feel) 
 God damn, is you as good as you look 
 Standing in the hood but you look like you came off the page of a book 
 Pretty face and your ass like a hook 
 In the rain, like a crab when I look 
 Whew, you are such a distraction 
 You act like you want it I give you the business 
 Tear that shit up, girl, as God as my witness 
 Would you bend if you don't know me? 
 Honey I'm considered your OG 
 Bitch don't like life 'cause you don't want me 
 Think you could do better? Well we sure gon' see 
 Hold up, back in 04 drive, you don't know me 
 The moral of the story, you don't know me 
 Got there right now, I'm the man right now 
 Anybody get it, we can get it in right now 
 Listen one thing still in the pen right now 
 Killer gun, take your cell, I'd be dead by now 
 But stare right now, get bread like wow 
 When the drop hit, now get head like ow 
 We let that AK go by J. Lo 
 You don't know me now 
 Oh you don't know me now 
 It took you too long to find out 
 What you want, right now 
 I'm too gone to stay around 
 Switching up my style 
 Now our faces never stick around 
 A.K.A, never hold you down 
 A.K.A, can't figure it out 
 A.K.A, you don't know me now 
 Oh you don't know me now 
 (Tell 'em, tell 'em) A.K.A 
 (Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em) A.K.A 
 Oh, you don't know me now, A.K.A 
 You don't know me now 
 Oh, you don't know me now
