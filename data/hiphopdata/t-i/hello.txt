Governor: 
 Hello 
 Hello 
 Hello 
 Hello

 Hello 
 T.I.: 
 Hey, what's happenin'? 
 It's been a minute, huh? I'm just hollerin' 
 How you doin'? 
 It's been a minute since I seen ya 
 I fell off for the scene 
 'Cause it seem like you wanted other things than da king 
 Why you fightin', fussin', cussin', and disagreein' wit da king? 
 When you got cribs, cars, bling, and a king wit da king? 
 Is the grass as green as it seemed in ya dreams 
 Are you gettin' all the things that you needed and I ain't bring 
 Does it satisfy your self-esteem bein seen on da screen 
 Is this new nigga the real thing or is just a lil' fling? 
 Did he buy a nice bracelet and get ya a lil' ring? 
 Or give you all the attention and the lil' things? 
 He know what to do with the stuff you stuff in them lil' jeans? 
 Do he stand up and lean in it till you start screamin'? 
 Or smack your ass and kiss your G-String to start eatin? (muah) 
 You get how you need it, not only when it's convenient 
 I just pick up the phone and call you every week or two to let you know I miss you 
 To see how that other nigga treatin' you 
 Governor: 
 I remember morning, noon, and night 
 I used to hold you tight 
 I know we used to fuss and fight 
 But I'm just calling to say (hello) Hello, (hello, oh baby) 
 See time has a funny way of keeping us close 
 Even though we never stayed, together 
 I just wanted to say (hello) hello (hello) 
 T.I.: 
 Hello? 
 Ay, it's me 
 Hey, what's happenin'? How ya doin'? 
 I know plenty of niggas pursuin' them panties, all for the screwin' 
 Fly you down to Miami 
 Let you walk the red carpet wit a ? at da Grammys 
 But I'm what he can never be, a boss, understand me? 
 He pose and take ? things he buy for ya 
 He got you a rose, but that don't mean he'd die for ya 
 Hey, maybe I got too much pride to cry for ya 
 But not too much to call you and tell you that I adore ya 
 And tell you how I'm missin' you, lovin' you, and kissin' you 
 And think about the good old days and wanna visit you 
 This song I'd like to listen to whenever reminisicin' you 
 You, stay on my mind nevermind how I picture you 
 Think about the past and all the time that I spent witchu 
 Rubbin on that ass from behind as I dig in you 
 Never been a doubt in my mind that I was diggin' you 
 How I love you shawty, you'll never find another nigga to

 Governor: 
 Every now and then I think of you 
 And I can't lie I be wantin' you 
 But I understand that I'm not your man 
 And I also know that the future's not in your hands 
 Every now and then I'd call you to say how you doin' 
 And baby I miss you 
 Girl, this is just to say hello 
 Hello Baby

 Hello, hello...
