Let it go 
 Let the good take hold 
 I'm ah brother from the West 
 Who was blessed with a soul 
 Let me tell you 'bout a place 
 You probably don't even know 
 We still live in Cali 
 Gotta style cultural 
 We was 
 Known from the 60's 
 From panthers to hippies 
 Now were known for 
 Murders pimps and three-sixty's 
 Side shows high speed chases too 
 And a crack epidemic that will turn ya blue 
 And an Aids epidemic that can end ya too 
 It's the Yay baby brother and I thought you knew 
 Oakland to Vallejo 
 Vallejo to the Zay 
 The Zay to the Sko' 
 AKA as the Bay 
 Unique so to speak 
 In a whole lotta ways 
 We hardly get the love â??'cause we close to LA 
 We got our own slang 
 But everybody took it 
 Now we goin' dumb down the Av drivin' crooked 
 This the way 
 In the Bay (in the Bay) 
 In the Bay [Repeat: x1] 
 In ya little kuddy cold from the Northern Pacific 
 Beach always cold 
 So don't get the game twisted 
 Thugs reprocessed to the death packin' biscuits 
 Weed almost legal the trees it's terrific 
 We got 
 Cannibis clubs 
 Filipinos and Blacks 
 Latinos from all over the map 
 Chinese and Vietnamese 
 So don't get jacked 
 Samoans Indians Tongans Thai's 
 It's the Bay homie 
 And we multiplies 
 We never act shy when it's time to ride 
 And we claim 2 Pac as a source of pride 
 Said we claim 2 Pac as a source of pride 
 Let it go 
 Let me bless a flow my people 
 Here we go here we go here we here we yo 
 From the streets to beach 
 Flat lands to peace 
 To the freaks in the deeps drivin' by (beep beep) 
 To the heat meet the seat 
 To the cops from the beat 
 To the rich to sweet 
 To the poor to the weak 
 To the youth and the beast 
 HP 3rd Street 
 (3 x's) telegraph to the Av 
 North to the deep East 
 To the youth and the beast 
 HP 3rd Street 
 Telegraph to the Av 
 North to the deep East 
 This the way 
 In the Bay (in the Bay) 
 In the Bay [Repeat: x1]
