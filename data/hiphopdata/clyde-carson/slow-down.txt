I tell em 
 Slow down, you know you can't catch me 
 I move too fast on the gas, don't chase me 
 Slow down, slow down 
 I tell em 
 Slow down, you know you can't catch me 
 I move too fast on the gas, don't chase me 
 Slow down, slow down 
 (I tell 'em) 
 Ay, I'm on the case gettin' sideways 
 Dolla fo' five on the highway 
 You know a nigga state to state 
 On a dolo mission I got a date with the cake 
 Wide awoke, 3 A.M 
 Prolly touch down when the sun come in 
 Ay, when them guards hit the gate I be tired as fuck after that 8-hour race 
 I come from the land where we swing our cars 
 Figure 8 Benz concrete leave marks 
 Call it paid, super-charged 
 Back to back race the Benz with the four door Porsche 
 I'm tearin' up tires in this luxury 
 Hella smoke says she wanna fuck with me 
 Money on my mind ain't nothin' for free 
 Tryna keep up with me but it's nothin' to me 
 I tell em 
 Slow down, you know you can't catch me 
 I move too fast on the gas, don't chase me 
 Slow down, slow down 
 (I tell 'em) 
 Slow down, you know you can't catch me 
 Hype without fugitive, Snipes Wesley 
 Fuzz get on me tried to test me arrest me 
 Wet than a motha fucka whip like a jet ski 
 Ride like Presley, pills like Graceland 
 They wanna shit me the ready and off to reception 
 Nah, ain't tryna see the state pen 
 I'm black-scaled out in my Ray-Bans 
 Diamond-certified, I ain't neva lied 
 Ain't had L's since Pac died 
 Ridin' through the biters, couple bundles talkin' bout sliders 
 Run from the labours, mind's still swift 
 FedEx movement all on the bitch 
 Audi with the stash box, Cazzy too swift 
 No frontin' push a button give a nigga that, gift 
 I tell em 
 Slow down, you know you can't catch me 
 I move too fast on the gas, don't chase me 
 Slow down, slow down 
 I'm Jeff Gordon in his heyday 
 Ridin' like Tony Stewart smashin' through a two-way 
 Doin' 'bout a hundred kinda burnin' up the Louie 
 Louie, Louie 13th motha fucka yeah Louie 
 D.U.I. drivin' black henny on my lap 
 Pedal to the flo' with a 808 clap 
 Money motivated doin' sprints when I'm chasin' 
 And it gotta be a hemi I don't normally do the basic 
 Six-cylinder, r-really bruh? Slow it down, keep up 
 And I'm killin' ya, hope I'm not offendin' ya 
 See you at the finish line, leavin' em 
 Burn rubba, bu-burn rubba 
 This is how we do it when I'm dippin' on a corna 
 Burn rubba, bu-burn rubba 
 This is how we do it in Northern California
