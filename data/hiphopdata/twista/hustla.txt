 Rollin' with a pistol ?? In a room at the Ramada getting down in the streets 
 Hustlin hard takin' what you can get, but you steady reminiscing on 50,000 a week 
 A playa mode is about how to look good and different methods on how to cut that hoe 
 Hustle mode is if the cocaine cook good and different methods on how to cut that dough 
 Had to ? because it used to be cool you trusted him and now you gotta go to court 
 'Cause he gave you the money and when he drove off he called you and told you he was short 
 That's some shit that could've got you killed listen to it when the rap tunes real 
 Put the bitch on the plane with a couple of pounds that you can't smell cause its vacuum sealed 
 Take off a quarter then smoke in order they choke I cut it open they collapse from the scent 
 Pop it all off for 600 an ounce I'm get to smoke for free and get back what I spent 
 I gotta get it how I gotta get it even if I'm breakin down (dope) Break it down (slow) Take it down (oh)
