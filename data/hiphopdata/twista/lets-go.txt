(Royce Da 5'9") 
 Huh? 
 We the best, Twist' you at nigga c'mere 
 Sift ya lye 
 C'mere 
 Extremely hard to be the king of a city it's dis 
 A nigga that could twist like this 
 A nigga that could rip any shit that he get 
 Never balk and come with a metaphor like this 
 Flow like dis, never broke but flow for the dough like this 
 Never been a nigga that you know like dis 
 Cold like dis, but ah, it's just me and D-Mo like dis 
 Respect is a must, got every nigga in every hood checking for us 
 Never catch us catching the bus 
 Niggas got whips, niggas got loot, 
 Niggas got troops, got guns, got clips (what) 
 Next big thing, iced watch to go with the necklace ring 
 Iced out to go with the rest it seems 
 More or less the more of the best you seen 
 Big buzz, only rolling with big thugs 
 We get in clubs you know you getting ya shit bust 
 Not too many ducks is going against us 
 If ya don't know now, you'll know when ya lift up 
 Rhyme till I can't rhyme no more, ball till I can't ball no more 
 Till I'm 5'9" no more, till the ice can't shine no more 
 Which ever comes first, let's go nigga 
 (Chorus: x2 (Twista)) 
 Who the fuck want what?! 
 Who the fuck want what, want what?! 
 (Playa tell me why you hating, cause you the one take) 
 (That from a nigga that'll open you up) 
 (You gotta send the deck up when we holla) 
 (Royce Da 5'9") 
 One of a hundred niggas'll hate my shit 
 Eighty-nine'll bite, the other ten'll think of coming alike 
 'Cause my shit when it come to the mic, 99 outta 100'll like 
 Never disrespect a nigga gripping the tec, it's my shit 
 Put the flow in affect with my clique 
 Go to the death, flow the best, my spit, I'm sick, it's my shit 
 Try to get slick and niggas is getting hit 
 You don't want that do you? It comes back to you 
 And I ain't even trying to rap to you, so suck my dick, it's my shit 
 Too many willing to pin ya in rap 
 Put a ending to that, do the math with me 
 Straight to the lab, we're sending you back 
 Keep going, you know that no one can last wit me 
 Stay armed with the biggest of arms, got bitch-niggas hitting alarms 
 Every rhyme is strictly writing to harm 
 This my shit, keep every word of every verse in position to launch 
 Never gon' fail, never got plans of catching a L 
 I'ma forever prevail, whatever you yell 
 It's my world, everything else, c'mon nigga 
 (Royce) 
 Motown, 
 Chi-town 5'9 
 Twista, let's go nigga uh 
 (Twista) 
 Tell me who the fuck want what 
 What you murderous niggas is ready to make the deck go up? 
 I could cause a scene to make you throw up 
 Put a bullet in yo' gut, bat 'em down and leave the sto' cut 
 Cause homie you ain't got no choice ta, 
 That why you running to a real rider like Twista, or Roysta 
 Let the thirty caliber anoint ya 
 Whodie won't even know he hit till he feel his shirt suckin the moisture 
 Voice ya opinion if ya want to 
 Kick-ass winner, kick up dust in the middle of the arena 
 Subpoena motherfuckers like the courts do 
 We'll blast shortly ya nuts bust and it won't be a misdemeanor 
 We them niggas that'll come approach ya 
 Shocking ya body our Bacardi keeps all ya nerves from bleeding 
 Until we heard no breathing, two undercovers, 
 We coming we get the dirty even, they know it's serving season 
 Shit is good as gone, 'cause I gotta bring the goodies home 
 The petty packing penny brushing with the pretty pearl handle 
 Pistol, Pelle Pelle pants and the hoodie on 
 And you coming with the Midwest shit? 
 Remember how we took you, you tripping off how we did that shit 
 Somebody tell me where the weed at 
 Some niggas knew I was about to snap so he hid that shit 
 I was gon' get buck, come hard, get crunk 
 Go into a thing and let the rhyme ride, 
 And hit them niggas from the blindside 
 And take the whole opposition down with my dog 5'9 
 Ceremony for the killers, busting 'em off, 
 And coming off so you can bust yo' nut 
 Though I'm bout to bust yo' guts 
 But if yo' operation is hating, who the fuck want what?
