What happens when you combine the darkness with the light? 
 I'm bringing pain like two bad nurses 
 And the pain from these here, motherfuckin' verses 
 Ridiculous thirstses involving hearses to the dirt, shit 
 First picks and use 'n' autos to work with slugs to the shirt, shit 
 (Just to squirt shit) 
 A wicked hit with an expert kick and burst till the earth split 
 Leave you hurt bitch, show you how worser than worst 
 Get in the zone, see the vein when the pain repel 
 And then they closin' the curtains, bitch 
 (When adrenaline's pumpin') 
 I don't understand discussion, only hear certain shit 
 I'm a misunderstood nigga and I'm off my square high 
 Got me reversin' clips and dispersin' shit 
 What can I say to make you see how the fuck I feel 
 To make me wanna jump off of the edge 
 I'm charged off of suckers gettin' shot up off the ledge 
 No pain, instead of 'caine I took a blunt off to the head 
 (So tell me what it said) 
 Retaliate with lethal repercussion, I feel the reefer rushing 
 To go into thangs, like it's a wicked stick 
 Took the Benadryl, hot like I'm fin' ta steal 
 To get the kickin' shit for niggaz and bitches that I kick it with 
 I was born to get you pumped up 
 It's like some lead bust 'cause I give motherfuckers a head rush 
 Then yo' head bust when you jumped up 
 'Cause what I said must've got you geeked, my eyes red puffed 
 From smokin' shit that niggaz hit on to die 
 Make me wanna slip the clip on the side 
 And if you act like a bitch on the side 
 If we have to then the whole Westside'll 
 Let the shit go on and ride when the trigga bust 
 (Let your adrenaline rush) 
 Like when a motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump 
 To make his opposition chest kick up and jump 
 When you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uh 
 (Let your adrenaline rush) 
 Like when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump 
 To make a trigger pick up and dump 
 So turn the bass, kick up and bump 
 And let the rhythm hit off the trunk 
 (Let your adrenaline rush) 
 Like when a motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump 
 To make his opposition chest kick up and jump 
 When you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uh 
 (Let your adrenaline rush) 
 Like when a motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump 
 To make a trigger pick up and dump 
 So turn the bass, kick up and bump 
 And let the rhythm hit off the trunk 
 Pullin' up and bailin' out like we're carsick, I'm ready to start shit 
 Start up buryin' some heads like an ostrich 
 And unload the whole cartridge and throw the shells in the garbage 
 The hardest of motherfuckers could never achieve 
 What I've accomplished 
 Yungbuck's my accomplice 
 Located his existence with my sixth sense like a compass 
 And starting on a journey established to stop this 
 Rushing up the hearts of other niggaz to get 'em charged 
 What's the real reason? 
 All you haters try to murder me so now it's kill season 
 And even though I'm still bleedin' 
 I'm comin' after you 'cause I'm still breathin' 
 And y'all can't trace me 
 I bury my victims in the wall like Gacey, too lyrical 
 And since its nipple my umbilical these flows is critical 
 My music is miracle like I'm biblical 
 Killin' like I'm nuttier than buddy love 
 And still wouldn't leave a bloody glove and start the truck up 
 And speed the fuck up getaway smokin' this blunt 
 Dump the adrenaline eruptin' my veins I'm pumped up 
 And I'm calibrated at 360 degrees 
 See that's 300 niggaz that's gon die about 60 slugs to do this deed 
 (Psycho Drama) 
 We too much for the industrialistic fuck 
 With this on the brink of fuckin' up some shit 
 Dismantle, deduct some shit 
 It's hard to imagine what niggaz got nerves to do 
 (What niggaz got nerves to do) 
 So I guess I'll just take that fuckin' nerve from you 
 Then think what I'm on the verge to do 
 And I got the urge to ooh, let semi close yo curtains fool 
 From killin' the verses fool, I be one of the worstest dude 
 (You, the who?) 
 I'm the worstest workin' about 9 millimeters above your surface 
 Unleash these thangs then I defeat yo purpose, bitch you hurtin' 
 (Let your adrenaline rush) 
 Like when a motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump 
 To make his opposition chest kick up and jump 
 When you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uh 
 (Let your adrenaline rush) 
 Like when a motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump 
 To make a trigger pick up and dump 
 So turn the bass, kick up and bump 
 And let the rhythm hit off the trunk 
 (Let your adrenaline rush)
