(Tech N9ne) 
 Everybody got the memo, Michael Myers, man I'm mental 
 Messy murder monumental mixed my mind 
 Metamorphosis made it mainly my many maneuvers 
 Missin' my malice malevolent mister N9ne! 
 Mediocre motherfuckers my motive makin' minimum 
 Maniacal makin' me mesh my line 
 MONSTER! Musical massacre 
 Metaphysical minion may never match my grind 
 When I'm bustin' you think I'm poppin' the E 
 Hoppin' to Nina Boppin', need no stop and lockin' the B 
 Niggas be droppin' off in a coffin talkin' to me 
 Better flee, never see, Tecca Neez, I be forever 
 Look at the K.O.D. demolish, I'm polished 
 I get dollars, I get more guala, mixologist, and many I sell 
 You will never see the light of day right away 
 You will die but I hide away, say goodbye, (I'll see you in Hell) 
 True shots, a-who's stopped the crew's water? 
 You soft, I move rocks, a Mustafa 
 Boondock ya boo, So-Woo, what the? 
 Through chakras, you lost the new nana 
 Out with the weak and in with the raw 
 Put you in deep and have your mama seekin' the law 
 Freaking the beat, I get to peekin' 
 Leavin' you mauled with the saw 
 Ain't nobody beatin' me in a brawl 
 Y'all got to know, I stop the show 
 Pick you off of the pillar, you know I drop the foe 
 Sick of an abyss of sicker suckers, sock a ho 
 Nigga, oh, you ain't even in my optical 
 I'll shock ya though, I rock the flow 
 Nah, not so low like burnin' optimo 
 Wassup to Joe from my block, the MO 
 I did it to death 'n' my nigga I got to go! 
 It's a crisis and a murder whenever you see both of us in the booth 
 It can be an interpretation of a catastrophic event 
 Of verbal annihilation if you don't know the truth 
 It's a crisis and a murder whenever you see both of us in a rage 
 It can be an emergency, making you have to evacuate the premises, killing the audience up on the stage 
 We are an anomaly, coupling up and stomping them up in the gut 
 You gotta be loving the cut, if I get to fucking 'em up 
 I'm probably bustin' 'em up and vodka be up in the cup 
 And drama be nothing to us 
 A combination of some oddities coming to crush 
 And y'all will be nothin' to touch, your body, we cutting 'em up 
 Twista ready to bang and Tech got his face painted 
 Like we bout to go and do a robbery up in a truck 
 Whenever you recollect it, me and Tech will tackle niggas 
 And see 'em like Liam Neeson in Taken 
 Or Taken 2, better yet, Tekken 2 
 Wrecking you like I was Baek or Eddy 
 I'm ready to reappear like I was Yoshimitsu 
 From a darker side of the universe 
 You would verse a predator is what you didn't know 
 When they will go and get you 
 Then I'm immediately about to punish him, run, it's a mutation 
 Of horror that'll treat you like a ho and hit you 
 But Tech, me and you can speak on it, even type of terminology 
 And hurt 'em as if they didn't know we were an odyssey or an oddity 
 It's a murder probably, if not then I bet you that we cause a verbal lobotomy 
 Tell them niggas to make a move, then when I move, I wanna bruise 
 And show 'em they finna lose, and I refuse to be a fool 
 I kill 'em and keep it cool, but I'mma do what I'mma do 
 Because I'm breakin the rules, let's go 
 Bust you with lyrics, how we shoot this 
 Or either we gon' say "fuck you" while chucking up the deuces 
 The booth is where the living proof is, and I'm ruthless 
 I can leave your whole team's caduceus in nooses, ooh, it's 
 Somebody you don't really want to get into it with 
 I'm mythical, difficult and I don't know if it'll 
 Be a wise thing for you to do as far as tangling with the unusual 
 Orion, I'm iron, I'm scientifical 
 Indivisibility within the infrastructure of the family 
 That I created is inevitable 
 Especially if we committed to getting money 
 So fuck the haters because it's the paper that you better get, you 
 Take your mental into space and leave it alone 
 An outer dimension because I can get deep with a song 
 The look of a fiend, I'mma put 'em to sleep with the chrome 
 Unlock the machine, fuck him if he ain't breathing alone, die 
 It's a crisis and a murder whenever you see both of us in the booth 
 It can be an interpretation of a catastrophic event 
 Of verbal annihilation if you don't know the truth 
 It's a crisis and a murder whenever you see both of us in a rage 
 It can be an emergency, making you have to evacuate the premises, killing the audience up on the stage 
 We are an anomaly, coupling up and stomping them up in the gut 
 You gotta be loving the cut, if I get to fucking 'em up 
 I'm probably bustin' 'em up and vodka be up in the cup 
 And drama be nothing to us 
 A combination of some oddities coming to crush 
 And y'all will be nothin' to touch, your body, we cutting 'em up 
 Twista ready to bang and Tech got his face painted 
 Like we bout to go and do a robbery up in a truck
