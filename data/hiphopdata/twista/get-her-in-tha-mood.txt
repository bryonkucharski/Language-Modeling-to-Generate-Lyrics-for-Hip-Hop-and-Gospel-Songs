(Music Intro) 
 Since I'm blown let me flex this 
 If its somethin' on ya mind recline and check this 
 So smooth not reckless 
 We can get high and ride from Chi to Texas 
 Give the game up since I came up put my name up 
 Check out the rhythm 
 Make the mob wanna flame up 
 Struck a match or a lighta (lighter) 
 And listen to a young rida (rider) 
 On the side of Pimp double tril 
 Make you lighter than a feather in yo DOB hat 
 Bitch now listen can you solve that 
 I can tell you were the mob at 
 At the click cuttin' somethin' were the broads at 
 Thinkin' naw playa 
 Smokin' weed till it's all out 
 We can fall back 
 Shootin dice fo small scrap 
 Dre 4 watcha call that 
 Pull out my Georgia bows 
 And those that froze got caught by the po-pos 
 Headed for the 4 do (door) Bonneville 
 Flossin off behind the wheel 
 There's a pill 
 Took a chill 
 But I still had to pause 
 And if I pause 
 Its because I______

 With a playa like me and you 
 (Oh baby) 
 Can you smoke it riiight with a playa like me and you 
 See I'm 
 Laid back in my lex pumpin' game at two rats 
 And I rolled like two sacks 
 Ever since you were my homie 
 Came up 
 In the same truck 
 Full of drunk hunnies holla who that 
 Laid back it's a couple of hoes 
 Tryin' ta see were my head was at 
 Want some problems shit 
 Let's get busy wit the party shit 
 Were the blunts and Biccardi shit 
 But the way she was dressed 
 You might as well have nothin' on ya body bitch 
 Infrared on my side cause you know how hot it get 
 Messin with the proper cheese 
 To put what looks good on a proper chick 
 But really don't want the men and the fans to pimp block 
 Sposta (supposed to) last till these pimps cash them CCs 
 Heavy Gs 96 
 Strippin clips bout (about) nationally 
 Back seats and DOB hats 
 Havin' sex in drop tops 
 Now liquor on ya mouth and spot 
 Were we r.i.d.e.

 (Music Break) 
 I make my money on the DL 
 Close shop on the Pontiac Re-bell (rebail) 
 To the mall to ball 
 We all apart 
 Cause a brother gone floss in front of these females 
 To the retail 
 5 double 0 Periet 
 Double 0 d suits 
 Just to go with the boots 
 And I scoop 
 Up tha loot 
 Pay the cash 
 And dash past a lad while I'm in pursuit 
 Put my foot in motion 
 Exits (exit) the sto (store) 
 Wit my brand new gear 
 Spittin' game in her ear 
 Tell 'em if they please me I'm theirs 
 Tell her meet me here 
 Get a Digital camera 
 Girly had to rough 'em up 
 But Ima handle her 
 Like a man 
 Ima stand 
 If I fall 
 And when I fall 
 Then the serum gotta make the call 
 (This part goes really fast) 
 Let them all by the miniature clothes 
 I suppose I can dress 
 To impress these hoes 
 Gator shoes 
 Fresh gashed from head to toe 
 Only wearin in the do (door) 
 What thew playas know 
 Flossed out when they see me 
 Niggas wanna be me 
 Never woulda pimped free 
 Pimp costs 
 And I get lost on the slide 
 To the air 
 Gettin' high while we ride
