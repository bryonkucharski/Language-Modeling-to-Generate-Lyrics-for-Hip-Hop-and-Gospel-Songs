(Erika) 
 I'm callin ya daddy (daddy) 
 Can you be my daddy (daddy) 
 I need a daddy (daddy) 
 Won't you be my daddy (daddy) 
 Come and make it rain down on me 
 Come and make it rain down on me 
 Verse 1 (Twista) 
 Now come and kick it with the Twista 
 Black Caddy, Mack Daddy, 
 With a hoe up in the back seat 
 With the '97 pimp flow 
 Gotta feelin' when you smokin' 
 When I flip it to a track speed? 
 Talkin' about a beautiful figure 
 Astonishing as greek mythology 
 Body be just like a girl in uh... 
 What's that movie? nevermind 
 Let me enter your atmosphere 
 As you enter my world 
 And lemme touch that booty 
 I can't believe that your momma that cold 
 Her daughter got such an astonishing soul 
 You need a modeling role 
 Still a playa know you got it 
 When you climbin from the bottom 
 To the top of that pole 
 Cause you can pop and control 
 Your fatty's so accurate 
 When I'm smackin it 
 It's makin' me say 
 "What I gotta do to get with that?" 
 When it come to makin' it rain, 
 I can get it wet 
 When it come to cuttin' the monkey 
 I can get it wet 
 You gone see me to ya baby 
 You need a better man 
 Here come the politics, 
 I'ma be your weatherman 
 Cause every time I'm lookin' up 
 And I see more ass 
 I'ma constantly see 
 Rain in the forcast 
 This-a-way that-a-way 
 I'm flickin 5,000 ones 
 Or whatever you wanna call it 
 It's a celebration 
 You the champion 
 Here's the fetti confetti 
 Come on and get drunk 
 With the money hauler? 
 Chorus (Erika) 
 You done been good, 
 But you can do better 
 I done been wet, 
 But I can get wetter 
 Come and make it rain down on me 
 (x2) 
 Verse 2 (Twista) 
 But when I'm not for the feminine 
 And everybody that perceive with the hatred 
 I'ma teach them a lesson 
 I take shots of adrenneline 
 Cause that's the way I receive immunization 
 Against the recession 
 I got the muscle off my hustle and flow money 
 An entrepenuer with ways to get more money 
 So don't be trippin' whenever you see me throw money 
 Hah. It's just a little bit of show money 
 But if you want me to get it wet another ways 
 Then I'ma have to beat it up but first I'ma play with you girl 
 Touch your ears and your neck and play with your pearls 
 Then I reach up in your pants and play with you pearl? 
 When I lay you down you ain't gotta be frontin or fakin 
 On me baby 'cause I know it takes the right touch 
 I ain't stoppin' till you wet up the covers 
 Because I gotta keep on fuckin' till I see a lot of white stuff 
 Now you got me excited I can't hold it 
 I'm feelin' it coming I'm bout to let off an explosion 
 Let it ride when I see you animatin and shakin 
 When I touch your body you catchin convulsions 
 That's when I know I'm doin' what I'm supposed to 
 You chose me. I chose you. 
 Don't think I can get it wet? I told you 
 Come and let the Twist rain down on you
