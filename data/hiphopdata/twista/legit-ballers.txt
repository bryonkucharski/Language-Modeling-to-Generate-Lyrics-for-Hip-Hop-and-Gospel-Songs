(Twista) 
 Once again, another Trax productions 
 Rush for the 9-8, mobsta elites 
 Ain't it a shame how we make ballin' look so sweet 
 Especially when you ain't gotta hide your shit 
 You know what I'm sayin', you can just ball for free 
 Campaignin' your nation, in a legit demonstration 
 And gotta face incarceration 
 Eh yo, Liffy Stokes, let 'em know what's happenin' 
 (Liffy Stokes) 
 A nigga been hustlin' so long, God knows I've done so much wrong 
 I was 16 grown and holdin' chrome, servin' blows, we in' zones 
 My mom didn't understand me "Boy, you gon' die just like your daddy 
 From two to the head, dumped in the riverbed 
 I didn't to hurt you so badly," I was young and dumb 
 Fast life sprung of the money and hoes that it brung 
 Had a clip full of hollows to bring your momma sorrow 
 But now regret what I've done 
 Drama's all in the game whether gang bang or slang 
 I had to do my thang 
 When the shots rang, that's when it clicks in my brain 
 All the shit's the same 
 My nigga need a change, I had to get off out these streets 
 To get you out your seat 
 Flip a Trax beat, hit the crib and puff on a sweet 
 And let 'em feel something deep 
 Deep so the realest can feel 
 How I felt right before I bust that steel 
 Rappin' 'bout my life of skrill 
 And the everyday struggles of a nigga in the chill 
 Come on and take a little trip with a legit balla 
 Chi shot-callers (Shot up the chrome and let's swang) 
 Taggers wettin' up the walls. 
 (Some bitches in the back and a pocket full of scratch 
 Take a match and spark up a little bud and get blown away) 
 (Mayz) 
 This shit I've been tokin' is potent 
 Got me straight thinkin' about takin' Mary Jane and eloping 
 Blowin' smoke with the sunroof half-way opened 
 Countercode with the scope in close range 
 I guess he gotta aim, and stick a few thangs in the nigga's brain 
 No face straps (?) thinkin' that he can 
 Puttin' food on table is an everyday strain 
 But now I did finally flip my shit legit 
 And workin' a different angle of the game 
 Even though my hussle ain't changed 
 I'm still prayin' my best presence to overcome my pain 
 Singin' tapes of cain 
 The roads to riches seems longer than the freight train 
 And every little stop keep a nigga tryin' to plot 
 On the paper you done gain until you drain 
 But I put that on the foe 
 I'ma flow till I got no choice, or better yet no voice 
 But still by that time I hope to write enough rhymes 
 To own a fleet real estate with a Rolce Royce 
 Rollin' deep through this Chi-Town streets 
 With my mobsta elites on the way to North Riverside Mall 
 Givin' thanks to the all for givin' me a legit where to ball at 
 Keepin' shit tight for y'all 
 (Twista) 
 On the bus in disgust with an 
 eight ball 
 full of rocks in my pocket 
 Nickel sacks in the other 
 For po-pos who watch, can't stop, it's hot 
 But I gotta make a profit for my baby and my mother 
 Straight up hustler 
 What's the mental frame of mind 
 A nigga had to have the role 
 Be sold, or be poor up in these city streets 
 Or with the pistol playin' Mr. Repo 
 Fuck Deebo, I explode like C-4 so give me 50 feet 
 Bustin' shots in every direction 
 A nigga stoppin' my money from getting made 
 I done witnessed public aid, people get sprayed, the tip raise 
 And momma cry, "my bills can't get paid" 
 If I have to I'ma send cheese from blows 
 Nobody can hurt me I run with thugsta greed, GD's and foes 
 Workin' the spot 'cause we need some clothes 
 Who'd ever thought I'd be making money off of my CD's and shows 
 My crib got gats in the hall, rats steady crawl 
 Roaches comin' out the cracks in the wall 
 On the tip, bustin' with my back to the wall 
 Work my way up to an ounce, now I'm back to a 'ball 
 Now I'm spendin' stacks at the mall 
 Bendin' blocks on barbers hopin' my profits stack a bit taller 
 Twista AKA "The Bitch Caller", bringin' money to the mob 
 Just to be a pimp-shit talker
