I like to watch your body move when you're ridin' on top 
 On top, on top, on top, eh 
 I like to watch your body move when you're ridin' on top 
 On top, on top, on top 
 Movin' them hips, ride me ever so slowly 
 Actin' so grown and sexy, you know what I wanna see 
 I like to watch your body move when you're ridin' on top 
 On top, on top, on top, eh 
 Look at how she make it move like jelly, man 
 You know I gotta get a shot with a steady cam 
 You can have a brother coming out the pelle pants 
 If I gotta keep on looking at the way you belly dance 
 She got a cute portfolio 
 Fast like a NASCAR like she drove before 
 Because I can tell by the way she ride that stick 
 That she ride that dick like a rodeo, eh 
 On top while I'm huggin' them thighs 
 And you know I like looking at what I do see 
 I try to hit it from the bottom 
 But she told me to be real still 'cause she wanna do me 
 Like a gangster when I touch her 
 Thought I was rough, but she was rougher 
 She cut me, I didn't cut her 
 We tradin' places like Usher 
 She drop to the floor with an ease 
 Come and rock my boat like Aaliyah 
 If you can grind on me like Shakira 
 With you on top, then I just might see ya 
 He don't really know the way you can work 
 He said he ain't hit it good while he was at you 
 But you be givin' me the vision of a freak 
 So I gotta lay back, I wanna see what that do 'cause 
 I like to watch your body move when you're ridin' on top 
 On top, on top, on top, eh 
 I like to watch your body move when you're ridin' on top 
 On top, on top, on top 
 Movin' them hips, ride me ever so slowly 
 Actin' so grown and sexy, you know what I wanna see 
 I like to watch your body move when you're ridin' on top 
 On top, on top, on top, eh 
 I feel it how you bump and grind with the twist 
 Come and slide with the twist, if you ain't got plans 
 How you doin'? And I knew that she was ready 
 When I saw the way the fatty look in them black pants 
 And you know that I know would be good 
 When you be on top and giving me a lap dance 
 You move your body like a choreographer 
 I would lay down and watch if I got that chance 
 I would be owing you an apology for thinkin' I'ma be better 
 But I'm lovin' the way she rockin' me 
 Possibly I could be up in the Odyssey 
 For my good the bottom be when I let her get on top of me 
 I knew that she was hidin' a bumper when she got in the truck 
 I wanted to hit it after sippin' the yak in the cup 
 I like the way the booty look when she backin' it up 
 Come with me and let's get buck in the back of the bus 
 A good time, are you with that there? 
 Come and give it to me 'cause I gotta get that there 
 New beau was here, go and sit that there 
 Then pop this here, let me hit that there 
 So sexy, a vial of 5'8" 
 When she ride me, she make her body vibrate 
 When I'm looking at her, I never get irate 
 When she got on top of me and then gyrate 
 I like to watch your body move when you're ridin' on top 
 On top, on top, on top, eh 
 I like to watch your body move when you're ridin' on top 
 On top, on top, on top 
 Movin' them hips, ride me ever so slowly 
 Actin' so grown and sexy, you know what I wanna see 
 I like to watch your body move when you're ridin' on top 
 On top, on top, on top, eh
