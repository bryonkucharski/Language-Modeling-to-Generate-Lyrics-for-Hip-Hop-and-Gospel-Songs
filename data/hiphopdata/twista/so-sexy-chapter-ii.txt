 Do you want me to slow it down (Kelz) 
 Do you want me to speed it up (Twista) 
 Do you want me to slow it down (Kelz)

 You ain't neva heard a slow jam like this 
 You ain't neva had a remix like this 
 You ain't neva been freaky like this 
 Rollin' on 24's like this 
 Neva had a pool party like this 
 Neva sipped on cris much as this 
 Neva been to an island like this 
 Make one wish and I'll give you all this 
 (Twista:) 
 Girl you remind me of my jeep and my s5 
 First I was on top of you now you sayin' lets ride 
 Freakin yo body so good I give you wet thighs 
 When we get together you know we make the sex live 
 Take you to paradise while massaging you down 
 Feeling betta with twins ménagin you down 
 Make you explode and now I'm calming you down 
 So good that you don't want me to bother you now 
 Now listen here 
 Come and kick it with the players, ghetto majors and the thumpa sprayers. 
 And we neva got no room for no haters 
 When we pull up on them 24 omegas 
 While I'm smoking on a gar seeing Vega 
 You by my side we be on one when we hangin' 
 What earthquake say is wrong in a relationship 
 We a corporation lets take over the nation 
 Let me get up with you girl 
 Don't be trippin' on yo guy he gone be up when the heat come out 
 'Cause you could rub the lamp three times and still won't a muthafucka like me come out 
 You ain't neva heard a slow jam like this 
 You ain't neva had a remix like this 
 You ain't neva been freaky like this 
 Rollin' on 24's like this 
 Neva had a pool party like this 
 Neva sipped on cris much as this 
 Neva been to an island like this 
 Make one wish and I'll give you all this

 You ain't neva had a playa like me to take you shoppin' 
 Take you to the crib and sex you nonstop and 
 Bone thugs top droppin' 
 Vip with the bottles poppin' 
 So clean we gotta take a picture 
 So sexy I wanna get wit u 
 Girl I'll be singing thrilla 
 While you be squeezing pillows 
 And we can take a shower together 
 Get cozy in stormy weather 
 And if you ever going through something 
 I promise to make it betta 
 Ya just keep on lovin' a thug 
 Massage and some sex when I tell you its time 
 U ain't neva gotta want for nothing 
 As long as you down and you ready to ride 
 I wanna give you them butterflies 
 Have yo head all off up in da sky 
 And we be going (weo weo weo weo) 
 You ain't neva heard a slow jam like this 
 You ain't neva had a remix like this 
 You ain't neva been freaky like this 
 Rollin' on 24's like this

 U ain't neva rode in a Bentley lookin' like this 
 U ain't neva got up with a thug nigga like this 
 Or got with a balla that spit to the rhythm like this 
 Or kick it with a platinum plus nigga like this 
 Well looka here now come look at how the player T drop the top 
 Rollin' through flick and ma music bumpin on da trump train 
 Kelly and Twista peep how we rock the block 
 Platinum Ferrari it nothing shorty 
 U its chump change 
 Or pull up in the 7-4 to the fend (4 to the fend) 
 Won't you get in 
 While I'm steady blowin' smoke in the wind (smoke in the wind) 
 Hoping to win 
 Now speakin' words to my head in the bed 
 Then after we work then we can do it that one way 
 Lookin' thick as a loaf of bread by legs 
 And you get at shakin the way the twista make the tongue play 
 And this is for tha love and the ladies 
 The fine women that be rollin' Mercedes 
 Getting freaky and 
 And we be going (weo weo weo weo)
