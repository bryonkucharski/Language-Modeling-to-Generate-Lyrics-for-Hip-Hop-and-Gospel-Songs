I'm a beast, boy, with an intergalactic flow 
 Travellin' dimensions from another planet 
 But I spit that fly shit, though 
 That shit go, damn, that shit blow 
 Put me in a laboratory, I'mma cook, that's how shit go 
 Fendi, Prada, Enny 
 Inter-quantum physics 
 Alien and I done heard about the bitches on the Earth 
 So I think I'mma visit 
 Niggas coming at me acting like they hard 
 Yelling fuck me, fuck you, too 
 Don't get it twisted when I spit it scientific 
 'Cause the niggas that's with us do shoot 
 New coupe 
 Think you're messing with a dupe, fool, fool 
 Dark matter aka melanin 
 Outer space black power, Zulu! 
 Yelling out like Louie, yelling out moo-boo 
 Yelling out like Wayne, yelling out so-woo 
 'Cause I'mma wreck them 
 And I'm coming from a whole other spectrum 
 Tryna throw me in the flames, take away my name 
 Kick me out the game but I ain't gon' let 'em 
 It's a fascination with the science, my creation 
 I am God, look at how the way shit go 
 Take it to a whole 'nother motherfucking level 
 When I say I made that ho 
 I'm a beast, boy, with an intergalactic flow 
 Travellin' dimensions from another planet 
 But I spit that fly shit, though 
 That shit go, damn, that shit blow 
 Put me in a laboratory, I'mma cook, that's how shit go

 Travellin' dimensions from another planet 
 But I spit that fly shit, though 
 That shit go, damn, that shit blow

 In the beginning there was "Adam", A-T-O-M 
 I am the Higgs Boson, meaning that I was there way before him 
 I kick logic, science 
 Astrological when I be spitting you a verse 
 Feel like you prob'ly fucking with me, you the first 
 But in a parallel universe! 
 All up in my face 
 Oh, you think you something? 
 Atom's an almost empty space 
 So nigga, you ain't nothing 
 Telling everybody that's it's on, we can spray 
 I know that ain't you 
 The cells in your body got their own DNA 
 I know that ain't you... 
 With my adrenaline and venom I can turn 'em into a 
 Minimal amount of matter when in murder mode 
 Screwface, I am the Omnipotent of verbal evolution 
 Coming with some shit you've never heard before 
 Like genes, chromosomes, theories of existence 
 Ain't no tellin' where I take ya 
 Bio photons turning on codons 
 Activating divine nature!
