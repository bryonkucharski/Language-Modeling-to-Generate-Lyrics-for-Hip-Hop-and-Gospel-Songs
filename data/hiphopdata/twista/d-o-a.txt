Dead on arrival, swear to God I'mma kill 'em 
 As if I done put my hands on the Bible 
 Get 'em 'cause I'm liable to rock a motherfucker off 
 Especially if I get my hands on a rifle 
 Do the damn thang, not that they can stop a nigga 
 Pop a nigga off as if you were champagne 
 Put 'em in the ambulance but ain't no resuscitation 
 'Cause he done got knocked off, point-blank range 
 It's a crisis the way niggas will pull up and shoot 
 Last week, the streets just put him in a coupe 
 This week, the streets just put him in a suit 
 Six feet under with dirt on top of the roof 
 Put 'em in a grave, people standin' over your body 
 And they wonderin' if your soul'll be saved 
 Or if it has risen or if it will be forbidden, by the way 
 You was doin' shit, they could've put you in prison 
 Now you ain't with the livin' 
 Cause you weren't a shooter or didn't know how to shoot 
 Either way feel inferior, I make the block cripple 
 Comin' like a moshpit'll be the nigga knowin' if we 
 Bustin' Glocks, it'll put you up in a hospital 
 And when you on the way 
 And they get a look at the way that the bullets spray 
 Everybody about to know, that we don't play 
 Makin' sure that your body arrive D.O.A 
 Or dead on arrival... 
 Dead on arrival, soul all up on the block 
 I put some shots up in the head of a rival 
 Gun up on the passenger side of the vehicle, he hit you 
 With the artillery simply 'cause he didn't like you 
 Should've knew not to piss him off 
 Catch a disease of a gun cause it'll cough 
 Better watch your mouth if you see some grown folks 
 About higher pedigree, especially if it be a boss 
 These lil' niggas ain't playin' 
 Soon as you come up and start talkin' shit, then they sprayin' 
 (?Want you to ride in the whip, then they stand?) 
 Soon as they see the nigga hit, then they ran 
 Straight got ghost, they don't wanna [?] a nigga 
 That comin' at 'em ambitiously with the toast 
 Point-blank range if you let 'em too close 
 Scene of a homicide, body was lookin' gross 
 Prob'ly off with your head, if him in the scene 
 Was comin' to the war cryin' soft like [?] 
 And this ain't no Walking Dead, they get rid of you 
 If they dumped a body and a white chump might talk 
 No talkin' to the Feds, they hit 'em fast 
 Try to retaliate, but they gon' get his ass 
 And they ain't gon' be able to revive him in the ambulance 
 They just gon' pick him up and zip him in a bag 
 Dead on arrival
