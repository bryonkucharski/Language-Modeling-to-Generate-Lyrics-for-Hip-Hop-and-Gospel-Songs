(Feat. Darkside Ballaz) 
 I thank God that I found my piece of mind one more time 
 Since I'm dyin' I'd rather go right now than to be waitin' in line 
 (Repeat) 
 Play with mine you'll find that it's the wrong damn move 
 I was the wrong damn dude 
 Gino told me do the usual leave him in critical 
 My brother Bruce told me that he didn't pay dues 
 You snooze and lose 
 So what I'd do is make this man take a bath in his shoes 
 And it was all on the news 
 See I knew that it would be that me or him gonna bleed 
 And it wasn't gonna be me 
 So what I did was popped one up in my chamber and I sent 3 
 No women no kids 
 And I'ma shine on this nigga like Mop 'N Glo 
 You think he stopped and load 
 He jumped down with the rocks and a bomb on a dope 
 But he didn't have to be so bold 
 He rushed the Mob like a blob with the glocks and more 
 And even called the cops on Sko 
 He be shitty chi with the diamond in the watch in the coat 
 The medallion to match with the rope 
 No cars and the trucks in the cars that he ride 
 Lookin' like a star when he glide 
 I swear to God when he hear the bullet fall through the sky 
 He be jackin' like a rabbit tryin' to hide 
 Kinda hard to catch a nigga who be gone in the wind 
 Purple Navigator and a Benz 
 A new ??, the old niggaz that he used to fuck with 
 Took a fall for strength of a man 
 (Sko get it) before I step outside and do my job for Allah 
 Pray to Allah, undo Allah 
 Anythang go wrong I pray to Allah 
 Anythang go right I give my praise to Allah 
 Anythang in sight I'ma bless for Allah 
 Everythang tonight I'ma test for Allah 
 Everythang you write I'ma erase yo bar 
 If you ridin' tonight you better hop out yo car 
 Cause the moon tonight is traced in 5-star 
 I feel for ? my sisters at the bar 
 Y'all be aight just keep yo self to yo self 
 Y'all can see aight out on the streets it's double dare 
 Over there it's the end of the road East 99 find my kind 
 Still blind to the times and the signs 
 On the streets niggaz killin' elites 
 Killin' ?? 
 Killin' the chief 
 5 stars in the governor 
 Everybody gettin' covered up 
 Wrapped up in some bloody sheets 
 I came off the deep saw throw my heart 
 Niggaz slangin' a V with the L's on his way all the time 
 Since I'm dyin' then I'd rather go right now 
 Than to be waitin' in line 
 I can't seem to get away from all the things in the world that bring me down 
 And I can't seem to get away from all the pressures 
 And the pain that I find myself around 
 But I need a little more time for me to survive 
 All the dirty things that I did in my life 
 I can walk by I can try to crawl by I can run 
 But I cannot hide from my piece of mind 
 I hit him clean in the middle of his dentures 
 He was getting carried away because I let him slide 
 A couple times he went off on an adventure 
 Bloody murderer only to die it the Darkside 
 And god I like to for killin' over some Benjamins 
 But it wasn't about my money it was bout his pride 
 He had to run to the van he was defending it 
 In a line of duty he died for a piece of mind 
 I never knew I would have to murder the motherfucker 
 I was the one fighting and piecing and increasing the peace 
 I could (?) hit me and my brother 
 We was the reason for a record that CD release 
 We B.I.B. to the avenue about the trigger time 
 You can't be alive in the hood when we dirt ride 
 And motherfuckers got down cause never could 
 Never survive with the goods that god provide 
 So as I bogus wack him for doing my job 
 Eliminate niggas that hate 'cause they ruining the mob 
 I choose got bruise when I toss that guy out in the squad 
 While they flossing the cars we busting and turn into god
