Uh, uh 
 Where did she go, where did she go? 
 Security callin' me but I ain't ready to go 
 She pulled up to the telly in a Chrysler Concorde 
 Complimented her, told her she look nice in Tom Ford 
 Pulled out the six and told her let me get the digits 
 I'm giggin' in the city, come out tonight so we can kick it 
 Twista, 'mista-spit-it-fast', she can tell I do work 
 Only thing slow about me is the snail on my shirt 
 I don't even gotta wonder what a real woman is 
 When I look for the type, it is you 
 With her right on my side, on a mic, in a fight 
 For the night, then I might get with you 
 But now I'm leavin' the schemin' for any reason to stay 
 'Cause I feel like... 
 Fresh in the flesh, you a freshman at adolescence 
 Wanted to be with her but had to leave her 'cause you're a senior 
 High school sweetheart, can't believe you gon' be apart 
 Different colleges, why you gotta break my heart to get smart 
 Got 99 problems and this is definitely one 
 But somethin's stoppin' me from thinkin' our legacy is done 
 I feel our breakup's inappropriate, I want you and I meant it 
 We gon' figure somethin' out though our parents is against it 
 Say that I'm not gon' be successful, but I still won if it's stressful 
 Thinkin' about how I can't get that or you wonderin' if I left you 
 I ain't gon' be the one talkin' about I should've kept you 
 I ain't gon' be the one wonderin' how that shit affect you 
 Come up with a way to get you back 
 Workin' on the plot, plan 
 Method on my mind 
 She one of a kind 
 When I'm lookin' for the one to love 
 She the one I wanna find 
 So I gotta search 
 When we get back together, you gotta stay 
 My future, but for today 
 You're the one that got away...
