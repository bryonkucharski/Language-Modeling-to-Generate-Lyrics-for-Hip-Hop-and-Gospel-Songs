 And the BDs, Bridge Kings and Stones and two six box o's and oh

 Too much weight on my shoulders niggas just dream and die 
 So we gotsta pull an extra seed for the one's who tried 
 (Twista) 
 In the 'lac on dubs pay the valleys and I got in club 
 In da back of the club with a strap in the club 
 And a sack for the thugs and some ex for the bitches making sex delicious 
 Tax for the riches is the balls on my tattoo's suspicious-
