(Chris Swagg) 
 Black on my gloves, black on my hoodie 
 I got it on me for any pussy nigga that push me 
 If I want it, I take it, angel of Satan 
 I'm a hitter for hitters, just know that Jesus was waiting 
 Black on my gloves, black on my mask 
 It's a funeral, nigga, that's on the gas 
 Life, I'mma take it, angel of Satan 
 I'm a hitter for hitters, just know that Jesus was waiting 
 Far from a angel, more like a devil 
 Black SUVs, heavy metal, got my foot on the pedal 
 Murdering you right where you stand if I ever catch you 
 I can fill your back up with shells from this .38 special 
 Won't stop till I murder every rapper, I'm finna replenish 
 Went through a killing spree for years and I never repented 
 Father, forgive me, I sinned and have no problem admitting 
 I'm like God to these bitches, my only problem's a mitten 
 Got black on my gloves, black on my mask 
 Shoot every hit, miss and I'm coming back on yo' ass 
 I won't hold back, I'mma blow and knock you flat on yo' ass 
 My lil' niggas'll blow and they ride for the cash 
 I'm a hitter for hitters, I sold my soul to the streets 
 These motherfuckers thought I sold my soul to the beast 
 Don't give a fuck about the murder rate, I'll help it increase 
 I got the realer gorilla shit embedded in me 
 If I should die right now, I pray my dark soul you can keep 
 'Cause I'm corrupted, I hang with killers, gangstas, elites 
 I'm up in this bitch wildin' for Chiraq, what you think? 
 I catch him in traffic, wreck it and rock him to sleep

 It's a funeral, nigga, that's on the gas 
 Life, I'mma take it, angel of Satan 
 I'm a hitter for hitters, just know that Jesus was waiting 
 Fresh off the corner where niggas hustle and kick it 
 Politicking with gangstas and fucking with bitches 
 But never lock and try me, the shit'll get different 
 They know that I keep it on me and God as my witness 
 I been the business, why they think I'm holding the torch 
 I was only 12 or 13 when I first rapped on the porch 
 Battling niggas up in the park, I wasn't playing no sports 
 Man, I wanted the whole thing, I wasn't taking no shorts 
 I call up the guys, and we take a ride 
 If we catch you lacking, nigga, then we getting fire 
 'Cause we tryna rock you, don't wanna see you alive 
 If we slide up on him, Swiss cheese him, he won't survive 
 I'm telling you niggas ain't ready, bitch, any nigga could get it 
 Money, power and pussy, yes, that's my religion 
 Proper preparation prevents poor performance in winning 
 I'm from where them niggas ain't hungry but they stay in the kitchen 
 I tell they mama to pray, look, bitch, I'm God 
 I know I sinned in the past but I beat the odds 
 I put in work, I did it for squad 
 Forever, I'm cursed, I done been hit from the mob
