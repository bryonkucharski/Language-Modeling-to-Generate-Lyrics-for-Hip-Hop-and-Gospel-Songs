I be the grossest, nigga spitting dirt about the hood, 
 Then that go with the flow that's ferocious 
 Kill 'em off with the minimal dosage, 
 You don't wanna see the result of my ultimatum when I focus 
 And I got the streets on lock, 
 Muthafuckas feast on Twist like they feast on Pac, . 
 I'm a beast and the beats don't stop 
 Twista and the Legendary Traxter and we so hot 
 Kill 'em off if we ever get into it in a minute 
 I'mma murder 'em and put 'em in a body like ain't nothing they can do about it 
 Dump 'em in the streets you'll never know it was get money that was in the controversy 'cause I off whoever knew about it 
 Take it up another level when I'm off of tropical, the reason I went overdosing off my mentality 
 Phys-I-cally I be from the inner city yeah the Windy City 
 But I'm spiritually from another galaxy 
 And I be... one of them... niggas that... never do... give a fuck... what you say as long as Ima get 'em up 
 Witness that I fly, look at the way I kick back, niggas in the Chi guest you can say I spit that 
 Devin Hester, D. Rose, never see me at a show with cheap clothes, 
 Take over the game no cheat code 
 I'ma ball like Shaq no free throws, I'm on... 
 When it be coming to this rap shit I'm top shotta 
 Midwest godfather, hotter than the city like Bambaataa 
 And I'ma damn problem, a speedknot mobsta 
 Blowing on the top ganja 
 Everything I wear cost top dollar 
 If your on what I'm on come fuck with me 
 If your about getting money come fuck with me 
 If you blowing on loud come fuck with me 
 If you need a new style come fuck with me 
 I am the Higgs' boson 
 Blast and the raft lance vic with voltons 
 Come on write that over more gigs and role bombs 
 Make you have to hold your kids in your arms 
 Got you the remedy we stand the test of time like ima the statue of liberty 
 And ima bringing the raft of my enemy and I am immortal when I'm in a portal 
 Full of math than chemistry 
 Telling you that ima get 'em when I see you coming with the rhetoric 
 That let me know that you want to get annihilated 
 I am at the pinnacle when on the beat I leave a enemy at the back of me and anybody violated 
 Put 'em at the bottom of the barrel ima animal I kill 'em with the ammunition 
 There ain't gonna be no murdering me 
 Coming to the surfaces of the earth ain't no purposes in rukus, worth of a person holding hundred million money for me 
 Protons, neutrons, electrons 
 Building blocks to a decepticon 
 You just met with tron 
 Don't upset lebron 
 Kobe Wan Kenobi 
 Left hand ima black ginobili 
 Shoot 'em no more monetarily death and holy matrimony 
 Shit on muthafuckas if I ever catch 'em acting phony 
 When it be coming to this rap shit I'm top shotta 
 Mid-west god father, hotter in the city like bambaataa 
 And ima damn problem, a speedknot mobstaz 
 Blowing on the top ganja 
 Everything I wear cost top Doller 
 If your on what I'm on come fuck with me 
 If your about getting money come fuck with me 
 If you blowing on loud come fuck with me 
 If you need a new style come fuck with me
