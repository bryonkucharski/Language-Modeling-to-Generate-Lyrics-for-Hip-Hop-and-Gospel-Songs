(Tung Twista) 
 Back to school lets go back to school 
 Lets go lets go back to school to the oldschool 
 Lets go back to school to the old school 
 To the times when the single file lines was the rule 
 To the days that we had to study all the maps 
 The days we were kiddin not to take the kid naps 
 The days when we used to have to wear the dunce caps 
 And the days when we used to bust the oldschool raps 
 Sittin' with your buddy studyin for ya test 
 Lookin' back so that you see up under betty's dress 
 Couldn't wait for bells to ring so we can go to recess 
 To kick the battle rhymes just to see who was the best 
 There were seven emcee's in the 7th grade 
 I would kick seven rhymes had only seven made 
 But those seven rhymes we stole 
 Note the way your toning 
 I gave the class a blast the way I smash my opponents 
 Battlin was serious they've all ducked the fist 
 Because I kick the funky fresh rhymes like fish 
 Try to swing but they miss they miss like this 
 Rasheeda's on the monkey bars blowin' me a kiss 
 Throwin' rhymes back and forth on the see saw 
 Just to mess with him because I know that he saw 
 Winkin at Latrice because I know that she saw 
 Several suckas tried to push us down but we saw 
 These are the days when the tongue used to rule 
 Recess is over lets go back to school 
 Goin' back to school like Rodney Dangerfield 
 To the lunchroom where the cooks arrange a meal 
 Ate the sloppy joe where my friends copy so 
 We can try to get more than emcees can flow 
 The fun fun fun funky able fable 
 I stake the style standin on the stable lunch table 
 Finish up the rhyme so I can pass it to the next 
 Throw 'em back and forth till we heard the bells flex 
 Left the lunchroom went to the gymnasium 
 Ut time to flow we call it a rap stadium 
 Throwin' rhymes back and forth like a symphany 
 I wanna start a battle so step to him for me 
 The whylin got sensible because we saw the principal 
 Like grammar school somehow the principal's invicible 
 Shot a couple hoops the rims are called fruit loops 
 And if you miss we say opps and leave the gym like troops 
 Single file line but we were still at the pool 
 The day is over tomorrow back to school 
 After school I'm home with my mom she's pleased 
 'Cause rappin' help me learn there were never F's and D's 
 'Cause when I'm spellin bees it would help me stand these 
 Didn't worry about freaks on the street sellin keys 
 Rock the streets beats from the mouth no tracks 
 Rhymes be simple bust on how they ain't wack 
 I walk into a battle say what we havin' here 
 Back in them days I was called a cavalier 
 Me and baby used to flow the flows like food 
 Me and James Phillips used to rock the high schools 
 Me and Carl Tolta used to rock the neighborhood 
 Don and Aviator used to show that they were good 
 Me and Johnny Love used to rock the rock parties 
 And my brother Johnny kicks a dance to fade everybody 
 Me and kingdom rock used to rock the south blocks 
 An empire of destruction had emcees on their jocks 
 The past I have stated, they way we used to rule 
 Even though we graduated lets go back to school
