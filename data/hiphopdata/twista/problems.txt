 Problems upset you 
 (Verse 1: Twista) 
 When I'm on the track you will see accuracy 
 Actually I know that you will see I come like I got the fully 
 Automatic for the sent aggression of the problematic and negativity or whoever caused the static 
 Pick up a rose and sniff a scent if if you think it's magnificent 
 Stop the stressin or just catch a blessin if it 
 If it's bills or if it's rent some of us worry some of us don't that's why everybody so different 
 The only answer to you problems solve em 
 Stallin is the only thing that can stop a balla 
 Though world is full of hatred face it 
 Get out the matrix and let's get back to the basics 
 Instead of being individual let's practice a ritual and be an indivisible when it's critical 
 So every time that some drama hit yo doorstep 
 Gotta try to keep your composure and don't let 
 Problems (Don't let) 
 Problems (You can't let) 
 Problems (You won't let) 
 Problems upset you 
 (Verse 2: Tech N9ne) 
 I'm a problem because I'm different and people don't get it 
 When I be the clown like a sucka down when I be kickin' my music 
 Tech is dangerous if you think you can hang with us 
 Sick in your brain with it when I mangle it know that I break and abuse it 
 Have you prayin' to God 
 'Cause what I'm sprayin it's odd 
 And I'm slayin this broad 
 Tech Nina's layin his ride 
 I'm insatiable when it comes to be makin' this gouda 
 I'm a sniper killa murderer look out I'm a shoota 
 A dilema we takin' out you beginners comin' to my psycho cinema 
 It's a must that I crush them 
 If you accustomed to lovey dovey movies 
 Then you unlucky because they call me Tecca Nina the snuff film 
 Throwing the fist up 
 Cause all of my grips up 
 People was hating but now they zippin their lips up 
 Neva debated you imitated get ripped up 
 Stuck off in Necropolis cause Tecca Nina and Twista's a 
 Problems (Don't let)

 Problems upset you 
 (Verse 3: Twista) 
 My alien complex can get as lethal as bomb threats 
 When I put together patterns and concepts 
 But when it come to dealin' with pain and problems and relationships I ain't gonna lie I ain't the bomb yet 
 What do we need, what's the resolution 
 It's the restitution or just retribution let's just start a revolution 
 But wait, I'm hesitant because in fact 
 How can I fight to be equal if the president is black and a 
 A Chi Town resident at that 
 Hope we focus on this instead of wars in Iraq 
 The future is bright or will it be weary 
 Do I need to pay attention to conspiracy theories 
 Is the government systematically destroyin the population for the progress of world domination 
 Smile, even if the landlord callin 
 [? ] But that the least of your problems 
 Problems (Don't let) 
 Problems (You can't let) 
 Problems (You won't let) 
 Problems upset you 
 Try not to get worried 
 Try not turn on to 
 Problems that upset you 
 Don't you know
