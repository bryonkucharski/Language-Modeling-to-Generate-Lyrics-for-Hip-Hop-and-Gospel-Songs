2000 
 No mothafuckin mercy for tha new millennium 
 It's Victory or Death 
 I'm tha Twista in this bitch 
 Mothafuckaz talkin' 'bout styles and shit 
 And who bit what and who made what 
 Nigga fuck all y'all styles 
 I'm finna set this shit off like this here 
 Chitowns murderous mob gothic 
 Hard knock it give me tha mothafuckin ammunition I'll cock it 
 Respected like I'm one of Gods prophets 
 Gotta put it down for legit ballaz and you don't think 
 That I'll rock it annihilate that nigga 
 'Cause like a lamb I was sacrificed for this verbal murder religion 
 Imprisioned by my hunger to succeed 
 By the heart I be driven 
 No shakin, no shiverin, get your shit to bleed 
 Reciting street literature, shall I spit tha creed 
 Now who them mothafuckaz talkin' 'bout bitin 
 Go get me the pump-out of my trunk-I'm finna buss 
 Y'all better run punk 
 Fuck where you got your style from I be the one 
 Rippin the track and I'm murderin 
 I'm in the middle of killin' 'em off when the guns dump 
 With a young pump two to the brain don't even harm me 
 You fuckin' every party, you won't even startle 
 You' the harder crew of lyrical giants 
 Turnin' mothafuckaz like you to microscopic particles 
 To hype, to stop it the modules on cruise control 
 Ride out on these niggas-bitches-ho's 
 Ain't takin' no titles I instantly bruise your soul 
 Talkin' that shit to me- trigger vicious flows 
 Get to rippin my clothes and start snappin like I'm 
 Sniffin shit up the nose, and catchin convulsions 
 Till I'm trembling no surrendering start shootin and 
 Knockin' mothafuckaz out like Benalyn 
 Reminiscin' on that adrenaline 
 Oh, now you rememberin 
 Overdose 'em on poisonous poetry from the west to the wild y'all 
 Gangbagin like Gotti, rockin' tha party 
 Straight up shockin your body doin' it Kami Kaze style y'all 
 'Cause it's Victory or Death nigga, better stay out the way 
 When my adrenaline pumpin or you can get a..(click-clock-blast) 
 Die mothafucka die! 
 Ain't no makin' me bleed 'cause I've got family to feed 
 (Repeat) 
 Its victory or death nigga 
 I would rather die before I can't prosper I'm a mobsta 
 Won't stop ballin, because it's meant to be, 
 It's Victory or Death I gotta hustle till I'm gone 
 (Repeat) 
 To all the folks and the lords. 
 The bloods and the crips and every ward lets roll 
 You gotta go- for what you know 
 If it's retaliation get low 
 When you get to the calico let it flow 
 Make these niggaz know in the door 
 Make a mothafucka bleed for what you need 
 'Cause the familys gotta eat in the last days it's hatred and greed 
 Luv to the Gov's, B.M.'s, Field marshals, elites and the chief 
 Soldiers we better take heed and realize 
 Signs of the times, stand by yo 9, 
 Watch out for tha haters and write yo' rhymes 
 But the industry is set up to fuck you so you better be on the grind 
 Don't be one of the blind gotta stay alert 
 And put in work 'cause time is almost up 
 Twistas, Hurricanes, and Volcanoes erupt 
 So we can't stop the struggle, 
 I'm killin' my enemy, breakin 'em off and not givin' a fuck. 
 And I pray to the Lord my soul to keep 
 When I go to the sky 
 Thank you from savin' me form a torturous life of hell, 
 But hile I'm here I'm straight legit ballin until I die 
 Lets better these years, feel the blood sweat and the tears 
 Organize, I'll sit back and smoke a Philly witcha 
 Never scared of my peers, I only got federal fears 
 And I'm known to put it down for my city nigga 
 And when we get full of this indo 
 Hydroponics and Chronic lock up ya doors and tha window 
 Better go and call up your kinfolks 
 Cause the riders that's down with this mob 
 Will murder when the wind blow 
 Don't know what you info 
 We bring terror in this Apocalyptic era of Armageddon we headin in 
 And the only way we can survive is if we come hard 
 And strive to be gods instead of men!
