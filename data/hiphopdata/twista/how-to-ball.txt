 Smokin' on that best buy feelin' superfly ridin' high throughout the chi 
 Duckin' them guys on the rise watchin' DVD's on my car TV's 
 Makin' bitches freeze stop and do a 360 degrees 
 While I'm in the breeze my mind's at ease smokin' on trees 
 Contemplatin' monopolies through these rapid keys 
 It's all for the skeeze so bitch please I need a V-12 
 And a gang of dro and island walkin' on seashells 
 And if's all well in my life givin' up thanks everynight 
 But my strength and my will to still fight

 Fucked up steady callin earl

 (Twista) 
 All the thugs in the world let me hear you holla out I got that raw 
 All the killas and the ballaz if you wit let me hear holla back wit a fuck the law 
 All the niggas and the bitches in the club 
 Let me see you throw yo nines up to the ceilin' 
 All the stick-em niggas in the party 
 Catch them muthafuckers up as soon as they leave the buildin' 
 If you ready and willin' then uh set you down 
 With the mob and let me see you throw a knuckle up 
 Have you hustle up if you comin' betta buckle up 
 'Cause I ride like what the fuck? 
 Now what the fuck is up 
 Rollin' on rims we bout to die 
 22's with enough clean smokin' much green 
 While the ho's watch a fuck scene on the TV's with a touch screen 
 Run a three for twenty-five's on a two for fifteen's 
 On a eight dollar hollas the mob figgas make a lot of dolla's 
 Pay for the repo can't take my Impala pop da colla 
 But in the club they sho gone hate us 
 All the ho's don't play us 
 While we sportin' froze on gators 
 With a dye half-broke like the ozone layers 
 Tell me where the DJ 
 Where the dro where the drank 
 Gotta get be ?yappy ho's pappy? happy 
 'Cause I'm off that dank 
 On the path of destruction I'm hustlin' 
 While I gots to get that bank 
 Never bogus at all 
 Pacs and techs in the hall 
 Gettin' money with my dogs 
 And I'm never actin' petty with the fedi if ya ready let me... 
 (Hook 1 & 2 till end)
