(Featuring Tung Twista) 
 Now for some typical reason 
 I'm rollin' up some hoes and pattin my back seat hah 
 My pimpin' lyrical tactics is like a dirty kid flippin on a mattress 
 Now flex this 
 Verse One: Tung Twista 
 Now I just be 
 On the front porch with a torch ready to scorch 
 Two women peepin me cause really I'm gone 
 In the zone they havin' thoughts of freakin me 
 Keepin' me company bumpin me for the privacy I'm on 
 They can see I'm a cool muhfucka kickin the petty 
 Down with a tango on my razor fade 
 Peanut butter complexion to silly processions 
 Of bitties a fifty sack got some reefers and a razor blade 
 Like a game of Spades, crack the bullshit 
 These days was made for me to devise strictly games that paid 
 Women freakin me greedy lickin' me doin' body graffiti 
 Throwin' they panties up on the stage, are you up on the age? 
 Two players in the Chi, you're thinkin' Do Or Die 
 You and I can be naked 'cause I'm the love that you've been thinkin' of 
 The style of flow is a vocal calico 
 To show you with the mic I be speakin' love, what's the words, weak and 
 Numb 
 Go to my crib, no need to bring a mask and glock 
 Try not to pass the block, gettin' more hot than the astronauts 
 Sippin After Shock 
 I ball 'cause I see you all on Rap-a-Lot 
 Let's get parley and then crack the spot 
 Plenty Henny for my crew and I ain't even broke up half a knot 
 Keep on holdin' me while I roll to be we can smoke or ride 
 And you can play with me to keep the passion hot 
 Don't you know how the money flow 
 Don't you know, how the money flow 
 Don't you know, how the money flow 
 Verse Two: Belo 
 Mmmm, now they peep a brother Rolex 
 Try and get race car, heavy on the skin tech 
 Money clean like Windex 
 Givin' up the ave like a brother gonna pass, but the hoe check 
 Hoe flex I'm on the avenue, lay it back sip a half a brew 
 So I see if I can have a fruit 
 A peep show like the hoe when she thinkin' 'bout me havin' you 
 She laughin' too, and pass a few, beads around 
 Smokin' trees till the leaves come down 
 She be clothed ain't a skeezer now, show 'em the paper 
 That be caught up at your crib with your pantses down 
 But money maker want a triple take 
 Look at the nigga with the endless dividends of heavyweight 
 See him ridin' in the see-A, D-I, double-L, A-see 
 Always checkin' paper in tall ways 
 Pull 'em off the sprawlways 
 Herd a couple hoes in clothes and I'm supposed to be all day 
 Parley parley, dog that's how the money flow 
 Don't you know, how the money flow 
 Don't you know, how we do it in the 'O 
 Don't you know 
 Verse Three: AK-47 
 Bend the block with the indo, blowin' out my window 
 Rolex on my side do', lean back in the slow flow 
 Gettin' paid as the night go 
 I see some fly hoe, tell me where you crib at 
 Where's the place that you live at? 
 Hit you on the phone till you be all alone 
 So we can get it on baby just kick back 
 Swiggin brews and Perrier 
 Thick chick with a booty like a plizayer do 
 AK (to where) to the pen 
 And to tell all my niggaz to keep it strong 
 They ain't got long (to what) to see 
 Where the niggaz is kick it where a nigga kick it 
 Go where I go Cadillac to the show 
 Po Pimp fuck the dough hit the stage and become wicked 
 Get the money and ride out, go back to the hideout 
 Take a woman to the bed and spread them thighs out 
 I'ma pull my surprise out 
 Then my boys was flyin out, but two girls were chasin 
 Deep in Chicago, been doin' this since the nine-oh 
 Comin' up put a number on fryin hoes 
 Let the money flow 
 Don't you know, how the money flow 
 Don't you know, how the money flow 
 Don't you know, how the money flow 
 Don't you know, how we do it in the 'O 
 Verse Four: Nard 
 Now for some typical reason I'm rollin' up with a hoe 
 And I'm pattin my back seat 
 I pimp lyrical tactics like a dirty kid flippin on a mat 
 Never could I come flexless, when I wreck shit 
 Then be dip through the Chi and enjoy my Lexus 
 Better blow when you bob your head, to the fed shit 
 Why you waitin for the next kid, motherfucker 
 Makin' money just wanted to take a little get the dick wet 
 Get my girl in bed 
 Spend my money in the Southern, motherfuckers 
 That's thuggerin, but I'ma come from the heart for start 
 To stop all the niggaz the bigger the trigger the larger the dividends 
 Pimpin' and paperin leavin' sugar in 
 Till money flow like a dreamland 
 But really though, could you tell me how the money flow? 
 Don't you know, how the money flow 
 Don't you know, how we do it in the 'O 
 Don't you know, how the money flow 
 Don't you know, how we do it in the 'O
