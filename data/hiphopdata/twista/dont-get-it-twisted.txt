 Oh yeah, yo boy Twista

 The midwest, westcoast connection (westcoast) 
 And this is how we puttin' it down you know what I'm talkin' about 
 A lil' somethin' for tha ladies 
 It's not love, don't get it twisted 
 I'll make you feel so good but you gotta slow down

 Ill make you wanna do it all night, all night 
 X2 
 Mr.Capone E: 
 It's not love comin' from a straight thug 
 All up in the club lookin' pretty when I'm buzzed 
 That's what it was, that was love 
 So lady here I come so pass me the bud 
 Gettin' you all sprung off the tongue

 And one by one and I'm checkin' out your rump 
 And oh yes Mr.Capon double E

 Hit and quit it, are you wit it? let just keep this little secret 
 But don't catch no feelings when you squealin'

 Twista: 
 Today I was rollin' in the mac with the shorty 
 But now I gotta go and catch me a hottie 
 Chillin' in the club up in the v.i.p 
 Now I'm after your body in the after party 
 Would a jigga be up here gettin' love 
 Get a girl to back it up, spend the stack for the buzz 
 Give a one night stand shorty tell me where you're actin' 
 The love in the back of the club you gonna get up in a bentley 
 With a bum well let me take you to a tele where the hatas 
 Can't get me hit the ass tryin' to titis now give a little to the 
 Homie Frank Nity and get it now give it to Mr.Capone E, 
 And well talk about, its only me get the dawn with a G 
 Imma never leave you lonely gotchu all in a pony, come 
 And give me that there like the way I pull your hair, 
 Spankin your little dairiere makin' you scream 'ouch' 
 Give it to you when we fucking on the couch give it to you 
 When we fucking on the chair look at little mama sweatin 
 Good, gettin' rocked by the balls gotta hit it hard, not too 
 Soft never get it twisted cause you fucking with the pistol 
 When I pop you off imma drop you off it's not love 
 It's not love, don't get it twisted 
 Ill make you feel so good but you gotta slow down 
 It's not love, don't get it twisted 
 Ill make you wanna do it all night, all night 
 Mr.Capone E: 
 I Wanna make you do it all night long. Play it again just sing this 
 Song westcoast, midwest, dirty south, eastcoast ladies just drop that thong. Let's get it on, pull the alarm as playa with that Thug life 
 Passion I keep on asking, reminding just a onenight 
 Standding. No matter my company but baby pay a glase and if 
 You got that little chance mija lets runway. Anyways all day by the 
 Way I gots to leave in a rush a quit nut don't you fuss all I did 
 Was just fuck.
