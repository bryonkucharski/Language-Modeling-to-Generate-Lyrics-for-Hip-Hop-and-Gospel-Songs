 My Adidas, in my Adidas, in my Adidas, I'm thugging 
 My Adidas, in my Adidas, in my Adidas

 Never less than the best, that's Gucci, Fendi, on my body cas 
 Blowing old good kush, let it take me somewhere 
 Probably mardi gras 
 In the club bitches kissing all on me 
 Like it's Mardi Gras 
 In my Adidas 
 When I'm stepping out of them cars 
 3 road already and in with a bad bitch 
 And my outfit probably hard 
 On the west coast I'm a og 
 On the east coast I be God 
 You should scared of me 
 'Cause I'm so fly when I be in my Jeremy Scott 
 Blowing out of jobs 
 In my Audi cars 
 Run DMC no shoe strings hit 'em with a swag like molly mar 
 Got a pair with me everywhere I go 
 'Cause if I don't I go hard 
 When you see me I'm stunting 
 Outfit popping because I'm in my 
 My Adidas, in my Adidas, in my Adidas 
 Hoppin out the phantom, looking clean

 All these ladies beat up on me in my Adidas 
 Nothing but the freshest whips my foreign car garage 
 Take a look at the regiment that I go through 
 When I give when I'm dressing up 
 Pants laid on behind tucked on my Adidas looking fresh as fuck 
 They don't measure up when I cut them clothes 
 Like a margarine through and I 
 Spin in my Adidas like Derek Rose 
 Show swag on 'em haters when I play with it 
 Strike on my favorite pose 
 So exclusive no matter where you look and the way to get those 
 Wings in the back I'm hopping the air so whenever I see her, I see her 
 If a mama got on that leopard print I'ma holla in my cheetah Adidas 
 'Cause I'm that fly look down when you snap by 
 Spazz by 'cause I'm off one 
 And I'm turked up and lookin' fresh in my
