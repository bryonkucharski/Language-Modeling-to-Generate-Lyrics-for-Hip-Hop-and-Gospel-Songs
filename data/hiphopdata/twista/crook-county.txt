In the Chi, it's kill or be killed, hussle or die 
 You gotsta take the pie, momma didn't lie 
 Look in my eyes you see the realness, the nine makes you feel this 
 The pain that I'm going through 'til I'm sitting on millions 
 My minds on that paper, wishin' upon a caper 
 I need to stack now, I will pay for my sins later 
 When I'm living greater, the mind state of a Westside native 
 It's sick in the head, dodgin' Feds everyday 
 See me load the AK, watch 'em run when we spray 
 Get the fuck up out my way and for pray that this pistol play 
 'Cause when I'm heated I'm gunning 'til there's nothing in sight 
 So cancel Christmas muthafucka, fuck you and your life 
 Niggas in my mob is too suave 
 We ride hundred G cars, in it like the world is ours 
 Don't disrespect or get your chest split like cigars 
 In this county of crooks tryin' to avoid jail bars 
 But it's so hard to make cheese especially 
 If you ain't got no Ph.D. or connect on phat keys 
 See mobstability is for niggas with nothing to lose 
 Going psycho from this drama you go through paying dues 
 I get a buck in your side tryin' to hussle for a ride 
 Or hittin' the block to find out one of your guys just died 
 So don't come to the Chi, it's just risky as hell 
 'Cause K-Town niggas'll bomb on that ass like a stealth 
 In the county of crooks, gangbangers, killers and slangers 
 With judges be quick to hang us homies and strangers 
 No bluffin', we bustin' like a kamikaze, watch our bodies come up 
 War [unverified] then it's on, now we gon' strap up, what's up 
 In the county of crooks, gangbangers, killers and slangers 
 With judges be quick to hang us homies and strangers 
 No bluffin', we bustin' like a kamikaze, watch our bodies come up 
 War [unverified] then it's on, now we gon' strap up, what's up 
 Our county's so crooked, Psycho Drama invented the style 
 Then damn near everybody took it and passed it around 
 Now these muthafuckas all look and see 'cause we puttin' it down 
 And ain't no sooner or later, the world gon' realize they fakin' 
 Then snatch they tapes of the shelves 
 And break 'em, eliminate 'em 
 Just as fast as Creator's Way can create shit 
 Now they all on some hation, just like them nigga 
 Like ain't nobody done a thing 
 But we run a reason around these bitches 
 The more tapes we make the more they all go broke, so fuck 'em 
 If it ain't no love then it ain't none 
 If it is, then nigga then say something 
 'Cause more of this beats gon' stomp and keep on stompin' 
 And Drama make that solemn promise 
 That shorty flyin' all on niggas' business 
 Come look around Crook County, look around, you found me 
 I must've been bad to the bone, get the mask and the chrome 
 This Chi gotta die from a blast to the dome 
 Nigga, not muthafuckin' Ouija board 
 I receive my blessings from G's and Lord, nine-millies and source 
 But the art of war nigga, must've found breathin' bored 
 Tellin' me to look into your eyes, all I see is a bitch 
 Tell Krayzie in New Orleans that he bit 
 Talkin' about you was lovin' my shit 
 Hit the bud and got sent on that shit odyssey mumblin' R and B 
 You can keep the apology, you gon' try to dishonor me 
 Kill the Hoes of the Harmony 
 Just when you thought it was safe 
 The Bone niggas 'bout to get slaughtered and raped 
 I can slow down and audit the tape 
 Y'all bent and all y'all who thought it was fake 
 Now watch [unverified] on the stage, beef and the rage 
 Die on the first on the month, 'cause it's than the blunt 
 Why would you compete to be doomed 
 Now you gon' see Eazy-E soon 
 Feel the boom of the reprecussion, 'cause the reefer's still rushin' 
 When I reach and start bustin' 
 I'm a Bone Crusher, crook county or nothin' 
 Ain't no bluffin' 
 In the county of crooks, gangbangers, killers and slangers 
 With judges be quick to hang us homies and strangers 
 No bluffin', we bustin' like a kamikaze, watch our bodies come up 
 War [unverified] then it's on, now we gon' strap up, what's up 
 In the county of crooks, gangbangers, killers and slangers 
 With judges be quick to hang us homies and strangers 
 No bluffin', we bustin' like a kamikaze, watch our bodies come up 
 War [unverified] then it's on, now we gon' strap up, what's up
