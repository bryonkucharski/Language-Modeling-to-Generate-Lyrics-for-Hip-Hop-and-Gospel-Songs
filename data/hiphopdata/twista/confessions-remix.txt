(Intro - J.D.) 
 Uh, listen up listen up listen up world 
 Listen up listen up listen up world, uh, I gotta confess 
 This the hottest remix I ever did in my life so so def 
 [Verse One - Shyne] (J.D.) {*Shyne on the phone*} 
 Sittin' in my cell, had to buck to buck some 
 Would it be allowed if I didn't shoot first 
 Had it made, sorry for the ricochet 
 Would I be here today if I didn't let it spray 
 I never said that I was perfect 
 Nobody walkin' on this earth is 
 At night, I would've gotten murdered 
 If I ain't grab the hatchet and let them cowards have it 
 (Oh, that's the boy Shyne y'all 
 It's ya boy on his way home man, the boy on his way home man) 
 [Chorus - Usher] (Kanye West) These are my confessions 
 Just when I thought I said all I can say 
 My chick on the side, said she got one on the way 
 These are my confessions, man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do 
 I guess I gotta give part 2 of my confessions 
 If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all, (all yeah, yeah) 
 Damn near cried when I got that phone call (call) 
 I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do 
 But to give you part 2 of my confessions 
 (Verse Two - Kanye West) 
 Yeah Kanye To tha College Dropout 
 Man, how does she bring it up how does she break it down 
 Man you at the clinic, dawg slow down that's yo child 
 But if you keep it, then you gotta tell your girl you was cheatin' 
 And you went raw dog when you beat it 
 That's when she gon' tell you to beat it 
 You know it ain't y'all little secret 
 You famous you can't go nowhere 'cause every time you go there 
 There's hoes there so basiclly you and your girl over 
 I know when she broke the news you told her "man don't say that" 
 Matter fact like Pat don't say, that 
 Everytime a nigga sittin' on paychecks 
 Things come up from way way way back I confess 
 [Chorus - Usher] (J.D.) 
 These are my confessions, just when I thought I said all I can say 
 My chick on the side, said she got one on the way (yeah) 
 These are my confessions, man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do 
 I guess I gotta give part 2 of my confessions 
 If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all, (all) 
 Damn near cried when I got that phone call (call) 
 I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do 
 But to give you part 2 of my confession 
 (J.D. - Talking) 
 If you got something to confess to right now step to the mic Twista 
 (Verse Three - Twista) 
 I confess about the incident when I was with a shorty in the Lexus coupe 
 Ya homie said she saw me but she didn't have proof 
 But I knew I really should've just been tellin' you the truth 
 And I confess about the days I was rollin' my Seville with the custom gold grill 
 I was in the field still lookin' for a thrill 
 And I knew it was bogus I should've kept it real 
 And I confess that, just when I thought I could really try to get away 
 While havin' other women on the side 
 But I never knew that it would catch up wit' a nigga one day 
 You gotta hear me girl, I done learned a lesson' 
 If you stay with me then it'll be a blessin', no stressing 
 It'll never be no guessin' 
 'Cause I pulled one out my heart and these are my confessions
