American gangster, US hustler 
 Home of the brave and in God we trust 
 I'm just a American gangster, US hustler 
 Home of the brave and in God we trust 
 I'm just a 
 Chi-Town bred 
 Because I got to rep the city to the death 
 Annihilate them till I don't see nothing left 
 Remember I spit it for the bitches 
 Now I'm spitting for the thugs 
 Hat cocked to the right 
 Hat cocked to the left 
 Brother it's a formal 
 It's a focus on your chest 
 I spit it for the lords 
 And the for the folks 
 And for the Crips and for the Bloods 
 I'm like an American dream 
 I role to the green 
 With the souls and the breeds 
 And the cobras a kings and the 2-16 
 Millimeter bullets for the niggas that 
 Trying to do opposite 
 They don't really want to see how psycho I can get 
 I don't really see a motherfucker stopping this 
 Trying to come at you and the apocalypse 
 .40 cal will have you screaming, "I don't want to die!" 
 I am becoming nauseous with the fake thugs 
 So it's love 
 To the real G's and under bosses 
 To the niggas in the caller case 
 That got into it big 
 To get what nobody gave us 
 We was born into this system 
 So don't be mad at what you made us 
 Pull the pistol and cock it and bust in the sky 
 One time for the US 
 For turning my niggas to gangsters 
 Because getting money is what they do best 
 Hard to fight like I ever did like Al Capone 
 Gangsters is bosses 
 K-Town is the motherfucking hood 
 The Rock is the company, come and step into my office 
 Forever see me in a 'Lac 
 Got work but you never see me in a pack 
 A motherfucker say he never seen me with a strap 
 And I heard a motherfucker say he don't see me in the hood 
 Little nigga I don't see you 
 Because homie my hood is worldwide 
 And getting money is what we do 
 Make your knee joints lock when I freak you 
 Hit the 3 point shot like Hedo 
 Turkoglu up in the game 
 You killing the game like Pac 
 Nigga we point Glocks like he do, see you 
 No one will recognize I'm the maker of the Midwest 
 I'm like for real? 
 Controversy in the middle 
 I guess I'm like Shaquille 
 You can go on feel like you feel 
 Nigga know the hands I like to kill 
 But if you can hit me with the bangs 
 Little cheap for shit, let's strike the deal 
 Got my psychos in the city rolling with me 
 Always ready bust a cap at the king like do 
 I can bury your bodies like an animal 
 Because I'm a cannibal, I eat a nigga like food 
 Ripping through your flesh so I can devour your heart 
 Music is my playground 
 But if the rapping don't get you 
 I hit this head with the back of the pistol until this bitch nigga lay down 
 And no competition I had to be fucking a twig? 
 Whoever coming for me gangster 
 I'ma get it every time I want to get it 
 I'm living proof 
 It's a 'Category F5'
