Man, I know we had a lot of tragedies lately 
 I just wanna say rest in peace to Aaliyah 
 Rest in peace to Left-Eye 
 Rest in peace to Jam Master Jay 
 And everybody lost in the Twin Towers 
 And everybody lost period 
 All we got is hope 
 I wish the way I was living could stop, serving rocks 
 Knowing the cops is hot when I'm on the block, and I 
 Wish my brother woulda made bail 
 So I won't have to travel six hours to see him in jail, and I 
 Wish that my grandmother wasn't sick 
 Or that we would just come up on some stacks and hit a lick, and I (I wish) 
 Wish my homies wouldn't have to suffer 
 When the streets get the upper hand on us and we lose a brother, and I 
 Wish I could go deep in a zone 
 And lift the spirits of the world with the words with in this song, and I (I wish) 
 Wish I could teach a could teach a soul to fly 
 Take away the pain out cha hands and help you hold them hi, and I 
 Wish God never gave the men power 
 To be able to hurt the people inside the Twin Towers, and I (I wish) 
 Wish God woulda turned they hearts righteous 
 When they started to take innocent lives and become snipers, but uh 
 We will never break, though they devastate, we shall motivate 
 And we gotta pray, all we got is faith 
 Instead of thinking about who gonna die to day 
 The Lord is gonna help you feel better, so you ain't gotta cry today 
 Sit at the light so long 
 And then we gotta move straight forward, 'cause we fight so strong 
 So when right go wrong 
 Just say a little prayer, get ya money man, life go on, let's hope 
 'Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today 
 Take this music and use it, let it take you away 
 And be hopeful, hopeful, and he'll make a way 
 I know it ain't easy but, that's okay 
 Let's be hopeful 
 I wish that you could show some love 
 Instead of hatin' so much when you see some other people comin' up (I wish) 
 I wish I could teach the world to sing 
 Watch the music and have 'em trippin of the joy I bring, shit 
 I wish that we could hold hands 
 Listen instead of dissin lessons from a grown man, and I (I wish) 
 Wish the families that lack, but got love, get some stacks 
 Brand new shack and a lack that's on dubs, and I 
 Wish we could keep achieving wonders 
 See the vision of the world through the eyes of Stevie Wonder, you feel me (I wish) 
 And I hope all the kids eat 
 And don't nobody in my family see six feet, ya dig 
 I hope them mothers stain' strong 
 You can make it whether you wit him or your mans gone, and I (I wish) 
 Wish I could give every celly some commissary 
 And the po po bring the heat on them priest like they did R. Kelly, and I 
 Wish that DOC could scream again 
 And bullets could reverse so Pac and Biggie breath again, shit (I wish) 
 Then one day they could speak again 
 I wish that we only saw good news every time we look at CNN 
 I wish that enemies could talk 
 And that super homie Christopher Reeves could still walk (I wish) 
 I wish that we could walk a path, stay doin the right thing 
 Hustle hard so the kids maintain up in the game, let's hope 
 'Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today 
 Take this music and use it, let it take you away 
 And be hopeful, hopeful, and he'll make a way 
 I know it ain't easy but, that's okay 
 Let's be hopeful 
 Wish the earth wasn't so apocalyptic 
 I try to spread my message to the world the best way I can give it 
 We can make it always so optimistic 
 If you don't listen gotta live my life the best way I can live it 
 I pray for justice when we go to court 
 Wish it was all good so the country wouldn't have to go to war 
 Why can't we kick it and just get 'em on 
 And in the famous words of Mr. King "Why can't we all just get along?" 
 Or we can find a better way to shop and please, and I 
 Hope we find a better way to cop a keys, and I 
 Wish everybody would just stop and freeze 
 And ask way are we fulfillin' these downfalls and prophecies 
 You can be wrong if it's you doubting 
 With the faith of a mustard seed you can move mountains 
 And only the heavenly father and ease the hurt 
 Just let it go and keep prayin on your knees in church and let's hope 
 'Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today 
 Take this music and use it, let it take you away 
 And be hopeful, hopeful, and he'll make a way 
 I know it ain't easy but, that's okay 
 'Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today 
 Take this music and use it, let it take you away 
 And be hopeful, hopeful, and he'll make a way 
 I know it ain't easy but, that's okay 
 Let's be hopeful 
 Let's be hopeful 
 Let's be hopeful
