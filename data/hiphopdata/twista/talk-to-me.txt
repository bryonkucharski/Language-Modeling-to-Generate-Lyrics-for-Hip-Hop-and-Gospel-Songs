Talk to me 
 That's the only way I can find out what's going on 
 Now how and the fuck am I supposed to Know what's goin' on 
 You nowin the truth but you steady just be holdin' on 
 You harboring feelings but you don't be tellin' me 
 When you be see'n me would it be better if we was hollin on the phone 
 They tellin' me you got a problem, if it's a cancer 
 Baby the twista got tha cure that can solve it I got the answer 
 Too many guys, too many guns 
 Plenty muscle when I hustle 
 You think a nigga was takin' enhancers 
 We need to holla and get it resolved like gentelmen 
 Because if we don't I got those the turn niggas feminine 
 I'ma pursue when I pop it to'em they're goin' to be choppin and screwin as if I swallowed a bottle of benalyn 
 I'ma just goin' to end up and dumpin if we just don't holla bout somethin' 
 Because you just might makin' a plot to come murder me 
 Oh, your word to be, open heart surgery 
 Yeah you got a white t but I'ma be turnin' motherfucka burgundy 
 I think there's a better way that we can handle this 
 So sit down and talk at the table, we got to be adamant 
 Takin' a ride, and choppin it up in the phantom 
 As two niggas breakin it down like an analyst off the with cannabis 
 He say, she say 
 A nigga was steady be hearin the bogus remarks 
 Thought I was goin' to have to go get it when it get dark 
 We talked about it, shit squashed 
 Now how will I ever be knowin' about when struggles arrive 
 If you don't be open enough to let me see inside 
 Right on the surface of things you thinkin' that he's still alive 
 But since he's been incarcerated his spirit has died 
 He's sittin' off up in the county while he goin' be fightin a case 
 I'm seein the pain 'cause I'm lookin' him right in his face 
 Never got caught off for pushin a bird 
 Now he goin' be lookin' and 30 for murder 
 Even though he ain't on the tape 
 Soon as he got locked up I had to visit him early 
 The truth was the homies and none of those niggas was worthy 
 He gave me my game and told me how bitches'll burn me 
 Damn, I want to kill of the district attorney 
 The loser aka the prosecuter was a steady accuser 
 Of my boy as bein around as the number one shooter 
 They sayin' that the evidence is a rueger, a steady pursuer 
 What it do and make you disappear like the bermuda triangle 
 Why dangle a weapon in front of the court that I know he won't use 
 Now you in deep shit 
 Now I just gotta go pay off my lawyer's retainer 
 Homie gonna have a better defense 
 And I know that you ain't really feel like talkin' about it 
 You want your freedom and just to put it past you 
 This is the only way that we can fight'em, dawg 
 So me and my lawyer goin' sit down and ask you
