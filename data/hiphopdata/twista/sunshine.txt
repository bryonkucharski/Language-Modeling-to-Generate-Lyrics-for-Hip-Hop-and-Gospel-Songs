When I wake up in the mornin' love 
 And the sunlight hurts my eyes 
 Then somethin' without warnin love 
 Bears heavy on my mind 
 Let's get them dollars, Let's get this money 
 I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind 
 I got my finger on tha trigga, stayin' on tha grind 
 And when I wake up in the mornin', I got's to hit a lick 
 Saw the 2000 and 3 Navi, on Sprees wit' a kit 
 Soon as my eyes see tha sunshine 
 My thoughts is jukin' the block, and dodgin' the one time 
 Peep how we movin' the rocks and wit' pounds of dro before I double my shit 
 I can serve sixteen ounces for six and get back ninety-six 
 A killa for tha skrilla, Nigga, Best not be stalkin' 
 I got's to get them bigga, figga's, fuck what you talkin' 
 I represent them nigga's ballin' wit' jewelry full of zickels 
 Down to the nigga's chasin' million, their dreams' servin' nickels 
 And I know, one day, I'm gon' come up 
 And when you see me, don't hate, that I rolled up 
 Get paid whether you legit when you slang, or tippin' off 'cane 
 Until I take a dip in the Range, I'm flippin' them thangs 
 Gotta get that money man 
 It's a lovely day, just got paid 
 Stack it up, be on my way 
 It's Lovely day, lovely day 
 Lovely day, lovely day 
 It's a lovely day, just got paid 
 Stack it up, be on my way 
 Lovely day, lovely day 
 Lovely day 
 A hustler's definition, is a hustler for scratch 
 You serve a motherfucker, you serve him for that 
 I'm makin' money off of verses when I spit 'em on tracks 
 And if I ain't sellin' no records, I'm servin' them packs 
 I got a, clip full of hollows, money makin's my motto 
 Semi-auto and Marlboros in the bottle, 'til I hit the lotto 
 Wit' dreams of ownin' a records label, flippin' words 
 My nigga flippin' buildin's better than he was flippin' birds 
 I got tha, mentality and tha motive I'm on a mission 
 For tha money, you can get it too, it's all about yo ambition 
 Play yo position, provide the plans, and follow procedures 
 In tha six-hundred, blunted, wit' a pocket full of hundred's and Visa's 
 Love, when I get that dust, hit 'em up, re-cock then I get back up 
 Love, when I get that gig, get a crib, get a car when tha grip stack up 
 It's still in the evenin' if I'm sleepin' paper problems 
 Soon as I get up it's just another day, another dollar 
 Gotta get that money man 
 It's a lovely day, just got paid 
 Stack it up, be on my way 
 Lovely day, lovely day 
 Lovely day, lovely day 
 It's a lovely day, just got paid 
 Stack it up, be on my way 
 Lovely day, lovely day 
 Lovely day 
 Got love for the corporate playas that's ballin' rollin' jags 
 Got love for the thug nigga's who get' it on tha ave. 
 Love for those, who can make a mil and sit back and laugh 
 And love for the fine stripper's who get it poppin' ass 
 Love for the single parent's that's workin' through the struggle 
 Love for those who gotta make a livin' movin' muscle 
 Love for those who gotta watch tha hater's rollin' bubbles 
 Causin' trouble every time a young brotha try to hustle 
 And if I can't, legally make or not 
 Then I gotta get, right back on the block 
 And if it no work we do a stick-up and whip-up a concoction 
 Might leave yo face down in the dirt because hurtin's not an option 
 Gotta get that money man 
 It's a lovely day, just got paid 
 Stack it up, be on my way 
 Lovely day, lovely day 
 Lovely day, lovely day 
 It's a lovely day, just got paid 
 Stack it up, be on my way 
 Lovely day, lovely day 
 Lovely day 
 It's a lovely day, just got paid 
 Stack it up, be on my way 
 Lovely day, lovely day 
 Lovely day, lovely day 
 It's a lovely day, just got paid 
 Stack it up, be on my way 
 Lovely day, lovely day 
 Lovely day 
 When I wake up in the mornin' love 
 And the sunlight hurts my eyes 
 Somethin' without warnin' love 
 Bears heavy on my mind
