 Girl I know you want my love (want my love) 
 Girl I know you need my love (need my love)

 Now, everything that I want in a woman 
 When I be lookin' at her body and her mind that's you 
 Me bein' able to give you what you want or what you need 
 When I'm becomin' a love, that's true 
 Please pose because when you do that 
 I know I could never say that the romance is through 
 D. Rose when I be comin', the whistles send you to a victory of an orgasm too 
 Have her with me when I kick back 
 When she roll one, I lit that 
 She a cold one the way she lick that 
 When I hit that she hit back, AOWWW! 
 When I give it to her how she wanna get it'll be the way to make her crazy 
 And every time that she see me on the TV screen she like "There go my baby" 
 'Cause I be fuckin' her, she like the way I'm freakin' her, how I'm freakin' her 
 I'm the one I know she wanna be with 
 Make the call, what time you want me to pick you up? (you up) 
 Tell him you got somethin' to do when I hit you up - because

 Girl I know you want it, girl I know you want it 
 Girl I know you need it, girl I know you need it

 How I'm mackin' you could tell that I want yours 
 I can see that it's obvious that you want mine 
 This could be reality far from folklore 
 When I look at your body and you be so fine 
 Like a coke line, the way she after me gotta be somethin' else I could tell she addicted 
 All on me like an methamphetamine but a better fiend 
 She was thick as hell so we kicked it 
 She became a follower, but she was a swallower 
 Got up with her 'cause I wanna see when she go bottoms up 
 The way she turn her bottle up - oh you a nasty girl 
 And you know that I'm the same way, and you like that shit, so don't give up 
 'Cause we gon' fight, and we gon' fuck 
 You ain't goin' nowhere because
