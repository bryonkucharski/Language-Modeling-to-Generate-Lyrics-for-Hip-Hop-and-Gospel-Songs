 If he broke he ain't no friend of me 
 Wearing fake designer, he ain't no friend of me 
 Money long and still stretching like a centipede 
 Extended clips and prayers for all my enemies 
 (Chief Keef) 
 He ain't no friend of me kill that fucking nigga like my enemy 
 I'm tired of this nigga being in front of me 
 All these dinners killing me, my energy (Gang) 
 Catch a fuck nigga show him what he meant to me (Bang Bang) 
 And I cop this MAC, it go right back 
 You told those dudes dude sound like a high hat 
 I'm towing on this chopper, it go great great 
 Same puss I beg for then I pay for my head 
 Send me up, baby girl, don't try that 
 I got my fellow me and every mob gat 
 Too much tooka pack where my life at 
 Roll this calm out this chopper, where the knife at? 
 They say when you're rich, you can't have broke friends 
 I guess I just noticed that 
 They with you when you're rich but when it all ends 
 Bet that shit be all over with

 (Twista) 
 I still want none, get on a track and I go dumb 
 Keep talking shit, you see them BDs come 
 And the Lords come and them folks come 
 And they be coming with some shit, better click at it, clack 
 Clip after clip after Mac and some shit that'll rip out your back 
 Hollow heavy hitter, bullets'll slip out the crack 
 My haters get ghost, what, chewing all that money 
 You were saying to me you ain't got a prop or job 
 You're a shame to me, half nigga always in the club 
 You were thot to me, can't pay for VIP, parking, you broke to me 
 Used to got no money, you mistaking me 
 For that other nigga that you seen, he ain't none of me 
 Pull up in that Benz with no key, sit on 4 G's 
 Killers all behind me, send this bitch up, G
