 My car burnin', my weed burnin' 
 My bitch so bad, you touch her once 
 She burn you 
 So much money I burn it 
 So much money I burn it 
 So much money I burn it 
 So much money I burn it 
 My car burnin', my weed burnin' 
 My bitch so bad, you touch her once 
 She burn you

 My crews are sittin' on ostrich 
 Smoking the blunt that's preposterous 
 Shoe box, a hundred in my closet 
 On the way to the bank to make a deposit 
 I get dollars and money 'cause I deserve it 
 Do what the fuck I want with it 'cause I earned it 
 Roll up one hundred dollar bill, then I burn it 
 Put some bud up in the bag then I serve it 
 Words is, comin' down up out the way that I be such a professional when I purr 
 What I heard about rookies 
 They don't know what they be doing when they fuckin' with the huffers that are fuckin' with the girl scout cookies 
 Get the hash, light it up 
 If you got some bad bitches, then invite them up 
 I burn a blunt and if it's tires on a car we burn a rubber, give a motherfucker [?] 
 I know that weed gon' linger 
 Cause ain't no telling what we gon' bring you 
 You wanna feel it, cover the hole, and hit it in the bone 
 Now release your finger 
 Get the full effect up out the mechanism 
 When I hit the ism as if I was looking through a prism 
 Rollin' with Berner and Wiz and we get high as 
 I wanna get for my niggas that be looking through a prison 
 I don't take it for granted, so I blow 
 I'mma keep it with me wherever that I go 
 You ain't gonna tell me, I know that my eyes low 
 I don't give a fuck, I light up and ride slow 
 Everything I know burn, and my flows burn and my rings burn 
 And my watch burn and my truck burn 
 And my eyes burn and my green burn 
 (Wiz Khalifa) 
 My car burnin', my weed burnin' 
 My bitch so bad, you touch her once 
 She burn you 
 So much money I burn it 
 So much money I burn it 
 So much money I burn it 
 So much money I burn it 
 My car burnin', my weed burnin' 
 My bitch so bad, you touch her once 
 She burn you 
 So much money I burn it 
 So much money I burn it 
 So much money I burn it 
 So much money I burn it

 Climb ... get the beer right 
 Last time I should is air tight 
 Big Bern play around 
 Baby girl, keep a big gun on me, is a crazy world 
 Can I just get money on my whole team? 
 Break it down, I'm [clean] the whole day 
 Take break money blow it on a gold chain 
 Do a hundred, roll up 
 Please don't stop, and see the gun smoke 
 When I unload, better duck low 
 Only run from the undos like 
 It was fun though, in a black track with a [clean] 
 Stay on top, then you slapped up 
 PJ about to get wrapped up 
 Good pack, but the money gonna get stacked up 
 Took too many might OD 
 I'm low key, I'm OG xanax and codine 
 Girl, I'm in that OC 
 Done a lot of crap, she says is a plus 
 She work late nights, now shake a [club] 
 She played a dwag, that's made you look 
 Count so much, you got paper cuts 
 Take 200 and burn it 
 So much weed that I'm burning 
 Hit the gas, my car burning 
 I'm popping tags, and that [hard cooking] 
 You got twelve girls and they're all [looking] 
 Pull up in that and they all looking 
 She's star struck, get your broad [?] 
 When she mad at you she car burning
