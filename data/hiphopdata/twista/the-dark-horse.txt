 Did you forget about me? 
 How you gon' forget about me? 
 Should've bet it all on me 
 Now you wanna fuck with me 
 They wanna put a chink into Twista's armor 
 But I didn't even blink in that fiscal karma 
 I just be stuntin' on these niggas and ballin' on 'em 
 Tellin' 'em I'mma be forever young 
 Cause ain't no motherfuckin' artist alive fuckin' with me 
 You know it, they compare to none 
 I am a Dark Horse 
 Creatively comin' from a dark force 
 Closin' the unexpected turn of events as I commence to 
 Givin' you another definition of hardcore 
 Lord have mercy on the souls that competed with me 
 And didn't know what I was capable of 
 Let a nigga on the track and I attack and snatch a beat 
 And murder it, especially off of an eigth of the bud 
 Now recognizing me is an abomination 
 Speaking on the coldest and I'm not in the conversation 
 Overachiever, forever the underdog 
 I spit it but still omitted from every writer's congregation 
 When I ain't on the list with the mic splitters 
 Every once in a while I do be quite bitter 
 The big 3D style about who quite iller 
 Dark Horse, Ray Allen, Mike Miller

 Did you forget about me? 
 How you gon' forget about me? 
 Should've bet it all on me 
 Now you wanna fuck with me 
 I did it myself, my nigga 
 Didn't need your help, my nigga 
 Played the the cards I was dealt, my nigga 
 Now I got the belt, my nigga 
 And they screamin' out "that's my nigga" 
 Did you forget about me? 
 Now you wanna fuck with me 
 Can't forget about him, 'cause he stuntin' 
 OG is how I'm now forever runnin' with a pocket full of hundreds 
 Spit it how I get it and they want it 'cause I flaunt it 
 Because I get to the money 
 If I get to that honey, I'mma have 'em all hatin' on me 
 Screamin' out "that nigga just don't stop" 
 Intricate part of my style is the way I swag on 'em 
 When I'm goin' so fast and still it be so hard 
 And when I do I know these niggas can't fuck with me 
 Style, it be ugly, they don't want none of me 
 And if we do get into it, it's gonna be 
 Just some shit that's in front of me 
 I'mma come gunnin', we conquer all obstacles 
 And if it's possible, I'mma get money, we 
 Welcome haters and challengers, fakers not down with us 
 Takin' our sound from us, we can get it on 
 If they want a rhyme from us and I... 
 Be takin' 'em out of the faith of a doubter 
 The face of a coward, who's bravery's forsaken for power and then I... 
 See if he learned his lesson, not to bully the lil' one 
 'Cause he don't want it 
 Probably get the pistol off a molly that'll hit you 
 A one that'll come with a style of another phenomenal that'll be turnin' up the 
 Party when he diss you, it'll probably be an issue 
 If you think I'mma let you forget about the way 
 I can throw flames on 'em 
 Trinidad, All Gold Everything on 'em 
 Pull a Juelz and go all cocaine on 'em
