(Intro: Twista) 
 Yeah, y'all ready to ball, are y'all really ready to ball? 
 It's the Twista, EA Sports 2004, NBA Live 
 And you know how it go down, check it 
 (Chorus: Twista) 
 You think you're too cold but I 
 Think you need to go and grab 
 Your favorite squad 
 Put your warm up suit on 
 'Cause we about to get our hoop on 
 (Verse 1: Twista) 
 In this game ain't nobody colder 
 When I post to Pippen and I be wicked with the cross over, two times over 
 When I'm floating over your shoulder 
 I look amazing why you standing like a lost soldier 
 But I'm all right 
 Representing, I'll be hooping with the Knicks all night 
 Rather be producing with Houston 
 And running with Spree 
 And plus, thinking that Antonio McDyess 
 He's so nice with the peel 
 I'm a stay fly when I kick it and switch it to A.I. in Phillyville 
 Look at the reply if you will 
 And he got no skills and it be a guarantee that he go grill 
 And win every time 
 Brother got to get with Kobe 
 Especially if the game is on my mind 
 Shaq up in the paint 
 With Fisher and Horry dropping treys 
 And Devean George hurting of the pine 
 Got them crying like a baby 
 Minnesota got them fast Mercedes, I put them asleep with big K.G 
 If I got the Sacramento Kings, or Mike Bibby 
 It will be impossible for you to fade me 
 I play the game, fully in control 
 Hit me with some three's and I'm a take it to the hole 
 EA Sports 2004, NBA Live, if you didn't, now you know 
 But I know 
 (Chorus: Twista) - (2X)
