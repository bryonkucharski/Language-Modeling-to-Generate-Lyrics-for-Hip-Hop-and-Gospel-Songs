(Feat. Turtle Banxx) 
 You know man Turtle Banxx 
 I want you to go in there and get them niggas man 
 Let 'em know the drought is over man 
 Game recognize game cock your pistols and aim (wee straight) 
 All about hustlin and bustin' for change (wee straight) 
 To go there we can get in this bitch (wee straight) 
 Ballin for scratch ready to die for this shit 
 (Turtle Banxx) 
 Don't you know that talking shit ain't wise 
 Nigga I'll advise you and your guys to get the fuck outta my presence 
 I got trigger eyes 
 Venom plower situations reaping bloody demonstrations when the heat dies 
 You won't see guys conversating 
 Only homicides and yellow tapings 
 No suspect no motives mad villains living bogus 
 If we don't catch you you best believe we tag whoever closest 
 And make you feel the motions 
 Turtle Banxx got kill notions that's real potent 
 Have you ever see I still smoking 
 Senile emotions you'll soul cokeland 
 Not a body open fuck ABC's 
 Best to be on P's and Q's I'ma get diseases if you snoozes 
 You ready yet? 
 You better study your tech and be a threat fucking coward 
 Or face trigger vests with celeb ways to wreck 
 Off with all heads and all bets 
 I'm on your neck sending straight .57 threats at your neck nigga 
 Straight .57 till your face don't blink 
 Nowhere to run no time to think 
 So what you wanna do when it's on like that 
 In a chill when we steal and your soul get snatched out ya body 
 Shotties to your face don't blink 
 Nowhere to run no time think 
 So what you wanna do when it's on like that 
 In a chill when we steal and your soul get snatched out ya body 
 Catch me with a semi on cop 
 Been in your block dumping 17 shots in your spot 
 Putting niggas in shops ready for a box 
 Made my getaway slick as a fox 
 Taking the ditches the cops 
 Escaping visions of prisons and locks 
 My mission don't stop no pot to piss in so the plot thickens 
 I keep hearing gats clicking 
 See I'm into strange places 
 Wear a mask to cover up they faces if they want me why they procrastinate 
 Is it just in oasis? 
 Perpetrated by my imagination 
 Apple Texas trojan am I tasting 
 My own death gun fire got me toned deaf 
 So I say a silent but I save my ownself 
 Can you clone death? 
 Like they do life I see the blue light hearing the sirens 
 Amongst the madness and the violence gun firing 
 Tragedies of lying in to I want a murderous round boy 
 That let niggas don't talk infa-red triggers caulk 
 A nigga trying to cheat life 
 Now death says name affiliation in the street life 
 I see nights away from the mics 
 Far from the henny and ice where many ya like for the riches and life 
 While shaking the device with a camera device like dice 
 From pistol fights nickel hypes murder and mics is life 
 In the Chi and Suge Knight 
 So think twice or faces vicious types in pit fights 
 The blocks hotted the cops watching for anything unusual happen 
 They been stoping profits three days in tracking 
 Drug traffic distracting clientele with drug habits 
 Load them thangs and make them slugs happen 
 Enemies of surprise got 'em frantic 
 Scattered and panicked damaged by any 11 
 Ducked behind a treasure box let 'em have it 
 Managed to get away hide away your weapons 
 Probably still there but they ain't telling 
 Belling to the bank for my safe deposit 
 Gotta take my grub on these narcotics properly watching 
 With a copy of my face composite 
 Description all the way down to the J's I'm rocking 
 Laser dots and the ducking police dogs hunting 
 Resistin everything I'm touching 
 Blood running down from the barbwire bloodening 
 Choppers hovering sirens coming closer 
 Grab our toaster, I'm supposed to surrender 
 But I done heard the shots from the trigger of a 
 Yeah yeah 
 You see man 
 I told you man 
 Get them niggas man 
 They know not to 
 The drought is over 
 The drought is over man 
 Turtle Banxx 
 Yeah
