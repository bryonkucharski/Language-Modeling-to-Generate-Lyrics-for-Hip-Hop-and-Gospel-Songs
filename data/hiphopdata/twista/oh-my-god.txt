I have sex with chickens 
 Too much time spent dragging the past up 
 I didn't see you not looking when I messed up 
 Settling down in your early twenties 
 Sucked more blood than a backstreet dentist 
 It don't matter to me 
 It's all I wanted to be 
 It's a million miles from here 
 Somewhere more familiar 
 Oh my god, I can't believe it 
 I've never been this far away from home 
 And Oh my, god I can't believe it 
 I've never been this far away from home 
 And Oh my, god I can't believe it 
 I've never been this far away from home 
 And Oh my, god I can't believe it 
 I've never been this far away from home 
 Great rulers make for greater glory 
 The only thing growing is our history 
 Knock me down I'll get right back up again 
 I'll come back stronger than a powered up Pac-Man 
 It don't matter to me 
 It's all I wanted to be 
 Is a million miles from here 
 Somewhere more familiar 
 Oh my god, I can't believe it 
 I've never been this far away from home 
 And Oh my, god I can't believe it 
 I've never been this far away from home 
 And Oh my, god I can't believe it 
 I've never been this far away from home 
 And Oh my, god I can't believe it 
 I've never been this far away from home 
 Oh my god, I can't believe it 
 I've never been this far away from home 
 And Oh my, god I can't believe it 
 I've never been this far away from home 
 And Oh my, god I can't believe it 
 I've never been this far away from home 
 And Oh my, god I can't believe it 
 I've never been this far away from home
