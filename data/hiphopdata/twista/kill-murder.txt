 Most of you motherfuckers is comical 
 The rule like me is impossible 
 Verbally illogical I took the heat and then followed you to your residence 
 And spread your molecules blood floods your follicles 
 Damn right we don't acknowledge you 
 The streets got eyes of leopard for telling niggas to up weaponry 
 When they see your ass blast and feed your ass to the fish 
 Life's a bitch that'll suck ya dick 
 And tell them guys we hit that cash 
 Kick ass nigga they coming for the whole pie 
 Old time guys that wont be satisfied till you lay in a grave 
 Wont be satisfied till the location of the safe cave 
 Some were shining too much so I hide in the shade 
 The minute you made this move gave him one to his brain 
 Kill kill kill murder murder murder 
 Kill kill kill murder murder murder 
 In every video its 
 Kill kill kill murder murder murder 
 In every studio its 
 Kill kill kill murder murder murder 
 And tell me who ya know that 
 Kill kill kill murder murder murder 
 In every video its 
 Kill kill kill murder murder murder 
 In every studio its 
 Kill kill kill murder murder murder 
 And tell me who ya know that 
 Kill kill kill murder murder murder

 Now I roll like minutes and foes with killers that fold 
 Idiotic motherfuckers smokin' 'dro by the O's 
 More by the box so what's this is how we rock it 
 Beats by Cayex and Toxic 
 China White find a mic 
 Imagine you can't stop it 
 Enough of profit haters make me sick stay on the dick 
 Talking like they made me rich bitch please face it 
 Legit ballin gave me this and you can't take me 
 Cause you can't make it in this game you gotta hate it 
 Niggas kill me with that weak shit come around on street shit 
 Guns that don't reach shit in a talk of insanity 
 Deaths wanted at your ass blast your identity 
 Ain't no hoes over you ain't know 
 We don't fold we monopolize and ostracize hoes 
 Bitch ass niggas that try to rise 
 I'm sick of the die sick of the knives sick of the guy that say 
 (Twista) 
 I had smoked three fillos falling on these spindles 
 Its Twist and T Bizzle 
 When I blast heat metal he like like beat bittles we little 
 Niggas act like the heart and the heartless 
 That still bust contrages that rip through cartilage 
 Turn these mortals into gods and goddesses 
 I bury ya slug in them haters claiming they veins pump up 
 Burying blood turns out y'all the scariest thug 
 On my nutsac that's how I get into sack 
 Sorrow hollows I spit at ya jag if he don't die he gonna shit in a bag 
 From K Town to V.I.P. ain't no V.I.P. 
 Ain't no three I.D.'s 
 That'll get you to a place where we got keys and peas off our trees 
 Controversy wild niggas that's thirsty and bodily fluids 
 Smoking terror that'll smell bloody hands on your soul like mascara 
 Disciples of death 
 You wont even hear fears in they cry 
 Don't you hear that cold in they throat and see they tears in they eyes 
 My niggas rhyme that's all I love 
 Put a bullet to the sky but a nigga gotta die if he call my blood 
 So watch it when you say 
 Kill kill kill murder murder murder 
 Kill kill kill murder murder murder 
 Kill kill kill murder murder murder 
 Kill kill kill
