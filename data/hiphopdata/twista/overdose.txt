Shit, niggas got me higher than a motherfucker off up in here, man. 
 Damn, the fuck y'all get this weed from? 
 Motherfucker overdose or some shit off this shit, god damn 
 Check this shit out though... 
 (Twista) 
 Now pussy player haters say that I'm too raw with it 
 But y'all thinkin' 'cause I be talkin' shit 
 Them hoes say that nigga cold as hell 
 Fuck what the punks are talkin' bout 
 I wanna get up with that big ballin bitch 
 Plus niggas feelin' what I'm on as well 
 Plus got my mind in the zone 
 The one that's rocking fresh Pelle Pel's 
 Sweet tooth'll shine on his bone 
 Somebody beatin' up the block on fresh rider rims 
 If it's me hell, you can tell by the design on the chrome 
 Crying on the phone 
 Hoe thinkin' I'm in love with her 
 'Cause she took me shoppin' and had me tryin' on cologne 
 So I left her on the line with the tone 
 Got up with this other bitch 
 Brought no weed 'cause she fire'n up her own 
 So hurry with the Phillie bitch, I'm really sick 
 Off of some illa shit 
 Here go a rusty razor blade, but still it split 
 And fill it with the killer shit so I can really trip 
 It's like the bud was tailor made for milli-clips 
 And mac-10's, I lit the b from the back end 
 Straight to the chest and it got me sprung 
 My lungs started collapsing - shit nigga what's happenin'? 
 The sess got me trippin' off the drums and guns, ready for action 
 Duck a swang or either other thang 
 Try to be tough and bang and scuff and hang 
 Suffer pain left deranged then youse a bogus m'uhfucker mayn 
 Since the beat struck a vein, I'm too strange 
 For m'uhfuckers to compete with 
 I'm on some infrared heat shit 
 With a deep clique, what I eat sleep shit 
 Well if it's a freak bitch, she can suck a sweet dick 
 Till she's seasick; blockin niggas out like an eclipse 
 When smokin' them devils put your hands together 
 Like you know the host 
 Cause ain't no nigga that can resist the words from the Twist' 
 Leavin' niggas comatose from my overdose 
 Chorus: Twista 
 I done put the fuel on it, take a pull on it 
 We overdosin on weed and sendin all y'all off into a thang 
 Kill off all enemies while makin' G's, catch you off on your knees 
 And snatchin fees now that I'm up in this game 
 I done put the fuel on it, take a pull on it 
 We overdosin on weed and sendin all y'all off into a thang 
 Kill off all enemies while makin' G's, catch you off on your knees 
 Niggas rollin' me b's just so they can hang 
 (Twista) 
 Can you figure out the cause and effect? 
 Niggas comin' on your set 
 Thugs comin' out they drawers with a tec 
 Victim bleedin from the neck 
 Shirts is getting wet, shorties yellin' threats 
 Lookin' for the one who called for the deck 
 Now they airin out the hall in the spot 
 Hitting stomachs leavin' niggas pinched up 
 Bodies balled in a knot 
 Bullet holes in the wall from a glock 
 Searchin for the one who called in the shots 
 Hypes crawlin for rocks 
 Goin' all in the socks of the recently deceased 
 From what was released 
 From the chrome beast to the dome piece 
 Visions in my mind bein increased by inner beef 
 And some grief, but when I chief on some strong leaf 
 I'm snappin hard enough to make a nigga try to check his own chief 
 Violate him but can't annihilate him 
 Pickin' up his own teeth and it's on with the microphone deep 
 Stimulate him with pistols penetrate him 
 Nerves still droppin' cause adrenaline pumpin is a m'uhfucker 
 Hit him with the steel bloodsuckers 
 Murdered the bud, and I was makin' sure 
 Every one of you hoe studs suck us 
 And I bullshit you not if it was full clips, two glocks 
 You would still die or you'll get too hot 
 'Cause when my fuel kick you'll drop 
 Hypes is trickin on you 
 Tell me where he at bitch and you'll get two rocks 
 (Okay!) 'Cause when my tool click you'll pop 
 Can't have this hype nigga stop shit, I'm hazardous 
 Makin' musical miracles like I'm Jesus of Nazerath 
 Yet disastrous, smokin' on half and hash, fuck if it's cancerous 
 Bust ass (??) 'cause I mastered this 
 It's hard to breathe, I'm bustin' like an A-bomb 
 'Cause I'm in the zone, twenty-two a cold shit up my sleeve 
 It's hard to stay calm 
 Thinkin' about the bitches that I've been up on 
 Hittin my enemies and competition up with lethal rolls 
 That's damagin, flows that's callous and we're leavin' 
 Thick ladies frantic and people in the industry panickin 
 I thought we got in this to get out of pistol handlin 
 Now it's possible m'uhfuckers could start vanishin 
 Fuck the Anacin I be toking plenty of stanky for stress 
 And flowin over notes; them studs thinkin' they can get close 
 I know I got you trippin' off the shit 
 A nigga said off a overdose 
 (Twista) 
 C'mon and toke on a dub with me; I love cities with parties 
 That's full of bitches where they let me rub titties 
 Be able to pack a snub with me; in case we get in some static 
 And gotta start leakin blood from stud skinnies 
 So don't ask if it's the bud in me; because for some reason 
 I smoke on some weed and get too wicked and raw 
 It can't be nickel or somethin', way it's chokin me 
 Potency'll have me rockin' mics 
 And givin' your bitch dick in the jaw, I'm hookin the law 
 You're lookin' in awe, took what you saw 
 Got the B's pen and pad out the bottom drawer 
 Then got to bitin and formulatin some shit you called your own 
 But take it to the rehab cause you got a flaw 
 To put it simple you ain't cold enough 
 Trippin' out like you can't control the stuff 
 Lackin rhythm like you known to bust 
 In a different zone from us 
 You niggas need to sit the fuck down 
 Get a swisher and roll this up 
 If you think I'm speakin' too bold, whassup? 
 I ain't even on no hoe shit; plus the mob is so thick 
 I'm the type of nigga you should wanna get up close to 
 And take a smoke with 
 If there's static then check yo' clique; my mind is so sick 
 I be tweakin with speakin' releasin energy to show I know the ropes 
 'Cause when it comes to this rap shit 
 Niggas will choke till I'm ghost 
 While I breath reefer smoke from my overdose 
 Try to put me to the test, gimme some budda bless 
 I'll show you who the best 
 Release the vocal trilogy... 
 Traxter Aight T god damn slow it up mayn! M'uhfuckers done felt you mayn! 
 We can go on to some next shit 
 Twista God damn man you stoppin' motherfuckers and shit 
 Man I'm tryin' to get my zone on 
 Let niggas hear what the fuck I'm doin' man 
 Traxter I mean you done zoned man 
 Let's go to the next cut baby 
 Twista Man, fuck that shit
