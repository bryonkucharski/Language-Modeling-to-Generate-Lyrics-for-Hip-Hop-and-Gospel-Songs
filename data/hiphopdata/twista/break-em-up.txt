 Put ya guns down

 But back in 88 bust I heard ya plugged out

 Mo money mo cash mo hoes now ya sitting on 20 
 If it came down to it nigga fuck your mob 
 And if ya wanna get 'em all we can squad and squad

 Who wanna get touched with plastic plastic 
 I see ya standing in the path trick path trick 
 Now do ya wanna be around bitch around bitch 
 'Cause I don't give a fuck if the club on ya block or not 
 'Cause if ya step on our toes then its bound to get hot 
 Its bound to get heated all of us we got a SK and a chopper 
 Better utensils bound to break me off proper 
 From the 51st ward nigga 
 We all ghetto so while ya practice looking hard nigga 
 You need to let go and umm remove ya bodyguard nigga

 Tear the club up like the mafia till I make a mil nigga 
 Shorty shake something

 Standing on the side of me

 And if somebody ask how much my bitch cost 
 With an ignorant ass I burst like that and bound to get tossed 
 Reload this disrespect for that nigga 
 That'll be your arm and your leg

 And in our head shot rearranging ya frame

 When we fall up in the party watch the deck go up
