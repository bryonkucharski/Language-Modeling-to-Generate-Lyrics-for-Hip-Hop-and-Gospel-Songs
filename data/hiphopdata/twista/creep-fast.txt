--Intro (Twista) 
 C'mon, c'mon, ay T-Pain, T-Pain, it's Twista, comin' this way, c'mon 
 We gotta creep fast, c'mon 
 --Verse 1 (Twista) 
 Watch as I hit it through the middle of the city in the Chevy, and I'm ready with the woofers that'll beat up your block 
 And I got them takin' the machete for them niggas I could pay to get then get to talkin' I'ma heat up your block 
 If you wanna bring your boys, better bring the toys, better bring the noise, I'm bout to pop off (?) ammunition 
 Bodies I be hittin' when I get to spittin', everybody should have broken in, nobody listened, so now I 
 Roll on 24's when I'm on your tip, they all know who I am, ain't nobody talkin' shit, tell me when did they ever think that I was a hoe 
 'Cause I got killers with me, crips, bloods, g's and fours 
 And we be focused on the paper when we be up in the kitchen, we be thinking 'bout the money on a steady come up 
 And I got the niggas that be ready for whatever with a whole war chest if a nigga run up 
 AK 47, Desert Eagle, SK, Mac 11, for them niggas that'll try to run up 
 Nigga what you want, I'm a bone thug, get you while you sleepin' 'cause you know I'm creepin' on the come up 
 --Chorus (T-Pain) 
 Mother fuckers actin' like they don't know me, but they know just who I am, 
 I'm a mother fucking killer gorilla nigga you better act like you understand 
 'Cause I'm a killer, a mass murder, the realest nigga, that you ever heard of 
 Mother fuckers actin' like they don't know the deal but they know just what to do 
 Everybody talkin' in the streets so you know that I'm comin' straight for you 
 'Cause I'm a killer, a mass murder, the realest nigga, that you ever heard of 
 --Verse 2 (Twista) 
 Try to play a nigga and get over onto Twista I'ma see you when I see you and I wouldn't wanna be you 
 Drop that Desert Eagle when I'm rollin' in a Regal when I'm lookin' at you evil through the eye of a needle 
 It's not a misdemeanor but a murder with a millimeter feel the heat of Twista when I'm bustin' at your wheel 
 I kill a burglar when I be comin' for your shit I'ma get you for your goods when I run up in your crib 
 Tell me where your jewelry at, where your safe, don't make me have to smack this ugly bitch in her face 
 Is it behind that portrait or is it in your floor 
 Just let me know so that I can hit it up 'cause I got to go 
 'Cause I gotta throw it so I hit a lick on them niggas 'cause it used to be that or I had to get 'em I'ma get 'em 
 Now I ride a burgundy Lamborghini Murcielago through the city because I know that'll kill 'em 
 Averaging a hundred yards per game, my competition better back up I'm the key running back 
 Niggas that ain't ready get the machete for the lyrical Jason of rap, I'ma keep coming back 
 --Chorus (T-Pain) 
 Mother fuckers actin' like they don't know me, but they know just who I am, 
 I'm a mother fucking killer gorilla nigga you better act like you understand 
 'Cause I'm a killer, a mass murder, the realest nigga, that you ever heard of 
 Mother fuckers actin' like they don't know the deal but they know just what to do 
 Everybody talkin' in the streets so you know that I'm comin' straight for you 
 'Cause I'm a killer, a mass murder, the realest nigga, that you ever heard of 
 --Verse 3 (Twista) 
 The lyrical assassin and I'm packin' a gat and I'll be attackin' the track up and I gotta package of the good 
 See a legendary representing for the city 'cause I put it down ever since I been rappin' in the hood 
 Seventeen years ago on the flow and the show and these niggas when it come to beatin' me, nobody could 
 I was spittin' venom ever since them days UGK be rappin' and talkin' bout puttin' diamonds on the wood 
 Rollin' in an old Cadillac before I got some fame 
 I done got that gwap and that number one spot, now I ride a range 
 And because I spit that crack is the reason we got some change 
 And if we ain't makin' money off rap then we got them things 
 Got the eight dollar hollers two for fifteens and four on the split and nine piece so you can hit the whole brick 
 How about makin' a hundred every summer, pullin' up in a Hummer can make a nigga so sick 
 How bout canceling come up with hits and steady be getting' fans only because a nigga flow sick 
 So with no debate, everybody know I'm great, any mother fucker that hate can suck my dick 
 --Chorus (T-Pain) 
 Mother fuckers actin' like they don't know me, but they know just who I am, 
 I'm a mother fucking killer gorilla nigga you better act like you understand 
 'Cause I'm a killer, a mass murder, the realest nigga, that you ever heard of 
 Mother fuckers actin' like they don't know the deal but they know just what to do 
 Everybody talkin' in the streets so you know that I'm comin' straight for you 
 'Cause I'm a killer, a mass murder, the realest nigga, that you ever heard of
