(INTRO) This goes out to all riders worldwide 
 Let that playa ass nigga Twista be your guide as we go on a ride 
 Where playa hatin' killers and the hood niggaz thrive 
 And lame motherfuckers can barely survive 
 One morning I woke up next to a thick bitch 
 Took a shower dried off brushed the gold teeth like Slick Rick 
 Tapped on Obsession colonge like Doug E. Fresh in the flesh 
 Think I'm blessed with the zest after slippin on my slick fit 
 The high discover me, hit the front porch 
 Two women butterly lovely in front of me got my head gone 
 I sent the bitch in the bed home 'cause one of them 
 Got chocolate big thighs and the other one was a redbone 
 Where y'all goin' y'all thick as hell 
 What's your name I wanna get up with y'all tonight shit 
 I got some homies that lonely never phony we on some hype shit 
 Call up the buddies you be tight with 
 We ain't really gon be doin' too much though 
 We just ridin' around bumpin sounds trippin' out while we flame janes 
 Tappin the horn at the homies that gangbang 
 And slang 'caine to maintain to mob's the same thing 
 Or we can chill at the crib and play spades or kick some ass a bit 
 Speedpass the clit and get passionate 
 Grab the buckle and unfasten it 
 And we can get into some ol' nasty shit 
 Live if I could decide to try, don't play me bogus 
 This ain't no spin move and I ain't got no time to lie 
 Tell your girls we gonna be sliding by 
 But hit the weed tip first cause my clique got to be riding high 
 Cause it feels so good 
 It feels so good how we kick it in the hood like so good 
 (When we ridin' high) 
 Rollin' through the hood with Phillies and hoes 
 Straight pimpin' with nowhere to go 
 And it feels so good the way we kick it in the hood like so good 
 (When we ridin' high) 
 Rollin' through the hood with Phillies and hoes 
 Straight pimpin' with nowhere to go 
 Me and my homies hooked up some cowards took up 
 When niggas we lust smokin' some but the flame tight 
 Trippin' off how we survivin the rugged terrain 
 And try to hang tight getting fucked up on gang night 
 Used to be gang fights now we gotta try to relax with the scrap 
 Even we sent Deebo back to back to back 
 We still be holdin' stacks of packs 
 Rollin' through wit black blacks, blunt reds, ash trays, and crack sacks 
 Hustlin and chillin's what I'm focusin on 
 Fiendin through bitch's cribs hopin it's on 
 If ain't no strokin we strollin along 
 Rollin' the chrome out really trippin' 
 Because we take the smoke to the dome 
 Bumpin the tunes while bigger roles and herringbones 
 Glisten from all the sunlight 
 Peepin the fe's with their hair done tight 
 Booty hung right and every night we see at least one fight 
 Hookin up with my fellow Westside cliques 
 Now together we mush 
 But when are we strapped through and rug cutters 
 Just like the envy and jealousy throughout the other is love brothers 
 Ridin' every one of y'all my muhfuckers 
 So put the Black Magic on the tires and get the wax off the chrome 
 We gon' to blaze on till my brain's blown 
 Hopin to get my thang on 
 Not matter what block you stay on kick it 
 Round the world it's the same song 
 (So the Mobsters just flame on) 
 For scratch we was willin' to squirt some blood 
 Now we got up on hittin the 'cause 
 From stealin' tips where they're swum the doves 
 Mo' we got up on some bud 
 Straight hittin' up the block searching for love 
 Reach up and hit the deep lung then we gone 
 Smokin' delight the body right what the party like 
 Are you as live as I come roll with meso we can ride the sky 
 But only if you let me play with you while we ridin' high 
 Cause it feels so good 
 Sittin' back cruising through the slow breeze 
 Thinkin' how can I get mo' cheese 
 Bumpin a system costin 4 G's 
 I stay on my P's for the po-P's 
 Split the Phillie with my door keys 
 Scoop a female to the crib good get my boy to bring a blessin through 
 Sit on the floor playin' Tekken 2 
 Lesson two I'm adressin you 
 Turn out the lights like the World Class Wreckin' Crew 
 Bring out the best in you 
 Confessin true lies about your inner thighs 
 And where they been hopin maybe you be my lady 
 What's the potatoes without the gravy 
 What you feelin' on maybe soft with the silicone baby 
 But can you pay me? 
 Cause daily we be riding in the dope stroll 
 While rockin' dope flows I'll lose the spot if I choose to stop 
 We can cruise some blocks and talkin' about 
 How later on you comin' out your clothes, shoes and socks 
 Now is that news or not? 
 Come I step on the gas slow and smoke on this last "O" 
 Get a "B" and split it now watch me kill it 
 Tinted windows took a sealin' off in the Astro 
 On billets take a choke on so I can really feel it 
 Thinkin' about not having the rich life 
 But the hood life was still a good life 
 And that we know always and forever though 
 For ever more rollin' in the ghetto with nowhere to go 
 And it feels so good
