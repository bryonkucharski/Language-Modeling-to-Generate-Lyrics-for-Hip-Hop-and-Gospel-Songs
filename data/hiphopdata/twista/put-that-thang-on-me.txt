(Feat. Oobie) 
 Man 
 I got to figure out something to do 
 To get this nigga back in my life for real 
 Put something on 
 You put that thang on me man shorty 
 Then you put it down on me 
 You ain't even have to do me like that 
 The you stop calling me 
 He believes power me or something dam 
 Everday and everynight all I wanna do is see you 
 Figure out how to be near you 
 Doing the things you do 
 You stay all day is to me 
 All night is to me and you really made me feel good 
 You put that thang down on me thang down on me and I really knew you could 
 I took the baretta that you knew that what to do with a girl like me 
 You worked my body and turned it inside out fulfilled all my fantasy's 
 You worked that hump on ya back 
 Lay me on my back broke down and did the ooh 
 Then you stopped calling me and I don't know what to do 'cause baby you 
 You put that thang on me 
 The one that makes me love for you 
 And you put it down on me 
 And I only wanna be with you 
 But then you stop calling me

 I got to figure out what to do just to get back up with you 
 Everyday I'm hoping then I pray that one day 
 You come back and bring your love my way 
 I'm talking everynight I sit and wonder why 
 Now baby you put it on me but now you don't want me 
 Tell me what I got to do what I got to prove show my love to you 
 I'll do whatever to get one more night 'cause I'm craving for me some you

 And I thought everything was cool
