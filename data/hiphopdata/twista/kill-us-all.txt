I feel Like, I feel Like Standing in the midst of a hundred thousand haters, 
 Dynamite and C-4 strapped around the waist bloody tears in my eyes 
 Hit the swich making sure any mother fucka in tha vicinity 
 Blow away and die, 
 Kill'em off with an explosion 
 Get up bitches, 
 Kamikaze on you hoes I'm the sacrificial lamb, 
 Feelin' the fury flow out of every follicle in my body 
 While you decompose Die with a blunt of dro in yo hand, 
 I'm uppin the itchy fo fuckin' wit Twista 
 If you fuckin' wit me come bet so cause it won't 
 Be an issue-Got some nuts to come get me 
 Then boy you gone get the picture put the flame in my 
 Swisher Then hollows penetrate through yo tissue 
 Fuck yo fit up wit yo blood as I hear the cries 
 Of yo homies screamin revenge 
 Got no mercy on them either go to war wit the 
 Intentions to annialate everything you stand for 
 Wit the death of myself 'cause I'm a believer 
 The blessings of sacrifice the messenger who 
 Cometh after the Christ next 1 to glisten after ice 
 Fuckin' wit me is a bigger gamble then a pack of dice 
 I'll murder you and come at you again in the after life 
 My brother you can't bring harm wit guns I'm 
 Armed wit bombs fuck all that shit you carry I got 
 Yo obituary a muthafuckin phenomenon-'cause I'mma come 
 Till they put all of us in a cemetery 
 Now come and look into the mind of a man you don't really wanna 
 Fuck wit 
 (Kill'em all (3x) 
 Looking death between the eyes and no one can save us 
 Sucide on you hoes if I have to, to make you die bitch 
 Kill us all (3x) 
 Looking death between the eyes and no one can save us 
 (2nd verse Twista) 
 Go to war like I'm untochable yellin' out bloody murder 
 While I'm bustin' you 2 deadly fingers squeezing twin 
 Triggers steady touchin you screamin like a demon 
 Like I'm finger fuckin' you 
 Just put my body in a room wit the enemy and I got 
 A grenade I'mma pull the pin out the sum bitch 
 Pop 17 sins out the gun clip smoking dro so fire 
 I was on 10 after 1 bligg 
 Nigga you have now entered the chainsaw massacre 
 Takin' more blood than a 2000 dracula slip the clip in the 
 Automatic and get to bustin' horrific hollows while you 
 Prayin' to Jesus of Nazarus 
 A 7 day theory like makaveli flowin on a track that's 
 Scary wit a Mack in the back of the pelle 
 Spectacular how could you dare me I'm already willing to die 
 I'm comin' back after they bury me 
 Its time for yo confessions I be the priest 
 Celebrate and salute the sign of a suicidal soldier 
 Better become a bible holder as I start to massacre 
 Men with a verbal recital that's colder 
 Deaths coming closer as you let kamikazi 
 Enter yo body careful or you die standin vertical 
 And anyone that opposes I swear to God I'mma get you 
 Even if I gotta murder me to murder you
