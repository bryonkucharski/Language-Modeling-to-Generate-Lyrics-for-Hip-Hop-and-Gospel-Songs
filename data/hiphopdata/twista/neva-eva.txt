 'Cause if ya fuckin' step, I'ma step in yo vicinity 
 What, you think I'm a ho nigga please you ain't on my level 
 Get some rank bitch while I'm diggin' ya grave with a shovel 
 Time after time I ask myself is it really clever 
 For you to get with me, bitch nigga you can neva eva 
 You ain't on my level, I'm pushin' Chevrolet pedal 
 If you niggas fuck with me I got that chrome, heavy metal

 Always slizzle makin' sho' I stay gone 
 Call us some broad to the Geor-Georgia Dome 
 Tryin' to get with me is like naps through a comb 
 They call me Don P AKA Corlio 
 Up in the club with my Cartier's on 
 Don't know if I'm high, drunk, or gettin' my roll on 
 He on the cell "Can ya hear me" hell nah

 Bitch nigga step the fuck back and if ya think I'm jokin' 
 Ask some niggas who tried to play us, 
 See em' lyin' off in the coffin 
 Trillville, ATL swangin' swangin' throwin' bows 
 Got some niggas that be hatin' bustin' slugs at my foes 
 If ya thinkin' you can fuck with a nigga like me 
 Nah nigga get rich, Trillville and BME 
 What the fuck you talkin' about "What you deep" nigga what! 
 If a hater want to hate then a hater gettin' bust 
 We ain't hard to find nigga so why ya steadily talkin' shit 
 I'm fixin' to sick my dogs on 'em 
 Pussy nigga, get bit boy 
 'Bout cut out ya brains when I spit this verse 
 I'm a blood suckin' vampire, my venom is worse 
 Head bustas deal with dangerous thirsts 
 Shatter ya bones in ya chest and make ya motherfuckin' heart burst 
 Don't worry now, Prince of the South on the map 
 Knock yo' thoughts out and leave yo brains in ya lap 
 Don't touch my Kango shorty, what's wrong with you 
 I might cock my fist back and knock yo grill through 
 Bitch nigga you can neva eva, eva eva 
 Eva eva, eva eva eva eva
