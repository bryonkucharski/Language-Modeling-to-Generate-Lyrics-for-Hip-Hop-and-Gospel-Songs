 Don't wanna see you with no pistols if you ain't ready to roll n*gga (put down that 45) 
 Don't wanna see you with no pistols if you ain't ready to roll n*gga (gotta let that 40 ride) 
 Don't wanna see you with no pistols if you ain't ready to roll n*gga (let's do a homicide) 
 Don't ever wanna see you with no pistols if you ain't ready to roll n*gga 
 Twista: 
 Don't wanna see you with that 45 unless you gon' ride 
 If I say you gon' die motherfucker I get so loud 
 What you be procrastinating I think you fuck around with pistols 'cause they fascinating 
 You motherfuckers ain't gon' do nothing 
 When you get through frontin niggas out here already know that you ain't gon' shoot nothing 
 End up at the pearly gates when they test you 
 Gotta dirty face but what you know about a 30 ain't special shit 
 And I know them hard words make you jump up with your? when you got the mosburg pump bitch 
 And the shortys lookin' at you like a punk bitch 
 Cause you ain't making what you claim ain't gon' dump click 
 You gon cry when you hear them bullets dumping when them shortys come and ride on you (when the pistol click clack) 
 If you still alive will you really get the dumpin if you got that 45 on you? 
 Mayz: 
 Once upon a time in the sha there was three real killas who bust guns and puff fire 
 They cut weight by the key and baggin every gram 
 Instead? bustin' with the pistol in they hand 
 I'm preachin murder like a vicious reverand 
 About niggas who claim they shootin but they never seen 357s 
 Now what reason would you hold it up 
 Put that pistol down nigga pick that weed up roll it up 
 Twista up the light you don't really won die 
 Stop your blood clot crying 
 Your bullets don't fly 
 ? Aim smooth? I keep that smith and wessel with me like I'm blackmoon 
 Toss up the living room storm through the kitchen 
 I caught that nigga in the bathroom shittin and pissin' 
 What you shakin' for I thought you said you ready to ride 
 Don't be coming with me if you ain't strapped because I 
 Liffy Stokes: 
 I keep a p95 nine milli ruger 
 You fuckin' with a shooter 
 Quick to bloody your suit up 
 My aim impeccable point like a decibel 
 300 feet away in a tower snipin a festival 
 What you know about 9's and glock 40's 
 And 45's see our 15's with the 5 pound slide 
 Thirty shot clips snub noses with the rubber grips 
 Wicked techs that'll put the kiss of death on your lover's lips 
 [? ] We get the squeeze nigga 
 Ak-47s make them bitches retreat nigga 
 Like a g nigga 
 I make 'em bleed nigga 
 ? I'm bustin' that's on my c nigga 
 My war chest is filled with ballers and techs 
 Ski masks gloves and vests so nigga what's next nigga 
 It's real thuggin' you a bitch to the bone 
 If you ain't go through nothin' shorty leave them pistols alone
