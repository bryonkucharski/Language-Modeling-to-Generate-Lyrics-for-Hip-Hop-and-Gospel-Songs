The perfect storm is Twista and Chris Brown ya dig 
 I got a new one for ya 
 Lets make a movie baby 
 Twista got cars 
 Big swagger 
 I'm a rock star like Mick Jagger 
 And I got bars that I spit faster 
 You a hot star no bitch badder 
 So let me take you on a ride 
 On a journey with the one that you call daddy 
 Who gon make you get it wet 
 But this time we gon do something romantic and different 
 I'll tell you about it when we get on the movie set 
 I was thinking that we could just make a sex tape 
 Plus I think yo face cute when it's a HD 
 Maybe I could tape you and you could tape me 
 When I pull my h2 up to your h3 
 You know that you want to be in this movie 
 So don't be acting like a trippin' with a stranger mission 
 Recording you while you lovin' me down below 
 Switching the camera angle when we change positions 
 You could be the director aiming the camera down at me 
 Filming me licking until you say cut 
 Ready for any footage you wanna get 
 Ain't gotta call nobody else because 
 I do my own stunts 
 It's the X rated version of a box office hit 
 I see you ready to strip for this 
 So let me get the music in, get the tape in, get the cameras in (oh oh oh oh) 
 Baby we don't need no script for this 
 I'ma throw a couple thousand baby strip for this 
 Let me pull my camera and make a movie yeah 
 Starring you and me yeah 
 Baby we don't need no actresses 
 Let me tell you what I'm working with, I'ma break your back with this 
 Let me pull my camera out lets make a movie yeah 
 Starring you and me yeah yeah, girl 
 Shawty we gon make a movie 
 Got me lovin' it when I'm feelin' on the booty 
 Especially when I can blame it on the alcohol 
 'Cause it do some thing to me 
 She look better than any chick in my perimeter 
 Sexy, I wish I could film every bit of her 
 Kiss her neck down to her stomach and then I'ma 
 Tell her we could be in a personal cinema 
 I let you hold the camera first and then I hold it then 
 'Cause I wanna see how its coming out and goin' in 
 Let you see such a freak in me, I hope this never leak on TMZ this is 50 world star or CNN 
 Baby girl you kick the world off the axis 
 I'm yo director, filming you for practice 
 And you know I think you a hell of a actress 
 Especially when I'm shooting you on a matress 
 Shawty straight to the top that's where we headed 
 And I'ma see my name in the credits 
 And be the shit if you let it 
 See somethin' that you not really feelin' 
 Then we can always go back and make an edit 
 I'll be sippin on patron platinum 
 She knew about the rapping 
 But didn't know I'd be on acting 
 Now a personal reality show 
 So then, get the tape in, get the cameras in (oh oh oh oh) 
 Baby we don't need no script for this 
 I'ma throw a couple thousand baby strip for this 
 Let me pull my camera and make a movie yeah 
 Starring you and me yeah 
 Baby we don't need no actresses 
 Let me tell you what I'm working with, I'ma break your back with this 
 Let me pull my camera out lets make a movie yeah 
 Starring you and me yeah yeah 
 Girl.
