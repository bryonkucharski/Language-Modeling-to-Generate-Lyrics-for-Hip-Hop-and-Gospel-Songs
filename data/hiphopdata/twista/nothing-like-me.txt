 He don't do the things like I, do he? 
 He don't make you feel like I, do he? Do he? 
 He don't drive the car I drive, do he? 
 He ain't gettin' money like I, do he? Do he?

 Every minute I be in it 
 Every minute I be in it, I be killin' competition 
 Watch I break 'em from the start to the finish 
 I make 'em start to diminish and body anybody 
 Makin' a comment about me the way I don't like 
 Disgruntled motherfuckers and suckers, today we call 'em haters 
 I'm so major, hoes on me and they wanna fight 
 They wanna bite 'cause I'm original like Bobby Digital 
 My style is critical and yours intermediate 
 I'm just a rappin' legacy, I got the recipe 
 For cookin up and servin', and they likin the ingredients 
 I'm mackin', I'm a genius, a flow of horror, I could peep your 
 Aura and see what your inner feelings might be 
 Niggas talkin' shit 'cause they ain't used to bein' 
 In the same room with a legendary nigga like me 
 Some of 'em really wanna be me and they want my car, ho 
 And they flow like me 
 Niggas wanna take away my style, they can get it how I get it 
 But they money never grow like me though 
 How I live it is exquisite and the picture is so vivid that the riches 
 Are not only monetary but within the body and the mental 
 Spectacular graphics in back of a plethora of energy 
 Vocally vibratin rhythms through a instrumental 
 Spit and tellin' niggas you don't really want it 
 Bitches you don't really want it 
 Think I'm dissin even when it's hypothetical and I ain't really on it 
 I'm known to body my opponents 
 Should I say opposition, in my position I'm expected to be venomous 
 I beat 'em down verbally the way I rap 
 Like it was multiples of me, I fuck 'em up like it was ten of us 
 And this ain't even strenuous

 He don't do the things like I, do he? 
 He don't make you feel like I, do he? Do he? 
 He don't drive the car I drive, do he? 
 He ain't gettin' money like I, do he? (Ain't do it like me) Do he? 
 He don't do the things like I, do he? 
 He don't make you feel like I, do he? Do he? 
 Give a fuck 'bout how you feel nigga (feel nigga) 
 She gon' pop the thang for real nigga, nigga

 Every second I be intimate 
 Every second I be intimate with the music 
 As I get into it and every rhythm in the instrument 
 Intelligently ignorant the way I spit it 
 Admit it, I'd be admitted into the hospital 
 If I didn't know how I spit'll be the conversation of lyricists 
 Congregation'll fit with this, I'll leave you volatile 
 If you got a style you prob'ly got it from hearin Twist 
 A certain section of my '97 patterns 
 My 2004 lyrics, how they copy 
 Cadences and mannerisms, I can tell it when I hear it 
 I can tell it when I hear it 
 And I'm never specific 'cause if I do 
 A nigga gon' take it the wrong way 
 I'll fuck him up for whatever he gon' say 
 Dependin on who he be I'm thuggin' like I'm PeeWee Longway 
 Blowin' after a long day 
 And I want my haze, kush 
 And my diesel too 
 How you ain't gon' have nothin' to roll up with me 
 If you gon' fuck with me if I be blowin' weed with you though? 
 Old fake-ass niggas, they be the reason I don't fuck with them 
 All over the dick when they see the Gucci 
 I just roll one up and say rest in peace to Doe B 
 Blowin' for when they free my lil' brother and free Lil Boosie
