(Johnny P) 
 Let me play with your emotions 
 (Twista) 
 Well a motherfucker could never control me, only squeeze me and hold me 
 That's what the hoe came up and told me 
 Now is she bold G? But in my mouth is where the gold be 
 'Cause I be pimpin' her like Goldie 
 Gotta get paid in this age my fingers ain't made 
 Just to be choppin up confetti with, if it's already thick 
 You better study nigga if you ain't with it you can get it 
 'Cause I ain't even on that petty shit 
 So who the fuck do I competi with? 
 The rhythm I kick, is like a rhythmly-wicked-arith-a-metic 
 Pick 'em up quick and then give 'em the dick, thinkin' I'm innocent 
 They up in the mall shoppin' for me pickin' a fit 
 I got them heffer's nose red 
 And when we get in the bed, I be leavin' 'em with rose legs 
 Stuffin that made 'em wanna pose dead 
 But you already got 'em until you get up in them hoes head 
 I don't mean to sound bogus or nothin' 
 But it's the bomb when I be havin' them cuties thinkin' 
 I'm in love with em, when I'm rubbin em 
 Be gettin' pub with em, in a club with em 
 Smokin' dub with em, huggin em, freakin in the tub with em 
 After gettin' paid from her she ain't trippin' 
 'Cause she know she got what she paid for 
 She honor my name, I gotta tame, here it go 
 Now we speakin' with the game on ways to make mo' 
 Chorus: repeat 2X 
 (Johnny P in background: let me play, with your emotions) 
 (Let me play with your) emotions hoe 
 To the rhythm of a hi-hat, take a puff and lie back 
 Let me stimulate your mind, body and soul, I know you want to try that 
 Now motherfucker can you buy that... 
 Tell me baby can you buy that 
 I got you under my complete control, you know it's worth more than 
 Diamonds and gold, now don't be bogus and deny that 
 Verse Two: Twista 
 Now how the fuck you gon' act hoe, I saw you creepin' out the back do' 
 What you runnin' from a mack fo'? Lay you on your back slow 
 Cause you know I got you with my lasso 
 Blow your mind like a afroCome and take a glimpse of the stairs 
 It's the aroma of a pimp in the air, I betcha notice the smell 
 It's like a lotus when I flow dis, cause my eyes be the lowest 
 If you didn't notice then you bogus as hell 
 I'm puttin' women under my spell, like I'm up in their brain 
 Pumpin their vein with game for the anatomy that's feminine 
 They're fillin 'em up with adrenaline, got 'em geekin 
 We're speakin' approachin up a pimp like a gentleman 
 Submission is surrenderin, it ain't no endin if it's on 
 With a blunt from the bomb side 
 In the right place, with the right mind and the right line 
 You can get a lifetime contract 
 They be wise until they look into your eyes 
 A shorty freaked when she spotted mine 
 Took her over to my crib, lay low, hit her off from behind 
 Then she signed on the dotted-line, the hoe was like 
 "Ooh Daddy... why you doin' me like this? 
 I'd do anything to be with you, you got me gone in the head" 
 Ya mind, I don't mean to make a disaster up 
 Like my Dad to master love 
 But if a motherfucker breakin you for every penny you earn 
 Then how could you still show the bastard love? 
 I guess it's 'cause I'm cold, shit 
 Thought you was gon' be spendin me I betcha think you sho' did 
 But game recognize game, now you lame in the brain 
 Stupid bitch that's what you get for tryin' to gold dig, now 
 Yeah, this be Hype, the Verbal Tantrum 
 Kickin it with my man Twista 
 If you should suck my soul 
 I should make your funky emotions 
 Nothin' is good unless you play with it 
 Play with me baby 
 Verse Three: Twista 
 I know you think it's blasphemy 
 But won't you give up when she ask for me? After he passed the beat 
 Since you said I was your Magesty, I had to see 
 And when you get paid, there is some cash for me, is it a tragedy 
 That I can get her so gone, the hoe be trippin' talkin' up her love a lot 
 But the only love I got, is when I'm grippin like I wanna hug the Glock 
 Or when I rub the twat, or pickin' up a dub at spots 
 Fuck the hoe thugs, the clubs, and the phony perpetrators with dimes 
 The speed knots match voo-Do or Die, Psycho Drama, Crucial Conflict 
 Be pimpin' with 'em gators and dons, collect the papers and dolls 
 Player haters remarks will get smoked to a blunt dust 
 Sso keep walkin' the next time you hear grown folks talkin' 
 Motherfuckers betta shut the fuck up, 'cause we make the women suck up 
 You insist to be trippin' while we be gamin like Don Juan 
 What up the filet minion, the grey poupon 
 Them hoes are staked to charm, because we make the bomb 
 Now I don't mean no harm, but either come on in or get on gone 
 And let me pull my pouch of snuff 
 In between your thighs, come take a pull and vibe 
 And let your tongue go coastin low, now
