 (Turtle Banxx) 
 Picture this shit you facing 
 Totalin body and murderous situations against nations we organize like maces 
 Got killers patiently waitin 
 Different places you facing the yellow taping and federal x with graces 
 We ruinin your reputation 
 Momma in the hospital pacing for every shot you taking 
 The doctors can't stop the shaking 
 See faces blazin' 
 Like the sun of Satan like a gun that gets nathan 
 What you expect? (say what) 
 Like a neutron on deck (yeah) 
 Nigga you gonna catch rays (ha) 
 You confess let's get cash and thangs (ugh huh) 
 Smokin' flash and range 
 'Cause we mash and bang 
 Till the vet we slay (ah) 
 Motherfucker, let it reign 
 (Bennie Franks) 
 Now they knowing that we mash and bang 
 Texas 380 in this cash for cash and mask 
 Y'all then fucked up now 
 Let the south and west connect 
 We snatch a soul out ya better chosen swiss cheese your Avirex 
 What's up now? 
 Me and my nigga Turtle cown (?) 
 To late to rehearse nigga (shit) thangs looking shitty now 
 Pass ya a Phillie pal 
 I'm all up in ya now 
 And when I blast you hear (gunshot) 
 Feeling me now? 
 What I feel for the opponent 
 Smell the aroma 
 Well come swim with these killa piranhas 
 Sharin heat orders slash g's and fours 
 Street patrollers can't run when the gasket blows 
 Your caskets close 
 My eyes open 
 You fuck around and get John Blaze now ya broken 
 And now I'm hoping you escape before crimes broken braids on the gallery 
 Fat too many calories I'm ghost Mickey and Mallory 
 (Turtle Banxx)

 (Todd Nitty) 
 Can't help it to be bogus man 
 You know the game 
 Got me tighter than a choker chain 
 For flashing thang 
 Cash but raps and caine 
 All my thugs grab them thangs 
 'Cause we gonna mash and bang 
 Mash and tame 
 (Turtle Banxx) 
 Botherly we and bodies sippin voscie voscily dick the hottie 
 Properly lick a shottie nut up switch a party to a Jason scene 
 Cut up everybody scream "To Shut Up Everybody" 
 Juss means you what up big body? 
 My association with fornication got me exposin tricks 
 Negotiatin motivation for my disposal 
 Body bog 
 Put the mask on fuck it take the mask off 
 Open fire blast motherfuckers then we mash on 
 For the change we bang and the thangedest chain 
 If the nights then the name medallion then blow out his brain 
 Same mobster and baller hit the casino click the revolvers 
 Heat in casinos Turtle Banxx and Bennie Franks 
 G.O. Deniro fuck Denaro 
 Mash the pedal to the metal 
 Ain't no swashing we heartless bang to this settle 
 You ain't walking the austin and departing the ghetto carchers (?) 
 Some bledo when when the pistols echo and serve to protect em 
 (Bennie Franks) 
 Fuck them niggas hollerin heat with they narrow barrels 
 I got killers that'll bang Jason in math terror 
 Your replacements ask Nicholas Cage where ya face went 
 Fake ass hation hanging butt naked in my basement 
 Dip 'em in honey hang 'em hot 
 Y'all adjacent vanilla ounce truce let 'em fly 
 That'll erase em 
 Should have ran before we cocked back loaded and aim 
 Bennie Franks and Turtle Banxx we mash and bang
