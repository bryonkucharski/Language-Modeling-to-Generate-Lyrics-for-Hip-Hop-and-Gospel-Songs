I am such a Mobsta 
 The Bible says "Ye shall prosper" 
 I am such a Mobsta 
 The Bible says "Ye shall prosper" 
 So come and bow down to royalty 
 Kiss both of my cheeks to show loyalty 
 The flow is ceremonial, the style of rituals so be cordial 
 And please act accordingly 
 This ain't a legend or folklore 
 Chi-raq violence is real, not a Cold War 
 But in the streets call it coke wars 
 And do not open your mouth unless you spoke for 
 Please Father forgive me 
 I had to give him two to the kidney 
 Didn't know that I was nice 
 Any night I perform like Rice - Jerry, Sydney 
 Ray too, hangin' out with Windy City gratefuls 
 In the back of the club we play pool 
 Only real niggas 'cause they cool 
 And who did bids and didn't snitch and stayed true 
 But now-a-days family come first 
 Shorties out here is gettin' killed over turf 
 Well if the meek shall inherit the earth 
 Tell me why I gotta know what a hundred bricks is worth? 
 ...Ah, flow so gorgeous 
 The coldest to ever touch a cordless 
 I'm on the streets Forbes List 
 And with the rhymes I'm divine like Osiris, Horus 
 It's a clash of the titans 
 Warriors on the street blastin and fightin' 
 Seen it all, been a part of it all 
 Don't get it twisted if I'm on a different path when I'm writin 
 I am such a Mobsta 
 The Bible says "Ye shall prosper" 
 I am such a Mobsta 
 The Bible says "Ye shall prosper" 
 Blowin' loud by the quarter 
 Conversations about what's up with a porter 
 We can sit down at the table, but first 
 You gotta kiss the pinky ring, it's according to the order 
 My niggas show me how much to cut it with 
 And what to do when the kitchen was the workplace 
 Bring the pot over the stove to a boil 
 Comin' out the crib smellin like burnt paste 
 As the Lord is my witness 
 I done seen so many end up on the hitlist 
 Shootin the car till it slow down 
 And now I see nothin' but lifeless, stiffness, hit this 
 Three-eighty in the headset 
 Bricks in the dashboard and the door panels 
 Give me the ball nigga, hand check 
 Niggas can't ball 'cause they got poor handles 
 So with a wave of the hand 
 I'ma gain green if I offer them work 
 Create a chain of command 
 Don't try to talk to me unless you talk to him first 
 ...In God we trust 
 And it ain't another Mob like us 
 Pocket full of eightballs on the bus 
 To undercovers I say what's up in the truck 
 Whole team full of bravado 
 Gettin' money since niggas that wore Movado 
 Rollin' in a Cadillac El Dorado 
 Bubble Lexus or the all-black Tahoe 
 Why?
