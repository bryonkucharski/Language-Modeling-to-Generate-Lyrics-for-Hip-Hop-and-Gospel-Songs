(Featuring Sting) 
 Verse 1:(Twista) 
 Stickin late out night in the evening 
 But it was like the sun was still beaming 
 When I saw the 7-4-5 gotta get inside 
 That's wat I'm thinkin' 
 Nothing but a wire in my jacket 
 Tried to get up the courage to do it 
 All it takes is a splitsecond to pursuit and get into it 
 Move ahead with misson, hotwire the igniton 
 Trying to be quick with the procedure 
 Look around in my suspitions 
 Get the guts 'cause I make my mind feel like it's what I deserve 
 In the car on and empty street as I tell myself don't be scurred 
 A poor little boy buts it's like when I see through this man's eye's 
 I feel as good as I ever felt up in this rich man's ride 
 So I just start it up quickly to make it harder to come get me 
 Even thought I've done this before 
 It's like I took a part of him with me 
 But he ain't lossin no sleep and I'm steady cruzin and creepin' 
 Breakin no rules and no weaving 
 While I get away smooth belly breathing 
 Slowly I get outta sight when I take another player for a lil ride 
 Lets go to the car to pick up speeders 
 I drive away through the night, through the night 
 Chorus:(Sting) 
 Please take me dancing tonight 
 I've been all on my own 
 You promise one day we could 
 It's what you said on the phone 
 I'm just a prisoner of love 
 Always head from the light 
 Take me Dancing 
 Please take me dancing tonight 
 Verse 2:(Twista) 
 First I invison myself as Twista rollin' slick through the hood 
 Saw me hurting at first but now I sit on leather and wood 
 Steady waving at the shortays 'cause I know I'm lookin' cool 
 Gettin' visions about the life of the man who's car I stole 
 When I'm on the streets like fire as a speedy tire I like it 
 As I invision myself in this likeness like I'm a psychic 
 Now I see things hes doing wondering if hes living his life 
 Hes a company man who's out at night with two kids and a wife 
 His complications with the new marriage leaving her embarrassed 
 Like his trust ain't no longer cherished with well then how's the love get damaged 
 Like telling her he's living his life alone in his room 
 When in the car you could smell the trace of another womans perfume, perfume 
 Chorus:(Sting) 
 Please take me dancing tonight 
 I've been all on my own 
 You promise one day we could 
 It's what you said on the phone 
 I'm just a prisoner of love 
 Always head from the light 
 Take me Dancing 
 Please take me dancing tonight 
 When he could call ha 
 Thought he was about la 
 And a bitch I call la 
 Soon as he saw her 
 Verse 3:(Twista) 
 But when he get home will he be able to cover up all of his eyes 
 As the voice of his lonely mistress started ringing in ma eyes 
 Chorus: 2X (Sting) 
 Please take me dancing tonight 
 I've been all on my own 
 You promise one day we could 
 It's what you said on the phone 
 I'm just a prisoner of love 
 Always head from the light 
 Take me Dancing 
 Please take me dancing tonight
