I heard they had yo ass down at the station all mothafuckin day man 
 -Hell yeah 
 Some interogation shit the police and shit 
 -Hell yeah man the pussy mothafuckas hittin on me and shit man 
 Straight up 
 -Hell yeah but if you don't say shit they don't know shit man 
 Shit mothafucka don't never say nothin' be all type of mothafuckin unsolved 
 Mysterys and shit happenin' round here 
 -Hell mothafuckin yeah 
 I know a whole bunch of motherfuckers that's prepared whoop 
 Leave a body bloody red to scoop 
 Poppin' off lead for loot 
 Shot the pussy up from head to boot 
 Just for talkin' dramatic when it was static you was scared to shoot 
 Police prepared to swoop 
 To catch a nigga on the runway but don't none stay for the white chalk 
 If error out tha tip whatch your lip niggas pipes talk 
 If you wasn't seen then you might walk 
 Even if it ain't the time of day niggas will find a way like locos off of nodoz 
 Careful where you servin' your blows because those hos 
 Got the popos posin as hobos 
 Take a photo of him please 
 Tell the Chi Town he freeze they don't give a fuck if it was DT's 
 They be up like the sea breeze on CC's 
 And they handin out these murders like free cheese 
 Could you pass me the B please 
 I got intercate shit to kick even though I campaign with a gang 
 Bumpin though in different denominations in the nations, 
 And the nations racin worried bacause I'm slangin these thangs 
 If you can hang up at my town up a K Town 
 If you dissin them then you dissin me 
 Niggas actin' like they glad to die so if you had to try, 
 If they faded you it wouldn't mean shit to me 
 Just a unsolved mystery 
 Before I saw his body lyin' down 
 I heard a motherfucker crying now 
 Have you ever seen a bitch nigga give into mysery 
 And left an unsolved mystery 
 Before I saw his body lyin' down 
 I heard a motherfucker crying now 
 Call the popo the man and mess 
 Shot up his head and chess 
 Put to rest now the rest should be history 
 Before I saw his body lyin' down 
 I heard a motherfucker crying now 
 Have you ever seen a bitch nigga give into mysery 
 And left an unsolved mystery 
 Before I saw his body lyin' down 
 I heard a motherfucker crying now 
 Niggas actin' like they glad to die 
 So if you had to try 
 If they faded you it wouldn't mean shit to me 
 (2nd vesre) 
 In a hoopty shorty's will design a spot 
 So when the get pulled over them people wouldn't find the spot 
 But if you ain't got it hid you have the flowest 
 If you can throw it and motherfucker it's a nine or not 
 Just go back to where your thang lay 
 Cause lo key niggas they started out in the gang way 
 But if you wild when your aim spray 
 Them niggas that you aired out is gonna be comin' back the same day 
 In the middle of a war you ain't on the tip 
 If you get the guns and clips to keep doin' what you doin' 
 Is it the same chiefs that got the same beef 
 Claimin they ain't been doin' but be givin' it to 'em 
 Flamboyant niggas must be slow 
 If your bitch ain't get popped then it's a blessin she a lucky hoe 
 Cause no matter where the fuck he go 
 In K Town they will dress him in a casket and tuxedo 
 Cause you can't be actin' thug roof 
 Because of Hennesey and drug use these niggas love juice 
 Some don't even considered gettin' caught 
 'Cause when you talk up some shit the gonna be quick and let the slugs loose 
 These motherfuckers heart is love boo 
 Especially like them niggas up at Ghostown Windy City snipe 
 'Cause it's a pitty when hype 
 For niggas wanna get witty 
 For comin' too pretty 
 Get the chilli filled and desipher 
 To pay the piper and bow to viper 
 Twice is rough 
 Now is what I'm kickin hype enough 
 Cause every time I puff and write this stuff 
 I kick a frenzy facin fuckin' and fury 'cause I don't like to bluff 
 So if we ever get into it and let the static get to me 
 Lets squash it and make it history 
 Niggas actin' like the glad to die 
 So if you had to try 
 If they faded you it wouldn't mean shit to me 
 Just an unsolved mystery 
 (3rd verse) 
 Now listen they be kickin hocus pocus 
 I done said shit to put your motherfucking eyes out of focus 
 So writing what I wrote is hopeless 
 If you see our base and you said then you better be ferosheous 
 And matter fact I hope the dopest 
 For to try to cope this is hopeless 
 Cause my lethal rhymes 
 Is the kind that can beat you blind 
 And pre-design 
 I pee through mine 
 Like I see through lines 
 Check the brain and see define 
 The reason I'm gunnin I tried the runnin' 
 'Cause I should have let you know 
 I don't give a fuck you was fronted because you was blunted 
 West side to the hunters you can't step to hoe 
 In the state of emergency urgenlty the ambulance will come 
 And then the law will come demand the gun 
 But bullshit irrelevence they need evidence 
 Or trippin' on elegance they be holdin' out they hands for some 
 If anything they'll hand 'em some 
 Or get wit him here come the victum he be shot up in his pants and lungs 
 'Cause he actin' hard and ran his tongue 
 Don't mean another nigga he meet in the street gonna be the man to run 
 Cause a prison is some shit to see 
 Matter of fact fuck the talkin' my lip let me hit the B 
 Niggas actin' like they glad to die 
 So if you had to try 
 If they faded you it wouldn't mean shit to me 
 Just an unsolved mystery
