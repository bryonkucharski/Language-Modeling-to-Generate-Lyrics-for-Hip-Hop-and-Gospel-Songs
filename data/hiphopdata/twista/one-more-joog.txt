(Don Juan and Twista) 
 One more joog, one more 
 Joog (one mo') 
 Nigga, I'm turnin', turn up! 
 One more joog (guap) 
 Ay (money) 
 Drank, turn up! 
 One more joog (count what?) 
 One mo', one mo' drank, drank (this ain't for the rappers) 
 Nigga, drank (this for the ones that be joogin, Twista) 
 (Don Juan) 
 One more joog 
 My niggas be trappin, straight out the land though 
 Red bandanna, lookin' like Rambo 
 Used to be walkin', now I'm in Lambos 
 Still pullin joog after joog, light yo' black out like a candle 
 All I need is one mo', all I need is one mo' 
 E'rybody lay down, what you think that I come fo'? 
 Joogin, ridin' 'round just lookin' (one mo' joog, gimme one mo' joog!) 
 I'm joogin, ridin' 'round just lookin' (one mo' joog, gimme one mo' joog!) 
 One mo' joog 
 (Twista) 
 Twista, I'm a winner 
 Joogin in a city full of motherfuckin killers 
 Fuckin' with them niggas on the corner servin' pillars 
 And they get it every morning from the summer to the winter 
 With a pocket full of figures and I got the hood of niggas 
 And a banana clip for the gorillas 
 Throw up a middle finger for whoever don't feel us 
 Matter fact, if we have to we'd be comin' after your dinner 
 I'ma drop a joog on you niggas right now 
 What you spendin 35 hundred for a pound? 
 I'ma take it 35 hundred joog 35 times 
 Make it 35 muh'fuckin' pounds 
 C-c-city full of niggas that be misunderstood 
 And I might come and stick you up if you got the goods 
 Come in here talkin' that shit, I wish a nigga would 
 You wanna know what they on when you in the hood

 I could joog your tax 
 I'll make a quick hundred racks with that wire 
 Then flip it and bring it back 
 And make a few hundred stacks with that fire 
 Put the K roll in the Ac' 
 I roll one and sit back because I'm waitin' on a hundred units 
 And if I don't come up off of that 
 I'm servin' the dummy pack and face the drama when I run into it 
 Ain't nothin' like us 
 Gotta send a shout to the lifers 
 Roll in the Camaro with the car crackers 
 In the club poppin' bottles with the swipers 
 Shoutout to my plug 
 Let's get it - shoutout to my shooters 
 My shooters got shooters 
 My hitters got hitters and they got bazookas on
