(Twista) 
 You ever seen what a real nigga look like? 
 Sittin' in the Lamborghini lower than the black 'vette 
 With a pocket full of money lookin' for a honey 
 Stuntin and never trippin' on nothin' 'cause I got that 
 Exquisite taste, chase paper, capers on my résumé 
 And where I lay might get a little bit, lonely 
 On the grind, so I be missin' the feelin' 
 Of a woman touchin' me and layin' all up on me 
 But I see you got the make-up and the tendencies 
 A complete understandin' that a nigga gotta work 
 Even though she be havin' a attitude 
 I tell her "You ain't gotta curse baby, I'ma buy the purse" 
 I feel like she a fly bitch 
 The only one I wanna see in fly kicks 
 And I want her to be mine so I spit her some game 
 From a nigga guaranteed to die rich

 You can be my ride or die chick, I be on my shit 
 I be gettin' paper, paper, girl 
 You so bad you so damn thick, and I be on my shit 
 I be gettin' paper, paper, girl 
 I be on my shit, I be on my shit 
 I be on my shit 
 You so bad you so damn thick, and I be on my shit 
 I be gettin' paper, paper, girl

 Go 'head and put it where you wanna put it 
 And while you at it let me get some footage 
 And it ain't no need for you askin' me could it 
 'Cause when we get in our mode I'ma show you how good it 
 Gets, because I be on my shit 
 And I be doin' my thang nobody better than this 
 Come if you ready to hang you wanna be with the Twist? 
 Would you be with it if I wanna travel and take you into the abyss? 
 Give me the word and I'ma cuff 
 'Cause I be feelin' like we've both been waitin' long enough 
 You got that loud pack pussy other bitches huff 
 Deep inside sweet and sexy but you act tough 
 That's what I need on my team 
 Somebody gettin' it that I can fuck and spoil with some fly shit 
 And I really feel like she can be my sidekick 
 My gettin' high chick my ride or die chick 
 Let's go 
 (Dra Day) 
 You can be my ride or die chick, I be on my shit 
 I be gettin' paper, paper, girl 
 You so bad you so damn thick, and I be on my shit 
 I be gettin' paper, paper, girl 
 I be on my shit, I be on my shit 
 I be on my shit 
 You so bad you so damn thick, and I be on my shit 
 I be gettin' paper, paper, girl 
 (Dra Day) 
 I know you can tell by the 30's that I'm sittin' on 
 Take a whiff of this shit, this Dolce 
 Mix it up with the purp, it's okay 
 Later on I'm free to lay, lay 
 Lay anywhere you want 
 Just say the word and I swear that it's gon' be on 
 I be on my jungle shit, baby no lie 
 Freak you like an animal from the backside 
 Got the bomb shit, shawty that'll change your life 
 Feels so damn good I'ma make you cry 
 Oh, hold up, wait a minute 
 Seizin' up, and I'm in it 
 Now pull it out, I'ma finish 
 Ooh yeah 
 (Dra Day) 
 You can be my ride or die chick, I be on my shit 
 I be gettin' paper, paper, girl 
 You so bad you so damn thick, and I be on my shit 
 I be gettin' paper, paper, girl 
 I be on my shit, I be on my shit 
 I be on my shit 
 You so bad you so damn thick, and I be on my shit 
 I be gettin' paper, paper, girl
