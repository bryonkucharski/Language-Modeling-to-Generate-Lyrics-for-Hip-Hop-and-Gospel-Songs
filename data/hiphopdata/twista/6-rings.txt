It's just me against the world and I won't lose 
 No I can't lose, I'm a born winner 
 These streets made a beast out of me 
 Six rings on my fingers 
 I'm a champion 
 Put your fives and your ones up 
 6 rings, I'm a champion 
 Getting money, put your ones up 
 6 rings I'm a champion 
 Now ball 
 Ball [x12] 
 6 rings I'm a champion 
 No worries, I been killing it since she was a shorty 
 Still standing on top of my glory, and this still ain't the end of my story 
 Confetti pouring, they be all in the clothes that I'm sporting 
 6 rings like Michael Jordan, same team no Robert Horry 
 Put me on the verbal court with my competitors 
 I'ma be fucking up all of them 
 Money like Steph Curry, and I dish it out to my team like Chris Paul and them (Griffin!) 
 So lose and you blame it on fouls and how they don't be calling them 
 I put in work, I got rings 
 You can't tell me nothing, I know I earned all of them 
 That winning feeling I want 'cause if I get the shot I bet I hit the shot 
 I'm in my glory while pouring champagne on my body like I was Chris Bosh 
 They won't admit it, how many times I came back and did it 
 They have no choice to be killing 'em when I spit it 
 Give me a standing ovation when I visit 
 Final four delivery, hall of fame flow 
 Right up in Nirvana is where my motherfucking hangs though 
 But I ain't finished yet, I'm the exquisite vet 
 They be like damn Twista they ain't knocked you off your pivot yet 
 Nope! 
 It's just me against the world and I won't lose 
 No I can't lose, I'm a born winner 
 These streets made a beast out of me 
 Six rings on my fingers 
 I'm a champion 
 Put your fives and your ones up 
 6 rings, I'm a champion 
 Getting money, put your ones up 
 6 rings I'm a champion 
 Now ball

 Who the fuck is you talking to? Nigga I got six rings 
 Swagging, my walk like I'm Jordan 
 I know when I'm hot, fingers look like Kareem 
 When I pull that whip up in front of the club I be knowing they seeing it 
 And whoever dissing this, 'cause they are fisherman watching the finals and we in it 
 The league of the streets 
 Winning the game with a three on the beat 
 Keeping that thang in the piano seat 
 One shot at your brain and they flee on their feet 
 Don't like you when you be like Michael 
 They run up thinking I be slipping 
 Long nose, 357 by my side, call me Scottie Pippen 
 And I'm on bullshit, call [?] about it, Willy said he southpaw 
 And I murder for the squad like an outlaw 
 Everything that I say coming out raw 
 Plenty niggas I know pulling up with a Glock and a key 
 Acting like they winning the game 
 Like they pulling up at the top of the key 
 But I got them accolades, and I spit that fast shit 
 You just an absurd sound, third round draft pick 
 And when I win the game, then right there is your history 
 Celebrate like we do in Chiraq, we gon' tear up the city 
 It's just me against the world and I won't lose 
 No I can't lose, I'm a born winner 
 These streets made a beast out of me 
 Six rings on my fingers 
 I'm a champion 
 Put your fives and your ones up 
 6 rings, I'm a champion 
 Getting money, put your ones up 
 6 rings I'm a champion 
 Now ball
