Girl you're too sexy 
 Come and sit with me in V.I.P. 
 With those curves and cocoa skin 
 Now where have you been 
 The tattoo on your belly's kinda hot 
 Them about a shorty in the spot 
 You came in with a man 
 But I'm making plaaans 
 To be next to you 
 Been checking out the rest and they just wont do 
 Pretty young thing in a lexus coupe 
 Been praying everyday to blessed with you (blessed with you) 
 But I am next to you 
 All I think about is undressing you 
 Playing all alone just to touch with you 
 Can we get it on in my bedroom 
 Would ya mind 
 Would ya mind 
 If I got to know ya better baby 
 You're my type 
 And I really really want you lady so 
 Make up your mind 
 Do you want him or do you want me 
 Take your time 
 Its all right, I don't mind 
 I see ya checking out my rings and the platinum watch 
 Your trying to figure out what I'm not 
 The keys to my range around my neck 
 And a legit royalty check 
 If ya looking for someone who has nice things 
 Someone to give ya all the love you need 
 Look no further I'm that man 
 And I got a plaaan 
 I wanna take ya home 
 Get ya all alone 
 Turn the lights down low 
 To a private show 
 Kiss ya from head to toe 
 Take off all your clothes 
 Throw 'em on the floor 
 Make a video 
 Baby come stay awhile 
 You can't deny 
 What ya feel inside 
 Its in your eyes 
 Make up your mind 
 Stop wasting time 
 Baby its all right 
 Would ya mind 
 I wanna take ya home 
 Get ya all alone 
 Turn the lights down low 
 To a private show
