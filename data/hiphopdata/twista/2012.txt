If tomorrow the world ends 
 And in the morning the sun don't seem to shine 
 I will stay here forever 
 Standing right by your side 
 You know they say (they say) that it's all gonna end some day 
 So, right before it does (right before it does) 
 Let's make love (let's make love) 
 Like tomorrow was 2012 
 The last day on Earth, 2012 
 The end of the world, 2012 
 You'll be my man and I'll be your girl 
 2012 x 7 
 Now they be telling me that these are the last days 
 Are we really that close to Armageddon 
 If living on the planet till this point has been hell 
 I survived 'cause I am legend 
 What if it's all about to be over 
 Then I'm gonna say you need to be my girlfriend 
 Hit the blunt after the world in the dim 
 Then you can get it in like the world fixin to end 
 It's predicted by the ancient Mayan civilization 
 I don't want to see the world go soon 
 But with such a beautiful girl in the room 
 I want to be up in you when the world go boom 
 Get down with your body till it's lights out 
 Making love till the terminator come 
 Global warming is having a major effect 
 Comfort each other but we don't know which way to run 
 Mother Earth is about to go to another cycle 
 And I know that is about to end someday (someday) 
 Right before it does (right before it does) 
 Let's make love (let's make love) 
 Like tomorrow was 2012 
 The end of the world, 2012 
 The last day on Earth, 2012 
 You'll be my man and I'll be your girl 
 2012 x 7 
 Tomorrow it's all about to be over 
 So I only live to serve ya 
 The dark is about to devour the Earth 
 So come and ride with the Silver Surfer 
 Now will it all in from the element 
 Of ether or artificial intelligence 
 As long as we both have the passion 
 The sex it just makes all the issues irrelevant 
 I know it's all about to go 
 So I just sit back and blow my dro 
 (Right before it does) 
 Steady looking at the clock, 
 Before we suffer let me make your body rock 
 Having sex till the big bomb drops 
 Or till the planet go pop 
 2012, The last day on Earth 
 2012, The end of the world 
 2012, You'll be my man and I'll be your girl
