(Tia London) 
 You know that it's yours, that it's yours, that it's yours, that it's yours, that it's yours, baby 
 You know that it's yours, that it's yours, that it's yours, that it's yours, that it's yours, baby 
 You know that it's yours, that it's yours, that it's yours, that it's yours, that it's yours, baby 
 You know that it's yours, that it's yours, that it's yours, that it's yours, that it's yours, baby 
 (Twista) 
 Let me get straight to it 
 Her body like a Bugatti, ain't nothing like a Buick 
 When we get passionate I'm in love with how you do it 
 No longer want to lease it, I want the title to it 
 I might have blew it but now I know I want to own it 
 And get rid of opponents but I know fame can be blind 
 Never knew nothing like it is so one of a kind 
 I know that it'll be stupid to not claim that it's mine 
 She fit me like a glove, hop up right on top of her man 
 And with no hands she give me a hug 
 Go ahead and reverse it baby you pop it like a drug 
 Asking me how I feel when I'm inside your love 
 Better than the mall 
 In other words whenever I'm up in your hall 
 I feel the ripples on the wall 
 A spectacular feeling when I get up in them draws 
 And with no hands she can even give an applause 
 Cause you got me gone, all I can say is "True that" 
 Whenever I put the soap hole inside you at 
 Snug, but you can see it's something you ain't new at 
 Ooh, I can feel it when you do that 
 I can feel it when you do that, she got a nigga stuck 
 Murder with the pussy now you just been cut 
 She got the kush in her bush and I'mma take a puff 
 Telling me that it's yours and I can't get enough 
 And she talkin' like 
 (Tia London) 
 Tell me that it's the one 
 Tell me baby it's the one you been waiting for 
 Tell me so I can make sure 
 Tell me baby 'cause you know that it's yours 
 Oh-whoa 
 You know that it's yours, that it's yours, that it's yours, that it's yours, that it's yours, baby 
 You know that it's yours, that it's yours, that it's yours, that it's yours, that it's yours, baby 
 You know that it's yours, that it's yours, that it's yours, that it's yours, that it's yours, baby 
 You Know that it's yours 
 (Twista) 
 She got a body like a Maserati 
 And she got the owochi cochi like a 'Rochi 
 Ass fuck her in the back of the Kawasaki 
 But the flow is a classic so it's probably a Harley 
 Hotty be better than any thot around here 
 I see you [?] that I can be your manager 
 My place so let me show you I can handle ya 
 Scarface, I fuck you right over the banister 
 And it's the way that you be telling me that its yours baby 
 How I'm a breath of fresh air, you been so bored lately 
 And how you like to be reassured by me telling you that you the one 
 And how it be mine and how I'm going crazy 
 You got a nigga caught up in it, every time I'm all up in it 
 Loving every minute, all I know is I don't wanna finish 
 And I'mma be talking to you while I hit it when you ask me to 
 (Tia London) 
 Tell me that it's the one 
 Tell me baby it's the one you been waiting for 
 Tell me so I can make sure 
 Tell me baby 'cause you know that it's yours 
 Oh-whoa 
 That it's yours
