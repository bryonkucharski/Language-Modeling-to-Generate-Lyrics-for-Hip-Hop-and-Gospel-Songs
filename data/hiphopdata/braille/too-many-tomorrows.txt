SendingAnnotate this one out 
 Where ever you are 
 And it was just me and her in the car 
 Rode trip to nowhere sleeping under the stars 
 She was buckled in her seat 
 But wanted to be held in my arms 
 I sang her a song and prayed from my heart 
 It was dark in Sacramento 
 Pulled over to the side I was tired and it's been a long ride 
 Nothing else matters after this moment 
 Everything changes It'll never be the same 
 My daughter asks questions 
 Like how can I explain it in a way that makes sense to a little child's brain 
 It isn't child's play this is serious biz, it really is 
 Starting over just me and my kid 
 In one year we lived in eight different houses 
 Slept together on floors and couches 
 But God filled me with faith to move mountains 
 God filled me with faith to move mountains 
 So I don't really worry about tomorrow 
 Tomorrow get worried about me 
 Yeah I know yesterday was crazy 
 Who knows what tomorrow may bring 
 But I don't really worry about tomorrow 
 Tomorrow get worried about me 
 I'm not worried about you 
 You should worry 'bout worry 'bout me 
 Tomorrow 
 You should worry 'bout me I'll be coming for ya 
 And tomorrow ain't nothing I never seen 
 Sorrow ain't something I never felt before 
 I can't predict the future 
 All I know is how I spend today 
 We play a major role but I'm not in control 
 No sense in stressing all the unknowns 
 I'm learning about contentment 
 Things in my life been turning around 
 Once the jury is out the word of mouth starts spreading 
 And then I see the direction I'm headed 
 It's better than if things went the way I expected 
 As long as the Father's will is done I won't be disappointed with the final outcome 
 There's way to many tomorrow's 
 And I'm not afraid of losing it all 
 Whatever I'm going through I know your there and in the end know you're my reward 
 So never worry about tomorrow 
 Because tomorrow will worry about itself 
 Each day has enough trouble of it's own
