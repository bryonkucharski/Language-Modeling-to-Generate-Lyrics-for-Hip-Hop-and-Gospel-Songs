West coast native (4x) 
 I was born 1981 
 September 22, first born son 
 Got my feet wet in the city of rain 
 Learned how to walk in the muddy terrain 
 Used my tape decks to study the rap game 
 Been around for a while 
 Seen a lot of things change 
 This is my native land, language I understand 
 Before I made records, I was a fan 
 I was into east coast mostly 
 The lifesavers were my favorite group locally 
 2000 cream team with the speakers on max 
 And the DJ would scratch with his sneakers on his hands 
 Man, you could find me in the front row 
 With the double X clothes on 
 Pockets full of papers that I wrote on 
 Always had rhymes with me 
 That's why I know how to write them so quickly 
 West coast native (3x) 
 Where was I 
 Lemme pick up where I left off 
 A few years after Hammer pants and Criss Cross 
 I took it serious, notebooks, pencil leads 
 Flow go with the beat like a needle and thread 
 Needle to the record, free styling in my room 
 No audience, letting the bass go boom 
 For the love of it and that's the native lung of it 
 Back then never knew what would become of it 
 Before I had my driver's license 
 I was analyzing who could rhyme the nicest 
 Shy and silent, but something inside was rising 
 Each step got more surprising 
 West coast native (3x) 
 I learned the hard way, nobody taught me how 
 Kept flowing even though I had a sloppy style 
 Didn't know how to count my bars right 
 Must have learned how to play my cards right 
 So many emcees light years ahead of me 
 What can I do that hasn't been done already 
 Not much, I'm a novice in this 
 Made mistakes, I can't go back and fix it 
 I was wicked, never sought forgiveness 
 Never thought I'd write rhymes with the gospel in it 
 I'm not the El Capitan or lieutenant 
 Things never penned how I planned, I admit it 
 Thank God I repented 
 I was so foolish 
 I thought I could get saved by the music 
 Be He chose me 
 It's a lot to take in and that's how the story begins 
 Let's get it in
