Poison 
 You eatin me alive with these lies 
 And I believed the lie before you lied to me 
 The irony that I would be to blind to see 
 Yeah saw it in my diary 
 I knew it all along but I'm human and I'm wrong 
 I just want to control 
 I'm such a liability moved by epiphanies 
 Made up my mind and I refuse to see it differently 
 Prophetic when I said it so the message was embedded 
 But I always make exceptions to the rule I don't regret it 
 Instead of walkin' away with a hard heart 
 Lots of anger lots of frustration rage like danger danger 
 The opposite is true grace compassion and truth 
 After everything that happened bad habits and distractions 
 It's hard to imagine all the coulda woulda shoulda 
 But what would it be to this is not my [?] 
 So I repent for the events that have taken place 
 And I ate enough poison that I recognize the taste 
 In the last four years I shed more tears than I'd like to admit 
 But I also shed my skin that revealed that I'm a serpent 
 I hate snakes crawlin on they bellies 
 Don't tell me that I got that in my character trait 
 I see the scales on my face 
 And I'm fighten it no that's not me 
 It never has been but that's when it kicks me like a ton of bricks 
 Like I deserved the punishment the wrath of God 
 I tried to laugh it off 
 But I can neither stand in judgment or stand in awe 
 For moments when I couldn't stand at all 
 Collapsinin perhaps it was caused from trying to hold it in 
 When something is wrong but you don't know what it is 
 With a blind fold try to pin the tail on a donkey 
 Is it you or is it me? 
 Who's responsible for this? 
 It's impossible to guess 
 So I'm left in unrest for the moments I wept 
 Kept your dirty little secrets 
 Which only made it harder to put together the pieces 
 And know I see it 
 A clear picture 
 That this path was here for me to walk down 
 An instrument used to break me down 
 So I could be broken over my own sin 
 And not be subject to the lie 
 Spoken inward and out would the outcome is out of my hands 
 The thought that my plan could succeed on my own without God 
 What a total facade
