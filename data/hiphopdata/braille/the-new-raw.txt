Vicious on the rhythm leave the beat in a bad position 
 It's gonna need more than stitches when I'm finished with it 
 And that's a clever way to say what my intention is 
 Kill a track with a vengeance and I won't hide the evidence 
 There's no question left 
 I won't second guess the the infinite, the heavens open up for men to enter in 
 His sanctuary in the sky where we worship him 
 I gained access, it ain't come to pass yet 
 We still live in the middle ground 
 They call my style under 
 I slap mics with my upper hand 
 Broken man God's redemption plan gives me hope 
 And that might be the rawest rhyme I ever wrote 
 So raw the blood is still red, ecoli 
 Fee figh of fum a giant on the drum 
 I am [?] when the fire comes light it up brighter 
 And keep it raw until I hear well done 
 R-a-w 
 Raw 
 Braille serving God 
 Until my death 
 My goal is to stay raw 
 Move back I'm a boom-bapitarian 
 So boost the frequency to beats sounds like a feast (beast) 
 Blood in the water for a shark in the aquarium 
 When it comes to the bars I'm a barbarian 
 I ain't no joke homie that's hilarious 
 Spill my guts on the cut, Caesarean style 
 This is bringing out the animal in me 
 React to the track with the animal instinct 
 My body it broke it's hard words till my body hurts 
 Working to the point of exhaustion 
 Working when my stomach is nauseous 
 Still got a lot to accomplish 
 So I keep on rocking regardless 
 My lack of faith is like a slap in my masters face 
 And pleasing God is worth more than anything I chase 
 Gotta persevere through the drama and the nonsense 
 The love of Christ keeps me going through the process 
 Well done is the new raw 
 Let me break it down for y'all no confusion involved 
 No illusions or mirages 
 The movement is large 
 I'm on the grind all day 'cause I'm down for the cause 
 Emcees out there you better stand clear 
 The beats that I'm rocking this year are unfair 
 Excellence is what I strive for 
 The kingdom is what I grind for 
 And you don't stop 
 Ohmega Watts on the beat y'all 
 Well done is the new raw 
 Well done is the new raw
