You feel it... 
 You feel it... 
 You feel it... 
 You feel it like braille 
 You feel it like braille 
 You feel it like braille 
 You feel it like braille 
 (And I can feel it) 
 (And I can feel it) 
 Deep breath as I cross the street 
 What's on the other side right across the street 
 Double crossed, homie had a cross on his necklace 
 Thought I could trust him, cross examination 
 I take back the last statement, boiling point 
 I could feel the lack of patience, planning some habitation 
 Panic and passive hatred go off the top in the battle, get decapitated 
 They don't hurt you on accident, it's all premeditated 
 They had it all planned out (out) 
 I wanna fly away, but I can feel gravity and the depravity of my humanity 
 I feel trapped in a bubble or square 
 Then I complain like the struggle ain't fair (it ain't fair) 
 Cities' destroyed by tsunamis, different forms of despair 
 Like my issues don't compare 
 You feel it like braille 
 You feel it like braille 
 You feel it like braille 
 (And I can feel it) 
 (And I can feel it) 
 You feel it like braille 
 You feel it like braille 
 You feel it like braille 
 (And I can feel it) 
 (And I can feel it) 
 I let the cat out the bag my life was getting hard 
 It's still raining cats and dogs on the boulevard of broken dreams 
 Chasing after light beams (light beams) 
 Staying close to my shadow (shadow) 
 Keep your enemies close 
 Raising my daughter in a broken home (broken home) 
 And when she's not with me, I'm just home alone 
 Might get a few calls on my mobile phone 
 But I keep it on silent when I'm in the zone (ha) 
 I zone out when the beat coming 
 Speak life over death that's why I can't sleep, cousin 
 Face problems like a man can't keep running 
 Blood, sweat and tears, you really wanna bleed from it 
 This is my job, I keep my shirt tucked in 
 But I never punch out, sometimes I punch in 
 I feel the weight of this fallen world, I know you feel it to 
 The Lord is my refuge, redemption and rescue 
 You feel it like braille 
 You feel it like braille 
 You feel it like braille 
 (And I can feel it) 
 (And I can feel it) 
 You feel it like braille 
 You feel it like braille 
 You feel it like braille 
 (And I can feel it) 
 (And I can feel it) 
 You feel it like... 
 You feel it like... 
 You feel it like... 
 You feel it like braille
