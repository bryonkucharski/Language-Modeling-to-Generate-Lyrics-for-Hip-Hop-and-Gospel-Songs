Right this moment, yo we're running out of time 
 We'll see if I get to finish this rhyme 
 Life on earth is cursed, the curtain closes, eyes open 
 Searching for peace in final moments, playing the game till it's over 
 Perfect strangers, perfection isn't obtained by 
 Momentary gain or, voluntary pain 
 Martyr your heart condition, sacrifice all your possessions 
 It's burning up in flames with violent aggression causing depression 
 Right this moment a women gets raped, there's no escape 
 The flesh flashed in his face fed his rage 
 On every tv station and magazine page 
 We keep falling (to temptation) cause this is how we're raised 
 I don't expect every line to make sense at first mention 
 That's why with this album I recommend repeated listens 
 My flow isn't the illest, my content isn't the sickest 
 These visions are to specific, I'm bringing you something different 
 Right this Moment, what's going on? 
 Step outside, turn on your tv, turn on the radio 
 Blaow, coming through your speaker right now 
 Music is more then just a style 
 Right this Moment, what's going on? 
 Step outside, turn on your tv, turn on your radio 
 Blaow, coming through your speaker worldwide 
 To many shades of grey, time to make it black and white 
 Right this moment, another rapper gets shot 
 You'd act surprised, but there's something you forgot 
 We reap what we sew, each lyric is a seed 
 Guns ain't killing rock stars, they only murder mcs 
 Many lives lost, stolen by bullets blasted out chambers 
 A clear and present danger, playing the game till it's over 
 It's all fun and games until someone gets hurt 
 Might just start shooting ourselves like Kurt, (for what it's worth) 
 Right this moment, soldiers invade foreign territory 
 Tear it down and bring terror to their family 
 I can't say if it's wrong or justified, I'm just a man who stands 
 Between behind the scene secrets, so I admit I have a weekness 
 We can sit and argue about, who's right and who's wrong 
 Who's good and who's evil, the discussion goes on and on 
 All I know is, (right this moment) I can make a difference in this world 
 Sit and watch it get worse or work to make it more secure
