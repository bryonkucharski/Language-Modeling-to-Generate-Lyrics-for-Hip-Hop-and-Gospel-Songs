This year, it's all about this year right here 
 This year, it's all about this year right here 
 This year, it's all about this year right here 
 This year, it's all about this year right here 
 My wings are soaring 
 Spent too many years held down by the forces of darkness 
 Exhausted with no energy 
 My box of rhymes filled with many thoughts and memories 
 Unforgiving those that trespass against me 
 My character in life to sacrifice against me 
 No regrets, self relentless on a journey 
 Another year, another opportunity - yeah. 
 A new sunrise, a new day to embrace 
 And make changes in my life, to rest in new stages ??? 
 Restoration for my family 
 We felt the pains of broken-ness, lonliness 
 I'm hopin this year we can grow from the struggle 
 I'm holding this pen and expressing my heart 
 And I gotta show my love with actions 
 To focus on God and not get distracted 
 This year, it's all about this year right here (x4) 
 It's obvious that I'm livin' a dream 
 I try hard to stay awake but it's way too late 
 So long I've waited, so far away 
 No man could take away what I'm holding 
 My salvation, peace, love, and freedom 
 I've got other things but I know I don't need 'em 
 I got my family and that's so beautiful 
 When I write rhymes, each line is crucial 
 I'm inspired by ??? butterfly 
 I'm not lookin' at those girls when they passin by 
 Silly sinacle, you could sit at home 
 That's a essential though I'm not tryin' ta catch next drop kick 
 I got so much on the line 
 I'm feelin' like the paper that I write on, no doubt 
 I'm keepin' God first at being diligent 
 So no matter what I face I can deal wit it 
 Tony Stone on the beat and we're doin' it... 
 (Beat change) 
 This year! It's all about this year right here (x4) 
 Ill flavor in ya ear wit a message! 
 This is the Bay ta test for the main event 
 I speak from the soul, my skintone is irrelevant 
 Canada to Germany, LA to the East 
 I did shows in Japan, I'm a travelin man like MosDef 
 I got ten-thousand of Yen 
 8 bucks, 5 Euro, keep it live in ya borough or project 
 I'm on a mission with ambition 
 Bringin' transmission to spiritual transmission 
 Spread throught the airwaves like a air-raid 
 Droppin' concepts never heard on the airplay 
 And airborne evolution's takin' place 
 It all starts with you, Mic check 1, 2 
 Where you at, huh!?!
