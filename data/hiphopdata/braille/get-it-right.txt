Chorus: 
 How I wonder why I utter 
 Words so ugly, hear me stutter 
 If my mother heard me now 
 She might slap me, save me now 
 I'm a mad man in a dark room 
 Playing the piano, it's my heart's tune 
 And I want you so bad 
 I said I want you so bad 
 You're no good, I'm no good either, you showed me the dark side, I followed the leader, losing my patience, try to gain composure, I can see the storm coming like my name's Noah, can't say I didn't warn you, who warned us? What are we supposed to do when the storm's us? Where are we supposed to run to? What can I say? I don't even know who I'm talking to, looking in the mirror I see unfamiliar shadows, looking in the galaxy I feel so shallow, my heart, like a black hole, wicked and deceitful, trying to do good, surrounded by evil 
 This time I will get it right, now's the time for me to step into the light 
 (repeat) 
 The light is so beautiful, I close my eyes, 
 I've been burned before, it happened many times, 
 I can be my own worst enemy or I can blame You for tempting me, I got good and bad tendencies, tenacious and habitual, with bad habits and rituals, worthy of ridicule, I got no excuses, I'm pitiful, I get stressed over miniscule little nothings, just a drop in the bucket, I see a way out but I'm so reluctant, it's time to swallow my pride, it's time to get my life right 
 All these thoughts, they drive me crazy 
 Some of them are now escaping 
 There's a spider in my head 
 And I'm afraid to go to bed 
 I'm a mad man and I've lost it 
 Won't You please help me find it? 
 Cause I need You so bad 
 Oh yes I need You so bad, You're so good 
 Your mercy is so good 
 Your blood, it covers me 
 It sounds a little dark 
 I'm walking in the light
