Yeah, we be rolling on your block with the west coast 
 You know, something crazy like this 
 I gotta look at ?? for a second 
 It's just so hard, west coast style 
 Submission hold 
 We break the mold 
 You can't hold us down 
 The truth hurts, my frequencies leave bruises, play this in your Cadillac or PT Cruisers, I'm doing it, hard to the core, from the heart, and when I spark a rhyme it's sort of hard to ignore, I know you're loving it when Braille brings the ruggedness, more sick then throwing up in a cup and chugging it, the poor and rich fight with swords and fists, I got my torch lit walking through the dark abyss, the struggle is hard, so we hustle and plot, try to find easy money then your bubble gets popped, it's like we got minimal options, friends turn criminal often, street heroes lost and forgotten, that's when we hit rock bottom, this place is not Sodom or Gomorrah, but living here is torture, when you're trapped in submission, and try to get freedom from the world system, it's non-existent 
 I'm holding it down for my fam and friends, spread around food for thought until the famine ends, some assume I was born with a silver spoon, it's not true, I just do what I gotta do to push through, self-employed and self-motivated, but I won't give the glory to myself for how far I made it, or what I overcome, lyrics flow from my lungs and I spit them over drums, living in America like J.B., R.I.P., and I'm knocking out the enemy like this is Rocky IV, after Ivan Drago killed Apollo Creed, with no apology so now it's all on me, and I don't battle with the flesh and blood, but when it comes to my own flesh and blood, don't press your luck, I let God settle the score on behalf of me, turn the other cheek and submit to His majesty 
 Ride with me 
 Fly with me 
 Rock with me
