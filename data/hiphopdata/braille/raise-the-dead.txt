?? 
 Move forward, they lock us up, we lock it up, and ?? give us the ?? to keep going. Let's go 
 Raise the dead spirits 
 How can we raise the dead when 
 They've been gone so long, Please 
 Bring them back to life 
 Is it possible to do that? 
 Zombies in the streets 
 Their needs have been ignored 
 Screaming can't you hear this? 
 Raise the dead spirits 
 In the destitute land 
 We cry for revolution but don't execute the plan 
 Our people get executed instead 
 The land of the living dead 
 Pop shots aimed at their head 
 Lost ones, young sons who got guns, they pull it out 
 Make them shout when trouble comes 
 Nobody knows where he got it from 
 But when it blows he's got us on the run 
 The block is scared, living in fear 
 Total paranoia, he takes steroids and the boy is a destroyer 
 Bullets fly, inflicting his first victim 
 He said he would kill a second in a millisecond 
 Red and blue lights flashing 
 Cops harassing potential assassins 
 Mamas cry 
 These kids don't listen well 
 One in the grave and one in the prison cell 
 I'm speakin' on those that we walk with talk with live with 
 Those we relate to even just a little bit 
 Mischievous misfits cops and killers 
 Every man woman and child that has been delivered 
 It's not God but made in his image 
 In the strive for perfection we all lose our pilgrimage 
 Humble in slum villages peace war and famine 
 Keep the young dumb and build up more smart cannons 
 Soft porn and hard landings 
 Found dead with this ?? 
 Picked him up from a stray bullet 
 Here a gang bangers standing 
 Hand in your resignation 
 Lives cut short from violence stds or disease 
 Beef and pork 
 Worked for a living and forget to live 
 Save every nickel and dime but never give 
 Die to live live to die 
 Every life that you led 
 Lived to see another day
