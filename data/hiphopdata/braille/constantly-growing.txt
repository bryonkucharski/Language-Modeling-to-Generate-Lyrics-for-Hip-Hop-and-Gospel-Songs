Constantly growing 
 We constantly grow 
 The people we know 
 Mind body and soul 
 Good and evil grow 
 We reap what we sow 
 Grow or die 
 The dichotomy a cacophony of mediocrity 
 Monotony gets pawned off ?? 
 Frontin on your fans 
 Common yo honestly 
 Why you even bother B? 
 You better off being who you oughta be 
 So part of me 
 As I outgrow this pottery 
 Roots run deep 
 Down where the water be 
 This honesty brings out the God in me 
 I'm placed in his garden 
 Right where I gotta be 
 The rain gives me food 
 It's sun gives me light 
 But, the only reason I grow the Son gave me life 
 The tent that we live in is for rent, not owned 
 It withers away then one day it's gone 
 But inside we thrive, we advance, we sprout 
 We constantly grow, our souls abound 
 What up my people? 
 We break it down to the soil 
 It all started with a seed, and that includes me 
 Every thought, every action 
 Every tree bearing fruit, everything that we see 
 Growing simultaneously with spontaneity 
 Celebrated moments and forgotten memories leaving a legacy 
 Negative and positive, good and evil, wrong and right 
 Perfect vision and lost eyesight 
 We see it in hindsight after we fall behind 
 Learning from mistakes as our heart gets refined 
 The design of mankind 
 Clay in the Creator's hand, connected to the vine 
 Understand who made the man before the man made mandates 
 The man-maker had a plan greater to save us from the sin nature 
 Grim reaper, we dig deeper than physical features 
 Individual students and teachers 
 The garden of our hearts, reaping a harvest from what was planted 
 Sowing seeds and taking chances 
 No time for standing still, life moves on 
 The cycle continues, the greatest change of your life will happen within you 
 In a greenhouse 
 Getting grown organically 
 Sun precipitation soil no genetic tampering hampering my growth 
 It's a metaphor for the ceaseless process we all me before our death 
 Life happens whether or not there were made plans 
 Memories hold hands with experiences on the sands that time buried 
 So carry on to the next phase 
 We the past like the last ?? on next days dawn 
 It brings along a host of situations 
 To aid in vegetation it's destiny chasing 
 Quicken the pace so I can catch the trip 
 I'm at the winds of change 
 It's all natural mechanics (it's plain why it feels strange?)
