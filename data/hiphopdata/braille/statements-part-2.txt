So hello hello, we came to rock your dome 
 I got my man by my side so I'm never alone 
 Return to Sender on hiatus, but the fruit still grows 
 Lightheaded worldwide, see you at the next show 
 So knock knock, we came to rock your dome 
 I got my man by my side so I'm never alone 
 Return to Sender on hiatus but the fruit still grows 
 Lightheaded worldwide, see you at the next show 
 Ay yo, I cipher within, endless chapters of information 
 Put rappers in their place like assigned seating arrangements 
 Saving for the future, never wasting my wage on instant 
 Gratification, the ramifications will manifest themselves in (due time) 
 The moon shines when the sun doesn't 
 Problems come, you either solve them or run from it 
 I've done both, humbled to make honest statements 
 To stay rooted in the truth and stop making excuses 
 Wounds soon to heal, stay tuned for the update 
 Of progress, reporting from Portland never conforming 
 To confusion, that clouds our vision like winter breeze 
 Love doesn't cost a thing but we can't sin for free 
 Consequences roam the premises, ready to strike 
 I rock steady in strife, and not shaken by the night (fall) 
 For all y'all in the place, Lightheaded running the race 
 And I will say it like I mean it till I'm red in the face 
 So hello hello, we came to rock your dome 
 I got my man by my side so I'm never alone 
 Return to Sender on hiatus but the fruit still grows 
 Lightheaded worldwide, see you at the next show 
 So knock knock, we came to rock your dome 
 I got my man by my side so I'm never alone 
 Return to Sender on hiatus, but the fruit still grows 
 Lightheaded worldwide, see you at the next show 
 Cohesive connection, a fleet of rhymes feeding off divine 
 Intervention, inventing styles that will free your mind 
 Boggling, heads bobbing abiding to the rhythm 
 Provision given from Tony Stone, Return to Sender spitting 
 Splitting atoms and still, haven't released Needles in the Hay 
 So check the Pure Thoughts and future projects on display 
 For all the listeners, what a combination 
 We fellowship on MICs with life giving statement
