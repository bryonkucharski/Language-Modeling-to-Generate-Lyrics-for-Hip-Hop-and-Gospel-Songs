I give myself, is that enough for you? 
 I will give myself to you 
 She got a face like a porcelain doll, and her big brown eyes make me feel so small 
 Porcelain dolls are so fragile, she breaks when she falls 
 But I will catch you, that's what I promise 
 She got a smile that could light up the room, the smell of her perfume got me high as the moon 
 The way she moves entices, but stay away 
 I'm convinced I could kill a man like Cyprus 
 And she knows that I would die for her, but that wouldn't save her soul so I live 
 Give myself, I know I'm not Jesus, but I wanna love her like he does 
 This is free love, it only works two ways 
 You can accept what I offer or throw it back in my face 
 And I take this woman to be, but I don't wanna take from her, I wanna give myself 
 And all that I have, to have and to hold, for as long as I live 
 I give myself all that I have, to have and to hold, for as long as I live, I give 
 I give myself, is that enough for you? 
 I will give myself to you 
 She looks good even when she don't try, everyone tells her but she doesn't know why 
 I said Girl, if you lived in the sky, I would buy a telescope just to look in your eyes 
 She laughed a lil bit and she brushed it off, brushin her hair it's so black and soft 
 She said her hair is just like her heart, It might look strong but its fallin' apart 
 And she knows that I got love for her, I spend my life making sure I'm the one for her 
 She was with me on almost every van or bus, you're not a fan of me, you're a fan of us 
 The man I've become, husband and daddy, I wanna make these two beautiful girls happy 
 I wish that I could offer the world but all I got is these words and a promise to give myself 
 And all that I have, to have and to hold, for as long as I live 
 I give myself all that I have, to have and to hold, for as long as I live, I give 
 I give myself, is that enough for you? 
 I will give myself to you 
 She got a face like a porcelain doll, and her big brown eyes make me feel so small 
 She got a smile that could light up the room, the smell of her perfume got me high, high... 
 And she knows that I would die for her, but that wouldn't save her soul so I give myself 
 And all that I have, to have and to hold, for as long as I live 
 I give myself all that I have, to have and to hold, for as long as I live, I give 
 I give myself, is that enough for you? 
 I will give myself to you
