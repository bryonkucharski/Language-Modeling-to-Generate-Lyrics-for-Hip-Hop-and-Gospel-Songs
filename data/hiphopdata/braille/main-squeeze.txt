Everything's gonna be all right 
 Ask Alicia, my girl is a queen like Latifah 
 Nice to meet ya, I'm not a creeper 
 So if I dance in your radius I'm not trying to freak ya 
 I don't live single, I mingle with the ring on 
 Tied the knot in 02' until infinity beyond 
 I'm light years ahead of you player, I don't play games 
 I won't take back my words like it's my last name 
 Innocent until proven, word to Chief Wiggum 
 Call my raps Sugar Smacks and all y'all Dig Em' 
 The track gets composed on the MP 
 Nobody seeing this, who's on the boards, check the fingerprints 
 88 keys drop the 808 bass, 'cause it's 2008 and I got something to say 
 Hey rappers, hey judgment day, bad news 
 Are you my main squeeze? 
 I wanna squeeze you 
 I wanna hold you tight 
 That's what I want to do 
 I'm not a drinking man, I'm more like a thinking man 
 I think out loud they say, "Boy watch your mouth!" 
 Yo man if you got something to say, let it out 
 Don't hold your breath, it's like hey 
 The world should know this and also take notice that 
 I'm not afraid to get on stage and share emotions 
 The more I put in it the harder I rock 
 And the harder I rock the harder they jock 
 Radio disk jockeys on their high horses 
 Whipping the listeners, keep running the same track 
 The playlist is more like a paylist 
 But my songs are on from DJs who only play favorites
