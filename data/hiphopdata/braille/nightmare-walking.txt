She go butterfly eyes but I call them bat wings 
 She bat them things and trap you in the shackling 
 You want to get in the sack with her 
 She put you in the body bag pull up the zipper 
 You say and that's my Boo get her named tattooed 
 Girl will put you through a nightmare you should call her your BOO 
 Run away like [?] them spider legs ain't cute the itsy bitsy spider climbing up your spinal cord 
 Paralyze you when the venom enters your veins 
 Check her in at the clinic 'cause she mentally insane 
 Get yourself checked incase any venom remains 
 Once it sinks in deep you can never remove this pain 
 Your heart gets entangled with her [?] 
 You were walking with a target on your back 
 She on the attack like a marksmen 
 This mistress never misses 
 You'll be swimming with the fishes if she get's you on her hit list 
 Strictly risky business a sticky predicament 
 Tricky isn't it she get you into thinking she was into it 
 This sickening make your stomach turn when you picture it 
 Lies coming from her lips 
 Looking like red liquorish 
 It might sound sorta shocking 
 It's not a foreign topic 
 For some the erotic is like a narcotic 
 Acting erratic the siren song is so hypnotic 
 You get lost want it at all costs 
 With her fishnet stockings she a fisher of men 
 But that's not what the parable meant 
 It's terrible fell in the trap with the temptress 
 You couldn't find a catch you got caught it's the opposite 
 Honey on the lips make the lies sweet 
 Smells like she's dead but her perfume hides it 
 She got butterfly knives 
 Carves her name on your wrist 
 You get captured by the ball and chain 
 No ring but you sing when she calls you 
 And her personal life don't involve you 
 With all due respect I'll tell you a dark secret 
 Two become one, so you are who you sleep with 
 Horror stories, there's a reason to be mortified 
 When two [?] of the lamb join hands God is glorified 
 But if you always in bad relationships look in the mirror 
 And tell me who the nightmare is 
 Nightmare walking 
 You're a nightmare
