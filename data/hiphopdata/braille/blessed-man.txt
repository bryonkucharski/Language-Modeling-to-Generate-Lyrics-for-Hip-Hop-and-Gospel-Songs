I feel so blessed y'all 
 This track is incredible 
 S one 
 You can feel it 
 I'm a blessed man 
 Yes man, I'm a blessed man 
 Right now, I'm a blessed man 
 No question, I'm a blessed man 
 You can feel it, so much joy 
 It's like a dream come true 
 A sneak preview of the grand finale 
 I get a taste of heaven, it's like milk and honey 
 I was blessed with love before I had money 
 The things I love most, you can't take from me 
 I hold them close, the Most High and my family 
 I might never get fortune and fame 
 I'm always gonna say I've been a fortunate man 
 And when they ask who I am, I will stand up and say I'm a blessed man 
 And when they ask where I'm at, it doesn't matter, I'm with you, I'm a blessed man 
 And when they ask why, I will point to the sky, I'm a blessed man 
 Yeah, yes man I'm a blessed man 
 Yes man I'm a blessed man 
 We walked through the park holding hands 
 And I'm thinking to myself I'm a blessed man 
 You're so beautiful the words escape me 
 Like the day I watched you give birth to our baby 
 You illuminate when I'm in a dark place 
 Bless my heart with a smile on your face 
 I'ma say it, my wife is hot 
 So it don't matter how much ice I got 
 I put a ring on her finger, leave it at that 
 If it wasn't for her I wouldn't be where I'm at 
 If it wasn't for God maybe we never would have met 
 But He brought us together so there's no question we're blessed 
 I don't write many love songs, I'm sorry girl 
 The truth is I never hear beats worthy of it 
 But when the glove fits I let the world know 
 I'm married to an angel and plan to stay faithful 
 As I sit back reflecting 
 It's obvious that my life's been protected 
 I had friends get murdered 
 I could have been there 
 Friends committed suicide 
 I could have went there 
 Depression, my life could have ended 
 I could have took a flight on September 11th 
 Life is fragile, we take it for granted 
 I'm thankful for the life I was handed 
 Christ stretched out His arms on the cross 
 Offered me freedom at a tremendous cost 
 I can't accept the gift without repentance 
 I talk to God with expectancy 
 He said "Ask for anything in the name of My Son 
 If it's My will then it will be done" 
 I'm not praying for material possessions 
 Being close to God is the greatest blessing
