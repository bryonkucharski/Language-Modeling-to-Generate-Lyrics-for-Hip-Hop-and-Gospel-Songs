I have to be deliberate when I deliver this 
 The words are on the tip of my tongue 
 Lips quivering 
 It's not cold outside but my body is shivering 
 And the skin that I'm in is shaken deep to the core 
 I'm pacing the floor like I have a nervous habit 
 And I'm an anxious person but that's not the reason why 
 It hurts to be a husband, seeing your wife cry 
 Concerned for her emotions while I'm tripping over mine 
 Holding my baby during the first day of her life 
 Doctors come into the room saying something isn't right 
 They couldn't tell us why 
 So they started running tests at the ICU with wires connected to her head 
 The imagery was intense, we just kept on praying 
 Trying to stay calm, but in my mind it was mayhem 
 We faced it as a family 
 Never alone 
 And I was smiling when we got to bring our baby girl home 
 If I could tell you all my stories 
 Then you would realize in yours it's not over 
 I've been through so many battles 
 And I almost lost myself, but now I'm back 
 Now I'm back again 
 I was in Portland writing this song 
 Then I got a call that something was wrong 
 It never crossed my mind that you might be gone 
 Cause you were so young and your will was so strong 
 On my way to the hospital 
 I was driving slow 
 Didn't really think it was your time to go 
 When I arrived, I was calm, asking what happened 
 They said after the cat scan I can chat with the chaplain 
 And he's telling me you had a major stroke 
 A vessel in your brain stem suddenly broke 
 Took me to your bed, now it's just me and you 
 Father and son in the emergency room 
 I said a few words 
 You couldn't even speak 
 The only reason you're breathing is from a machine 
 I'm always gonna miss you, but God gave me peace 
 Letting go of regrets, holding on to the memories 
 If I could tell you all of my stories 
 I'm sure you have many of your own
