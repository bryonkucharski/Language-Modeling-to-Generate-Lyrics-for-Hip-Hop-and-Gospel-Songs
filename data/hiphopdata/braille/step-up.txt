My daughter growing up fast I need to step it up 
 The industry on the crash I need to step it up 
 These days might be our last I need to step it up 
 You dig? 
 Step it up now 
 I got to step it up now 
 I remember summer time 
 Aqua socks at the swimming pool 
 Singing silly songs on the sunny afternoon 
 Chasing after bubbles from the bubble wand 
 Right now it feels like all our troubles are gone 
 It's just me and my Yo Gabby gabba 
 Sippy cup sipper tippy toe tapper and her daddy is a rapper 
 So she knows my moves 
 She can stand on one leg like I do 
 And say yo yo yo like I do 
 When I'm looking at the baby pictures 
 How could I drop her off at the baby sitter man I'd rather be with her 
 I can't go for that I'm on my Hall and Oates tip 
 She was nodding her head to the beat when I wrote this 
 I want to guide her with compassion and wise words 
 And never criticize her 
 Offer her correction when she whines and complains 
 But also take time to explain 
 Train up my child to the best of my ability 
 Wisdom from God is what I really need 
 So humility is natural 
 I've been humiliated 
 But God wasn't ashamed to be affiliated with me 
 He even initiated 
 And that's love I got to step it up 
 I got to step it up that's love 
 I got to step it up 
 You know girl if I step to you I'll show you my A game 
 But I want my A game to be my every day game 
 I'm not one to play games 
 I shoot straight aim high 
 Suitcase stay fly 
 Still wear my backpack act my age 
 No I'm not a daddy mac 
 More like a daddy making mac and cheese 
 Up in the kitchen 
 I cook it right for my Bugga Boo 
 Just called to say hello girl I hope I'm not bugging you 
 I don't know what to do I want to take it slow 
 They say when you meet the right one you just know 
 I got nothing to hide so don't hide from me 
 Don't play hide and seek don't be misleading 
 If I need you miss from sunrise to evening 
 We can bump heads without lying and a cheating 
 You're a princess because the king adopted you 
 If that wasn't the case I wouldn't rock with you 
 But since it's so I'll sow into this miss that's why I'm so into this miss 
 Get it? 
 Since it's so I'll sow into this miss that's why I'm so into this miss 
 Get it?
