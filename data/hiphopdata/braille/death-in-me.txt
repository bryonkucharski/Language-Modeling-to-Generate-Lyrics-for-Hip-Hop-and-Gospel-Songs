Witness the death of me in 16 bars 
 Walk through the doors of Skid Row and you'll see dark 
 It sounded good to it bump like some canker sores 
 In the streets I was blazing corn 
 You could say I had faith no more 
 Below average never rested on the black Sabbath 
 Served white zombies like white snakes we act savage 
 Inside me was a quiet riot dressed in living color 
 Searching for nirvana I promise I'm like the sickest brother 
 Needed a cure from the one who was made of veil 
 You know the lamb of God that took three nine inch nails 
 Died for me my sisters sister my motley crew 
 Rose from a sepultura his disciples saw the truth 
 No Cinderella story all glory to him 
 Losing the slipknot that we made toying with sin 
 Saved us from a mega death hell malice and pain 
 Without his sacrifice that's blindness, Alice in chains 
 Heathen 
 (Verse 2: Braille) 
 I try to live righteous, it's like I can't achieve it 
 The sin inside of me is the worst of all diseases 
 30 below freezing, broken and missing pieces 
 I'm becoming whole and it's only because of Jesus 
 Y'all knew what I was saying before I said it 
 Raw and authentic 
 This is how he altered my genetics 
 The curse came from Adam I inherited death 
 So I'm a nightmare walking when I'm wearing my flesh 
 It's definite the deficit will be the death of us 
 All sin hated equally there is no prejudice 
 Medicine for the sick confess your infection 
 And get cleansed by the blood 
 Of the lamb true perfection is him 
 And him alone on the throne 
 The risen king received the wrath that was due for me 
 I'm saved and set free by the cross 
 Bloody massacre the maximum punishment possible 
 It's not a popular topic I'm talking about the gospel y'all 
 (Verse 3: Odd Thomas) 
 The death in me is the resurrection in me 
 It's the testament of god's perfection invested in me 
 But the root of sin inside of me keeps on lying to me 
 And has me dying to my spirit subtly shackling me 
 Downed and broke but not as bad as I could possible be 
 Honestly depravity affects the core of humanity 
 But the fact remains 
 I'm still blemished and stained 
 Scarred and left with pain 
 With really only myself to blame 
 So welcome to my funeral fit with an open casket 
 For y'all to see the drastic ecclesiastic tactics 
 On behalf of Christ crucified on the cross 
 That calls the right position, wager my sin lost 
 So while you're sorta trying to sort it out 
 Holding your breath 
 Nothing left getting closer to death in a short amount 
 My advice is to trust in Christ with the broken parts of the heart 
 And experience life soon after the death starts 
 I saw the death in me
