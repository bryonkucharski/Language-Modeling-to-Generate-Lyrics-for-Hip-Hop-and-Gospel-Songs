Ay yo, I cipher in the center of this life cycle 
 It's a rhyme recital written for your safety and survival 
 It's vital information for a dying generation 
 My text respiration for the earths restoration 
 And edification, soul crusade, I tour the states 
 Eight years rhyming, still improving with age 
 Making musical wages, moving crowds in all locations 
 On stages and radio stations, got love for all creation 
 Rocking the nation I'm patient, motivated to make it 
 The David vs. Goliath scenario, blasted through your stereo 
 From every angle and topic, deposit knowledge 
 Wisdom and logic cautiously, kicking it constantly 
 A clear conscience and a strategy for the process 
 Put thoughts in action with active ingredients, actively feeding this 
 Vision all that it needs, raising havoc 
 Even when I wreck it here's a method to my madness 
 Braille Brizzy I'm back, I connect with the 
 Track, attack and react with raw rap 
 Cipher in the center of wherever I'm at 
 When the beat drops it's on, I let loose and blast 
 Braille Brizzy I'm back, I connect with the 
 Track, attack and react with raw rap 
 Cipher in the center of wherever I'm at 
 When the beat drops, it's on, I let loose and blast
