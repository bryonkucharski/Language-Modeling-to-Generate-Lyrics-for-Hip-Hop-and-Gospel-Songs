Simple message is so clear it's complex 
 I'm [?] this dimension 
 I'm extra equipped during the evil invasion 
 Complexicated 
 I speak candidly and don't max nothing 
 Lay my cards on the table 
 Way past bluffin 
 No poker face 
 Treat me like a joker 
 But I'm over the debate 
 I know I'm holding an ace 
 Flame thrower trying to gas my head 
 I stay sober pavin the way with no [?] 
 Fame is a lame motive 
 I aim to remain ultra 
 Beyond the status quota 
 Padded envelopes with my pen and pad quotes 
 'Cause I been bad since your favorite album covers had [?] 
 Gold chains for you dull frame 
 I'm in the zone through my own thang full swang 
 Heavy hitter always ready to deliver 
 And I bring my girl with me if we get a babysitter 
 That's a complexicated situation right there, yes sir 
 Every word I serve is so pertinent 
 Sounds real deep with some pain and some hurt in it 
 I got time to kill this is how I murder it 
 All your enthusiasm I'm curbin it 
 That sounds worldly when I put some earth in it 
 But please don't curse the gift 
 Cause the gift is making room for me, yeah 
 Blessed man but I'm not a blind one 
 A worthy challenger no I couldn't find one 
 For God for me 
 Plenty up to par 
 But how you gonna battle Bill Gates with pennies in a jar 
 I Got the word in my heart 
 But my memory is scared 
 Spirit is willing but surrendering is hard 
 Trying to fight this war won't get me too far 
 'Cause I'm not even sure who my enemies are 
 I see vultures in the sky 'cause I smell like death 
 But I got abundant life his mercy is fresh 
 I wonder around on this forsaken land 
 Where truth is hard to find like a faithful man 
 I guess I got big shoes to fill 
 Never abuse the power of my musical skill 
 If the needles don't hit you then Cupid will 
 Givin' up is stupid putrid and ill 
 The male ego is frail and feeble 
 I pale in comparison to him, Braille's evil 
 Are you surprised that I'm flawed like David and Paul 
 With thorns in my flesh and all 
 I went through hard times like "poor me" 
 But I survived to tell this story 
 To God be the glory 
 Perseverance produces character
