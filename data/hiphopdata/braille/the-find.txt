Ohmega watts mega mix, butter milk biscuits for your boombox 
 Old school like tube socks 
 Smooth like a butterfly, sting like a scorpion 
 How you throwing rocks when your house made of porcelain? 
 503 origin, originate original 
 Compositions analog or digital, underground or pinnacle heights 
 We reach, writing rhymes on skylines and shine heavenly 
 Heavy rotation with fly melodies, 
 Flipped fresh, dipped in honey but never sugar coated 
 Sound-scape's change shape but our hearts stay devoted 
 Wax, reformation, Watts, shock electric 
 Much, time invested into musical progression 
 To bring you, the final result laced correct 
 Reflecting a new state of soul that lives inside effectively 
 Translated through music to your mind 
 An everlasting understanding that we found, it's the find 
 I rock and bring revolution as the record rotates 
 Earthquake mental states when I drop like nuclear waste 
 Shaking the industry, breaking the mold 
 A broken jaw won't stop this, speaking truth hard to handle like chop sticks 
 Ha, spitting fire till the place evacuates 
 Saturate my shirt with sweat stains and ashes, we smash it 
 Spiritually everlasting, with uncanny passion 
 Mastering microphones like focus over distraction 
 Setting the tone, bring medicine in a sick flow 
 Rappers biting their tongue like French kissing with a Pit-bull 
 I'm your host, Braille Brizzy, rocking the beat 
 It's the find, need I say more, I'll let the music speak
