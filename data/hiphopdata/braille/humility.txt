If I fall and lose it all let my pride be defeated, 
 The cure to my weakness, 
 Every man has a dark secret, 
 It eats away at our heart where we keep it, 
 I can feel victory rising up as I speak this, 
 Confessing my sins, they all get deleted, 
 Decorate my life with humility and uniqueness, 
 I got to let you go now, you're no longer welcome, 
 At times we get selfish and stubborn, Lord help us, 
 Wash away my bitterness, forgive and deliver me, 
 I'm lost in the wilderness, wondering aimlessly, 
 I can't blame the government for the pain I see, 
 So instead of complaing I rather help those in need, 
 Listen to the wise and submit to authority, 
 It's part of my testimony, I can't compromise it, 
 Trying to stay humble and living life like Christ did, 
 Count it all joy when I'm making sacrifices, 
 I'm trying to find, that place of humility, 
 Deep down inside, 
 I don't want to lose what I have, 
 We all want everything, 
 I'm tring to reach, that place of humility, 
 Deep down inside, 
 I'm trying to do the best that I can, 
 And be thankful for what I have. 
 I wrote so much now, I'm running out of words, 
 Trying to emotions into literary terms, 
 As I juggle my responsibilities and opportunities, 
 I'm not a teenager no more, I'm twenty four, 
 I've walked through a lot of doors and face many more, 
 Trying to learn from the mistakes I already made before, 
 I understand that no man is perfect and complete, 
 I also now that God is strong when I am weak, 
 So I stand on my feet, through victory and defeat, 
 How I made it this far is a mystery to me, 
 Every time I write it's like my history repeats, 
 Searching this life for humility and peace. 
 Yesterday is gone, I miss it so much, 
 I'll never forget you, its hard to move on, 
 Today slips away, he was so young, 
 His time was cut short, rest in peace my man, 
 And now we celebrate the birth of tomorrow, 
 New smiles form and replace all the sorrow, 
 I hold on to the memories you left me, 
 Pass them to the young so they know their history, 
 Making an effort to every moment, 
 It seems the end approaches before we ever notice, 
 I won't take you for granted while your here, 
 I know we're not promised tomorrow again, 
 I got a child on the way, the joy of my world, 
 As I write this I don't know if you're a boy or a girl, 
 It seems the future is sneaking up on me, 
 I'm not afraid, I just pray for humility.
