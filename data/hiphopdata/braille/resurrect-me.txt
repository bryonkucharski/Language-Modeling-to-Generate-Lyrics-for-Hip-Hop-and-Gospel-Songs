Never imagined myself walking in these shoes 
 The road I was on was littered with many clues 
 I didn't recognize the signs 
 I couldn't read them 
 It was a foreign language 
 So if you were speaking 
 I heard the sound 
 But couldn't interpret the signal 
 'Cause my ears were not trained 
 To understand the pitfalls that many talked of 
 I thought I understood 
 But I was undermining my understanding 
 Crash landing 
 Barely standing 
 Chaos overrules and overthrows careful planning 
 So much demanding all of me 
 Every day all I see is someone or something that needs me 
 But I got needs too 
 It's funny 'cause I don't even know what they are 
 But when I find them I'll probably keep searching for more 
 Instead of being thankful for what's provided 
 So resurrect me 
 Oh won't you resurrect me 
 'Cause I think I'm dead 
 And if not I'm dying 
 Bring me back to life 
 So resurrect me 
 Oh won't you resurrect me 
 'Cause I think I'm dead 
 And if not I'm dying 
 Bring me back to life 
 The passion that burned is gone 
 The laughing just hasn't happened it's all gone 
 If you ever looked at me and thought I was strong 
 Sorry to say you were wrong 
 What went wrong? I don't know 
 I try to trace back every step I took 
 I look for your smile but it's somber 
 I look in the mirror and I'm conquered 
 Do you concur that this is obscure? 
 That a perfectly painted picture is now just a blur 
 My inside gets stirred 
 I was so innocent 
 Never knew how bad this life could hurt 
 And that's why I live like a bird 
 But now I just live like a burden 
 I was driven by faith and purpose 
 Now I hitchhike 'cause I'm afraid to make a wrong turn 
 So resurrect me 
 Oh won't you resurrect me 
 'Cause I think I'm dead 
 And if not I'm dying 
 Bring me back to life 
 So resurrect me 
 Oh won't you resurrect me 
 'Cause I think I'm dead 
 And if not I'm dying 
 Bring me back to life 
 Bring me back to life 
 Resurrect me 
 Bring me back to life 
 Resurrect me 
 'Cause I think I'm dead 
 And if not I'm dying 
 'Cause I think I'm dead 
 And if not I'm dying
