Count the cost, I'm gonna make this life count, before I'm down for the count 
 Count the cost, we're gonna make this life count, before we're down for the count 
 We, struggle and fight, through the dark of night 
 And the sharks that bite will give you scars for life 
 See the stars and stripes, we salute 
 A never ending pursuit of truth it's true 
 The permanent we're after, persevere when disaster strikes 
 Shining light when we're smashing, smashing MICs 
 And stay focused on the after, after life 
 'Cause if it won't last it's not worth the price 
 It's all live, dead alive, stage dive, resurrect for recreation 
 Re-create, re-structure, set the record strait for restoration 
 Constant temptation, I'm set apart and separated 
 Every step we take, elevates us towards the final destination 
 Determined and certain the words in the sermon are serving a purpose 
 Lifting the burdens, if your searching I'm sure it's worth it 
 To seek the surgeon, defeat the serpents and circumstances 
 That lurk below the surface waiting for a chance to murk us 
 Infectious infections, the tongue is a lethal weapon 
 That can either destroy you or bring protection 
 Who's the enemy? Who's injecting our seeds with greedy eyes 
 And feeding minds sugar coated poison, disguised as vitamins 
 Vital signs of the times are evident, most are hesitant 
 To realize, the seven headed dragon spitting fire speaking lies 
 But I will rise, receive the spiritual prize 
 And not waste my life chasing temporary highs 
 We, struggle and fight, through the dark of night 
 And the sharks that bite will give you scars for life 
 See the stars and stripes, we salute 
 A never ending pursuit of truth it's true 
 The permanent we're after, persevere when disaster strikes 
 Shining light when we're smashing, smashing MICs 
 And stay focused on the after, after life 
 'Cause if it won't last it's not worth the price 
 Count the cost, I'm gonna make this life count, before I'm down for the count 
 Count the cost, we're gonna make this life count, before we're down for the count
