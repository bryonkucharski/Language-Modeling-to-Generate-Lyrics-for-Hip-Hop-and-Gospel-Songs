Soul Rock Rock, Rock your Soul 
 Soul Rock Rock, Rock your Soul, let me hear you say 
 Soul Rock Rock, Rock your Soul 
 Soul Rock Rock, Rock your Soul 
 The Soul Rock soldier, rock solid sonic Solomon 
 Rock in Sodom and Gomorah, souls tortured, sin abolishes 
 Society, the beats and rhymes bring the balance back 
 I swing a battle axe, attack accurate, lyrical tactics 
 Take flight over the badlands, bad habits reign supreme 
 Battered and bruised, confused with shattered dreams 
 It's time to change the scene, full swing, drums harder to hit ya 
 Get a ticket for the show, your missing the big picture 
 Dis-figured images, deception dominates the premises 
 It's war, but who's the enemy? Who's the nemesis? 
 Pessimistic perceptions spread spiritual pestilence 
 (Soul rock) not just to entertain but also for your soul's benefit
