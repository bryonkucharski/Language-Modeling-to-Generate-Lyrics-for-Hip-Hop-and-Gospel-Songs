9-1-1 wasn't a joke 
 Pistols blaze, young guns get lost in the smoke 
 There's a war going on between the rich and the broke 
 It's in the streets, worldwide, overseas and under oath 
 From day one man was flawed, we fall daily 
 No man is perfect, word, but we can keep working 
 Fulfill our purpose, before we're gone with the wind 
 Storing treasures for the final days and focus on the end (result) 
 The vinyl plays and I write, my minds stays in the light 
 And sprays a rhyme to ignite freedom 
 I'm feeling like it's all over 
 Standing in the cold to be reminded that I'm still breathing 
 And I'm leaving this state of mind that got me depressed 
 All the desires of the flesh, get put to rest 
 And understand, we can live free in harsh reality 
 And shine light, when it's to dark to see 
 Keep on, sun rise to sun fall 
 Get your back up off the wall and keep 
 Keep on, we in this together, good and bad weather 
 Only the soul lasts forever 
 Keep on, sun rise to sun fall 
 Get your back up off the wall and keep 
 Keep on, focus on the permanent things 
 We can't always trust what we see 
 I'm taking shots at the system like a paparazzi 
 You can't stop me, from operating properly 
 I'm set to prosper with no illegal scandal, 
 Just honest, diligent hard work, I can't stand still 
 I call my cash cream, it's not about the benjamin's 
 My cream is medicine, I'm not afraid to spread it thin 
 Bless a struggling family with some food to eat 
 I know if in reverse, they would do it for me 
 I'm looking out for my people in these trife (trifle) times 
 Children play outside and put their life on the line 
 It's not all bad, but it's been seeming so lately 
 Seeing all these teenage girls raising babies 
 With no fathers, subliminal manslaughter 
 Young bucks on the block sipping dirty bath water 
 In glass bottles, feeling betrayed and cursed 
 Stay encouraged, the last shall be first, I'm saying 
 Keep on, sun rise to sun fall 
 Get your back up off the wall and keep 
 Keep on, we in this together, good and bad weather 
 Only the soul lasts forever 
 Keep on, sun rise to sun fall 
 Get your back up off the wall and keep 
 Keep on, focus on the permanent things 
 We can't always trust what we see 
 Goliath strikes and stands larger then my shadow is 
 I'm not equipt to battle this man handler alone 
 Built on the rock, evil infiltrates my home 
 And I'm to honest to God to cast the first stone 
 Fear factor got me thinking to turn, run the opposite way 
 Options fade, opposition tossing grenades 
 I'm not trained in the art of war 
 I'm not running wild chasing beef, like a carnivore 
 Sometimes I feel like giving up 
 Sometimes I feel like it's not worth the fight 
 Sometimes I feel like nobody cares 
 Cried at night and realized, God was right there 
 So regardless of what's see with physical eyes 
 (Deep inside) I know there's meaning to life 
 And even when I'm feeling down, defiled, defeated and dry 
 I can still lift my hands to the sky (keep on)
