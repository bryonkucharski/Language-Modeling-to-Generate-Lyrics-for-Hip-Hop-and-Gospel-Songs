Poetry in motion bodies moving to the message 
 My presentation perfected, progressing your perception 
 Uh, spin the record, recognize we wreck it, no question 
 Repping (representing) refreshing essence of hiphop in every session 
 When I, step on stage, verbal weapons blaze 
 Full throttle with a bottle of water, spitting flames 
 This industry is lacking, longevity, I'm long lasting 
 Classic craftsmen, create tracks with passion 
 Tony Stone makes heads nod, I make 'em meditate 
 Elevate and demonstrate the next level when I accelerate 
 The fluid flow, Pure Thoughts, Underexposed 
 Lifefirst: half the battle, it's been a Long Road 
 Yo I turn crews, into endangered species 
 Make em, back off the MIC like it's covered in feces 
 Awww yeah, Brizzy swing on the track 
 One time, doing it right, it's like that 
 Poetry in Motion bodies moving to the message 
 My presentation perfected, Brizzy blessing the session 
 Old school, future and present, I bring preservation 
 Handling the pressure, pressed for time but I'm patient 
 Back aching, from holding the weight, maintaining 
 Weather walking in the rain or waiting at the train station 
 No matter the location, I'm giving my best 
 One hundred percent, I'm never settling for less 
 Got that raw type of style, get all over the track, yeah 
 Blast automatically with verbal attack 
 When I drop and blow spots, a powerful impact 
 Setting the tone with no error in my Syntax 
 Day by (day) Daily Operation, respect is Hard to Earn 
 I enter the arena screaming, you must learn 
 I emerge from the phone booth, super MC 
 Poetry in motion move your body to the beat, come on 
 It goes One Two, I'm checking microphones like messages 
 Messing with heads when I spit, rhymes wrecking it 
 You can't see this, I'm the Proptosis specialist 
 Your rocking with the excellent, late night medicine 
 Shock heads like Edison, every line is relevant 
 X-ray vision to expose your skeleton 
 Life sentences, my style sparking drama 
 Got you sweating the technique like I'm rocking in a sauna 
 I'm a Microphone Fiend, grip it tight till my palms hurt 
 And Move the Crowd like I relocated my concert 
 Calm your nerves (catch your breath) Relax with Pep 
 I flow six days a week, on the seventh I rest 
 Battle seven headed dragons, feed the fire with dialogs 
 And sever their necks using the old rugged cross 
 I'm down for the cause, keep it moving like a nomad 
 Never leave home without the pen and the pad 
 Poetry in motion like graffiti on trains 
 I tag my name on your heart and things will never be the same... after this
