I can't fight with my fists, I bring spiritual knowledge 
 I'm not hardcore, but my foundation is rock solid 
 We're in critical times, criminal minds packing pistols and nines 
 Blasting, speaking lies to the masses, UH 
 I rush microphones with multiple motives, compulsive doses 
 Of potent truth spoken explosive 
 High voltage frequencies broadcasted 
 I'd rather starve to death then feed the beast, yeah, I'd rather take action 
 Sick of seeing my people suffer while the poison gets blasted 
 Through the solar system, (with wisdom) I'm fixing universal damage 
 It's chaos, we're in a state of global panic 
 It's safer in outer-space then it is in our local planet 
 I'm planting seeds for the future, on a daily basis 
 My crew stands out from the rest like we had alien faces 
 From a, hidden location, or live in your area 
 Text for the blind, letting my little light shine 
 Ya ya ya you, can feel it in your mind and soul 
 Ya ya ya you, can feel it in your body and bones 
 Ya ya ya you, can feel it all over the globe 
 When we, Rush, the microphone 
 We're gonna rush, rush, rush, rush the microphone 
 Braille from Lightheaded rush the microphone
