Oh Lord I give my life to you 
 I trust in you my God 
 Do not let me be disgraced 
 Or let my enemies rejoice in my defeat 
 No one who trusts in you will ever be disgraced 
 But disgrace comes to those who try to deceive others 
 Show me the righ path oh Lord 
 Point out the road for me to follow 
 Lead me by your truth and teach me 
 For you are the God who saves me 
 All day long I put my hope in you 
 Remember oh Lord you compassion and unfailing love 
 Which you have shown from long ages past 
 Do not remember the rebellious sins of my youth 
 Remember me in light of your unfaling love 
 For you are mercifull oh Lord 
 I get frustrated that these scares from my past still cause me to hold back 
 Cover my shame with a blanket of faith so I don't waste my life 
 It seems so easy to fall off track 
 Help me to believe that you are who you say hold me back when I lose my way 
 I walk a lonely trail sometimes it feels like it's you and me only, the Lord is my witness 
 Sober minded they offer dranks thanks a lot 
 If I did drink, last year I woulda drank a lot 
 And mighta never stoped it runs in my family 
 It got the best of my grandpa, uncle, and pops 
 Shake it off, shallow advice 
 But it takes more to conquere a vice that grips so tight 
 When I'm low help me remember and put my hope in Christ 
 And when our minds get filled with lies 
 We will remember 
 The [?] get's pulled over our eyes 
 We will remember 
 Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide 
 We will remember 
 The enemy tries to steal our lives 
 But, we will remember 
 Close my eyes act like it never happened 
 Take my chances like my life is just an accident 
 Ignore the sorrow 
 Like the feeling is it real 
 But never learn how to deal with the emotions I conceal 
 Let it out 
 Ups and downs 
 Character producing 
 This stress that I carry is ulcer inducing 
 And ultra confusing 
 Which way is up 
 Love doesn't sweep issues under the rug 
 It faces the reality 
 They say forgive and forget 
 Let go don't live to regrets 
 But someone's always left with a mess 
 How can we erase memories from our head 
 Where will they escape to 
 How will I forget when I'm reminded everyday 
 Every day every morning when I wake up 
 I'm gonna need grace just to make it 
 Your grace is the blanket 
 That covers all my sins and mistakes up 
 Help me remember
