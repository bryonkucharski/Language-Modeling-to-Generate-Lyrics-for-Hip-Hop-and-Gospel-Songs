Children struggle to find someone to listen, that's why 
 All they have is the music that they listen to 
 Meet the world, it's trife (trifle) and frost bitten 
 Our generations youth wander around like lost kittens 
 Dodging stray bullets and advertise bulletins 
 Fatal attractions, placed to pull you in 
 The media is feeding us with poison 
 People eat it up like it's valuable when really it destroys them 
 Society is blind with so many distractions 
 There's only one God but we're chasing after fractions 
 And fiction, full speed with no cause or mission 
 That's why, most live a life of contradiction 
 And words like love have lost their definition 
 The best way to make a statement is through actions 
 I'm through acting, I can't control how it goes 
 I take it one step at a time, walking this long road 
 I, Keep, Wondering 
 Where, Will I Be 
 I, Keep, Wondering 
 Where, Will I Be 
 I would like to let you know that you 
 Can't predict what might go down next 
 Life goes in many directions and sometimes 
 It takes us by surprise 
 I've been caught off guard by many challenges and challengers 
 That arrived un-announced, unexpected 
 I was once a young child filled with innocence 
 Who I am now after many instances and experience? 
 How many times did my dreams change? 
 How many times did my mind change? 
 Ten years ago I was in seventh grade with no worries 
 But now I got plenty bills to pay 
 You know how it go when you got no dough 
 And the bills stack up while the interest rate grows 
 It's like the more that you save up, the more that you owe 
 And sometimes we do the same thing with our soul 
 I, Keep, Wondering 
 Where, Will I Be 
 I, Keep, Wondering 
 Where, Will I Be 
 Looking back ten years ago 
 I didn't know I was walking this road 
 Now that I'm on it, if I'm honest 
 I'm not sure that I want it 
 Sometimes my mind goes back and forth 
 Trying to figure out, what I'm working towards 
 Who am I working for? gotta do this right 
 The patterns I set now will follow me through life
