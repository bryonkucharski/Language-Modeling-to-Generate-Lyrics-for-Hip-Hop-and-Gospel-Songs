Sick of the thought of all the battles that I fought 
 Tangled up intestines and my stomach's in a knot 
 When will I learn my lesson wrestilin' with flesh and blood 
 I've fallen so far behind it's like I'm never catching up 
 Ambition in my belly so I take a bigger bite than I can chew 
 But now it's to late to spit out my food 
 Swallow my pride take the bitter pill 
 When I feel hypercritical and hypocritical combined 
 A bad combination 
 Birds of a feather weight afraid of heights 
 So they never elevate or fly 
 The fear of failure 
 Make you scared to even try 
 Cause you so selfaware that your're not quite there 
 I learned the hard way like it was a Broadway 
 Show went broad daylight and everybody saw 
 They probably talking right now I hear voices in the background 
 When I turn the track down down 
 Every scar in my repertoire 
 Is a reminder for my weakness leading me back to Jesus 
 Oh how I need his mercy and grace always 
 We all fall short and I learned that the hardway 
 That the lesson that I learned 
 It don't have to be that way 
 You better work it out 
 I learned the hard way 
 Look, sharing life's ills while the ink spills 
 From the independent will 
 Where do I begin 
 My hands take a walk 
 They talk with my skin 
 Feel the scars from all of them hard lessons of my sin 
 Put it in laymens 
 I thought my game plan was better than the one of who's image I was made in 
 Making my own choices 
 Instead of heading his voice 
 Kid, I went and mixed a cup of that poison 
 Scotch felt so good till the morning 
 But was only scotch taped till what an earth quake had broken 
 Pain outweighed what I gained in enjoyment 
 Dang, and I cold have a-voided it 
 But, you gonna suffer no matter what lane you choose to take 
 The pain it changed or the pain it just staying the same 
 So while you wrestle with the choice 
 Thank good cause only one leads to joy 
 I love the father tell he's good boy not to put his hand on the pot 'cause he know the joint hot 
 And we get all burned up he just don't want us burned up 
 But, sometimes it takes a good hour to get learned up
