Trained for this moment since the day I was born 
 Since before I made tapes that ignored 
 Since before I had a rap name or started to record 
 I've been chilling in the back getting prepared for war 
 I got a strategy, this isn't random rapid fire 
 This is one shot, headed for Goliath (I can't miss) 
 Target practice on topics, flipping rhymes off the top 
 Waiting for this one chance to throw my rock (rock on) 
 The least expected to defeat the beast 
 Judgements passed to blast my confidence, I won't surrender or retreat 
 Return my gifts to the sender, this is worship in the chaos 
 This is heavy concentration (got my game face on) 
 An eruption of noise flooding from a mouth of silence 
 I'm nobody, a spec of dust battling a giant 
 He stands and mocks me, everyone things I'm crazy 
 Laughing as if I'm not aware of who I'm facing 
 Goliath, I sat back and watched for to long 
 You can't hold me down anymore 
 Goliath, it's been going on for to long 
 I'm sick and tired, now I'm taking out the giant 
 Goliath, I sat back and watched for to long 
 You can't hold us down anymore 
 Goliath, it's been going on for to long 
 I'm sick and tired, now I'm taking out the giant 
 And his shadow covers the country side, we're dwelling in the darkness 
 Running away, while he's running things 
 Calling shots, got us locked in bondage 
 His threats hold us hostage, afraid to be free from his grip 
 I can't hold my tongue, I'm holding this stone 
 Hands sweaty and callus, mentally un-balanced, I'm ready for the challenge 
 Seen many before me back down and crack under pressure 
 It's time to take drastic measure, let it loose 
 Intimidation factor tries to set in, I'm grab my weapon 
 Not arrogant, but it's apparent that he's feeling threatened 
 I'm stepping in his direction, the point of no return 
 With every action backed by the power of words 
 Goliath, I sat back and watched for to long 
 You can't hold me down anymore 
 Goliath, it's been going on for to long 
 I'm sick and tired, now I'm taking out the giant 
 Goliath, I sat back and watched for to long 
 You can't hold us down anymore 
 Goliath, it's been going on for to long 
 I'm sick and tired, now I'm taking out the giant 
 My armor is weak, I don't expect to be hit at all 
 I'm entering, knowing I'm protected (he can't touch me) 
 Mental simulations, got me picturing victory 
 He's snickering and slithering, I'm setting him strait 
 Full speed ahead, he's surprised by my approach 
 Probably thinking I'ma try and swing a sword to his throat 
 But I go for what I know, throw a stone with precision 
 Accurate and cracking his skull, when it hits it 
 He's tripping, he's shaking, I'm taking him out 
 And before he could react he fell flat on the ground 
 The whole earth shook, I returned to finish him 
 Chopped of his head and carried it through the villages 
 The city people cheered, I delivered a speech 
 They all danced in the streets celebrating his defeat 
 I said, he was dead, before the battle started 
 To take him out you just gotta aim for the right target
