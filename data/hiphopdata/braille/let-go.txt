Letting go, of something that you hold close 
 Why you let it stay around, you just don't know, say 
 Let it Go 
 Let it Go 
 Letting go, of something that you hold close 
 Tried to make it work out, but it won't, say 
 Let it Go 
 Let it Go 
 I gotta let this go, once and for all, I'm one voice 
 Speaking in-between the pauses, waiting for my time 
 Is it right now or has it passed me by, I magnify 
 The situation through my glass eye and analyze it 
 What's real and what's fake? It's blown out of proportion 
 All the voices in my head sound distorted (do the right thing) 
 And muffled, I'm stretching my faith muscle, this rap game's a hustle 
 A struggle to stay humble and trust 
 Big trouble, in little me, causing complications 
 I run from confrontation, observations made from a distance 
 My defense to resist, I'm not convinced 
 That all my silhouettes can co-exist, so I drift 
 Into the clouds of God's grace and freedom, feeling like these feelings 
 Is filling me, with pride and negativity I don't need 
 And even though at times I felt stepped on 
 And taken for granted, it's time to heal from the damage 
 Letting go, of something that you hold close 
 Why you let it stay around, you just don't know, say 
 Let it Go 
 Let it Go 
 Letting go, of something that you hold close 
 Tried to make it work out, but it won't, say 
 Let it Go 
 Let it Go
