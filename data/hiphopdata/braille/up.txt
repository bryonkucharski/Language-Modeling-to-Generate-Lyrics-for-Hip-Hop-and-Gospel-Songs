You can't filter the filthiness it's fillin every crevasse 
 Hard to the core and it's oozin out the edges 
 Balance with no boundaries perfectly symmetric 
 If you [?] you get your head flipped, effective 
 Reap what you sow change the whole perspective 
 Disrespect 'em get surprised if you get disrespected 
 Natural law like when gravity falls 
 But my humanity is not controlled by the those animal instincts discipline displayed 
 At my disposal are weapons that can blow you 
 But I'd rather get to know you show you the way 
 Out of orbit I forfeit my power take yours and absorb it 
 I could leave you in torture and torment 
 Or free you from your distorted self portrait 
 Mixed emotions fixated on fiction 
 Reality burns more than it bites fight the addiction 
 Fantasy land price of admission is everything 
 Enter at your own risk when the dark abyss promises bliss 
 Listen close the serpent always talks with a hiss 
 You could get this 
 When you walk down slowly 
 It doesn't get lower than this 
 The only way left to go is 
 After rock bottom I'm taken off in a rocket 
 I'm tired of the topic so drop it 
 I got this toxic venom ready to inflict on the victim 
 There's enough room for all of us know your place in the system 
 When planets collide the damage is dynamic 
 It's a shame when your potential dies from bad habits 
 I ride sound waves across time and space 
 You could see the sunshine but be blind to the rays that illuminate 
 The human status so temporal but the absolute truth is unpenetrable 
 I put my armor on fend from the fiery darts 
 You could get lost following stars or if you follow your heart 
 Deception is deaths best friend 
 Return from the depths of a dead end 
 I'm dead set on elevation stand in my position 
 And no man can come and sway my commitment
