 Yeah, you can say whatever you want 
 Yo, congratulations on album number four 
 Now say something like this Hey this is dad 
 Hey Brian this is dad 
 Start it like this son 
 Listen to the drums 
 I get down like this on a platter of wax 
 Manufacture my heart and that's a matter of fact 
 My grammar and mannerisms, confuse man's wisdom 
 For the humans in oppression, I'm here to stand with them 
 Vision for the cataract, counterattack 
 Fall down, I bounce back, holla, I holla back 
 Start it like this son, they can't shine like this one 
 Lyrics in my head and I'm about to spit some 
 Mission impossible, I'm missing my father now 
 He passed away, I could have said "Why even bother now?" 
 Lose my integrity, let the music get watered down 
 You know my steez, you know the foundation of the sound 
 I'm working harder than ever on this endeavor 
 He died from high blood pressure, I don't got a vendetta 
 I dedicate this to the process of life or death 
 Walking through the valley of the shadows, taking righteous steps 
 West coast native, listening to Native Tongues 
 I stay away from drugs and I don't play with guns 
 I keep it safe like I stole a base 
 The Ricky Henderson, learned a lesson from the greats 
 I wanna make it to the hall of fame without an asterisk 
 Leave behind a legacy for generations after this 
 I saw the news and heard about the tragedies 
 Traveled the world and saw beautiful humanity 
 Different cultures and nationalities 
 I love the variety, you be you and I'll be me 
 We need more U-N-I-T why 
 Does racism still exist, stop walking blindly 
 We need more mercy and more forgiveness 
 I don't just talk this, I live this 
 You can visit the west side and witness 
 You can turn on my album and listen 
 Now
