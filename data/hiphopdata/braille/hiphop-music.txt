I don't bust caps or press 'em on Krylon cans 
 I just stand on stage with the MIC in my hand 
 8 years ago, no friend of mine 
 Was around to talk, so I'd sit and write rhymes 
 I can't say, hiphop is all bad cause it isn't 
 Sometimes it makes me mad and I eject it from my system 
 This is an art-form, a form of expression 
 Communication, something that youth relate with 
 Gang related or peace statements, it's all up to the artist 
 We got, freedom of speech and each aims for a different target 
 Different markets, different agendas, different intentions 
 Some are pure, some are offensive 
 I'm just, one of many different sides represented 
 Or should I mention, each individual is their own extension 
 Speaking their perspective, so in this game I hold my own 
 Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my home 
 Hiphop started in the Bronx, come on 
 Now it lives all over the world 
 People of all types embrace the culture, bang the music 
 Get into it, start a movement, keep doing it 
 When you write your first rhyme don't expect to be 
 Considered the best MC, develop your flavor and recipe 
 If you wanna see success it takes a lot of sacrifice and effort 
 Just because you got a flow doesn't get you cheddar 
 Call it cash money, I hate slang and stereo types 
 For all mediums I give the same advice 
 No matter what you strive for, no matter what goals you got 
 There's no short cut to the golden pot, the plot thickens 
 I spit out lyrics like their lukewarm but keep it hot 
 Plant seeds to feed the flock when the beat knocks 
 Stay focused on God, bless tracks with passion 
 I'll be loving hiphop till my flesh turns to ashes 
 I got a love/hate relationship with hiphop, it frustrates me 
 It can break these rusty chains or drive me crazy 
 I'm a rhyme spitting, time bomb ticking 
 Christ is living, and died, to save me from this worlds sickness 
 When people think of rap music they relate it to players, pimps 
 Paper chasers and gang bangers, but don't forget 
 Just cause you see them scenes in videos 
 Doesn't mean, that for every MC, that's how it really goes 
 The truth is, hiphop is diverse as earth is 
 What a man speaks reflects the world he's immersed in 
 And the condition of his heart, yo it's hard to judge it 
 Most these rappers would be nothing, without their budget 
 And record labels, paying for promotions 
 Putting their face on posters, while they posing 
 But see, hiphop music gave a voice to the streets 
 Plus it made profit, so now everybody wants a piece 
 I wasn't down from the beginning but since I started 
 I've been true to God, myself and true to the art 
 All I got left to say for everybody east to west 
 Represent hiphop right if you want it to get respect
