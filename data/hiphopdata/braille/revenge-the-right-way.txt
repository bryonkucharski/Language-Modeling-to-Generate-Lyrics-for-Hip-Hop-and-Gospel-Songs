We gonna have to handle this 
 Channel this energy 
 The damage has already been done 
 It's time to get revenge the right way 
 Don't get me wrong when I make this song 
 I'm just a messenger for inter ventilation from my chimney with this fire 
 I'm spittin' if I pop 'em in the mouth 
 Pop the trunk and throw the body in 
 Or get my posse involved 
 Kamikaze and the obvious reaction they expect from me 
 Just let it be 
 I keep 'em guessing and they ain't got telepathy 
 'Cause I turn the other cheek It's not a weakness 
 It takes a bigger man to put together all the pieces 
 My choices will affect my daughter nephews and nieces 
 I don't wanna infect 'em with any of my diseases 
 So ceasefire chill we got children in the mix 
 So I can't go aping wild out like gorillas in the mist 
 Rebuild until my life gets better than before 
 Connected to the resurrector let him settle the score on my behalf 
 So I can bring destruction and wrath 
 But is it worth getting sidetracked off the right path? 
 I feel vibrant how do you survive it 
 When they start wilding out and get violent 
 But I've been on this path my father has taught me that 
 Characters revealed on the field and how you react 
 I feel like real life [?] do 
 So I press on even when it don't feel right 
 Been laughed at stabbed in the back 
 Spit on talked about didn't know until after the fact 
 And I ain't trying to get even stevens 
 Let 'em stone them 
 Saw the heavens open up and felt the Lord 
 Hold 'em console em 
 I can't condone em 
 They are not understanding me I can't control em 
 So I let go of my insanity 
 You had me out of obligation 
 I remember walking home from road to station 
 Cause you kicked me out of our place and 
 Spitting on my face and carry on your case and 
 Lying to the lawyers 'bout the truth so you can save face and 
 Put that fear in me so I wouldn't be complacent 
 Used to dream about your death and your funeral arrangements 
 I'm the first born you made all your mistakes with 
 Beat me as a child as man I am patient 
 I heard abuse can be contagious 
 But I left that in my past like slaves under racists 
 It's crazy cause even though we still see him 
 It's easy to forgive when you know you got freedom 
 It could taste so sweet or it could taste so bitter 
 Don't hold the pain in get healed and deliver 
 That's revenge the right way 
 Get revenge the right way
