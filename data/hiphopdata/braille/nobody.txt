Oh oh oh, Nobody make noise 
 Nobody raise your hands to the sky 
 Oh oh oh, Nobody reach out 
 Nobody touch it, what you gonna do 
 Oh oh oh, Nobody make noise 
 Nobody raise your hands to the sky 
 Oh oh oh, Nobody reach out 
 Nobody touch it, what you gonna do 
 Daily double trouble all around, he got a bubble goose 
 When they shoot, he ducks down 
 Avoiding the forces destroying the fruits of his seed 
 Employed by the streets he was working for free 
 Motivated by greed, green sacks he would smoke up 
 And sell to common folk who like toking (smoking) it, on the reg (regular) 
 Ay yo, shots fly he pray one, reach his head 
 Blood pours he caught on in the leg, now 
 Where he run to, crippled, simple minded 
 Lived in the city and, dreamed of dying 
 Promoted death, with every single breath 
 But now his breath is getting short and he's scared 
 Shaking in his boots as he pulls out his hair 
 Got what he wanted but he wasn't prepared 
 Crying, realizing he don't wanna die 
 He's nobody, and me and him are so much alike 
 Oh oh oh, Nobody make noise 
 Nobody raise your hands to the sky 
 Oh oh oh, Nobody reach out 
 Nobody touch it, what you gonna do 
 Oh oh oh, Nobody make noise 
 Nobody raise your hands to the sky 
 Oh oh oh, Nobody reach out 
 Nobody touch it, what you gonna do 
 When the rain falls down, nobody seeks 
 Shelter for the storm, or strength for the weak 
 Nobody wants peace from the violent wind 
 Nobody wants to escape this, life of sin 
 When children cry, nobody wants to help 
 Nobodies true to others, nobodies true to self 
 Nobody shares their wealth, mentally and physically 
 Spiritually and so forth with, faith in God 
 Nobody wants to live, nobody wants to fight 
 Nobody chooses sides standing for what's right 
 Nobody sees color beyond black and white 
 Nobody shines so even the blind can see the light 
 Nobodies leaving behind all the pain from the past 
 God's willing to help, nobodies willing to ask 
 God's willing to help, nobodies willing to ask 
 If only nobody would take off the mask 
 Oh oh oh, Nobody make noise 
 Nobody raise your hands to the sky 
 Oh oh oh, Nobody reach out 
 Nobody touch it, what you gonna do 
 Oh oh oh, Nobody make noise 
 Nobody raise your hands to the sky 
 Oh oh oh, just call me Nobody yeah 
 And I'll be ready when they say that Nobody will do it 
 When the rain falls down, Nobody (I, me or you) seeks 
 Shelter for the storm and strength for the weak 
 Nobody (I) wants peace from the violent wind 
 Nobody wants to escape this, life of sin 
 When children cry, Nobody wants to help 
 Nobody is true to others, Nobody is true to self 
 Nobody shares their wealth, mentally and physically 
 Spiritually and so forth with faith in God 
 Nobody wants to live, nobody wants to fight 
 Nobody chooses sides standing for what's right 
 Nobody sees color beyond black and white 
 Nobody shines so even the blind can see the light 
 Nobody is leaving behind all the pain from the past 
 God's willing to help, Nobody is willing to ask 
 God's willing to help, Nobody is willing to ask 
 Nobody just take off that mask 
 Oh oh oh, Nobody make noise 
 Nobody raise your hands to the sky 
 Oh oh oh, Nobody reach out 
 Nobody touch it, what you gonna do 
 Oh oh oh, Nobody make noise 
 Nobody raise your hands to the sky 
 Oh oh oh, Nobody reach out 
 Nobody touch it, what you gonna do 
 Uh, it goes daily I wrestle 
 See me on stage but I'm nobody special 
 Just call me Nobody yeah 
 And I'll be ready when they say that Nobody will do it 
 Uh, it goes, daily I wrestle 
 See me on stage but I'm nobody special 
 Respond if you feel it 
 A generation of Nobodies waiting to be revealed
