Remember hip hop? 
 Do you really? 
 How could I forget? 
 Remember, one two 
 Keep it simple, I try to do that 
 But when I keep it simple it sounds like something's lacking 
 So I go back and listen to the track and do a few subtractions 
 Grab my pad and pen, write a new line, add it in, hmmmmm 
 I can't say that again, I already rhymed this word with that word 
 So this time I gotta find a new way to flip it 
 Is it that serious? I don't know 
 But I'm not trying to kick a bunch of freestyle flows 
 I'm trying to grow as an artist 
 Charisma and swagger, catch you off guard, I don't look like a rapper 
 Take my picture, I'm not trying to look hard 
 I never been behind bars or tagged train yards 
 With a marker or spray can in hand 
 I'm an emcee y'all, I am who I am 
 To whom it may concern 
 Remember back in the day 
 ?? 
 I'm doing way back 
 This goes out to anybody 
 Lets give back 
 Microphone check, one two, what is this 
 It's friends vs. business and friends come first 
 I never thought this music would be lucrative 
 I didn't know if I was stupid or intuitive 
 Crazy, a little bit but maybe he's brilliant 
 Drawing the blueprint to build this as a little kid 
 When I was fifteen hip hop was a dream 
 Nobody voted for me to be the prom king or class president 
 I was a west coast resident 
 Moved to the east, hip hop was more prevalent 
 Living in New Jersey my junior year 
 High school drop-out, my future's unclear 
 Timberland boots yo, I couldn't play ball 
 I was at the record store, never catch me at the mall 
 Saving lunch money to buy fresh cassettes 
 That's why I stayed hungry to make the next step 
 No more nonsense, I'm taking rappers hostage 
 Sit them in seminars, teach them how to prosper 
 Throw away money on cars and jewelry 
 Whips and chains, that's appropriate slang 
 We become slaves to the idiosyncrasies 
 Of rap songs that they play on the radio frequencies 
 We all desire a higher position 
 Selfish ambition, it's a critical condition 
 You're not giving yourself a chance 
 Like jumping out a plane wearing parachute pants 
 It's all the right words with the wrong emphasis 
 Ignorance attacks, we become our own nemesis 
 I tell it how it is, remember how it was? 
 When I started rapping I did it for the love 
 No matter where you're from, wherever you're at 
 And wherever you go, yo, remember your path
