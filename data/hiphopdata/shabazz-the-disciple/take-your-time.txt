(Shabazz The Disciple) 
 Impressive times, everybody lives the fast life 
 Running around, selling drugs, living trife 
 In order to survive, we have to strive 
 For perfection and have a direction to guide 
 The young ones, out of the darkness of reality 
 It's rap standing for this mic brutality 
 'Cause if we don't got them, where will they end up 
 In a situation where they get sent up 
 For selling drugs or possession of weapons 
 Forcing and sending their own mankind back to the essence 
 Bust shots at the cops for props 
 Low down shots, run the spots 
 So, I'm damn near every block 
 Making it hard to live at your residence 
 Brothers who kill brothers for past experience 
 Let me break it down to my point of view 
 Designed for a white man who didn't die for you 
 I know money is the roots of all evil 
 And worst is the devil, it controls people 
 It has your mind in a state, so negative 
 That to get more, you'll even murder your relatives 
 The drug game took a lot of my brothers 
 And others, but all I could do was think about their mothers 
 They can't bear that thought that their son was shot dead 
 In the ghetto, on the ground with holes in his head 
 All those years of chastizing, advising 
 He really wasn't realizing and open his eyes 
 And looking at life as a meaningfull experience 
 And take the dreams a lot more serious 
 Stop pleading for the opposite race 
 Taking life for a waste and chase in space 
 The latter of success is what we have to climb 
 With the strong mind and yo, take your time 
 (Chorus: "sample", Shabazz The Disciple) 
 "Take your time, young man" 
 Take your time, all you gotta do is just take your time 
 "Don't you rush to get old" 
 "Take your time, young man" 
 Eh, yo, take your time 
 "Don't you rush to get old" 
 (Shabazz The Disciple) 
 Sometiems, I just sit back and wonder 
 What can I do to keep myself from going under 
 In the ghetto, yo, it's hard to stay alive 
 So I keep a strong mind and strive to survive 
 Seems hard at times, but I guess I slipped 
 'Cause I'm here and my mind is equipped 
 I walk past the brothers that be dealing 
 And a negative eye appears glady appealing 
 They drive fancy cars tinted up with a kit 
 How many brothers did they kill to get it 
 They rule the streets on a temporary basis 
 And everyday they live life at fast paces 
 And in the end they go out and fight caucasians 
 Peep smiles on the white man's faces 
 You sell drugs, brother, I don't have to 
 I'd rather make fly beats I could rap to 
 Red Hook is infested with capsules 
 But that's one lifestyle I can't adapt to 
 Because the living is lame, who's to blame 
 It's damn shame, but after you're illusion to maintain 
 And entertain, so use your brain 
 Stop walking all around as if your brain has been drained 
 Stop rushing to get to the top 
 'Cause you might get shot or knocked by the cops 
 Then you'll be sitting in the cell everyday 
 Reminiscing about your life and how you could've got away 
 The only way that you could've escaped 
 Is if you wouldn't have got yourself involved in the first place 
 But it's too damn late to think backwards 
 Think about the sentance you're about to get slapped with 
 So, young brothers, here's a reason to think 
 About how the positive rise and the negative stink 
 They'll become memories of the past 
 The main reason's 'cause they're living their lives too fast 
 The latter of success is what we have to climb 
 So, orcastrate line and yo, take your time 
 (Chorus: "sample", Shabazz The Disciple) 
 "Take your time, young man" 
 Take your time, all you gotta do is just take your time 
 "Don't you rush to get old" 
 "Take your time, young man" 
 Just take your time 
 "Don't you rush to get old" 
 (Shabazz The Disciple) 
 As the world revolves, our people dissolve 
 Create more problems not getting solved 
 We struggle just to survive 
 We struggle to stay alive 
 Innocent are dead, our freedom is deprived 
 Kinifes in fear, yo, we all under stand this 
 Freedom, not death, yo, all must amend this 
 Your minds were diluted, heavily polluted 
 As far as I'm concerned, we've all been excluded 
 Took of our knowledge, but I'm here to speak it 
 Your must love it, before you must seek it 
 Destroy devilish snakes and never be a rebel 
 Instead of all of us falling victim to the devil 
 Don't let them hold you, don't let them control you 
 Don't let no one in the negative state of mind own you 
 Don't fall for the tricks of the 666 
 'Cause they first specialized in the crucifix 
 Now is the time to strive and be wise 
 Where we reach the horizon and we all disguising 
 It's up to us to keep the strong mind 
 So that the light can shine on all mankind 
 Take surprise and in your grands, young man 
 But hwatever you have to do, take your time 
 Listen up boy and take your time 
 (Chorus: "sample", Shabazz The Disciple) 
 "Take your time, young man" 
 "Don't you rush to get old" 
 "Take your time, young man" 
 Eh, yo, take your time 
 "Don't you rush to get old" 
 "Take your time, young man" 
 "Don't you rush to get old"
