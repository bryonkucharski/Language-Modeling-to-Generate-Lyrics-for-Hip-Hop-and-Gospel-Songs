(Chorus - repeat 2X) 
 Bear witness! as I exorcise my exorcism 
 Casting out these devils living in this ghetto prison 
 With heavy metal and ammunition, conditions are unbearable 
 You're listening to street parables! 
 (Verse One: Shabazz) 
 In 97 a.d., due to economy we living 22 deuteronomy 
 Submitting to robbery buddha and sodomy 
 Playing a game of street poker with a royal flush 
 A heart of lust, smoke inhalation from the burning bush 
 Ghetto jerusalem, the streets paved with gold 
 But what profit a man if he shall lose his own soul 
 Hustling with jewelry like solomon 
 In the crystal city 
 Eluding the angel on the pale horse with hell following 
 Sipping wine from a golden cup that runneth over 
 Inscribing ghetto scriptures, inspired by jehovah 
 Yay though I walk through the valley sober 
 Bearing witness to the 7 plagues, standing in the pit of cobras 
 Many disciples in my brigade who prayed, laid with jade 
 The harlots womb bares a plague 
 Isaiah 3:16's, drowning in the heroin river 
 Judas a hitman for 30 pieces of silver 
 The ghetto's the bible for the people of the spirit 
 Interpret the parables, he who has ears let him hear it 
 The ghetto's the bible for the people of the spirit 
 Interpret the parables, he who has ears let him hear it 
 (Verse Two: Lord Jamar) 
 Forever valid being hunted by pontius pilate 
 Confronted by the romans, when I'm blunted I see bad omens 
 Gifts contained within a trojan horse 
 We following a chosen coarse 
 Colossians 1:17, belief in one you never seen 
 I be the true and living supreme, trapped in this prison of fiends 
 What's written in the book of philippines 
 Prophesied by ibrahim 
 Black g-zus of nazarine, get ready for the second coming 
 Caesar's issuing a summons for my arrest 
 Convict me of a lesser charge, and sit me in the devil's nest 
 Persecution of the gods, we never rest 
 A never ending battle 
 Against the pagans, who idolize the golden cattle 
 We've been forsaken with lies, but now we making some strides 
 Way past ecclesiastes, me and the god shabazz be 
 In the lab g, building on math scientifically 
 Watching them die in their iniquity 
 (Verse Three: Shabazz) 
 I get high off the most high, give masses a contact 
 Smoke herbs in bible paper, keep the cap on ya cognac 
 I sip a fifth of juice and genesis, smoke a spliff of exodus 
 Then sniff a kilo of leviticus 
 Running a spot of numbers and buddha due to economy 
 Crime due to poverty, shoot up a dime of deuteronomy 
 Scramble with joshua, ghetto apostles packing epistles 
 Some were unsettled by their nostrils, 
 During the plague of crystal 
 I stood before many judges in the courtroom 
 They hold black grudges and use bails to extort you 
 Paroled like barabas, heist the finest fabrics 
 Ruthless thieves in the night 
 Who steal 6 days a week, then rest upon the sabbath 
 I drop a jewel like 1st and 2nd samuel 
 Kings stalking through hell, 
 Destined for treasures, I'ma do well 
 My ghetto chronicles are visual and mathematical 
 Emphatical, when I speak in street parables
