At 3:47, more than 150 rounds of ammunition 
 Were fired into your apartment, which is about 
 200 yards away, a few moments later, another 
 50 to 75 were fired on that street, in a direct 
 Sideline to your newstand, two policemen were 
 Killed, a car down the street past damn near 
 Less than 10 feet from where you were, turned 
 To the right and went directly in front of you, 
 And you're gonna stand there and tell me you 
 Didn't see a god damn thing?! 
 (Shabazz The Disciple) 
 Enter... enter the projects on the ferry 
 Scary, greet you at the gate with Bloody Mary's 
 Blood... blood... my ground full of blood 
 Back to the cemetery... get more blood 
 Standing on the graves drinking blood and smoking bones 
 We seen a crew of goons, running by with stolen tombstones 
 With Hell's Angels on the chase 
 He must've bust a black skull, who'll approach you, embrace 
 And tie you up in chains and they stomp on your face 
 They called it perpetory and they beat the fucking case 
 I look around, mad bodies being buried in the ground 
 The devil's busy snatching massive souls by the pound 
 Another piece of meat lays dead in the streets 
 Famillies in agony 'cause niggaz met their defeat 
 So, welcome to the Brooklyn house of pain 
 Where you gangbang, a blame slang without a sane 
 The slaughter house on the Hill 
 With Cypress and of the snipers, over-populated with vipers 
 This is the Hell where the mad God dwells 
 And the people are intoxicated by evil spells 
 You can't trust the future, so don't make plans 
 'Cause the everybody's trigger happy in this haunted house land 
 (Chorus x4: Kool G Rap sample) 
 You're... you're not promised tomorrow 
 In this little shop of horrors 
 (Shabazz The Disciple) 
 This Ruffhouse ain't in Columbia 
 But in a tough city where the area is scarier and bumpier 
 Where niggaz are quick to pull a glock in your mouth 
 A hot rock in your mouth, bust a shot in your mouth 
 And little shorty's living life on their own 
 Survive by the gun until they die by the gun 
 The atmosphere out here is full of curses 
 The verses, sending them to churches in hurses 
 The blow of death is always snuffing niggaz lives 
 They swallowed too many 22's and coke 45's 
 You never know when it's your day to get dropped by a stray 
 Bullet that ricochets off the wall in broad day 
 So many shots they fire inspire evil desire 
 Don't get caught up in Hell or on a cross in fire 
 Too many innocent blood stains on streets, the shit is too 
 The good are dying young but the evil's dead too 
 And what's to blame, we're all guilty of sin 
 But then again, there are a few good men 
 In the projects on the Hill, better known as Murderville 
 Where the chills turn to thrills, sudden urges to kill 
 And everybogy gots the murder-mentality 
 Out here your worst nightmare is someone's reality 
 The land's infested with evil creatures 
 Scary, witness cemetery-like features 
 Buildings like tombstones, the air is filled with dread 
 The living are possessed by spirits of evil dead 
 Bring them around, chasing, death breathing for the grave 
 In every building all these people understand is death slaves 
 Fiending to escape a conscious mindstate 
 Can't face reality 'cause their mentality can't hold the weight 
 Them people performing indescent preposals 
 And dumping newborns in garbage disposals 
 You'd better find a righteous path you can follow 
 'Cause you're not promised tomorrow in this little shop of horrors 
 (Shabazz The Disciple) 
 Today's forecast is a death storm, a fatal flood 
 Out sitting over the projects, raining blood 
 Mad souls drift away in a tornado 
 Baby's being held by the hand that rocks the cradle 
 And all the dead start to rise, death in their eyes 
 Suddenly hunt the one that took their lives 
 The walls of Hell are closing in on all sides 
 You're trapped in a death square with 30 foot ties 
 Souls drift a stray in the whirlpool spin 
 Ashes of a dead man blowing in the wind 
 Running for our lives, we've seen alice in chains 
 Sitting on a chair holding here own brain 
 A man laid slain in the rain 
 Rats knibbled on his brain until the morgue trucks came 
 Evil spirits deliver them souls to the soul fire 
 Flesh decaying while laying in the meyer 
 Trapped in the land of the lost, possessed by the cross 
 The holy force, headed for holocaust 
 Your religion's insanity, Christianity kills 
 The place's possessed by horror in Amittyville 
 That's why I'm trying to get up 'cause you're not promised tomorrow 
 I'm spearing straight out of the little shop of horrors 
 Yeah, yeah, no doubt 
 Yeah, yeah, spraying us out 
 Human beings
