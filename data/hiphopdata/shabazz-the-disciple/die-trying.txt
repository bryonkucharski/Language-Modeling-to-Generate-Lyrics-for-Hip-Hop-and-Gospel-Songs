'Preme, all right, 'Preme, 
 That roughneck shit is cool and all, 
 But what else you got, man? 
 (Aight, man, yo, man, check this 
 Shit out, I got some shit for the radio, 
 Man, I'm ready to fucking hit it) 
 (Sample) 
 "Brother, brother, brother" 
 (Shabazz The Disciple) 
 Once again, the intellectual black child 
 Is here to let knownledge be born on the track 
 While I massage your mental and exercise your temple 
 So potential as I rip the instrumental 
 I'm that type of brother that got shit locked down 
 Whoever tries to stand in my way, they gets knocked down 
 No time to relax, gotta move fast 
 Just pass the obsticles in my new path 
 It's time to blow up, I gotta work hard 
 'Cause when you're lazy, my brother, you gets barred 
 90 miles per an hour is the rate as I motivate 
 I have to eliminate the dead weight 
 Brothers are tugged along like children 
 Trying to slow me down and prevent me from building 
 Excellerating, prospering in Hell and 
 Evading to turn their lack of motivation 
 I revolve like the Earth rotates on it's axis 
 Bust some ass while my mother relaxes 
 Stay in the ghetto if you're willing to eat your own 
 I'm sick of living the lifestyle of the poor and alone 
 I've suffered enough, the struggle took mad long 
 It's time take and moan, control and add on 
 I knew deep down to myself that I wasn't lying 
 Either I'ma make it or I'ma die trying 
 (Chorus x1.5: "Sample", (Shabazz The Disciple)) 
 "Brother, brother, brother" 
 "I'll stand here" 
 "There's far too many struggles" 
 "I'll stand here" 
 (Either I'ma make it or I'ma die trying) 
 (Shabazz The Disciple) 
 I was raised in the place where you don't want to be 
 Drugs and guns over-rule the society 
 To me it's like an essence of drug dealers and murderers 
 Crack heads, prostitutes, drugs and burgulars 
 Whenever went on, I knew the cops were here into it 
 It took a crime for them to get to it 
 I've been to mad wakes and funerals 
 Most of y'all understand what that pressure can do to you 
 But I kept my mind in an upward glance 
 Expanding me skills, waiting for a chance 
 The day where I can rhyme and shine 
 And here I am getting paid to tell the world what's on my mind 
 Standing my grounds like I'm supposed to 
 Possess the skills most can't come close to 
 I won't stop fighting until it's time to 
 'Cause I have a destine to rule I will climb to 
 Besides all the pressure and the strain on my brain 
 I'm striving 'cause I was able to maintain 
 I didn't let no one change my decisions 
 Blow me off course and try to blurry my visions 
 Four plus a head with the skills that I'm blessed with 
 I'm going all out until the snake is infested 
 A community where everybody is dying 
 Either I'ma make it or I'ma die trying 
 (Shabazz The Disciple) 
 A lot of times I almost got wasted 
 Death was mad close, but I wasn't ready to face it 
 I know I'm still here for a purpose 
 Just seen all me people leaving in hurses 
 Most of my brothers were slain in the drug game 
 It tore me apart, but here I still remain 
 Have to feel the pain and it hurts, yo 
 There comes a point in life where you have to convert, so 
 Here I am striving for a little perfection 
 Headed in a new direction, using my mind for protection 
 Because your mind is worse than any other weapon 
 A feel luck that I didn't end up dying 
 All my brothers didn't make it, but they died trying
