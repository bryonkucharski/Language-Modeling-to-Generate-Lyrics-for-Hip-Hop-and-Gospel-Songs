Made-Madeleine 
 Mad about Madeleine 
 I've been born again 
 Glad about Madeleine 
 I rejoice amen 
 Sad without Madeleine 
 Right on course again 
 Mad about Madeleine 
 If you see me steppin' on down the street 
 Cool cat in the heat 
 Wasn't easy but now I'm glad I'm here 
 Grinnin' from ear to ear 
 Madeleine 
 I do believe that I've been born again 
 I've found a reason to rejoice amen 
 I've seen the light 
 I'm right on course again 
 Madeleine 
 Nothin' doin' I tip-toe through the mines 
 I've fallen on troubled times 
 War on road to ruin 
 Been down quite a while 
 Now I got a brand new style 
 Madeleine 
 I do believe that I've been born again 
 I've found a reason to rejoice amen 
 I've seen the light 
 I'm right on course again 
 Madeleine 
 I believe the world's a better place 
 Just because a smile's upon her face 
 Inch by inch she helped me find my way 
 And now I've finally found her 
 Gonna make my world around her 
 Mad about Madeleine 
 I've been born again 
 Glad about Madeleine 
 I rejoice amen 
 Sad without Madeleine 
 Right on course again 
 Mad about Madeleine 
 When things got bad to worse 
 You came to lift the curse 
 Stop thinkin' in reverse 
 Your light shine down on me 
 Had my back against the wall 
 Now I feel about ten feet tall 
 Threw my castaway 
 I thought about a brand new day 
 Madeleine 
 I do believe that I've been born again 
 I've found a reason to rejoice amen 
 I've seen the light 
 I'm right on course again 
 Madeleine 
 Mad about Madeleine 
 I've been born again 
 Glad about Madeleine 
 I rejoice amen 
 Sad without Madeleine 
 Right on course again 
 Mad about Madeleine 
 Mad about Madeleine 
 I've been born again 
 Glad about Madeleine 
 I rejoice amen 
 Sad without Madeleine 
 Right on course again 
 Mad about Madeleine
