Whenever your shadow falls 
 On stony ground 
 And there's not a hand for you to hold 
 Whenever the dreams you dream 
 Come crashing down 
 Every time you think of home 
 Remember that you're not alone 
 And we'll be with you heart and soul 
 Wherever you are 
 And if you should lose your path along the way 
 And find yourself walking in the dark 
 Whenever the ones you love seem far away 
 Every time you think of home 
 Remember that you're not alone 
 And we'll be with you heart and soul 
 Wherever you are 
 (Sail on home...) 
 Some are lost and some are lonely 
 Drifting away but they are only 
 Reaching out for love to hold onto 
 (Sail on home...) 
 Mother father sister brother 
 Giving strength to one another 
 Guide them where the healing waters flow 
 Every time you think of home 
 Remember that you're not alone 
 And we'll be with you heart and soul 
 Wherever you are
