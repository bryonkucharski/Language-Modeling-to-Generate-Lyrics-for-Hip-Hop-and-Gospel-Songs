I said that most of us are only 
 Playing away today 
 Look at us both, we're lost and lonely 
 No need to stay that way 
 I said let's spend the night together 
 Under the velvet sky 
 Losing our loneliness in pleasure 
 Baby, it's cold outside 
 She said the night's full of shadows 
 And shadows aren't real 
 They're just illusions, confusions 
 That lovers might feel 
 Under the veil of night 
 Blinded in passionate light 
 Forever cast by the shadows of love 
 I said we all need one another 
 What could be wrong with that 
 What could be wrong in taking cover 
 Even for just one night 
 She said a stranger's much too easy 
 Though it may comfort you 
 There's nothing but danger where it leads me 
 And nothing to hold onto 
 You see, the night's full of shadows 
 And shadows aren't real 
 They're just illusions, confusions 
 That lovers might feel 
 Under the veil of night 
 Blinded in passionate light 
 Forever cast by the shadows of love 
 'Cause night was made for you and me 
 So let defenses fall 
 Shadows fade eventually 
 They're only shadows after all 
 Under the veil of night 
 Blinded in passionate light 
 Forever cast by the shadows of love 
 She said the night's full of shadows 
 And shadows aren't real 
 They're just illusions, confusions 
 That lovers might feel 
 She said the night's full of shadows 
 And shadows aren't real 
 They're just illusions, confusions 
 That lovers might feel
