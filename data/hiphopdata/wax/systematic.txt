Hey! 
 Got my life worked out 'cause I was born a methodical man 
 Now that I'm all grown up I wanna put you in my master plan 
 If you turn me down, no problem at all 
 I've got a backup system and a failsafe wherewithal 
 I'll do what I have to do 
 Take one step at a time, for you 
 'Cause I'm systematic 
 Systematic, know what to do 
 Systematic 
 I'm systematically working on you 
 Hey! 
 Step by step I'm gonna wear your resistance down 
 I've got my mind made up and now my wheels are spinning around and around and around and around 
 I'm on the case 24 hours a day 
 Oh and I won't give up until you see things my way 
 Oh nothing can bother me 
 'Cause I look at it logically 
 'Cause I'm systematic 
 Systematic, know what to do 
 Systematic 
 I'm systematically working on you 
 Systematic (woo) 
 Systematic, know what to do 
 Systematic (ow!) 
 I'm systematically working on you 
 Hey! 
 Yup. 
 I'll do what I have to do 
 Take one step at a time, for you 
 'Cause I'm systematic 
 Systematic, know what to do 
 Systematic 
 I'm systematically working on you 
 Systematic (woo) 
 Systematic, know what to do 
 Systematic 
 'Cause I'm systematically working on you 
 Systematic 
 Systematic (ow!) 
 Systematic 
 Systematic 
 Hey!
