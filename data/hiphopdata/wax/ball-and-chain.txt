I am a working man 
 Doing the best I can 
 I toe the line each day 
 To those who set the pace 
 I'm just another face 
 But someday soon I'll lose this 
 Ball and chain 
 Everyday's a life of pain 
 Ball and chain 
 Feel like I'm dragging round this ball and chain 
 I'm only flesh and bone 
 Still they want blood from stone 
 And they cry more more more 
 Someday they'll know my name 
 If I can stand the strain 
 And I won't have to haul this 
 Ball and chain 
 Everyday's a life of pain 
 Ball and chain 
 Feel like I'm dragging 'round a ball and chain 
 Someday I'm gonna break out 
 And I'll be free 
 And living in paradise 
 I won't have to crawl 
 I'll walk with my head held high 
 Well day after day 
 And week after week 
 They wear you down 
 Till you're dead on your feet 
 And what do you get? 
 What do you got? 
 You got nothin' 
 So you stay where you are 
 For security sake 
 You got a family to feed 
 And pennies to make 
 It's a damn... 
 Ball and chain 
 Everyday's a life of pain 
 Ball and chain 
 Feel like I'm dragging round a ball and chain 
 Ball and chain...
