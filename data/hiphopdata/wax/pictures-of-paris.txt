Right bank left bank 
 Two troubled souls on a starry French night 
 She goes he stays 
 All on his own in the city of lights 
 All that he's left with are pictures of Paris 
 Memories of her on the Champs Elysees 
 Trashing his life on the sidewalks of Paris 
 She said love's dead 
 She walks away as he sits there in shame 
 Gets drunk, heart sunk 
 Watching his dreams as they float down the Seine 
 All that he's left with are pictures of Paris 
 Memories of her on the Champs Elysees 
 Trashing his life on the sidewalks of Paris 
 Cafes soirees 
 He should feel happy but now it's all wrong 
 Bells peel but now he feels more like 
 The Hunchback of Notre Dame 
 All that he's left with are pictures of Paris 
 Memories of her on the Champs Elysees 
 Trashing his life on the sidewalks of Paris 
 East side West side 
 Back in New York he is hungry and wet 
 Last chance romance 
 Pictures of Paris are all he has left 
 Maybe
