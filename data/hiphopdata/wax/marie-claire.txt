Well you did what you had to do 
 When your back's to the wall what else can you do 
 And you're pushed just a little too far 
 Now the heat is on, and here you are 
 Well I waited my life for you 
 I said I'd always be there no matter what you do 
 Between the devil and the deep blue sea 
 And if that's where you want me, then that's where I'll be 
 Don't keep me waiting Marie Claire 
 I know there's a place for us somewhere 
 We'll be together now 
 Find our way out somehow 
 Your secret's safe with me I swear 
 Don't keep me waiting Marie Claire 
 Well you never gave me a chance 
 To be more than a victim of circumstance 
 Now I find myself lying for you 
 And I'll do anything that you want me to 
 I don't care if it's right or wrong 
 I don't care who the world tries to blame this on 
 You're the one thing that's right in my life 
 And I can't let you turn me away tonight 
 Don't keep me waiting Marie Claire 
 I know there's a place for us somewhere 
 We'll be together now 
 Find our way out somehow 
 Your secret's safe with me I swear 
 Don't keep me waiting Marie Claire
