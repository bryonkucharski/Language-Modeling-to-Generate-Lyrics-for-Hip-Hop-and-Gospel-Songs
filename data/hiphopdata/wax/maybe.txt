Maybe just lately I'm lonely 
 Maybe things at home not what they should be 
 And maybe I notice the way you act around me 
 But you shouldn't take it too seriously 
 Maybe I called you but that doesn't mean 
 That I really want you closer to me 
 But maybe I knew we'd both end up here in this way 
 You, you make it so easy to stray 
 Maybe I'm tempted but it ain't right 
 Maybe I better say goodnight 
 But maybe I'm human and passion's strong 
 Maybe I can't stop what we've begun 
 Maybe there's trouble for me and my wife 
 Maybe our coming here was unwise 
 But maybe I see my reflection in your shining eyes 
 You, you make it too easy to stay 
 Maybe I'm tempted but it ain't right 
 Maybe I better say goodnight 
 But maybe I'm human and passion's strong 
 Maybe I can't stop what we've begun 
 Want you too much 
 Yes I want you too much 
 Yes I burn for your touch 
 Ooh 
 Lookin' that way 
 You make it to easy for me 
 Ooh 
 To lose control 
 Maybe I'm tempted but it ain't right 
 Maybe I better say goodnight 
 But maybe I'm human and passion's strong 
 Maybe I can't stop what we've begun
