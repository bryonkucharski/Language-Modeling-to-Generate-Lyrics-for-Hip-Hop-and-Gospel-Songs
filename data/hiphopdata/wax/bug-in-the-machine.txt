I know you must've phoned 
 Cause you can't live without me 
 But my answering machine 
 Must be going on the blink 
 I know you want to say 
 Want to say you're sorry 
 But the message on the phone 
 Sounded like "leave me alone" 
 I must've bought a faulty unit 
 You couldn't want a world without me in it 
 And up till now it was working like a dream 
 Uh oh uh oh 
 Bug in the machine 
 Must be something wrong 
 Got a bad connection 
 The wires must be crossed 
 I know it can't be you I lost 
 Your voice was sounding strange to me 
 Like on your own was what you want to be 
 Reuniteds what I'm sure you mean 
 Uh oh uh oh 
 Bug in the machine 
 Oh I'm standing on the edge 
 Of a nervous breakdown 
 Cause an answering machine 
 You and I has come between 
 Can't hold a one way conversation 
 I need some real communication 
 I'd like to fix that little green 
 Uh oh uh oh 
 Bug in the machine 
 I know you must've phoned 
 'Cause you can't live without me 
 My answering machine 
 Must be going on the blink
