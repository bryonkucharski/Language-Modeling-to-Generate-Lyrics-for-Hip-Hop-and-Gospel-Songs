I remember warm and tender sighs 
 The night before she said goodbye 
 The song that we liked playing just for her and I 
 Now when I hear it I just come apart 
 It's like a needle in my heart 
 Each time the music starts 
 Please DJ don't put that on 
 We fell in love to that one 
 Don't play that song on the radio 
 It's so hard to forget 
 So here is my request 
 Don't play that song on the radio 
 I recall the way she held my arm 
 As we were dancing in the dawn 
 The radio on 
 Swaying to the same old song 
 It used to sound just like a lullaby 
 But now it only makes me cry 
 So don't play that one tonight 
 Please DJ don't put that on 
 We fell in love to that one 
 Don't play that song on the radio 
 It's so hard to forget 
 So here is my request 
 Don't play that song on the radio 
 On and on and round and round 
 The record spins 
 Everytime it's on I keep rememberin' 
 The things we did together 
 Now they're gone forever 
 Round and round it keeps repeating 
 In my ear 
 All the words of love that I won't ever hear 
 I'm walkin' in the rain (remember) 
 Don't play that song again 
 Please DJ don't put that on 
 We fell in love to that one 
 Don't play that song on the radio 
 It's so hard to forget 
 So here is my request 
 Don't play that song on the radio
