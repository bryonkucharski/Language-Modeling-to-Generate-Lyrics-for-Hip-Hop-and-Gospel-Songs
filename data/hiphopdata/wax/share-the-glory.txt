Working girl 
 Pinstripe and pearls 
 Making your own 
 Way in the world 
 Nobody gets in your way 
 Nothing can stop you 
 Now there's nothing to tie you down 
 'Cause you got what you wanted 
 But did you get what you need 
 When there's nobody there to share the glory 
 Working girl 
 How will you know 
 (When you reach that rainbow) 
 Is your dream alive 
 If it doesn't come true 
 (Will you win more than you lose) 
 Every step of the way 
 I was behind you 
 And now you don't even turn around 
 'Cause you got what you wanted 
 But did you get what you need 
 When there's nobody there to share the glory 
 Got what you wanted 
 But did you get what you need 
 When there's nobody there to share the glory 
 I hear you talking 'bout your high ideas 
 But you ain't even with me when you're here 
 You burnt your bridges, don't look back 
 'Cause I ain't gonna be there 
 'Cause you got what you wanted, didn't ya? 
 But did you get what you need 
 Oh, there's nobody there to share the glory 
 Got what you wanted, yeah, yeah 
 But did you get what you need 
 When there's nobody there to share the glory
