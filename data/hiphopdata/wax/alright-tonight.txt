Baby 
 I know you've been hurt 
 This world can be hard on your soul 
 Heartless and painful I know 
 But time 
 Time is on your side 
 And what seems unbearable now 
 Will one day seem funny somehow 
 We are all right 
 We are all right 
 We are all right tonight 
 This world 
 This world can be so cruel 
 Making your dreams disappear 
 Just when you thought you were so near 
 Oh but this world 
 This world can be so kind oh yeah 
 Finding its own wonderous way 
 Of healing the heartache some way 
 We are all right 
 We are all right 
 We are all right tonight 
 If you're down on your luck 
 Just call on me 
 If you don't know where to turn yeah 
 Just call on me 
 And if you're lonely lonely lonely lonely 
 You know where I'll be 
 I'll be your shelter your guarantee
