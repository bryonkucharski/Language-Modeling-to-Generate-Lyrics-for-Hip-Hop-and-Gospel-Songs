It's no misunderstanding 
 When pain goes hand in hand 
 You always play the bad guy 
 She the sacrificial lamb 
 Feel as vulnerable as a woman 
 And she takes it like a man 
 Listen what he said she said 
 He said she said 
 Push and pull up and down 
 Back and forth on the merry go round 
 And on and on it goes till someone throws it away 
 You'll pay for your admission 
 When you find you're losing ground 
 So you fight for your position 
 But nobody's backing down 
 You thought you'd spoken clearly 
 But she reads between the lines 
 Listen what he said she said 
 He said she said 
 Push and pull up and down 
 Back and forth on the merry go round 
 And on and on it goes till someone throws it away 
 Why can't we agree to be more tender 
 Surrender mmm - mmm 
 If two people care it should be easy happy 
 Why can't we be? 
 He said she said 
 You'll try to make the best of it 
 While looking in her eyes 
 'Til you find yourself in trouble 
 And you learn to compromise 
 But still somehow you just keep thinkin' 
 That she hurt your foolish pride 
 Listen what he said she said 
 He said she said
