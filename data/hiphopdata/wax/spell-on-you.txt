Little by little 
 I feel you slippin' from me 
 He's playin' his hand 
 And now its easy to see 
 Oh baby now little by little 
 You're takin' him seriously 
 And I'm so scared of where it ends 
 You're in too deep to be just friends 
 Somebody went and put a spell on you 
 Makin' you do what you shouldn't do 
 Hypnotised you into playin' a fool 
 Somebody went and put a spell on you 
 Little by little 
 He's tryin' to take you away 
 And if you want to go 
 I guess there's nothing to say 
 Oh baby now don't do that 
 I want you to stay 
 Protect our love, don't let it slip 
 Just hold on fast, or I'll lose my grip 
 Somebody went and put a spell on you 
 Makin' you do what you shouldn't do 
 Hypnotised you into playin' a fool 
 Somebody went and put a spell on you 
 Shake it up shake it up shake it up 
 Shake it up baby 
 Ah don't you know 
 He's playing a dangerous game 
 Break it up, break it up 
 Break it up now 
 Before it goes too far 
 'Cause the magic's got to end 
 And you'll be left without a friend 
 Little by little 
 You're takin' him seriously 
 And I'm so scared of where it ends 
 You're in too deep to be just friends 
 Somebody went and put a spell on you 
 Makin' you do what you shouldn't do 
 Hypnotised you into playin' a fool 
 Somebody went and put a spell on you
