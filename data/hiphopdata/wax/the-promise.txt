Leaves are falling green and gold 
 Changing of the season 
 Safe and warm against the cold 
 Within our house new life unfolds 
 These are the promised days 
 From cradle to the grave 
 This is the special time 
 In which the light will shine 
 Welcome to the human world 
 Filled with love and hatred 
 Some are rich and some are poor 
 Unto this world our child is born 
 These are the promised days 
 From cradle to the grave 
 This is the special time 
 In which the light will shine 
 He's coming 
 She's coming 
 Someone to build a new world for us 
 He's coming 
 She's coming 
 To keep the promise in all of us 
 Heed the warning wind that blows 
 Ignorance and evil 
 Rapes the harvest that we sow 
 Crush the flower where it grows 
 These are the promised days 
 From cradle to the grave 
 This is the special time 
 In which the light will shine
