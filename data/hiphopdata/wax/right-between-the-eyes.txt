True love for me was nothing but a mystery 
 Just something only captured in a dream 
 Oh, then suddenly 
 It was hitting me 
 Right between the eyes 
 I wasn't looking for a love explosion 
 But I must have been a target my oh my 
 'Cause when I least expected it 
 I took a direct hit 
 Right between the eyes 
 You, you shattered my resistance, yes it's true 
 You battered my defence, what could I do? 
 I'm running from the heat between me and you 
 You hit me with a million volts 
 Nailed me with a lightning bolt 
 Oh, baby, you knocked me cold 
 Your love has zapped me, right between the eyes 
 Now nothing's going to cool down my desire 
 'Cause I'm jumpin' from the fat into the fire 
 Love bug has bitten me 
 And you're hitting me 
 Right between the eyes 
 And now, each time I think about you I don't know how 
 I ever did without you, you spin me 'round 
 And I'll never get my feet back on the ground 
 You hit me with a million volts 
 Nailed me with a lightning bolt 
 Oh, baby, you knocked me cold 
 Your love has zapped me, right between the eyes 
 Oh, the power of your love is much too strong 
 You turn me on 
 You hit me with a million volts 
 Nailed me with a lightning bolt 
 Oh, baby, you knocked me cold, yeah 
 Your love has zapped me, right between the eyes 
 You hit me with a million volts 
 Nailed me with a lightning bolt 
 Oh, baby, you knocked me cold 
 Your love has zapped me, right between the eyes 
 Dig it 
 (Dig it, dig it) 
 (Yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 (Dig it, dig it) 
 (Yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 (Dig it, dig it)
