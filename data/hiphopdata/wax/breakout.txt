 From the west side 
 To the east side 
 Love is unchained tonight 
 Under street lights 
 Or by candle light 
 Love is unchained tonight 
 Strange vision on the floor 
 Someone you've never seen before 
 Feel the presence of a mystery 
 Yeah, it's time to set your inhibition free 
 Breakout

 From the east end 
 To the west end 
 Whoa, love is unchained tonight 
 Feel the power 
 Got the spell again 
 Whoa, love is unchained tonight 
 With every step your spirits climb 
 The spotlight tonight will shine 
 I don't act hypnotised 
 Yeah, it's calling for you on the party line
