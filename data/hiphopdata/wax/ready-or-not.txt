The time has come for you to fly on your own 
 You don't have to be afraid 
 We'll always be here to catch you when you fall 
 Yes you're all grown up today 
 So ready or not 
 Time to break out 
 Out of your shell into the blue 
 Spread your wings across the sky 
 Ready or not 
 Time to find out 
 What does the future hold for you 
 Fly away fly away fly away 
 The time has come for you to open your eyes 
 There's a brand new world to see 
 You've got the power to face it on your own 
 And fulfill your destiny 
 So ready or not 
 Time to break out 
 Out of your shell into the blue 
 Spread your wings across the sky 
 Ready or not 
 Time to find out 
 What does the future hold for you 
 Fly away fly away fly away 
 You gotta spread your wings 
 Spread your wings 
 Fly away and cast your fate to the wind 
 Remember don't look back 
 Don't you ever look back 
 Let the moment carry you 
 So ready or not 
 Time to break out 
 Out of your shell into the blue 
 Spread your wings across the sky 
 Ready or not 
 Time to find out 
 What does the future hold for you 
 Fly away fly away fly away 
 Fly away fly away fly away
