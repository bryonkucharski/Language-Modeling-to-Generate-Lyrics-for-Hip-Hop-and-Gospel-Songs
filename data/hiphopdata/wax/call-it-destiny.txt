Meet me where you heart and the highway runs tonight, tonight 
 Jump into these wheels of fire and together we'll ride, we'll ride 
 Somewhere where we've never been 
 Somewhere where a chance is taken on a dream 
 Somewhere where we can begin 
 To let some passion out and some freedom in 
 Well, somewhere in this mixed up and crazy world there's a place, there's a place 
 Where people like us can be free to make our own mistakes, get a break 
 Come on there's no reason to wait 
 To realize the brave new world we can create 
 Now before it gets too late 
 Spin the wheel, shake the hand of fate 
 Call it destiny 
 Every step you take leads you where you should be 
 Call it destiny 
 'Cause you can't escape what was meant to be 
 Call it destiny 
 Aw, come on make a stand take my hand and don't ever let go, no no 
 It's written in the stars in the cars on the radio, let's go 
 Somewhere where we've never been 
 Somewhere where a chance is taken on a dream 
 Somewhere where we can begin 
 To let some passion out and some freedom in 
 Call it destiny 
 Every step you take leads you where you should be 
 Call it destiny 
 'Cause you can't escape what was meant to be 
 Call it destiny 
 Every step you take leads you where you should be 
 Call it destiny 
 'Cause you can't escape what was meant to be 
 Meet me where you heart and the highway runs tonight 
 Oh, sweet freedom 
 Jump into these wheels of fire and together we'll ride 
 Ooh, yeah, yeah
