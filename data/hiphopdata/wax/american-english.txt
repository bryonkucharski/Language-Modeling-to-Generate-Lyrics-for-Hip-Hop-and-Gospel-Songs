Here comes my one and only 
 Talking like a starlet on a Hollywood screen 
 She whispers something to me 
 I hear the words but I don't know what she means 
 Oh, she speaks American English 
 Oh, don't always understand 
 Though she speaks American English 
 Got the language of love at her command 
 Love travels transatlantic 
 I'm hot and bothered by her figure of speech 
 Can't follow her semantics 
 But when her body moves it's clear to me 
 Oh, she speaks American English 
 Oh, don't always understand 
 Though she speaks American English 
 Got the language of love at her command 
 Hey! 
 Come on, yeah 
 Come on, yeah, woo 
 We don't need words 
 To express what is real 
 We've got each other 
 That says everything that we feel 
 There's too much damn confusion 
 With all this talking going round and round 
 We'll reach our own conclusion 
 We'll make connection on the common ground 
 I said, 
 Oh, she speaks American English 
 Oh, don't always understand 
 Though she speaks American English 
 Got the language of love at her command 
 Oh, she speaks American English 
 Oh, don't always understand 
 Though she speaks American English 
 Got the language of love at her command 
 Hey! 
 Come on, yeah 
 Come on, yeah 
 Come on, woo 
 She speaks American English 
 She speaks the language of love 
 She speaks American English 
 She speaks American English 
 She speaks the language of love 
 She speaks American English 
 She speaks American English 
 She speaks the language of love 
 She speaks American English 
 She speaks American English 
 She speaks the language of love 
 She speaks American English
