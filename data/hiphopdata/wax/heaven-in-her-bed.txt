Golden sands sunny days 
 A beautiful girl in emerald waves 
 Out of my depth 
 Over my head 
 I found heaven in her bed 
 A mystery 
 Revealed to me 
 Higher than I'd ever been 
 Out of this world 
 I was hurled 
 Faster and faster 
 And now I'm falling 
 Floating in a silken stream 
 Drifting through a velvet dream 
 Out of sync 
 Out of time 
 Out of body 
 Out of mind 
 We shared a slice 
 Of paradise 
 How could I ever look back 
 Into her web 
 I was led 
 Over and over 
 And I'm still falling 
 Down below the surface 
 Where the heart and soul of me 
 Dissolves into the whirlpool 
 Of emotion running free 
 All of my resistance 
 Disappears without a trace 
 I'm open to suggestion 
 I am flying I am flying 
 High above the mountains 
 And high above the clouds 
 Soaring with a passion 
 That inside is bursting out 
 And I can almost see forever 
 Shining like the sparkle in her eyes 
 A mystery 
 Revealed to me 
 Higher than I'd ever been 
 Out of this world 
 I was hurled 
 Faster and faster 
 And now I'm falling 
 Golden sands sunny days 
 A beautiful girl in emerald waves 
 Out of my depth 
 Over my head 
 I found heaven in her bed 
 Heaven in her bed
