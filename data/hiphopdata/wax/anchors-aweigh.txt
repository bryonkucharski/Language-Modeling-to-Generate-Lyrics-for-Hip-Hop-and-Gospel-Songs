Eighteen 
 I'd never been far from home 
 A young lad seekin' destiny 
 This ship 
 With a hundred hands or more 
 To set sail on a stormy sea 
 I don't know how we can find our way 
 With only the stars in the sky 
 To be our guide 
 I was green inside 
 When I heard the captain calling 
 Anchors aweigh now 
 Anchors aweigh 
 We're underway now 
 Anchors aweigh 
 I've heard tales of boats that ran aground 
 Ghost ships dead in the sun 
 And of men bewitched by the siren's song 
 Those that died were the lucky ones 
 One wave can knock a man overboard 
 And in the name of the crown 
 A man could drown 
 I was feeling down 
 When I heard the captain calling 
 Anchors aweigh now 
 Anchors aweigh 
 We're underway now 
 Anchors aweigh
