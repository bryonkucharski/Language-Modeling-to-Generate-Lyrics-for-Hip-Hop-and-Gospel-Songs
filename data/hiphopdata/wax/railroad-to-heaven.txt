We're gonna take a trip to some new destination 
 I got a pair of tickets for a dream tonight 
 You don't know what love is like 
 Baby till you ride on the good love line 
 'Cause we'll be travellin' on a train to Paradise 
 Won't you pack your bags and ride the 
 Railroad to heaven 
 Steamin' through the dark 
 Get on the right track baby 
 Choo-choo round my heart 
 Woo-woo-woo woh yeah 
 I wanna be your driver wanna be your conductor 
 Make a reservation on the Love Express 
 My heart is just speedin' away 
 'Cause our love is like a runaway train 
 I don't ever want to slow this motion down 
 Baby we're just ridin' on the 
 Railroad to heaven 
 Steamin' through the dark 
 Get on the right track baby 
 Choo-choo round my heart 
 Woo-woo-woo woh yeah 
 Passin' cars and countin' stars 
 We'd watch the world go by 
 Let's make a locomotion 
 Shakin' up the floor 
 Just give me a little signal now Honey 
 All on board Ha! 
 Railroad to heaven 
 Steamin' through the dark 
 Get on the right track baby 
 Choo-choo round my heart 
 Woo-woo-woo woh yeah
