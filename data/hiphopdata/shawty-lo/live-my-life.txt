 I was thrown in the game in '76, 
 By the year '93 I was in the mix, 
 Knee lan key said we had bad ways 
 Old folks say we gon shaun our days, 
 Slow ya roll Shawty, Pump ya breaks, 
 Life ain't peachy in the Georgia state, 
 U.S.D.A, yeah she's with in 
 Now I'm puttin' in a laugh with the government, 
 Now I'm bein watched by the government, 
 Still bein watched by the government 
 A Town, Westside I represent, 
 And all that hatin' is irrelevant 
 I been gettin' my blessings ever since 
 Ain't sayin' I'm a angel but I'm heaven sent 
 God please bless all americans, 
 Please bless all americans 
 If I die tomorrow 
 I could be mad (could be mad) 
 I dun seen my life (I dun seen my life) 
 I dun lived my life (lived my life) 
 If I die tomorrow 
 I could be mad (could be mad) 
 I dun seen my life (I dun seen my life) 
 I dun lived my life (lived my life)

 There's a war going on in Newaga Streets 
 Still going on in Shilver street 
 Why things gotta be the way they be? 
 I thought Abe Lincoln said we was free 
 From the things I see, that can not be 
 In the court room yeah where, roam, we 
 The laws and the gestures (still thug life) 
 That why my partners (got all this time) 
 Cause that's why Brian Nichols lost his mind 
 We'll never know till the end of time (aye!) 
 Till the end of time 
 We'll never know till the end of time (aye!)
