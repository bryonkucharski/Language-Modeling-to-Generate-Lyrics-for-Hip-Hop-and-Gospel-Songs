 Ya stankin' bitches! Dey say dey love me 
 Bitch I love y'all too 
 First 'night stand make it do what it do 
 Lo dat, Lo dat, go on and take a feel 
 This, this, this definition of real 
 A-Town, Bankhead, my streets 
 The real OG's can vouche for me 
 Skintight, Fat Steve, Big D 
 Even Cueball loved the streets

 I'm blowin' hundred like the cameras on the cake hoe 
 Cuz I'm addin' Arm & Hammer on my cake hoe 
 I'm gettin' hundreds and hundreds and hundreds 
 I'm in the trap screamin' money, mo money, mo money 
 And I'm the motha fuckin' hustleman 
 I hold the pot and work the phone with my other hand 
 I got the j's at my window like brotherman 
 Cuz I hit the pot like I got a couple hands 
 Ay, I got a rubberband bank boy 
 From makin' plays on them thousand gram cakes boy 
 Dubbs, 50's and 100's 
 Got me throwin' up money like I'm sick to my stomach

 I ride, I die 
 For the M-O-N-E-Y 
 Westside, eastside 
 M-O-N-E-Y 
 Northside, southside 
 Nigga, M-O-N-E-Y 
 We ride, we die 
 For the M-O-N-E-Y!
