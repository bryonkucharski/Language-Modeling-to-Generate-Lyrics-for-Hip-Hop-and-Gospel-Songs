 It's Soulja Boy Tellem, 
 I rap with Shawty Low, 
 I got so much snow, 
 Gucci head to toe, 
 Chain on chill (chill), 
 Watch on freeze, 
 A pound a purp got me looking like Chinese, 
 Gucci Shades, but they still can't hide me, 
 Hit the club, seventeen with no ID, 
 Damn! I changed up the format, 
 Welcome to my crib, 
 Leave your shoes at the doormat, 
 Uh, and ain't this Beat tight, 
 Chains say hello, 
 Watch say goodnight, 
 And I still look right, 
 This is the good life, 
 Gucci Bandanna just to make me look tight 
 Gucci Bandanna, 
 Call me Gucci Montel, 
 Gucci girl with me, 
 Gucci bag, 
 Gucci sandals, 
 She too hot to handle, 
 Hot sex, burning candles, 
 Gucci Mane a player, 
 Gucci shopping this extravagant, 
 Gucci Mane drive a drop top red phantom, 
 And my bed got them super size Gucci spreads, 
 Pull up to the hood, 
 Stop and let them jock Gucci, 
 Broads jock Gucci, cause Gucci, just Gucci, 
 Yeah my boxer briefs, 
 Equipped with double G's, 
 Gucci key chain, 
 Holding on my Gucci keys, 
 Gucci down all the time in the summer time, 
 I'm Gucci Mane, 
 You would think that was my clothing line, 
 Gucci 
 Shawty Lo, 
 I really want a Lanna, 
 Scarf on my neck, 
 Gucci Bandanna, 
 Niggas talking slick, 
 They filled with anmnem, 
 But I don't care, 
 So Got damn ya, 
 This biggest watch, 
 Costs more than yours, 
 I built a house, 
 You can't afford, 
 It's Stupid Big, 
 It got an ocean view, it's way up there, 
 I look down on you, 
 We flexed down here, 
 That's what we do, 
 Get in our way, 
 I flex on you, 
 You acting monkey, 
 We keep bananas, 
 Dem goons with me, 
 Rocking bandanna,
