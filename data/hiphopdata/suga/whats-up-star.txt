Hit the carwash to get a fresh shine 
 I don't know how you buy yours but that's how I like mine 
 Think girls don't style, how ya figure 
 One arm's on my steering wheel, the other arm's around my nigga 
 This pocket's phat, don't get offended cause 
 Somebody makes it so somebody's gotta spend it 
 I take it from the boardroom to the boulevard 
 Troopin' all the players like I play cards 
 I pump up my Jeep and get hot 
 And once I put my tape in the slot my speakers hit the jackpot 
 Time time for some action, I got to be the main attraction 
 Blowin' up like Toni Braxton 
 Pick my girls up to check the party uptown 
 I leave my shorty home 'cause I'm tryina fuck around 
 At the sportsbar, honeys everywhere are lookin' mink 
 What's up star, let's get a drink 
 What's up star, I'd like to get to know who you are 
 Let's have drinks at the bar 
 What's up star, I'd like to get to know who you are 
 And if I like what I see then the drinks is on me 
 Well is it you or is it me, uh, I saw you glancin' 
 I peeped you from the door and on the floor when you was dancin' 
 This is the pick up line, I got the big up mine 
 I'm steppin' to ya like a stick up 
 I don't have to drop on ya 
 So let's go get a drink on the low and kick in in the corner 
 To the bar start walkin' and I'ma hit you off 
 On some of that good shit I was talkin' 
 I hope to keep you interested, you should get with this kid 
 And if you lucky you could hit this 
 But don't get souped, it's just a conversation at the bar star 
 And if ya slip you get the scissor 
 Cuties everywhere I turn, when am I gonna learn 
 I be outta control, I see what I want and I roll 
 I get the digits quick from the honeys, they be fly and all that 
 But right now that's not where my head is at 
 Over and over again I step off quickly with my friends 
 To put this little love shit to a dead end 
 I got to stay on point, checkin' the honey with a tag 
 I got to bag my next chick 
 And there he is lookin' kosher, posin' like a poster 
 I won't bite come a little closer 
 I wanna talk but it's loud shit 
 And it's gettin' kinda hot in this crowd shit 
 So step over to the bar, and let's kick that lingo 
 I like to mingle, honey are ya single 
 If I give you the OK that means I like what I see 
 What's up star drinks is on me 
 Sex on the beach and gin and juice 
 Nobody likes tea it makes me get loose 
 A glass of Moet and Alize 
 Cause this type of shit happens every day
