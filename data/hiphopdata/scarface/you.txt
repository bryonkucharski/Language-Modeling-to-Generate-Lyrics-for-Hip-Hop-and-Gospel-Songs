 I been there, done that, grew from my fuck ups 
 A hard head make a nigga soft ass tougher 
 My momma used to say that one day I'd suffer 
 If I ain't tighten up and get my shit right, trust her 
 I'm seventeen out here living the life 
 And I ain't never coming back home, you giving advice 
 To a nigga don't need it, I want my freedom 
 To hang on the corners running from the policemen 
 If I knew then what I know right now, I would have sat my stupid ass back down 
 I wouldn't listen 
 'Cause what she told me in the end came true 
 What you do to me your kids goin' do, times two 
 Forgive me momma I ain't mean no harm 
 But let her tell it, I ain't seen no storm. It's just beginning 
 But in a minute I'll be waving the flag 'cause I don't think that I can take all that 
 (Ceelo Green) 
 Me and my mother are like sister and brother 
 She said 
 Son I've done things I'm ashamed of, but I had to do" 
 I've lived longer and secrets made me stronger 
 And you wonder how I already knew 
 It's 'cause I'm already you 
 (Scarface) 
 I remember walking home from a party we had shut down fighting 
 They came from another neighorhood so we ain't liking it 
 The beatdown started from the inside, wiped them 
 From one side to the other side like Tyson 
 We heard gun shots and ran like lightning 
 Heart beat way too fast, I'm frightened 
 That's when I realized that niggas pack guns too 
 And not afraid to shoot a motherfucker if he had to 
 We was some young dudes, living life wreckless 
 Drinking MD, vandalizing shit, restless 
 We went from stealing hotshots getting sessted 
 To kick those burglaries, Warren got arrested 
 That's when them dip had us thinking we was bad man 
 When Eric B. said to 
 clap your hands 
 I'm just imagining the shit I did 
 If what I've done is goin' affect my kids 
 Shit

 (Scarface) 
 I seen myself where my mom was 
 My mom like my grandmom, my kids like I am 
 Every day is like a standoff 
 Don't fuck up like I fucked up 
 You may not be as lucky, I'm a rare case 
 Coulda went the other way, trust me 
 Just do your best and I ain't mad if you miss it 
 You are gifted, it's up to you to make the best decision 
 'Cause one day I'll be leaving this game and y'all have to carry on my name 
 OK
