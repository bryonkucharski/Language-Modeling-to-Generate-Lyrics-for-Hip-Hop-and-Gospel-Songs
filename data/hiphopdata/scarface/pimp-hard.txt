(Verse 1 - Scarface) 
 I use to watch you on stage gettin'money, lookin' lovely 
 Got these niggaz offerin they pockets tippin you twenties 
 'Cause you cold with that shit that you do... ya mood shocked me 
 Unlike these other hoes in ya crew you don't jock me 
 I'd like to get ya phone number just to see what you about 
 Call you for breakfast to get you out 
 And see if you just some eyes without a face 
 Let me see ya crib - take me to ya place 
 I wanna show you that it's mo'to me then fuckin' on my mind 
 'Cause in yo mind I bet you fuckin' all the time 
 Come to find you only out tryin' to go to school 
 And tryna go to school and pay bills is hard to do 
 I see you fool so go on and do ya thing 
 But when you tired of showin ya titties give me a ring 
 I like a woman gettin' hers cause that's better 
 Then her tryna come up off mine I can't let her 
 (Chorus - Bun B sampled) 
 Go on and let a nigga peak, and let a nigga poke 
 Go on get naked for me streak, and let a nigga stroke (Repeat 4x) 
 (Verse 2 - Z-Ro) 
 Go on and let a nigga peak, go on and let a nigga poke 
 Give me some assistance as I maneuver my long stroke 
 I hope you don't think I'm payin'for it that's the wrong hope 
 'Cause I know you wanna be Z'Rollin' over chrome spokes 
 Bitch I know you wanna tell ya girlfriends how it was 
 To get hit from the back, in the back of the 'Lac by a thug 
 And to get ran through until you get carpet burns off the rug 
 And to get nutted on by nine niggaz with diamond grills and guns 
 And how you got on my microphone and sung a sixteen 
 Ya performance deserves a grammy check out my big screen 
 Most bitches don't know but you know what suckin a dick mean 
 Yeah the head was fed but what up with that in them jeans 
 I can see the pussy (?) lookin' like a big bee 
 Make ya cycle start early my shovel be diggin deep 
 I don't wanna relationship, I just want me some relations 
 Go on and let a nigga poke hoe, and stop shuckin with my patience 
 (Chorus - Bun B sampled) 
 Go on and let a nigga peak, and let a nigga poke 
 Go on get naked for me streak, and let a nigga stroke (Repeat 4x) 
 (Verse 3 - Pimp C) 
 Bitch get down on me at the drop of a dime 
 Fuck all that R & B singin' shit I ain't got the time 
 I'd rather bust yo'ass up with some screwed and chopped 
 Let me test ya jaws and let me stretch out ya cotton 
 I'm still Pimp C bitch, the name ain't changed 
 Puttin' stick up in these hoes don't remember they name 
 'Cause we tired of playin' games with them booty lickers 
 'Cause we jumped up in ya life, 'cause I'm a true dirt digger 
 So go on hit the streets, break them lame tricks 
 Then bring it back to daddy that's how you can get this dick 
 I need the cash first - and the ass last 
 And we can blow dro in the Benz while I smash on the gas 
 So let a nigga pimp, and let a nigga mack 
 And later on tonight you can get hit up in ya back... and get ya money back 
 But when I make ya pussy skeet bitch you gon'buy me a 'Lac 
 (Chorus - Bun B sampled) 
 Go on and let a nigga peak, and let a nigga poke 
 Go on get naked for me streak, and let a nigga stroke (Repeat 4x) 
 (Verse 4 - Juvenile) 
 I ain't tryna talk a hole in yo head 
 But I can tell you didn't excel what them hoes done said 
 Starrin' at my neck and my wrist 'cause my shit is frozen red 
 And I look like a easy hustler so go ahead 
 Ya leavin' the same way ya met me 
 You gon'be grievin if you sex me, while I'm schemin on the next piece 
 I'll poke ya cookie I don't give a fuck who know this 
 Who up in the area that aknowledge what a hoe is 
 All my warriors is lovin' my rep 
 How I took it to the world from the project steps 
 Playin' touch with my broad like my children 
 And it ain't like back in the days when we ducked behind buildings 
 I be a threat to tell a broad what I'm feeling 
 Especially if she poor and she need to be gettin' no bullshittin 
 She ever fix her mouth for some money it's good with me 
 I ain't the one what you need is a stool pigeon 
 (Chorus - Bun B sampled) 
 Go on and let a nigga peak, and let a nigga poke 
 Go on get naked for me streak, and let a nigga stroke (Repeat 4x) 
 (Verse 5 - Petey Pablo) 
 If you think I'm a treat a bitch with high price drawls 
 Any differance then the way I treat the grandma's on 
 How many ways is there to say that you terribly wrong 
 Would you understand me better if I just said "naw" 
 Fuck what another motherfucker told y'all 
 That's tipical talk when they dick hard 
 They just wanna little pussy mama that's all 
 It's like fourth down, two yards fuck it they goin' for it 
 How am I payin'for it?, and how much you charge for it? 
 It ain't about being a whore that's what it's made for 
 Get ya paper baby fuck what the world say 
 Get ya bills paid... okay! 
 (Chorus - Bun B Sampled) 
 Go on and let a nigga peak, and let a nigga poke 
 Go on get naked for me streak, and let a nigga stroke 
 (Petey Pablo talking)
