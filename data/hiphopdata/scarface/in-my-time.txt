It was a cold morning, gloomy, sun barely shining 
 Figured it was gon rain today, so I'm in 
 Sit around the house until the thunder storms slacks off 
 Look at my nightstand, and pick the paper back up 
 Nostradamus, I'm readin chapter, after chapter 
 Predictions of the end of world, and after 
 Life, wit no beginning, as the world stops spinning 
 ?As a journey that's never ending 
 I glance at my baby boy, I can see this in his eyes 
 The little nigga glad to be alive 
 And as the days go by, I thank god for watchin mines 
 Prayin' that I remained in fire 
 The same man that I was, which starts from the other mind phrase 
 Was it the cash I think my time came 
 For me to venture off into different demensions 
 The beginning, the endind, of my time 
 What we fail to realize 
 Is that we runnin' outta time 
 Do we ever be born again 
 In my time of dying 
 It's like I'm runnin' outta time 
 Will I ever be born again 
 In my time, I try to stay true steps on the game 
 And if you nigga's thinkin' like me, do the same 
 Which is one minute ya smilin', the next ya start cryin 
 'Cause we can't accept we born to die 
 And I, ease my edge, and be a nigga to the end 
 But it's more to life then me and my benz 
 When my mama told to speak to my friends 
 I kinda took that shit to heart 
 So don't fuck up your life, 'fore it starts 
 Some nigga's wanna be like Mike 
 I'd rather be like Christ (like Christ) 
 So at the end, I'll see bright lights (bright lights) 
 I save a prayer for the fallen soldier's 
 Too many nigga's died young, for tryna to hang 
 On the slaim's of our slums 
 And outcome, as mommy neals, sittin' on the front row 
 Hopin god will accept your soul 
 The new millienium, and as I sit watch the distance 
 Ships walk the horizon, I'll stare into space while I'm drivin' 
 And pray for me, all the ends of my sins 
 The beginning, the end, of my time, till I'm born again 
 In my time, I've seen life born, and I been blessed 
 Enough to see life lossed, it's just the price life cost 
 And shortly, explain my born, I know I'm born to do it wrong 
 So when I'm gone, life goes on 
 Tell my mother, when she on the front row, hold her head up 
 Shed no tears, and dred those years 
 Smile, and even though my whole life's been a po'ball 
 You did your's, and it's not your fault 
 Tell my grandmother those words too 
 She knows I'm headed to a better place 
 That'll put a smile on my wife's face 
 God's graced the evil spirit that surrounded me 
 And pass me, and anytime it could'a had me 
 But when it all went wrong, sung the same ol' song 
 Now it's peace after the storm blew on 
 And??, it's the better life, security for your's and mines 
 What the evil lies, and not so guide 
 In my time, it's been times, I would've stopped and called the quits 
 But I might as well sit until it's over wit 
 Eath to earth, and ashes to ashes, dust to dust 
 It's the lord I trust 
 The territory where I come from, so I guess it'll be when I return 
 No sorrow, it was just my turn 
 And in those, last trumphet sounds, put me down in the ground 
 But I'll proably be at home by now 
 And it's help will change (these helps will be changed) 
 Blinking of a eye, but I don't think I'll get to see that 
 In my time, till I'm born again 
 (Scarface talking) 
 It's changed, when we born 
 And how we born from woman 
 We born, from the spirit, of life 
 And all our flesh remains 
 And not, by the flesh of man 
 And not by the flesh of man 
 Do not believe that 
 (Chorus until fade)
