...Scarface ad libs... 
 ..."Let me spit some game to ya"... 
 You gotta war on drugs 
 Well every other day a nigga dies 
 You showed yours, now let me show you mine 
 Bring the six o'clock news 
 And let me walk 'em in my shoes 
 Through what you call the inner city 
 And what I call the blues 
 I'm broke here, and I ain't wainting on a call 
 From a restaurant to bust tables 
 When Petie's got a job 
 Making 35 a week and all he do is run the streets 
 This nigga always caked up 
 Chromed out and draped up 
 Constantly telling me we need to get this paper 
 I'm getting skinny and it's he who get my weight up 
 Straight up 
 And plus I'm tired of missing meals 
 So I paid the man a visit... 
 [Petie] "What's the goddamn deal? 
 It's good to see you dog 
 I thought you might've choked up 
 Respect and money, well I can get you both of 'em" 
 [Face] ...I went inside, watching him break it down 
 When he was finished he handed a nigga nine 
 A nine milimeter, nine zips 
 Said if I sold each one for nine, I'd have grip 
 I hesitated, I ain't never sold a stone 
 I done seen it fuck the hood up 
 Plus all my niggaz gone 
 And they ain't never coming out 
 So with that in consideration 
 I took the package and bounced 
 I'm headed home, dazing out in a zone 
 Eyes on my luggage, I'm abouts to get it on 
 Get to the house, spread it all on the couch 
 Getting this bank what it's about 
 That's how a nigga made 
 They got a nigga paid 
 I'm a muthafuckin' jacker not a slave 
 Get money everyday 
 It ain't no other way 
 That's how it is until they put me in a grave 
 I'm in the living room looking at the news 
 Got a razor and some zipper baggies 
 About to do the fool 
 Cutting hundred dollar slabs 
 Wholesaling niggaz halves 
 Getting money like a muthafucka 
 Serivng niggaz bags 
 Got the blocks all blowed up 
 The whole hood smoking 
 Got a pistol I ain't shot yet 
 So dude's wide open for it 
 I'm just a youngster, I ain't done it, but I will 
 'Cause I was taught you got to get it 
 So I get it how I live 
 Finna get my ma a crib, she ain't working 
 So I'm forced to win the bread for the household 
 'Cause dad was no support 
 Often in and out of court, caught a case out of town 
 Got a body on his conscience, but nobody made a sound 
 He was going through the motions 
 He gonna probably beat the case 
 Still I get down on my knees 
 And beg the Lord to let him raise 
 Get up and get my workers out 
 Supply 'em with the goods 
 Give instructions to the goons 
 To come up out the hood 
 I ain't gotta pay the fronters 
 So I'm finally finna raise 
 'Cause the bottom line is this homie 
 You gotta get paid 
 That's how a nigga made 
 They got a nigga paid 
 I'm a muthafuckin' jacker not a slave 
 Get money everyday 
 It ain't no other way 
 That's how it is until they put me in a grave 
 I never learned a trade 
 I fuck with chess and spades 
 The only other game a nigga learned to play was 
 Working hopping yay 
 'Cause kissing ass was gay 
 I'm on my business, I want money like I'm jade 
 I'm the nigga in the hood 
 These little homies wanna be like 
 I got when shit was good 
 But now-a-days off in this street life 
 These niggaz switch it on you 
 Quick to put you in the crosses 
 Now he standing in your crib 
 And got a pistol in your mouth 
 That's your muthafuckin' boy 
 He popped you and popped your broad 
 Now he headed to the closet 
 And he about to take it all 
 So watch your muthafuckin' friends 
 'Cause them the ones that sell you out 
 Ain't no future in being loyal 
 When niggaz see you want the top 
 Jealous hearted muthafuckas 
 Always quick to say you hating 
 I don't want another homie dog 
 He swallowed that and chased it 
 You can make it like I made it 
 I think it's best you do it dolo (solo) 
 That way niggaz can't say shit about you 
 When talking to the po-po 
 Oh yo, you know that dude that fronted me my come up 
 I caught him coming out the neighborhood 
 And had him done up 
 That's why I'm skeptic 
 When it comes to different faces 
 'Cause I know I got it coming 
 But till then, I'll get my bank, shit 
 (More ad libs) 
 ..."Fuck you think this is?"... 
 ..."More food for thought"... 
 ..."That's how this shit go 
 Muthafucka been foolin' you, fuckin' with you 
 All your muthafucking life 
 And he the muthafucka talking to the people 
 You know... get that nigga ass outta here"... 
 ..."I ride by my muthafucking self"... 
 ..."Look for me"...
