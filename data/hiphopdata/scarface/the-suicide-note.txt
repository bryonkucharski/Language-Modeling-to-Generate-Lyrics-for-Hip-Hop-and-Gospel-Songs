 I took my chances, but I did my dirt 
 And my adivce to any nigga if you crime, then you do the works 
 Its givin' up and step the fuck back 
 'Cause in this game you can fame 
 You gotta start dumpin these niggas off your nut-sack 
 I'm just a nigga out the hood tryna have thangs 
 When I got up on my feet and screamed the brand change 
 And your excuse was that the money did came 
 My excuse was that you was to blame 
 Simple ??, got to show my homies love tho 
 I just don't fuck around with niggas that I don't know 
 And you can take that how you wanna take it 
 I'm from these motherfuckin streets, 
 And the same rules apply in this game 
 You never break it 
 With my motherfucking luck, fallin' over the craps 
 And you niggas who wanna try to attack 
 We steady dyin' over dumb shit, And me I'm steady losin my sleep 
 'Cause niggas ain't familiar with the rules of the street, and it's a 
 Suicide, it's a Suicide 
 Suicide, it's a Suicide 
 It's a, Suicide, it's a Suicide 
 Suicide, it's a Suicide 
 (Scarface) 
 To my niggas on the street cryin then (watch them haters) 
 If I'm sittin' on the side-line (get your paper) 
 Too many niggas complaining pointin fingers at the problem 
 That's why I hate my baby momma 
 I'm just a nigga from the very bottom 
 Skippin classes, throwin' 8-balls into white powder 
 Tryna get it, while the motherfuckers gettin' good 
 Wit possibilities of gettin' out my neighborhood 
 Don't get me wrong, I had them dreams too 
 But the only thing you do, is get your cream too 
 Get your motherfucking cream fool 
 Niggas ain't know about the Ange and the Alicks 
 First you get in, then you get out, you stuck in this game 
 (Scarface) 
 Now when it's over don't nobody cry 
 Just enjoy while you live life, 'cause everybody got to die 
 When you see me I'll be hella high, beatin' corners wit my top down 
 Checkin' out the chasers in the sky, Shootin paper clips at Jupiter 
 The more I lie, it's like I'm gettin' stupider and stupider 
 Tryna make the best, out of a fucked up desicion 
 I'm just a nigga with a vision, which is to get up, get out 
 Gettin' my props, tryna stay away from these bitches that jock dick 
 And move enough to move on, gotta stay true to it 
 That's just the way you gotta do it 
 And these niggas here is really, dazed and don't give a fuck when you for real 
 And you like it rough, nigga what, the fuck 
 Know what I'm sayin' is real, now back the fuck up for you get killed 
 'Cause it's a... 
 Suicide
