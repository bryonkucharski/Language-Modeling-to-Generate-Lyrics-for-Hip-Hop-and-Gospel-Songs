Push it to the Limit, 
 Say watch to someone called Fred, 
 Sing all night and Dance on your head, 
 Push it to the Limit! 
 Oh Little Town of Derby, 
 There lived a fat bastard, 
 He was very round and lay around, and never went to the gym. 
 He was called Ridley, 
 And he was not a thin boy, 
 But everyone knew, that he was the embarrassing silences king. 
 As Soon as you walked in the joint, I could see you were a puff of distinction, 
 A real big bender! 
 Gay looking - too refined, 
 God - I'd hate to know what's gouing on in your mind. 
 So let me get right to the point, 
 Please don't pop yourcork for every guy you see! 
 Hay big bender, 
 Stay the fuck away from me. 
 Then this song ended with thiss...!
