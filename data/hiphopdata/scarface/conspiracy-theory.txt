 Lyrics for Song: Conspiracy Theory 
 Lyrics for Album: Jerusalem 
 What if I told you it was done with mirrors 
 What if I showed you it was all a lie 
 Better be careful, someone might hear ya 
 The walls have ears and the sky has eyes 
 What if I said you were only dreamin' 
 What you wanna bet that all you gotta do 
 Is open up your eyes and you will wake up screamin' 
 When you realize that it's all come true 
 Hush, now don't you believe it 
 Cover your head and close your eyes 
 Now, take it or leave it 
 Go back to bed 
 Now don't you cry 
 Half a million soldiers fly across the water 
 One in ten are never comin' back again 
 Fifty thousand sons who never grew to fathers 
 Don't you ever wonder who they might have been 
 What if you could've been there on that day in Dallas 
 What if you could wrestle back the hands of time 
 Maybe somethin' could've been done in Memphis 
 We wouldn't be livin' in a dream that's died 
 Go on and tell yourself again there are no secrets 
 Go on and tell yourself that you don't want to know 
 It's best that you believe that you don't hear the footsteps 
 That follow you around no matter where you go 
 Maybe you were thinkin' that it didn't matter 
 Maybe you believed nobody else would care 
 But once you've added every little lie together 
 You finally find the truth was always waiting there 
 Chorus (fades)
