 Call me psychotive but I'm bad, nigga yo! 
 And I'ma do ya bad, black 
 And when I come, I'm bustin' up niggas to hear me, black 
 Ya should have never let a nigga see 
 If there was niggas and bitches and bitches and niggas that hated me 
 Huh, I waited for my date to come-of-age 
 And now I'm of-age I can't escape the fuckin' front page 
 So I guess that nigga D is up to hit again 
 I kicks the funky shit and coke, and stupid like I'm Gilligan 
 I'm P, supposed to hit a lick for a jack 
 The only thing I gained is the pain of niggas comin' back 
 Nigga lookin' for they shit, aggravated and pissed 
 Niggas they can't fuck with my clique 
 I'm here to break 'em off for chunk 
 A D-E-A-T-H-L-Y, a motherfuckin punk 
 And I be rollin' with the brass 
 Don't answer with the ziggers in your hood, he break your neck to roll a 
 Pass, nigga 
 Don't even stop to say 'Whattup?' 'cause I bust for the fuck 
 And pay some quick to light a motherfucker up 
 Next time you stop me on your block, I hope you leave the place 
 Or be the next to meet the Lord face-to-face 
 Nigga, I ain't the one to take no bullshit 
 'Cause see a nigga like the D is game to empty out the full clip 
 So when I come for ya, act like ya know 
 Sittin' motherfuckin smooth to the curb but you don't hear do' 
 I'ma bring ya to ya asshole (uh) 
 Do it like the G-to-O (yeah) 
 Bustin' on that ass but still I see that you don't hear me do' 
 (But you don't hear me do') 
 Bring ya to ya asshole (uh) 
 Do it like the G-to-O (yeah) 
 Bustin' on that ass but still I see that you don't hear me do' 
 (DMG) 
 It's time to fuck 'em up, here it comes, BLAST, nigga! 
 Thump to your chest and they comin' out your ass, nigga 
 I grew apart, livin' my life as a criminal 
 Niggas G to kill but still I see that you don't hear me do' 
 So I'ma serve it to ya fat, hit the deck, mate 
 Hit the deck mate, call me Flipper when I checkmate 
 D-um divertin nine, Tre-9, full Glock, Glock 
 My Glock makin' sounds and it don't stop 
 So nigga pass the swisha quick 
 And I'ma blaze till the motherfucker burn me off my fingertips 
 'Cause, see a nigga gotta saty high 
 I try to smoke till I can't smoke and then I won't smoke 
 But still I got my fingers on my shit 
 And click, click, click, ya die, die, die, ya dead, bitch! 
 You tried to test the wrong nigga, be a tested 
 Straight from St.Paul but clockin G's down in Texas 
 Some think I'm talk 'cause I play it cool 
 But I ain't the average motherfucker, I do the shit that niggas won't do 
 Huh, like pistol whip a woodie for his bank 
 Then after that I gate and grab his bitch and do the same thang 
 And I will pain up the asshole 
 Collectin grips on my drips as I stroll but you don't hear me do' 
 (DMG) 
 Ain't no mistakin what I'm bringin', you motherfuckers still ain't had 
 Enough 
 So I'ma continue to break you off for proper ass chunk 
 May it be 9, may it be a gauge, may it be a shank 
 Any way you come I'm in your motherfuckin shit, mate! 
 Huh, a nigga bustin' caps, smokin' fires 
 Quick to bring it to your ass and keep on goin' till your ass die 
 And it ain't no runnin' down dem backstreets 
 'Cause I got slugs to catch 'em with Carl Lewis on the track meet 
 Huh, and still you wanna test a nigga so 
 Audi 5, nigga, hate to see ya go but you don't hear me do' 
 Yeah, check it!
