 Sunday morning I'm off at church 
 Sinnin' throughout the week, hustlin' every day 
 Gettin' it as we speak, listen to preacher preach 
 Choir singing the song, annie clapping her hands 
 Momma singing along, I'm impatient I wanna leave 
 Can't let my Momma see, I ain't listening to the word 
 Not like I don't believe, but I'm trippin' nobody perfect 
 To speak it wouldn't worth it for a person to be so Christ like 
 But I swear, I heard him cursin' 
 Let him without no sins cast the first stone 
 But I am so not him so let me go on on 
 Get home and he will find his hat on 
 Who's family when this all went on 
 Come on, let's see, some laughs, then we 
 Can do the same damn thing again next week 
 I love it when It happens like that 
 I smile 'cause it's not all bad 
 (G.I.) 
 You know they say that no one's perfect 
 That's why we struggle every day 
 Just know that every single day is a blessing 
 I'm just tryna find my way 
 I keep my head above water (keep my head above water) 
 Tell me what's the use of lookin' sad 
 Keep your head above water 
 Cause it ain't all bad 
 (Scarface) 
 Monday mornin' it's back to business 
 Cash the motivation, cops steady watchin' 
 Plottin' and waiting patient 
 Yeah I been thinkin' lately 
 Prayin' on even maybe 
 Probably best if I left it 
 The stress will drive you crazy if you let it 
 The penitentiary is where were headed 
 Designed for downfalls and some still don't get it 
 And yeah I might have said it way back and got sweated by 
 The same ones that hittin' it now but no credit came to me 
 If you can see the things I see 
 Then you could point your fingers at the blame not me 
 Ashamed how we can't stand one another 
 We hate the idea of a unified young brother so we suffer 
 But I adapt 'cause I'm a hustler 
 I still stay strapped with the muffler 
 I'm ten toes trapped in the struggle cause 
 I'm what the hood made motherfucker what 
 (G.I.) 
 You know they say that no one's perfect 
 That's why we struggle every day 
 Just know that every single day is a blessing 
 I'm just tryna find my way 
 I keep my head above water (keep my head above water) 
 Tell me what's the use of lookin' sad 
 Keep your head above water 
 Cause it ain't all bad 
 (Scarface) 
 As solid these niggas come, realist they ever made 
 Money is not important it's livin' it how you say 
 Picture back in the day, me moving a brick a week 
 Murdered you if I had to nigga I'm from the streets 
 And out here were playing for keeps, speak and your getting froze 
 Neck gettin' wrapped in sheets, sneakers will be exposed 
 This bullet here for your soul 
 Bitches is just for sex, that said I could jack my dick 
 She don't deserve respect, I'm knowin' my niggas feel it 
 Nothin' is fabricated authentic as I can say it 
 The only way I play it, this is for Curtis Davis 
 Mothers of fallen soldiers, Children of murdered fathers 
 Fathers out on the corners 
 Corners I'm standing on and I love 'em without a reason 
 Feelin' they aid the bleedin' they made me I'm never leavin' 
 Though the looks can look deceiving 
 Believe me y'all it might sound sad 
 But trust me dog it's not all bad 
 (G.I.) 
 You know they say that no one's perfect 
 That's why we struggle every day 
 Just know that every single day is a blessing 
 I'm just tryna find my way 
 I keep my head above water (keep my head above water) 
 Tell me what's the use of lookin' sad 
 Keep your head above water 
 Cause it ain't all bad
