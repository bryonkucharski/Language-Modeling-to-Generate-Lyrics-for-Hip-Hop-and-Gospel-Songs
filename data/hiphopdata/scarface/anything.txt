For a dolla' bill people will do anything 
 They'd rob and steal for a dolla' bill, any will 
 Let's go sit back and let the beat ride a lil' bit 
 Let a m.f hear what is supposed to sound like ya' dig 
 Yeah I'm from around the way, I slung about a oz a day 
 I'm living proof you ain't got no excuse 
 If it was there, it ain't got shit to lose 
 Dem' older cats would chunk a nigga fronts 
 Would rock it up and smoke that ish in blunts 
 For tennis shoes, we was getting' fools 
 We caught you slippin', we would get at you 
 With no respect, fu... a nigga set 
 We shot it up and murk his connects 
 What yours is mine for a dolla sign 
 I blame the grind, I was outta line 
 I'm reminiscing on what niggas did 
 For big rewards, you took a bigger risk 
 They say what comes around and go around 
 And when you least expect the ish be goin' down 
 Gotta' get it how I live, that's how the streets raised me 
 And for that paper most niggas do, anything, anything 
 A silent dude, so that's how a move I'm a street made nig 
 Not trying to lose, so I gotta do anything, anything 
 They called it murder in the first degree 
 And it was then that it occurred to me 
 This was some inside ish 
 That was your friend got hit huh 
 They knew all about the stash spot 
 Knew where the money was and cashed out 
 You got the nerve to act like you don't know 
 When all the while you steady gettin' mo' 
 Just remember dude we watchin' you 
 I spared your life they day they shot at you 
 'Cause if I didn't, they was coming back to finish off yo a 
 You a walkin' dead and it's a fact 
 You slimey niggas play the game wrong 
 Get popped, can't do they time so they sang songs 
 I turned the game on Watch the Nicks play 
 I sent them shottas at you're a 'cause u a b made nigga 
 Gotta' get it how I live, that's how the streets raised me 
 And for that paper most niggas do, anything, anything 
 A silent dude, so that's how a move I'm a street made nig 
 Not trying to lose, so I gotta do anything, anything 
 Real nigga in your presence 
 Money couldn't change me past or the present 
 Homey I'm the essence Tote a smith and western 
 Eyes hella tiny in the hood is where you find me 
 Out here with the grimey b wanna come up 
 Niggaa slangin'Snow packs, nose running from 'em 
 Let you get your mind right, money on that weed though 
 Baby on them molly whops blinded by the weed smoke 
 We come from them streets ho, I stay on that ignant' ish 
 Ain't nothing 'bout week ho 
 Always game to stomp a bi and stomp a bi... 
 And stomp a bi got super boxing' game 
 So I prefer to punch a bitch mission accomplished 
 Put me up against whatever I am busting it 
 A nucca's born hustlin' and tustlin and struggling and musclin' 
 Just making you aware who you fucking with
