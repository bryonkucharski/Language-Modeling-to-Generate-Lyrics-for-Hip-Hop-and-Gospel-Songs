(Feat. Johnny P., DMG and Lo-Ke) 
 Win... Lose... Draw... Die 
 Scarface: 
 I read the book of Revalations 
 And now I realize we in revalations 
 And on that note I make this statement 
 For all the young guns to become one to die young 
 Because the world is filled with hatred 
 And they aim to blame our sons 
 And I done seen down the barrel of a strap before 
 But I don't wanna die no mo', I fear the reaper 
 Help us Jesus, help to keep us away from all the sadness 
 And deliver us from the hate that cause the madness 
 I'm glad its installed in me from day one 
 Believe in something because most of my homies believe in nothing 
 And paying for it, God bless your souls, I'll be praying for it 
 Eventually you'll have your day in court 
 And I done been a witness to homocide 
 Seen a whole family die 
 Before the stones of diamonds in the sky 
 Through my bloodshot eyes feel the hurt and all the hate 
 That I've trapped inside because the hurtin' hard to ache 
 There's a smile on my face 
 But, that's to keep a man from crying 
 Cause deep down inside, I know I'm dying 
 I'm born for it, gon' take some time to getting used to 
 And Satan I know that your listening but I rebuke you 
 And refuse to let you capture me and kill my will 
 Just to survive the game of life, win or lose 
 Do or die, refuse to let you capture me to kill my will 
 To survive the game of life, win or lose, do or die 
 Chorus (Johnny P): 
 (2X) 
 Whether we win or lose this life to do or die 
 But sometimes we lose the will to win and wonder why 
 DMG: 
 Open my hands like a book 
 Years and years me and my notebook 
 I take a close look 
 Peep it dread see myself failing 
 A felon on the verge of 1-8-7 
 But I ain't ever wanna do it 
 'Cause homocide never solved it, 
 Just momentarily resolved it 
 We've all been involved in the calling of a loved one 
 Oldest ones the young ones the smartest one the dum-dums 
 And not begun with some 
 And they all probably died with none by the gun 
 That's on the one, two, three and the fo's for life 
 I slap five on the black hand side 
 I realize the future lies among my two sons and daughter 
 So I pray to God just for tomorrow 
 In lieu of the drama I move my momma 
 But the poverty's prolonging the pain 
 Plugging my arteries and veins with strains 
 When I lose in this game 
 Lo-Ke: 
 12/11/73, a young little huster was born 
 Torn from my momma's womb in the midst of the storm 
 Never warned I was going through a world of stress 
 Never knew that I was born for death, may God bless 
 My pops died when I was thirteen, I'm still tripping 
 Forget living, I'm on a suicidal mission 
 Tears dripping from my eyes as I look up at the sky 
 Asked the higher power why my old man had to die 
 It was hard to say goodbye I tried to hide what I feel 
 Forget the wife forget the will (naw, chill; naw, chill) 
 I'm at your gravesight, latenight trying to figure out 
 Would I see your smiling face if I commence to dig you out 
 I'm all about the cheese, I plan to see you once again 
 But I can't make through the night without committing a sin 
 I had to realize there wasn't no friends, backstabbin 
 I had to watch my own back while I was out mashin' 
 Closed caption for the hearing impaired 
 Have you ever seen your closest homey laid out buried and dead? 
 I shed a tear even though I'm not supposed to cry 
 I can't lie I ain't ready to die, I ain't ready
