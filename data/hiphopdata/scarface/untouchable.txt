Its on and once again I come to you wit rough shit 
 Game to bust shit when mutha fuckers wanna fuck wit 
 The mastermind will bring it once I seen it in light 
 Awaken by the sounds of niggas screamin' at night 
 Cover your eyes I leave you face to face with your maker 
 The time taker intend your mind so now I break ya 
 No runnin' from it you should've ran before I done it 
 Cause now I got this loaded twelve gage against your stomach 
 You scarred for life and your whole high life's invited 
 Burned alive it's all for real so tonight I ignite 
 And leave you all face down to die 
 With no will to live I can see the fear in your eyes 
 No warning surprise nigga I come for taking 
 Your soul for Satan watching' every move that your making 
 Your sure mistaken if you a ho before I turn out 
 Walking away I'll heat you up and leave you burnt out-nigga 
 I'm hard to kill 'cause I refuse to die 
 And can't no man born of woman alive kill me 
 I'm Untouchable 
 Un-touch a-ble out here baby 
 (I'm untouchable) 
 Un-touch a-ble out here baby 
 (I'm unfuckable) 
 Un-touch a-ble out here baby 
 Un-touch a-ble out here baby 
 It's danger I'm standin' in the footsteps of danger 
 Wit a loaded Mac 11 stripped wit rips in the chamber 
 The anger I aim the barrel of the hanger 
 Deep into the mind of this mutha fuckin' stranger 
 I change ya outlook on living and I leave ya 
 Frozen starin' into space shakin' seizuring 
 I told ya the southside niggas roll deep 
 I showed ya the northside niggas don't sleep 
 Ya beat I'm coming down shootin up your section 
 You are now witnessing the gangster shit pure perfection 
 I'm old school O.G. niggas know me 
 From slanging' eightballs uncooked to moving whole keys 
 Now why these niggas wanna test my skills 
 I'm a killa and I chastise steel 
 To mix and mingle with this millionaire status 
 And send a mutha fucker to hell when he fuck with Brad-it's 
 The killer instinct that never left me 
 The southside still true to the game little lefty is back 
 Wit shit that mutha fuckers can't fade 
 Rhyming but still you mutha fuckers ain't paid 
 So how can one try to see the unseen 
 Before you step your ass to the square know one thing 
 It's closed curtain we leavin' mutha fuckers hurtin' 
 It's Rap-a-Lot Mafia life we all workin' 
 Punk we shut you down before you get it started 
 You can hate it but I'm goin' get mines and that's regardless- bitch 
 I got these niggas boo-hooin' like hoes 
 Jealous of the game I obtain and I chose 
 To exercise to the best of my ability 
 It ain't no mutha fuckin' kill me 
 I'm Untouchable 
 Un-touch a-ble out here baby 
 (I'm untouchable) 
 Un-touch a-ble out here baby 
 Un-touch a-ble out here baby 
 (Unfuckable) 
 Un-touch a-ble out here baby
