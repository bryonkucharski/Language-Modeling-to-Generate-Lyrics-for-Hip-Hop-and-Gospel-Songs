I got a problem how you do that there 
 It's been thirteen years and ain't went nowhere 
 Still, one of the coldest ever done this shit 
 And ain't no motherfucking question know who run this bitch 
 I got my nigga Erick Sermon he supplied the beat 
 And I be in the vocal booth, supply the heat 
 Up in the game, for the street, these blocks and thugs 
 With a pistol grip shotgun to box someone 
 And it's a thin red line between what was and ain't 
 Got a $50 sack, plus I love to drink 
 I be in southside nigga till it's said and done 
 And I was always taught to take the bread and run 
 Here it is, the motherfucking moment of truth 
 I came in one deep now what you hoes wanna do 
 All these Rolex watches 
 It ain't shit to me 
 And the Cristal poppin' 
 It ain't shit to me 
 Bitches out boppin 
 Ain't shit to me 
 It ain't shit to me, ain't shit to me 
 Man, hold up, got too much bleek in my truck 
 I silence niggas like gag orders 
 With motherfucking powderpuff I just add water 
 I blow you punk bitches out the frame 
 And I'ma make you hoes remember my name 
 I'm the J E S S E, J A M E S 
 I'm shuttin niggas down, H town is mine I bet you know now 
 So hush with the talk, talk 
 Claimin you gon' put it on the map 
 Well I done already done that 
 So follow in footsteps of the gangsta shit's finest 
 Since 1987, Mr. Scarface 
 Gosh, I'ma stop you at the moment of truth 
 The last man standin, now what you wanna do 
 So you got tight flows 
 It ain't shit to me 
 Money, hoes 
 It ain't shit to me 
 Brand new clothes 
 It ain't shit to me 
 Yeah right, see this Ro 
 It ain't shit to me 
 Finna get a record deal 
 It ain't shit to me 
 Build a house on the hill 
 It ain't shit to me 
 Brand new Benz, big wheels 
 It ain't shit to me, ain't shit to me, it ain't shit to me 
 Now the moral of this story here is simple and plain 
 Next time you mention southern rap remember the name 
 All you magazine niggas gettin' caught up in the new shit 
 Just remember what the truth is 
 My mind playin' tricks on me, Scarface is back 
 Diary of a man made, nigga comin' agg' 
 The wall, the dead, lettin niggas know I ain't a prankster 
 Damn it feels good to be a gangster 
 Smile for me now, I see the man died today, my fuel 
 I'm still up in this bitch, what they wanna do 
 Ay, ay 
 It ain't shit to me 
 All that talk it ain't shit to me 
 Big money ain't shit to me 
 It ain't shit to me 
 Publishing 
 Ain't shit to me 
 Management deals ain't shit to me 
 Money, cars, jewelry 
 Ain't shit to me, ain't shit to me
