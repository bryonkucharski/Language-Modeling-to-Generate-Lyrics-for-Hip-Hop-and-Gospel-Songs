My ghetto dreams always turn to ghetto nightmares 
 At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn 
 Candlesticks in the dark, I was whippin' the hard 
 I was gettin' the broads that like "who the hell is that" 
 I was dealing sacks, you looking at niggas that drove to hell and back. 
 Charismatic I was raised by a addict with money in the attic. 
 Got goons while you at it at 
 This present time I'm out of my mind and that's a habit, 
 Still got them waiting in line they gotta have 
 Last night was the first night I got sleep 
 Tossing and turning for two or three weeks 
 My nightmares are triggered by bad memories 
 Lord, send me an angel right now while I'm having ghetto dreams 
 Cold sweats listenin' to the old sweat 
 One, two that's a ho check 
 Now for real, nigga this a whole check 
 Just bossin' around, polo sweats 
 Used to dream 'bout a bigger couch 
 Woke up in a bigger house, come on 
 Commas in my bank account 
 So much money I had to let the banker count 
 It's like the world stand still 
 Yesterday your little man got killed 
 And all he ever wanted was a bank roll 
 But he died too young 'cause the game's cold 
 Most niggas ain't know, or they just think slow 
 Once you get in you gotta leave but you can't though 
 Does freedom make a motherfucker evil 
 To the point down your ass when he see you 
 Let's take that needle, fill it with poison 
 Inject the ghetto with the drug, paranoia 
 Got you lookin' at your homeboy sideways 
 Ain't no honor among thieves is there nowadays 
 They tell me crime pays, but I don't think so 
 Because every criminal I know is in the clink, yo 
 A nigga in the game right now 
 Must be working for them people cause that shit played out 
 I lay awake in my four corner room with the candles
