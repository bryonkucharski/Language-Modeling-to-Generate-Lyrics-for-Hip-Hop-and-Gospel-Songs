(Verse: Scarface) 
 Young Face slangin, Ya Ya Ya 
 Heavyweight, Got a bad bitch in every state 
 On the grind, nonstop till I touch this cake 
 Mark ass niggas, stay the fuck up out my way 
 I be true O.G., you can quote what I say 
 I'm a H-town nigga from around the way 
 Southside, ridin' dirty like I'm UGK 
 Asshole by nature like my name was Tre 
 And I don't gangbang, I control the Game 
 What I'm representin' here's puttin' holes in brains 
 Oh, I say the same thing till I'm old and grey 
 For I falloff and rap about my clothes and chains 
 Grippin' grain and poppin' trunks, Dawg that ain't me 
 These elbows hit the scene back in '83 
 I stay street with it, dun asked that 
 You can find me in your hood pumpin' monster crack 
 I rollover rodents with rims on em 
 Sniffing out a rat, I expose them and then bend on em 
 I lotta bitches but they claiming they O.G.s 
 A straight up pussy, he claims he knows me 
 See I puttin' out these VVdees 
 Let my shit hit the streets, he got to squat to pee 
 Got them eggs on these beams, so they watchin' me 
 Might trap for a rat, pussy watch and see 
 I been straight for a long time 
 Gettin' checks for a long time 
 Gettin' Jake for a long time 
 E&J for a long time 
 Nigga, try to get like me 
 Been a G, for a long time 
 Been in the streets, for a long time 
 Toting heat, for a long time 
 Nigga, try to get like me 
 I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status 
 I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status 
 I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status 
 I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status 
 I came here to exercise my game 
 Swear love to the hood 
 That's how I do my thang 
 Smoke weed with my hommies 
 Bar-b-q them wangs 
 Sip hennisy and coke 
 See I don't fuck with drank 
 Hold out bill ski 
 Because that shit ain't cool 
 We just drunk a mad dog before we went to school 
 Way up back then I was smashing boys 
 Jump wrong you saw a nigga get his ass destroyed 
 Same shit right now 
 I demand respect 
 And if I slap one hoe than a man was next 
 I'm kick door robber 
 A hot shot driver 
 A crack rock slanging mother fucker for a dollar 
 If there's shit there to be made 
 Then I'm finna make it 
 But if ther ain't no way 
 Than I'm believe take it 
 Cause a nigga with no hustle is his worth is (gay?) 
 And a bitch like this is even worse then that 
 I'm a fool bullshiting what this game can cost 
 And if a nigga can't maintain than man he's lost 
 Being heard and they fuck nerds in jail I heard 
 And as a nigga I come in here with my balls word 
 I been straight for a long time 
 Gettin' checks for a long time 
 Gettin' Jake for a long time 
 E&J for a long time 
 Nigga, try to get like me 
 Been a G, for a long time 
 Been in the streets, for a long time 
 Toting heat, for a long time 
 Nigga, try to get like me 
 I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status 
 I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status 
 I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status 
 I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status 
 Man on second thought the story is about boys 
 Running round talking bout how they ride these cars 
 I was sitting in these Benz at the age of 19 
 When I was 21 I had a yellow ferrari 
 22 I was portioned with a top at back 
 23 in a rose with the pipe to match 
 24 I wasn't tripping what I came up in 
 I was focussing on how to be like james back then 
 Wonder how respected was the life I chose 
 Being famous wasn't nothing I just liked my dough 
 I was living in the fast lane 
 Man for sho 
 Short temper quick to up let this thing unload 
 So if I had a problem with ya 
 Use a blanket no 
 Shaw the message then you see the nigga's brain exploads 
 So if you see a nigga chunk da doose as you see me ride by 
 I been straight for a long time 
 Gettin' checks for a long time 
 Gettin' Jake for a long time 
 E&J for a long time 
 Nigga, try to get like me 
 Been a G, for a long time 
 Been in the streets, for a long time 
 Toting heat, for a long time 
 Nigga, try to get like me 
 I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status 
 I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status 
 I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status 
 I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status
