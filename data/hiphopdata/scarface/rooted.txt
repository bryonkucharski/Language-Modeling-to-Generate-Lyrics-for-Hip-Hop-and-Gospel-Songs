You win some, you lose some, life in a nutshell 
 Free all my niggas on locked down, fuck jail 
 I've seen enough hell to never wanna live there 
 Tattooed teardrops, sitting in a wheelchair 
 Kids on the streets doing bad, momma moved out 
 Dopeman pushing on the corner where the schoolhouse sits 
 This is bullshit, this can't be life 
 I can't blame it on the hood 'cause it gave me life 
 This a stick-up, don't turn it to a 187 
 I don't go to church so I'm far from a Reverend 
 Ain't nothing like a young nigga, armed with an AK 
 Walking up the sidewalk, shooting in the broad day 
 Fuck what a broad say, I'm all day villain 
 I'm getting money so I'm always chilling 
 And even though they say I'm killing all they children 
 I'm just a nigga hustling for my million dollars 
 (Papa Rue) 
 You know I stay rooted 
 I stay rooted 
 I and I stay rooted 
 Crooked officer, crooked officer 
 I stay rooted (beh!) 
 I and I stay rooted 
 Now if I had to play Jack, I'll be leaving you bad news 
 Everybody in here be bound and gagged too 
 I'm postin' at your crib nigga hurry yo ass home' 
 You was out here hi-capping and all yo stash gone 
 The money met the work and that's a real life no-no 
 It don't take a bunch of niggas, just me solo 
 I go for dolo, I can't tell on myself 
 Immature ass niggas get you sentenced to death 
 Loud talking in the tank like he a stoned cold killer 
 And you fighting a murder charge, my nigga? 
 The moral of the story is keeping your mouth shut 
 'Cause everybody is listening, speaking you fucked up 
 I tell you like them old cats say: get what you get and get your ass out the way 
 'Cause greed'll get you 35 type, you're 27, that's the rest of your fucking life 
 (Papa Rue (Scarface)) 
 [You know I stay rooted 
 I stay rooted] 
 I and I stay rooted 
 Crooked officer, crooked officer 
 I stay rooted (beh!) 
 I and I stay rooted 
 (It's in my DNA, my blood type G, my roots is deep up in these motherfucking streets) 
 Real recognize what's real, the bullshit see through 
 The way I spit it, ain't another one that's equal 
 This for my people in the game ten toes, rooted in the streets, and withholding info 
 We got secrets we gone take to the grave 
 We don't honor nothing else, except the rules of getting paid 
 And no wonder why a motherfucker hustling dope 
 Everything we doing legal equal leaving us broke 
 What I hope is that a nigga don't forget where he from 
 And turn his back on his hood 'cause he's seeing some crumbs 
 And no money in the world that's enough to respect, when somebody take a gun and put it up to your chest 
 Saying 'fuck it' at the same time he squeezing a round 
 You can blame it on your homeboy for keeping you down 
 If it was me, I'd be leery of the people I meet, 'cause in this motherfucking game niggas playing for keeps 
 (Papa Rue) 
 You know I stay rooted 
 I stay rooted 
 I and I stay rooted 
 Crooked officer, crooked officer 
 I stay rooted (beh!)
