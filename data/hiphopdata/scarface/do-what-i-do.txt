(Scarface) 
 I am ghetto, boy, chillin' 
 Represent for the niggas in the hood and how they livin' 
 Heavy metal concealin' 
 Hustlin' till you touch a 9 to 5 of drug dealin' 
 It don't matter how I get it, I got it, fuck feelings 
 I don't have none, I'm 'bout my paper, nigga, ask 'em 
 Don't get confused on how the cash come 
 Never, by any means necessary better 
 Get up off your ass and get my money 'fore I stretch yah 
 Out in front your doorstep, when I brandish this .45th 
 You can make arrangements, you a dead man, a ghost 
 See I come from them cuts for real 
 Much long before this rap came, fuck the deal 
 I survived the game of life, nigga, fuck some skills 
 Crossin' me, get in the way, this pussy must get killed 
 I'm alive, he came, he bust till he left 
 I would have made for sure I was dead and fuck yourself 
 Yeah, cause now I'm at his ass with a vengeance 
 Blood in, blood out from the beginning to the ending 
 Real shit bein' spit, know your limits 
 It's best you mind your motherfuckin' business 
 If you ain't in it 
 (Z-Ro) 
 So hard in these streets 
 Gotta pack a pistol plus talk to God in these streets 
 Go to church, Sunday, Monday, sellin' raw in these streets 
 Never took it home though, I left it all in these streets 
 Gotta do what I gotta do 
 I ain't promotin', no, eviction notice on the door 
 Fuck it, I had to go for broke 
 Do what I gotta do 
 Hustle till I see the dirt 
 Riskin' 25 years just to see another first 
 (Rick Ross) 
 I was all alone, car full of niggas 
 How'd I get here? Car full of hittas 
 I was rollin' weed, they was snortin' blow 
 Such a cool breeze, heart so cold 
 Step up to the plate, where your money at? 
 Bobby Brown on cake with a hundred packs 
 New editions, Lisa Lisa 
 We were secret lovers, had to get a beeper 
 My Atlantic star, not a Notre Dame 
 Not a student loan, tried to motivate 
 Continental, my Bentley, this shit should be illegal 
 Selassie eye in the ghost, thousand bales of that diesel 
 Lord, go toe to toe with any pussy boy 
 Fuck, one time for Face and all the Boobie boys 
 26 inch plates on a 68 
 Where I'm from a half a key'll set a nigga straight 
 I just wanna make the car notes 
 Let mama make the pot roast 
 You should meet me at the car wash 
 Washin' all 8, that's inshallah 
 (Z-Ro) 
 So hard in these streets 
 Gotta pack a pistol plus talk to God in these streets

 Never took it home though, I left it all in these streets 
 Gotta do what I gotta do 
 I ain't promotin' no eviction notice on the door 
 Fuck it, I had to go for broke 
 Do what I gotta do 
 Hustle till I see the dirt 
 Riskin' 25 years just to see another verse 
 (Nas) 
 Speakin' for those squeakin' in them cell blocks readin' 
 To blacks, whites and Puerto Ricans 
 Brothers with those ankle bracelets, impatient for their releasin' 
 To make it back to the block, the hatred, the present 
 Time sure flies, look how many years went by 
 My young niggas already need hair dye 
 Alcoholic faces, women bad as a mug 
 Gettin' fat as fuck 
 Fried food be addin' up, the system thrives off its victims 
 They ask how this economic collapse 
 Can affect people all over the map 
 Tea party for tax reenactment is whack 
 The past the past, yo, to my vatos out in the East Los 
 Nietas on the east coast, shouts to Puerto Rico 
 Dominican Republic people, rep I 
 Brown and black, we must get it together 
 The prison industrial complex a fuckin' set up 
 The Aztec, Olmec, African settled on this land from the get up 
 I changed my aim, who I'm gon' wet up 
 When violence is resorted, knowledge is distorted 
 Unless it's payback for brutality 
 I'm more or less with that, get back 
 (Z-Ro) 
 So hard in these streets 
 Gotta pack a pistol plus talk to God in these streets

 Gotta do what I gotta do 
 I ain't promotin' no eviction notice on the door 
 Fuck it, I had to go for broke 
 Do what I gotta do 
 Hustle till I see the dirt
