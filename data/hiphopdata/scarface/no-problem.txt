Greatest ever done it, you can learn from it 
 Dope game; ran it - rap game; run it 
 Street cred hundred, nerd turned D-boy 
 Naughty genetic make-up, baby, I'm a G-boy 
 Hashtag street-boy, wrong one to fuck with 
 Cross me at your own risk, play to get back, you can trust this 
 I am far from average, to me it ain't no such thing 
 Me against the world so fuck it I let my nuts hang 
 I've been known to bust bang, Kíli of the NEB 
 I don't need an army when the smoke clears, he sees me 
 Rhyming at its finest unlike those vaginas 
 They claim that they the real deal knowing I'm the highest 
 Time for the command chain, I am what the streets made 
 I am what the hood built, you are just a weakling 
 Homocidal maniac with suicidal tendencies 
 You're more like a punk band, I'm more like a pedigree 
 Nigga, you ain't seen yet so y'all can not describe me 
 I'm a freak of nature, Don't shit here surprise me 
 Money over everything except a nigga's manhood 
 I am not a prostitute, you don't understand hood 
 Fuck a nigga getting his unless he 'bout to give me mine 
 Otherwise he prime beef, shocking when I up the nine 
 And hit him with it several times, fuck you thought I was civilized? 
 Welcome to the jungle, fool, it's only right I punish you 
 Nigga with an attitude, feel like MC Ren felt 
 Quiet on the set, you funky bitch, you get your friend slept 
 I'll give your gang a black eye, blame it on the black God 
 I be on some nigga shit, I'm nigga rich so that's why 
 Guess what my religion is, this is what the business is 
 Expose you for your garbage ass rappers, you can witness this 
 Came to bang the game up, pussies think they came up 
 Oh, you got a drophead? So now you think you're famous? 
 Out here it's dangerous, if we don't know your name 'cause 
 We don't even give a fuck, rappers get it fucked up 
 Security save you? Nah, it's their side job 
 They don't want no conflict, they don't want no problem 
 Nah
