 I hope metafy you with peace and all hustling

 'Cause you're my niggas on tha realer 
 Beground these streets for stacking peeler 
 For the dealers, save back on your teams 
 And underrestamate with these who do 
 You get the paper and then get of the street 
 Y'all remember, you'll never give the money and the dope to me 
 'Cause I won't give a shee to a nigga starvin 
 So we can fluss and blow weed hangin' with the warden 
 How many niggas on the quad who don't giva a fuck 
 Survivin struggls hiting licks out the hippieclub 
 I'm just a homie out the hood who did something 
 So why are you fronting

 You heard me homie! 
 Or do you try to tell it to the dumdums 
 They call you niggas 
 And niggas try steel were they come from 
 I bring the front to all my homies out riding 
 Help a homie get on his feet, and we'll all riding 
 Sange, and fange in this game, but it's true 
 Be sure that you'll respecting the power, and that's you 
 Never forget the neighbourhood were it started 
 The ghette south eight is my hood and my hearts with the...

 Millennium muthafucka and kay-doo were ya at

 Cause muthafuckas being talkin' for so long 
 But now I'm down with the innerface clik and it's on 
 Give a fuck were you're from nigga 
 And kay-doo always represtentin 
 That nigga is a fact I've lived in it 
 Now look at me, y'all can't steel rabbit 
 For all y'all niggas talking that shit, I'm still strapping 
 Will I strapp ya? 
 Niggas with all that hot capit 
 Niggas packin' in fake and it ain't happning 
 Will you think we're smacking 
 That yellow road is steady packing 
 The home of the ghetto slangin 
 And car jacking 
 Nigga, I ain't acting 
 I was brought up in this bitch 
 From the O.P's and all down to the eastwike 
 Even flat joe's and even the lingwood is all hood 
 For the Christ your all driving is all hood 
 The ghetto

 Ice Cube: 
 I got give it up to my ghetto niggas 
 In the ghetto, bitch, looking forthem ghetto licks 
 Geting ghetto rich 
 Knowing that the steam in the book flip the gang 
 Quick to get my telephone turned on in my mama's name 
 This ghetto slang is some shit thatcan beat collage, 
 You ain't fucking with this hustla with street knolledge 
 9 to 5 
 Still fliping twenties on the side 
 Try to get by the feints 
 I'm making dollars out of fifty cents 
 Got the big body benz, with the wheels on it 
 A celuarphone with no bills on it 
 Get your ass on this, got to fill on, still want it 
 Baby, leen on it, and I can put the kill on it 
 You gotot strap a nigga lie like a singer 
 Puting your baby to sleep 
 And turn of your ring and you can catch me on banewick 
 Looking sick in a six 
 And some schweiz on my wrist 
 Now picture this 
 You got to blow, cause to many niggas out for mr. Jackson's dope 
 Y'all niggas got to go, to the ghetto 
 Ghetto, 
 Ghetto. 
 I can't get out of here 
 Ghetto 
 Nigga 
 Ghetto

 Willie D 
 Deathwall is the site 
 When the mic be light 
 As twice as shipp advice to my homies who write me in te pine 
 Now the sale is hell but kids keep sending me mail 
 With their laberty bell, so I can tell you about the half 
 And who got cow for riches, and sending bithces, 
 I'm making bitches 
 I remember when I just to get beat with extensioncars 
 And we slanged by to see were my house was 
 Started stealing out of my mama's perce 
 Now that she's gone 
 She lives thrue my songs 
 And it sure hurts 
 I couldn't have treated her worse then in the ghetto 
 And turn our womens into wideows 
 Sick to see my homie that I ain't with, trade with, paid with, laughed with 
 Dead in a casket. 
 To my pumps we can reach the top 
 But you got a chance to get of the pop 
 If you see your chance baby take it 
 I was the last mothafucka in the world who thoiught I would make it 
 But look at me now, a six on the beach in greeze 
 Check from the muthafucka stretts of the ghetto 
 Ghetto, 
 Ghetto. 
 I can't get out of here 
 Ghetto 
 Nigga 
 Ghetto 
 I can't get out of here
