(Slim Thug][Hook: x 2) 
 When I hit the club all the girls show me love 
 While I'm at the bar, got drank by the jug 
 In the v.i.p with the chicks and the drugs 
 It's the T.I.P, Bun-be and Slim Thug 
 (Slim Thug] [Verse 1) 
 I got drank by the pint 
 Dro by the pound 
 Headed to the club in the boss top down 
 Slim Thug bout to clown represent H-town 
 If you love me you gon smile 
 If you hate me you gon frown 
 Cause me and my bosshoggs bout to ball till we fall 
 This year, I won't stall, Slim Thugga want it all 
 Goin' solo, first CD out that nots slow-mo 
 Here's another hit thanks to the drank and they do-do 
 Fa sho though we got the club shut down 
 Tryna pick which chick Ima cut now 
 Got a fetish for thick girls that's caramel brown 
 On a hunt and uggh guess what I just found
