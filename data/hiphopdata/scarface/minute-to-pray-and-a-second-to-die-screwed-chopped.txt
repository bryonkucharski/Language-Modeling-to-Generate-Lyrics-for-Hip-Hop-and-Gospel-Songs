Life goes on in the streets of my hood when you die 
 But some cry, and gets by, while others choose to wonder why... 
 His life was took at such an early age 
 A young nigga who lived in a rage died by the gauge 
 He used to hustle on the street corners 
 His mom would always beg him to quit, but he didn't wanna 
 As he got older, he got even worse 
 Till a real nigga showed him the purpose of a hearse 
 A cold night in his hood, he had a tangle 
 The brother he was squabbling with, had broke his ankle 
 Laid him out in the driveway 
 Some people knew he wouldn't survive, but hey 
 I ain't the one to speak up on another's 
 All I can do is try to open his eyes and help the brother 
 He chose the wrong way and that's the route he took 
 Born and brought up as an angel but he died as a crook 
 He had a baby that he couldn't raise 
 And she will never see her father again, 'cause he's in a grave 
 I always think about it killer 
 "My daddy was a dope man, so I'ma be a dope dealer" 
 How will the family explain it? 
 "My daughter had a baby for a 'caine head!" 
 He ain't around to see her walk 
 Dry her eyes when she cries, pick her up when she falls 
 Just the thought of a kid living foul fucks me up 
 When his girl has to raise a BASTARD child 
 It gets deeper, he used to punch her and beat her 
 She was loyal to his ass but accused as a cheater 
 She had a good deck but she picked the wrong card 
 Had a kid, now she's realizing life is hard 
 A big time dope dealer's all she wanted 
 Who drove a Jag or a Benz so she could flaunt it 
 The situation's got me guessing 
 But the answer remains to be a question 
 He lived his life in a lie 
 I guess you only get a minute to pray, and a second to die 
 It was crazy how it happened 
 Some niggas rolled by in the Riviera capping 
 All I could see was a pistol spitting rounds 
 And the boy was just screaming as he fell to the ground 
 A woman yelled, get an ambulance 
 But I knew he was dead, he didn't stand a chance 
 You should've seen him, he was scared 
 A bullet goes to his chest, and one to his head 
 He just laid there in silence 
 And all I heard was the sirens 
 Paramedics pulled up 
 Followed by a law man and then came a firetruck 
 Put his ass on the stretcher 
 But if he survives, I'm willing to betcha 
 He'll be out for revenge 
 They patched him up within a week he was back at it again 
 Went to his brother on the Northside 
 Grab your shit, it's a hit, we're gonna take a long ride 
 Packed it up in the trunk 
 AK-47, M-11 and a pump 
 Rolled by ? on Scott Street 
 School was letting out, 
 "Yo you ain't gonna shoot yet?" "watch me!" 
 Opened his trunk and grabbed a shotgun 
 He shot him 
 Put his tooly on the front seat 
 Continued his mission, as he headed down the street 
 The kids was just staring at each other 
 J.D. rolled by and smoked black's brother 
 Reached in his coat and grabbed a 'port 
 Full speed down Reed, shot his mom on the porch 
 On his way down Cullard 
 His brother was just dazed in a shock, "Why you do it?" 
 "Why you shot his moms Jay? Shit" 
 "Haha man fuck that bitch" 
 Went to the store to use the payphone 
 Called up Mack, "Hey yo J.D. homey" 
 Hung it up and rolled down Dagger 
 Heading for the nigga he was after 
 By the time he arrived at the scene 
 Malcolm was ready for anything 
 He tried to sneak around the back way 
 Never thought of being taken out on that day 
 Black boy, black coat 
 Stood around the corner as he passed slit his throat 
 He didn't fall so he fired 
 One to the middle of his skull, he's expired 
 A whole army came out 
 Twenty-seven niggas all strapped out of one house 
 That how it happens in the acre 
 One nigga died in the park in the paper 
 Shit gets deeper but why? 
 I guess you only get a minute to pray, 
 And a second to die
