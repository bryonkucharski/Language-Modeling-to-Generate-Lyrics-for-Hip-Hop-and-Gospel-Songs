 Nigga I ain't starvin, I'm the dope man 
 Got no fam, I'm heartless as they make dudes, I'm programmed 
 These niggas out here flashin, that's a no-no 
 I'm cut from that old law, We don't talk to Popo's 
 A killer out my door-door, you peaked in 
 Solo when I did dirt, bar none of y'all, I'm seasoned 
 Go dumb-dumb if they forcin' me to squeezin' 
 I don't hesistate 'cause I know I can keep a secret, nigga

 Set up on my corner with my 50 pack 
 Sold it rock for rock, and then I double back 
 Moved around the corner, had them niggas pumped 
 Every other day, I scored another hump 
 Ounces, nigga, ounces up on ounces, nigga 
 Bitch, you out here frontin, you's a bouncer, nigga 
 Hangin' in that club, talkin' loud and shit 
 Bump that 45, and got you out of this 
 Ever seen a nigga with that pistol out? 
 Walk up in your house and stick it in your mouth 
 Dope man, nigga, fuck you talkin' bout 
 Shoot yo ass twice, and then I'm walkin' out
