She steady tellin' me her dude ain't the type she like 
 And the reason she ain't leavin' is 'cause "he's so nice" 
 On Due to special occasions like birthday shit 
 That's election just in need for some birthday dick 
 You can spend it with your man y'all can walk them malls 
 Tear that motherfucker down I just want your draws 
 That's why I'm laughing every time you call 
 'Cause I know that you're in love with how I broke it off 
 The nigga strokes too soft and she a beast in bed 
 And when she fucks she talks pussy is deep and wet 
 And I don't need the taxes I don't sweat the bitch 
 And sworn and damn and that's some Texas shit 
 And I won't fuck's 'em on the first day, I peeps they mind 
 So they know that what they havin' more important than mine 
 And when I'm deep inside with speed devine 
 I'm movin grown she screamin hard, which means that I'm... 
 (Chrous: (girl screamin in the background)) 
 Makin' you hit the high notes (she hittin' the high note) 
 Makin' you hit the high notes (hey you hittin' the high note baby) 
 Makin' you hit the high notes 
 (I can makin' you hit the high note) 
 From doing daily at the movies going out the broads 
 Make you look like you're a couple when it's not at all 
 How it is in actualities you close your mouth 
 We do better gettin' tracin' down important talk 
 Understands that you got a man is probably not 
 In the end is something both is something seasons out 
 And even if we are just friends that don't justify 
 You being seeing with a boy like him 
 'Cause boy that's bad and they know before it's over 
 You be bend over my sofa while I bust that ass 
 And while that nigga takin' pictures of you behind your clothes 
 Sendin' roses to your office while he's crying and soars 
 Stuck wonder while you leavin' mouth in the cloth 
 She's floppin' with your business what somebody been told 
 She was probably a hoe, probably somebody you know 
 On your cell phone dial while you hittin' that note 
 Now we squeezin it for... 
 If she a hoe in the beginning she's a hoe for life 
 And I can't understand how niggaz make these hoes they wife 
 You got hoes that's filipino you got hoes that's white 
 You got hoes from Puerto Rico that's just cold as ice 
 And it is what it is ain't no changin' the facts 
 It was a shame when you only thought they came in black 
 Now how insane is that, had a change of heart 
 Though you have a worth then it came a pork 
 Then she hangs with boys you need to tell your broad 
 Said until she met him she never came this hard 
 And the shamest part while you at home relax 
 I make her eyes, I try to brake her motherfuckin back 
 On the balcony bend over lookin' bad as hell 
 Finger fuckin' her and slappin on that ass as well 
 See then inhales that long excel, and then you hear 
 The sounds of an orgasm yeah, yeah I was...
