Man, take another hit breathe out 
 In a zone blowing smoke out a glass teapot 
 I'm chillin' at home on some solo shit 
 I love piece and when its quiet, I don't want no bitch 
 I don't want to look at lifetime, I'm fine with fuse 
 Fuck entertainment weekly bitch, find some news 
 I like Keyshia but I need some blues 
 Steady hollering about some time 
 Bitch I need some Room 
 Don't get me wrong y'all I love females 
 That come around but after while, I need some self 
 I know I'm selfish at times but bottom line, move around if that ain't how you get down 
 Plus my album coming out real soon, I'm in the studio daily tryna write these tunes 
 And for you to stress a nigga like I'm running these hoes is outta line 
 Goodbye to your life, pack up your clothes and go 
 (Hook sung by Nina) 
 All I ever wanted was for him to see 
 Was that I was all the woman he would ever need 
 I've given all of me so unselfishly 
 And now he's at the door telling me to leave 
 Now where do I Go 
 I'm about to hit some spots with my guys from outta town 
 And there you go making those mean old eyes 
 Feel like I'm in prison sometimes 
 Like my freedom is gone like I've committed a crime and that's some bullshit 
 You watch a nigga like I'm 6 years old, how the fuck you think this shit gon? grow 
 I?ma tell you how this shit gon? go 
 I?ma hop off in this clean ass triple silver Porsche Turbo and hit the road and Go 
 You run a nigga blood pressure up from that spite shit 
 And normally I don't fuck with that type bitch 
 But she got a nigga feeling her though 
 Text messaging my phone I feel like killing this ho 
 But before I let her get on my row 
 I?ma hand the bitch her walking papers letting her go and hit the door 
 But yo, I ain't never seen a UFO 
 And I ain't never seen a ho that's more important that dough 
 So Go 
 (Hook sung by Nina) 
 All I ever wanted was for him to see 
 Was that I was all the woman he would ever need 
 I've given all of me so unselfishly 
 And now he's at the door telling me to leave 
 Now where do I Go 
 I'm rolling late night with my buzz on 
 Leaving out a strip club and wanting my fuck on 
 I'm strolling through a list of my missed calls 
 And right up out the blue man this bitch calls 
 You coming over here (woman's voice) 
 I'm like shit naw 
 So to question that decision she eats up a dick raw 
 But man, I'd rather go to bed with a hard dick 
 Than to have to spend the whole night fucking and arguing 
 This bitch a lunatic, fuck a nigga high off 
 I wish it was I way I could hit and just drive off 
 But that's not happening 
 So I?ma lay my ass down, watching girl's gone wild penis in my hand 
 Hardest times and I don't wanna sell out 
 Still I'm putting on my flip-flops to bail out 
 I grab my keys off the table and coat 
 It's an open invitation for a nigga to score, so I go! 
 (Hook sung by Nina) 
 All I ever wanted was for him to see 
 Was that I was all the woman he would ever need 
 I've given all of me so unselfishly 
 And now he's at the door telling me to leave 
 Now where do I Go
