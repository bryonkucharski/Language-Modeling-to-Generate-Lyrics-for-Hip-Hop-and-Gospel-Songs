The voices in my head are screaming louder than my lips 
 All the words I should have said are slipping through my fingertips 
 And ever after seems so far away from me 
 The voices in my head are screaming louder then my lips 
 It's like I have been living a lie 
 It's beautiful huh the way I can keep it inside 
 I'm settled in somebody's dream 
 Seeing through one of his eyes 
 Pieces of somebody's mind 
 Pictures of thoughts in the frame 
 I stand alone in the dark now 
 Sad and crippled and shamed 
 I loaded my pistol and aimed 
 Cocked it quick and then bang 
 Woke up in sweat feeling the death 
 Creates an eclipse in the brain 
 Sometimes I think I'm insane 
 I hear the voice when I'm asleep 
 Whispers my name again and again 
 This is what's she's singing to me 
 The voices in my head are screaming louder than my lips 
 All the words I should have said are slipping through my fingertips 
 And ever after seems so far away from me 
 The voices in my head are screaming louder then my lips 
 Sometimes I just want to cry 
 We kiss in the rain 
 She is speaking to me once again 
 Hands in my ear 
 But this isn't clear 
 I listen but nothings explained 
 This is a lie 
 A feeling inside 
 I still often drift when I drive 
 The tears they leave burns on my cheeks 
 Motionless mirrors with eyes staring me down 
 A view of a soul 
 The heart of a woman is cold 
 My conscious is weak 
 She making me weak 
 The only love I've ever known has left me alone 
 And I'm dying inside 
 The only thing left is my pride 
 The pain you hear in my rhyme 
 For happiness I'll never find 
 All in my mind 
 The voices in my head are screaming louder than my lips 
 All the words I should have said are slipping through my fingertips 
 And ever after seems so far away from me 
 The voices in my head are screaming louder then my lips 
 I think I've finally failed at something 
 I honestly believe that 
 Cause looking at us from outside 
 You would think we would take better care of our hearts 
 I died when you did mentally 
 Spiritually? 
 I'm numb I feel nothing 
 The voices in my head are screaming louder than my lips 
 All the words I should have said are slipping through my fingertips 
 And ever after seems so far away from me 
 The voices in my head are screaming louder then my lips
