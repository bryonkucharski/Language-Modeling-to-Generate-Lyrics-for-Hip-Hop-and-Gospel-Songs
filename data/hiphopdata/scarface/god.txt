(Scarface) 
 If I had to play God for a day 
 I would open up the gates, let the world see my face 
 Remove all doubt from the ones without the faith 
 And put them on the path of the straight 
 A safe place, for the young to come out if they want to play 
 I let their mommas know that they ok 
 And when y'all pray, I'll respond so you can all see a sign 
 And answer every pray one at a time 
 If I'm God huh, all the stabbings all the war would come to cease 
 My whole entire hood would be at peace, no more beef 
 And you could sleep without the fears of being woke 
 By the sounds of sirens, screams of people being smoked 
 No more dope you don't need it, you'll be cured of all diseases 
 Your whole entire life would be deleted 
 Please forgive me I've been dreaming 
 And rudely interrupted by the demons 
 Laughed at the picture I was seeing on the ceiling 
 (John Legend) 
 Who listens when we pray 
 Who pulls the strings of the world as we struggle today 
 Will you show your face 
 I don't want to wait wait, wait till I die 
 Wait wait, wait for my eyes to close 
 Smile on your child so he knows 
 God has a face 
 (Scarface) 
 Just imagine if the devil had a day 
 And God had took a break and walked away, would you feel safe? 
 If everything you loved turned into hate 
 Will the dark angel's evil show you grace 
 Only to be eaten by a snake, one life one mistake 
 Be careful of the choices that you make, cause one day 
 You'll be standing on your feet and then the next 
 You're underneath the sheet greeting death 
 I wonder when I sleep is he there sitting on my chest 
 Stealing breath, shortening my days even less 
 Lost souls never rest, a killer walks the streets seeking flesh 
 A adolescent hangs she's depressed 
 A priest who confessed, a judged typing a nigga in a text 
 Your honor, what the fuck did you expect? 
 A father kills his son look at life it's a mess 
 Just imagine what would happen if the lord up and left 
 (John Legend) 
 Who listens when we pray 
 Who pulls the strings of the world as we struggle today 
 Will you show your face 
 I don't want to wait wait, wait till I die 
 Wait wait, wait for my eyes to close 
 Smile on your child so he knows 
 God has face

 When all that you believed in was a lie 
 Are you willing to accept it when you find out 
 Or try to reason with yourself that's what it is when it's not 
 And all the whole while it's been a plot 
 To poison our minds and leave us blind to the fact 
 That they keep us in the dark know they act 
 We react all surprised and not realize that this shit a trap 
 Thought religion was the answer but the answer wasn't that 
 The church and these politics they all full of crap 
 It's a shame but that's how were blaming it's for the scratch 
 So I don't knock I'm tryna to put a black card in my wallet 
 But some dollars in my pocket ain't the topic 
 Y'all need to stop it 
 This is just crazy these little babies ticking time bombs 
 Walking around the lunchroom pulling guns 
 If momma and daddy took the time to raise their son 
 Then the sister wouldn't be the mom before she twenty-one huh 
 (John Legend) 
 Who listens when we pray 
 Who pulls the strings of the world as we struggle today 
 Will you show your face 
 I don't want to wait wait, wait till I die 
 Wait wait, wait for my eyes to close 
 Smile on your child so he knows 
 God has face
