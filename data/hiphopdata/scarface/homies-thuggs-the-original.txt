Ghetto niggas remain violent while the killers remain silent 
 Niggas strapped with 45's and ain't smiling 
 And I'm driving to a place they're all warrin' 
 The lake we build houses but it's the hood we call home 
 In the ghetto the only place a motherfucker will keep it real 
 We focused on the dollar bill, still 
 The outsiders tend to disrespect the place 
 Where niggas do their struggling die with a straight face 
 Surviving, under conditions demons dinin' 
 You can run it but can't hide it so step aside 
 It's the nigga that makes music for the streets 
 'Cause I love this motherfucker like pussy with no sheets, 
 Cause its deep 
 Some niggas make it out the neighborhood and won't surface 
 And let the money make them nervous, what's the purpose? 
 A motherfucker sitting on fat 
 He came up in the hood but he can't come back 
 Fuck that, I remain in the street game frame 
 On a mission to maintian me and take aim 
 In position to let my opposition know my life 
 Cause off in these streets I keep it real but what's right? 
 Surviving, sitting on a key doing business on a beeper 
 I'm sinking in this motherfucker deeper 
 Fear the reaper that no man born or woman harm me 
 Fuck being a nigga in your army; though I'm a killer 
 Enter the ghetto so that you can see 
 What I mean when I say I love this cause it love me 
 Let it be, stop looking at this motherfucker strange 
 And talking 'bout a motherfucking change 
 This is for my thug niggas 
 This is for my homies and my thug niggas (uuuuugh) 
 'Face, picture us working at McDonald's 
 And me and you selling fucking toasted up (?) 
 Gold slug, a car full of thug niggas 
 Twenty inch wheels candy paint so we drug dealers 
 No Limit soldiers to the fullest 
 See I was raised on some red beans the size of some bullets, huh 
 We ghetto niggas can't be stopped 
 Got me mixing up dope with little J down at Rap-A-Lot 
 My phone tapped the feds on my tail 
 Got me paying luxury taxes on everything I build 
 True to the ghetto that's my life 
 You see that house on the lake its for the kids and the wife 
 You can test me if you wanna 
 'Cause I be dumping niggas off from New Orleans to California 
 Rowdy like a hurricane (uuuuuugh) 
 Independant, black owned got them hooked on this cocaine 
 You used to see C in a suit and tie 
 But we young niggas in tennis shoes and diamonds 
 Executive street millionaires 
 Niggas gonna be 'bout it bout till we gray in the wheel chair 
 What do you get from boosting? 
 Niggas coming out from California to represent them niggas from 
 Houston 
 And now we rocking keep this shit popping 
 And all my niggas across the bay know L.A. keep the shit hot 
 I keep my glock inside my pants, don't give niggas a chance 
 To put me inside a casket you dirty bastards 
 Until the day I die you catch a nigga high off weed the police can't 
 Find me 
 My shit will drop and I'll sell five million 
 While all the niggas enter the game get caught up in drug dealing 
 How can I fall? how can I ball, how can I catch my enemies and murder 
 Them all? 
 My word of flame burn niggas inside their brain 
 Niggas can't hang with me, and like it changes, uh 
 Scarface got me on this shit 
 We laced it motherfuckers in their body and face, uh 
 Growing thicker, liquor made me daddy and nigga 
 Niggas don't wanna see me world wide mob figure 
 M.O.B. and the leaf keep me weeded 
 Them niggas don't wanna see me when I got weed in my system 
 Catch another victim, capture bodies 
 Bring a shottie to the fucking party, yeah 
 I party all night 
 I do this shit cause its wrong but we were born right 
 And to the niggas in my zone we do it long ways 
 Till these bitches understand nigga my song pay; 'cause I'm the man 
 Now these are my homeboys, we outlaws till the day we die 
 Keep this shit rough and raw my 45 
 Make sure that I survive to another day 
 To bust rhymes which from I get paid 
 Now that's the end of my freestyle but it was left for dead 
 But the shit away you can hear it playing, westside
