(Rush Davis) 
 Staring down the barrel of a colt 45 
 I'm feeling mad suicidal, so I think I'm gonna drive 
 Everything is hazy and I can't see my lanes 
 Demons got me seeing double in the rain 
 If I put the peddle to the metal, take my hands off the wheel 
 Lord if you hear me, steer, steer 
 Lord if you hear me, steer 
 I think I need to breathe 'cause I ain't feeling right 
 My conscience is at ease saying live your life 
 Got everything I ain't missin' much, bruh 
 Got my little paper back I ain't feeling fucked up 
 My woman got my back so I ain't stressed out 
 Side looking in, you can say I'm blessed huh 
 Career still intact got my street cred 
 Went on with life thinking that the beef's dead 
 But every now and then I get flash backs 
 Get down on my knees and I ask that 
 God keep my head on 'cause I don't wanna spaz out 
 Load back up that 45 and air a nigga, ass out

 Awaken by the sound of the siren 
 Helicopter spotlights illuminate the crime scene 
 Crowd gathers round try to find out what the fuck just happened 
 Wait a minute, time out 
 I looked a little closer at my t-shirt 
 I see squirts of blood just now starting to bleed worse 
 I'm lost I got blood on my hands, though 
 And then the camera man starts to pan slow 
 Realizing what I'm up against 
 I guess I just have to face the consequence 
 Snap back to reality 
 I gotta think fast, got some motherfuckers after me 
 Paranoid, got me running for my life now 
 Homicide, questioning my mama and my wife now 
 Parking lot, full of cops, got the dogs out 
 Running, chest burning, out of breath 
 About to fall out 
 Hit the corner, parked car at the stop sign 
 Going back to jail ain't the plan so the outline 
 Is to come up with something so I escape this or hand cuffs 
 Fuck that I ain't gonna take shit 
 I rather be carried by 6 than judged by 12 getting that cell 
 Or maybe they gon' gun a nigga down 
 'Cause they don't wanna see me in the trial
