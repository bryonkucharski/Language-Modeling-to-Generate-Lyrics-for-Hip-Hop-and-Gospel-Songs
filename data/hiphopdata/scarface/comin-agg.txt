Ah shit... I'm sick of niggas jumpin' up with choppers 
 Runnin' for your shit, tryin' to make another nigga stop ya 
 But it's on cause you up against a real nigga 
 I steal niggas and kill niggas, I'm the real nigga 
 You up against a muthafucka with a quick temper 
 I'm a born killer, in case you don't remember 
 I got my pistol but I got a different clip in it 
 Click-click, muthafuckas, can you get with it? 
 You ain't the nigga that you thought you was, fool 
 And now I'm after that ass on the cool 
 It's all about survival of the fittest 
 Nigga, you shouldn'ta did this 
 And now I gots to handle my business 
 I got to get your ass up out the picture 
 I ain't the nigga you wanna fuck with 
 Muthafucka, I wouldn't bullshit ya 
 Now look at what you stuck with 
 The last nigga in this muthafuckin world you shoulda fucked with 
 I'm leavin' niggas in bodybags 
 You shouldn'ta fucked with the Brad 
 You punk muthafucka, I'm comin' agg 
 Mr., Mr. Scarface for the nine-trey 
 Niggas packin nines, fuck you, bitch, I pack an A.K. 
 Fully automatic for you hoes who wanna jack this 
 S.A. fool, and I'ma put you on your back, bitch 
 Ain't no half-steppin, I'm comin' at you rough-like 
 Shootin to kill cause back in school I had enough fights 
 Whenever when I bucked my knuckles up on a nigga's head 
 So you can sling 'em all you want but I be slingin leg 
 Cause like I said befo' I'm a muthafuckin dreadlock 
 Puttin' fools in headlocks, givin' niggas headshots 
 And everybody in your muthafuckin area 
 Is tryin' to scrap up some money, so they can help to bury ya 
 But I can give a muthafuck about your family 
 Because your family ain't my fuckin' family 
 You shoulda thought before you stepped to tha 
 Nigga in black standin right here next to ya 
 I'm stoppin' muthafuckas from breathin 
 Just gimme a reason and I'ma be squeezin 
 The trigger of this muthafuckin glock, pop-pop until you drop 
 >From these muthafuckin gunshots 
 And leave your whole fuckin' family sad 
 Don't fuck with the Brad, muthafucka 
 Cause Brad's comin' agg 
 Where the cocksuckers at, where the cocksuckers at? 
 (Where they at? Where they at?) (There they go) at my gat 
 'Cause I'm about to heat up like a vet 
 Chop shit down on your set and then jet 
 And smash off in my soap box 
 'Cause I'm down for the dirt and muthafuckas said it don't stop 
 Now which one of you hoes wanna fuck 
 Make your way to your truck 
 I wanna see the way that you jump 
 Cause by the time you get your keys 
 I'm lettin loose, muthafucka, lay 'em down, nigga, and get these 
 It ain't shit for me to watch 'em fly 
 So die, muthafuckas, die, muthafuckas, die, die 
 I ain't no muthafuckin good guy, dog 
 And I don't give a good guy damn about none of y'all 
 I'm from the state of the muthafuckin gunslingers 
 Knockin' dicks in the dirt with just this one finger 
 So get your ass caught up in this gangsta shit 
 And I'ma try my best to make it stank, you bitch 
 Plus you comin' with that fake drag 
 You fallin' dead on your ass, you muthafucka 
 I'm comin' agg
