(Feat. Devin) 
 Walk up in the session wit my dick in my hand 
 Fat sweet in my mouth, 24 ounce can 
 Ain't got no time for all yesterday he say she say 
 Pull out the B-Tape give it to the DJ 
 My eyes are tight and shinin 'cause I'm smokin' some kill 
 Don't look at me go buy some drinks call up some hoes if you will 
 I see its nothin' but a party oh well I guess that I'm the host 
 Ain't nobody got no more weed its time to smoke 
 Keep that B rollin', you see everybody's holdin' they own 
 You know I got to bust at least 2 or 3 before I'm gone 
 But there's always 1 in the crowd rappin' loud 
 All in the niggaz mouth for all them bitches and cowards 
 With the East coast flow West coast body language 
 Don't know nothin' 'bout the South tryin' to find someone to hang wit 
 Man when you finish flowin, or whatever the fuck you doin' 
 Holla at me I'll be in the bathroom boo boo'n 
 Had to get away needed some time to chill 
 So I bought a 59 and got behind the wheel 
 Scooped up a fat sack of kill I'll be drivin' a while 
 Takin' 2 or 3 pulls every 5 or 6 miles 
 I can't wait to see my road dogs you know how we do it 
 Just like a case of beer piece of cotton through one right through it 
 And all the bitches know me I hit quite a few they be glad to see me Niggaz don't give 'em dick like I do 
 I bust about 2 then they tell they friends then I'm in 
 With my French tickler makin' they pussy lips lips grin 
 And there's always one in the crowd 
 Talkin' loud found out I fucked her cousin 
 Now she runnin' her mouth leavin' notes on my windshield 
 I'm a bitch I'm a hoe 
 Early in the mornin bitches knockin' at my mamas door 
 Mama please when you finish whatever that you doin' 
 Who ever that is tell I'm in the bathroom boo boo'n 
 I got a visit from an old friend fresh out the county 
 He said he came up on a lick and he was glad that he found me 
 He had some new niggas wit him full of drink and lookin' sweaty 
 Cockin gats back talkin' bout, "Come on D man you ready?" 
 It's a house down the street about two doors down 
 They sell weed and they least got 2 whole pounds 
 Man all we gots to do is hit this ride and we cool 
 Let's fuck his wife and take his weed and bust on that fool 
 We can all come up what ever we get we split 
 Ain't nobody sayin' nothin' ain't nobody seen shit 
 So let's pile up five deep in your 'llac 
 He'll know that it's you, D, and he won't think it's a jack 
 Man you must be smokin' crack you don't know who dat is 
 That nigga work for HBD been sellin weed round here for years 
 So whenever you finish plottin, schemin whatever you doin' 
 Wait for me I'll be in the bathroom boo boo'n
