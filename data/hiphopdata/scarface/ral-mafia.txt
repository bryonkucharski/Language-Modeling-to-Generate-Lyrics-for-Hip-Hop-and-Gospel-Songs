(Feat. Yukmouth) 
 (Yukmouth) 
 I live the life of a hoodlum 
 Take ten paces, turn around and shoot 'em 
 Concrete Budda 
 We threw 'em in the creak to lose 'em 
 Streets polluted with drugs 
 Salute 'em with thugs 
 We used to 
 Sleep on a rug 
 A momma never said she loved 
 Or hugged us 
 It's just us, me and my two sisters 
 I'm too whooshes 
 Plus new bushes 
 With .22's up in the bushes 
 We ride, G's 
 Menace to societies 
 The real shit 
 Fuck a movie, the village 
 We filled with Chinese 
 Essays, Niggas, Cambodians 
 Or go against the police 
 Thugged Out like Napoleon 
 Grab the milli, from my belly, catch new welly 
 Slugs in your Pelle Pelle, smell me 
 Since Makaveli died, it's like the Westcoast shit died 
 But Régime be the realest shit alive 
 Ride or die 
 So high am I, Nigga you can't tell from the eyes 
 Blood shot red 
 The feds gettin' bread from the pies 
 Wiseguys cops risk lay-off to stay off the block 
 Transportin' drop the Yay off 
 You paid off the top 
 Smoke-A-Lot popular on the lock 
 For flippin' birds like Nadia 
 Mafia, Rap-A-Lot Mafia 
 (Willie D) 
 My Nigga, my Nigga 
 I'm here to say to 
 You try to tell it 
 Can even spell it 
 It's about respect 
 For God knows you was talking too 
 And the slap came 
 We be the realest motherfuckers in the Rapgame 
 Rap-A-Lot Mafia, you ain't ready for what we got for ya 
 I make a motherfucker doctor ya 
 See, it ain't all about records 
 We run the motherfuckin' streets in Houston, Texas 
 We mobilize and we been rated high 
 Our adversaries die, when our pull a fry, bullets fly 
 Like some motherfuckin' Blackbirds 
 When we ride 
 It's caskets and con words 
 Mob Nigga 
 (T.L.T of the Ghetto Twiinz) 
 Fuck peace 
 See it's all about violence 
 Put that Tek to you silent 
 Leave you howlin 
 I'ma creep upon ya (Yeah) 
 I'ma put it on ya (Who) 
 Drop bombs on ya like they did in Oklahoma 
 (Mz. G.B. of the Ghetto Twiinz) 
 See ones that Nigga Yuk, look 
 Somebody gon die 
 You could took a try 
 And kiss that ass goodbye 
 You be found in your home Nigga 
 Head blown from that Chrome 
 Fuck with me, I'm livin' wrong Nigga 
 (T.L.T of the Ghetto Twiinz) 
 Nigga remember me

 You better pray that God has switched ya 
 Fuckin' round with the Mafia 
 You torn blood from you bitches 
 Nigga what 
 Bustin' holes in you bitches 
 (Mz. G.B. of the Ghetto Twiinz) 
 You better wear you vest, real tight bitch 
 The Mafia gonna put it in you life bitch 
 Ain't no motherfucker stoppin' up 
 The only bitch puttin' it down with the Mafia 
 Rap-A-Lot Mafia 
 (DMG of FaceMob) 
 Niggas sure wonder why I hang with these thugs 
 Cause my Nigga Yuk fuckin' these Niggas up 
 Nigga, this Rap-A-Lot, Mafia till I die 
 Why? Because we ride 
 Everyday do or die 
 Riffles and .45's 
 17-shot 9's 
 Right up between your eyes 
 Niggas is gon die 
 Niggas come from the pound 
 Hummers and S-S's 
 Born to be a killer 
 Fill a Nigga 
 Body with holes 
 Head the toe when he showed up 
 Blow up your whole motherfuckin' head, quote us 
 And I'ma roll, with my Niggas till the wheels fall 
 Clean up the motherfuckin' car 
 And in this room we bring the world war 
 (007 of the 5th Ward Boyz) 
 See the Circlepiece be the satellite 
 From the 5th Ward 
 Command union, how we do it, how we do it 
 From the South 
 Texas roll real, swing wide knock 'em out 
 Double "0" and Yuk worldwide what you talkin' about 
 See the .45's, see the big faces 
 Catchin' murder cases, hood erasers 
 Paper chasers 
 With the 98, sittin' on steakes 
 Ballin' in the bay with the Tek to place 
 (E-Rock of the 5th Ward Boyz) 
 Recognize the Mob bitch 
 All day this thug shit 
 Blisted up, trigger fingers for Niggas that start shit 
 Creep this as I part quick 
 Ride dopefiend, will her with a tint 
 AK's and vest's 
 Born in California, killed down in Texas 
 Ohoh, slow your roll here come the po-po's 
 Anything can happen ridin' through execution capital 
 E-Rock the stupid fo', who's ridin' with this Nigga Yuk 
 We the Mafia, squabble the gun 
 Played out, droppin' ya 
 (Lo-Life of the 5th Ward Boyz) 
 We mob figgers 
 We to take the whole world out 
 At 50 states all Black God 
 After that, we still gon grind on the side 
 To make your motherfuckers mind 
 I pop the 9, you pop the 9 
 And all y'all motherfuckers dyin' 
 We gon drive by 
 We walk up and do these Niggas out the game 
 We sell 2 shot, and none left in the chain 
 'Cause it's Rap-A-Lot Mafia man 
 Is to be fuckin' with man 
 Watch who you talk to 
 We kill 
 If that's what it's brought down to 
 (Capone of FaceMob) 
 Off with his motherfuckin' head with the lead 
 Dead leave his Hilfiger shirt all red 
 Said it's motherfucker locked in your spot 
 Shot's will be dropped, right here, right now 
 Paw, Niggas all the way tugged down 
 Town 
 Ride around town showin' out 
 Pounds 
 City after city fuckin' hoes 
 Yours ain't a lot act like you know 
 Capone with the city complete assassinater 
 With paper, blow up a Nigga shit like sky pagers 
 It's major, save a whole out of not 
 Stop, if you think your feelin' fin popped 
 Rap-A-Lot can't stop, won't, don't stop 
 And we did already hit the top 
 Rap-A-Lot can't stop, won't, don't stop 
 And we did already hit the top 
 Mob 
 (Lil' Chylla of the Snypaz) 
 I be comin' through rages 
 And Niggas thinkin' I pissed off 
 I'm itchin' to get my sick off 
 I be trickin' them if they trick off 
 All hands about to get kicked off 
 (2-4 of the Snypaz) 
 Nigga I got 'em 
 Fuck up your body when the slugs touch down 
 Runnin' up on me you feel it 
 The realest and platinum bound 
 With the Nigga called Yuk 
 We brakin' bed and ballin 
 Feds hollin' 
 Bloody bodies with no heads 
 And calling your momma Nigga 
 (Lil' Chylla of the Snypaz) 
 Yo, who the Mob, feel her 
 Rap-A-Lot Nigga 
 Kick that John quicker 
 I missed the bomb disher 
 Flat the palms 
 Money is in my figures 
 (2-4 of the Snypaz) 
 With our triggers 
 Snypaz be red dot Niggas 
 We the Mafia and Yuk sent your picture 
 So we're droppin' 
 (Lil' Chylla of the Snypaz) 
 Maybe you speakin' 
 Role one 
 Kill each other, smoke some 
 Po-po's pass to folks some 
 Rap-A-Lot Mafia known from 
 (??) 
 We put's limits on Niggas 
 We hold money over bitches 
 Let the whole world recognize the realest 
 When it's bangin' Rap-A-Lot Mafia 
 The street's most popular 
 Servin' your hood like helicopters 
 Say the wrong thing and I'll slaughter ya 
 Disrespect the Mob, young catch punkin' heads 
 Wishin' you was dead 
 Layin in bed the next 
 Nigga what did I say 
 To make these Niggas act this way 
 Rich thugs still got me muggs 
 Just to remind a motherfucker, about where I was 
 Nothin' but love from my thugs 
 Get your paper cause 
 We laugh and drink when we rich, black and know this spore 
 Nigga this Rap-A-Lot Mafia 
 (J Prince) 
 You ain't gotta come from Cranestreet 
 200 or Circlepiece 
 It's all about do you believe 
 Rap-A-Lot Mafia life 
 Rap-A-Lot on the streets 
 (Scarface of the Geto Boys) 
 Recognize the Mob or get you ass mobbed on 
 No love to ones who oppose 
 We taggin' motherfuckers toes 
 And we ain't even got a dresscode 
 Just those, 1000 Niggas infront of Expo's 
 Waitin' on the next goes 
 So lets roll and lets go 
 Ain't no sissy Niggas survivin' 
 If you don't come with them you got a problem 
 Solve 'em, hit 'em with the .44 revolver 
 Make an amount of what believe is right before his daughter 
 Exactly like the doctor ordered 
 Dressin' your homies up in church clothes 
 You took the shot, that brought the black hoe 
 And that's cold, but that's the motherfuckin' thing 
 Respect the Mob and Little J and the family name
