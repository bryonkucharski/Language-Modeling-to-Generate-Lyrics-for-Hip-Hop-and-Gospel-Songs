Had it all wanted more so you got you some fast cash to keep you rollin' 
 Credit cards slit your throat now it won't let go 
 Yeah you've gotta get out before it takes control 
 It's a big black hole it'll swallow your soul 
 When greed is all that motivates 
 You'll hang yourself and seal your fate 
 And you'll go down swinging from an old tree 
 Suicide of the worst degree 
 It'll be too late to get yourself free 
 'Cause you'll be too far down 
 Was it worth the betrayal that made you bleed 
 To get your silver to feed your greed 
 Oh it's a deadly so don't let it in 
 For what it's worth everything on the earth's not enough 
 To keep you going 
 What you want never need only fuels you're greed 
 Yeah, you gotta get out before it takes control 
 It's a big black hole that'll swallow your soul 
 When greed is all that motivates 
 You'll hang yourself and seal your fate 
 And you'll go down swinging from an old tree 
 Suicide of the worst degree 
 It'll be too late to get yourself free 
 'Cause you'll be too far down 
 Was it worth the betrayal that made you bleed 
 To get your silver to feed your greed 
 Oh it's a deadly sin don't let it in 
 All the pennies in your pockets 
 Won't get you through the needles eye 
 The one thing that you're needing 
 Money just can't buy 
 And you'll go down swinging from an old tree 
 Suicide of the worst degree 
 It'll be too late to get yourself free 
 'Cause you'll be too far down 
 Was it worth the betrayal that made you bleed 
 To get your silver to feed your greed
