Chorus: Scarface 
 Money and the power, money and the power 
 I ain't fallin' short I got the 
 Money and the power 
 Yup! Hehehahaha, hehe ha hah hah... yeah 
 Money and the power, money and the power 
 Never goin' back 'cause I got 
 Money and the power 
 (Scarface) 
 Deep in the heart of South Park lurks a stalker 
 S.A. fool, native Houston South Parker 
 Born and brought up to be a heartless motherfucker 
 No one else to blame, fuck it blame it on my mother 
 When I was growin' up nobody seemed to give a shit 
 And that's what makes me one hard son of a bitch 
 Since they ain't give a shit, I ain't give a shit either 
 Sweet 16, time to stack me up some ki's 
 Learned the game of hustlin, fuckin' dopefienders 
 Sellin niggaz beat, in other words amphetamines 
 My game was more advanced, sellin speed I'm goin' broke 
 Got 'em up with Floyd and Floyd had fronted me some dope 
 Learned to rock it up, now I got it sold 
 Time to go for broke, motherfuck who I owe 
 Business started boomin, started movin powder 
 Motherfuck the bitches I want money and the power... yup! 
 Chorus: Scarface 
 Money and the power, money and the power 
 I ain't fallin' short I got the 
 Money and the power 
 Yup! 
 Money and the power, money and the power 
 Bitches on my dick 'cause I got 
 Money and the power 
 (Scarface) 
 Bought me a Caddy, 30's and vogues 
 Brand new crib, brand new clothes 
 Mom would ask questions, and often pitch a bitch 
 Where am I gettin' the money? Mickey D's ain't paid me shit 
 I'd make up a story, just to get her off my back 
 Uh oh I got a beep I think my boys are out of crack 
 Everything was smooth, exactly how I played it 
 A dollar to be made, best believe a nigga made it 
 Nickels dimes and twenties, and sixty cent bumps 
 Nigga rollin' hard, stackin paper like Trump 
 And I ain't give a fuck I told you that from the jump 
 Didn't worry about no static I had a motherfuckin pump 
 Ass out of line, word 'em up a nigga sprayed em 
 Momma told me shoot first, and ask questions later... 
 Six hundred bucks a motherfuckin hour 
 And I ain't fallin' short 'cause I got money and the power, yup 
 Chorus: Scarface 
 Money and the power, money and the power 
 I ain't fallin' short I got the 
 Money and the power 
 Yeah... 
 Money and the power, money and the power 
 I got it like dat, 'cause I got 
 Money and the power 
 (Scarface) 
 There goes 21, and still stackin 30's 
 Brought my brother Warren Lee down from New Jersey 
 He helped me for a minute then he started screwin up 
 Said fuck gettin' paid, I guess my brother'd rather fuck 
 Bitches ran his life, and they're still runnin' Lee 
 I guess he doesn't realize the bitch is fuckin' me 
 It really doesn't matter, cause Ac'll never tell 
 He can stay broke, but I got dope to sell 
 I step out on the cut, shit was lookin' funny 
 I ran back in the house and started callin up my money 
 I signaled for my workers, to bring in all the dope 
 I can feel the bust and sure enough in comes the 5-0 
 Niggaz stayed relaxed but they was friskin niggaz up 
 If someone said my name then I was definitely fucked 
 But I'ma play it cool, if I kill I gotta kill 
 Fightin for my shit, I never ran and never will 
 Come to find out, they wasn't fuckin' with my boys 
 Busted a nigga who said he paid em, talkin' noise 
 Hehehehehe... I guess the juices are sour 
 But I ain't fallin' short 'cause I got money and the power YUP! 
 Chorus: Scarface 
 Money and the power, money and the power 
 Sold a million records I got 
 Money and the power 
 Yup! 
 Money and the power, money and the power 
 Best to come clean, 'cause I got 
 Money and the power 
 Money and the power, money and the power 
 Money and the pow-the-pow-the-pow-the-pow-the-power!
