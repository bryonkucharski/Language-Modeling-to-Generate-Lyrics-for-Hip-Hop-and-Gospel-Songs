(Scarface) 
 Just waking up I gotta thank god 
 Fired up a square, that's how my day starts 
 Early mornin' buzzin' got me lookin' at life 
 Outside I see movin' bitches look at the lights 
 It's just another Saturday it seems like 
 Got dressed and hit the corner with my team right 
 Smoke it, roll it up and pass it around 
 Now I'm stoned and my ass is barely draggin' the ground 
 No sooner than you think I would've thought of 
 A cop walks over, never saw him 
 "Excuse me, mister officer man, I wasn't tryna disrespect" 
 And started coughin' again 
 Eyes red as a bandana 
 And one time heavy on his antenna 
 At his request they sent a squad car 
 And then they put my black ass behind bars 
 (Jack Freeman) 
 Oh, sittin' on this concrete couch, just waitin' 
 For the judge to say that I'm gon' be free today 
 Oh, sittin' in this concrete box, just sayin' 
 It's been a shitty day, can't find no other words to say 
 (Yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 (Scarface) 
 Fingerprinted and gettin' booked in 
 They fed a nigga [?], so I took ten 
 'Cause I'm knowing that I'll be sittin' here the whole night 
 Empty trunk tank, it's finna be a cold flight 
 I finally come up on some housin' 
 Old celly, so I'm bettin' me a thousand 
 And plus I got a bottom bunk pass 
 Boss came in with his punk ass 
 Talkin' to a nigga like it's date time 
 Askin' where I'm from, I'm from H-town 
 Niggas askin' me what I'm in for 
 Nosy motherfuckers want some info 
 I tell him, "Dog, I ain't done shit 
 You know these redneck crackers think they run shit." 
 It's lights out, I tie my mat down 
 Chuck it on the rack and stretch my ass out 
 (Jack Freeman) 
 Oh, sittin' on this concrete couch, just waitin' 
 For the judge to say that I'm gon' be free today 
 Oh, sittin' in this concrete box, just sayin' 
 It's been a shitty day, can't find no other words to say 
 (Yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 (Scarface) 
 It's court call in the halls 
 Strip a nigga down to his balls 
 Bare-butt, naked in my tennis shoes 
 The nighttime sergeant want an interview 
 They push us out like livestock 
 "Ain't no talkin' while I'm talkin', this is my block" 
 I finally get to see me a judge 
 I'm a black man, so she got a grudge 
 Old bitch full of race hate 
 And a nigga quick to represent the gray state 
 I ain't got a lawyer, I don't need one 
 Give me thirty days, you get three one 
 I ain't tryna piss in a jug, bitch 
 Just because I'm black, I get fucked with 
 Babe, if I had been a white dude 
 I'd have never been arrested, look at Michael 
 And even if I swam like a fish, though 
 They still would've threw me in the Crisco 
 And fried a nigga's ass in some hot grease 
 I'm just tryna get my ass out the hot seat
