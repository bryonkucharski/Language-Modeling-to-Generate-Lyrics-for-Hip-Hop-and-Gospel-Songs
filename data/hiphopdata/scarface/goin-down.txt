(Riiinnnngggg) "Don't answer that" 
 "Hello, I'm not at home, leave a message (beep) 
 "Yo, bitch, this is (beep) pick up the phone, bitch 
 I know you're in there 
 You fucking with that old fucking ass 'Face now, huh bitch 
 Where my motherfucking kids at, bitch 
 Fucking bitch, punk ass bitch!" 
 (Scarface) 
 Hey, today must be my lucky day 
 I turned the corner, hit the block and seen that ass from a mile away 
 (Now where's she staying?) she must be new in the hood 
 But I ain't trippin' on that shit, 'cause it's all good 
 I rolled up on her, and I asked her her name 
 Ain't a damn thing changed, ain't no shame in my game 
 She said, " Used to go Thomas" 
 I slowed my roll, 'cause she just might be one of my homies' babies mamas 
 Now where your man at, she said "Gone at work" 
 Gave me the look, I cracked a smile and thinkin', "Go on and flirt" 
 My homies women ain't no thing to me, 
 'Cause if they caught one of my ho's, they'd do the same to me 
 And furthermore she was peepin' my ride 
 Convertible, 64, with the ride inside 
 Super clean with the discs and vogues 
 Higher than a fuck spittin' this to hoes: 
 Please excuse my attitude, sorry if I'm being rude 
 But I've got something to say to you 
 Hoping you won't lose your cool 
 I wanna sneak you out to play with me, 
 You can spend the day with me 
 And we can ride and see the sights 
 It's going down tonight ... 
 (Scarface) 
 Reminiscing on the bitch that I had back in the day 
 Gave the bitch a call and she hung up in my face 
 Now that's the pits 
 She didn't have to put up a front 
 I stuck that ass back in there 
 And haven't called her for 3 months 
 I guess it's in me to be doggin' a chic 
 Can't understand how you niggas just be hogging your bitch 
 Go on and pass her, unass her, send her to the master 
 Let her take a ride with the Bradster 
 It cool, don't front ...ooh, no sex 
 No sweat-not even on my mind-we just met 
 And furthermore, we can get to those 
 But for now I'm rolling 'Raris spitting this to hoes: 
 (Scarface) 
 Now I'm cruisin' to the crib with this bitch that I scooped 
 Parked my Ferrari, now I'm back in the coup 
 I knocked her boots - your baby's mama put me to work 
 I tagged that ass from the back, and knocked her shit in the dirt 
 She wanted me badly so I put it inside 
 She got the (front, back, and side to side) 
 Back and forth with the gangster glide 
 Started off at 6 and didn't finish till 9 
 Hit the showers like I been out playing ball for the day 
 Now she's asleep, 'cause she just had her drawers full of dick 
 (Now that's sick) and plus she got you staying at home 
 With the kids all alone while she's gettin' her fuck on 
 So believe me when you downin' the Brad 
 I'm at the pad with your baby mama clowning that ass 
 So player hatin' niggas check the bitch you chose 
 I'll be mobbing in my 'benz spitting this to ho's:
