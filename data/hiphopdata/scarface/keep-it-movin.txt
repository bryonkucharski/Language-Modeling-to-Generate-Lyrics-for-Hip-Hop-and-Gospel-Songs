 If this is love I don't see it 
 Can't make me believe it 
 You a nice girl, but I'm a hood nigga on some street shit 
 And yeah, you know my weakness 
 Sucker for some love type 
 I come from the slums girl, you come from a good life 
 I wonder what you see in me 
 I love weed and Hennessy 
 You barely doing happy hour, I ain't never seen you drink 
 And now that's leaving me to think, how I got so close to you? 
 This was just a hit and split, that's what I supposed to do 
 One thing let up to the next, I'm addicted to your sex 
 You addicted to this dick, every cause has its effect 
 That's what I get I guess, I can't commit that's killing this 
 You gave me an ultimatum, I'm numb I ain't feeling shit 
 Must not know who she dealing with 
 Puddles on her pillow case, tears running, eyeline, lipstick smeared 
 Hey are you ok? 
 You disobey, you pay for that 
 Well, the love is gone, and she ain't made it back, pray for that 
 (Avant) 
 What happened to us, you acting foolish 
 I'm acting foolish, what we need to do is 
 Keep it movin', that's what we need to do 
 Before something happens we better keep it movin' 
 I'm 'bout to lose it, we're going through it 
 This shit confusin', what we need to do is 
 Keep it movin', that's what we need to do 
 Before something happens we better keep it movin'

 I'm just sayin', a relationship should be 100-100 not 50-50, right? 
 Right 
 Oh what you gon' think about that? 
 Yeah I'm gon' think about that 
 Look, you want me here or not? 
 (Scarface) 
 Think before you answer that, it's hard enough we breaking up 
 But after this no turning back, brought this on myself with her 
 Mistakes I'm forced to live with that, I'm knowing more mistakes to come 
 I'm human, that's my best excuse, in fact my only one 
 Tears fall, my kids call, 'This ain't me, it's his fault' 
 Oh shit no, we did this 
 A partnership with no room for forgiveness 
 I take the blame, take your aim 
 Shoot that shot, can't wait to claim 
 All of this, in Jesus name 
 Pray in church, they give you change 
 I feel your pain 
 Songs sung in the key of life, with no meaning right 
 Hopefully one day might come I'd see the light 
 Can't sleep at night 
 And I'm wondering who's fooling who? 
 I'm sure you know who's fucking me, 'cause I know who's been fucking you 
 We used to be inseparable, never thought that that day would come 
 Where I'd take that shit so serious, and you get so good at playing dumb, you got away with one

 You had me I'll admit that, fell into the trap you set 
 Lookin' me in my eyes, lyin', killing me with that soaking wet 
 Wouldn't let me meet your connect 
 Scratching me all across my face 
 Says she loves the way it feels when I'm in it all the way 
 60 calls a day, wondering where the fuck I'm at 
 Wondering where the fuck I stay, who else I fuck like that 
 Now let's be honest, you got him with whom you made your promise 
 And let us not forget, it's her with whom I made my woman 
 I know our days are numbered, enjoying moments after 
 Plus in lust we fell in love, the pains are more than laughter 
 Living our separate lives, are husbands reckless why? 
 Beneath the questions lie, why was she left to cry? 
 Should have left shit quiet, but you was out of line 
 Better step aside, gotta tell me why? 
 I was everything, you was all I had 
 Now this is change, and then this change is bad 
 Make a note of that
