Where I'm from killers go dumb, usually death is the outcome 
 Welcome to the jungle, where kidnappers haunt you 
 The streets, they really want you 
 I'm serious, no smile on this block, gives answers if you curious 
 Good times disappear quickly back into a mist 
 Shooter hardly ever miss, that means I'm accurate 
 Crack the pitch man, pretty soon Ima have to switch 
 Scratchin' the itch with paper cuts on my index 
 The real riders shoot up blocks and screams who next 
 Like my nigga two text, he told two text 
 Done been in beef before but in Houston they call it plex 
 Gotta know the protocol, I'm warnin' y'all it gets deep 
 So deep, the prison guards'll put you to sleep 
 Rest eternally, no comin' back, ya O.D., overdose 
 This neighborhood got me comatose 
 Back against the wall, another statistic I know 
 The streets always been my daddy and mommy is the county jail 
 I'ma soldier and I'm about my mail 
 And if I get busted I'm not about to tell 
 'Cause I'm a gangsta 
 The streets always been my daddy and mommy is the county jail 
 I'ma soldier and I'm about my mail 
 I ain't tryin' to do right, I'm already livin' in pain 
 'Cause I'm a gangsta 
 The gas prices too high, the pay raise is too low 
 I'm better off in the game flippin' kicks like Judo 
 Or out somewhere pimpin' gettin' money and by the two wholes 
 That's why I'm at the lab of the product, spittin' you flows 
 Feds' watchin' my hood, entirely too much gun play 
 Neighborhood basketball stars slain last Monday 
 Raided the neighborhood, king pen last Tuesday 
 If this was goin' on in your neighborhood what would you say? 
 Given the opportunity to tell it to the masters 
 Lower middle class still a carryin' bus passes 
 Young girls givin' birth before they hit the ninth grade 
 'Bout to be a mom and can't even make Kool Aid 
 Who made this crack anyway? Told us about the heroin 
 Sold us alcohol and the guns that we carry 'round 
 Can't blame us for everything goin' wrong in the States 
 I don't blame a nigga for nothin' he do to get cake 
 The streets always been my daddy and mommy is the county jail 
 I'ma soldier and I'm about my mail 
 And if I get busted I'm not about to tell 
 'Cause I'm a gangsta 
 The streets always been my daddy and mommy is the county jail 
 I'ma soldier and I'm about my mail 
 I ain't tryin' to do right, I'm already livin' in pain 
 'Cause I'm a gangsta 
 It's like the ghetto's got a heart and a soul, a mind of it's own 
 A hunger for a young cat to die 'fore he grown 
 A lust for a young girl to slide down a pole 
 She's always fallin' short on her goals 
 The street life is cold, it's either win or lose or you fold 
 Money is the root to all evils what I was told 
 When everything you thought you'd believed in was a hoax 
 You put your faith in front of those demons 
 And when the smoke clears, the truth appear 
 The fight for your life, the struggles of a wrong versus right 
 And wrong won, a song sung in the keys of reality 
 When death crosses your path, blood shed tragically 
 So automatically you come to a close and realize 
 That no matter what we key to the codes 
 I seen the hood swallow muthafuckas whole 
 The shit amountin' in the system ain't never make it home, that I know 
 The streets always been my daddy and mommy is the county jail 
 I'ma soldier and I'm about my mail 
 And if I get busted I'm not about to tell 
 'Cause I'm a gangsta 
 The streets always been my daddy and mommy is the county jail 
 I'ma soldier and I'm about my mail 
 I ain't tryin' to do right, I'm already livin' in pain 
 'Cause I'm a gangsta
