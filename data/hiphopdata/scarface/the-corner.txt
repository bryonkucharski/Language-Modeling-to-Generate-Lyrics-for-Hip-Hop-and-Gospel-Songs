Memories on the corners with the fo's and the mo's 
 Walk to the store for the rose, talking straightforward to hoes 
 Got uncles that smoke, and some put blow up they nose 
 To cope with the lows, the wind is cold and it blows 
 In their socks and their soles, niggas holding they rolls 
 Corners leave souls opened and closed, hoping for mo' 
 With nowhere to go, niggas rolling in droves 
 They shoot the wrong way, 'cause they ain't knowin' their goals 
 The streets ain't safe 'cause they ain't knowing the code 
 By the foes I was told, either focus or fold 
 Got cousins with flows, hope they open some doors 
 So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls 
 Now I roll in a Olds, with windows that don't roll 
 Down the roads where cars get broken and stole 
 These are the stories told by Stony and Cottage Grove 
 The world is cold, the block is hot as a stove 
 On the corners 
 I wish I could give you this feeling 
 I wish I could give this feeling 
 On the corners niggas rob or kill 
 And dying just to make a living, huh? 
 We overstated, we underrated, we educated 
 The corner was our time when time stood still and 
 Gators and snakeskins and 
 Yellow and pink and profiles 
 Street lights and deep nights, cats trying to eat right 
 Riding no-seat-bikes, with work to feed hypes 
 So they can get sweet Nike's, they head and they feet right 
 Desires of street life, cars and weed types 
 It's hard to breathe nights, days are thief-like 
 The beasts roam the streets, the police is Greek-like 
 Game at its peak, we speak and believe hype 
 Bang in the streets hats cocked left or deep right 
 It's steep life, coming up where niggas is sheep-like 
 Rappers and hoopers, we strive to be like 
 G's with three strikes, seeds that need light 
 Cheese and recite, needs and BE strife 
 The corner, where struggle and greed fight 
 We write songs about wrong 'cause it's hard to see right 
 Look to the sky, hoping it will bleed light 
 Reality's a bitch, and I heard that she bites 
 The corner 
 I wish I could give you this feeling 
 I wish I could give this feeling 
 On the corners niggas rob or kill 
 And dying just to make a living, huh? 
 The corner was our magic, our music, our politics 
 Fires raised as tribal dances and war cries 
 Broke out on different corners 
 Power to the people 
 Black power 
 Black is beautiful 
 Black church services, murderers, Arabs serving burgers 
 As cats with gold permanents, move they bags as herbalists 
 The dirt isn't just fertile, it's people working and earning this 
 The curb getters go where the cash flow and the current is 
 It's so hot that niggas burn to live 
 The furnace is, where the money moving, the determined live 
 We talk shit, play lotto, and buy German beers 
 It's so black packed with action that's affirmative 
 The corners 
 I wish I could give you this feeling 
 I wish I could give this feeling 
 On the corners niggas rob or kill 
 And dying just to make a living, huh? 
 The corner was our Rock of Gibraltar, our Stonehenge 
 Our Taj Mahal, our monument 
 Our testimonial to freedom, to peace, and to love 
 Down on the corner
