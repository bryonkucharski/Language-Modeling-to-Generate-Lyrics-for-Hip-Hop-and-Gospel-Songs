I got this coffee pot of white soap 
 Stuck my hanger down the center 
 When I entered I spent it cause it was like dope 
 But on the real-a he was jackin' me for scratch 
 Cause out of 36 ounces this motherfucker brought me 20 back 
 I'm slanging 20 sacs 'cause I done lost 16 
 And these goddamn streets ain't going to bring me back 
 Now could it be the southside big baller 
 Bolo rock slanger stones done got slaughtered-damn 
 I'm going up on my whole thangs 
 And stepped on don't go runnin' my clique 'cause it's a old game 
 And all I ever wanted was some hundred stacks 
 I went from slangin' o-z's to movin' hundred sacks 
 Gotta make my money back 
 'Cause I done came too far up in these goddamn streets 
 To get my money snatched 
 I'm so for real about this motherfuckin skrill 
 That any obstacle obscuring my paper is gettin' killed 
 For real 
 (Scratching and mixing) 
 All I have is this small skrilla 
 I know this nigga run this game of life 
 So motherfuckin sheist that at night he got to sleep with lights 
 'Cause he done come across with shit so shade 
 That mutha fuckers comin' with clips to locate him 
 Ain't no waitin and once they spot him they gon' sure face him 
 And once the got him they gon' sure waste him 
 This ain't no mutha fuckin' joke nigga it ain't worth it 
 And even if your mother gets in it you can't surface 
 It was all purpose 
 Just like that bullshit you was serving it was all purpose 
 We all chipped in nigga and we all hurting 
 I gots to grind just like in eighty-nine 
 When a niggas 25 cent pieces look just like baby dimes 
 I'm on the corner selling whole eights 
 I don't remember being this fuckin' paranoid since I sold weight 
 I went from 50 sacs to 50 packs 
 And all because this motherfucker got jipped he wants to jip me back 
 But when I find him I'm gon finalize him 
 Just to let a nigga know I'm for real and down to die for mine 
 And I'm for real about this mutha fuckin' skrill 
 That any obstacle obscuring my paper is gettin' killed 
 For real 
 Game made to be swift since eighty-six when I started 
 Seems like niggas with hustle got outsmarted 
 Cause now they wanna analyze they homies for scratch 
 Catch them when they sleeping come down and up scrap 
 And even though I plotted hittin' niggas for ends 
 I never took out straps and shot gats at friends 
 It was all about being for real where I was from 
 Where very few niggas came real but I was one 
 I dedicate this to my homies stuck in battle 
 Living life being caught up in this mutha fuckin' gamble 
 The game made to be changed but the niggas still started 
 Cocaine seems to be blamed for the niggas gettin' slaughtered 
 How many times you had your homie shot 
 By the same mutha fucker whose game came from your homies block 
 Niggas get caught up in the paper chase 
 And lose respect for the game 
 That was honored before the cake was made
