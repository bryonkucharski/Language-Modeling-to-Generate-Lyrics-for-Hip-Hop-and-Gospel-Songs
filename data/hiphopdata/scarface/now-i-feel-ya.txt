...It's a new day... ya know what I'm sayin'? 
 A new day, brings a new problem to a brother 
 And all I gots ta say is thank god for my mother 
 Cause without my mommy dear my life would've been joke 
 Either locked up playin' dead and still slangin' dope but nope 
 The lord he had a plan for me 
 And with his help, my mother made a man of me 
 Didn't blindfold me to the world we was livin' in 
 Taught me how to save my little dividends 
 So when I graduated I'd have a little school money 
 But in the sixth grade I wanted to be the school dummy 
 And flunked outta school with the flag pole 
 And left my mother dear at home with a sad soul 
 Because my mother worked the fingers to the bone 
 'Cause we was alone, and me I bought an "F" home 
 My real pops he broke out with the style 
 So I respect my stepdad, for raisin' another nigga's child 
 So now we livin' comftable 
 Taught me the game and how to be responsible 
 But back then I couldn't see it 
 I wanted to be a grown man at fourteen so the kid's leavin' 
 And ended up in a big fight 
 And told me not to come home until I got my shit right 
 So now I'm livin' at my grandma's home 
 My grandma's strong, she's got nine kids of her own 
 And keepin' me ain't no big deal 
 But now that I'm much older I see just how the shit feels 
 Being kind-hearted, not wantin' to tell me no 
 Even though my grandfather just had a stroke 
 And now the money's low 
 And pretty soon a brother's gonna have ta go 
 Or either try to find a job so I can help out 
 I'm in the ghetto, I gots ta get myself out 
 And when I get out I gotta try to pave the way 
 So my family can have a better place to stay 
 I'm losin' all hope, a brother's fallin' short 
 I can't cope, so now I'm slangin' dope 
 And now my granny knows I'm doin' wrong 
 She just prayin' for me heavily 
 Take care of her grandson 
 And the lord must of heard her prayer 
 'Cause he made me get a grip 
 And got me on up outta there 
 I heard my mother say them streets is gonna kill ya 
 You couldn't have told me nothin' back then 
 But now I feel ya... 
 I'm eighteen, and now I'm havin' big fun 
 My baby's mother just had my first son 
 May eleven, I never will forget the day 
 A star's born, let's name him little Scarface 
 My first born and yo I'm a proud father 
 I gotta son, I gots ta be my son's father 
 And sellin dope ain't the way that I can get ahead 
 But what the hell, I gots ta keep my baby fed 
 I buy him milk, and pampers tryin' ta do my part 
 And he's my son, I gots ta try to make him hard 
 I buy him clothes, and jewelry not the Tonka toys 
 Because the Tonka toys will only punk my boy 
 And I don't want my son to look at life 
 Through a replica of reality tryin' to make it life-like 
 But yet and still I let my son be a kid 
 Just give him up the real, exactly like my momma did 
 So when he gets to be a man he'll appreciate 
 The game I gave him way back when he used to roller skate 
 And now my son is four years old 
 I really gots ta give the real and try to play the father's role 
 Because these years he'll remember most 
 So it's all about little Marcus and me becomin' close 
 But I got a buncha obstacles 
 If it ain't my line of work it's the girlies on my popsicle 
 Now everybody's got my baby 
 Wantin' to have their hands in my pocket tryin' to drive me crazy 
 "It's your daughter, don't she look like you?" 
 I just can't tell, why don't you take it to ma momma dukes 
 Because my mother knows the real deal 
 All these hoochies poppin' coochie tryin' to get a free meal 
 So now we in and outta court 
 Tryin' to get mo money, braggin' om the child support 
 Tellin' her friends that she's breakin' me 
 Now eveybody knows, that she was just fakin' G 
 Come to find out, the girl never had me 
 She's the baby's mother but me I ain't the baby's daddy 
 And biological tests done proved 
 You gotta get up off of me and go after the other dude 
 But now I finally got a real daughter 
 No need for the testin' 
 I know that I'm the baby's father 
 I heard my daddy say them hoes will try ta kill ya 
 You couldn't have told me nothin' back then 
 But now I feel ya... 
 I feel ya... 
 Now I'm twenty-two and finally got a grip on life 
 It's nineteen ninety-three, I put away my pocket knife 
 And got a bigger stick to fight with 
 I'm young and black so my choice ain't a nightstick 
 Because we livin' in a concentration set 
 And everyday, we face to face with death 
 I seen my homies go and come 
 And judgement day is just somethin' we can't run from 
 So I know my number's comin' up 
 So I gotta protect myself from suckers who be runnin' up 
 And even though I hate killin' off my own kind 
 I gotta be a man and as a man I'm a defend mine 
 My brother corners tryin' to keep the neighbourhood at peace 
 Don't fight each other, we gots ta stand and fight the beast 
 So united we stand but we gonna fall quick 
 Because we always tryin' to take another brother's shit 
 And the cops is in the same boat 
 Just because we comin' up quick they think we slang dope 
 They shootin' ta kill, they gats ain't sparkin' duds 
 They shot my long time partner Rudy in cold blood 
 And now the story's all twisted up 
 And if they gave the cop the chair 
 I really wouldn't give a fuck 
 Because he left my partner's family with memories 
 And after hearin' this I know you don't remember me 
 But yet in still I find it hard for me to stay in touch 
 I see his parents and then I started breakin' up 
 Because I know what you did was wrong 
 But you won't realize until you dead and gone 
 It ain't no justifiable homicide, you never gave a warning 
 You straight up shot him from behind 
 But all the cryin' in the world ain't gonna bring him back 
 You give a gat to a black he don't know how to act 
 But you gotta tell your story to the judge 
 Not the imitation judge, the judge that everybody loves 
 And if the man upstairs grants you forgiveness 
 Then in reality you took care of your business 
 But regardless I know you wanna kill me 
 But I ain't goin' out like dat 
 Ya feel me? 
 ...Yeah
