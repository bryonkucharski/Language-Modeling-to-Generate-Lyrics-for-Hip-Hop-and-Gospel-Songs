He wanted drama so I brought him pain 
 Wadadadang 
 Listen to my nine millimeter go bang 
 Out goes your brains; feel the motherfuckin terror 
 And you ain't felt the comin' of death like this ever 
 You paused; and now I got a Colt 45 
 Semiautomatic explodin between your eyes; surprise 
 You never thought your yesterdays would come back to haunt you 
 But believe me, I've come back to haunt you 
 I'm bout to bring your dog days to you mista 
 Cause rules in the streets you come off we come get ya 
 And hit ya'; and I done let you slide a few times 
 But eventually you gots to die in due time 
 Sunshine 
 Sunshine 
 Everybody needs 
 Sunshine 
 My life, my life, my life 
 His mama must've got the news 
 The little boy that she gave birth to was on of them niggas they pulled 
 Out the room 
 And all my other little homies stood shocked 
 While they watched my other little homie bleed non-stop 
 On the other side of sorrow is a father being torn 
 Apart by the sight of his son's lying in the morgue 
 He mourned 'cause now he got to deal with the fact 
 That his child is gone and tears can't bring him back 
 Turn on the TV and seen the unabomber 
 I flew to D.C., still they got no karma 
 And everybody say they think it's all gonna change 
 You paint me pictures, but they all look the same 
 Its strange, I'm standin in my own frame of thought 
 Remainin in the street game framin which I was taught 
 I was taught to always keep my eyes open wide 
 Cause in these streets you got to ride or you die 
 I've seen a child born and I've seen a man die 
 Can't live forever and I understand why 
 So when your time comes will you crawl or be brave 
 And in between judgement will you fall or be saved 
 Sunshine 
 Tears rolled town his face as he stared at his potna 
 With his chest full of holes and his head full of coppa 
 Broke his ass off something propa; he's in the morgue 
 With his brains in a shitbag and a toetag on-gone 
 This motherfucka must've thought he was a cat 
 And had nine lives but ended up on his back 
 And then the reaper came and took control of your mind 
 And you can't think you got a hole in your mind 
 You dyin' and can't nobody bring you out your coma 
 When this nigga brought the end and turned the lights out for ya 
 See ya and I wouldn't want to be in your position 
 Cause starin' the shaft of a strap and you the mission 
 Means one thing you let a mothafucka catch you on the sneak tip 
 And put your ass off in some deep shit; got the deep six 
 And everybody sad sendin' flowers to your ceremony 
 They lost their motherfuckin' homey 
 Damn Audi 5 on some dumb shit 
 And motherfuckers steady riskin their safety behind this dumb shit 
 But I refuse to give a nigga mine 
 I give a nigga nine
