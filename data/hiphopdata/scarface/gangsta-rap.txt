(Feat. Crooked I, Treach) 
 (Verse 1 - Scarface) 
 Now flip with a nigga, as we dip through the Dirty 
 Four-tops, spin out and bent up to thirty 
 I only ride for homies, 'cause hoes ain't worthy 
 Never put a bitch before your road doggs, ya heard me? 
 Plus, we do shit other rappers can't feel 
 Like, hangin' in the same spots we hung out for the deal 
 For real, the ghetto ain't a pop song, Cutty 
 The ghetto bodies get up, get out, and get nutty 
 And fool, do it till the death if you have too 
 Just get the fuck up off the cuts, 'fore they grab you 
 And have you doin' penitentary time 
 Got these rap cats thinkin', if they shit to lift rhymes 
 If you ain't in the streets, then nigga, 
 Stick to the balance, or get caught up 
 Tossed up, in this bitch, like a salad 
 Dedicated to my niggas out here stuck in the trap 
 I deliver it just like I live it, it ain't rap 
 Trust me 
 This is really that gangsta boggie (2 times) 
 That gangsta (4 times) 
 This is for the ballers 
 Gangsta rap! 
 What all the hoes love 
 Gangsta rap! 
 What you hop your 6-4 to? 
 Gangsta rap! 
 You can do what you want to 
 Gangsta rap! 
 Yeah, this is for the ballers 
 Gangsta rap! 
 What all the hoes love 
 Gangsta rap! 
 What you hop your 6-4 to? 
 Gangsta rap! 
 You can do what you want to 
 Gangsta rap! 
 (Verse 2 - Crooked I) 
 What did you fall in the spot? 
 You could say that they callin' a cop 
 I'm robbin' niggas, whether they ballin' or not 
 The Steven Segal of the block 
 Clock you with a pool ball in a sock 
 Pop you and crawl off in a drop 
 Dodger hatted-up 
 I'm fly as a shot when it hovers 
 A mix between Morpheous and Matrix 
 In rocket in colors 
 Tell me, can I... 
 Rip 'em up? This a jack 
 Keep them hands high 
 Stick 'em up 
 No Metropolis, stoppin' this apocalypse 
 You couldn't see this novelist 
 With positive and optimistic results from an optometrist 
 G shit, that we dreeze, ah! 
 I'm in that L... B... C... G 
 And we's, domes like two head soldiers 
 I'm ghetto enough to go platinum on bootleg versions, uh-huh! 
 Strapped, jumpin' outta the caravan 
 Kids turn the channel, now I'm finna smoke the camera man 
 (Verse 3 - Treach) 
 I got a question, what's the question? 
 "What is gangsta rap?" 
 Is it gangsta niggas that's rappin'? 
 Or rappin' niggas that act? 
 I'll tell you what, gangsta rap ain't even force 
 It ain't bangin' on wax 
 With dirty backs 
 Gettin' slapped at The Source 
 Hmmph, comin' in with your toes pointed out 
 Runnin' quicker than the bitches and the hoes runnin' out 
 Don't be pussy and shoot my kids 
 The set trip, next shit 
 And I'll make it out, to be East and West shit 
 I took a ???, then bless it 
 Manhandle the message 
 Double my records, Death Row the best shit 
 Built in L.A.! 
 You lay, then pay 
 Still ??? in ??? 
 You're laid out the same day 
 This is really that gangsta boggie (2 times) 
 That gangsta (4 times) 
 (Chorus - 2 times)
