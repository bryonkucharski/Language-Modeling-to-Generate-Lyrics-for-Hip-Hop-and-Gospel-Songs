Yes. And everybody yes, yes, yes. (Check it.) 
 I don't like to start verses with I, you know but um... 
 (I) 
 Well there's no I in team, but there's an 'I' in win. 
 And every guy wanna win, so folks is eying him. 
 The I in pride: They say pride puts the 'I' in sin. 
 Put self at the center, I and 'I' come in. 
 'Cause I am imperfect; none of us is iron men. 
 Please, be my third eye when the light gets dim. 
 Even my story's not mine. Where do I begin? 
 Not with I. I'm reminded, see the 'I' in him 
 In my enemy, especially, him and I are twins. 
 I've got to love him as I love I, him and I are kin. 
 Take the thing out of my own eye then see if the word is where the world begin. 
 And at the end of the word friend is where I end and all them become I and I them. 
 So who am I then? Just dust in the wind with a pen and a grin. I'm going in. 
 I'm going in. 
 Like yes. 
 We all in agreement 
 And if you hear the song and you feel it 
 Put your palms to the ceiling 
 Like yes, yes and all my people like yes 
 It go: yes 
 We all in agreement 
 And if you hear the song and you feel it 
 Put your palms to the ceiling 
 Like yes, yes and all my people like yes. 
 Huh 
 (Myself) 
 What can I say for myself. Where I'm at is where I stationed myself. 
 So I'm grateful, I do OK for myself. 
 I wanna do better for y'all, I'm afraid of myself. 
 God said: you trust me. Now have some faith in yourself. 
 When I made my first record I would say to myself: 
 'I'm glad to share this. I don't just want to play for myself.' 
 The thing with rapping is it helps me get away from myself. 
 Put these awesome feelings out so they don't stay on the shelf. 
 Stay in my soul 'cause I find the more I stay to myself 
 The less I find the real me the more I stray from myself 
 And can't relate to no one else. I don't have to make a way for myself. 
 Just make my thoughts point away from myself. 
 And what else 
 Like yes. 
 We all in agreement 
 And if you hear the song and you feel it 
 Put your palms to the ceiling 
 Like yes, yes and all my people like yes 
 It go: yes 
 We all in agreement 
 And if you hear the song and you feel it 
 Put your palms to the ceiling 
 Like yes, yes and all my people like yes. 
 Everybody like 
 (We) 
 And we are greater than the sum of us 
 All greater than some of us greater than each piece apart 
 We are a body an army greater than any single art piece and love in our hearts 
 And we are who we are behind doors in secret. 
 In the deep depths of recesses we aren't free yet. 
 We are how we treat our sick folk and widows 
 Rich with broken hearts broken and crippled the soul is weak. 
 We are not what we eat, but what comes out of our mouths when we speak 
 Most of y'all don't speak truth. Can't play me playboy I'm no kid I don't play Wii 
 We are parents cherished proud and embarrassed. 
 We've come a long way, but we're still not there yet 
 And we don't always get along, me, myself, and I, when we do 
 We in tune like the song. 
 Singing 
 Like yes. 
 We all in agreement 
 And if you hear the song and you feel it 
 Put your palms to the ceiling 
 Like yes, yes and all my people like yes 
 It go: yes 
 We all in agreement 
 And if you hear the song and you feel it 
 Put your palms to the ceiling 
 Like yes, yes and all my people like yes.
