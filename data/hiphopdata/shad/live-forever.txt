The time will come when we are all condemned for what we've done 
 The time will come 
 I say the times begun to pay for our crimes no time to run 
 It's sundown these days are the final ones 
 Looking dumbfounded staring in the eye of a gun 
 And we all scared to die we all fear the Paul Bearer 
 All scared to cry we all fear our salt tears 
 But why were we living so miserable 
 Can't get along why is forgiving so difficult 
 Why we live alone what we living for is critical 
 Someone give some hope that's breath for our living souls 
 Even if your physical can't breathe stand up and lead 
 Me and my band of brothers advance under siege 
 Move towards the future the commander and chief 
 Plant a flag on this soul call if land of the free 
 Every day both rich and poor wonder what we living for 
 We're gonna live forever 
 What we gonna live for 
 We're gonna live forever 
 What we gonna live for 
 We're gonna live forever 
 What we gonna live for 
 We're gonna live forever 
 What we gonna live for 
 We're gonna live 
 We're gonna live 
 You never know how your legends gonna grow later 
 When we go it's our ghost that they are so afraid of 
 I try to flow greater cause most conscience sold food for thoughts 
 Like tofu no flavor 
 So when I roll through it's so smooth like a pro skater 
 Or a boat cruise bringing change toll booth 
 Player thought they told you I'm old school 
 Student of the game let me show you a whole new grade up 
 All my single ladies here's a couple lines 
 Love takes two people love one mind 
 Here's one year if you give it six months 
 You only live once this is double time 
 Essentially bring the energy of Busta Rhymes 
 So it doesn't die like Curtis on touch the sky 
 And when the smoke finally clears we're gonna rise above the ash 
 We're gonna live 
 We're gonna live 
 We're gonna live forever 
 What we gonna live for 
 We're gonna live forever 
 What we gonna live for 
 We're gonna live forever 
 What we gonna live for 
 We're gonna live forever 
 What we gonna live for 
 We're gonna live 
 We're gonna live 
 Like this 
 I can't sweat trying to make the coolest impression 
 Trying to get power is a foolish obsession 
 Why use talent as a tool for oppression 
 A real king ain't got to rule with a weapon 
 Dog what if we went to school for possession instead of jail 
 They say to stop the crazy talk Shad we never will 
 I guess I still believe love can never fail 
 Cross eyes on heaven looking crazy as hell 
 Maybe I dwell too much on legacy destiny 
 Like I could ever read what's on the headstone ahead of me 
 But in my head I see we are carving the letters 
 Everyday that thought makes me live for the better 
 The truth comes out but it starts at the center 
 The heart of the matter is the matter of the heart 
 The hearts made of matter that you can't measure 
 That matters beyond measure like light when it travels in the dark
