Even if they don't seem what they oughta be 
 I just let it go down 
 Now I can make 'em see to the heart of me (y'all know me) 
 And I let it go down 
 If they don't seem what they oughta be 
 I just let it go down 
 I can make 'em see to the heart of me (y'all know me) 
 And I let it go down 
 (How should I begin, um..) 
 What's a winner? What's this bitterness? 
 It's crazy how we fight like Springer 
 No Fight Night, it's not a game (give'r) 
 I'm a globetrotter but not a baller or ball-spinner 
 On this big ball spinning up on God's tall fingers 
 All year, aw yeah, spring, summer, fall, winter 
 Remembering the saint that remembered we're all sinners 
 Let my people go! (uh Pharaoh they're talking to us) 
 Rosa's still seated, saying "please don't get off of the bus" 
 It's history, never her story and prophets get crushed 
 Tough topics get hushed and life is often unjust 
 I forget... then I remember to remember 
 On the darkest days, the sun is still shining in December 
 Being broke, yeah that's hard, but that legal ain't always tender 
 I'm Hakeem's team focused with my dream in the center, let's move 
 Even if they don't seem what they oughta be 
 I just let it go down 
 Now I can make 'em see to the heart of me (y'all know me) 
 And I let it go down 
 If they don't seem what they oughta be 
 I just let it go down 
 I can make 'em see to the heart of me (y'all know me) 
 And I let it go down 
 Now I'm just trying to make it do what it should (never!) 
 Can Wesley Snipes get a Leslie Feist, what's good? 
 I'm on a little win streak yo 
 Jeremy Linnin', Tim Tebow 
 How many them negro men can spend c-notes? 
 Love be infinito, bring me that passion, that black Jim Caviezel 
 I'm trying to be acting like he's really coming back in the sequel 
 Really rap for the people 
 We can do this music for half of the ego but 
 Cats been gassed before Shad added diesel fuel 
 To fire but one strike to the match can be lethal 
 They say a bit of the fast life's addictive 
 As a hit from a crack pipe 
 The trap's, like, hidden like slipping that night on some black ice 
 Makes people backbite, even backstab best friends with a jackknife 
 B I'm in that fight, given miserable odds, fighting with self 
 In a scrap between business and art 
 I been given some scars, can't give in, still giving 'em bars 
 Spit from the heart and I'll rip 'em apart 
 Even if they don't seem what they oughta be 
 I just let it go down 
 Now I can make 'em see to the heart of me (y'all know me) 
 And I let it go down 
 If they don't seem what they oughta be 
 I just let it go down 
 I can make 'em see to the heart of me (y'all know me) 
 And I let it go down
