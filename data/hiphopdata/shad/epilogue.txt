But really I'm sick of rapping, but really I miss the passion 
 You feel me, I miss the scene, you feel me, I miss the action 
 I miss touring, miss America, miss the pageant 
 I'm still married to that dame though the game is Mrs. Jackson to me 
 Rappers love talking this epic 
 When we talk of our exit from showbiz and nobody noticed we left it 
 Was hedging bets at the school of Texas, hold them Rolexes 
 And Lexuses, just a second, I got a test, but I'm blessed 
 I got to live and learn, literally, did a term 
 Then went to gig and earn, urn, just let it burn 
 Words I could grow-op, no, I don't mean grow pot 
 I mean getting that dope though, I still gotta grow lots 
 Live real stories, grow plots, they wanted more crops 
 And grow guap and you find some botox, robots to co-op 
 But y'all know me, don't stop, I just go off 
 I stay on point for the heads, this cut's a mohawk, uh 
 For heads that's headstrong, uh, and heads with dreads on 
 And white corn rows although that's dead wrong 
 But listen, this is all inclusive, for all humans, just for y'all amusement 
 Music for the blue-collared dudes and all the college students 
 I'm Paul Wall in '05 and I'm car pollution 
 And I'm James Harden hooping, all meaning I'm a problem Houston 
 A constant nuisance, I cause confusion 
 Hold on, this song's as long as the constitution 
 It's just that I've got a lot of thoughts that are hard to explain 
 I'm trying to try a little tender but I'm hard in the brain 
 Hard headed thoughts darkened and charred in the flame 
 I'm talking black, pardon the slang 
 But the flame is like Flocka, young man always gotta go hard in the paint 
 We talk foul on offensive, they call charge in the game 
 But even activists targeting Targets and chain stores 
 They get chained to the same war, same arms taking aim 
 Arm leg leg arm head, we all the same 
 One race feeling safe when we start in our lanes 
 On our march till that gun spark, reminds us of young scars 
 Makes us all start to run, far from the pain 
 So we take off and we hide and we harbor the shame 
 And as we grow older, damn, it only gets harder to change 
 It's getting heavy, I don't wanna let my people down 
 I'll fight with evil within until I'm beneath the ground 
 Sleeping sound, that's my deepest vow 
 Till I take my deepest bow, I'll keep reaching out through these speakers 
 Now, Gary told me my album should be called "Food Court" 
 'Cause I only talk about food, justice, and hoop scores 
 Put on my Jordan's this morning without a shoe horn 
 Played a couple games, then debated the use of brute force 
 Versus new forms of abuse to make us produce more 
 Over cold pizza and a lukewarm 2-4 
 The poor gotta eat, so like first ball we shoot for it 
 I'm just trying to remember that life is too short 
 Every second's precious, let's stay up like due north of New York 
 Where my homegirl is trying to quit with the Newport's 
 And my dude's trying to keep the food portions down to two courses 
 I'm trying to build with a lady and maybe move towards forming a team 
 That's my last reference to sports 
 I promise I'm through, these women are getting too bored 
 Calling this dude-core 
 Hold-on, uh 
 Just keep it going 
 Yeah, the last time I was rocking this 
 I was rocking in a Diamond tee 
 Rhyming like Rawkus would sign him 
 But dreaming of rocking that diamond, Roc-A-Fella 
 Before Barack was presiding over the oval office to go to Iraq 
 I was grinding and I still love it, up in front of the public 
 Juggling subjects in couplets, it's funny my stomach plummets 
 Right before every time but then I'm fine once them drums hit 
 Drum sticks in buckets, backstage with subway Subwiches 
 Man I'm lucky as what, this what I do for the ducats 
 No soul sucking for pay stubs I'm nobody's puppet 
 Now I'm buzzing 'cause this stuff is in my blood like an IV 
 But just 'cause I love it, it's not my ID 
 I mean I'm wrapped in these rhyme schemes 
 And I rap to define me but rap doesn't define me 
 Trust that I'll be fine when the shine leaves 
 Dudes used to say, "would you rhyme please?!" 
 They had to push me to start like they couldn't find keys 
 Now I'm regarded the most rewinded Rwandese 
 London-born but not that one renowned for the grime scene 
 Uh, yeah 
 Check it out! 
 I'm sending this one to my fam and my old friends 
 And fans that follow all the tweets that I don't send 
 My man G's on the net, no goaltend 
 My plan B I just left, 'cause I goes in 
 I'm into 30 for 30 docs and 30 Rock 
 Why? 'Cause I'm 30 and 'cause I'm kinda of a nerdy jock 
 I remember before Jigga made 30 hot 
 And I still front on Justin a little 'cause of that dirty pop 
 I had CeeLo on cassette back when he would rap 
 Sitting up in my room with that Moesha track 
 That was back when North America made cars 
 Now inner cities look like outer space, we only make stars 
 I remember we didn't care when we ate carbs 
 I remember dreaming of that day we would take charge 
 I'm seeing the seeds of future change right now in the present 
 As we work in our fields here grounding the message 
 In real life lessons, getting right down to the essence 
 Then we water that like a fountain when we're counting our blessings 
 Sharing the hope of our hearts and the doubts and the questions 
 See the seeds sprout into trees that leave thousands of fresh ones 
 Haven't got there yet but I've found some direction 
 I'm not a catholic but these tracks is the sound of confession 
 It's like I said 'em then heaven sent down a post card 
 Over a large ocean of doubt via Coast Guardian angel to say we're ok 
 We've all broke hearts, groped parts, fought and hurt, drank and smoked darts 
 We're all victims, we're all innocent, no charge 
 You're free to be who you are, now go and don't harm 
 The world's so starved for you being unique 
 That's cliche but it often is with the truth, see 
 It's nothing too deep and it's nothing new, we all knew it as youth 
 Seems we just forgot as soon as we grew a few feet 
 That's why I like to say remember to remember 
 That's why I like to play my fingers on that Fender 
 And that's why I write and play to try to find the light of day 
 In these dark winter nights and bravely bring it to the centre 
 Still some say it's hood nonsense, no good conscience 
 They got it twisted, it's hood conscious and good nonsense 
 But check the comments, some supporters got enough hate 
 Some fans don't post "I love Shad" they just say "F... Drake" 
 I got no problems with Drizzy of course 
 I'm not vexed, I can't cop what Drizzy affords 
 I'm all good, I even got to give to the poor 
 And TO knows I'm like a Benz in the city of Fords (Rob) 
 I'm thinking they're bored with the backpacking like, "is he done yet?" 
 They waiting on that hit like Phil Collins with the drum set 
 In the air tonight, I'm heavy as two tonnes, heads 
 Sleeping on the kid, I'm breaking down they bunk beds 
 And raising hell like Rev Run said 
 Watch him stalk his prey and walk this way slow as the undead 
 I keep it 100 till sunset, till there's not one breath in my lungs left 
 The undisputed number one-esque 
 Nah this is a new act called sinner and saint 
 Where the singer covers inner pain with glitter and paint 
 And delivers his statements with wit and with vigour and haste 
 They say the entertainer's like Cedric, except thinner and great 
 I'm playing, I'm not a comedy king 
 Obviously Rap fathered me sorta like Pop's rap on Common's Be 
 My policy's quality over quantity, real... 
 Ah, hmm 
 Almost had it, almost had it 
 My policy's quality over quantity 
 Real girls over drama queens, real world over college dean 
 Philosophies honesty over shock, real thoughts over knocking beats 
 Real talk, it's over when I drop the beat 
 Yeah, that's good
