Bye-bye Miss American Pie 
 Drove a block to that shop with the liquor inside 
 Singing "Gin and Juice", drinking whiskey and rye 
 Thinking "This'll be the day that I..." 
 The night the music died 
 There were flashes of massive plane and stock crashes 
 Flower baskets and caskets 
 A.I.G. and B.I.G. and C.I.G.-arette ashes 
 From that burned down Baptist Church 
 Where little black fists never got raised 
 In the light of today's practice, supposed post-blackness 
 The night the music died we burned all the classics 
 On to one last disc of bright blue plastic 
 Johnny Cash hits and a rapper slash actress 
 More powerful than two Cleopatras 
 The night the music died, all so tragic 
 Then something else happened and we all got distracted 
 Something so dramatic for however long it lasted 
 We were saddened then ecstatic, saying Michael 
 Then imagine, then... 
 Bye-bye Miss American Pie 
 Miseducated by these terrible lies 
 Age 27, with a wink in her eyes 
 Singing "This'll be the day that I die" 
 She cried "I'm bored!", said "Yeah you're starting to bore us" 
 Never gone this long without a chorus 
 The night the music died we expected a performance 
 We waited, the parade never came around our corners 
 The coroners report was a song by a foreigner 
 A man who learned the slang before he ever crossed the boarder 
 He learned all he knew from off a four track recorder 
 "Don't mourn her" he said "Life should be four minutes or shorter" he's singing... 
 Bye-bye Miss American Pie 
 Took a cab to the lab but it didn't arrive 
 Shotgun blast, both hands to the sky 
 Singing "This'll be the day that I..." 
 Bye-bye Miss American Pie 
 One time at Band Camp, drove this Trans Am, she could fly 
 Traded her for a foreign car, kept in storage, parked 
 Till the tires got deflated, no air, like Jordin Sparks 
 Stripped and sold for her parts like porn stars 
 To keep shades worn in the dark, like Corey Hart 
 "What she got under the hood?", Let's take a look-see 
 What's going on in the hood? What's good B? 
 Well what seems good ain't always good 
 Even what's really good ain't all that it could be 
 I find they game too bush-league 
 They rhymes is lame, My mind's the same a Usain's footspeed 
 And that pushed me off the beaten trail 
 Like a runaway slave on some underground VIA Rail 
 'Cause we still feel them beats but I don't mean Pharrell 
 I mean we still feel them beats, we were beaten well 
 I mean look how we still scared to be ourselves 
 Can't speak out and I don't mean that we need a cell 
 And by cell I don't mean a jail, I mean hell 
 We locked up and these banks keep receiving bail 
 I don't mean to speak this real but like damn 
 I don't mean to sound depressed but I am 
 The night the music died it slept with a fan 
 Put her breasts in his hands and said "Never sing for less than a grand", bam 
 Bye-bye Miss American Pie 
 Drove a block to that shop with the liquor inside 
 Singing "Gin and Juice", drinking whiskey and rye 
 Singing "This'll be the day that I..." 
 Bye-bye Miss American Pie 
 Drove my Chevy to the levee, nope, guess the levee broke 
 This'll be the day that I die, guess you never know 
 Dropping acid rain from the sky in a deadly dose 
 The night the music died they played something beautiful 
 To drown out the rain and the refrain from the funeral 
 Look, Wayne's in the studio and the Saints win the Super Bowl 
 But it's a different crowd this time around in that Superdome 
 Storm's brewing, I can feel something's not right 
 Writing Old Prince lyrics, something 'bout pop life 
 Everybody need a thrill, some entertainment 
 Some Richard Pryor, Usher Raymond 
 No blaming all the products of the products 
 Made of pop cans and Pop-Tarts and pop charts and all stars 
 And doll parts and stock cars and Walmarts with shop carts 
 And ballparks with playoffs and day jobs with layoffs between faded soft 
 And the night the music died nobody investigated it 
 Just another one of us laying on the Vegas Strip 
 They close the casket and the case up quick 
 Guess they figured it was gang related and never gave a shh... 
 Bye-bye Miss American Pie 
 If we've got good elections oh ho 
 And we keep our confessions oh ho 
 And we got good connections oh ho 
 And we got good corrections oh ho 
 America don't need Jesus 
 The future is here 
 America don't need Jesus 
 The future is here 
 If we've got all the weapons oh ho 
 Aimed in all directions oh ho 
 And we've got good professions oh ho 
 And we've got good erections oh ho 
 America don't need Jesus 
 The future is here 
 America don't need Jesus 
 The future is here 
 The future is here 
 The future is here 
 The future is here 
 The future is here 
 The future is here 
 The future is here 
 The future is here
