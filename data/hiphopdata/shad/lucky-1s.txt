(Verse 1: Shad) 
 I can't derail I train hard then relax on tracks 
 Keep the brain sharp hitting like an axe on wax 
 Axe never touch trees meaning I don't puff weed 
 But I hope to plant my seeds before I must leave 
 Believing that hope grows even in the stone cold 
 Bitter and bleak old souls sold like its antique 
 Road show except for so damn cheap 
 They preach the new science hone the program sheep 
 But they won't find us, it's hide and go seek 
 To control minds like gold mines in Mozambique 
 Where the folks can't eat so I stroll to slow jam beat 
 Slow dancing life's no grand prix 
 No race no pace car and there is no shortcuts 
 And no one's that special and there ain't no short bus 
 The core of us are simple, but dignified 
 We don't simply live to die 
 Look through the inner eye in the sky 
 (Verse 2: Shad) 
 Now I'm a cynic but I try to keep my heart warm 
 Human beings start war, but I believe in peace even for Darfur 
 From hardcore to humor to here 
 Where we stare in confusion at a future so near 
 Got to take the spec out of your eye to see clear 
 And if I'm gonna point fingers better point them at the mirror 
 Reflections I reflect on lessons of my 26th year 
 Erecting this next song here 
 See you all know the drill like Exxon 
 I guess wrong moves is experience like stairs to step on (yeah) 
 And I don't talk biz and I don't talk down 
 No kids talk, but I don't talk big 
 Getting gassed like pop fizz off of pop hits 
 I ain't got to say real talk because all my talk is 
 Pop quiz: Who can define love? 
 So many blind plus they can't feel they'll never find us... 
 (Verse 3: Kamau) 
 My folks love me I feel lucky they all love me 
 But feel funny inside of world that is real ugly 
 God save us this hard labour is breaking backs 
 In the sands of time every step we making tracks 
 The hour glass is lasting faster than the hour last 
 Or so it seems more dreams they will come to pass 
 And nightmares they flare up like the flames erupt 
 The same dream I used to live now I gave it up 
 And I've been saving up but money doesn't come quick 
 Comes and goes like the daylight one shift 
 And one sip of the well water it makes us live 
 Forever we still here whether we take or give 
 And its survival of the fittest by the thinnest thread 
 When father time moves the minutes what is in his head 
 Not even in control of what we must become 
 But not far so I guess we are the lucky ones
