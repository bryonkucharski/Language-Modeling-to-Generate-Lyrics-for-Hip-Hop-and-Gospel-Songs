Picture life etched in stone 
 Life sketched in poems 
 On sidewalks in dry chalk next to homes 
 Picture all you've left alone 
 And kept in reflections shown 
 Your dome sketched in subjective tones 
 Picture life on a sidewalk 
 Frame it - so all view 
 All you've ever felt 
 Try to name it - its called you 
 Picture it 
 In the space between steps 
 It's the grace between breaths 
 And the message in this make-believe text 
 Picture ...

 God exhaled 
 The moon shivered in a blue river 
 Stardust fell 
 Through space released and gave its peace 
 To a man in his place beneath 
 Graciously as he laid asleep 
 Draped in sheets 
 With his honest wife 
 In the gold days of his old age 
 And on this nice August night 
 His soul raised 
 He saw this light - the calmest bright - 
 Like Coldplay, it was all yellow 
 And in its gold rays, he saw his plight 
 As it showed him the youth that he'd forgot about 
 Like how he block the spout on his house's hose 
 And not let the water out 
 He thought it out and wondered 
 How he'd remembered it all? 
 How younger he'd enter the halls 
 When summer surrendered the fall 
 Then he wondered was his life through? 
 In slumber under this bright moon? 
 Like skies after thunder, the light grew 
 And more from the limitless stash of images flashed 
 And poured from the reservoir to mimic his past 
 He saw himself with his wife growing old 
 His children's lives 
 He filled with pride as the light showed his soul 
 Then it's brilliance died ... 
 V-2 
 And it was dead black in his eyes 
 A voice said that it was time 
 But he was steadfast in his mind 
 So he said back in reply 
 "Please! Seeing my life like this 
 It made me think 
 I could state succinctly everything life is 
 If you gave me ink 
 And I could maybe print every speech and thought 
 And release my plot on these streets I've walked 
 With a piece of chalk 
 To paint the sharpest image of a heart 
 'Cause as much as art can mimic 
 Nothing's as real as a life told from start to finish" 
 Suddenly the man awoke with a violent cry 
 That strangely didn't seem to disturb the silent sky 
 His wife was still beside him under the blankets enclosed 
 And when he looked up at the clock he saw the hands in it froze 
 So the man just arose, put his hands to the roads 
 And began to compose the most candid of prose... 
 V-3 
 So he wrote every quote spoken 
 And left every breath kept 
 Sketched in the next step of concrete 
 Then Death crept and lead him to his bed 
 As the sun began to rise 
 He titled his surprise 
 "The Story of the Man that Died" 
 Then his wife and the townsfolk awoke and were shocked 
 First by his passing, but then by what he wrote with his chalk 
 They got the roads blocked by a flock of postmen and cops 
 He wrote from his lot to the edge of town close to the docks 
 Where he used to watch the boats and often joked with his pops 
 His folks had not long ago passed and now both with him walk 
 People came from everywhere 
 They read the story through for days 
 It wasn't nothing new or strange 
 Still they were moved and amazed 
 It wasn't the places he'd been or the people he'd met 
 It was the spaces between and the secrets he'd kept 
 They wept joyfully, for the greatest story no one told 
 Was just the story of an ordinary man growing old 
 Picture life etched in stone 
 Life sketched in poems 
 On sidewalks in dry chalk next to homes 
 Picture all you've left alone 
 And kept in reflections shown 
 Your dome sketched in subjective tones 
 Picture life on a sidewalk 
 Frame it - so all view 
 All you've ever felt 
 Try to name it - its called you 
 Picture it 
 In the space between steps 
 It's the grace between breaths 
 And the message in this make-believe text
