And you would always say wait till I'm the unsigned hype 
 The best ten freshman, the new star 
 Trekking with the next gen 
 The next gem the next big thing on planet rock 
 Get the guap, prosper and live long 
 When you're Kirk girls wanna cling on 
 Wanna get beamed up, wanna put some bling on 
 Same old song except they sing wrong 
 Baby if you liked it then you should have put your blackberry ring on 
 Now he's outer space but she's not out of mind 
 Deanna Troi sends her eons out of time 
 He paints the wrong picture, she's drawn out of line 
 Says she's gone and he says that she left without a sign 
 He says "Whatever, I'm better without a dime" 
 He tells her "Good thing that I pegged you around the nine" 
 She laughs and says he's never clever without a rhyme

 She says "It's different for a girl turning 30" 
 He says "Is that a crack about me not maturing? 
 'Cause I'm just deferring the term, I'll be back in the spring 
 I'm just waiting for my break, got the cast in a sling" 
 He says "The queen is the back of her king" 
 But she's mad at her lack of a ring 
 She says "It better get bought 
 Quit playing games, you getting an ex off that Xbox 
 I love you boy but I need a man Peter Pan 
 Syndrome, ain't even been home to meet the fam 
 You could barely feed the plants, you can hardly cook a bowl of cereal 
 It's not cute in the evening eating these Cheerios" 
 He says "Oh here we go", she says "But hear me though 
 Baby I don't care that you're lyrical 
 And why you always talking bout Star Wars? Whatever, Star Trek 
 I ain't even mad you ain't a star yet"
