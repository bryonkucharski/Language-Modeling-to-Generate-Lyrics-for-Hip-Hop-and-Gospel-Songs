Yeah, I forget so often, God, no wonder I feel lost 
 When I forget where I came from or how I got past 
 Now we ain't young, can't play dumb, the fun and games is done 
 Damn man, it's a strange one 
 Reverend what you say, run, walk this way 
 By the light of the same sun, that's in the sky where the rain's from 
 But the clouds make it hard to see him 
 He's in my brother I discovered that it's not that hard to be him 
 I just lose him in the P.M., thinking if I had a B.M 
 I could hang with Mona Lisas like a piece in a museum 
 Uh, human beings 
 Deep inside we decide if we free men

 You may have to forgive him forever 
 Everyday they say life can make you bitter or better 
 I say "Hey, sacred or not it's all that we got" 
 Love is what it is, or maybe not what you thought 
 Woke up one morning started talking to pops 
 He said "There's lots that you've learned but a lot you forgot 
 More often than not you don't got to be taught 
 Just remember to remember how you got to the spot that's hot" 
 I'm happy and healthy and dreaming and dying 
 I'm loving and lonely and tired of trying 
 I'm fall and faded and failing with flying 
 Colours fumbling forward facing sky 
 My aim's to entertain and inspire 
 Walk through the rain and the fire, pay bills keep sane and retire 
 From the game with a name that's admired 
 Seeing the stars and aiming higher

 Yeah

 Break it down like this... 
 (I mean it now) 
 Now I ain't ever really been one for image 
 Ain't trying to fool the public with some stunts and gimmicks 
 Guys gravitate to blunts and Guinness to get the courage to fight the urge 
 In 'em, not to succumb to timidness 
 And this world is fully overrun with mimics 
 With a penchant for overexposing guns and women 
 Few deals, funds is limited, folks front to get in the game 
 That ain't kind, everyone's a critic 
 But this ain't a race to win, it's a run to finish 
 And as long as I got breath in my lungs to end it 
 The enemy isn't the flesh and blood thugs and cynics 
 We fighting fear and pride for the love within us

 Break it down, the poor struggle with needs 
 The rich struggle with greed, this camel struggle to squeeze 
 Through the eye of a needle, some eyes struggle to see 
 But we all struggle for freedom 
 Instead of freeing each other by letting ourselves be 
 Yeah, and it never ends 
 We only feel better when we feel like we're better than 
 Clever men and our violence 
 Silence is when we shoot from the lip too quiet 
 Then we talk non-violence and stay silent when it suits 
 Really, it's all violence at the root 
 The same James Wilks in the booth, but tyrants aren't tyrants in the group 
 Who started the shooting? Who knows? 
 We were all just born inside of this truth 
 Taught to shoot as youth, taught as just humans being human 
 But the truth is the truth is bulletproof
