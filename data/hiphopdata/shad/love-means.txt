Check it, I was thinking 'bout you 
 But I chose to write to God instead, met on the page and broke bread 
 Sometimes my heart it is leaden, memories I thought I let forget 
 Overestimated power of regret I guess 
 I planted seeds and watered in the darkness 
 I let a tree blossom in the bottom recesses 
 And yet I often wonder how I got into this mess 
 Instead of one love it's two lives conflict 
 Interested parties catch eyes, cats lie fast 
 Pick your poison like a blood anointing over sins past 
 It can happen when yesterday collides with the present 
 Like scratch that I'm not past that, I'm confessing 
 I can pass that class, I'd rather not if you're the lesson 
 I would take that punishment, risk losing my blessing 
 Going crazy over something maybe not be in the essence 
 What it seems to me, it seems to me polyamory beckons 
 And I get it, I get why you could love her and me 
 Love never claimed exclusivity it is free 
 And neither clarity, I wrote this for God to see 
 But he knew I was gonna do what I did before me 
 And I don't regret a thing, perfect symmetry 
 Felt like the way the king intended us to be 
 So there's no apologies, no rewinding 
 I would do it all again to show 'em what love means 
 (Love means) 
 Some things we're too in to figure out 
 (Love means) 
 I'm just trynna be fine without knowing it all

 I told me that I 
 Like to write when it's late and I'm sleep deprived 
 That's when I'm more inclined to joke and just speak my mind 
 As far as what love means well I can read a line 
 From the dictionary, but I think I need to redefine 
 I need to live it to know it 
 That means I gotta give it and let it be given back to grow it 
 I gotta sow it to get it, like really get it, I gotta show it 
 Not just talk about it like a lot of poets 
 A.K.A. moi, you see my day job's 
 Talking this romantic philosophic, je ne sais quoi 
 And as a lyricist, in my experience 
 Love's kind of bugged cause my fears and embarrassments 
 This music's who I always had to share it with 
 It's like a man that's in love with his therapist 
 And the affair is a lie but I'm scared 
 Cause to truly care and be cared for bares a risk 
 I wake up and I ask God for help 
 Then go online if my last song was felt 
 I forget about the pain, I'm gassed on myself 
 And the goblins in the closet go back on the shelf 
 Tryna figure what love means 
 (Love means)

 Understanding, being fully understood, wonderful, pain, keeping no record of wrong, lies, purity, having no fear, all you need, my satisfaction is meeting your needs, loyalty, true freedom, mine, trust, yours, ours, satisfaction, true freedom, praying for your enemies, a safe space to make mistakes 
 Love means, check it out yeah 
 Love always has hope for another day 
 Love is grace, love is patient, even when it doesn't wanna stay 
 It doesn't run away, like "andale", it perseveres and suffers pain 
 And doesn't suffocate though it holds tight, and it doesn't change 
 Though some would say that love is vain 
 And it's just a game for the young ones on lovers lane 
 Or just the chemistry of the brain 
 Just science, you know something sane 
 But you know that love is strange and wild and heartbreaking and unexplained 
 Love is dangerous as a dark street, tuck your chain 
 Our world's going up in flames 
 Still love isn't violent, that said it's nothing safe 
 'Cause it means standing up to hate 
 So love is costly but love can save and I'm of the faith 
 But "love your neighbor" isn't a Christian or Muslim phrase 
 No one owns it as some brothers claim 
 From the pulpit or from the stage and in the coming age 
 I hope we'll see it as gay, straight and colorless 
 Sometimes we all feel motherless above the grave 
 But it's in death and new life when love is made 
 It's when you're unashamed and finally unafraid 
 When you confront the pain 
 Face death and you'll see in the end only love remains
