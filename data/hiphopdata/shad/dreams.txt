Dreams... dreams... 
 We think till we're emotional 
 Then drink until we're sociable again 
 This whole century is sensory overload 
 Stay the night, roam the globe 
 We go from low to overdose back to comatose 
 Brightest lights, coldest roads 
 My generation is a rose that's grown 
 From concrete rubble under a broken home 
 In a busy city where we've never felt so alone 
 Let's get outta here baby, Barry Bonds 
 I know we've both got baggage, I hope they're carry-ons 
 Same age as pops he married moms 
 Pipe dreams, cherry bombs blow up... gone 
 Grow up, achieve, succeed 
 You know that you've arrived when you always gotta leave 
 And you're up all night 'cause you're living all your dreams 
 The fantasy: a black room, one mirror 
 The man I see: inside of the vanity, can't believe 
 That he can't believe anymore, in any force 
 Stronger than a bombshell blonde that's twenty-four 
 Room had many doors - how to choose? 
 He said the echo in the space made him sound confused 
 And there's mirrors all around, 100,000 views 
 Become 1000 faces in the now crowded room 
 Loud music all around and booze and the sound of youth 
 They got advanced because they only know how to move 
 We think till we're emotional 
 Then drink until we're sociable again 
 This whole century is sensory overload
