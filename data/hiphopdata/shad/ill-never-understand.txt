(Bernadette) 
 The killers 
 You've invaded my nights 
 Singing your haunting lullaby 
 Drowning other voices 
 Choking 
 Suffocating 
 Numbing 
 Sending me to sleep 
 You've awakened me many mornings 
 Like an unexpected alarm 
 Shattering my dreams 
 Confusing 
 Terrorizing 
 Traumatizing 
 I've talked to you in tears and anger 
 Spat on you in rage 
 Whispered to you in sorrow 
 Tied you in chains 
 Thrown you in jail 
 I've pulled you out 
 Asked you many questions 
 Knowing there would be no answers... 
 (Shad) 
 I'll never understand how flesh being torn apart feels 
 Or how after all this suffering a heart heals 
 On the rich green fields where they killed old and young 
 Cold and numb, under the light of a golden sun 
 It still stuns, tell me what possesses man 
 To, in anger, raise his hand? 
 I'll never understand... 
 (Bernadette) 
 I tied you in chains 
 Again and again, round and round 
 Until the chains, in my dizziness 
 Bound me to you 
 You and I becoming one! 
 Bound by the chains of hate 
 I knew then the choices to make... 
 (Shad) 
 I'll never understand how it felt 
 When my mom lost her dad 
 Her sister and the only brother that she ever had 
 And I'll never know what's more sad 
 The fact they could've been spared 
 Or the fact that to this day nobody cares 
 For the innocent 
 Victims of a full-fledged holocaust 
 Because folks only holler if the cost 
 Of dollars lost is high 
 So regardless of the number of lives 
 When poor blacks die 
 They always turn a blind eye 
 And I'll never understand why... 
 (Bernadette) 
 I untied the chains 
 Letting go 
 Of those who converged on my dad 
 Beating 
 Pounding 
 Leaving him dead 
 I untied the chains 
 Letting go 
 Of those who propelled the grenade 
 Scattering my brother's brains 
 I untied the chains 
 Letting go 
 Of those who knifed my sister's throat 
 Leaving her begging for a better death 
 I untied the chains 
 Painfully 
 Purposefully 
 Knowing the one who said to do it 
 Seventy times seven 
 Totally understands the depth of my pain... 
 (Shad) 
 I'll never understand how people can go on and live 
 The miracle of finding the strength to forgive 
 To resurrect peace, to close up wounds so deep 
 They pierce souls beneath heart beats 
 To be a willful slave to a loving God's commands 
 The key to a freedom that I'll never understand.
