Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Let's go 
 Warmest wishes to those that chose to visit the show 
 Frigid flow: my tongue might stick to a pole 
 What I'm spitting is cold, Michigan snow 
 Listen though I don't put on airs, I'm conditioned to blow 
 I'm a star, my sis called me that 
 Back before my posse rapped 
 That's when the older homies told me "Just don't be a copycat" 
 Ok, copy that, handed the walkie talkie back 
 This is real pride in my eyes, it's not a cocky act 
 Look at us struggling and look how those at the top react 
 Not saying they're Nazis, I'm just saying how can they not see that? 
 It's still a white world, they don't even want that coffee black 
 No prime time, they don't even want that Cosby black? 
 Man, a lot of cats wanna see the best watch 
 Well if you want to see the best, watch 
 This is like Redd Fox mixed with a TED talk 
 Mixtape icon sitting on your desktop 
 Stop 
 I'm still telling my people to let that light shine 
 I never thought on the day I started to write rhymes 
 That I might climb and now it's like I 
 Just may be Jay Z in my lifetime 
 'Cause ooh, look at how I'm killing these tracks 
 I'm a vet but not the type of vet that's feeling these cats 
 Where the real Emcees at? I'm dying I need to hear someone as ill as me, stat 
 Mmhmm, Shadrach on racks putting these raps on wax 
 I don't usually go this fast on tracks but I'm zoning you know it when I laugh and my hat's on back 
 I don't rap for not fat contracts, till the day that I pass on 
 I deliver every jawn like my last song, last class with a graduation cap on 
 Brapp 
 I searched so far for you 
 I work so hard, find me 
 I take a gasp of air like I can't breathe 
 I want to sit beside her like I can't leave 
 I open up my eyes like I can't see 
 I just want to climb trees so I plant seeds 
 I walk forever looking for a place to sit 
 Feels like I'm just beginning though they're wishing I would quit 
 I'm trying to find my spirit while they're trying to find a hit 
 Been to the motherland now I search for the mother ship 
 I walk miles in shoes worn as torn paper eyes wide in the eye of the storm 
 I found peace in a mirror, that's me, I died as I tried to conform 
 I've been squinting, it's so bright but light is reflected inside of my skin 
 I've been searching outside for an answer like I couldn't find it within 
 I searched so far for you 
 I work so hard, find me 
 This life is a hell steps from heaven 
 Fear is a jail I'm in a cell next to legends 
 Ask Kheaven what his view through these bars looks like 
 If you still think there's wrongs that these songs could write 
 Goodnight... 
 Yo, throwing 'em bows 
 Blazing these rappers dressed up in their fancy clothes 
 Everyone knows your reign is over 'cause you chose 
 Material riches over the rap essentials 
 Ontario provincial it's not a minstrel show 
 Poet Allen Ginsberg flow really with nah know 
 Biddy bi bam bo rappers be shucking and jiving like Bojangles 
 Lyrically Van Gogh, I tango then eat a mango that fell 
 On a galvanized roof in Trinidad when I was a youth just coming up 
 Rappers be dumbing down, Kheaven be dumbing up 
 We living, what? We living on a prayer in the air, it's the Elohim 
 Shadrach, Kamau, we in to blast the scene 
 That's why we mould them, just like I told them 
 We leaving mics frozen 'cause we are the chosen
