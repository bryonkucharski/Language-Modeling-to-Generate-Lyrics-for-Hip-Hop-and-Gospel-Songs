Thank you, I thank you 
 Yeah, after all the turmoil and test 
 The heat broiling the sweet toil and then sweat 
 I might hang up this b-boy and then step 
 To a chalk board and take a seat poised at a desk 
 Still talking to youth, still talking it through 
 Then sat when I Black Christopher walk in a booth 
 Dropping some truth and I picked off with this route 
 I'm travelling many times I've gotten lost in pursuit 
 Didn't always get it right some decisions I've questioned 
 From behind the mic when I spit in the session 
 I'm talking life but not giving no lessons 
 Some show me light I just give a reflection 
 Of the best pieces of my hometown 
 Police in the whole crowd round the old streets we would hold down 
 No doubt that commitment's giving me hope now 
 Good ground so mad seeds can grow out 
 I look up to y'all and when I look back 
 I'm looking forward to more pictures to look at 
 G the rooms we never thought we could pack 
 I knew I should try, I knew I could rap 
 But talking honest I never thought I'd be good at 
 Man it's a jungle out here for a hood rat 
 Pray for a good cat see how I put that 
 Ah I'm gassed 
 Thank you, I thank you 
 Thank you, I thank you 
 Skip 
 (Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity 
 This moment of honesty) 
 Mhmm, truthfully I wanna rhyme like Common sense 
 And make that good music like Consequence 
 They say my rhyming is a constant mix 
 Of blacking out on tracks then bringing consciousness 
 Shouts to my circle my circumference 
 For all the IOU's no consonance 
 Yeah my whole crew they gave me confidence 
 My few confidants, out to all my friends 
 And now I'm proud of my van and my Vancouver apartment 
 A proud man is a man who went through hardships 
 Don't say you can't, you can do it regardless 
 To the fans that helped us get started 
 The fam I gotta 
 Thank you, I thank you 
 Yeah 
 And send peace to the nation of Rwanda 
 Where my momma and my father stay and pray for all my concerts 
 Not for props for honesty and honour in my conduct 
 See I was always taught to act my age and not my genre 
 And I'm just a product of the way that I was brought up 
 With Bradley Bravada and the aw-shucks persona 
 My T Dotters have got it hot as a sauna 
 Watching this rock college and cropper down at the Mod Club 
 And T's gotta send a shout out to 'Sauga 
 He wants to say thank you and tell Hazel to holla' 
 It's all love from the talks to the pot lucks 
 Grandview, Cotton, I'm awestruck 
 I gotta 
 Thank you, I thank you 
 Thank you, I thank you
