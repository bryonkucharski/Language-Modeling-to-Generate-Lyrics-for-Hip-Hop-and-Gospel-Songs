Yo, I ain't no hard hustlin muscle man thug on the curb 
 The only time I use a bullet is on Microsoft Word 
 Slick talk you could say I got grease on my speech 
 From years of rhymin' with a fried chicken piece in my teeth 
 But now I'm more self sufficient the food in my shelves and kitchen give my cells nutrition the help with my health conditions 
 While I never been too stable cerebrally radio frequency rappers still ain't able to equal me 
 Plus I link with (???) 'cause the phatter the beats, the words I'm battlin' peeps while I'm scattering speech like jabs to your cheeks shattering teeth drop the dagger in deep rattlin jeeps with bass levels that no ladder can reach 
 Shad be that freak with them 5 mic classics 
 Still rappin' on the street and sellin' tapes out his jacket 
 No lights in action in the places I bust a flow 
 The only rap videos I make are instructional 
 Trust the full power my verse packs and closed the kitchen I worked at when they heard how I serve cats 
 (So are you wild?) 
 Like girls gone with them Mardi Gras pearls on 
 (But Canada can't bring it) 
 I'm here to prove the world wrong 
 The real deal, I'm just tryin' to keep my wheels steel 
 I work fightin' in a box office like Kill Bill 
 I'm chill live freestylin' to jams, the crowds flip 'cause my rhyme style's wilder than Vans 
 And my DJ's nice on the tables like coasters 
 Were tryin' to see all the honey's wavin' our posters 
 Cause yo, they don't dig it, I ain't tryin' to be hyped out with a mic I'm cold lighting the Brian McKnight, rappin's done 
 Forget the verbal wrecks, I'm singin' back at one in purple max turtle necks and khakis, son 
 No shame, burn slow brains like propane, it's just Shad no add-ons or code names 
 Like cocaine when I do lines, the new rhymes is dope 
 I do the thing wild like my name is Tone-Loc 
 More wild than the west was when Kool Moe Dee an OG bringin' the sickest drama since The OC 
 In a crazy world meanin' I'm sane 
 In a break from all this nonsense they're feedin' your brain 
 While Nas and Janet halftimes (?) when this cat signs 
 I'll own the masters like Tiger and get green like a back nine 
 And I don't make the cash mine and that's fine 
 I'd rather live with these ups and downs than flat-line 
 Still, my jams rock the body like kidney stones, 
 When I pass through, I got more soul than Shaq's shoe 
 I be receivin' more paper than a fax do 
 For inspiration I draw on people like a tattoo artist, 
 Regardless of the hardships we face, 
 The world ain't so cold when your heart is embraced 
 So grace is the home where I rest in pieces of dead skin on my couch 
 Speaking with brethren and spittin' punch line with that stupid smile 
 That go your crew sayin' "Ha!" like Juvenile 
 If I'm on your radio then don't you move the dial 
 Just snap your neck to the music like you knew it's wild.
