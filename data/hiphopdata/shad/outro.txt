Yah Beautiful 
 Dangerous season the fall of youth 
 Souls wither like gold diggers, we follow suit 
 The booth is starting to feel small 
 I should feel appalled, 
 Instead I feel it all and can't call it 
 My heroes have the heart to lose the life I wanna live, 
 In the end I'm hoping that I take less than I give, 
 We go through stages, I ain't talkin' bout gigs, 
 And I ain't talkin' bout famous when I talk about big. 
 Pathetic poetics, connect my life to my words 
 Some cause play-back pain right to the nerves 
 For me it's hard to hear, that you're hard to hear 
 Didn't believe I was deaf till some check started clearin 
 Now that's a different kind of clarity, 
 And love for your brother, 
 That's a different kind of charity 
 Ya I rap fearlessly 
 But I act carelessly 
 When I'm busy on my grizzly 
 I'm a quarter bi-polar bear 
 With me, the rarest breed 
 Naw I'm just a parakeet 
 I talk what I hear 
 I do as they do 
 And I hate what I fear you see 
 A simple animal, sin is sincerity 
 But when I get carried away 
 You carry me TSOL
