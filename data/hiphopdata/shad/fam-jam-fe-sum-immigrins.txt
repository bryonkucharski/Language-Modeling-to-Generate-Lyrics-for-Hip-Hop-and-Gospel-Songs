(I'm proud of my nephew) 
 Yeah 
 (I'm proud of my nephew, my niece) 
 Yeah, well, no, mostly the nephew, this is focusing on the nephew 
 (Especially the one in Toronto) 
 Yeah, this is the one 
 (Not bad huh, for some immigrants) 
 From donated clothes, to caps and gowns 
 It's a little shout to my black and brown 
 Folks that know the game, not in class to clown 
 Had the funny accent, look who's laughing now 
 See Samir came here to grind, and he slaved at 
 Every minimum wage job, but he saved that 
 Brought his sis through on scholarship to make stacks 
 Working as a surgeon she bought a whip, and paid cash 
 No time to whine, we just face facts 
 Let's fit 6 in the back and let's take that 
 To the best restaurants, make reservations 
 Since we out here, since they made reservations for 
 First Nations and they never made reparations 
 The Natives probably relate more to immigration 
 So just for y'all too, and I can't forget the Haitians 
 Here for an education, it's a celebration

 (Not bad huh, for some immigrants) 
 To the guys that draw lines and make the borders real 
 But then bend the rules when there's more to drill 
 Don't turn away the stateless, think of the waste 
 If one in 3 refugees is a Lauryn Hill 
 Come along way, you can move forward still 
 From the poorest to up by Lawrence or Forest Hill 
 But more than that, skrillery banks just chill 
 Make a home, just build in a zone, less ill 
 In a place to be safe, few found an escape route 
 Where we come from, so we grateful to Jesus 
 And now the top is the next stop, this drop 
 Oughtta have my Aunts on the guest spot, red hot 
 I'm talking going from sweatshops to tech stocks 
 Doctors Without Borders, with dreadlocks 
 We quoting S.Dot Carter on Otis 
 Turns out some fresh off the boat kid wrote this 
 ...Not bad

 Now when you're Third World born, but First World formed 
 Sometimes you feel pride, sometimes you feel torn 
 See my Mother's tongue is not what they speak where my Mother's from 
 She moved to London with her husband when their son was 1 
 And one time after Family Ties, I turned on the news and saw my family die 
 (Why?) Pops said there's murder in the motherland 
 Things about colonialism I didn't understand 
 All the things that shape a man in his mind state; 
 A community income, and crime rate 
 If times change, why my people still in dire straits 
 If it's a big world, show me where's my place 
 In it, I had to talk to Pops for a minute 
 He said, "Shad, this world wasn't home to begin with 
 Just keep defending the oppressed, take steps 
 And keep rapping, you might just be the best" 
 Well, yes
