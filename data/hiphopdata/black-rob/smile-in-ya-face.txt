They smile in ya face, but they ain't lovin' you 
 Turn your back, they tryin' to break your J-A-W 
 Who a nigga on the run, eatin P.O.W.s 
 Strapped with arrows, and the chrome b-o-w? 
 It's no act yo, no 
 This chick can keep my dick between her cheek and gums, like tobacco 
 On the F.D.R. doin' like 90 a pop 
 Fuck five-0 niggaz too grimey to stop 
 All we came to do was tear up the spot 
 Think we care if you, you, you, roll behind us or not? 
 I'm the one man army, the one hand on the tommy 
 If you standing next to me, one hand on your mommy 
 Your arms too short to box with Rob 
 Swipe your face like the Bad Boy corporate card 
 A lotta shit I do is off the hard 
 And I be like shhh, that's why the Feds don't wanna talk to Rob 
 Y'all had to go force the god, naw I ain't got nothin' to prove 
 Ain't gotta carry the two, see my daddy told me bury them fools 
 And remember this rule: don't fuck with niggaz that ain't fuckin' with you 
 So when you're home with nothin' to do 
 Just get comfortable, 'cause they ain't doin' nothin' to you 
 And they can take it like they wanna take it, I ain't just a rapper 
 Certified Harlem knight, Mister Will-Bust-A-Cap-er 
 Heyyo, one two three, to get to them you got to get through me 
 And it's the Bad Boy family tree, like I said we gonna do this shit, nonstop 
 And my sole purpose is makin' you dance 
 Ladies scream "Blackie, Blackie gimme one more chance!" 
 Now she backstage hand in my pants 
 I been tryin' to tell myself, I gotta stop fuckin' my fans 
 Like Mi-chelle, uh, my belle 
 Sucked my dick so well I took her on tour, bitch was so raw 
 Nice tits, fat boomty, ak, y'know what I'm sayin'? 
 Passed it off to Puff and Loon, wit no delayin 
 The average nigga walk around here sad 
 Get the chronic now he honest he gon' bust that ass 
 Get home, she ain't there, bitch musta mashed 
 And she caught you for furs and your jewels and cash 
 Shoulda known it 
 Me, I could never condone it 
 Bum bitch walk around my shit like she own it 
 She got some bitch niggaz involoved, they be in cars 
 That used to shoot dice in back of the ?m rob? 
 All praise due to them papers, got me watchin my neighbors 
 If I don't know you do me no favors 
 And that's comin' from the horses mouth, reppin east west and south 
 Nigga front we airin him out 
 Old timer said "Don't leave the label till you're paid 
 And hold yours down from the cradle to the grave" 
 Sharp as the cut the barber gave you with the shave 
 Handgun, but you harder wit the gauge 
 So go ahead front for us, we savage 
 It's war, consider this collateral damage 
 And we even did some joints in Spanish 
 We control the entire zone and punks sayin' ?bi amon? 
 That explains why I'm not home 
 That explains why I'm low, in videos I'm not shown
