(Feat. Puff Daddy) 
 Verse one: black rob 
 I met her uptown on dikeland, to heighten 
 Talkin' that, how she only dealt with businessmen 
 Niggaz baggin joints, money off and on the books 
 The ones who stand firm like ain't, nuttin shook 
 About them, I doubt them cats waitin for me 
 You know them niggaz, them big dudes across the street 
 She say, 'yeah, they from over on mayfair' 
 Bullets from out of nowhere, told her to stay there and duck down 
 I hit the ground but managed to pull a piece out 
 This bitch over them with them pointin the chief out 
 They want beef out here, they gon' get it 
 In the worst way, I'ma show 'em how black play 
 Roll the dice, fuckin' with me is like snake eyes 
 I break guys, sit back and watch my cake rise 
 It's all about the benjamins, true that be the motto 
 Ran out of ammo and started, throwin' bottles 
 Runnin', and I ain't lookin' back for shit 
 Crooked ass bitch, today I get you back for this 
 (I'll get you back) 
 Chorus: repeat 2x 
 I love you baby no you don't 
 You drive me crazy that's right 
 I'll never betray thee uh 
 I love you baby c'mon 
 Verse two: black rob (starts rapping during the chorus) 
 Yo since the last altercation I been goin' to street 
 Seein honey at the club ery week and I speak 
 I'ma rock that ass to sleep before I strike 
 I ain't know the real deal until last night 
 How, one of them brothers was locked with bankroll 
 Used to call my crib to see seventy-four 
 Kick rhymes over the phone for hours he had the dac 
 Babe bro told him, 'you wanna get money, see black 
 When you get home', we never had chance to get up 
 And wouldn't have, if his gun had left me hit up 
 He'd explain how his whole crew was slappin honey 
 Besides all that, she owed them cats a lot of money 
 Funny how it's a small world, baby girl 
 Youse about to get, fucked with no jail 
 I'ma sit back and watch this cake finish bakin 
 And plan your extermination, word 
 Verse three: puff daddy 
 It took a while to peep your style, miss i-be-in-workin 
 Low profile single, house in staten island 
 And manhattan while, them same cats 
 You sent to get me boo, is on they to get you 
 Fuckin' witchu, that small time crack dealin' nigga 
 He a bitch too, they gon' bust his shit too 
 Shit's real, you think you gonna set me up 
 And get away scot free without some type of injury 
 Nah kill it, I'ma flip the script on you 
 Same thing you did to me, I'ma do it to you 
 Who knew she was the female rambo 
 Fill one of they chest with four soon as he came in the door 
 Life is out, snuffed all they man's in 
 In the end, she had to be the last bitch standin 
 Not for long the buck the forty-four strong 
 Just like that she was gone, now it's over 
 Assumin I'll go back to my everyday life 
 Of a rich millionaire just rockin' the mic 
 Gotta pause, and think about honey no doubt 
 And admire how the chick went out 
 Chorus: repeat to fade
