 I am about to set the record straight (the world's famous) 
 Its 99 man time to let them know man 
 Verse One: 
 Yo aiyo yo yo 
 Its kill or be killed 
 My skillz leavin' them chilled on ice 
 Like twice when I flash my steel 
 They can't touch 
 Won't touch 
 Never touch 
 Driving around with the toastly whip, never bust 
 Puffin dust like fiends 
 I mean I want green ya shifty 
 Cop the big eight fifty with the gleam 
 My team 
 Full of cut throats with enough notes to write a fuckin' book 
 Take a good fucking look at these bad guys 
 Stay madd fly, madd high 
 In the ford expidie and I don't expect to die 
 On some humble shit 
 I am on some rumble shit 
 When it's on you should see the shit I come through with 
 If you scared by dog release the four by fours 
 I heard the fagot ass Don died and he shit in his draws 
 On the streets black good like allstate ya all fake 
 Just got paid but fuck it I want some more cake 
 Ya faith, in my hand 
 Now ya nervous man and drive my brains quick fast at ya service 
 My brother Curtis squezze gats to celliums 
 I make it where you can't escape the parra bedlums 
 I tell some, live ya life like Puff did 
 I did enough biz ask any body I am rough kid

 Verse Two: G-Dep 
 Yo, yo 
 I put a finger in the air 
 For the hearing impaired 
 If you're hearin this fear 
 Than your hearing it cleared 
 Man I fuck with bod, got put on the job 
 Don't question it to stars, I'ma put'em in saw 
 Straight gate 
 I suggest you vacate 
 When I shake, they feel earthquakes in eight states 
 Oh trait, off the Richter, drunk 
 Off the liquor 
 Shot towards you mister 
 Off course it hit you hard 
 It gets hard, I pick the card 
 Any card any problem I'ma hit your squad 
 Eyes on the shapar when I twisted god 
 You think you got it all together 
 Get it ripped apart 
 Man you can't stand the heat 
 Stay up outta the street 
 Nigga turn po-lice 'cause they shot up his jeep 
 I subtract like mad 
 Don't make me blad 
 So I want it all, fuck had 
 Don't make me laugh 
 By all means 
 Get this money it's all green 
 It's all good 
 And I wished that y'all would 
 Man fuck that, security told ya to tuck that 
 Now up that, now that you see where lux at 
 I got the game by the balls 
 And I get all calls 
 So if you play to much I put the shit on pause
