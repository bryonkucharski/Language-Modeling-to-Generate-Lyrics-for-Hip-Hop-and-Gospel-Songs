I never knew there was a 
 Love like this before 
 Never had someone to show me a love 
 Love like this before 
 Now that we have, come to be 
 A brand new light, I can see 
 Never thought you'd be 
 A special, part of me, no baby 
 The reasons are because of you 
 I can go on and make it through 
 I can't even take my mind off lovin' you 
 And I wanna say 
 I never knew there was a 
 Love like this before (A love like this before, no) 
 Never had someone to show me a love 
 Love like this before 
 I know, you can't see 
 All the things you mean to me 
 I'm so amazed that you are mine 
 Yeah yeah, yeah yeah 
 If we can work together 
 Maybe this can last forever 
 This is somethin' that I wanna hold on to 
 So baby, try to understand 
 Baby, try to understand 
 I'll be crazy if you leave 
 'Cause you compliment my style 
 And I like the way you walk 
 And the sexy things you talk 
 You don't know just what you do to me 
 You see I never 
 I never knew there was a 
 Love like this before (A love like this before, no) 
 Never had someone to show me a love (Ooh I never had a) 
 Love like this before

 Love like this before (Never knew, never knew) 
 Never had someone to show me a love 
 Love like this before 
 Baby, try to understand 
 I'll be crazy if you leave 
 'Cause you compliment my style 
 And I like the way you walk 
 And the sexy things you talk 
 You don't know just what you do to me 
 You see I never 
 Never knew a 
 Never knew a 
 Never knew a 
 Love like this before 
 Never knew a 
 Never knew a 
 Never knew a 
 Love like this before 
 I never knew there was a 
 Love like this before (Never had somebody) 
 Never had someone to show me a love 
 Love like this before

 Love like this before (I never knew but I'll find you) 
 Never had someone to show me a love 
 Love like this before
