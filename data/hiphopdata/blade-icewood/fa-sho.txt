(Talking) 
 Yeah, though I walk alone 
 The shadow doubts of steps looking to come for us 
 But too many people come around for the same reasons 
 We all go down to the faces of the law 
 Run around scared like little... never come up 
 Stay broke forever... 
 If you catch me towing weight in any city or state 
 'Cause my hustle will never stop like a car on bad breaks 
 A jar with no shake, makes it come back gravy 
 When you using A1, the fiends come back crazy 
 The blaze be quick, u need a scope and a beam 
 I be in O.C.J. sporting blues and gray 
 Get out the next day, AK your brains nigga 
 Saying you have to see hova, and I ain't talking 'bout jigga 
 Have ya boys on the block, pissed pouring out liquor 
 Sporting white tees with ya face all on the picture 
 And if you live it's guaranteed that the dot gone stitch ya 
 Get ya main hoe to love me, cut, soon as I hit her 
 You know how Blade get down, flood the city with pounds 
 Pushing in the Caddy drug Thirty G's on the sounds 
 Or spinning rims bigger then the table you eat dinner on 
 See I'm getting money that's the type of shit I spend it on 
 If your money right (that's fa sho) 
 If you a boss out here (that's fa sho) 
 Tell boys when you ride (that's fa sho) 
 Keep a heater on your side (that's fa sho) 
 You know my name mean money dog (uh huh) 
 And yeah this a throw they hands up (throw ya hands up) 
 Or banging this in they ride 
 Or rolling down the nine five 
 It's real life here dog, this ain't no movie 
 So much work when I cook up I use a jacuzzi 
 Silencer uzi, so I can hit you quiet but quick (shhh) 
 What up to my dogs locked down, rook, jesse, and rick 
 Dogg, I've been getting cheese since the early nineties (uh huh) 
 In the D it's gutta dog, even the hoes is grimey 
 See every second counts so my time is precious 
 Turn my watch into a castle and filled it with prince's 
 Commissary, safe code, I was up in the pod 
 Eighty-seven chevy, Fifty G's in my garage 
 And if I put my hand's on you it won't be a massage (uh uhn) 
 Fuck with me get smoked quicker than a weeded cigar 
 Should've kept ya mouth shut now look what happened 
 Adding up my bank damn all this from rapping 
 Pimp, I got old stacks I ain't touched in years 
 Everywhere scream my name like norman cheers (blaaaade!) 
 I be at the Lion's game drunk off plenty of beers 
 Use to be the Silverdome, now we at Ford Field 
 After words, hit the network with Kiahn grille 
 I represent the money getting, Detroit niggaz for real 
 I've been in the studio with all types of emcees 
 Some from Cali, N.O., to NYC 
 Gangsta got cheese, still gank ya nigga 
 Original Chedda Boys 'cause our bank is bigger (yeah) 
 I don't sport ice no more, I sport frost, I'ma boss 
 Run that nigga, fuck what it cost 
 Took a little loss bounced back quicker than a dribble 
 Filled my crib with flat screens since my bank done tripled 
 Riding like I'm crippled, roll more than a wheelchair 
 Put niggas down harder then hits from a steel chair 
 And I'm in a big move, six figures a flip 
 And I keep low pro so the feds won't trip 
 Then dip to a island for a nice vacation 
 Got a hand clap longer then a standing ovation 
 Getting cheese by any means, that's my occupation 
 Sell dope, a little real estate and rock it on stations 
 Cartier watch look like a iced dog cage 
 Money counters with a mapper I be countin' days 
 Purple haze, ghanz, drow, don't smoke no bamma 
 Put ya ass six feet like the old Jordan Jammer
